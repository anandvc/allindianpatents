FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of high molecular weight micron sized polymer, having improved processing characteristics including high surface to volume ratio from millimeter sized polymer.<br>
BACK GROUND AND PRIOR ART OF INVENTION<br>
Polymer particles of different shapes and sizes are critical in numerous applications, including polymer blends or alloys, polymer powder spray coating, polymer powder impregnations of inorganic fibers in composites and in polymer-supported heterogeneous catalysis. Recently, significant commercial and scientific attention has been focused on multicomponent polymer system as a means for producing new material on the micrometer and nanometer scale. Composites, polymer particles or polymer alloys with specifically tailored properties could find many novel uses in such field as electro-optic and luminescent devices, thermoplastics and conducting materials, hybrid inorganic-organic polymer alloys, and polymer supported heterogeneous catalysis.<br>
Significance of nano or micron sized polymers: The importance of nano or micron sized polymers is primarily due to their novel properties and small size. In fact, these are dimensionally larger than so called atoms and yet smaller than the conventional polymer powders with most of the comprising species lying on the surface itself. To be precise, the unique properties of these materials arise due to their low dimension and large surface to volume ratios.<br>
A variety of methods are available to produce nanomaterials (not for polymers). The coating with organic molecules keeps the nature of metal clusters intact. It is now possible to deposit two- and three- dimensional arrays of clusters on substrates and at specific sites/intervals. Ligand and stabilized metal cluster in size range of 1-2 nm behave like quantum dots where a few electrons are locked up. Their special character opens up applications in nano- and optoelectronics, photo voltaics, etc. A lithography process with accelerated clusters has been developed to modify surfaces of silicone, quartz and diamond through erosion/reaction.<br>
Ultrafine metal particles based polymers and amorphous films of cage-structured clusters (e.g., metcars, bucky balls) can now be produced. Metal clusters isolated in zeolites show<br>
interesting photochromic and magnetic properties. The use of scanning tunnelling and atomic force microscopes (STM and AFM) to rearrange atoms and clusters on substrates and manipulate them to draw nanowires is well demonstrated. Further, cluster deposited multilayers have found to develop nanowires that are characterized by giant magnetoresistance.<br>
The ultra fast response time and photochemical inertness of nanocluster composites of metal quantum dots make them ideal non-linear materials for optical switching and electro-optical devices. Their linear wave-guide qualities allow them to transmit as many as five modes. The resonance absorption in visible and near infrared region observed in metal island film is attributed to optical anisotropy in the critical condition-making them potential candidate for ultrathin optical polarizers. Aligned carbon nanotube films in the polymer matrix may find application as a large area field emission electron source.<br>
Newer theoretical approaches can now simulate large size cluster. The geometrical optimization process becomes faster with use of genetic algorithm in directing the growth of clusters in minimum energy configurations. The growth of cluster is found to depend largely upon the nature of the substrate and accompanying magic numbers differ completely from usual gas phase situations. Real time simulations of cluster melting, growth, dynamics, etc are now possible. There exists a basis to believe now that quasicrystals are results of packing small atomic clusters.<br>
The most important question arises is about the possibility of cluster assembly in a way similar to atoms/molecules in crystals and thereby forming a new class of periodic structures exhibiting unique structural and electronic properties. The key lies in suppressing coalescence of atomic clusters and preventing possible reactions with the environmental species to ensure their stability.<br>
The commercial polyethylene (low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, liner low density polyethylene, etc) is synthesized by the Ziegler process using aluminium trialkyl-TiCLt complex as catalyst, Phillips process using CrO3 as catalyst and Standard oil process using molybdenum as catalyst. The synthesis of commercial polypropylene became possible through the commercial utilization of co-ordination polymerization during 1957-60. Propylene, the monomer, is obtained from the cracking of petroleum products. Similarly the commercial polystyrene is synthesized by the bulk and suspension polymerization (and the emulsion process to a lesser extent). Hence, the knowledge about synthesis, properties and uses of commercial polymers such as polystyrene/ polypropylene / polyethylene existed since 1960. The size of this commercial polyethylene is ~ 2-5 mm in diameter.<br>
Regarding the synthesis of polymer (polyethylene) at the micron sized has been reported by Otaigbe et al. through gas atomizing technique [Otaigbe JU, Noid DW, Sumpter BG (1998) Advances in Polymer Technol. 17:161] without mentioning its molecular weight. The yield is less than 0.01% and particle sizes ranging from 25-200 urn. In this technique, the polymer is melted at a high temperature and passed through an orifice into a vacuum chamber. Spherical ultra-fine polymer particles (10-35 nm) are prepared by chemical polymerization of aniline in an inverse water-in-oil micro emulsion [Chan HSO, Ming L, Chew CH, Ma L, Seow SH., (1993) J Mater Chem 3:1109 ,Xu, XL, Chew, CH., Siow, KS., Wong, MK., and Gan, L.M., (1999), Langmuir, 15:8067, Anderson, CD., Sudol, ED., and El-Aasser, MS., (2002), Macromolecules, 35:574, Ries, MM., Araujo, PHH., Sayer, C, Giudici, R., (2003), Polymer, 44:6123 , Klein, M., US Patent 4,207,378, June 1980, Wang, X., Foltz, VJ, Sadhukhan, P. US patent 6,689,469, February 2004].<br>
This micro emulsion method provides a denser, more uniform and compact film of higher condensation than that produced in an aqueous medium. But the molecular weight of polymer is less than 20,000. However, the synthesis of high molecular weight micron/nano sized polystyrene was not known due to the lack of sufficient knowledge about the controlling factors which are responsible for the formation of single polymeric chain.<br>
Generally number average molecular weight of polymers is exist greater than 1,00,000 and available in granular form having diameter is more than 2 mm. Due to its high molecular weight, it was not possible to prepare polymers at nano or micro scale. The afore-said mentioned processes were unable to prepare a high molecular weight polymer having a dimension of micron/nano sized particles.<br>
The present process provides a solution to the above-said problems for preparation of high molecular weight polymers of micro sized particles through the close control of thermodynamic parameters. The present invention report the controlled preparation of spherical and high molecular weight micron sized polymer such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. These are widely used through out our life including biomedical, aerospace and automobile industries. In spite of that the molecular theories to explain the unusual behavior of long chain molecules are limited. Because these long chain molecules are exist in coil form. It was not possible to prepare single polymer chain. At the same time the inexpensive production techniques suitable for down to earth industries are not available. This new high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene will help the researcher to establish a new molecular theories for the unusual behavior of long chain molecules. The technique adopted to prepare the high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene will help the researchers to prepare all type of polymers. The high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene has promise for wide range of applications, viz., catalysis,<br>
photography, substrate for microelectronics, piezoelectric devices, electronic components, electron source, etc in India. Considering the current and future needs it is our interest to initiate a strong research programme in this area to foster our industries to adopt newer processing routes for manufacturing their products with superior specifications and also introduce new products based on unique properties of this class of new generation materials. Again due to the availability of various types of high molecular weight micron sized polymers in near future this proposed technique is likely to increase the production of fiber reinforced plastic components satisfactorily. This will in turn enhance the interest of laboratories and industries.<br>

Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through the distribution of particle size:<br>
The measurements of particle size's distribution were done by Laser particle sizer-<br>
Analysette 22. Ethyl alcohol was used as a solvent for this experiment. The particle size<br>
distribution of high molecular weight micron  sized polyethylene, polypropylene and<br>
polystyrene obtained using the novel technique is shown in Figs 2, 3 and 4 respectively. It is<br>
clear from the Fig. 2 that the novel technique produces high molecular weight micron sized<br>
polyethylene within a range of 0.17 to 47 µm. It also suggests that 5% high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene have a diameter of less than 1 µm and 55% high molecular weight polymer less<br>
than 30 µm. In addition to this it is also worth to mention here this technique produces<br>
micron sized polymer with a yield of 100%.<br>
From the Fig 3 it is also clear that the novel technique produces high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene within a range of 0.17 to 40 µm. It suggests that 11% high molecular weight polypropylene have a diameter of less than 1 µm and 49% high molecular weight polymer less than 20 µm. Again it is also worth to mention here this technique produces micron sized polymer with a yield of 100%.<br>
Fig. 4 shows that the novel technique produces high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene within a range of 0.17 to 51 µm. This suggests that 9% high molecular weight polystyrene have a diameter of less than 1 µm and 37% high molecular weight polystyrene are less than 9 µm. Similarly it is also worth to mention here this technique produces micron sized polystyrene with a yield of 100%.<br>
Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through the surface area:<br>
The surface area of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene was measured by "COULTER™ SA 3100™ Series Surface Area and Pore Size<br>
^Analyzers". The BET surface area is calculated for high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene using the following Equations (10) and (11) and Figs 5, 8,11 and 14:<br>
My<br>
where VM, VA, PS, P0, C and SBET are the volµme of the mono-layer, volµme adsorbed, sample pressure, saturation pressure and constant related to the enthalpy of adsorption and BET surface area respectively. The BET surface area reveals its minimµm surface area of 16.2 m2/gm (calculated from Figs 5, 8, 11 and 14). Similarly the BET surface area for high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene is 16.2 m2/gm (calculated from Figs 6, 9, 12, and 15 and Equations (10) and (11)). Figs 7, 10, 13 and 16 reveal its minimµm surface area of 17.7 m2/gm (calculated by Equations (10) and (11)).<br>
Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through scanning electron microscopy:<br>
The particle size and morphology of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene were also determined by using a JEOL JSM 840A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Prior to SEM studies, the samples were sputter coated with gold without touching the surface. The micro graph (Fig. 17) shows that the high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene is spherical in nature. To avoid the thermal degradation of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene the photograph is taken at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and magnification of 550. Fig. 18 shows the micrograph of high molecular weight polypropylene at a magnification of 550 and an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The micrograph of high molecular weight polystyrene at a magnification of 800 is shown in Fig. 19. The accelerating voltage was 5 kV.<br>
Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through infrared spectroscopy analysis<br>
The infrared spectrµm of commercial high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene was studied by "BRUKER VECTOR 22" infrared spectrometer. Infrared (IR) spectra were used to find out the difference in chemical structure between the commercial high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene. Fig. 20 shows the IR spectra of commercial high density polyethylene. The positions of all peaks are sµmmarized in Table 1. The peak positions at 2800-2950 cm"1 (broad peak), 1466 cm'1 (strong peak),<br>
1365 cm-1 (strong peak) and 724 cm-1 (strong peak) are assigned to the -C-H stretching, -C-H vibration, -C-H symmetric vibration and -C-H rocking respectively. The other two peaks 730 and 720 cm-1 (strong) is orthorhombic crystalline structure of commercial high density polyethylene. The 723 cm-1 peak position is associated with the amorphous fraction of the commercial high density polyethylene. But the 717 cm-1 is assigned to the monoclinic crystalline structure of commercial high density polyethylene. The IR spectra of commercial low density polyethylene is also included in the same Fig. 20 for the comparison purpose. The peak at 1462 cm-1 is assigned to bending vibration in all trans methylene chain sequence outside the crystal structure. The 723 cm-1 is assigned to the -CH2 rocking mode. The IR spectra of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene is also included in the same Fig. 20. It is very interesting to note that there is no difference in chemical structure between the commercial high density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene. From this observation we can claim that both are same materials. But the size of the particle is in micro scale.<br>
Again the infrared spectra of crystalline polymers are complex due to the regular structure of the macromolecules. To simplify it, all spectra are classified into the four groups related to the various molecular structures: conformational band, stereoregularity band, regularity band and crystallinity band. Some absorption bands are very sensitive to the physical state of the samples. According to different origins, these sensitive bands are classified into two categories. One of these is related to the intramolecular forces in the crystal lattice, where the polymer molecules pack together on a regular three dimensional arrangement. This type of band is known as crystallinity band. The other type of band is related with the intramolecular vibration coupling with in a single chain and known as regularity band or helix band. The conformational band and regularity band are easily observed for crystallized polypropylene in the mid-infrared region. Fig. 21 shows the IR spectra of high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene. The position of all peaks are sµmmarized in Table 2. All of the 1370, 1301, 1254, 1219, 1161, 1103, 994, 975, 899, 840 and 810 cm-1 bands are belong to the regularity bands. They are associated with the different helical length of repeat unit (n). The minimµm n values for appearance of bands at 975, 994, 840 and 1219 cm-1 are 5, 10, 12 and 14 monomer units in helical sequence respectively. The higher is the common unit, the more is the order degree of the corresponding regularity band. Concerning the 975 cm-1 band, it is not only attributed to the polypropylene head to tail sequence of repeating units, but also associated with the presence of short helices. On the other hand the band at 1453 cm-1 is assigned to the asymmetric deformation vibration of the methyl group. The IR spectrµm of commercial polypropylene is also included in the same Fig. 21. It is very interesting to note that there is no difference in chemical structure between the commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene.<br>
Fig. 22 shows the IR spectra of commercial polystyrene. The position of all peaks is sµmmarized in Table 3. The peak positions at 3027 cm-1, 2885 cm-1, 1492 cm-1, 1370 cm-1<br>
and 757 cm-1 are assigned to the stretching of -C-H bond in phenyl ring, asymmetric stretching of -C-H bond, asymmetric stretching of-C-H bond, symmetric stretching of-C-H bond and rocking of-C-H bond in phenyl ring respectively. The other two peaks 901 and 851 cm-1 are associated to the a crystal form of commercial polystyrene. Another two peaks 911 and 855 cm-1 are assigned to the ß crystal form of commercial polystyrene. The IR spectra of high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene is also included in the same Fig. 22. It is very interesting to note that there is no difference in chemical structure between the commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene.<br>
Characterization of high density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through X-Ray Diffraction<br>
The XRD measurement was conducted in ordered to examine the crystallinity of the commercial high density polyethylene, commercial low density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene. It was evaluated by X- Ray Diffraction (XRD) using Rich Seifert Iso-Debyefle 202 Diffractometer with a CuKa (X= 1.54184 A) radiation. Fig. 23 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of commercial high density polyethylene, commercial low density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene. Two major peaks are identified in Fig. 23 for both polymers. These are 22 and 24° and shown in Fig. 26. The area under these peak increases from high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene to commercial high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene. This suggests that the high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene is more crystalline in nature<br>
The XRD measurement was also conducted in ordered to examine the crystallinity of the commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene. It is well known that the commercial polypropylene exhibits several different crystalline forms. These are monoclinic (a) form (including ai and (X2), trigonal (P) and triclinic (y) form and mesomorphic (smectic) form. The formation and their mutual phase transitions consist of a nµmber of intermediate stages based on rotations and transitions of the chains. It is again dependent on the crystallization conditions, molecular weight and tacticity of the polymer chain. Fig. 24 shows a characteristic X ray diffraction pattern of commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene. In this Figure the diffraction peaks of (300) plane of the p form and those of the (110), (040) and (130) planes of the a form are evident. These peak positions are tabulated in Table 4. Three main peaks for the commercial polypropylene (16.7, 18.5 and 21.1) and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene (16.8, 18.6 and 21.8) are identified for comparison of crystallinity and shown in the Fig. 27. The relative amount of p form is also determined by calculating K value (using Equation 12).<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
It shows that the high molecular weight micron sized polymer is more crystalline in nature.<br>
Similarly the XRD measurement was also conducted in ordered to examine the crystallinity of the commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene. Fig. 25 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene. Commercial polystyrene has four types of crystal form (a, P, y and 5) and two mesomorfic forms. It has been reported that the a- and ß- forms have trans planar zigzag (tttt),, backbone configuration, where as y- and 8- forms have a helical (trans, trans, gauche, gauche, (ttg+g+)n) backbone configuration. The a- form with a hexagonal unit cell and ß- form with an orthorhombic unit cell have an identity of c equal to 5.1 . The y- and 8- forms (both having an identity of c = 7.8 ) are monoclinic crystal structure. Among these four crystalline forms, the a- form (with a = 26.26 ) and p- form (with a = 8.81 , b = 28.82 ) are crystalline polymorphs. Few peaks for the commercial polystyrene (14.0, 16.7, 17.9, 18.4 and 19.7) and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene (14.0, 16.7, 18.2, 18.5 and 19.5) are identified for comparison of crystallinity and shown in the Table 5. The Fig. 28 also suggests that high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene is more crystalline with respect to the commercial polystyrene.<br>
Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through viscoelastic properties i.e., storage modulus<br>
The viscoelastic property, storage modulus was measured by Rheometric Scientific RDA III Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. The samples were analyzed in tension mode over a range of temperature from 35 to 125°C, frequency of 1, 2,5 and 10 Hz and heating rate of 5°C/min. The storage modulus describes the elastic behavior of the materials. The storage modulus at a frequency of 10 Hz for commercial high density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 29. It is very interesting to report that the storage modulus increases from commercial high density polyethylene to the high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene at each temperature. These findings are important because small diameter high molecular weight micron sized polymer is proved to be able to show good material properties without any confinement that limits its dimension.<br>
The storage modulus at a frequency of 10 Hz for commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 30. It is very interesting to report that the storage modulus increases from commercial polypropylene to the high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene at each temperature. This finding is also important because small diameter high molecular weight micron sized polymer is proved to be able to show good material properties without any confinement that limits its dimension.<br>
Similarly the storage modulus at a frequency of 10 Hz for commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 31. It is very interesting to report that the storage modulus increases from commercial polystyrene to the high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene at each temperature. Similarly this finding is also important because small diameter high molecular weight micron sized polymer is proved to be able to show good material properties without any confinement that limits its dimension.<br>
Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through viscoelastic properties i.e., loss modulus<br>
Another viscoelastic property i.e., loss modulus was measured by Rheometric Scientific RDA III Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer in tension mode over a range of temperature from 35 to 125°C, frequency of 1, 2,5 and 10 Hz and heating rate of 5°C/min. From these two parameters, the complex modulus and loss tangent are calculated. The loss modulus describes the viscous component of the materials. The loss modulus at a frequency of 10 Hz for commercial high density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 32.  It is very interesting to report that the loss<br>
modulus decreases from the high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene to the commercial high density polyethylene.<br>
Again the loss modulus at a frequency of 10 Hz for commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 33. It is also very interesting to report the same behaviour i.e., the loss modulus decreases from the high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene to the commercial polypropylene.<br>
Similarly the loss modulus at a frequency of 10 Hz for commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 34. Similarly the loss modulus decreases from the high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene to the commercial polystyrene. Again these findings are important because small diameter high molecular weight micron sized polymer is proved to be able to show good material properties without any confinement that limits its dimension.<br>
Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through viscoelastic properties i.e., loss tangent<br>
The loss tangent (another viscoelastic properties) was measured by Rheometric Scientific RDA III Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer in tension mode over a range of temperature from 35 to 125°C, frequency of 1, 2,5 and 10 Hz and hearing rate of 5°C/min. The loss tangent is a measure of the "damping or dissipation factor", defined as the ratio of the loss modulus, E" to the storage modulus, E\ Fig. 35 shows the effect of temperature on loss tangent for both commercial high density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene. It is also very interesting to report that the loss tangent decreases from the high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene to the commercial high density polyethylene. Again these findings are important because small diameter high molecular weight micron sized polymer is proved to be able to show good material properties without any confinement that limits its dimension.<br>
Fig. 36 shows the effect of temperature on loss tangent for both commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene. It is also very interesting to report that the loss tangent decreases from the high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene to the commercial polypropylene. Again it is claimed that small diameter high molecular weight micron sized polymer is proved to be able to show good material properties without any confinement that limits its dimension<br>
The effect of temperature on loss tangent for both commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene is shown in Fig. 37. It is also very interesting to report that the loss tangent decreases from the high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene to the commercial polystyrene.<br>
Characterization of high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene through thermogravimetric analysis<br>
*f hermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in a high resolution TGA 2950 of TA Instrµments, New Castle, USA over a range of temperature from 30°C to 550°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min in the nitrogen atmosphere. Thermal stability of commercial high density polyethylene and high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene is measured by TGA in the nitrogen atmosphere. Figs. 38 and 41 show that the commercial high density polyethylene starts to degrade at 250°C whereas the high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene starts to degrade at 243°C. These two figures also suggest the multiple steps of degradation. These multi steps degradation temperature for commercial high density polyethylene are 370, 395 and 427°C. But these multi steps degradation temperatures for high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene are 327,423, 454 and 485°C.<br>
Similarly thermal stability of commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene is measured by TGA in the nitrogen atmosphere. Fig. 39 shows that the commercial polypropylene starts to degrade at 256°C whereas the high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene starts to degrade at 228°C. The maximµm rate of degradation for commercial polypropylene and high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene are at temperature of 280 and 244°C respectively (Fig. 42). Fig. 40 shows that the TGA analysis of Commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene. Commercial polystyrene starts to degrade at 300°C whereas the high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene starts to degrade at 288°C. But the maximµm rate of degradation for commercial polystyrene and high molecular weight micron sized polystyrene are 325 and 343°C respectively (Fig. 43).<br>
Examples<br>
EXPERIMENT 1<br>
Preparation of High molecular weight micron sized polyethylene<br>
Drying of n-Hexane<br>
One liter of HPLC grade n-hexane was placed in a single necked, two liter round bottle flask. 100 gm of calciµm chloride was added into it. This mixture was allowed to keep for 12 hours and then decanted. Large percentage of water was removed during this period. Pressed sodiµm wires were pressed into the round bottle flask containing n-hexane, continuing the addition of the sodiµm wires until evolution of hydrogen bubbles was observed. After 3 hours a pinch of benzophenone (-0.1 gm) was added to the above round bottle flask (n-hexane + sodiµm wires). This was refluxed at a temperature of 110 to 120°C in an inert atmosphere, until it sustains dark blue colour. After sustaining the dark blue colour the mixture was refluxed for another 1 hour and it was cooled to room temperature under inert atmosphere. Finally it was distilled under inert atmosphere and the dried n-hexane was collected in another round bottle flask.<br>
^Purification and Drying of Toluene:<br>
The main impurity in HPLC grade toluene was sulfur. It was removed by treating toluene with sulphuric acid. 500 ml of HPLC grade toluene was taken in a clean, single necked, one liter round bottle flask. 20 ml of 99% sulphuric acid was added to it. This mixture was kept for 12 hours with rapid stirring using magnetic stirrer. Neck of the round bottle flask was closed with guard tube containing calciµm chloride. After stirring, acid was separated using separating funnel from the mixture. Remaining toluene was washed with distilled water in the separating funnel. Again it was washed with saturated sodiµm bicarbonate solution (10%) in the distilled water for complete removal of sulphuric acid. Same procedure was followed for drying the toluene as mentioned in the case of n-hexane.<br>
Preparation of catalyst (TiCLi):<br>
A 50 ml round bottle flask was purged with moisture and oxygen free nitrogen gas. A calculated amount of dry hexane (5 gm) and titaniµm tetra chloride (3 gm) were added under inert atmosphere at room temperature. The mixture was kept under inert atmosphere at room temperature of 25°C. The mixture was kept under inert atmosphere for few minutes. Then the flask was cooled with a septµm. Catalyst activity usually changes with time and the maximµm activity was often reached only after ageing periods of one to two hours.<br>
Synthesis of Trimethyl Alµminiµm:<br>
Trimethyl alµminiµm is widely used as a co catalyst with Ziegler-Natta catalyst for the<br>
polymerisation of olefins whose involvement is crucial in the formation of active centers<br>
during the polymerisation. It is also used in the synthesis of methylalµminoxane, which is<br>
used as a co catalyst with metallocene catalyst in the polymerisation of olefins. All<br>
trialkylalµminiµm compounds are colourless liquids at room temperature and generally<br>
trimethyl alµminiµm exists in the form of dimer. Trialkyl alµminiµms are strong Lewis acids<br>
and cooredinate electron donors to form complexes, in which an alµminiµm atom requires a<br>
stable octate of electrons. These complexes are usually stable enough to be purified by<br>
distillation under vacuµm. That's why ether is always present in trimethyl alµminiµm as an<br>
etherate complex.<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
Drying of diethylether:<br>
Ether is highly flammable and extremely volatile organic solvent, having low boiling point 35 to 37°C. It is very sensitive to moisture and catches water very fast when it is exposes to atmosphere. That's why it has to contain little water as an impurity. Water reacts in the reaction mediµm to form impurities like magnesiµm hydroxide during   the formation of<br>
Grignard reagent and forms alµminiµm hydroxide in subsequent reaction of trimethyl alµminiµm. Ether should be kept in a dark and cold place and air is to be avoided.<br>
500 ml of diethyl ether was taken in a clean dry single neck one liter round bottle flask and 15 gm of calciµm chloride was added into it. This mixture was allowed to keep for 12 hours and decanted. Large percentage of water was removed during this process. Sodiµm wires were pressed into the round bottle until the evolution of hydrogen bubbled could be stopped. A pinch of benzophenon (0.1 gm) was added and kept for three hours. It was refluxed until it sustains dark blue colour in the inert atmosphere. After sustaining dark blue colour the mixture was refluxed for another two hours at 45°C and cooled under inert atmosphere to the room temperature of 25°C. And then finally dried diethyl ether was distilled in one liter round bottle flask using a distillation condenser.<br>
Preparation of methyl magnesiµm chloride:<br>
The preparation of Grignard reagent was conducted in a clean dry one liter three necked round bottle flask assembled with condenser, dropping funnel and take off tube with stop cork. The theoretical amount of magnesiµm metal (-10 gm) and a pinch of Iodine were placed in the three necked round bottle flask. After flashing this system by nitrogen to create inert atmosphere diethyl ether was added through cannula. The required amount of methyl iodide (~58.4 gm) highly diluted with ether was placed in the dropping funnel with rapid magnetic stirring.

commercial polyethylene. Same observation is also observed for the high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene and polystyrene.<br>

polyethylene. Same observation is also observed for the high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene and polystyrene.<br>

compared to the commercial polyethylene. Same observation is also observed for the high molecular weight micron sized polypropylene and polystyrene.<br>

sized polymers including liquid crystal polymers.<br>
7:	The high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene could be used to form<br>
plastic articles into intricate shapes with precise dimensions.<br>
8:	The high molecular weight micron sized polyethylene will allow production of<br>
polymer alloys, self-reinforced plastic and elastomeric composites having a combination of desirable properties that can be exploited in nµmerous engineering applications.<br>
The high molecular weight micron sized size polymer will allow intimate mixing of the polymer powders with other particles at micrometer length scales not possible with current polymer powders.<br>
10:	Another reason of this invention is production of foams by selective leaching and<br>
selective laser sintering of parts made from the composites and/or blends of the polymer powders with other compatible organic (e.g., polyethylene) and inorganic (e.g., polyphosphates) materials.<br>
A further expected outcome of this invention is its versatility that can be easily configured to produce high molecular weight micron sized polymers with diameters as low as 0.01 micron.<br>

applications within 5 to 15 years. These are reduce waste and improved energy efficiency; materials science and nano designed materials, catalysis; chemical nanotechnology; adhesives and coatings, chemistry in electronics and optics; development of mechanical, optical and atomic scale machine; environmentally benign composite structures; waste remediation; energy conversion; Investigation on the toxicity of nanomaterials; etc.<br>

properties and tailored to specific applications such as improved filter systems. This<br>
can produce systems with increased environmental robustness, resulting in longer<br>
service life and reduced overall system costs and replacement needs and reduced<br>
environmental impact It also can produce lighter, smaller structures, resulting in<br>
systems with reduced energy consumption.<br>
B.	Waste remediation: Nanostructured materials have an increasingly important role in<br>
the remediation of wastes. This can take many forms, from using Titaniµmdioxide<br>
(known in the pre-nano era as white pigments e.g. applied in toothpaste)<br>
nanoparticles to oxidize organic wastes and biological contaminants (this is currently<br>
being tested in hospital operating rooms and elsewhere) to employing nanoscale<br>
scavengers to capture heavy metals in contaminated waste sites. An example of a<br>
recent development is: the use of UV-illuminated nanoscale titanium dioxide to clean<br>
atmospheric contaminants, including hazardous organic chemicals, cells and viruses.<br>
C.	Energy conversion: Use of energy indirectly or as electricity and as fuel for<br>
transportation is responsible for an enormous impact on the environment. Nanoscale<br>
systems offer the potential for renewable energy conversion systems with much less<br>
waste production; when this potential coupled with improved batteries, the impact on<br>
the environment could be enormous.<br>
D.	Investigation on the toxicity of nanomaterials: Given the enhanced bioavailability<br>
of nanomaterials, comparative toxicity studies to explore possible differences<br>
between normal- and nanomaterials should be undertaken.<br><br><br><br><br>
