The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
CORROSION-RESISTANT  CLAD  STEEL  PLATE  AND ITSMANUFACTURING METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to a corrosion-resistant clad steel plate, in particular, a corrosion-resistant clad steel plate having excellent mechanical bonding force in heterogeneous metals and its manufacturing method.<br>
In contrast to general medal"s, corrosion-resistant materials, such as alloys of titanium (Ti) , zirconium (Zr) , tantalum (Ta) , niobium (Nb) and nickel, are difficult to weld and also very expensive, and thus are not generally used in the industry. However, such metals having corrosion-resistance, light weight, excellent strength may be used in various fields-, though being restricted in their range of uses. In the fields requiring excellent corrosion-resistant materials, such as chemical plants,- environmental facilities and so on, the clad steel plates comprising the corrosion-resistant materials bonded to inexpensive carbon steel plates have been widely used because of their economic benefit, convenience in use, and various utilities. Various clad steel plates are manufactured by several methods. For example,  a hot rolling method is responsible for a roll bond<br>
2<br><br>
clad plate and an explosive welding method for an explosive welded clad plate. Additionally, a resistance seam welding method is useful to manufacture a clad plate.<br>
In a preparation technique of a roll bond clad plate by a hot rolling method, a.corrosion-resistant alloy layer with excellent corrosion resistance comprising nickel alloy or nickel-copper alloy or titanium alloy on a carbon steel plate as a base metal is simultaneously heated, and then hot-rolled at high temperature through a roller. As such,v it is not. a favorable technique from the viewpoint of manufacturing cost.<br>
In contrast to the roll bond clad plate by hot rolling, a technique for forming a clad steel plate by an explosive welding method uses explosion energy of blasting powders for bonding, and thus has somewhat superior bonding force to that of the roll bond. However, this technique has disadvantages of having more expensive manufacturing costs and requiring longer preparation time than the roll bond and limitations of sizes of the clad steel plates, and dangers in the work place associated with explosive powders.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems economically and simply, a method for manufacturing the clad steel plafes by use of a resistance seam welding has been developed. - In this method, metals are welded by use of the heat generated by the electric resistance when a large quantity of current flows in the metals, in accordance with a principle invented by James Joule. There have been proposed attempts to bond heterogeneous metals by such a resistance<br>
3<br><br>
seam welding. For instance, a thin strip or netting of copper alloy and stainless steel as the binder is intercalated into the carbon steel plate and the steel plate of the corrosion-resistant nickel alloy or titanium steel plate and then seara-welded. But this process " suffers from limitations in use because of poor bonding force.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention for alleviating the problems as described above is to provide a clad plate consisting of a corrosion-resistant material and a carbon steel not only being inexpensive but only having excellent bonding force in heterogeneous metals, and its manufacturing method.<br>
The above and other objects, features and other advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a corrosion-resistant clad plate of the present invention to be welded by a resistance welder consisting of two circular electrodes.<br>
FIG. 2 is a sectional perspective view of a clad plate<br>
4<br><br>
of the present invention.<br>
Based on the present invention, the above objects can be achieved by tack-welding a thin strip of Fe- or Ni-based amorphous alloy as a binder onto one side or both sides of a carbon steel plate and seam-welding a corrosion-resistant metal plate"such as an alloy of nickel or titanium onto the binder to produce a corrosion-resistant clad steel plate.<br>
Alternatively, a corrosion-resistant ciad steel plate can be produced by tack-welding a thin strip of Fe- or Ni-based amorphous alloy as a first binder onto one side or both sides of a carbon steel plate, tack-weiding a thin strip of an alloy of nickel or stainless steel and copper as a second binder onto the thin strip and seam-welding a corrosion-resistant metal plate such as an alloy of nickel or titanium onto the binder.<br>
The thin strip of Fe- or Ni-based amorphous alloy is used as the binder of a middle layer between the corrosion-resistant material and the base metal (usually, carbon steel). Accordingly, heterogeneous metals can be bonded together by virtue of characteristics of the amorphous alloy, while clad steel plate with excellent bonding force can be manufactured.<br>
The reason why the Fe- or Ni-based amorphous alloy is used as a first binder is that, because the Fe- or Ni-based<br>
5<br><br>
amorphous "alloy is deficient in a slip system, which is usually found in structural crystals, but retains a free volume resulting from random atom arrangement, it is of high strength with high ductility as well as showing such high electric resistance as to generate great heat upon seam welding, a kind of resistance welding, thereby bringing about excellent bonding force.<br>
Commonly,  Fe- or Ni-based amorphous thin strip has higher electric resistance and better ductility and fluidity than those of general materials so that, when conducting resistance  seam  welding,  it  may  be  bonded,  with  no dependence on shape of materials or forms of their surfaces. Also, because the Fe- or Ni-based amorphous thin strip is unstable at normal temperatures but crystallizes at about 300-500 °C, when seam-welded at about 1000 °C or higher, its welded portions form stable structures, thereby forming a clad plate  with  superior bonding  force  and mechanical strength.<br>
Alternatively, in order to obtain a clad steel plate having better bonding force and mechanical strength, a second binder with high strength, including nickel or stainless steel, may be laminated onto the first binder at the same time, and then! seam welded to manufacture clad steel plates comprising heterogeneous metals with high strength.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the" clad ..steel plate of the present invention is manufactured by laminating a thin<br>
6<br><br>
nickel strip 3, as the second binder, onto the amorphous thin strip 2, as the first binder, interposing the laminated layer between the corrosion-resistant metal plate 4 and the base metal 1, and then seam-welding via circular electrodes 5. The method of the present invention has far superior bonding force to that .of conventional methods in which only a thin strip of nickel alloy is seam-welded, or wire netting, copper netting, stainless netting and the like are laminated onto the nickel alloy thin strip before conducting the seam welding. As such, the best seam-welding, may be carried out, with suitable control of pressing pressure, current and period of time in accordance with- kinds- and thickness of the corrosion-resistant materials, the binders and the carbon steel materials.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 2, there is shown a clad steel plate comprising the corrosion-resistant metal plate 4 bonded to the base metal 1 or the base metal 1 between the corrosion-resistant metal plates 4, in which ,seam-welded beads 6 are provided on surfaces of the clad steel plate.<br>
In addition to bonding the corrosion-resistant materials, such as titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), tantalum (Ta) , niobium (Nb) and nickel, to the carbon steel, the corrosion-resistant materials can be bonded with stainless steel or copper, aluminum and so on. Further, other heterogeneous materials including nickel alloy and carbon steel, copper alloy and carbon steel, etc., may be bonded.<br>
When the amorphous Fe- or Ni-based thin strip is used,<br>
7<br><br>
we expect to improve the ease of welding by making use of the thin strip further comprising elements such as boron (B) or silicon (Si), other than iron (Fe), and thus to increase the bonding strength. Additionally, to improve the bonding force and the mechanical strength of the clad steel plate, a plural number of layers of the first binder and the second binder may be used to conduct the seam welding, and flux may be also applied on the binders to increase various effects when being welded.<br>
A better understanding of the present invention may be obtained in light of the following examples which are set forth to illustrate, but are hot to he construed to limit the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Layers of binders were interposed between a carbon steel (SS400) 6 mm thick as a base metal and-titanium 1.6 mm thick as a corrosion-resistant material. They were bonded by a resistance welder under conditions of 2 kg/mm2 of a pressing pressure, 15000-40000A of a welding current, 5-10 hours of resistance welding time and 5-10 hours of down time, to obtain a clad steel plate. The mechanical strengths of titanium clad steel plates manufactured through a method of the present invention and conventional ones are presented in Table 1, below. In Table 1, it is found that products of the present invention have superior shear strength to that<br>
