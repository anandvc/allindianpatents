TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the chemical processing of wood pulps to reduce resin<br>
content. More particularly, this invention is the use of alkyl alcohol alkoxylate<br>
surfactants in kraft and sulfite cooking processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the pulping process, delignification is the primary reaction that allows wood<br>
fibers to be separated from one another. Various mechanical and chemical methods are<br>
used to effect this separation, but the most widely used technique is known as kraft or<br>
sulfite process, since it produces pulp which gives high strength and good aging<br>
properties to paper products.<br>
In the kraft process, a cooking liquor (white liquor) of sodium hydroxide and<br>
sodium sulfite is used to extract the lignin from wood. The process of extraction or<br>
delignification is carried out in digesters, either batch or continuous. The pH in the<br>
digester is generally between about 11 and about 14.<br>
The liquor temperature is maintained between about 150 to about 175 ° C. A<br>
period of from about 2 to about 3 hours is usually required for complete digestion. The<br>
pulp is then washed before being further treatment such as bleaching prior to<br>
manufacture of paper products.<br>
Cooking liquor penetration of wood chips is vital to the success of the pulping<br>
process. Pulp uniformity correlates directly with the ease of paper manufacturing<br>
operations and quality of end products. Adequate movement of cooking liquor into the<br>
wood is an essential first step in the pulping process. Removal of sufficient lignin for<br>
fiber liberation requires the penetration and diffusion of pulping liquor into the chip and<br>
then uniform distribution throughout the wood.<br><br>
The two mechanisms that transport cooking chemicals into wood are<br>
penetration and diffusion. Penetration is the flow of cooking liquor into wood pores,<br>
while diffusion is the transport of dissolved chemicals as a result of a concentration<br>
gradient.<br>
In kraft digesters, nonuniformity results from different wood species, chip size,<br>
chip age, errors in determining chip moisture content and pulping conditions. If the<br>
chips are too thick, a less homogenous pulp is produced because the alkali in the chip is<br>
consumed faster than it can be replaced by diffusion. Thus, the outer fibers are<br>
extensively delignified before the inner core has had an opportunity to react. The<br>
thickness of chips is always variable on a commercial scale. Deficient penetration<br>
during cooking results in higher screen rejects and shives in the final pulp, a high lignin<br>
content at a given yield, and inferior bleachability and end-use properties.<br>
Nonuniform pulping can also occur in chips due to the interference of resin<br>
content. The resin in wood is primarily located in the parenchyma cells and lumen.<br>
The intact cell walls effectively protect the resin from contact with cooking chemicals.<br>
Digestion and deresination can be considered to occur in the following manner:<br>
1)	Wetting of wood chips and resin by an aqueous alkaline fluid;<br>
2)	Penetration of the wood chips by this fluid;<br>
3)	Break-up resin and fatty acid aggregates and defibering of the wood chips<br>
promoted by invasion of aqueous alkaline fluid into the chip flow channels; and<br>
4)	Stabilizing dispersed resin particles thus reducing their redeposition onto<br>
cellulose fibers.<br>
Surfactants can aid the above steps of the process through different mechanisms<br>
such as wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing these resinous materials into and out of<br>
wood structure. This results in a lower pulp resin content after cooking and washing<br>
stages. For dissolving grade pulps, it is necessary to reduce the pulp resin content to<br>
very low levels to prevent adverse effects of resin on acetate and viscose properties. In<br>
papermaking pulps, these extractives, when liberated during the processing of the wood<br><br>
chips to pulp and paper products, can cause troublesome pitch deposits on mill<br>
equipment, press picking and off quality production. Hence, effective pulp deresination<br>
aids can be useful in the manufacture of paper pulps as well as dissolving pulps.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,728,265 discloses the use of alkoxylated branched and<br>
unbranched aliphatic alcohols having 3 to 22 carbon atoms as chip penetrants.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is a method of reducing the resin content of chemical pulps<br>
comprising heating wood chips in an aqueous alkaline medium in the presence of an<br>
effective deresinating amount of an alkyl alcohol alkoxylate of formula<br>
RO[(CH2CHCH3O)x(CH2CH2O)y]M wherein R is C4 to C40 alkyl; x is 1-50; y is 0-100<br>
and M is H or an alkali metal.<br>
In another aspect, this invention is a cooking liquor comprising sodium<br>
hydroxide and sodium sulfite and an alkyl alcohol alkoxylate of formula<br>
RO[(CH2CHCH3O)x(CH2CH2O)y]M wherein R is C4 to C40 alkyl; x is 1-50; y is 0-100<br>
and M is H or an alkali metal.<br>
In another aspect, this invention is a deresinated pulp prepared by heating wood<br>
chips in an aqueous alkaline medium in the presence of an effective deresinating<br>
amount of an alkyl alcohol alkoxylate of formula RO[(CH2CHCH3O)x(CH2CH2O)y]M<br>
wherein R is C4 to C40 alkyl; x is 1-50; y is 0-100 and M is H or an alkali metal.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
"Alkyl alcohol" means compound or mixture of compounds of formula ROH<br>
where R is a straight or branched C4-C40 alkyl group.<br>
"Hydroxide base" means the hydroxide (OH) salts of alkali metals such as<br>
sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium lithium, and the like.<br>
"White liquor" means an aqueous mixture of alkali metal hydroxide and a<br>
sulfite with or without further additives and in concentrations well known in the art.<br>
The Kappa number, which is directly proportional to the amount of lignin remaining in<br><br>
the pulp, is the volume (in milliliters) of 0.1 N potassium permanganate solution<br>
consumed by one gram of moisture-free pulp under the conditions specified in TAPPI<br>
method T 236 cm-85.<br>
The alkyl alcohol alkoxylates of this invention have formula<br>
RO[(CH2CHCH3O)x(CH2CH2O)y]M wherein R is C4 to C40 alkyl; x is 1-50; y is 0-50<br>
and M is H or an alkali metal.<br>
The alkyl alcohol alkoxylates are prepared by heating a C4-C40 alkyl alcohol, or<br>
mixture of C4-C40 alkyl alcohols, both designated herein as ROH, with propylene oxide,<br>
and optionally ethylene oxide in the presence of a hydroxide base. Preferably the<br>
reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 150 °C in a pressure vessel at a pressure<br>
of about 50 to about 75 psi. The resulting alkoxylate may be either left in salt form or<br>
neutralized with acid.<br>
The ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may be added in random or block<br>
fashion. "Block polymer" means the polymer resulting from block addition of the<br>
propylene oxide and ethylene oxide. "Hetero polymer" means the polymer resulting<br>
from random addition of the propylene oxide and ethylene oxide.<br>
Random addition of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide involves both<br>
components being added to the alcohol simultaneously, such that the rate of addition to<br>
the alcohol is controlled by their relative amounts and reaction rates. Thus, in the case<br>
of random addition, it is understood the above formula is not a structural formula but<br>
rather is representative only of the molar amounts, x and y, of ethylene oxide and<br>
propylene oxide that are added to the alcohol ROH.<br>
In the case of block addition, either the ethylene oxide or propylene oxide is<br>
added first to the alcohol and allowed to react. The other component is then added and<br>
allowed to react. In the case of block addition, the above formula is representative of<br>
the structure of the alkoxylated alcohol, except that the (C2H4O)X and (C3H6O)y groups<br>
may be reversed depending on whether the propylene oxide or ethylene oxide is added<br>
first. The resulting polymer is a highly water soluble solid.<br>
In a preferred aspect of this invention, M is H.<br><br>
In another preferred aspect, M is K.<br>
In another preferred aspect, R is C8-C22 alkyl.<br>
In another preferred aspect, R is C16 alkyl.<br>
In another preferred aspect, x is 1-20.<br>
In another preferred aspect y is 20-80.<br>
In another preferred aspect, x is 1-20, y is 20-80 and X is H.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the alkyl alcohol alkoxylate is a block polymer.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the alkyl alcohol alkoxylate is a hetero polymer.<br>
The method of this invention comprises contacting wood chips and the like with<br>
a digester aid which is a liquid mixture comprised of white liquor containing at least<br>
one alkyl alcohol alkoxylate surfactant as described herein to obtain pulp for producing<br>
paper. The surfactant concentration in the white liquor and the contact time with the<br>
pulp chips are each adjusted such that resinous components are extracted from the pulp<br>
without substantial degradation of cellulose. After contacting at least a portion of the<br>
wood chips with the digester aid, the combination is heated to a digestion temperature<br>
typically above about 150 °C. The heating is also referred to as cooking.<br>
The alkyl alcohol alkoxylate surfactant is preferably diluted with water and<br>
added as an aqueous solution to the white liquor after the liquor is diluted to a strength<br>
appropriate for the Kraft cook. The aqueous alkyl alcohol surfactant composition can<br>
also be added to a mixture of white and black liquor or black liquor only, or it can be<br>
used in treating the wood chips prior to adding the wood chips to the cooking liquor.<br>
After the wood has been digested to form a pulp slurry according to the present<br>
invention, and washed to remove the inorganics and dissolved organics, the pulp slurry<br>
is then provided to a papermaking machine. Paper may then be produced from the pulp<br>
slurry according to known procedures of papermaking. Although the specific<br>
percentages and process parameters described herein are preferred, other percentages<br>
and parameters may be utilized.<br><br>
In a preferred aspect, the cooking is done at a temperature of about 150 °C to<br>
about 175 °C.<br>
In another preferred aspect, the cooking is done in the presence of about 0.5 to<br>
about 2 pounds per ton of alkyl alcohol alkoxylate on an oven dried chip basis.<br>
The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following examples,<br>
which are presented for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope<br>
of this invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Pulping Studies<br>
Pulping studies are carried out in a Lorentzen &amp; Wettre autoclave digester<br>
consisting of eight autoclaves (0.5 liter each) rotating in a heated glycol bath. In these<br>
experiments, a known amount of kraft cooking liquor (sodium hydroxide and sodium<br>
sulfite) is added into the wood chips to achieve the desired degree of pulp<br>
delignification. A 5% stock solution of each alkyl alcohol alkoxylate surfactant is<br>
prepared in a 100 ml volumetric flask. The surfactant charge is tested at a constant<br>
charge of 0.05% (o.d. chips). The surfactant solution is added to the kraft cooking<br>
liquor and thoroughly mixed before transferring into the autoclaves. A control<br>
experiment is also run simultaneously in each set.<br>
Each of the autoclaves is charged with the wood chips and liquor, sealed and<br>
placed in the oil bath. The initial temperature of the oil bath is 50 °C. The temperature<br>
is then ramped up and held at 170 °C for 1-3 hours to obtain the desired level of<br>
delignification. During the cook, the autoclaves rotate end-over-end to facilitate<br>
mixing and uniform heat transfer.<br>
At the conclusion of the cook, the autoclaves are removed from the oil bath and<br>
the reaction is quenched by cooling the autoclaves to 40 °C for 10 minutes. The<br>
contents of the autoclaves are then disintegrated in a Waring blender for 2 minutes.<br>
The resulting pulp is extensively washed over a cheese cloth in a Buchner funnel and<br>
screened on a Voith flat screen with 0.20 mm slots. After screening, the rejects (un<br><br>
cooked material), kappa number (amount of residual lignin in the pulp), deresination<br>
(residual extractives in the pulp) and black liquor residual active alkali are determined.<br>
The resin content of the chemical pulp is significantly reduced (65-70%<br>
deresination) when cooked in the presence of the alkyl alcohol alkoxylate surfactant of<br>
this invention. Furthermore, compared with other chemistries used commercially for<br>
deresination, the alkyl alcohol alkoxylate surfactant provides up to three fold higher<br>
deresination efficiency, resulting in improved deresination at substantially lower<br>
additive levels (0.5-1 lb/ton of pulp) compared to the currently used conventional<br>
chemistries (2-3 lb/ton of pulp).<br>
Although this invention has been described in detail for the purpose of<br>
illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that<br>
numerous modifications, alterations and changes can be made therein by those skilled<br>
in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention except as it may<br>
be limited by the claims. All changes which come within the meaning and range of<br>
equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. <br><br>
