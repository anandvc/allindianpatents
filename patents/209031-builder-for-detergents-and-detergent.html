 The organic amine salts of the polymer can be synthesized by neutralizing the polymer with the -. organic amine. The neutralization can be carried out in a solution using a solvent. Examples of the solvent include water, alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropylalcohol, etc.), ketones (acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, etc.), ethers (diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, etc.), aliphatic hydrocarbons (hexane, heptane, etc.), aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene, xylene, etc.), and their mixtures. When a nonionic surfactant (B) is used, the nonionic surfactant (B) may be mixed after neutralizing the polymer with the organic amine. Alternatively, the nonionic surfactant (B) may also be mixed with the polymer, followed by neutralization with the organic amine. The neutralization degree is usually 30 to 100%, preferably 60 to 100%. The quarternary ammonium salts of the polymer can be prepared by conventional methods such as one in which a tertiary amine is reacted with an alkyl halide or aryl halide (for example, halides having 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as methyl chloride, ethyl bromide and bromobenzene) to form a quaternary ammonium halide, subsequently the resulting halide is reacted with an alkali hydroxide (for example, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide) to afford a quaternary ammonium salt hydroxide, and finally the polymer is neutralized with the resulting hydroxide; and one in which a tertiary amine is reacted with a dialkyl (the carbon number: 1 to 6) carbonate (for example, dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate) to form a quaternary ammonium carbonate, with which the polymer is then anion exchanged. The neutralization or anion exchange can be carried out in a solution using a solvent similar to one used for the neutralization of the organic amine.Furthermore, when a nonionic surfactant is used, it may be mixed either before or after the neutralization or-anion exchanger<br>
 concrete example of a method for anion exchanging the polymer with the quaternary ammonium carbonate is as follows. For example, in the case of a salt of polyacrylic acid and trimethyloctylammonium, 1 mole of dimethyloctylamine, lmole or more of dimethyl carbonate and methanol are charged into a pressure vessel and a reaction is carried out at an elevated pressure of about 5 kg/cm2 at about 120°C to obtain a methanol solution of trimethyloctylammonium      carbonate.      Subsequently,      the      methanol      solution      of<br><br><br>
trimethyloctylammonium carbonate is added slowly to an aqueous solution of polyacrylic acid at 80 to 90°C. Evaporation of the generating carbon dioxide and methanol affords an aqueous solution of a trimethyloctylammonium salt of polyacrylic acid.<br>
The degree of the neutralization or anion exchange is usually 30 to 100%, preferably 60 to 100%.<br>
The solubility parameter (hereinafter, referred to as SP value) of the organic amine salts or quaternary ammonium salts (A) of the polymer is usually 8.0 to 12.0, preferably 8.5 to 11.5, in view of their solubility to detergents. When it ranges from 8.0 to 12.0, detergency becomes better and dissolution stability of the salts in detergents becomes better. The SP value can be representedby the general formula (6): a general formula       8 = (AH/V)1/2 (6)<br>
wherein in the formula (6), 5 is a SP value, A H is a molar heat of vaporization (cal), and V is a molar volume (cm ).<br>
The SP value can be calculated from the sum (AH) of the molar heat of vaporization (Aei ) of      atomic groups and the sum (V) of the molar volume (ΔV1 ) of the atomic groups described in "POLYMER ENGINEERING AND FEBRUARY, 1974, Vol. 14, No. 2, ROBERS F. FEDORS, (pp,151-153)".<br>

Table 4<br><br><br>
Table 5<br><br><br><br><br><detergency test><br>
An artificial soiled cloth (a knitted cotton) was washed for 10 minutes under the following conditions, that is a~volume of water of 50 L,a bath ratio of 30, an amount of detergent used of 25 g and a water temperature of 25°C, and subsequently rinsed for 3 minutes twice using a centrifugal-washer, NA-F800P, manufactured by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. Dejsfgency was calculated from the following formula and evaluated.<br>
Detergency (% ) = {(Rw -Rs) / (Rt -Rs)} X 100<br>
Rl is a reflectance of an unsoiled cloth, Rw is a reflectance of a washed cloth and Rs is a reflectance of a soiled cloth. The reflectances at 540 nm were determined using a multi-light source spectrophotometric colorimeter manufactured by Suga Test Instruments. The artificial soiled cloth used is a wet artificial soiled cloth with the soil composition shown in Table 9 available from The Society of Laundry Science having a reflectance at 540 nm of 40 ± 5%.<br>
