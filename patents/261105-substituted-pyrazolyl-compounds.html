				<td>CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrazole derivatives, their pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use. In addition, the present invention relates to therapeutic methods for the treatment and prevention of cancers and to the use of these pyrazole derivatives in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the treatment and prevention of cancers. Background of the invention<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK's) are a sub-family of protein kinases that play a critical role in cell signalling and are involved in a variety of cancer related processes including cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. Currently up to 100 different RTK's including tropomyosin-related kinases (Trk's) have been identified.<br>
Trk's are the high affinity receptors activated by a group of soluble growth factors called neurotrophins (NT). The Trk receptor family has three members - TrkA, TrkB and TrkC. Among the NTs there are (i) nerve growth factor (NGF) which activates TrkA, (ii) brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) and NT-4/5 which activate TrkB and (iii) NT3 which activates TrkC. Each Trk receptor contains an extra-cellular domain (ligand binding), a trans-membrane region and an intra-cellular domain (including kinase domain). Upon binding of the ligand, the kinase catalyzes auto-phosphorylation and triggers downstream signal transduction pathways.<br>
Trk's are widely expressed in neuronal tissue during its development where Trk's are critical for the maintenance apd survival of these cells. A post-embryonic role for the Trk/neurotrophin axis (or pathway), however, remains in question. There are reports showing that Trk's play important role in both development and function of the nervous system (Patapoutian, A. et al Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 2001, 11, 272-280).<br>
In the past decade, a considerable number of literature documentations linking Trk signalling with cancer have published. For example, while Trk's are expressed at low levels outside the nervous system in the adult, Trk expression is increased in late stage prostate cancers. Both normal prostate tissue and androgen- dependent prostate tumours express low levels of Trk A and undetectable levels of Trk B and C. However, all isoforms of Trk receptors as well as their cognate ligands are up-regulated in late stage, androgen-independent prostate cancer. There is additional evidence that these late stage prostate cancer<br>
cells become dependent on the Trk/neurotrophin axis for their survival. Therefore, Trk inhibitors may yield a class of apoptosis-inducing agents specific for androgen- independent prostate cancer (Weeraratna, A. T, et al The Prostate, 2000, 45, 140-148).<br>
Furthermore, very recent literature also shows that over-expression, activation, amplification and/or mutation of Trk's are associated with secretory breast carcinoma (Cancer Cell, 2002, 2, 367-376), colorectal cancer (Bardelli et al Science, 2003, 300, 949-949) and ovarian cancer (Davidson, B. et al Clinical Cancer Research, 2003, 9, 2248-2259).<br>
There are a few reports of selective Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cephalon described CEP-751, CEP-701 (George, D. et al Cancer Research, 1999, 59, 2395-2341) and other indolocarbazole analogues (WOO 1 14380) as Trk inhibitors, It was shown that CEP-701 and/or CEP751, when combined with surgically or chemically induced androgen ablation, offered better efficacy compared with mono-therapy alone. GlaxoSmithKline disclosed certain oxindole compounds as Trk A inhibitors in W00220479 and WO0220513. Recently, Japan Tobacco reported pyrazolyl condensed cyclic compounds as Trk inhibitors (JP2003231687A).<br>
In addition to the above, Vertex Pharmaceuticals have' described pyrazole compounds<br>
as inhibitors of GSK3, Aurora, etc. in W00250065, WO0262789,W0030271 11 and<br>
W0200437814; and AstraZeneca have reported pyrazole compounds as inhibitors against<br>
IGF-1 receptor kinase (WO0348 133).<br>

Certain intermediates disclosed herein are novel as such they are provided as a further feature of the invention.<br>
It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.        ,<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an<br>
-aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate), A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a /'-butyl group which may  the removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art. Definitions<br>

Utility	The compounds of the present invention have utility for the treatment of cancer by inhibiting the tyrosine kinases, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B. Methods of treatment target tyrosine kinase activity, particularly the Trk activity and more particularly Trk A and B activity, which is involved in a variety of cancer related processes. Thus, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B, are expected to be active against neoplastic disease such as carcinoma of the breast, ovary, lung, colon, prostate or other tissues, as well as leukemias and lymphomas, tumours of the central and peripheral nervous system, and other tumour types such as melanoma, fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly the Trk inhibitors and more particularly Trk A and B inhibitors are also expected to be useful for the treatment other proliferative diseases including but not limited to autoimmune, inflammatory, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the invention are expected to be of value in the treatment or prophylaxis of cancers selected with up regulated of constitutively activated Trk kinases, including but not limited to, oncogenic rearrangements leading to ETV6-TrkC fusions, TRP-TrkA fusions proteins, AML-ETO (t8;21), autocrine or paracrine signalling<br>
leading to elevated serum levels of NGF, BDNF, neurotropins or tumours with constitutively<br>
active Trk associated with disease aggressiveness, tumour growth and proliferation or survival<br>
signalling.<br>
Compounds of the present invention have been shown to inhibit tyrosine kinases, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B, as determined by the Trk A Assay described herein.<br>
Compounds provided by this invention should also be useful as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit tyrosine kinases, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B. These would be provided in commercial kits comprising a compound of this invention Trk A Assay Format<br>
Trk A kinase activity was measured for its ability to phosphorylate synthetic tyrosine residues within a generic polypeptide substrate using an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Assay (Alphascreen) technology (PerkinElmer, 549 Albany Street, Boston, MA).<br>
To measure Trk A kinase activity, the intracellular domain of a HIS-tagged human Trk A kinase (amino acids 442-796 of Trk A, Swiss-Prot Primary Accession Number P04629) was expressed in SF9 cells and purified using standard nickel column chromatography. After incubation of the kinase with a biotinylated substrate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for 20 minutes at room temperature, the kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The reaction was performed in 384 wellinicrotitre plates and the reaction products were detected with the addition of strepavidin coated Donor Beads and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies coated Acceptor Beads using the EnVisign Multilabel Plate Reader aftee An overnight incubation at room temperature.Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the formula (I) vary with structural change, in general activity possessed by compounds of the formula (I) may be demonstrated at IC50 concentrations (concentrations to achieve 50% inhibition) or doses in the range of (0.01 µM to 10 µM).<br>
When tested in the above in-vitro assay the Trk inhibitory activity of the following examples was measured at the following IC50s.<br>
