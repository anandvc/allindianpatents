[0139]   After alluvial soil was placed in a styrol cup of 1/30000 are, water was poured<br>
therein and mixed, and adjusted to a submerged condition of water depth 4 cm.<br>
After seeds of Echinochloa crus-galli, Scirpus juncoides and Monochoria vaginalis<br>
were sown in the cup, rice seedlings at 2.5th leaf stage were transplanted.   On the<br>
day when the seeds were sown, the wettable powder of the present invention<br>
prepared according to Formulation Example 1 was diluted with water so as to give a<br>
predetermined formulation amount, and the surface of the water was treated with the<br>
diluted wettable powder.   The plants were grown by putting the cup in a green house<br>
at 25 to 30°C, and investigated on herbicidal effect against each weed 3 weeks after<br>
treatment with the herbicide according to the following criteria.   The results are<br>
shown in Table 3.<br>
[0140]   Criteria<br>
5      Herbicidal rate 90% or more (almost complete death)<br>
4      Herbicidal rate 70% or more and less than 90%<br>
3      Herbicidal rate 40% or more and less than 70%<br>
2      Herbicidal rate 20% or more and less than 40%<br>
1      Herbicidal rate 5% or more and less than 20%<br>
0      Herbicidal rate 5% or less (little effect)<br>
Test Example 2: Herbicidal effect test in submerged condition by treatment during weed-growth stage (1)<br>
[0141]   After alluvial soil was placed in a styrol cup of 1/30000 are, water was poured therein and mixed, and adjusted to a submerged condition of water depth 4 cm. After seeds of Echinochloa crus-galli, Scirpus juncoides and Monochoria vaginalis were sown in the cup, the plants were grown by putting the cup in a green house at 25 to 30°C.   When Echinochloa crus-galli, Scirpus juncoides and Monochoria vaginalis reached 1st to 2nd leaf stage, the wettable powder of the present invention prepared according to Formulation Example 1 was diluted with water so as to give a predetermined formulation amount, and the surface of the water was treated with the diluted wettable powder.   The herbicidal effect for each plant was investigated 3 weeks after treatment with the herbicide according to the criteria indicated in Test Example 1.   The results are shown in Table 4. Test Example 3: Herbicidal effect test by soil treatment<br>
[0142]   Sterilized diluvial soil was placed in a plastic box having a size of length 21 cm, width 13 cm and depth 7 cm, seeds Echinochloa crus-galli, Digitaria adscendes, Setaria viridis, Avena fatua, Black-grass, Abutilon avicennae, Ambrosia elatior, Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium album, Polygonum blumei, Stellaria media, Zea mays (corn), Glycine max (soybean), Oryza sativa (rice), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Beta vulgaris (beat) were sown interspatially, covered with about 1.5 cm of soil, and then the wettable powder of the present invention prepared according to Formulation Example 1 was diluted with water so as to give a predetermined formulation amount, and the surface of the soil was uniformly treated with the diluted wettable powder by use of a small-sized spray.   The herbicidal effect for each plant was investigated 3 weeks after treatment with the herbicide according to the criteria indicated in Test Example 1.   The results are shown in Table 5. Test Example 4: Herbicidal effect test by foliage treatment<br>
[0143]   Sterilized diluvial soil was placed in a plastic box having a size of length 21 cm, width 13 cm and depth 7 cm, seeds of Echinochloa crus-galli, Digitaria adscendes, Setaria viridis, Avena fatua, Black-grass, Abutilon avicennae, Ambrosia elatior, Amaranthus retroflexus, Chenopodium album, Polygonum blumei, Stellaria media, Zea mays, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum and Beta vulgaris were sown interspatially, covered with about 1.5 cm of soil, and then the plants were grown by putting the box in a green house at 25 to 30°C.   After growth of 14 days, the wettable powder of the present invention prepared according to Formulation Example<br>
1 was diluted with water so as to give a predetermined formulation amount, and the foliage part was uniformly treated with the diluted wettable powder by use of a small-sized spray.   The herbicidal effect for each plant was investigated 3 weeks after treatment with the herbicide according to the criteria indicated in Test Example 1. The results are shown in Table 6.<br>
Test Example 5: Herbicidal effect test in submerged condition by treatment before weed-generation (2)<br>
[0144]   Paddy surface soil was placed in a plastic pot of 1/10000 are, water was poured therein and mixed.   After seeds of Scirpus juncoides were sown, paddy surface soil was added by 2cm, and submerged with water, and then seeds of Echinochloa crus-galli, Scirpus juncoides, Monochoria vaginalis, Rotala indica and Lindernia pyxidaria were sown together.    In addition, rice seedlings at 2.5th leaf stage were transplanted, and fixed to the paddy surface in a state where the roots were exposed on the other side.   On the day when the seeds were sown, the wettable powder of the present invention prepared according to Formulation Example 1 was diluted with water so as to give a predetermined formulation amount, and the surface of the water was treated with the diluted wettable powder.   The plants were grown by putting the pot in a green house at 25 to 30°C.   The herbicidal effect for each plant was investigated 3 weeks after treatment with the herbicide according to the criteria indicated in Test Example 1.   The results are shown in Table 7. Test Example 6: Crop injury test on rice in water leakage condition [0145]   A mixed soil of alluvial soil and diluvial soil was placed in a plastic pot perforated at the bottom of 1/10000 are, water was poured therein and mixed, and then rice seedlings at 2.5th leaf stage were transplanted.   Water leakage treatment was carried out by placing the pot in a plastic vat, and controlling the amount of water in the vat kept at a condition of 2 cm/day x 3 days.   The pot was put in a green house at 25 to 30°C, on third day after transplantation, the wettable powder of the present invention prepared according to Formulation Example 1 was diluted with water so as to give a predetermined formulation amount, and the surface of the water was treated with the diluted wettable powder.
