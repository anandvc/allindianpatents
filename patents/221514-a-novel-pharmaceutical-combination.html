ORIGINAL<br>

Technical Field:<br>
The present invention is concerned with pharmaceutical combinations comprising agents such as P-2 adrenoreceptor agonists and antihistamines. In particular, the present invention is concerned with pharmaceutical compositions comprising B-2 adrenoreceptor agonists and antihistamines, useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory diseases, and a process of preparing the same.<br>
Background:<br>
Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disorders are the most common chronic diseases worldwide. These represent an enormous and growing therapeutic market and there is therefore an opportunity for development of new drugs. Asthma per se is well treated with existing therapies, but there is a need to find better treatment for patients where asthma occurs along with severe allergic side effects.<br>
Treatment of asthma and other related disorders has been known to employ B-2 agonists, also known as P-2 adrenoreceptor agonists. Such P-2 adrenoreceptor agonists are known to provide a bronchodilator effect to patients by acting on the P-2 adrenergic receptors in the airway smooth muscles and the bronchial smooth muscles, resulting in relief from the symptoms of breathlessness. More particularly, P-2 adrenoreceptor agonists have been shown to increase the conductance of potassium channels in airway muscle cells, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and relaxation.<br>
Various prior art documents suggest different dosage forms of such B-2 adrenoreceptor agonists to be employed in treatment of respiratory diseases.<br>
For example, US 6,585,958 claims a pressure-liquefied propellant mixture for aerosols, comprising dinitrogen monoxide and a hydrofluoroalkane, wherein the active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of salbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, fluticasone, budesonide,   ciclesonide,   glycopyrronium,   tiotropium,   cromoglycic   acid,   nedocromil,<br>
2<br><br>
mometasone, sildenafil, beclomethasone, levalbuterol and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives thereof.<br>
US 6,451,289 claims a stable, preservative-free pharmaceutical formulation comprising levalbuterol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; sodium chloride; and having a pH of about 4. The formulation contains less than 0.08% by weight of albuterol aldehyde and less than 1 ppm dissolved oxygen, and continues to contain less than 0.08% by weight of albuterol aldehyde after storage at 40°C for six months. The formulation does not contain a chelating agent, a sequestering agent, an antioxidant, a preservative agent or an antioxidant. Another article, as published by Handley, Sepracor Inc., USA, indicates that further to clinical studies it has been shown that the active bronchodilatory isomer, (R)-albuterol (levalbuterol) is more efficacious than the racemic albuterol.<br>
Histamine, acting through H|-receptors, produces smooth muscle contraction, an increase in vascular permeability, and stimulation of parasympathetic nerves, all of which are pathophysiological features of asthma. It is also known from the literature that antihistamines may be effective in the treatment of allergic symptoms, for example, they have been seen to possess potent activity in treating seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, the symptoms of allergic asthma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, certain types of physical uricaria, and other disorders benefiting from an inhibiting action on eosinophil function. Examples of antihistamines include H1-receptor antagonists such as cetirizine, levocetirizine and functional derivatives thereof.<br>
Racemic cetirizine is an oral potent, long-acting peripheral antihistamine H1-receptor antagonist and is an example of the second generation of H1-histamine receptor antagonists, which generally offer some significant advantages beyond the first generation compounds. The main advantages associated with the second generation of H1-histamine receptor antagonists are less sedation, little anticholinergic activity and longer duration of therapeutic activity, which increases patient compliance.<br>
Cetirizine is the international non-proprietary name of 2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piprazinyl]   ethoxyacetic   acid.      Cetirizine   as   referred   to   herein   denotes   2-[4-[(4-<br>
3<br><br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-l-piprazinyl] ethoxyacetic acid. The active isomer of cetirizine, levocetirizine, is seen to have more therapeutic activity and lesser side effects of the racemic mixture.<br>
The chemical synthesis of the racemic mixture of cetirizine can be performed by the method described in U.S. Patent 4,525,358 cited above or by an improved procedure disclosed in British application 2,225,320. For example, British application 2,225,321 (Cossement et al.) discloses a method for resolving the 1- [(4-chlorophenyl) phenylmethyl] piperazine precursor using tartaric acid in ethanol. Additionally, the optically pure (-) isomer can be prepared from the racemic mixture by enzymatic biocatalytic resolution as reported in U.S.Patent Nos. 5,057,427 and 5,077,217. EP 0950412 describes various methods and compositions using optically pure (-) cetirizine for treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in humans. WO9406429 and WO9406430 describe the methods and compositions for treating allergic disorders using optically pure (-) cetirizine and optically pure (+) cetirizine respectively. Also US patent no. 6,521,254 describes pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration comprising antihistamine preferably cetirizine and derivatives with decongestant for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Another prior art US 6319927 describes a method for inducing sleep in a human suffering from a sleeping disorder comprising administering to the human a therapeutically effective amount of levocetirizine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof once daily. LU90898 describes methods and compositions comprising levocetirizine for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in humans while avoiding adverse effects associated with the racemic mixture of cetirizine.<br>
LU90870 describes New 2-[4-(diphenylmethyl)-l-piperazinyl]-acetic acids, their amides and their salts, processes for the preparation thereof and therapeutic compositions.<br>
LU870 claims an antihistaminic composition comprising dihydrochloride of 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-l-piperazinyl]ethoxy]-acetic acid (i.e. cetirizine) in unit dosage form of 0.5 to 250 mg. This high dosage range can cause side effects. To avoid this, there is need of a pharmaceutical composition with reduced dosage form and exhibiting high efficacy.<br>
4<br><br>
Despite the large number of known treatments of respiratory diseases, there continues to exist a clinical need for therapies of respiratory diseases which exhibit advantageous profiles of action. To this end, it has now surprisingly been found that a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one therapeutically selective isomer of a p-2-adrenergic agonist, or a salt, solvate, physiologically functional derivative or prodrug thereof, and at least one therapeutically selective isomer of an H1-receptor antagonist, or a salt, solvate, physiologically functional derivative or prodrug thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, provides an enhanced, synergistic therapeutic effect in terms of treatment of respiratory diseases, such as asthma, allergic respiratory disorders and related disorders.<br>
Objectives:<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods of treating asthma, allergic respiratory disorders and related disorders. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising pharmaceutically active agents for the treatment of asthma, allergic respiratory disorders and related disorders.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one therapeutically selective isomer of a B-2-adrenergic agonist, or a salt, solvate, physiologically functional derivative or prodrug thereof, and at least one therapeutically selective isomer of an H|-receptor antagonist, or a salt, solvate, physiologically functional derivative or prodrug thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
Beta-2 adrenoreceptors are known to provide a bronchodilator effect to patients by acting on the [3-2 adrenergic receptors in the airway smooth muscles and the bronchial smooth muscles,<br>
5<br><br>
resulting in relief from the symptoms of breathlessness. .They are thus preferred in the case of asthma treatment which requires the dilation of the bronchial smooth muscles and they relieve the patient of breathlessness associated with asthma. Inclusion of an antihistamine provides for the symptomatic relief of cough including but not limited to that associated with bronchoconstriction and excessive mucous production. The antihistamines suppress the cough reflex, dry excess secretions and in some cases may produce sedation which will assist in the patient"s rest and sleep patterns. Thus the two drugs provide an additive bronchodilatory effect that provides faster relief in an asthmatic attack.<br>
Preferably, the therapeutically selective isomer of the p-2-adrenergic agonist is levalbuterol or its salts, solvates or physiologically functional derivatives thereof. Preferably, the therapeutically selective isomer of an Hi-receptor antagonist is levocetirizine, or its salts, solvates or physiologically functional derivatives thereof.<br>
Albuterol is available as a racemic mixture comprising R and S forms. However, only the R-enantiomer (levalbuterol) is a potent B2 - adrenoreceptor stimulant, whereas the S-enantiomer (dextroalbuterol) shows little or no adrenoreceptor activity. The bronchodilatory property of racemic albuterol is attributable entirely to (R)-albuterol, which has an approximately 100. fold  greater binding affinity for beta2 receptors as compared to (S)-albuterol. In the absence of (R)-albuterol, (S)-albuterol has the potential to induce bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. This divergent pharmacology accentuates the need of levalbuterol over racemic albuterol in the treatment of asthma and other airway diseases.<br>
Levocetirizine is the active R-enantiomcr of cetirizine and represents a new second-generation H|-receptor antagonist. It has a high affinity and selectivity for H1-receptors. Comparative studies have shown evidence of superior H1-receptor binding affinity over its racemate, cetirizine. Levocetirizine exhibits many favourable characteristics of an ideal antihistamine, both pharmacodynamically and pharmacokinetically, including high bioavailability, rapid onset of action, limited distribution and low degree of metabolism. Furthermore, clinical trials indicate that it is safe and effective with a minimal amount of untoward effects.<br>
6<br>
1<br><br>
The salts of levocetirizine refers not only to addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic organic and inorganic acids, such as acetic, citric, maleic, succinic, ascorbic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, and phosphoric acids and the like, but also its metal salts (for example sodium or potassium salts) or ammonium salts, amine salts and amino acid salts. A preferred salt is levocetirizine hydrochloride. The term levocetirizine hydrochloride is employed in a broad sense in the description and claims so as to include levocetirizine hydrochloride as the monohydrochloride and also as the dihydrochloride.<br>
The salts of levalbuterol include levalbuterol sulphate, levalbuterol tartrate and levalbuterol hydrochloride. Preferred salts are levalbuterol sulphate and levalbuterol hydrochloride.<br>
The phrase "therapeutically selective isomer" as described herein includes an isomer of an H1-receptor antagonist or a B-2-adrenergic agonist, which is more potent and shows lesser side effect than the racemic mixture of that compound.<br>
The phrase "respiratory diseases" as described herein can include in particular asthma, allergic respiratory disorders and other such related disorders.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" as used herein denotes a chemical derivative of any of the specific therapeutic agents described herein having the same or similar physiological function as the free base therapeutic agent and, for example, being convertible in the body thereto.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be solid dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, tablets and tablets in capsules, pellets and modified release solid dosage forms, wherein advantageously the antihistamine, preferably levocetirizine is available for immediate release, and theB-2-adrenergic agonist, preferably levalbuterol, is available for extended release. Optionally a part of the P-2-adrenergic agonist can also be made available in the immediate release portion along with the antihistamine. The P-2-adrenergic agonist may preferably be present in a range of about 0.5-5mg, while the anti-histaminic compound may be present in a range of about 5-30mg.<br>
