				<td>Description<br>
Turbine blade for a steam turbine<br>
The invention relates to a turbine blade for a steam turbine,<br>
with an aerofoil section and with a root section, which<br>
aerofoil section contains, at least in regions, a composite<br>
fiber material, the aerofoil section having a filling body<br>
which is arranged in the aerofoil center which is surrounded<br>
completely by the composite fiber material. The invention<br>
relates, furthermore, to a steam turbine having a turbine blade<br>
of this type.<br>
Turbine blades of this type, in particular turbine blades of<br>
this type designed as moving blades, are manufactured in the<br>
prior art from steel or titanium. Turbine blades in general and<br>
particularly end-stage blades are exposed as a consequence of<br>
their function to high centrifugal force stresses, since, to<br>
achieve high efficiency, they should constitute as high a flow-<br>
off surface as possible and consequently must possess a large<br>
blade length. High-strength steels are therefore used for<br>
conventional applications. Where these can no longer be<br>
employed for reasons of centrifugal force stresses, titanium<br>
blades are used, which, because of the lower density, also<br>
experience lower centrifugal force stresses. However, these<br>
blades are substantially more cost-intensive than steel blades.<br>
However, even where titanium blades are concerned, the flow-off<br>
surfaces are limited to approximately 16 m2 for full-revolution<br>
machines (50Hz), thus entailing corresponding consequences for<br>
the blade lengths which can be achieved.<br>
On account of the practical limitation with regard to the blade<br>
length, in the prior art the number of low-pressure streams is<br>
increased in low-pressure stages of steam turbines. This may<br>
take place, for example, by a change from single-stream to two-<br><br>
stream turbine stages or by using a plurality of low-pressure<br>
subturbines. The rotational speed of the turbo set may also be<br>
reduced. In this case, larger flow-off surfaces can then be<br>
utilized. However, all these measures entail sometimes<br>
considerable costs.<br><br>
An object on which the invention is based is to provide a steam<br>
turbine with a turbine blade of the type initially mentioned,<br>
which makes it possible to have a particularly high efficiency<br>
of the steam turbine and at the same time can be operated in<br>
the steam turbine in an operationally reliable way.<br>
EP Al 462 606, US A 3,883,267, US A 5,240,377, FR A 1 178 140<br>
and EP Al 593 811 disclose in each case a turbine blade of the<br>
type initially mentioned. In these blades, the composite fiber<br>
material used or the corresponding layer consisting of it<br>
around the filling body is partially protected against erosion,<br>
but not against penetrating moisture, and this may cause damage<br>
particularly in the wet steam region. Measures for protection<br>
against erosion are also known from EP Al 577 422 and DE 24 50<br>
253 Al. A complete blade consisting of composite fiber material<br>
and having a protective layer applied by electroplating is<br>
already known from DE 22 43 132 Al.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, by means<br>
of a generic turbine blade which has the features of claim 1.<br>
Furthermore, the object is achieved, according to the<br>
invention, by means of a steam turbine according to claim 14.<br>
The subclaims which in each case refer back contain<br>
advantageous developments of the invention.<br>
According to the invention, therefore, composite fiber blades<br>
are used as low-pressure stage or end stage blades. In a<br>
comparison of various materials in terms of strengths, the<br>
advantage of composite fiber materials for use as end stage<br>
blade material is clearly shown. Thus, the strength in relation<br>
to the density (RPo,2/p) is 115 m2/s2 for high-strength tempered<br>
steel, 221 m2/s2 for titanium, but 563 m2/s2 for the fiber-<br>
reinforced material CFK-HM. On account of the substantially<br>
higher strength of the composite fiber material, either turbine<br>
blades manufactured with conventional dimensions can be exposed<br><br>
to higher load or the turbine blades can be produced with a<br>
greater length. The centrifugal force stresses which in this<br>
case arise can then be readily absorbed by the turbine blade,<br>
without any loss of operational reliability, on account of the<br>
substantially increased strength/density ratio.<br>
Owing to the high strength/density ratio of a turbine blade<br>
containing composite fiber material according to the invention,<br>
a greatly enlarged flow-off surface can be provided by the<br>
aerofoil section being designed for use in a low-pressure stage<br>
of the steam turbine in spite of the high centrifugal force<br>
stresses. This may take place, particularly, by the provision<br>
of a particularly great blade length.<br><br>
The efficiency of the steam turbine can consequently be<br>
increased considerably.<br>
In the sector of industrial turbines, for example, the use<br>
according to the invention of the composite fiber material<br>
makes it possible for turbine blade of predetermined dimension<br>
to be exposed to high load by allowing a higher counter<br>
pressure of the end stages (air condensation), by a higher<br>
permissible rotational speed of the drive turbines or by<br>
enlarging the end stage blades for drives of variable<br>
rotational speed. This likewise results in a higher efficiency<br>
of the steam turbine.<br>
As already mentioned, for the sector of power station turbines,<br>
there is the potential for a very considerable lengthening of<br>
existing end stage blades, together with a substantial<br>
enlargement of the flow-off surfaces which can be achieved. For<br>
example, it is been possible hitherto for turbo sets of half-<br>
revolution design and having flow-off surfaces of 20 m2 per<br>
stream to be replaced with the aid of the turbine blades<br>
according to the invention by full-revolution turbo sets of<br>
identical flow-off surface. On account of the smaller overall<br>
size of full-revolution turbo sets, considerable cost saving<br>
becomes possible. Also, by the turbine blades according to the<br>
invention being used, the number of low-pressure streams can be<br>
reduced. The multi-stream power station applications, for<br>
example, one of three lower-pressure parts can be saved. Also,<br>
two-stream lower-pressure turbines can be replaced by single-<br>
stream machines, with the result that considerable cost savings<br>
can likewise be achieved. In addition, by means of the solution<br>
according to the invention, in any event a reduction in the<br>
plant overall size, with the flow-off cross section remaining<br>
the same, can be achieved.<br>
The turbine blade according to the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for the last moving blade row of a steam turbine, but<br><br>
may likewise be used, according to the invention, for the last<br>
but two and, if appropriate, last but three blade row. It may<br>
likewise be combined with preliminary stage blades consisting<br>
of steel or titanium.<br><br>
The aerofoil section containing, according to the invention, at<br>
least in regions, a composite fiber material, of the turbine<br>
blade according to the invention has the composite fiber<br>
material preferably at least in the outer wall region.<br>
Advantageously, the entire aerofoil section may also consist of<br>
composite fiber material. Furthermore, advantageously, in an<br>
aerofoil section which becomes more slender toward the aerofoil<br>
tip, the number of fibers in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
aerofoil section decreases.<br>
The abovementioned object is achieved according to the<br>
invention, furthermore, by means of a generic turbine blade in<br>
which the aerofoil section contains, at least in regions, a<br>
composite fiber material, at least the region which contains<br>
the composite fiber material being surrounded by a deformable<br>
moisture-impermeable protective layer which prevents the<br>
penetration of moisture into the composite fiber material<br>
during the operation of the turbine blade. Furthermore, the<br>
object is achieved by means of a steam turbine which is<br>
provided with a turbine blade of this type.<br>
Consequently, moisture absorption by the aerofoil section can<br>
be effectively prevented during operation in the steam turbine.<br>
Moisture absorption is an undesirable time-dependent process<br>
which may cause an increase in weight of the component and<br>
consequently a potential unbalance of the rotor. Moreover,<br>
moisture absorption of this type may give rise to a deformation<br>
of the composite fiber material and, under continuous action,<br>
to damage to the matrix and consequently to a failure of the<br>
component containing the composite fiber material. By a<br>
moisture-impermeable protective layer being provided according<br>
to the invention, the consequences listed above and putting the<br>
operational reliability of the steam turbine at risk are<br>
avoided. So that the protective layer undergoes the expected<br>
deformations of the basic material of the aerofoil section<br>
without damage or loss of its sealing function, the protective<br><br>
layer according to the invention is designed to be deformable.<br>
In this case, according to the invention,<br><br>
the protective layer is designed so as to be deformable. The<br>
protective layer does not lose its moisture impermeability over<br>
its useful life in spite of deformations, occurring during the<br>
operation of the blade, of that region of the aerofoil section<br>
which contains the composite fiber material. This may be<br>
achieved, in particular, in that the protection layer has an<br>
elastic insert region which overshoots the utilized expansion<br>
region of the basic material. In addition to the higher steam<br>
turbine efficiency made possible by the use according to the<br>
invention of the composite fiber material in the aerofoil<br>
section, the embodiment according to the invention of the<br>
turbine blade can be employed in a particularly operationally<br>
reliable way owing to the protective layer according to the<br>
invention which is moisture-impermeable.<br>
Advantageously, the moisture-repelling protective layer<br>
surrounds the aerofoil section completely. Furthermore, it may<br>
also be expedient if the protective layer surrounds the entire<br>
turbine blade, that is to say even the blade root. In an<br>
embodiment which is advantageous according to the invention,<br>
the protective layer should be configured in such a way that a<br>
reliable adhesion of the protective layer is afforded even<br>
under the impact of drops. Furthermore, the design of the basic<br>
material of the aerofoil section should be such that continuing<br>
drop impacts cause no fatigue or spoiling of the basic<br>
material.<br>
Furthermore, the abovementioned object is achieved, according<br>
to the invention, by means of a generic turbine blade in which<br>
both the aerofoil section and the root section in each case<br>
contain, at least in regions, a composite fiber material.<br>
Moreover, the object is achieved by means of a steam turbine<br>
which is provided with a turbine blade of this type.<br>
As already mentioned above, by composite fiber material being<br>
used in the aerofoil section, the turbine blade can be<br><br>
configured with a large flow-off surface on account of the low<br>
density of the composite fiber material.<br><br>
This increases the efficiency of the steam turbine.<br>
Furthermore, owing to the simultaneous use of composite fiber<br>
material in the root section of the turbine blade, a<br>
correspondingly secure and reliable anchoring of the turbine<br>
blade in the rotor shaft of the steam turbine can be ensured.<br>
Thus, in particular, fibers of the composite fiber material can<br>
be led continuously through the aerofoil section and the root<br>
section, so that the aerofoil section and the root section make<br>
a stable connection and a break-off of the aerofoil section<br>
during the operation of the turbine blade can be effectively<br>
avoided even when higher forces occur. The operation<br>
reliability of the turbine blade during operation is<br>
consequently ensured.<br>
In order to ensure the fracture safety of the components<br>
containing the composite fiber material, the composite fiber<br>
material advantageously contains glass fibers, synthetic<br>
fibers, such as, for example, aramide fibers, and/or synthetic<br>
fibers. In particular, fiber-reinforced material CFK-HM may be<br>
used as composite fiber material.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the composite fiber<br>
material has fibers which are routed in the region of the<br>
aerofoil section at an angle deviating from a main axis of the<br>
turbine blade, in particular at the angle ± 15°, ± -30° and/or<br>
± 45° with respect to the main axis. A high torsion resistance<br>
of the aerofoil section is consequently achieved. The composite<br>
fiber plies may be arranged mirror-symmetrically with respect<br>
to the aerofoil center surface, with the result that distortion<br>
is avoided.<br>
By contrast, an asymmetric arrangement leads to distortion.<br>
This may be utilized in an advantageous alternative embodiment,<br>
if appropriate, for self-setting purposes. Owing to the nature<br>
of the arrangement of such fibers or plies, anisotropy may also<br>
be utilized, within a limited range, to achieve a directed<br><br>
change of the blade geometry as a function of the operational<br>
stresses.<br><br>
In this respect, distortion of this type may be provided, in<br>
which the blade cascade opens in the case of rotational<br>
overspeeds, so that less energy is extracted from the flow and<br>
therefore does not contribute to further run-up. The distortion<br>
may likewise be utilized for setting an optimized flow profile<br>
as a function of the flow and of the load. Thus, for example,<br>
the blade cascade can be closed in the case of a lower<br>
throughflow and be opened correspondingly in the case of a<br>
higher throughflow.<br>
In order to achieve an optimization of the blade in terms of<br>
cost and of rigidity, it is expedient if the aerofoil section<br>
has a filling body which is arranged in the aerofoil center and<br>
which is surrounded completely by the composite fiber material.<br>
So that the functioning of the deformable moisture-impermeable<br>
protective layer surrounding the region having the composite<br>
fiber material can be monitored and in order to rule out a<br>
failure of the aerofoil section, it is expedient if an<br>
electrically conductive layer is arranged below the protective<br>
layer. This electrically conductive layer serves as a warning<br>
mechanism, by means of which damage to the protective layer can<br>
be detected, whereupon counter measures, such as, for example,<br>
a replacement or exchange of the affected component, or a<br>
repair of the protective layer can be carried out in due time.<br>
An electrically conductive layer of this type may be provided<br>
either individually or in pairs with an insulation layer lying<br>
between them.<br>
In the latter instance, for the layer build-up of the aerofoil<br>
section, there is in the surface region of the latter a<br>
successive arrangement of the composite fiber material, of an<br>
electrically conductive, in particular metallic layer, of an<br>
insulation layer, of a further electrically conductive, in<br>
particular metallic layer and of the protective layer. To<br>
monitor the functioning of the protective layer, the insulation<br><br>
resistance with the respect to the surroundings or between the<br>
two electrically conductive layers can then be measured. Also,<br>
the electrical capacitance<br><br>
of the arrangement comprising the electrically conductive<br>
layer, the insulation layer and the further electrically<br>
conductive layer can be measured in order to monitor the<br>
functioning of the protective layer. If only one electrically<br>
conductive layer is provided, it is accordingly appropriate to<br>
measure the insulation resistance with respect to the<br>
surroundings or the electrical resistance of the electrically<br>
conductive layer in order to monitor the functioning of the<br>
protective layer.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, below the protective<br>
layer, water-soluble chemical substances are arranged, which<br>
are detectable in dissolved form, in particular chemically,<br>
optically and/or radiologically. This measure constitutes an<br>
alternative possibility for monitoring the functioning of the<br>
protective layer. Thus, for example, the condensate of the<br>
water/steam circuit of the steam power station can be checked<br>
continuously. If the chemical substances arranged below the<br>
protective layer can be detected in it, this indicates damage<br>
to the protective layer.<br>
In a further expedient embodiment, an onflow edge of the<br>
turbine blade is provided with edge reinforcement for<br>
protection against drop impacts. Such edge reinforcement may be<br>
provided by gluing onto the turbine blade or by laminating into<br>
the turbine blade. Also, such edge reinforcement may be<br>
produced by means of a thickened protective or intermediate<br>
layer. Furthermore, it is possible to thicken the protective<br>
layer correspondingly or to glue on or embed an additional<br>
protective component. Also, the basic component of the turbine<br>
blade itself may be configured with a turbine-like edge<br>
reinforcement. Alternatively, protection against drop impacts<br>
may be achieved by means of a laminate build-up of the turbine<br>
blade in which the fibers run in the transverse direction.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is expedient if the root section of the turbine<br>
blade has a contact element for making contact with a blade<br>
root mounting in a rotor shaft of a steam turbine,<br><br>
the contact element containing composite fiber material and/or<br>
a metallic material. The contact element may consist<br>
selectively of composite fiber material or of metallic<br>
materials. The corresponding metallic materials should be<br>
selected such that they allow a load-bearing and dimensionally<br>
stable connection with the rotor shaft and prevent an<br>
overstressing of that composite fiber material of the blade<br>
root which surrounds the contact element. In particular, the<br>
contact element may be formed by a metallic sleeve. If the<br>
above-described deformable moisture-permeable protective layer<br>
is provided, this should advantageously be specially reinforced<br>
in the root region, particularly in the contact region, or be<br>
protected against damage by means of protective elements.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the root section has<br>
a deflection element, by means of which a substantial number of<br>
fibers of the aerofoil are deflected, and/or a guide element,<br>
by means of which an advantageous fiber routing in the blade<br>
root is diverted into a fiber routing adapted to the geometry<br>
of the aerofoil section. The deflection element and/or the<br>
guide element may also in each case consist of composite fiber<br>
material or of a metallic material. In particular, the contact<br>
element and the guide element or the contact element and the<br>
deflection element may in each case be formed by the same<br>
element.<br>
Advantageously, furthermore, the root section is designed as a<br>
plug root which can be plugged into a blade root mounting of a<br>
rotor shaft of the turbine in a direction which is radial with<br>
respect to the rotor shaft. Expediently, in this case, the<br>
fibers of the composite fiber material are led around sleeves<br>
serving as contact elements. Moreover, advantageously, in a<br>
plug root of this type the aerofoil curvature can be copied in<br>
the root region by assignment to different pin positions of the<br>
plug root, so as advantageously to give rise to low deflections<br>
from the root region to the aerofoil region.<br><br>
The outlay in terms of guide elements consequently remains<br>
restricted.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the deformable moisture-<br>
impermeable protective layer also surrounds the root section. A<br>
penetration of moisture even into the composite fiber material<br>
contained in the root section is consequently effectively<br>
prevented. The useful life of the turbine blade can thereby be<br>
further increased.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the root section of the<br>
turbine blade is designed as a sliding root which can be pushed<br>
into a blade root mounting of a rotor shaft of the turbine in a<br>
direction which is essentially axial with respect to the rotor<br>
shaft. An essentially axial direction is to be understood as<br>
meaning that the push-in direction may deviate from the axial<br>
direction by up to ± 40°. In particular, the root section has a<br>
curved configuration, the root curvature following essentially<br>
that curvature of the aerofoil section which prevails in the<br>
vicinity of the root. The transmission of force to blade slots<br>
is achieved by means of deflection and contact elements.<br>
Contact elements may also perform the function of guide<br>
elements. The outlay in terms of guide elements is consequently<br>
minimized.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the steam turbine according to<br>
the invention, the latter has a device for observing the<br>
oscillation behavior of the turbine blade. A change in the<br>
characteristic frequency of the turbine blade can consequently<br>
be recognized, and this may be attributable to moisture<br>
absorption by the composite fiber material in the aerofoil<br>
section during the operation of the steam turbine. Such a<br>
change in the characteristic frequency of the turbine blade<br>
should then give cause for checking the functionality of the<br>
abovementioned deformable moisture-impermeable protective layer<br><br>
and, if appropriate, for repairing the protective layer, so<br>
that a failure of the component can be prevented.<br><br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the steam turbine has at<br>
least one heatable guide vane. Owing to heating, moisture on<br>
the guide vane can be evaporated, and corresponding damage to<br>
other turbine blades by drop impacts can be prevented.<br>
Alternatively, a device for sucking away wetness may also be<br>
provided on at least one guide vane.<br>
The production of the composite fiber blades preferably takes<br>
place by means of the conventional methods, in which fibers are<br>
wound and impregnated with the matrix material or applied in<br>
the form of what are known as prepregs. They are then brought<br>
into their final form in what is known as a die, a curing of<br>
the matrix also taking place. For this purpose, contact,<br>
deflection or guide elements are optionally also introduced or<br>
applied at this early stage. It may then be necessary to<br>
machine the blades at specific locations, for example by<br>
grinding, for example in order to achieve the required<br>
dimensional stability, tolerance adherence and surface quality.<br>
Also, already mounted contact, deflection or guide elements may<br>
be machined or these elements may be applied after the shaping<br>
operation. As already mentioned above, furthermore, edge<br>
protection may be mounted, which is integrated into the blade<br>
profile by means of subsequent adapting work, such as, for<br>
example, by grinding. Afterwards, coating with the layers<br>
required for the protective layer and for the warning system is<br>
carried out. In this case, individual layers may be designed to<br>
be reinforced at specific locations in order to improve<br>
protective or reinforcing functions.<br>

Figure 4b shows a sectional view of a rotor shaft of a steam<br>
turbine in the region of a shaft slot with a root<br>
section, fastened in it, of a turbine blade<br>
according to figure 4a, and<br>
Figure 4c shows the detail Z according to figure 4b.<br>
Figure 1 shows the first exemplary embodiment of a turbine<br>
blade 10 according to the invention which is configured<br>
particularly for use in a low-pressure stage of a steam<br>
turbine. The turbine blade 10 comprises an aerofoil section 12<br>
and a root section 14 in the form of a plug root. The root<br>
section 14 has plug-in tabs 16 for a pin connection. The<br>
aerofoil section 12 is manufactured from composite fiber<br>
material 18 which contains glass fibers and/or carbon fibers.<br><br>
The main fiber direction 20 runs along a main axis 21 of the<br>
turbine blade 10.<br><br>
In a region near the root section 14, the aerofoil section 12<br>
has an additional composite fiber ply 22. The additional<br>
composite fiber ply 22 contains additional fibers which run at<br>
a deviating angle with respect to the main axis 21 of the<br>
turbine blade 10, for example at an angle of ± 15°, ± 30° or<br>
± 45°, and are provided for stiffening the aerofoil section 12.<br>
A plurality of additional composite fiber plies 22 of this type<br>
may also be provided. In this case, these plies may be arranged<br>
mirror-symmetrically with respect to the aerofoil center<br>
surface, with the result that distortion is avoided. An<br>
asymmetric arrangement of the additional composite fiber plies<br>
leads to distortion. This may be utilized, if appropriate, for<br>
self-setting purposes.<br>
Figure 2 shows the section II-II in the aerofoil section 12<br>
according to figure 1. This shows a filling body 24 arranged in<br>
the region of great aerofoil thickness for optimization in<br>
terms of weight and of rigidity. This filling body is<br>
surrounded by the composite fiber material 18. The turbine<br>
steam 2 6 flows onto the turbine blade 10 from the left<br>
according to figure 2. For protection against drop impacts, the<br>
onflow edge, facing the inflowing turbine steam 26, of the<br>
turbine blade 10 is provided with edge reinforcement 28. The<br>
edge reinforcement 28 is illustrated in more detail in figure<br>
2c. It consists of metal and is fastened to the onflow edge 27<br>
of the turbine blade 10 by means of an adhesive bond 40 having<br>
a run-out 42 appropriate in terms of adhesive bonding and of<br>
the composite fibers.<br>
Figure 2a illustrates the first embodiment of the build-up of<br>
the turbine blade 10 according to figure 2 in a surface region<br>
of the latter. The inner composite fiber material 18 is in this<br>
case surrounded by a first electrically conductive layer 36 in<br>
the form of a metallic layer, by an insulation layer 34, by a<br>
second electrically conductive layer 32 in the form of a<br>
metallic layer and finally by a protective layer 30. The<br><br>
protective layer 30 is designed to be moisture-repelling for<br>
sealing off the aerofoil section 12 with respect to liquid.<br><br>
The protective layer 30 consequently prevents a penetration of<br>
moisture into the composite fiber material 18. Furthermore, the<br>
protective layer 30 is designed to be deformable such that,<br>
without any loss of its sealing function, it compensates the<br>
deformations to be expected during the operation of the turbine<br>
blade 10. The successive arrangement of the electrically<br>
conductive layer 32, of the insulation layer 34, and of the<br>
electrically conductive layer 36 serves for monitoring the<br>
functioning of the protective layer 30. For this purpose, the<br>
insulation resistance of the electrically conductive layers 30,<br>
32 with respect to the surroundings or between the layers or<br>
the capacitance of the layer arrangement is measured, in order<br>
to ascertain whether moisture has penetrated through the<br>
protection layer 30 into the interior of the aerofoil section<br>
12.<br>
Figure 2b shows a second embodiment of the build-up of the<br>
turbine blade 10 according to figure 2 in the surface region of<br>
the latter. Here, the composite fiber material 18 is surrounded<br>
by a layer of indication material 30 which is surrounded, in<br>
turn, by the protective layer 30. The indication material 38 is<br>
in the form of water-soluble substances which are detectable in<br>
dissolved form chemically, optically and/or radiologically. The<br>
indication material 38 consequently serves for detecting a leak<br>
in the protective layer 30. To be precise, if moisture<br>
penetrates into the interior of the aerofoil section 12, the<br>
water-soluble chemical substances of the indication material 38<br>
are dissolved and can be detected in the condensate which has<br>
come from the steam leaving the turbine.<br>
Figure 3a shows a second exemplary embodiment of a turbine<br>
blade 110 according to the invention. A root section 43 adjoins<br>
an only partially shown aerofoil section 12 with composite<br>
fiber material 18. In this case, the fibers of the composite<br>
fiber material 18 are routed from the aerofoil section 12 into<br>
the root section 43 and in the latter are led around a contact<br><br>
and deflection element 46 in the form of a metallic sleeve,<br>
whereupon the fiber then<br><br>
runs back again into the aerofoil section 12. The element 46<br>
consequently fulfills a deflection function. At the same time,<br>
it also performs a contact function in that it makes contact<br>
with a shaft slot 48 of a rotor shaft 47 of a steam turbine.<br>
Furthermore, according to figure 3a, the turbine blade 110<br>
comprises what is known as a guide element 44, by means of<br>
which an advantageous fiber routing in the blade root is<br>
diverted into a fiber rooting, adapted to the geometry of the<br>
aerofoil section 12, of the composite fiber material 18.<br>
Figure 3b shows the section III-III according to figure 3a. The-<br>
root section 43 is designed in the form of a plug root with<br>
plug-in tabs 45 for plugging into corresponding shaft slots 48<br>
running transversely with respect to a longitudinal axis 50 of<br>
a rotor shaft 47. The plug-in tabs 45 are then fastened by<br>
means of plug-in pins arranged transversely to them in the<br>
shaft slots 48. Each of these plug roots 45 has one of the<br>
contact elements and deflection elements 46.<br>
Figure 4a illustrates a third exemplary embodiment of a turbine<br>
blade 210 according to the invention with a root section 52 in<br>
the form of a sliding root. The root section 52, which is<br>
illustrated more precisely in a sectional view in figure 4b, is<br>
pushed into a shaft slot 60 running in the axial direction of<br>
the rotor shaft. The root section 52 is in this case provided<br>
with a curvature, as illustrated in figure 4a, and has a<br>
deflection element 56, around which a substantial number of<br>
fibers of the composite fiber material 18 are led. These fibers<br>
are surrounded by a guide or contact element 54. This element<br>
initially fulfills the function of diverting an advantageous<br>
fiber routing in the root section 52 into a fiber rooting<br>
adapted to the geometry of the aerofoil section 12.<br>
Furthermore, the element 54 fulfills the function of making<br>
contact with a shaft slot 60 of the rotor shaft 58. The guide<br>
and contact element 54 surrounds the composite fiber material<br>
18 of the root section 14 completely and is also contiguous to<br><br>
the composite fiber material 18 in the lower region of the<br>
fiber aerofoil section 12.<br><br>
This region is illustrated more precisely in figure 4c. In<br>
order to cause no damage to the guide and contact element 54 or<br>
to the composite fiber material 18 in the event of deformations<br>
of the aerofoil section 12, a gap 62 between the composite<br>
fiber material 18 and the element 54 is provided.<br><br>
