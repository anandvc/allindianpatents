Generally, the action of a compound of general formula (IX) on the compound of general formula (V) defined above is performed, after optional metalation of the hydroxyl function at the 10-position by means of an alkali or alkaline-earth metal hydride such as sodium hydride, an alkali metal amide such as lithium diisopropylamide or an alkali metal alkylide such as n-foutyllithium, working in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran or pyridine, at a temperature of between 0 and 50°C, followed, if necessary, by the replacement of the group protecting the hydroxyl function Z1 or R8 under the conditions described above.<br>
When Z, is different from a radical of general formula (IV), it is particularly advantageous to perform the reaction on a compound of general formula (V) in which Z1 represents a group protecting the<br><br>
hydroxyl function which is preferably a triethylsilyl radical. In this case, the protective group is introduced by the action of a trialkylsilyl halide, preferably triethylsilyl chloride, on a compound of general formula (VI) in which Z1 represents a hydrogen atom.<br>
According to the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II), R4 and R5 together form a ketone function, R6 represents a hydrogen atom, and R and R7 together form a bond, may be obtained by oxidation of a compound of general formula (V) in which Z1 is as defined above, R4 represents a hydroxyl radical, R5 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 represents a hydrogen atom and R and R7 together form a bond, followed, if necessary, by the replacement of the protective group represented by Zl  or R8 by a hydrogen atom under the conditions described above.<br>
Generally, the oxidation is performed under the conditions described above for the oxidation of a compound of general formula (VI).<br>
According to the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II), R4, Rs and R6 each represent a hydrogen atom and R and R7 together form a bond, may be obtained from a compound of general formula (V) in which Z1 is as defined above, R4 represents a hydroxyl radical, R5 and R6 each represent a hydrogen atom and R<br><br>
and R7 together form a bond, after conversion of the hydroxyl radical represented by R4 to a dithiocarbonate followed by the reduction of the compound obtained by means of a trialkyltin hydride such as tributyltin hydride, followed, if necessary, by the replacement of the protective group represented by Z1 or R8 by a hydrogen atom under the conditions described above.<br>
According to the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) may also be obtained by esterification of a compound of general formula (I) in which Z  represents a hydrogen atom by means of an acid of general formulas<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which, either R9 represents a hydrogen atom and R10 represents a group protecting the hydroxyl function, or R9 and R10 together form a saturated 5-  or 6-membered heterocycle, or by means of a derivative of this acid, followed by the replacement of the group R,0 and, where necessary, R9 by hydrogen atoms.<br>
The conditions for esterification and replacement of the protective groups are identical to those which are described, for example, in International Applications PCT WO 92/09589, WO 93/16060 and WO 94/12484.<br><br>
The taxoids of general formula (I) obtained by carrying out the processes according to the invention may be purified according to known methods such as crystallization or chromatography.<br>
The taxoids of general formula (I) in which 2 represents a radical of general formula (II) display noteworthy biological properties.<br>
In vitro, measurement of the biological activity is performed on tubulin extracted from pig's brain by the method of M.L. Shelanski et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 70, 765-768 (1973). Study of the depolymerization of microtubules to tubulin is performed according to the method of G. Chauviere et al., C.R. Acad. Sci., 293, series II, 501-503 (1981). In this study, the taxoids of general formula<br>
(I)	in which Z  represents a radical of general formula<br>
(II)	were shown to be at least as active as Taxol and<br>
Taxotere.<br>
In vivo, the taxoids of general formula (I) in which Z represents a radical of general formula (II) were shown to be active in mice grafted with B16 melanoma at doses of between,1 and, 10 mg/kgadministered intraperitoneally, as well as on other liquid or solid tumours.<br>
The taxoids have antitumour properties, and more especially activity against tumours which are resistant to Taxol® or to Taxotere®. such tumours<br><br>
the mdr 1 gene (multiple drug resistance gene). Multiple drug resistance is a customary term relating to the resistance of a tumour to different compounds having different structures and mechanisms of action. Taxoids are generally known to be strongly recognized by experimental tumours such as P388/D0X, a cell line selected for its resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) which expresses mdr 1.<br>

It is clearly understood that all the<br>
compounds participating in the compositions according to the invention must be pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
The compositions can contain at least 0.01 % of therapeutically active compound. The amount of active principle in a composition is such that a suitable dosage can be prescribed. Preferably, the compositions are prepared in such a way that a single dose contains from 0.01 to 1000 mg approximately of active principle for parenteral administration.<br>
The therapeutic treatment may be performed concurrently with other therapeutic treatments including antineoplastic drugs, monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapy or radiotherapy or biological response modifiers. The response modifiers include, without implied limitation, lymphokines and cytokines such as interieukins, interferons (a, (3  or S)   and TNF. Other chemotherapeutie agents which are useful in the treatment of disorders due to abnormal cell proliferation include, without implied limitation, alkylating agents, for instance nitrogen mustards such as mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan and chlorambucil, alkyl sulphonates such as busulfan, nitrosoureas such as carmustine, lomustine, semustine and streptozocin, triazenes such as dacarbazine, antimetabolites such as folic acid analogues, for instance methotrexate, pyrimidine analogues such as fluorouracil and cytarabine, purine analogues such as<br>
mercaptopurine and thioguanine, natural products, for instance vinca alkaloids such as vinblastine, vincristine and vindesine, epipodophyllotoxins such as etoposide and teniposide, antibiotics such as dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicamycin and mitomycin, enzymes such as L-asparaginase, various agents such as coordination complexes of platinum, for instance cisplatin, substituted ureas such as hydroxyurea, methylhydrazine derivatives such as procarbazine, adrenocortical suppressants such as mitotane and aminoglutethimide, hormones and antagonists such as adrenocorticosteroids such as prednisone, progestins such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, methoxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate, ©estrogens such as diethylstilboestrol and ethynyloestradiol, antioestrogens such as tamoxifen, and androgens such as testosterone propionate and fluoxymesterone.<br>
The doses used for carrying out the methods according to the invention are those which permit a prophylactic treatment or a maximum therapeutic response. The doses vary according to the administration form, the particular product selected and features distinctive to the subject to be treated. In general, the doses are those which are therapeutically effective for the treatment of disorders due to abnormal cell proliferation. The taxoids according to the invention may be administered<br>
as often as necessary to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Some patients may respond rapidly to relatively high or low doses, and then require low or zero maintenance doses. Generally, low doses will be used at the beginning of the treatment and, if necessary, increasingly stronger doses will be administered until an optimum effect is obtained. For other patients, it may be necessary to administer maintenance doses .1 to 8 times a day, and preferably 1 to 4 times, according to the physiological requirements of the patient in question. It is also possible that some patients may require the use of only one to two daily administrations.<br>
In man, the doses are generally between 0.0l and 200 mg/kg. For intraperitoneal administration, the doses will generally be between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg, preferably between 0.5 and 5 0 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 10 mg/kg. For intravenous administration, the doses are generally between 0.1 and 50 mg/kg, preferably between o.1 and 5 mg/kg and still more specifically between 1 and 2 mg/kg. It is understood that, in order to choose the most suitable dosage, account should be taken of the administration route, the patient's weight, general state of health and age and all factors which may influence the efficacy of the treatment.<br>
The example which follows illustrates a composition according to the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
4 0 mg of the product obtained in Example 1 are dissolved in 1 cm3 of Emulphor EL 62 0 and 1 cm3 of ethanol, and the solution is then diluted by adding 18 cm3 of physiological saline.<br>
The composition is administered by perfusion over 1 hour by introduction in physiological solution.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
