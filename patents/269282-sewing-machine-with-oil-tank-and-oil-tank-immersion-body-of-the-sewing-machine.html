Sewing Machine with Oil Tank and Oil Tank Immersion Body of the<br>
Sewing Machine<br>
The invention relates to a sewing machine with an oil tank according to the<br>
preamble of claim 1. The invention further relates to an oil tank immersion<br>
body of a sewing machine according to claim 14.<br>
Sewing machines comprise a number of bearings which must be provided<br>
with lubricant, in particular oil. To this end, sewing machines have at least<br>
one oil tank which is connected to lubricating points by conduits, The con-<br>
duits used most y are wick conduits i.e., wicks inserted in a hose, conduits<br>
of that type enabling the oil to flow slowly and continuously and to be<br>
transported not only downwards but even upwards to a restricted extent. Of<br>
course, oil must always be sufficiently available in the oil tank. However,<br>
monitoring the level of the oil tank is rather complicated, the oil tank being<br>
regularly integrated inside the housing of the sewing machine. Conse-<br>
quently it is necessary from time to time to open the housing or corre-<br>
sponding parts of the housing and to check the level.<br>
US 2 301 460 A teaches, in the case of oil-tanks located above the base<br>
plate in the stan iard or in the arm, to provide the machine housing with an<br>
inspection glass that will enable the level of oil to be checked without dis-<br>
assembly of the housing. However, discerning the level of an oil tank<br>
through an inspection glass poses some problems so that a lack of oil fre-<br>
quently remains unnoticed for some time.<br>
With sewing machines in a sewing workshop not always consuming the<br>
same quantities of oil, checking the level must take place as early as possi-<br>
ble for reasons of safety. Therefore avoiding a lack of oil in a machine and<br><br>
any possible damages that might result is accompanied with quite a few<br>
technical requirements.<br>
Oil-level indicators for sewing machines are also known from DE<br>
29 37 772 B1 and DE 29 23 750 A1.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve a sewing machine of the<br>
type mentioned at the outset in such a way that an oil-level monitoring sys-<br>
tem of simple design is obtained that works reliably and can possibly be<br>
retrofitted.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained in a sewing machine<br>
comprising the features mentioned in the characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The invention proceeds from the idea that a light beam that hits the reflec-<br>
tion surface of the immersion body passes through the reflection surface<br>
into the oil as long as the reflection surface is wetted by oil, but that it will<br>
be reflected one e the level has lowered to such an extent that oil no longer<br>
rinses the reflection surface. Then the light beam will be reflected by the<br>
reflection surface and can be absorbed by a light receiver, for example a<br>
photo-active diode, thus triggering a switching pulse for an optical or<br>
acoustic alert signal. The material of the immersion body is transparent<br>
when it is permeable to light of a given wavelength, namely the wavelength<br>
of the light beam emitted by the source of light. The immersion body may<br>
for instance be a hollow body having a bottom of transparent material, or it<br>
may be a structure entirely of transparent material in which the outer sur-<br>
faces constitute the reflection surfaces.<br><br>
Preferably the immersion body is inserted vertieally from above into the oil<br>
tank, and the reflection surface is located in the bottom portion of the sub-<br>
stantially bar-shaped immersion body,<br>
A reflection surface of a design in the form of a plane surface of a transpar-<br>
ent bottom of the immersion body is easy to manufacture, simultaneously<br>
offering sufficient reflection properties.<br>
The light source and the light receiver are disposed preferably close to each<br>
other in the top area of the immersion body so that they may be arranged<br>
on a joint plate with joint electric connection. In as much as, in this context<br>
and in particular in connection with the preferred embodiment explained<br>
below, the immersion body is mentioned to be inserted from above into the<br>
oil tank and the light source as well as the light receiver to be located in the<br>
top area of the immersion body, it is stressed once again that the direction<br>
of insertion of the immersion into the oil tank is not of substantial impor-<br>
tance for the effect of the invention. The term "top" is used for simplifica-<br>
tion of wording. The immersion body may just as well enter laterally or<br>
from below into the oil tank, in which case the light source and the light<br>
receiver are preferably located in the most remote or the lowennost posi-<br>
tion of the immersion body.<br>
Recesses for the light source and the light receiver in the top area of the<br>
immersion body constitute an advantageously compact design for oil-level<br>
monitoring.<br>
The reflection surface is in particular an outer surface of the immersion<br>
body, having the mentioned sectionally reflecting properties, namely of<br>
allowing the light beam to enter into the oil as long as the immersion body<br><br>
is immersed in oil, but, upon lack of oil, having a reflecting effect. What is<br>
meant is at least a change in the reflection properties in oil on the one hand<br>
and in air on the other. Such a reflection behaviour can for instance be ob-<br>
tained by a prismatic immersion body of glass or synthetic resin.<br>
Provision may also be made for two reflection surfaces, for example two<br>
surfaces of opposite inclination, in particular opposed by 45°, the first of<br>
which reflecting the beam towards the second and the second reflecting the<br>
beam in paralle back again, In this way, the light source, for instance a<br>
light emitting d ode, and the light receiver, for example likewise a photo-<br>
active switching diode, can be disposed side by side in the top area of the<br>
immersion body in corresponding recesses.<br>
The light source and the light receiver may be disposed on a common bear-<br>
ing plate which is mounted on, for example interlocked with, the top end of<br>
the immersion body in such a way that the two diodes enter into the re-<br>
cesses of the immersion body. The immersion body, together with the light<br>
source and the light receiver as an integral unit, may be integrated in a top<br>
cover of the oil tank.<br>
The light receiver preferably controls an indicator lamp which is visible<br>
from outside, blinking when light reaches the light receiver, meaning that<br>
the oil level has sunk to such a degree that the reflection surface or reflec-<br>
tion surfaces are bare. The indicator lamp may as well be integrated in the<br>
immersion body, being mounted in particular on the bearing plate thereof<br>
and accommodated in a corresponding recess of the immersion body. Allo-<br>
cated to the md.cator lamp may be a reflection surface by which the light<br>
of the indicator lamp is deflected into a position that is visible from out-<br>
side.<br><br>
Diodes are especially suitable for the job of the light source, light receiver<br>
and the indicator lamp. These components are available at a low cost. The<br>
wavelength of the light source and the indicator lamp and, respectively, the<br>
sensitivity of the light receiver can be selected from a plurality of standard<br>
diodes for complying with the requirements of a sewing machine according<br>
to the invention in particular in terms of the immersion-body material<br>
which the emitted light will pass through.<br>
A design of the immersion body according to claim 13 is especially com-<br>
pact.<br>
In a sewing machine according to the invention, the oil tank is comprised<br>
in a vertical standard of a housing where it is located behind a window<br>
through which to see the alert signal from outside. Any lack of oil is easily<br>
visible from outside when the indicator lamp blinks. There is no need of<br>
any precautionary check, in close series, of the level of oil.<br>
Another object of the invention resides in specifying an immersion body<br>
for the oil tank of a sewing machine by which to create an oil-level moni-<br>
toring unit for retrofitting.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained by an immersion body<br>
according to claim 14.<br>
The immersion body according to the invention is suitable for retrofitting<br>
even the oil tanks of existing sewing machines easily and at a low cost. The<br>
advantages of the immersion body correspond to those discussed above in<br>
connection with the sewing machine according to the invention.<br><br>
Details of the invention will become apparent from the description of pre-<br>
ferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the drawing, in which<br>
Fig. 1 is an overall illustration of a sewing machine according to the in-<br>
vention , comprising an oil tank with an oil-deficiency display ac-<br>
cording to the invention;<br>

cover of the oil tank comprising an immersion body;<br>
Fig. 7 is a view of the oil tank from the right in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic side view of a sewing machine, comprising a base<br>
plate 10 in the form of a casing, a standard 12 standing out vertically there-<br>
from, and a horizontal arm 14 that proceeds from the top end of the stan-<br>
dard 12 in parallel to the base plate 10. A driven arm shaft (not seen in Fig.<br>
1) is conventionally supported in the arm 14;, a diagrammatically outlined<br><br>
needle bar 15 with a needle is drivable by the arm shaft in up and down<br>
reciprocation.<br>
Disposed in the standard 12 is a first oil tank 16 which will be referred to in<br>
detail below in the description. A second oil tank 18 is disposed in the cas-<br>
ing 10. The first oil tank 16 feeds an area of needle guidance (not shown)<br>
by way of a wick conduit 20 and a distributor 22 as well as a second wick<br>
conduit 24.<br>
By way of another wick conduit 26, the first oil tank 16 supplies the second<br>
oil tank 18 with oil, the second oil tank 18 being again connected to a shut-<br>
tle 30 via another wick conduit 28. A bottom area of the base plate 10 ac-<br>
commodates an oilpan 32 that serves for collecting any dripping oil. This<br>
oil is pumped, back to the distributor 22 via a conduit 34 where a pump 36<br>
is located that is driven by a motor 38. Further details of the overall sewing<br>
machine are of the importance in this context.<br>
The following i s a detailed description of the oil tank 16, taken in conjunc-<br>
tion with Figs. to 7. According to Figs. 2 and 3, the oil tank 16 has a box<br>
frame 40, some details of the shape of which being adapted to the locally<br>
available space as seen in Fig. 3. The oil tank 16 is fitted into a recess 42 of<br>
a casing wall 44 of the standard 12 of the sewing machine. The box frame<br>
40 is closed by a cover 46 that is seen in particular in Figs. 2 and 4. The<br>
cover 46 comprises a raised area 48 of stepped ascent and a lower area 50<br>
substantially in the form of a plate. This plate-type area 50 has two holes<br>
52, 54 passing into tubes 56, 58 on a bottom side of the plate-type area 50.<br><br>
These tubes accommodate the wick conduits 20,26 which have been men-<br>
tioned in connection, with Fig. 1 and are shown in Figs. 2 and 7, but not in<br>
the other illustrations.<br>
Between the two tubes 56, 58, an immersion body 60 is fixed to the bottom<br>
side of the plate-type area 50 of the cover 46, in particular integrally<br>
molded on the cover 46 as a one-piece plastic piece. The immersion body<br>
60 projects into a supplies reservoir 61 of the oil tank 16. Three holes 62,<br>
64,66 of triangular arrangement are located in the plate-type area 50; they<br>
are allocated to the immersion body 60, passing into corresponding re-<br>
cesses 68, 70,72 in the top area of the immersion body 60. Two recesses<br>
68, 70 which align with the holes 62, 64 are illustrated in Fig. 6. The third<br>
recess 72 which aligns with the third hole 66 is seen in Fig. 5.<br>
Apart from these recesses 68, 70, 72, the immersion body 60 is a solid<br>
structure of transparent material, for instance' acrylic glass.<br>
A bearing plate 74 is placed on the cover 46 in the vicinity of the immer-<br>
sion body 60; it is in particular locked into place by the aid of a detent 76<br>
that is integrally molded on the cover 46. Disposed on the bearing plate 74,<br>
in positions allocated to the three recesses 68, 70, 72, are a light emitting<br>
diode 78 as a light source, a photodiode 80 as a light receiving, diode, and<br>
another light emitting diode 82. The photodiode 80 and the additional, light<br>
emitting diode 112 are connected for signalling. The additional light emit-<br>
ting diode 82 serves as an indicator lamp to be switched on and off by the<br>
photodiode 80.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 are two sectional views, perpendicular to one another, of the<br>
immersion body 60, seen on the lines V-V and VI-VI of Fig 3 The sec-<br><br>
tional view of Fig, 6 shows the light emitting diode 78 and the photodiode<br>
80. The sectional view of Fig. 5 shows the indicator lamp 82.<br>
A bottom of the immersion body 60 comprises two slopes which incline<br>
towards each other by approximately 45° and are designated as surfaces of<br>
reflection 84, 8(i. A light beam 88 emitted by the light emitting diode 78<br>
hits the first reflection surface 84. As long as the immersion body 60 is<br>
immersed in the oil bath inside the oil tank 16, the beam runs substantially<br>
straight through the reflection surface 84 into the oil bath as outlined by a<br>
dot-dashed line.<br>
When the oil bath has dropped to such an extent that the bottom of the im-<br>
mersion body 6) lies bare, the light beam 88 is deflected by the two reflec-<br>
tion surfaces 84, 86 in such a way that it is reflected in parallel towards the<br>
photodiode 80. The photodiode 80 emits a switching pulse, switching on<br>
the indicator larap 82 so that it emits a light signal.<br>
As mentioned, the wall 90 (on the right in Figs. 2 and 3) of the box frame<br>
40 is embedded in the recess 42 of the casing wall 44 of the sewing ma-<br>
chine. The result is a window 92 (Fig. 1) through which the oil tank 16 be-<br>
comes visible from outside. With the recess 42 not dimensioned for the<br>
indicator lamp 82 to be visible directly from outside, the light beam of the<br>
indicator lamp K2 is led through an attachment 94 of the immersion body<br>
60 and on to a reflection surface 96, disposed by 45°, of the attachment,<br>
from where it is reflected by 90° out of the immersion body 60 and out-<br>
wards through the window 92. This means that the signal of the light emit-<br>
ting diode 78 is visible from far at a characteristic place on the outside of<br>
the sewing machine, drawing the staffs attention to the lack of oil.<br><br>
It must be added that Figs.-2,4,5 and 6 show a line 98, also seen in Fig. 1,<br>
which produces a connection between the diodes 78 to 82 and supply elec-<br>
tronics 100.<br>
The invention creates a compact oil-level monitoring unit which can be<br>
used for example as a substitute in connection with a conventional oil tank.<br>
The cover 46 ard the immersion body 60 can be injection-molded as an<br>
integral unit. Electric connections need to be provided only as far as to the<br>
bearing plate 74 on the top side of the immersion body 60. No movable<br>
parts are in the oil bath, nor are there any electric or electronic lines.<br>
As mentioned, the spatial orientation, namely the insertion of the immer-<br>
sion body 60 from above, laterally or from below, is of no importance per<br>
se. It is decisive that the immersion body 60 comprises a surface which is<br>
temporarily immersed in oil when the oil tank 16 is full and which lies bare<br>
as the oil tank 16 empties.<br>
In any case it is advantageous that the cover 46 of the oil tank 16 or any<br>
corresponding c overing member be injection-molded integrally with the<br>
immersion body 60.<br>
The shape of the immersion body 60 is of no importance either. Solely a<br>
reflection surface is indispensable, to which to emit a light beam from the<br>
light source i.e. from the light emitting diode 78. This can be put into prac-<br>
tice directly or by deflection via additional reflection surfaces.<br>
Of course, the second oil tank 18 which is disposed in the base plate 10 of<br>
the machine can be provided with an oil-deficiency indicator or oil-level<br>
monitoring unit according to the invention, in the same way as the oil tank<br><br>
16 of the embodiment described. However, level monitoring, according to<br>
the invention, of the top oil tank 16 is especially advantageous, provided<br>
the oil tank 16 is connected to the bottom oil tank 18 in the way of the em-<br>
bodiment described. The bottom oil tank 18 is connected to the top tank via<br>
the conduit 26, md a check valve (not referenced) prevents the bottom oil<br>
tank 18 from running over. This means that the bottom oil tank 18 will al-<br>
ways be filled appropriately as long as there is any substantial quantity of<br>
oil in the top oil tank 16.<br>
In other words, monitoring the top oil tank 16 by an indicator system ac-<br>
cording to the invention provides for the fact that both oil tanks 16,18 are<br>
always filled adequately.<br><br>
