				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a microwave oven door, which can shield (or seal) the leakage of microwave. More particularly, the present invention relates to a microwave oven door having a microwave shielding structure which maximizes the shielding of the microwave leakage to outside by forming a choke structure having a short-circuiting transmission path at an end of a conductor plate, to effectively protect the human body from harmful microwaves.<br>
2.	Prior Arts<br>
Generally, home microwave ovens are provided with a magnetron for generating microwaves. In the electric field room of a microwave oven, there is provided a magnetron for generating microwaves. Such microwaves are generated when a high voltage produced by primary and secondary induction coils of a high potential transformer that is attached on a base plate of the electric field room, is stably supplied to the magnetron, the high voltage being generated through the inductive interaction between the induction coils. Such microwaves are irradiated into a cooking chamber of a microwave oven through an irradiating tube. When the microwaves are irradiated into the cooking chamber after passing through the irradiating tube, the food placed within the cooking chamber is heated in order to ;    cooked.<br><br>
cathode and an anode. When the high voltage is supplied to the magnetron to generate microwaves, unnecessary microwaves radiating through cathode and filament, i.e., noises and microwaves having basic frequencies which are suitable for heating the food, are generated. Then, the noises flow back through the filament and the cathode, causing wave obstructions in nearby apparatuses.<br>
Because such microwaves are radio waves harmful to human body, its leakage to the outside is prevented while cooking. A door of the microwave oven is provided for withdrawing the cooked food through the front of the cooking chamber. The cooked state of the food can be recognized without opening the door, and the door has a choke structure to prevent leakage of the microwaves even though it is closed.<br>
Conventionally, doors with choke structures are divided into those of one piece-type (IPC) and two pieces-type (2PCS). FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view for .showing a conventional door having a 2PCS-type choke structure, which is attached to a cooking chamber 102 of a microwave oven cavity 101. FIG. lOA is a detailed cross-sectional view for showing the 2PCS-type choke structure as shown in FIG. 9, in which a microwave absorber is not attached, and FIG. lOB is a detailed cross-sectional view for showing the 2PCS-type choke structure as shown in FIG. 9, in which a microwave absorber is attached. As shown in the figures, a door having the 2PCS type choke structure comprises two components consisting of a door frame 105 to form a choke structure (or choke part) 106 and a door screen 104 having perforations. A front panel l03' is provided at the overall peripheral region of an entrance HI of cooking chamber 102 of microwave oven cavity 101. A door screen 104 having perforations through which the-cooked state of food 110 in cooking<br><br>
chamber 102 can be recognized from outside, is formed on the front panel 103. Front panel 103 and a sealing surface 115 formed at the peripheral ponion of door screen 104 primarily seals the microwave leakage by the junction between the metal plates. At the overall peripheral region of door screen 104, a door frame 105 is integrally formed by a binding method such as a projection weld 114. Around the end portion of door frame 105, a bending portion 112 as a protruded portion having a rectangular shape, is provided. An opening 113 is provided between bending ponion 112 and door screen 104 to form a choke structure 106 inside door frame 105.<br>
As shown in FIG. lOB, a microwave absorber 107 is installed at opening 113.   In FIGs. lOA and lOB, /i and /, mean each continuous distance between the centers of choke structure 106 consisting of opening 113 and short-circuiting wall 108, respectively.  They form a microwave path.<br>
FIGs. UA and IIB are cross-sectional views for showing -a conventional 1 PC-type door. FIG. IIA shows a conventional 1 PC-type choke strucmre in which a microwave absorber is not attached, and FIG. UB shows a conventional IPC-type choke strucmre in which a microwave absorber is attached.<br>
As illustrated in the figures, the conventional IPC-type door has a door frame 205 having a choke structure 206 as one PC type on a front panel 203 provided at the overall peripheral region of the entrance of a cooking chamber 202. Front panel 203 and the peripheral portion of door frame 205 meet each other (junctioned) via a sealing surface 215 in order to primarily shield the microwave leakage by the junction of metals. As in door frame 104 of 2PCS-type shown in FIG. 9, door frame 205 has perforations to recognize the cooked state of food in<br><br>
cooking chamber 202, and a bending ponion 212 is integrally formed at the peripheral ponion of sealing surface 215 so as to have a predetermined height h •   which meets front panel 203. Inside bending ponion 212, a choke structure 206 is provided to prevent the leakage of the microwave which has been primarily shielded by sealing surface 215. At the outer ponion of choke structure 213, an opening 213 is formed, in which a microwave absorber 207 is provided. In the IPC-type door, the central depth I3 that corresponds to the height h of bending ponion 212 forms the microwave path.<br>
The choke structures of 2PCS- and IPC-type door are all based upon the technical idea for decreasing the microwave leakage by allowing the microwave paths 109 and 209 to be free space wavelength of the microwave)..<br>
When the characteristic impedance of the shon-circuiting transmission path (in the choke structure) is ZQ, a path length (which means the length of the microwave path) is 1, and an input impedance from the transmission path entrance (which means the opening of the choke structure) to the end of the path when the end of the path is shon-circuited (when shon-circuited, the load impedance ZL is<br><br>
free space wavelength), is established.<br>
The microwave leakage decreasing apparatuses (shielding apparatus) having the above IPC and 2PCS type, in which the microwave path of the choke structure is determined as are based upon the principle of achieving the input<br>
impedance of the microwave transmission path of IPC type door (the distance from opening 213 to the inner surface of a short-circuiting wall 208, <br><br><br>
Also, as shown in FIG. lOB, the microwave transmission path of the 2PCS-type door, the input impedance at opening 113 of choke strucmre 106 | ZN 1 =00 is achieved by allowing the central continuous distance from opening 113 of choke structure 106 to the inner surface of short-circuiting wall 108, I1+I2 to be l/4»\j,<br>
There are several problems in the above IPC and 2PCS type doors.<br>
Firstly, the size of the choke strucmre is large. More particularly, the microwave transmission path is restricted to the depth of choke strucmre 206 in case of IPC type door, and therefore the size of bending ponion 205 of the door should be large. In 2PCS type door, the microwave transmission path consists of the central continuous distance of choke strucmre 106, Ij+lj. Therefore, since the microwave transmission path is limited by the depth and length of choke strucmre 106, the choke strucmre of the 2PCS type door can be formed smaller than that of IPC type door. However, there is still a limit in reducing the choke size while maintaining the microwave transmission path as l/4»Xo. -Therefore, it is difficult to achieve a compact door.<br>
Secondly, due to the insufficient microwave decreasing ability, additional microwave absorbers 107 and 207 are necessary. For example, two components of door screen 104 and door frame 105 are integrally formed by a method such as projection weld 114 to form a primary sealing surface 115 in the 2PCS type door. During the welding process, a welding residue remains or deformation of the conductive surface due to the heat occurs on the primary sealing surface 115 so that<br>
the smoothness of door screen 104 becomes degraded. Therefore, not only the<br>
ij primary sealing effect is degraded but it is also difficult to form choke structure 106<br>
having the accurate dimension via the welding process of the two conductors, and<br><br>
therefore, the microwave reducing ability decreases. Thus, expensive components such as microwave absorber 107 are necessary.<br>
Thirdly, the productivity of the door is low. In the IPC tv'pe door, choke structure 206 is formed by only setting the depth of choke structure 206. When the microwave wavelength is considered, the choke structure that has a drawing shape of about 30mm depth at the peripheral region of the conductor plate is very difficult to manufacture. Also, in the 2PCS type door, two components are integrally formed via hard works such as dimension controlling, welding controlling, etc. and thus its productivity becomes very low.<br>
Fourthly, providing the choke structure is expensive. As mentioned above, additional components such as microwave absorbers 107 and 207 are necessary and also its productivity is lowered due to the difficulties in the manufacturing process thereof, which results in high cost.<br>
Meanwhile, a microwave ovens choke structure having a G-shaped profile is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,645,892 (issued to Jan A.C. Gustafsson). FIG. 12A is a sectional view of an oven cavity 310 with a door 319 having the above choke structure disclosed in the above U.S. patent, and FIG. 12B is an enlarged view of the choke structure as illustrated in FIG. 12A.<br>
At the front of a front panel 318, door 319 is provided parallel. A choke 320 is made by folding of a pre-punched sheet and has a G-shaped profile as shown in FIG. 12B. The microwave transmission path L starts from an irmer portion 327, via an input opening 326, and past a partition wall 323), to a short-circuiting wall 324 and its length is 1/2X (wherein X is the wavelength) long. The microwave disappears through the U-shaped path inside the choke.<br><br>
In the choke structure described in the above U.S. patent, a partition wall should be provided with transverse slots to decrease microwave leakage. Further, it is difficult to determine the size of the choke structure because the microwave transmission path leads from the inner ponion 327 of the sealing surface in order to have a 1/2*X length. That is, according to above U.S. Patent, the choke structure may be constructed in either a very small size or a very large size.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>

)escription of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail, with reference ) the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic perspective view of a choke structure as a microwave lielding strucmre for a microwave oven door according to one embodiment of the resent invention. FIG. 2 is a detailed pers'pective view of the choke strucmre as lown in FIG. 1. As illustrated in the figures, at the front portion of a.microwave<br><br>
oven cavity (101 in FIG. 9), a front panel is provided along the circumference (the peripheral portion) of a cavity 101 and a microwave oven door is attached to the front panel. The microwave oven door has a door frame 20, wherein a door screen 10 is formed at the middle (or central) region and a choke structure 22 is formed at the peripheral region. Perforations 11 for enabling one to recognize the cooked state of food are formed at the peripheral region of door screen 10. A sealing surface 21 is formed at the peripheral region of door frame 20 which is located at the outer circumference region of door screen 10 primarily for preventing microwave leakage from the microwave oven by closely adhering to the front panel (3 in FIGs. 3A and SB and 103 in FIG. 9). A drawn side wall 23 is formed by extending sealing surface 21 so that it is perpendicularly bent from sealing surface 21 towards outside (opposite to the front panel). A lower choke wall 24 is formed by integrally extending from an end of drawn side wall 23 and by perpendicularly bending it outwards (opposite to a door screen 10). An outer choke wall 25 is formed by perpendicularly bending from the end of lower choke wall 24 and integrally extending it toward sealing surface 21. An upper choke wall 26, as a short-circuiting wall, is formed by perpendicularly bending an end of outer choke wall 25 and extending it toward sealing surface 21. A partition wall 27 is formed by perpendicularly bending an end of a choke upper wall 26 and bending it toward the inside of the choke strucmre.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a plurality of slits 28 are formed at outer choke wall 25, at upper choke wall 26 and at partition wall 27 of choke strucmre 22 to provide a plurality of open transmission paths. Slit: 28 are traversely formed by crossing choke structure 22, which is formed along the overall peripheral region of door<br><br>
frame 20 so that choke structure 22 is divided into a plurality of chokes. As illustrated in the figures, slits 28 are continuously formed at panition wall 27, at upper choke wall 26, and at outer choke wall 25.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, impedance reinforcing holes 29 are formed at ponions of lower choke wall 24, which face slits 28, between a choke and an adjacent choke. In the present embodiment, impedance reinforcing holes 29 are formed in a rectangular shape, but in another embodiment, these may be formed in a circular shape.<br>
The width (S) and the depth (H,) of slits 28, the choke width (a) in choke<br>
structure 22, and the width (W) of impedance reinforcing hole 29 relate to the<br>
structural strength of door frame 20 and to the degree of the microwave leakage<br>
shielding. These dimensions are determined by appropriately considering such<br>
aspects. The depth H, of slits 28 formed at outer choke wall 25 of choke structure<br>
22, is preferably, greater than the height (or the depth) Hi of partition wall 27,	-■<br>
which protrudes from upper choke wall 26. Also, it is preferable that the width (a) of the chokes divided by slits 28 is smaller than l/4Xo and the width (S) of slits 28 is not more than 2/3(a). The width (W) of impedance reinforcing hole 29 is preferably not more than the width (S) of slits 28.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, saying that microwave transmission directions are x, y and z directions, then the width (a) of choke structure 22 and the width S of slits 28, which are gaped in the x direction of choke structure 22 and continuously formed in the y direction at partition wall 27, at upper choke wall 26, and at outer choke wall 25, is determined under such c6nditions so as to prevent the microwave leakage in the x direction. Slits 28 form an appropriate microwave transmission<br><br>
field by forming a plurality of open transmission paths in the x directions. Therefore, the impedance of choke strucnire 22 in the x direction increases. Funher, impedance reinforcing holes 29 increase the impedance by decreasing the area between two opposing conductor surfaces, i.e. the front panel (103 in FIG. 9) of the cooking chamber and lower choke wall 24, which opposes slits 28 of upper choke wall 26.<br>
As mentioned above, the microwave leakage prevention effect is enhanced by increasing the characteristic impedance of each of the open transmission paths as well as by increasing the input impedance of each of the transmission paths formed in the x direction.<br>
FIG. 3A is a sectional view for illustrating the microwave transmission paths, wherein the choke structure as shown in FIGs. 1 and 2 is attached to front panel 3, and FIG. 3B is a view for explaming in detail the attached state of the choke strucmre as shown in FIG. 3A. FIGs. 4A, 4B and 4C respectively are also sectional views of the choke structure for illustrating each of the microwave transmission paths as shown in FIGs. 3A and 3B.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3A, a first short-circuiting transmission path (A) having the length of l1, a second short-circuiting transmission path (B), having the length of I'2 and a third short-circuiting transmission path (C), having the length of /'3 are formed in choke structure 22 according to the present embodiment. As shown in FIG. 4A, the first short-circuiting transmission path (A) leads from a first opening 41, a starting point which is formed between drawn side wall 23 and the end of upper choke wall 26, and which consists of a primary first short-circuiting transmission path (Al) and a secondary first short-circuiting transmission path (A2).<br><br>
The primary first shon-cir^uiting transmission path (Al), having length of l\^. is formed by drawn side wall 23 and panition wall 27. The secondary first shon-circuiting transmission path (A2) having length of l\. starts at the end of panition ■ wall 27, and is formed by outer choke wall 25 and drawn side wall 23. The first short-circuiting transmission path (A) having the length of/'i( = /'ii + l'^.) stans at first opening 41, which is formed by panition wall 27 having length of /',[ (which corresponds to height Hi in FIG. 2) and the irmer surface of drawn side wall 23, and reaches the inner side of lower choke wall 24 as, the short-circuiting surface. As shown in FIG. 3, the first short-circuiting transmission path (A) is formed by extending the center line of first opening 41 from first opening 41 to the inner surface of lower choke wall 24. In other words, the transmission path in the first short-circuiting transmission path (A) is formed by drawn side wall 23, partition wall 27 and outer choke wall 25.<br>
.The second shon-circuiting transmission path (B) starts at second opening 42 as a starting point, which is formed by the end of partition wall 27 and the inner surface of lower choke wall 24 and has a length of /12. and reaches the inner surface of outer choke wall 25, as the short-circuiting surface, and the second short-circuiting path (B) is formed.by extending the center line of second opening 42.

The transmission path in the third<br><br>
short-circuiting transmission path (C) is formed by outer choke wall 25 and partition wall 27.<br>
The microwave path of the choke strucmre consists of the first short-circuiting transmission path (A), the second shon-circuiting transmission path (B) and the third shon-circuiting transmission path (C), and the sum of these path's lengths (/'„ + /'n + I'. +l\) is l/4«Xo.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3B, the junction distance between sealing surface 21 and front panel 3 is represented as Gj; the distance between upper choke wall 26 and front panel 3 is represented as G,; and the size of first opening 41 in FIG. 3A, i.e. the distance between partition wall 27 and drawn side wall 23, is represented as G3. Preferably, the junction distance G, between sealing surface 27 and front panel 3 is as short as possible, while still providing the microwave shielding effect. Although it is impossible to remove the junction distance G1 because of the structure of a microwave oven structure, G1 is preferably less than 1.0mm. The distance Gj between front panel 3 and upper choke wall 26 is preferably as short as possible, while a component such as a gasket for preventing any contamination or such as a decoration strucmre is allowed to be attached to the front panel.<br>
Hereinafter, the microwave shielding mechanism will be described in detail referring to FIGs. 4A, 4B and 4C.<br>
When a microwave leaks through the gap between front panel 3 and sealing surface 21, which has a distance of G; in FIG. 3B, the leaked microwave travels from first opening 41 as a starting point via the primary first short-circuiting transmission path (Al), which has a length'of /11 and is formed by drawn side wall 23 and partition wall 27, and the secondary first short-circuiting transmission path<br><br>
(A2), which has a length of /',. and is formed bv drawn side wall 23 and outer choke wall 25, as shown in FIG. 4A. Then, the leaked microwave reaches the inner surface of lower choke wall 24 via first short-circuiting transmission path (Al), whose length is /'11 + /'12. Then, as shown in FIG. 4B, the microwave reaches the inner surface of outer choke wall 25 after travelling the second short-circuiting transmission path (B), which has a length of / , which starts from second opening 42 as a starting point, and is formed by lower choke wall 24 and upper choke wall 26. Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 4C, the microwave reaches the inner surface of upper choke wall 26, which is the final shon-circuiting surface, via the third short-circuiting transmission path (C) which has a transmission path with the length of /'j, stans from third opening 43, and is formed by outer choke wall 25 and partition wall 27. Finally, the length of the microwave transmission path becomes / = (/'n +<br>
FIGs. 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B respectively are cross-sectional views of the choke structure in a microwave oven according to another embodiment. FIG. 5A is a sectional view for illustrating a microwave transmission path, wherein the choke strucoire according to this embodiment is attached to a front panel 3', and FIG. 5B is a view for explaining the attached state of the choke structure as shown in FIG. 5A. FIGs. 6A and 6B respectively are sectional views of the choke structure for illustrating the microwave transmission path as shown in FIGs. 5A and 5B.<br>
The choke strucmre according to this embodiment is the same as that in the first embodiment illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2, except that the partition wall is omitted by forming an upper choke wall 2D   longer than the upper choke wall of the first embodiment. By omitting a partition wall while maintaining the same overall<br><br>
microwave transmission path in the choke structure as in the first embodiment through elongation of the upper choke wall in the second embodiment, the productivity is enhanced, since not only is the same shielding ability maintained, but the manufacturing process also is simpler.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4A, a first short-circuiting transmission path (A') having a length of /", and a second shon-circuiting transmission path (B') having a length of I "2 are formed in a choke structure 22' according to the second embodiment. As shown in FIG. 6, the first short-circuiting transmission path (A') having a length of /"[, starts from a first opening 41' and is formed by a drawn side wall 23' and an outer choke wall 25'. The first short-circuiting transmission path (A') having a length of /"i, starts from first opening 41' which is formed by the end of upper choke wall 26' and drawn side wall 23', and travels to the inner surface of a lower choke wall 24', the short-circuiting surface. Further, the first short-circuiting transmission path (A') is formed by extending the center line of first opening 41' from first opening 41' to the inner surface of lower choke wall 24'. This first short-circuiting transmission path (A') is formed by drawn side wall 23' and outer choke wall 25'. The second short-circuiting transmission path (B') starts from a second opening 42' which is formed by the end of upper choke wall 26' and a lower choke wall 24', and has a length of l"i, and travels to the inner surface of outer choke wall 25', the short-circuiting transmission surface. The second short-circuiting transmission path (B') isalso formed by extending the center line of second opening 42'. This second short-circuiting transmission path (B') is formed by lower choke wall 24' and upper choke wall 26'.<br>
Though they are not shown in the figures, as illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2,<br><br>
slits may be formed at the choke structure. The slits can be formed continuously at upper choke wall 26' and outer choke wall 25'. As shown in FIG. 2, impedance reinforcing holes 29 as the impedance reinforcing holes in the first embodiment may be formed in the second embodiment. Any funher explanation for the slits and the impedance reinforcing holes will be omitted because the e.xplanation is the same as the explanation for the first embodiment.<br>
The microwave transmission path of the choke strucmre consists of the first short-circuiting transmission path (A') and the second shon-circuiting transmission path (B'). The sum of the lengths of these paths {l'\ + Z".) is IM-XQ.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5B, as in FIG. 3B, the junction distance between a sealing surface 21' and a front panel 3' is represented as G1; the distance between upper choke wall 26' and front panel 3' is represented as G'2 and the size of the first opening in FIG. 5A, i.e. the distance between the end of upper choke wall 26' and drawn side wall 23', is represented as G'3. The explanation for G'l, G'2 and G'3 is the same as for G1, G2 and G, in FIG. 3B. Thus, any funher explanation for them will be omitted.<br>
Hereinafter, the microwave shielding mechanism will be described in detail referring to FIGs. 6A and 6B.<br>
When a microwave leaks through the gap between front panel 3' and sealing<br>
surface 21', a gap with a distance G', in FIG. 4B, the leaked microwave reaches the<br>
inner surface of lower choke wall 24' by starting from first opening 41' and then<br>
travelling through the first short-circuiting transmission path (A'), which has a<br>
length of I"I and is formed by drawn side wall 23' and outer choke wall 25', as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 6A  T'I,-^ O. .U^,„^ :_-nTr^  ^r.  .,.-    •	,      .    .<br><br>
surface of upper choke wall 26', which is the final short-circuiting plane, by staning from second opening 41' and then travelling through the second shon-circuiting transmission path (B'), which has a length of /2; and is formed by lower choke wall 24' and upper choke wall 26'. The length / of the microwave transmission path is as follows: / = /", + /", = l/4Xo.<br>
The microwave oven door having the choke structure as shown in FIGs. 1 and 2 was manufactured. The microwave leakage was measured under the state without water load with respect to changes in the size of the first opening and to the changes in the length of the microwave transmission path. At first, while fixing the junction distance G, between the sealing surface and the front panel at 0.5mm, and while fixing the distance G2 between the upper choke wall and the front panel at 3.0min, the microwave leakage was measured by changing the length of microwave transmission path / from 27.6mm to 32.6mm. FIG. 7 is a graph showing the measured microwave leakage (the vertical axis) with respect to the length (the horizontal axis) of the microwave transmission path. As can be noted from the figure, the microwave leakage appears to be at a minimum when the length of microwave transmission path is in the range of 29.6ram to 30.6ram. Therefore, it is preferable to set the length of the microwave transmission path as above, since this length obtains an excellent microwave shielding effect.<br>
Secondly, while fixing the junction distance G1 between the sealing surface and the front panel at l.0mm, and while fixing the distance G2 between the upper choke wall and the front panel at 3.0mm, the microwave leakage was measured under the state without water load while changing the size of the first opening G3, i.e. the distance between the partition wall and the drawn side wall, from 1mm to<br><br>
10mm. FIG. 8 is a graph showing the measured microwave leakage (the vertical axis) with respect to the size (the horizontal axis) of the first opening. As noted from the figure, it appears that the microwave leakage is at a minimum when the size of the first opening is in the range of 3mm to 8mm. Therefore, it is preferable to set the size of the first opening in this range so that an excellent microwave shielding effect may be obtained.<br>
As mentioned above, according to the microwave shielding structure of the microwave oven of the present invention, a plurality of discontinuous short-circuited paths are formed by forming several bending portions in the choke structure of a door frame. Furthermore, a plurality of open transmission paths are formed by dividing the choke structure into a plurality of chokes with a plurality of slits.- By forming the impedance reinforcing holes at the slit portions between the chokes, a large impedance in circuitry can be obtained between the front panel of the cooking chamber and the sealing surface of the adjacent door frame. Therefore, an excellent microwave shielding effect can be obtained without any additional microwave absorbing material, and the microwave leakage shielding can be maximized to protect the human body from harmful microwaves.<br>
