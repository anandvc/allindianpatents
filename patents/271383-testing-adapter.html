Field<br>
The invention relates to a testing adapter for testing a wireless tele-<br>
communication device.<br>
Background<br>
The manufacture of wireless telecommunication devices involves a<br>
complex testing procedure where a wireless telecommunication device is<br>
placed into a testing arrangement and subjected to mechanical and electronic<br>
tests. The testing procedure involves a mechanical contact between the testing<br>
arrangement and the wireless telecommunication device in order to position<br>
and handle the wireless telecommunication device. The formation of the me-<br>
chanical contact effects the time used for the testing procedure and techniques<br>
required for accessing a testing interface of the wireless telecommunication<br>
device. Therefore, it is useful to consider techniques for testing a wireless tele-<br>
communication device.<br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an improved testing adapter.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a testing adapter for<br>
testing a wireless telecommunication device, the testing adapter comprising a<br>
first contact member and a second contact member, the first contact member<br>
and the second contact member having at least one degree of freedom relative<br>
to each other and arranged to provide an attachable and detachable mechani-<br>
cal coupling with a surface of a component recess of the wireless telecommu-<br>
nication device on the basis of the at least one degree of freedom.<br>
The invention provides several advantages. The use of the compo-<br>
nent recess as a mechanical contact surface between the testing adapter and<br>
the wireless telecommunication device provides an efficient way to handle a<br>
wireless telecommunication device in a test environment. Furthermore, the use<br>
of the component recess as the mechanical contact surface reduces the expo-<br>
sure of the cover of the wireless telecommunication device to mechanical<br>
stress and visual defects.<br><br>

Description of embodiments<br>
With reference to Figure 1, examine an example of the structure of a<br>
testing adapter 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. The testing<br>
adapter 100 comprises a first contact member 102A and a second contact<br><br>
member 102B. The first contact member 102A and the second contact mem-<br>
ber 102B are dimensioned and mutually located such that the testing adapter<br>
100 may be fitted into a component recess 124 of a wireless telecommunica-<br>
tion device 110.<br>
The wireless telecommunication device 110 may also be referred to<br>
as a mobile phone, a cellular phone, user equipment, a mobile station, a mo-<br>
bile terminal and/or a wireless telecommunication modem. The present solu-<br>
tion, is not, however, restricted to the listed devices, but may be applied to any<br>
wireless telecommunication device connectable to a wireless telecommunica-<br>
tion network.<br>
The first contact member 102A and the second contact member<br>
102B have at least one degree of freedom 104 relative to each other so that<br>
the relative position of the first contact member 102A and the second contact<br>
member 102B may be changed, thus providing an attachable and detachable<br>
mechanical coupling between the testing adapter 100 and a surface 120A -<br>
120D of the component recess 124.<br>
The degree of freedom 104 may be a rotational degree of freedom,<br>
which enables relative rotation between the first contact member 102A and the<br>
second contact member 102B. The relative rotation may be pivoted such that<br>
the overall dimensions of the testing adapter 100 are changed during the rela-<br>
tive rotation, thus enabling the testing adapter 100 to be attached to and be<br>
detached from the component recess 124.<br>
The at least one degree of freedom 104 has a component parallel to<br>
a line between opposite portions of the surface 120A to 120D of the compo-<br>
nent recess 124. Opposite portions are, for example, portion 120C and portion<br>
120D.<br>
The relative position of the first contact member 102A and the sec-<br>
ond contact member 102B may be controlled by an actuator mechanism 112,<br>
which may be integrated into the first contact member 102A and/or the second<br>
contact member 102B.<br>
The testing adapter 100 is pressed in an installation direction 106<br>
into the component recess 124 in a disengaged position of the testing adapter<br>
100. In the disengaged position, the separation between the first contact<br>
member 102A and the second contact member 102B is less than the separa-<br>
tion between the opposite portions 120C, 120D of the component recess 124.<br>
Then, the separation between the first contact member 102A and the second<br><br>
contact member 102A is increased. When the separation is sufficient to pro-<br>
vide the mechanical coupling, an engaged position is attained, and the wire-<br>
less telecommunication device 110 is mechanically supported by the testing<br>
adapter 100. The engaged position enables the wireless telecommunication<br>
device 110 to be subjected to a testing procedure. The testing procedure may<br>
involve an access to, for example, a user interface, data buses and/or power<br>
connections of the wireless telecommunication device 110. The testing proce-<br>
dure may also involve a visual inspection of the wireless telecommunication<br>
device 110 by a testing system and/or testing personnel.<br>
The testing adapter 100 may be mounted to the testing system not<br>
shown in Figure 1A. The testing system may include a stand for positioning the<br>
testing adapter 100 into a position suitable for the testing system and/or testing<br>
personnel.<br>
The component recess 124 is typically a hollow for an attachable<br>
and a detachable component, such as a battery or a memory card. The com-<br>
ponent recess 124 may also be referred to as a battery grave or a card slot<br>
depending on the embodiment. The testing adapter 100 may be fitted accord-<br>
ing to the shape of the surface 120A to 120D of the component recess 124 in<br>
order to ensure a sufficient mechanical coupling.<br>
The first contact member 102A and the second contact member<br>
102B are made of solid material, such as plastic, ceramics or metal.<br>
With further reference to Figure 1A, the testing adapter 100 may<br>
comprise at least one electric contact member 114 for providing an electric<br>
coupling with an electric contact 108, 116 located in the component recess<br>
124. The electric contact member 114 is connected to an electric connector<br>
122, which electric connector 122 is further connected to the testing system.<br>
The electric contact members 114 provide an electric access from the testing<br>
system to electric test objects, such as power supply, SIM card slot (Subscribe<br>
Identity Module), motherboard contact points or test pads, of the wireless tele-<br>
communication device 110. The electric access enables test signals to be in-<br>
putted into and response signals to be outputted from the wireless telecommu-<br>
nication device 110. The electric contact members 114 may be located in ac-<br>
cordance with the location of the electric contacts 108, 116.<br>
With reference to Figure 1B, the testing adapter 100 is shown from<br>
a component-recess side. Electric contact members 118 contacting electric<br>
contacts 116 located in the bottom of the component recess 124 are shown.<br><br>
The electric contact members 114, 118 may slightly extend from the first con-<br>
tact member 102A and the second contact member 102B in order to ensure a<br>
sufficient electric coupling with the electric contacts 108, 116. The electric con-<br>
tacts 114,118 may be equipped with a suspension mechanism, which limits<br>
mechanical force between the electric contact member 114, 118 and the elec-<br>
tric contact 108, 116 when the testing adapter 100 is in the engaged position.<br>
Figure 2 shows an example of the testing adapter 100 connected to<br>
an external support 126, such as a stand. In this example, the testing adapter<br>
100 is in the engaged position, and the electric contact members 114, 118 are<br>
connected to the electric contacts 108, 116.<br>
With reference to examples shown in Figures 3 to 12, in an em-<br>
bodiment of the invention, the testing adapter 100 comprises a force transform-<br>
ing mechanism coupled with the first contact member 102A and the second<br>
contact member 102B. The force transforming mechanism transforms a first<br>
force component 304 into a second force component 302, wherein the first<br>
force component 304 is generated when the testing adapter 100 is pressed<br>
into the component recess 124. The second force component 302 is parallel to<br>
a line between opposite portions 120C, 120D of the surface of the component<br>
recess 124, thus providing a mechanical coupling between the portion 120D<br>
and the first contact member 102A and a mechanical coupling between the<br>
portion 120C of the component recess 124 and the second contact member<br>
102B.<br>
The testing adapter 100 may be pressed into the component recess<br>
124 by testing personnel or by an automated mechanism, such as a robot arm.<br>
With reference to Figure 3, the force transform mechanism may be<br>
implemented by setting the first contact member 102A and the second contact<br>
member 102B against each other and by introducing a folding contact 306 be-<br>
tween the first contact member 102A and the second contact member 102B. In<br>
the disengaged position of the testing adapter 100, a point of the testing<br>
adapter in the vicinity of the folding contact 306 is separated from the bottom of<br>
the component recess 124, and the end of the first contact member 102A and<br>
the end of the second contact member 102B locate in the vicinity of the bottom<br>
of the component recess 124. In this case, the first contact member 102A and<br>
the second contact member 102B form a flexible V-shaped testing adapter<br>
100, whose ends approach the opposite portions 120C, 120D of the surface of<br><br>
the component recess 124 when the first force component 304 is applied to the<br>
testing adapter 100.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the mechanical transmission<br>
mechanism comprises a first gear 300A connected to the first contact member<br>
102A and a second gear 300B connected to the second contact member<br>
102B. The first gear 300A and the second gear 300B are compatible with each<br>
other, for example, in terms of a tooth size and a tooth separation. The first<br>
gear 300A and the second gear 300B are coupled to each other and arranged<br>
to transmit rotational force between each other. The gears 300A, 300B may<br>
replace a need for the folding contact 306, thus providing a rigid contact be-<br>
tween the first contact member 102A and the second contact member 102B in<br>
a large scale of rotational angles between the first contact member 102A and<br>
the second contact member 102B.<br>
With reference to an example shown Figure 4, the testing adapter<br>
100 of Figure 3 is shown in the engaged position. The first contact member<br>
102A is in contact with the surface portion 120D while the second contact<br>
member is in contact with the surface portion 120C, thus coupling the testing<br>
adapter 100 mechanically with the wireless telecommunication device 110.<br>
The electric contact member 114 is in contact with the electric contact 108 of<br>
the component recess 124. Figure 4 also shows a portion of an extension 400<br>
of the electric contact member 114, which extension 400 may be connected to<br>
a wire or other means for electrically connecting the electric contact member<br>
114 to the testing system.<br>
With reference to an example shown in Figure 5, a testing adapter<br>
configuration of Figures 3 and 4 is shown from another perspective. Figure 5<br>
shows the extension 400 and further electric contact members 500 for con-<br>
necting to electric contacts 118 located in the bottom of the component recess<br>
124. Also, positioning means 504 for providing an accurate mechanical posi-<br>
tion of the testing adapter 100 relative to the wireless telecommunication de-<br>
vice 110 are shown.<br>
With reference to an example shown in Figures 6 to 9, in an em-<br>
bodiment of the invention, the first contact member 102A comprises first guid-<br>
ing means 600 for guiding the second contact member 102B apart from the<br>
first contact member 102A when the testing adapter is pressed into the com-<br>
ponent recess 124, thus forming the mechanical coupling between the testing<br>
adapter 100 and the surface 120C, 120D of the component recess 124.<br><br>
The first guiding means 600 may be a groove 600 formed in the side<br>
of the first contact member 102A. The second contact member 102B may<br>
comprise an extension 602, such as a bar, which extends from the body of the<br>
second contact member 102B into the groove 600.<br>
The guiding means 600 may also be a protruded guiding structure,<br>
such as a guiding rail, extending from the first contact member 102A. In such a<br>
case, the second contact member 102B comprises a contact structure com-<br>
patible with the protruded guiding structure.<br>
The guiding means 600 may have curvature so that the second con-<br>
tact member 102B has a curved trajectory when moving the second contact<br>
member 102B along the guiding means 600. When applying the first force<br>
component 304 to the first contact member 102A, the second contact member<br>
102B follows the curved trajectory relative to the first contact member 102A,<br>
thus generating a second force component 302, which increases the relative<br>
position of the first contact member 102A and the second contact member<br>
102B. In Figure 6, the testing adapter 100 is in the disengaged position while<br>
in Figure 7, the testing adapter 100 is reaching the engaged position.<br>
In Figure 8, the testing adapter of Figures 6 and 7 is in the engaged<br>
position. Figure 8 shows the electric contact member 114 which is electrically<br>
coupled with the electric contact 108. The extension 400 of the electric contact<br>
member 114 and an electric contact member 800 connected to the electric<br>
contacts 118 of the bottom of the component recess 124 are also shown.<br>
Figure 9 shows the testing adapter of Figures 6 to 8 from another<br>
perspective. A plurality of extensions 400 of the electric contact members 108<br>
are shown. The testing adapter 100 may further comprise a plurality of electric<br>
contact members 800 connecting to the electric contacts 118 located in the<br>
bottom of the component recess 124.<br>
With reference to examples of Figures 10 to 12, in an embodiment<br>
of the invention, the testing adapter 100 comprises a body 920 coupled with<br>
the first contact member 102A and the second contact member 102B. The<br>
body 920 comprises a second guiding means 926, 928, which guides the sec-<br>
ond contact member 102B apart from the first contact member 102A when the<br>
testing adapter 100 is pressed into the component recess 124, thus forming<br>
the mechanical coupling between the testing adapter 100 and the surface<br>
120C, 120D of the component recess 124.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the body 920 comprises the<br>
second guiding means 926 for guiding the first contact member 102A, and the<br>
second contact member 102B is connected to the body 920. In such a case,<br>
the second guiding means 928 for guiding the second contact member 102B<br>
may not exist.<br>
The second guiding means 926, 928 may be a groove formed in the<br>
body 920. The second guiding means 926, 928 may also be a protruded guid-<br>
ing structure.<br>
The first contact member 102A and the second contact member<br>
102B may have an extension 922 and 924, respectively, to be guided by the<br>
second guiding means 926, 928.<br>
The guiding means 926, 928 may have curvature so that the first<br>
contact member 102A and the second contact member 102B have curved tra-<br>
jectories when moving the first contact member 102A and the second contact<br>
member 102B along the guiding means 926, 928. When applying the first force<br>
component 304 to the body 920, the first contact member 102A and the sec-<br>
ond contact member 102B follow the curved trajectories, thus generating a<br>
second force component 302, which increases the relative position of the first<br>
contact member 102A and the second contact member 102B. In Figure 10, the<br>
testing adapter 100 is in the disengaged position while in Figures 11 and 12,<br>
the testing adapter 100 is in the engaged positions.<br>
Figure 11 further shows the extension 400 and the electric contact<br>
member 114 connected to the electric contact 108. The electric contact mem-<br>
bers 800 contacting the electric contacts 118 located in the bottom of the com-<br>
ponent recess 124 are shown.<br>
With reference to Figure 12, another perspective of Figures 10 and<br>
11 is shown. Figure 12 shows the gears 940A, 940B, whose function and<br>
structure may be similar to those described in conjunction with Figures 3 to 5.<br>
With reference to Figure 13, in an embodiment of the invention, the<br>
first contact member 102A comprises a third guiding means 944, such as guid-<br>
ing rails, for guiding the second contact member 102B in the direction compris-<br>
ing a direction component parallel to a line between the opposite portions<br>
120C, 120D of the surface of the component recess 124. The testing adapter<br>
100 further comprises a force transmission means 942 coupled with the first<br>
contact member 102A or the second contact member 102B. The force trans-<br>
mission means 942 transmits an external force 948 for sliding the first contact<br><br>
member 102A relative to the second contact member 102B. The force trans-<br>
mission means 942 may comprise a bar extending from the first contact mem-<br>
ber 102A or the second contact member 102B, and a bearing 952 for providing<br>
a smooth support from an external structure 950.<br>
The second contact member 102B may comprise an open groove<br>
compatible with the guiding means 944 in order to provide a sufficient me-<br>
chanical contact between the first contact member 102A and the second con-<br>
tact member 102B.<br>
The testing adapter 100 may further be axially pivoted to the exter-<br>
nal structure 950. The force transmission means 942 is supported by the ex-<br>
ternal structure 950 when the testing adapter 100 is rotated about an axial<br>
pivot 940, thus causing the first contact member 102A to slide along the third<br>
guiding means 944. In the example of Figure 13, the testing adapter 100 is<br>
arranged to provide the engaged position when the force directed at the force<br>
transmission means 942 from the external support 950 is decreased. The force<br>
from the external support 950 may be controlled by turning the wireless tele-<br>
communication device 110 in the direction shown by arrow 946. The testing<br>
adapter 100 may further comprise a force means, such as a spring, for forcing<br>
the testing adapter 100 into the engaged position when the external support<br>
950 is not applied. The testing adapter 100 is released from the engaged posi-<br>
tion when supporting the testing adapter 100 to the external support 950.<br>
Even though the invention has been described above with reference<br>
to an example according to the accompanying drawings, it is clear that the in-<br>
vention is not restricted thereto but it can be modified in several ways within<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
