				<td>Filter assembly and process for producing it<br>
The invention relates to a filter assembly through which a<br>
fluid can flow, and to a filter body for purifying an exhaustgas <br>
stream from an internal combustion engine constructed<br>
using the filter assembly according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention describes a process for producing a<br>
filter assembly.<br>
If new vehicle registrations in Germany are considered, it<br>
will be found that in 2000 around one third of all newly<br>
registered vehicles have diesel engines. By tradition, this<br>
percentage is significantly higher than in, for example,<br>
France and Austria. This increased interest in diesel vehicles<br>
stems, for example, from the relatively low fuel consumption,<br>
the currently relatively low prices of diesel fuel, but also<br>
from the improved driving properties of vehicles of this type.<br>
A diesel vehicle is also very attractive from environmental<br>
aspects, since it has a significantly reduced emission of CO2<br>
compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. However, it should be<br>
noted that the level of soot particulates produced during<br>
combustion is well above that of gasoline-powered vehicles.<br>
If the purification of exhaust gases, in particular of diesel<br>
engines, is considered, it is possible for hydrocarbons (HC)<br>
and carbon monoxide (CO) in the exhaust gas to be oxidized in<br>
a known way by, for example, being brought into contact with a<br>
catalytically active surface. However, it is more difficult to<br>
reduce nitrogen oxides (NOX) under oxygen-rich conditions. A<br>
three-way catalytic converter, as is used, for example, in<br>
spark-ignition engines, does not provide the desired effects.<br>
For this reason, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR)<br>
process has been developed. Furthermore, N0x adsorbers have<br>
been tested for use for the reduction of nitrogen oxides.<br>
Discussions have long been ongoing as to whether particulates<br>
or long-chain hydrocarbons have an adverse effect on human<br>
health, but to date no definitive verdict has been reached.<br>
Irrespective of this, it is clearly desirable that emissions<br>
of this nature should not be released to the environment above<br>
a certain tolerance range. In this respect, the question<br>
arises as to what filtering efficiency is actually required in<br>
order to be able to comply with the well known statutory<br>
guidelines even in the future. If current exhaust emissions<br>
from commercially available vehicles in the Federal Republic<br>
of Germany are considered, it can be concluded that most<br>
passenger automobiles certified under EU III in 1999 are also<br>
able to satisfy the requirements of EU IV if they are equipped<br>
with a filter with an efficiency of at least 30 to 40%.<br>
To reduce the levels of particulate emissions, it is known to<br>
use particulate traps which are constructed from a ceramic<br>
substrate. They have passages, so that the exhaust gas which<br>
is to be purified can flow into the particulate trap. The<br>
adjacent passages are alternately closed off, so that the<br>
exhaust gas enters the passage on the inlet side, passes<br>
through the ceramic wall and escapes again through the<br>
adjacent passage on the outlet side. Filters of this type<br>
achieve an efficiency of approx. 95% over the entire range of<br>
particulate sizes which occur.<br>
In addition to chemical interactions with additives and<br>
special coatings, the reliable regeneration of the filter in<br>
the exhaust system of an automobile still constitutes a<br>
problem. It is necessary to regenerate the particulates trap,<br>
since the increasing accumulation of particulates in the<br>
passage wall through which the gas is to flow leads to a<br>
constantly increasing pressure loss which has adverse effects<br>
on engine performance. The regeneration substantially<br>
comprises brief heating of the particulates trap and the<br>
particulates which have accumulated therein, so that the soot<br>
particulates are converted into gaseous constituents. However,<br>
this high thermal loading of the particulates trap has adverse<br>
effects on the service life.<br>
To avoid this discontinuous regeneration, which is a major<br>
factor in promoting thermally induced wear, a system for the<br>
continuous regeneration of filters has been developed (CRT:<br>
continuous regeneration trap). In a system of this type, the<br>
particulates are burnt by means of oxidation with NO2 at<br>
temperatures which are already over 200Â°C. The NO2 which is<br>
required for this purpose is often generated by an oxidation<br>
catalytic converter arranged upstream of the particulates<br>
trap. However, in particular for use in motor vehicles using<br>
diesel fuel, this gives rise to the problem that there is only<br>
an insufficient level of nitrogen monoxide (NO) which can be<br>
converted into the desired nitrogen dioxide (N02) in the<br>
exhaust gas. Consequently, it has not hitherto been possible<br>
to ensure that continuous regeneration of the particulates<br>
trap in the exhaust system will occur.<br>
Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that, in addition to<br>
non-convertible particulates, oil or additional residues of<br>
additives also accumulate in a particulates trap and cannot<br>
readily be regenerated. For this reason, known filters have to<br>
be replaced and/or washed at regular intervals. Filter systems<br>
of plate-like structure attempt to solve this problem by<br>
allowing vibration-like excitation which leads to these<br>
constituents being removed from the filter. However, this<br>
means that the non-regeneratable fraction of the particulates<br>
in some cases passes directly into the environment without any<br>
further treatment.<br>
In addition to a minimum reaction temperature and a specific<br>
residence time, it is necessary to provide sufficient nitrogen<br>
oxide for the continuous regeneration of particulates using<br>
NO2. Tests relating to the dynamic emission of nitrogen<br>
monoxide (NO) and particulates have clearly demonstrated that<br>
the particulates are emitted in particular when there is no or<br>
only a very small amount of nitrogen monoxide in the exhaust<br>
gas, and vice versa. What this means is that a filter with<br>
true continuous regeneration substantially has to function as<br>
a compensator or store, so that it is ensured that the two<br>
reaction partners are present in the filter in the required<br>
quantities at a given instant. Furthermore, the filter is to<br>
be arranged as close as possible to the internal combustion<br>
engine in order to be able to reach temperatures which are as<br>
high as possible immediately after a cold start. To provide<br>
the required nitrogen dioxide, an oxidation catalytic<br>
converter is to be connected upstream of the filter, so as to<br>
react carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) and in<br>
particular also to convert nitrogen monoxide (NO) into<br>
nitrogen dioxide (N02) . If this system comprising oxidation<br>
catalytic converter and filter is arranged close to the<br>
engine, a suitable position is in particular upstream of a<br>
turbocharger which is often used in diesel motor vehicles to<br>
increase the boost pressure in the combustion chamber.<br>
If these basic considerations are looked at, the question<br>
arises, for actual deployment in automotive engineering, as to<br>
how a filter of this type, which in such a position and in the<br>
presence of extremely high thermal and dynamic loads has a<br>
satisfactory filtering efficiency, is constructed. In this<br>
context, account should be taken in particular of the spatial<br>
conditions, which require a new design of filters. Whereas the<br>
maximum possible volume was to the fore in the case of<br>
conventional filters, which were arranged in the underbody of<br>
a motor vehicle, in order to ensure a long residence time of<br>
the as yet unreacted particulates in the filter and therefore<br>
a high efficiency, if the filters are arranged close to the<br>
engine, there is not sufficient space or room available.<br>
For this purpose, a new concept has been developed, mainly<br>
referred to by the term "open filter system" . These open<br>
filter systems are distinguished by the fact that there is no<br>
need for the filter passages to be alternately closed off by<br>
structural means. In this context, it is provided that the<br>
passage walls be constructed at least in part from porous or<br>
highly porous material and that the flow passages of the open<br>
filter have diverting or guiding structures. These internal<br>
fittings cause the flow and the particulates contained therein<br>
to be diverted toward the regions made from porous or highly<br>
porous material. Surprisingly, it has emerged that the<br>
particulates, as a result of being intercepted and/or<br>
impacting, are retained on and/or in the porous passage wall.<br>
The pressure differences in the flow profile of the flowing<br>
exhaust gas are of importance to this effect occurring. The<br>
diversion additionally makes it possible to produce local<br>
reduced pressure or excess pressure conditions, leading to a<br>
filtration effect through the porous wall, since the<br>
abovementioned pressure differences have to be compensated<br>
for.<br>
The particulate trap, unlike the known closed screen or filter<br>
systems, is open, since there are no flow blind alleys. This<br>
property can therefore also be used to characterize<br>
particulate filters of this type, so that, for example, the<br>
"freedom of flow" parameter is suitable for describing the<br>
systems. By way of example, a "freedom of flow" of 20% means<br>
that, when viewed in cross section, it is possible to see<br>
through approx. 20% of the surface area. In the case of a<br>
particulate filter with a passage density of approx. 600 cpsi<br>
(cells per square inch) with a hydraulic diameter of 0.8 mm,<br>
this freedom of flow would correspond to an area of over 0.1<br>
mm2.<br>
To realize an open filter system of this nature, it is also an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a filter material<br>
which is particularly suitable in particular for use in the<br>
context of continuous regeneration, with the resulting<br>
demands. In this respect, the filter system has to be able to<br>
withstand the high thermal and dynamic loads in the exhaust<br>
system of a passenger automobile, which stem from the pulsed<br>
emission of very hot exhaust gas. Furthermore, it is intended<br>
to provide a corresponding filter body which is suitable for<br>
significantly reducing the levels of particulates in the<br>
exhaust system. In addition, it is intended to provide a<br>
process for producing the filter material.<br>
These objects are achieved by a filter assembly having the<br>
features of patent claim 1, a filter body for purifying an<br>
exhaust-gas stream from an internal combustion engine having<br>
the features of patent claim 12, and a process for producing a<br>
filter assembly in accordance with the features of patent<br>
claim 14. Further advantageous configurations are described in<br>
the respective dependent claims, in which context the<br>
particular features may occur individually or in any desired<br>
and appropriate combination.<br>
A fluid can flow through the filter assembly according to the<br>
invention, and this filter assembly comprises at least one<br>
covering layer made from at least partially porous or highly<br>
porous material, and at least one fiber layer made from a<br>
fiber fabric. Moreover, the covering layer has at least one<br>
boundary region. The filter assembly is distinguished by the<br>
fact that the at least one covering layer forms a sleeve which<br>
surrounds the fiber layer, so that the fiber layer is arranged<br>
captively inside the at least one covering layer. In this<br>
context, a sleeve is to be understood as meaning an<br>
arrangement of the at least one covering layer in which the at<br>
least one covering layer also, at least in part, extends<br>
beyond the periphery of the fiber layer, in particular<br>
completely surrounds the fiber layer. In this respect, at<br>
least in part a sleeve is formed over the entire periphery of<br>
the fiber layer. This arrangement whereby the covering layer<br>
engages around the periphery of the fiber layer accordingly<br>
means that a relative movement of the fiber layer with respect<br>
to the at least one covering layer is impeded in a positively<br>
locking manner in at least one direction.<br>
The design of a filter assembly of this type combines a number<br>
of advantages which are of importance in particular for the<br>
arrangement of a filter assembly of this type close to the<br>
engine. The at least one covering layer constitutes a type of<br>
protective sleeve which protects the inner fiber layer from<br>
the pressure shocks and temperature peaks which occur. The<br>
fiber layer represents a significantly looser assembly of<br>
fibers than the covering layer. In this context, it should be<br>
noted that the term "fiber fabric" encompasses all conceivable<br>
arrangements of fibers in bonded assemblies, knitted fabrics<br>
or the like. There are also numerous possible alternatives for<br>
the material, such as for example ceramic fibers, metal<br>
fibers, sintered materials or the like. The fiber layer may<br>
have a very high porosity, since the presence of a protective<br>
covering layer means that it does not have to be designed<br>
primarily for strength. In particular, it is possible to<br>
realize particularly large free spaces, pores or the like in<br>
the fiber layer. This is boosted in particular by the fact<br>
that the at least one covering layer is constructed in a form<br>
similar to a strip or sheet, i.e. offers a relatively large<br>
bearing surface area. Consequently, in this case it is<br>
possible to use fiber materials which are packed significantly<br>
more loosely than, for example, in known wire meshes which<br>
have hitherto been used to ensure the dimensional stability of<br>
the filter layers.<br>
Since then, sandwich structures of this type have been<br>
designed in such a way that there is in each case one<br>
supporting structure arranged on both sides of the filter<br>
material (in particular braided wire fabrics), and this<br>
sandwich has then been bent or deformed into the desired<br>
shape. These sandwich structures have been arranged in the<br>
exhaust-gas stream in such a way that the periphery (or end<br>
face) of the filter material was exposed to the pulsating<br>
exhaust-gas stream without protection. This led to detachment<br>
phenomena in particular in chese end regions. To ensure that<br>
the fiber material is fixed between the wire fabrics for a<br>
prolonged period of time, this sandwich structure had to be<br>
pressed together under a high pressure, which, on account of<br>
the resultant very small pores or free spaces, led to the<br>
accumulation of particulates, with noticeable adverse effects<br>
on the efficiency of the filter material. This is avoided in a<br>
simple way in the filter assembly according to the invention,<br>
since the fact that the at least one covering layer engages<br>
around the periphery of the fiber layer means that the fiber<br>
layer is arranged captively in the interior.<br>
According to a further configuration, the sleeve which<br>
protects the fiber layer is formed from a covering layer, the<br>
latter having at least one boundary region and an opposite<br>
deformation region, and the covering layer being connected to<br>
itself by joining in the at least one boundary region.<br>
Consequently, the dimensions of the covering layer allow the<br>
covering layer to be arranged around the fiber layer once,<br>
with the covering layer being deformed (bent, folded or the<br>
like) in the vicinity of a periphery of the fiber layer and<br>
being soldered or welded onto itself, for example, on the<br>
opposite side in a boundary region. The arrangement of a<br>
filter assembly of this type in the exhaust-gas stream from an<br>
internal combustion engine is preferably such that the exhaust<br>
gas which flows onto the filter assembly strikes either the<br>
boundary region with the connection by joining or the<br>
deformation region. Consequently, an offset or relative<br>
movement of the fiber layer with respect to the covering layer<br>
as seen in the direction of flow of the exhaust gas is not<br>
possible, since a positively locking barrier is formed here.<br>
In a direction perpendicular to this, the filter assembly can<br>
make do without the covering layer engaging around it, since<br>
the forces which are active here are relatively low. Rather,<br>
this ensures, for example, that the different thermal<br>
expansion coefficients of covering layer and fiber layer can<br>
be compensated for.<br>
As an alternative, it is also proposed that the sleeve be<br>
formed with at least two covering layers, in which case the<br>
covering layers are connected to one another by joining in at<br>
least one boundary region, and the fiber layer is arranged<br>
captively between these interconnected covering layers.<br>
Accordingly, what is described here is a sandwich structure in<br>
which the fiber layer is arranged between at least two<br>
covering layers. The sleeve is in this case produced by the<br>
externally arranged covering layers each having boundary<br>
regions which overlap the fiber layer and are connected to one<br>
another by joining (soldering, welding, sintering, adhesive<br>
bonding) . These boundary regions in each case lie in the<br>
vicinity of two opposite edges of the covering layer. Even if<br>
in this context it is preferable for the boundary region with<br>
the connection by joining to be arranged substantially outside<br>
the region with the fiber layer, it may under certain<br>
circumstances also be appropriate for one of the two covering<br>
layers to be of elongated design, so that it engages around a<br>
periphery of the fiber layer and is connected to the further<br>
covering layer in the region of the fiber layer. Forming a<br>
protective sleeve in this way likewise contributes to the<br>
fiber layer being arranged captively in the interior.<br>
According to a further configuration, the at least one<br>
covering layer, in at least one boundary region, has a reduced<br>
porosity with respect to the remaining region, in particular<br>
has no porosity whatsoever there. This means that the covering<br>
layer has at least two different permeabilities with respect<br>
to an exhaust gas. Whereas the covering layer has a relatively<br>
high permeability or porosity in particular in the region of<br>
contact with the fiber layer, on account of bores, holes,<br>
openings, apertures or the like, in the boundary region it is<br>
preferably made from a material which is substantially<br>
impervious to a fluid. This applies in particular to the<br>
additional material which is used to form the connection by<br>
joining, in particular solder or welding material. This allows<br>
the covering layers which are to be connected to one another<br>
to be permanently attached even in a highly corrosive<br>
environment, as is encountered in an exhaust system.<br>
According to a further configuration, the at least one<br>
covering layer is a metal foil with a thickness of less than<br>
0.04 mm, in particular less than 0.03 mm or even less than<br>
0.02 mm. Making the covering layer from a metal foil has<br>
particular advantages. For example, rapid heat conduction from<br>
that surface of the covering layer which is in contact with<br>
the exhaust gas to the fiber material is possible, so that in<br>
this case too rapid regeneration of trapped and/or accumulated<br>
particulates is possible (for example after the internal<br>
combustion engine has started up). Furthermore, the proposed<br>
thickness ensures that the metal foil has only a very low<br>
surface area-specific heat capacity, so that in this case too<br>
the light-off performance and/or the rapid heating to the<br>
required minimum temperature for regeneration of soot<br>
particulates is boosted. Moreover, when selecting the specific<br>
material for a metal foil of this type, it is possible to<br>
exploit knowledge which has already been gained in connection<br>
with the development of metallic honeycomb bodies as catalyst<br>
support bodies arranged close to the engine.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration, the filter<br>
assembly has a mean porosity of greater than 7 0%, in<br>
particular even greater than 90%. The mean porosity<br>
substantially relates to the region which is actually porous,<br>
i.e. discounting boundary regions of reduced porosity. By its<br>
very nature, the fiber layer often has a porosity which is<br>
well over 70% or 90%, and consequently a certain reduction is<br>
brought about by the covering layer which delimits the fiber<br>
layer. The porosity of the covering layer is defined, for<br>
example, by the size and/or number of the apertures, openings<br>
or the like. For example, it is conceivable for the covering<br>
layer to be provided with relatively large openings (e.g. with<br>
a diameter in the range from 2 to 6 mm), in which case a<br>
relatively small number of openings are provided per unit<br>
area. If, for example, pressure differences across the filter<br>
assembly play only a subordinate role, it is also possible for<br>
openings of this type to be made significantly smaller<br>
(significantly less than 1 mm) but to be provided in large<br>
numbers per unit area. The particular configuration which<br>
leads to the desired porosity depends on a large number of<br>
parameters; in this context: mention may be made, by way of<br>
example, of the composition of the exhaust gas (particulate<br>
size, pressure fluctuations, etc.), the fiber material used<br>
and/or the strength properties of the covering layer.<br>
According to yet a further configuration, the at least one<br>
boundary region extends from an edge of the covering layer<br>
over a boundary width which amounts to between 3 mm and 15 mm,<br>
with the boundary region preferably being arranged at least at<br>
two opposite edges. This boundary width ensures that the<br>
adjacent covering layers are durably attached to one another.<br>
The given range is adapted in particular for known soldering<br>
processes or, for example, roller seam welding. In this<br>
context, it should also be noted that it is possible for the<br>
fiber material to be completely sheathed or encapsulated, in<br>
which case a soldered joint or weld seam is formed all the way<br>
around the edges of the covering layers.<br>
As has already been mentioned above, it is particularly<br>
advantageous for the connection by joining to be carried out<br>
by means of a solder. Solder has proven eminently suitable for<br>
the formation of particularly corrosion-resistant and<br>
temperature-resistant connections in the production of<br>
catalyst support bodies from metal foils. However, under<br>
certain circumstances it is also possible to use various known<br>
welding processes, sintering or adhesive bonding techniques.<br>
According to a refinement, the fiber layer has a first length<br>
and a first width, and the at least one covering layer has a<br>
second length and a second width, with the first length and/or<br>
the first width of the fiber layer being less than the second<br>
length and/or second width of the at least one covering layer.<br>
This means that, if the covering and fiber layers are arranged<br>
concentrically, the covering layers, at least in part, extend<br>
beyond the peripheries of the fiber layer. This leads to the<br>
formation of overlap sections which are preferably used to<br>
form the connection by joining (boundary region).<br>
With regard to the fiber layer, it is proposed that the latter<br>
has a dimension of from 0.01 mm to 1 mm. In this context, it<br>
is preferable to use fiber layers which have an inherent<br>
porosity of over 85%. Tests carried out using fibers which<br>
have a diameter of between 0.008 mm and 0.015 mm have proven<br>
to have particularly satisfactory results with regard to the<br>
filtration action.<br>
In particular in connection with a filter assembly of this<br>
type having what is known as the open filter, to boost the<br>
flow diversion it is proposed that at least one covering layer<br>
has at least one flow-guiding surface. This is to be<br>
understood as meaning that the covering layer is not<br>
completely planar, but rather its surface forms a structure or<br>
microstructure which provides surfaces for diverting the flow.<br>
For example, a structure running transversely with respect to<br>
the direction of flow of the exhaust gas is advantageous;<br>
under certain circumstances, a structure height of a few<br>
millimeters (less than 2 mm, in particular less than 1 mm) is<br>
sufficient. These flow-guiding surfaces contribute to having a<br>
targeted influence on the direction of flow, with the result<br>
that the overall filter efficiency is improved.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a filter body which<br>
can be used to purify an exhaust-gas stream from an internal<br>
combustion engine. This filter body includes at least one<br>
filter assembly as described above, which is at least<br>
partially arranged in a casing, in such a way that passages,<br>
in particular corresponding to a honeycomb structure, are<br>
formed, with the passages preferably being at least partially<br>
narrowed. This means that the proposed filter assembly is<br>
suitable both for use in filter systems with alternately<br>
closed passages and for the production of open filter bodies<br>
in which it is possible to see through more than 20%, in<br>
particular more than 40%.<br>
With regard to an open filter body, it is possible, for<br>
example, for the filter body to be constructed from corrugated<br>
sheet-metal foils and substantially smooth filter assemblies,<br>
which are first of all stacked alternately on top of one<br>
another and then coiled and/or wound together. The corrugated<br>
sheet-metal foil in this case has diverting structures which<br>
at least partially divert the exhaust gas flowing through the<br>
filter body toward the porous filter assembly. This results in<br>
the exhaust gas at least partially flowing through the filter<br>
assembly, with in particular particulates of a size of between<br>
20 and 200 ran being filtered out in the process. Depending on<br>
how frequently a partial stream of gas is guided through a<br>
wall of filter assembly material of this type with the aid of<br>
diverting devices of this type, an increasing filtration<br>
effect is observed as the gas flows axially through the filter<br>
body.<br>
According to a further configuration of the filter body, at<br>
least one covering layer, at least in part, has being a<br>
structure which substantially delimits the passages. In other<br>
words, the structure substantially defines the cross section<br>
of flow of the passage. It is advantageous for the covering<br>
layers and/or the fiber layer together to be provided with a<br>
structure of this type, and in this context a corrugation is<br>
particularly recommended.<br>
The process for producing a filter assembly according to the<br>
invention, as described above, according to a further aspect<br>
of the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
- forming a porosity in at least one covering layer, with at<br>
least one boundary region being left out,<br>
- arranging a fiber layer on a covering layer,<br>
- forming a sleeve using the at least one covering layer, and<br>
- forming a connection by joining in the at least one<br>
boundary region, so that the fiber layer is fixed captively<br>
within the at least one covering layer.<br>
The formation of a porosity in the covering layer may, for<br>
example, be generated even while the material for the covering<br>
layer is being produced. However, it is also possible for the<br>
porosity to be produced by retrospectively providing a fluid-<br>
impervious material with bores, openings, apertures or the<br>
like. In this case, it is possible in particular to use<br>
mechanical production processes (cutting, stamping, drilling<br>
or the like), etching processes or a heat treatment, in<br>
particular using a laser. All techniques which have been<br>
disclosed hitherto can be used to form the fiber layer, so<br>
that a knitted fabric, woven fabric or similar structure made<br>
from fiber-like material is formed.<br>
According to a refinement of the process, a sleeve is formed<br>
by deformation of a covering layer, in particular by means of<br>
bending, creasing or folding of the covering layer, in a<br>
deformation region. This process step is recommended in<br>
particular for the production of a filter assembly according<br>
to the invention which has just one covering layer. In this<br>
context, with a view to the high thermal and dynamic loads on<br>
the covering layer in use, it may be advantageous if the<br>
adjacent sections of a covering layer are additionally<br>
connected to one another by joining in the deformation region.<br>
This ensures that the fiber layer is still held captively even<br>
if the covering layer should happen to tear open in the region<br>
of the bend.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that a sleeve be formed by means<br>
of two covering layers, in which case the at least one fiber<br>
layer is arranged between the covering layers in such a way<br>
that the boundary regions of the covering layers are at least<br>
in part directly superimposed on one another. This means that<br>
there is no fiber material arranged between the adjacent<br>
boundary regions of the covering layers, and connection by<br>
joining in this boundary region does not cause any damage to<br>
the fiber layer. Moreover, it is ensured that the connection<br>
by joining in the boundary region is able to withstand the<br>
highly corrosive conditions in the exhaust system of the<br>
internal combustion engine for a very long period of time.<br>
According to a refinement of the process, before the fiber<br>
layer is arranged on the covering layer, a structure is<br>
introduced into at least one of the covering layers. If the<br>
filter assembly has two covering layers for forming a sleeve,<br>
it is advantageously proposed that the structure be introduced<br>
into the two covering layers successively in terms of time,<br>
and in each case a different structure be produced. By way of<br>
example, this makes it possible to form different passage<br>
densities over the cross section of the filter body, so that<br>
it is ensured that the respective cross-sectional shapes of<br>
the passages and/or passage densities are matched in a<br>
targeted fashion to the incoming flow profile of the exhaustgas <br>
stream.<br>
With regard to the configuration of the connection of the<br>
covering layers to one another by joining, as an alternative<br>
it is proposed that the connection by joining be carried out<br>
by means of a welding operation or by means of a soldering<br>
operation. These constitute particularly preferred<br>
configurations of the process; under certain circumstances,<br>
joining connections using sintering or adhesive bonding<br>
processes are also possible.<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process, the at<br>
least one covering layer is provided with a solder stop<br>
outside the at least one boundary region. The solder stop used<br>
may be known oils, paints, waxes, ceramic slips or the like<br>
which prevent the solder from penetrating into internal<br>
regions of the sleeve in which the fiber layer is arranged.<br>
This firstly ensures that the solder does not contribute to<br>
reducing the porosity of the fiber layer and secondly also<br>
ensures that the quantity of solder which has been calculated<br>
to be required for the solder connection is actually present<br>
at the location which is to be joined.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail on the<br>
basis of figures, which show particularly advantageous and<br>
particularly preferred configurations of the filter assembly<br>
and/or filter body. Furthermore, the figures serve to<br>
illustrate the described process according to the invention.<br>
Nevertheless, it should be noted at this point that the<br>
invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiments<br>
illustrated in the figures. In the drawing:<br>

embodiment of the filter assembly,<br>

the filter assembly,<br>

embodiment of the filter body according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic and perspective view of an<br>
embodiment of the filter assembly 1 according to the invention<br>
with two covering layers 2. The covering layers 2 are composed<br>
at least in part of a porous material (of. dotted region) and<br>
each have two boundary regions 3 on opposite sides.<br>
Furthermore, the filter assembly 1 comprises a fiber layer 4<br>
formed from a fiber fabric. The two covering layers 2 form a<br>
sleeve 31 which surrounds the fiber layer 4, so that the fiber<br>
layer 4 is arranged captively inside the two covering layers<br>
2. The two covering layers 2 are connected to one another by<br>
joining (connection 22), in particular are soldered or welded<br>
to one another, in the boundary regions 3 close to an edge 6.<br>
The fiber layer 4 has a first length 9 and a first width 10.<br>
The covering layers 2 in each case have a second length 11 and<br>
a second width 12; in the embodiment illustrated, these are<br>
equal (equal length and equal width). In principle, the second<br>
length 11 and the second width 12 of the covering layers 2<br>
used to form the filter assembly 1 and the sleeve 31 may also<br>
differ. The Fig. also shows that the covering layers 2 have a<br>
second length 11 which is greater than the first length 9 of<br>
the fiber layer 4. This means that the covering layers 2 overlap the fiber layer 4 in length, so that the boundary<br>
regions 3 can rest on top of one another. This makes it easier<br>
to form permanent connections 22.<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a sectional view through a<br>
further embodiment of a filter assembly 1, the latter having<br>
just one covering layer 2 which forms the sleeve 31. The<br>
covering layer 2 has at least one boundary region 3 and an<br>
opposite deformation region 32, the covering layer 2 being<br>
connected to itself by joining in the boundary region 3. The<br>
connection by joining is in this case ensured by means of a<br>
solder 8, with a solder stop 23 being provided outside the<br>
boundary region 3, preventing the solder 8 from reaching the<br>
vicinity of the fiber layer 4 during a heat treatment. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated, solder 8 is provided in the inside of<br>
the deformation region 32, and in this case too it is<br>
optionally possible to provide solder stop 23. The boundary<br>
region 3 extends from an edge 6 of the covering layer 2 over a<br>
boundary width 7 of preferably between 3 and 15 mm.<br>
With regard to the material thicknesses, it can be explained<br>
on the basis of Fig. 2, that the covering layer 2 is, for<br>
example, a metal foil and has a thickness 5 of less than 0.04<br>
mm. Furthermore, it can be seen that the fiber layer 4 has a<br>
dimension 13 which is preferably in the range from 0.01 mm to<br>
1 mm.<br>
Fig. 2 likewise shows a covering layer 2 which is provided<br>
with flow-guiding surfaces 15. This is designed in particular<br>
as a microstructure. In the embodiment illustrated, this<br>
microstructure or the flow-guiding surfaces fulfils two<br>
functions. Firstly, the exhaust gas which flows by (from a<br>
boundary region 3 to the deformation region 32 or vice versa)<br>
is diverted or swirled up, so that partial gas streams are<br>
diverted toward or penetrate through the adjacent porous wall,<br>
in particular a filter assembly according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, it can be seen that with a microstructure of this<br>
type it is also possible to effect a clamping action with<br>
respect to the inner fiber layer 4. This improves the<br>
stability of the filter assembly 1. Moreover, this enables the<br>
porosity of the covering layer 2 to be increased, since the<br>
clamping forces which are additionally introduced already<br>
sufficiently prevent any possible detachment phenomena in the<br>
fiber layer 4.<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts a detailed view of an<br>
embodiment of a filter body according to the invention. The<br>
filter body 16 is constructed from partitions 14, between<br>
which at least one filter assembly 1 is arranged. The filter<br>
assembly 1, like the partitions 14, is illustrated in section,<br>
with the two covering layers 2 once again forming a sleeve 31<br>
(not shown) around the fiber layer 4. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated, the filter assembly 1 has a structure 21 which<br>
substantially performs the function of spacing the smooth<br>
partitions 14 apart from one another and forming passages 19.<br>
The passage 19 has a cross-sectional area which is<br>
substantially defined by this structure 21 of the filter<br>
assembly 1.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a highly simplified detailed view of the excerpt<br>
from Fig. 3 which is indicated by IV. The fiber layer 4 is<br>
delimited by a covering layer 2. The covering layer 2 has a<br>
multiplicity of openings 24 with an opening diameter 25. The<br>
opening diameter 25 varies considerably depending on the<br>
particular application and is preferably in the range between<br>
2 and 6 mm. However, under certain circumstances it also<br>
conceivable for openings of this type to be designed with<br>
diameters of less than 1 mm or even 0.1 mm. As is likewise<br>
illustrated in highly simplified form, the fiber layer 4<br>
comprises a large number of fibers 33, which are arranged so<br>
as to form a knitted fabric, a woven fabric or the like,<br>
Alternatively, these may also be metal fibers, sintered<br>
materials or wire fabrics. In the embodiment illustrated,<br>
additional elements or constituents, in particular catalysts<br>
34, are integrated in the fiber layer 4, assisting the<br>
regeneration of accumulated soot particulates or the like even<br>
at low temperatures (for example between 200 and 300Â°C).<br>
Fig. 5 diagrammatically depicts the structure of an exhaust<br>
system 27 for an internal combustion engine 17 . An internal<br>
combustion engine 17 of this type is preferably designed as a<br>
diesel engine. In the direction of flow 35 of the exhaust gas,<br>
the exhaust system 27 comprises the following components:<br>
- an upstream oxidation catalytic converter 40,<br>
- a filter body 16 according to the invention,<br>
- a turbocharger 39, and<br>
- a further catalytic converter 29.<br>
The individual components may be arranged in separate casings<br>
or may be partially combined with one another in a single<br>
casing, and are connected to one another via an exhaust pipe<br>
28. As has already been stated in the introduction, it is<br>
particularly advantageous for the filter body 16 to be<br>
arranged as close as possible to the internal combustion<br>
engine 17. A distance 26 from the internal combustion engine<br>
17 of less than 0.7 m, in particular even less than 30 cm, is<br>
particularly suitable in this respect. With the individual<br>
components arranged in this way, first of all a sufficient<br>
quantity of nitrogen dioxide is made available with the aid of<br>
the oxidation catalytic converter 40, ensuring (continuous)<br>
regeneration of the accumulated soot particulates in the<br>
filter body 16 arranged immediately downstream. The downstream<br>
catalytic converter 29 may, for example, also be designed as a<br>
hybrid converter, in which case it has partial regions with<br>
different heat capacities. In this context, it is to be<br>
designed in such a way that its heat capacity increases in the<br>
direction of flow.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a diagrammatic and perspective illustration of a<br>
further embodiment of the filter body 16 according to the<br>
invention. The filter body 16 in this case once again<br>
comprises partitions 14, between which there is in each case a<br>
filter assembly 1 according to the invention. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated, the filter assembly 1 is formed with<br>
two covering layers 2 and a fiber layer 4 arranged between<br>
them, although the connection by joining in the boundary<br>
region cannot be seen on account of the sectional<br>
illustration. The partitions 14 are in this case provided with<br>
a structure, whereas the filter assembly 1 has a substantially<br>
smooth surface. This structure of the partitions 14 forms<br>
passages 19 through which an exhaust gas can flow in a<br>
direction of flow 35. The partitions 14 in this case have<br>
different heights 30 of the structure, so that the passages 19<br>
which are formed are matched to the characteristics of the<br>
incoming flow of exhaust gas.<br>
The embodiment illustrated here substantially shows an open<br>
filter. This property is described by the fact that there is a<br>
freedom of flow of at least 20%. In this context, the term<br>
freedom of flow means that in any desired cross section it is<br>
possible to see through at least 20% of the area, i.e. at<br>
least 20% of the area is free of internal fittings, such as<br>
diverting surfaces 37 or the like. In other words, this also<br>
means that when a particulate filter of this type is viewed<br>
from the end side, it is possible to see through at least some<br>
of the passage, provided that the internal fittings are all in<br>
the same position, i.e. are arranged aligned one behind the<br>
other. This is typically the case with honeycomb bodies made<br>
from at least partially structured sheet-metal layers.<br>
However, the freedom of flow, in the case of internal fittings<br>
which are not aligned with one another, does not necessarily<br>
mean that it is actually possible to see through part of a<br>
honeycomb body of this type. The partitions 14 are provided<br>
with apertures 36 and diverting surfaces 37 which divert the<br>
exhaust-gas stream toward the filter assembly 1. This produces<br>
pressure differences which cause partial flows of exhaust gas<br>
to penetrate through the filter assembly 1, so that soot<br>
particulates or the like remain and accumulate in the fiber<br>
layer 4.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a slightly different configuration of a filter<br>
body according to the invention. In this case too, the<br>
passages 19 are substantially generated by a corresponding<br>
structure of the partitions 14. Furthermore, the partitions 14<br>
have diverting surfaces 37, which in the case illustrated<br>
close off the entire cross section of the passages 19. The<br>
result of this is that the direction of flow 35 of the exhaust<br>
gas is influenced in such a manner that the particulate-<br>
containing exhaust gas is guided through the filter assembly<br>
1. This configuration is mainly suitable for applications in<br>
which a pressure loss is not critical. In the case of mobile<br>
exhaust systems, according to current knowledge, it is<br>
preferable to use an open filter with passages 19 which are<br>
just constricted but are not closed off. Depending on the<br>
number of diverting surfaces 37 which the exhaust gas is to<br>
pass through and/or the flow through a filter assembly 1,<br>
ultimately substantially the entire exhaust-gas stream is<br>
filtered and purified even in the case of an open filter body<br>
16, as illustrated in Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a diagrammatic and perspective illustration of a<br>
configuration of the filter body 16 having a filter assembly 1<br>
and a partition 14, which are wound helically to form a<br>
honeycomb body and are arranged in a casing 18. The partition<br>
14 has a structure 21, so that passages 19, through which the<br>
exhaust gas can flow in a direction of flow 35, are formed.<br>
The exhaust gas enters the filter body 16 via an end side 20<br>
and, on account of the flow diversions in the interior of an<br>
open filter, adopts a flow path which is preferably longer<br>
than the extent of the passages 19 in the direction of the<br>
axis 38.<br>
The filter assembly described here and the filter body which<br>
it is used to construct is particularly suitable for<br>
installation close to the engine in mobile exhaust systems.<br>
The proposed filter assembly is able to permanently withstand<br>
the high pressure loads which occur there on account of the<br>
proximity to the combustion chamber and the high temperatures<br>
of up to 700Â°C, and from time to time even up to 1000Â°C, since<br>
the fiber layer is at least partially surrounded, in a<br>
positively locking manner, by a protective sleeve formed by at<br>
least one covering layer. This prevents the fiber layer from<br>
exhibiting detachment phenomena after even just a short time.<br>
The proposed process is very simple and can be carried out<br>
reliably and without major technical difficulties even in<br>
large-series production, as is customary for automotive<br>
engineering.<br>

Dated this 27th day of May, 2004<br>
This invention relates to a fitter assembly (1), through which a fluid can flow and<br>
which comprises at least one covering layer (2) formed of an at least partially<br>
porous material having at least one boundary region (3), and at least one fiber<br>
layer (4) made from a fiber fabric, characterized in that the at least one covering<br>
