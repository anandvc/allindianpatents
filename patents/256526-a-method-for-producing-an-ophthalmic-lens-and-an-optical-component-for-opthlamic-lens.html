METHOD FOR PRODUCING AN OPHTHALMIC LENS AND OPTICAL<br>
COMPONENT SUITABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING SAID METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
producing an ophthalmic lens, and an optical component<br>
suitable for implementing said method.<br>
Ophthalmic lens here means any optical component<br>
made from mineral and/or organic material, at least<br>
partially transparent and suitable for being placed<br>
before a wearer's eye, regardless of the optical<br>
function of said component. It may in particular have<br>
an antiglare protective function by absorption of part<br>
of the light, called antisolar function, a contrast<br>
reinforcing function by coloration or by polarization<br>
filtering, an ametropia correcting function, etc. It<br>
may in particular be an afocal, unifocal, bifocal,<br>
multifocal or progressive lens.<br>
Ametropia correcting lenses are conventionally<br>
produced by forming a transparent material with a<br>
refractive index higher than air. The shape of the<br>
lenses is selected so that the refraction at the<br>
interfaces between the material and the air causes<br>
appropriate focusing of the light on the wearer's<br>
retina. The lens is generally cut out to be fit into a<br>
frame, with an appropriate positioning with regard to<br>
the pupil of the corrected eye.<br>
In certain distribution circuits, blanks of<br>
corrective lenses that are manufactured industrially<br>
are finished to adapt them to the ametropia of an eye<br>
to be corrected. The finish consists for example in<br>
machining and polishing the back of the blank. This<br>
method combines the industrial production of the<br>
blanks, thereby reducing their cost, and the need to<br>
personalize the correction. However, the reshaping of<br>
lenses according to the wearer's needs requires<br>
specialized tools and skills. These must be available<br>
close to the place of distribution to satisfy the<br><br>
current desire for rapid delivery of the lenses. This<br>
creates a strong need for investment and organization.<br>
In the case of optical functions other than<br>
ametropia correction, the personalization possibilities<br>
are highly restricted. The wearer is generally offered<br>
a choice among a small number of lens colors, degrees<br>
of light absorption, sometimes polarizations, which<br>
correspond to lens models or blanks available ex-works.<br>
It is conceivable to increase the number of<br>
possibilities offered, but this would be to the<br>
detriment of the unit production cost. The<br>
possibilities of varying an absorption or coloration<br>
parameter along the lens surface are even more limited,<br>
and in any case are not appropriate to the individual<br>
needs or desiderata of the wearers.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to<br>
propose a method for producing ophthalmic lenses which<br>
offers great flexibility of adaptation to the<br>
individual cases of wearers.<br>
For this purpose, the invention proposes a<br>
method for producing an ophthalmic lens having at least<br>
one optical function, comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	producing an optical component incorporating at<br>
least one active material distributed parallel to a<br>
surface of the component, the active material having an<br>
irradiation-modifiable optical property; and<br>
b)	selectively irradiating portions of the active<br>
material along the component surface to obtain the<br>
optical function by modulating said property from one<br>
portion to another, said portions having dimensions<br>
smaller than 1 mm.<br>
In the inventive method, step a) for producing<br>
the optical component may be independent of or slightly<br>
dependent on the quantitative aspects of the optical<br>
function of the lens. It is therefore common to the<br>
production of lenses of various types. The industrial<br>
facilities used for this step accordingly serve to<br>
produce a very large number of components, thus leading<br><br>
to reduce the unit cost of each component thereby<br>
produced.<br>
Step b) serves to program the optical function<br>
of the lens. This programming is carried out by<br>
inscribing the optical function in the optical<br>
component, by irradiating portions of the active<br>
material. A differentiation is thereby obtained between<br>
the lenses, which serves to produce a line of<br>
diversified lenses, covering a wide range of degrees of<br>
completion of the optical function, and optionally, of<br>
optical functions of different types. In particular,<br>
the optical function of an ophthalmic lens obtained by<br>
the inventive method may comprise an antisolar effect<br>
and/or an ametropia correction.<br>
Thanks to the invention, the customisation of<br>
the ophthalmic lenses is delayed in the progress of the<br>
lens production process. This causes more efficient<br>
manufacture and more economical inventory control. This<br>
is because step a) for producing the optical components<br>
can be carried out centrally in relatively large<br>
capacity industrial units and step b) of irradiation to<br>
program the optical function of each lens can be<br>
carried out by the distributor, according to the<br>
desiderata and/or the ametropia characteristics of each<br>
client. It is then sufficient for the distributor to<br>
have only a reserve stock of optical components of a<br>
single model or of a limited number of models, thereby<br>
simplifying his inventory control.<br>
The inscription of the optical function is<br>
obtained by modulating the optical property between<br>
portions of active material whereof the dimensions<br>
parallel to the surface of the optical component are<br>
smaller than 1 mm. Each portion therefore constitutes a<br>
pixel to which a value of the optical property is<br>
attributed.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, the optical<br>
function is brought to the lens in pixelized form. For<br>
this purpose, the optical function is defined according<br><br>
to variable levels of an optical property evaluated at<br>
pixels distributed in parallel to the surface of the<br>
optical component. Each pixel individually modifies the<br>
light incident on this pixel according to the<br>
corresponding level of the optical property set during<br>
the irradiation. The optical function of the lens<br>
thereby results from the combination of the elementary<br>
contributions of all the pixels with the modification<br>
of the light passing through the lens. Thanks to this<br>
pixelization of the optical function, the optical<br>
function can be inscribed in the lens rapidly, simply<br>
and accurately.<br>
The high accuracy according to which the<br>
optical function can be defined in the irradiation step<br>
b) is a further advantage of the invention. In<br>
particular, an ametropia correction inscribed in the<br>
optical component according to the inventive method can<br>
be adapted exactly to the degree of ametropia to be<br>
corrected. This can eliminate the need for the<br>
subsequent finishing of the lens surfaces by mechanical<br>
means according to the degree of ametropia of a<br>
particular client.<br>
The modifiable optical property of the active<br>
material may be of various types. To obtain a sunlens,<br>
the modifiable optical property may comprise a light<br>
absorption by the active material or a color thereof.<br>
Thus, a more or less dark or variable color lens can be<br>
obtained by using irradiation characteristics adapted<br>
for imparting the desired level of light absorption or<br>
the desired color to the active material.<br>
The modifiable optical property may also<br>
comprise a refringence of the active material. A light<br>
wave passing through one of the portions of the active<br>
material is then phase-shifted according to the optical<br>
path corresponding to the passage through this portion.<br>
The optical path is equal to the product of the<br>
thickness of the portion of active material and its<br>
refractive index. By appropriately setting the<br><br>
refractive index in each portion of the active material<br>
during irradiation step b), the phase, and consequently<br>
the vergence of the light wave exiting the lens, can be<br>
adapted to obtain a predefined ametropia correction.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the portions of the active material have<br>
dimensions of between 5 µm (microns) and 100 µm<br>
parallel to the surface of the lens component. The<br>
various pixels then cannot be discerned individually by<br>
the naked eye, and the lens has a continuous visual<br>
appearance. This produces an excellent visual comfort.<br>
Furthermore, no iridescence is perceptible, so that the<br>
lens raises no esthetic problems.<br>
A method for producing an ophthalmic lens<br>
according to the invention may further comprise the<br>
following step, carried out after step b):<br>
c) heating the optical component, to make the<br>
active material insensitive to another irradiation.<br>
The state of the active material, as resulting<br>
from the irradiation of step b) , is then definitively<br>
fixed during the heating. It can no longer be modified<br>
by another irradiation occurring during the use of the<br>
lens.<br>
The invention also relates to an optical<br>
component for ophthalmic lens, incorporating at least<br>
one active material distributed parallel to a surface<br>
of the component, the active material having an<br>
irradiation-modifiable optical property for obtaining a<br>
modulation of said property between portions of the<br>
active material having dimensions smaller than 1 mm.<br>
The modifiable optical property may comprise a light<br>
absorption and/or a refringence of the active material.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will appear from the description below of<br>
several nonlimiting exemplary embodiments, with<br>
reference to the drawings appended hereto, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an optical component suitable<br>
for implementing the invention;<br><br>
Figures 2a and 2b are respective cross sections<br>
of two optical components according to Figure<br>
1;<br>
Figure 3 shows the irradiation step of a method<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Figures 4a and 4b show two examples of<br>
distribution of portions of active material for<br>
optical components respectively according to<br>
Figures 2a and 2b;<br>
Figures 5a and 5b are two diagrams of variation<br>
of an optical parameter for ophthalmic lenses<br>
produced according to the invention; and<br>
Figure 6 shows an optical component suitable<br>
for a particular implementation of the<br>
invention.<br>
The optical component 10 shown in Figure 1 is a<br>
blank for spectacle lens. This blank may have a<br>
diameter of 6 cm, for example. In a manner known per<br>
se, the lens ready for assembly with a frame is<br>
obtained by trimming the blank 10 along a contour<br>
corresponding to the frame. This contour is shown by a<br>
dotted line in Figure 1.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b show two initial<br>
configurations of the optical component, which<br>
correspond to two different ways of defining the pixels<br>
of inscription of the optical function in the lens. In<br>
the case of a configuration according to Figure 2a, the<br>
pixels are not defined in the optical component before<br>
the irradiation stage. Conversely, an optical component<br>
having a configuration according to Figure 2b initially<br>
has pixels which are individually defined during the<br>
manufacture of the optical component, by their<br>
respective dimensions, their respective shape and their<br>
respective structure.<br>
According to a first configuration of the<br>
optical component (Figure 2a) , the active material is<br>
distributed in a substantially continuous layer in at<br>
least part of the component. The lens 10 blank<br><br>
therefore consists of a substrate 1 of transparent<br>
mineral or organic material, covered on one of its<br>
faces with a continuous layer of active material 2. The<br>
layer of active material 2 may have a uniform thickness<br>
e over the whole face of the substrate 1. Optionally,<br>
the layer 2 may itself be covered with at least one<br>
coating 3. Such a coating 3 may in particular have an<br>
antireflecting coating, a hard coating to impart<br>
improved scratch resistance to the lens, or a water-<br>
repellent coating. The layer of active material 2 and<br>
the coating 3 may be applied to the substrate 1 by one<br>
of the methods known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
According to the second configuration (Figure<br>
2b) , the active material is distributed in portions 4<br>
separated from one another and formed in at least part<br>
of the component. By way of example, the portions 4 are<br>
arranged on one of the faces of the substrate 1 which<br>
is of transparent material. They are adjacent to one<br>
another and form a mesh so as to cover the entire upper<br>
face of the substrate 1. The portions 4 can be formed<br>
directly in the substrate 1 or in a layer of additional<br>
material added onto the substrate 1. Each portion of<br>
active material 2 has a thickness e. A coating 3 may<br>
also be placed above the portions 4.<br>
Preferably, in the various possible<br>
configurations of the optical component, the thickness<br>
e of the active material 2 is greater than 10 µm in the<br>
component. The optical function resulting from the<br>
modulation of the optical property of the active<br>
material 2 may thereby have a high amplitude. As an<br>
example, in the case of the modulation of the<br>
absorption coefficient of the active material 2, very<br>
dark lenses can be obtained. This is because the<br>
thickness of the absorbing active material is<br>
sufficient to obtain a considerable reduction of the<br>
light intensity, in a proportion of up to 90% of the<br>
incident light, for example. The inventive method<br><br>
therefore enables to produce sunlenses procuring<br>
effective protection.<br>
Similarly, when the modulated optical property<br>
is the refringence of the active material, strong<br>
ametropia corrections can be obtained. This is because,<br>
since the variations in the optical path resulting from<br>
the modulation of the refractive index are proportional<br>
to the thickness of the active material, a thickness<br>
thereof of more than 10 µm enables to obtain wide<br>
variations of the optical path between various points<br>
of the lens surface.<br>
The irradiation of the active material 2 to<br>
inscribe the optical function in the lens 10 blank can<br>
be carried out in various ways. In particular, it can<br>
be carried out by exposing the active material 2 to an<br>
appropriate beam through a mask. Such a mask has zones<br>
essentially transparent to the beam, zones that are<br>
partially transparent and/or opaque zones. By selecting<br>
the quantity of beam energy received by each portion of<br>
the active material 2, the optical property is fixed in<br>
this portion at a predefined level. The quantity of<br>
beam energy received by each portion may be varied by<br>
changing the power of the beam and/or the exposure<br>
time.<br>
The beam used for irradiating the portions of<br>
active material may be of different types: a beam of<br>
electromagnetic radiation, in particular ultraviolet<br>
radiation, or an electron beam. Known irradiation<br>
sources can be used, selected according to the type of<br>
beam. Moreover, during irradiation, all the portions of<br>
the active material 2 may be exposed simultaneously, or<br>
certain portions of the active material 2 can be<br>
irradiated successively.<br>
Advantageously, the irradiation is controlled<br>
so that the optical property is modulated discretely<br>
according to a predefined set of values quantifying<br>
this property. Digital control of the irradiation can<br>
then be used, procuring great ease of programming. For<br><br>
the optical function of the lens to be definable very<br>
accurately, the predefined set of values preferably<br>
comprises at least ten distinct values.<br>
Figure 3 shows a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, which does not require the use of a mask for<br>
irradiation. The lens blank 10 can be one of the first<br>
or second configurations described above. Irradiation<br>
is carried out using a laser 100 producing a light beam<br>
101, for example ultraviolet light. The blank 10 is<br>
placed in front of the beam 101. The distance between<br>
the laser 100 and the blank 10 is adjusted so that the<br>
active material 2 is located at a point of convergence<br>
of the beam 101. The beam 101 is moved parallel to the<br>
surface of the blank 10 to irradiate different portions<br>
of the active material 2 during successive exposures.<br>
An inscription of the optical function is thereby<br>
obtained, with a high resolution parallel to the blank<br>
surface. When the blank 10 comprises a coating 3, this<br>
one must be transparent to the beam 101.<br>
The laser beam drive and positioning mechanisms<br>
during the inscription of the optical function may be<br>
of the type of those conventionally employed in optical<br>
compact disc etching machines. Using a computer file<br>
describing the quantification of the optical function<br>
to be provided, these mechanisms and the laser energy<br>
supply are controlled to carry out the desired<br>
modulation of the optical property of the active<br>
material between different pixels.<br>
When the active material 2 is initially<br>
distributed in a continuous layer in the blank 10, as<br>
shown in Figure 2a, the shape of the portions of the<br>
active material 2 which corresponds to different pixels<br>
is determined during the irradiation. If the<br>
irradiation is carried out through a mask, the pixels<br>
reproduce the motif of the mask. If the irradiation is<br>
carried out using a focused beam, the pixels correspond<br>
to the section of the beam in the layer of active<br>
material during successive exposures.<br><br>
Figure 4a shows one possible distribution of<br>
the pixels for a blank 10 having the configuration<br>
shown in Figure 2a. This distribution corresponds to a<br>
mesh by substantially circular pixels 5. p is the<br>
distance between 2 neighboring pixels, and corresponds<br>
to the elementary translation distance of the beam 101<br>
when irradiation is carried out according to Figure 3 .<br>
D is the diameter of each pixel 5, and substantially<br>
corresponds to the diameter of the laser beam 101 at<br>
the level of the active material 2.<br>
When the active material 2 is initially<br>
distributed in separate portions of the blank 10, as<br>
shown in Figure 2b, the irradiation conditions are<br>
adjusted so that each portion 4 of active material 2 is<br>
exposed to the radiation under same conditions. The<br>
modulation of the optical property is then based on the<br>
distribution and the shape of the portions as they<br>
exist before irradiation. According to Figure 4b, the<br>
portions 4 may each have a hexagonal shape of width D<br>
and two neighboring portions are separated by a wall of<br>
thickness d. The mesh pitch p is then equal to the sum<br>
of D and d.<br>
In general, the pitch p is preferably between<br>
5 µm and 100 µm. The lens accordingly has a uniform<br>
visual appearance devoid of iridescence. As an example,<br>
D may be equal to 20 µm and, for an implementation with<br>
initially separate portions of active material, d may<br>
be equal to 0.2 µm. The surface of the blank 10 then<br>
comprises a very large number of portions of the active<br>
material 2 forming pixels, in each of which the optical<br>
function is adjusted. As an example, more than one<br>
million pixels can be used.<br>
The mesh of the surface of the optical<br>
component by pixels can be of any shape whatever. In<br>
particular, the irradiated portions of the active<br>
material may be distributed in the component in a<br>
hexagonal mesh. Such a mesh allows for a high coverage<br>
rate of the surface of the optical component for<br><br>
numerous shapes of portions of active material. In<br>
particular, a hexagonal mesh is appropriate when the<br>
pixels are circular (Figure 4a) or hexagonal (Figure<br>
4b) .<br>
In certain cases, it may be advantageous to<br>
distribute the pixels in an irregular mesh. Undesirable<br>
diffraction effects can thereby be eliminated. Also in<br>
certain cases and according to the needs of the<br>
invention, the pixels may be square or rectangular. The<br>
various shapes of pixels may also be combined.<br>
The active material 2 may comprise a<br>
photoinitiator and/or a photopolymer. The<br>
photoinitiator and/or the photopolymer is sensitive to<br>
irradiation when this latter is carried out in<br>
appropriate conditions.<br>
Documents EP 1 225 458 and US 6 309 803<br>
describe an active material sensitive to ultraviolet<br>
light of wavelength 365 nm (nanometers) . Such active<br>
material can polymerize in two different phases, which<br>
are selected by the polymerization conditions applied<br>
to the optical component. The first phase corresponds<br>
to an organic polymerization network. It is formed when<br>
the active material is irradiated. The second phase<br>
corresponds to a mineral polymerization lattice and is<br>
formed when the active material is heated. The<br>
refractive index of the first phase is lower than that<br>
of the second phase.<br>
Such active material 2 can be deposited on the<br>
substrate 1 by dipping the substrate 1 in a solution of<br>
precursors. Such deposition process is commonly<br>
referred to as "dip-coating". The solution comprises<br>
two precursors capable of together forming an organic<br>
polymerization lattice or a mineral polymerization<br>
lattice. The two precursors are 3(trimethoxysilyl)<br>
propyl methacrylate and the product of the reaction<br>
between zirconium n-propoxide and methacrylic acid.<br>
Irgacure 1800, commercially available from supplier<br>
CIBA for example, is further added to the precursor<br><br>
solution. After dipping the substrate 1 in the<br>
precursor solution, the substrate 1 is heated to a<br>
temperature equal to 60°C or higher for about 3 0<br>
minutes. A dried layer of active material 2 is thereby<br>
obtained on the substrate 1.<br>
When a portion of the active material 2 thus<br>
obtained is irradiated with ultraviolet light of<br>
wavelength 365 nm, the organic polymerization lattice<br>
is formed, with a density that depends on the<br>
irradiation time and intensity. The substrate 1 is then<br>
heated to a temperature equal to 100°C or higher for 20<br>
to 45 minutes. The mineral polymerization lattice is<br>
then formed. In the portions of active material 2 which<br>
have not been previously irradiated, it creates a pure<br>
phase having a high refractive index. In the portions<br>
of active material 2 which have been previously<br>
irradiated, the mineral polymerization lattice is<br>
formed from quantities of precursors which have not<br>
been consumed by the organic polymerization.<br>
Intermediate refractive index values between the<br>
extreme values corresponding to the pure mineral<br>
lattice and the pure organic lattice are thereby<br>
obtained in the irradiated portions.<br>
On completion of the polymerization heating<br>
according to the mineral lattice, the two precursors<br>
are fully consumed. The active material 2 is then<br>
insensitive to another irradiation by ultraviolet light<br>
at the wavelength of 3 65 nm.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention,<br>
the irradiation is controlled so that the modulation of<br>
the optical property exhibits jumps between certain<br>
adjacent portions of the active material. Figure 5a<br>
shows an example of such variations for an active<br>
material 2 with modifiable refringence. The<br>
distribution of the refractive index only depends on<br>
the distance r between a point of the layer of active<br>
material 2 and the center of the blank 10. The distance<br>
r is plotted on the x-axis and the value of the<br><br>
refractive index n is plotted on the y-axis. The blank<br>
10 is divided into concentric rings Z1-Z4. The<br>
refractive index n varies progressively (continuously<br>
or by elementary jumps corresponding to the resolution<br>
of the index of the inscription system) within each of<br>
the rings Z1-Z4 between a minimum value, denoted nMIN and<br>
a maximum value, denoted nmax .At the borderline between<br>
two successive rings, the refractive index jumps from<br>
the value nmax to the value nMIN. The optical component<br>
thereby obtained has a divergent Fresnel lens function,<br>
while having a uniform thickness. A myopia corrective<br>
lens can thereby be obtained, which has an optical<br>
strength higher than those of lenses prepared according<br>
to the invention with a continuous variation of the<br>
refractive index over the entire surface of the blank.<br>
Figure 5b corresponds to Figure 5a for a<br>
hypermetropia corrective lens. The optical function<br>
obtained is that of a convergent Fresnel lens.<br>
In certain particular embodiments of the<br>
invention, the optical component incorporates a<br>
plurality of active materials selected so that one<br>
respective optical property of each active material can<br>
be modified selectively by irradiating the optical<br>
component. Each active material is distributed parallel<br>
to the component surface. A distinct optical function<br>
can then be inscribed in the optical component for each<br>
active material, by irradiating the component under<br>
appropriate conditions corresponding to each of the<br>
active materials. The overall optical function of the<br>
optical component thereby produced corresponds to the<br>
superimposition of the optical functions inscribed<br>
using each of the active materials. When the inscribed<br>
optical functions are of a cumulable type, the overall<br>
optical function may have a particularly high<br>
amplitude. As an example, if the inscription of each<br>
active material corresponds to a myopia corrective<br>
function, a lens adapted to a particularly high degree<br>
of myopia may be obtained.<br><br>
Advantageously, the active materials are<br>
distributed in respective layers superimposed within<br>
the optical component. The optical component can then<br>
be produced simply. In particular, the active materials<br>
may be deposited successively or added onto a<br>
substrate, using an appropriate deposition method for<br>
each of them. Figure 6 shows a lens 10 blank which<br>
comprises a substrate 1, with three different layers of<br>
active materials, referenced 2a-2c, superimposed on one<br>
face thereof.<br>
The irradiation conditions for selectively<br>
modifying the optical property of one of the active<br>
materials can be determined by at least one<br>
photoinitiator incorporated in each active material.<br>
The various active materials thereby advantageously<br>
contain respective photoinitiators which are sensitive<br>
to radiations of distinct wavelengths.<br>
It is understood in the context of the<br>
invention that the substrate 1 may have its own optical<br>
function. This optical function of the substrate 1 is<br>
accordingly superimposed or cumulates, with the optical<br>
function provided by the modulation of the optical<br>
property of the active material 2. For example, the<br>
substrate 1 may be of an absorbing material which<br>
imparts an antisolar function to the final lens, and<br>
the irradiation of the active material may impart an<br>
ametropia correcting function. A lens that is both<br>
antisolar and corrective is thereby obtained. The<br>
substrate 1 may also have its own correcting function,<br>
which may result in particular from a difference in<br>
thickness between the center and the periphery of the<br>
substrate 1. An additional optical function of<br>
ametropia correction provided by the modulation of the<br>
refringence of the active material 2 is then cumulated<br>
with the correction function of the substrate 1.<br>
Finally, although the invention has been<br>
described in detail for a spectacle lens, it is also<br>
understood that it can be applied identically to other<br><br>
ophthalmic elements such as, for example, a helmet<br>
visor, or a mask lens. This may, for example, be a<br>
motorcyclist or aircraft pilot helmet, or a diving or<br>
mountaineering mask.<br><br>
