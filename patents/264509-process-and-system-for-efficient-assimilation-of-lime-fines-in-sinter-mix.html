BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for efficient assimilation of lime fines in<br>
sinter mix and particularly, to a process for producing the sinter mix using -0-10<br>
mm lime fines in sinter mix and the sinter mix produced by means of the process.<br>
Lime addition to sintering is a well - established process worldwide. Lime<br>
improves sinter mix granulation, permeability and reduces the effect of moisture<br>
re-condensation. This helps improving vertical sintering speed and hence<br>
productivity of the sintering plant. In general, 0-3mm lime fines at the rate of 2-<br>
3% of sinter production are used in the sinter mix. The present invention has<br>
been developed and established for use of 0-10mm lime fines in sinter mix in<br>
Durgapur steel plant.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Production of sintered ore used as a raw material in iron making is generally<br>
performed in a preliminary process for a sintering raw material. This preliminary<br>
process includes steps of: mixing and granulation with raw material tanks and a<br>
drum mixer; and sintering with an ore feed hopper and a sintering machine. The<br>
sintering raw material is composed of: iron ore powder of about 10 mm or less in<br>
particle size; auxiliary materials, such as lime stone, quick lime, silica rock and<br>
serpentine; and solid fuel, such as coke, and components of the sintering raw<br>
material are stored in the raw material tanks. The components of the sintering<br>
raw material are charged into the drum mixer at a predetermined composition,<br>
then, a proper amount of water is added thereto and the components are mixed<br>
and granulated in the drum mixer (for example, a Dwight-Lloyd sintering<br><br>
machine) to a predetermined height by the ore feed hopper and solid fuel in a top<br>
surface section of the packed raw material is ignited. After the ignition, burning of<br>
the solid fuel is continued while the air is sucked downward and the sintering raw<br>
material is sintered by a combustion heat to form a sinter cake. This sinter cake<br>
is pulverized, followed by particle size adjustment to obtain a sintered ore product<br>
of 3 mm or more in particle size.<br>
Lime fines of size 0-3mm are used worldwide in all sintering process. No other<br>
sinter making process utilize lime fines of size greater than 3mm. Design<br>
modification as well process optimization were made to gainfully utilize lime fines<br>
of size greater than 3mm to improve sinter plant productivity.<br>
Japanese specification JP61177334 to NIPPON KOKAN KK discloses a method<br>
for TREATMENT OF SINTERING RAW MATERIAL.<br>
PURPOSE: To improve productivity without increasing cost, by separating<br>
, palletized pseudo particles to plural groups, and blending slaked lime and quick<br>
lime to the group having low strength after drying.<br>
CONSTITUTION: Pseudo particles obtained, by palletizing fine ores f1, fn are<br>
divided to brands flWfn having high strength after drying and brands fn+1, fn<br>
having low said strength to accumulate them at each yard. Mixed fines of each<br>
group are charged together with the other raw materials to blending vessels<br>
respectively. Thereat, slaked lime, quick lime or mixtures of these are blended to<br>
group of pseudo particles having low strength after drying. Each raw material in<br>
the vessels is qurried continuously, and sent to primary mixers respectively to<br>
palletize them while adding a suitable water quantity. Pelletized materials in the<br>
mixers are fed in a secondary mixer 6 to mix them and the mixture is treated by a<br>
sintering machine.<br><br>
Japanese specification JP04198427 to KAWASAKI STEEL CORP discloses a<br>
method for MANUFACTURE OF SINTERED ORE<br>
PURPOSE: To prevent the collapse of a minipellet and to improve the<br>
permeability of a sintering machine by pelletizing fine powder ore into a mini<br>
pellet, respectively feeding the above mini pellet and the other charging raw<br>
material, mixing them on a sloping plate and executing sintering.<br>
CONSTITUTION: Fine powder ore is conveyed from an ore tank by a belt<br>
conveyer and is pelletized by a pelletizing machine to manufacture a minipellet<br>
having 2 to 5mm grain size and 100 to 150g/5mm&amp;sime; ball collapsing strength.<br>
Iron ore, lime stone or the like as the other charging raw material are pelletized<br>
by the conventional process. The minipellet is run on a sloping plate and is mixed<br>
with the other charging raw material on the sloping plate, and sintering is<br>
executed. In this way, the greater part of minipellets manufactured by fine<br>
powder iron ore can be segregated in the lower layer part of a sintering machine.<br>
The permeability of the sintering machine is improved, and the productivity of<br>
minipellets is improved.<br>
Japanese specification JP61087828 to SUMITOMO METAL IND LTD discloses a<br>
method for MULTI-STAGE CHARGING METHOD OF SINTERING MATERIAL<br>
PURPOSE: To make possible the multi-stage charging of sintering materials<br>
having different grain sizes arid components to a sintering machine with a simple<br>
device and installation in the stage of supplying the sintering machine to a D.L.<br>
type sintering machine by providing a single charging system between a charging<br>
raw material tank and surge hoppers of the sintering machine.<br>
CONSTITUTION: Iron ore, lime, coke, returns, etc. having different grain sizes<br>
are stored into plural tanks in a sintering raw material supply source. The<br>
sintering raw materials A, B, C which are different in the compounding ratio of<br><br>
coke and grain sizes are fed out of the tank of the raw material supply source<br>
and are thoroughly mixed by a primary mixer and a secondary mixer. The mixed<br>
raw materials are conveyed by an endless conveyor toward an arrow direction<br>
and the above- mentioned compounded raw materials A, B, C are charged from<br>
the respective distributing ports of a distributor 8 into the surge hoppers of the<br>
sintering machine. The sintering raw materials A, B, C are successively<br>
laminated into a laminar state onto the endless belt of the machine from the<br>
hoppers and are ignited by an ignition furnace. The sintering raw materials are<br>
sintered thoroughly without the excess or deficient sintering of the metal and the<br>
excellent sintered ore is produced without the segregation of the sintering raw<br>
materials in the thickness direction and without uneven sintering.<br>
Japanese specification JP01230453 to SUMITOMO METAL IND LTD discloses a<br>
method for PRODUCTION OF QUICK LIME FOR SINTERING RAW MATERIAL<br>
PURPOSE: To prevent troubles of powdering and to obtain the title quick lime at<br>
low cost and in high yield, by blending limestone with pulverized coke having a<br>
given particle size and water, feeding the material to a preheater of rotary kiln,<br>
calcining without rotation, taking out the calcined material and transporting the<br>
calcined material by gas to a sintering process.<br>
CONSTITUTION: A drum washer is charged with limestone adjusted to<br>
4W15mm particle diameter from an ore storage tank and pulverized coke<br>
comprising &gt;90wt.% particles having &gt;1 mm particle.size from a coke tank, the<br>
lime stone and the coke are blended and 2W3% water is added to the blend.<br>
Then the blended materials are sent to a raw stone tank 4 before the furnace and<br>
sent through a surge hopper and a pH hopper to a preheater of a rotary kiln.<br>
Then the surface of the blended material on a grate is ignited by an ignition<br>
burner without rotating the pre-heater, the material is calcined from the upper<br>
layer and the calcination is completed at the outlet of the preheater. The raw<br><br>
 material, without being sent to the rotary kiln, is discharged to a product tank and<br>
sent through a transporting tank to a sintering process by a gas such as N2 gas.<br><br>

DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The raw materials used in the sinter mix are Blend mix, coke breeze, return<br>
sinter, lime stone fines, lime fines, are used in the process of sintering. These<br>
materials falls from individual hopper to common conveyor before entering into<br>
nodulising drum for proper mixing and balling. After mixing, the materials enter to<br>
sinter machine for sintering.<br>
The equipments used in the process are lime tanker, loss-in-weight system<br>
consisting of weigh hopper, main motor with drive assembly for screw feeder,<br>
agitator, pneumatic gate. De-dusting system consisting of bag filters, rotary<br>
feeder, exhaust duct. Main storage bunker is fitted with ultrasonic level sensor<br>
with aeration arrangement.<br>
As per the principle object of the present invention, modification of mixing and<br>
balling regime for proper assimilation of lime fines is carried out. The RPM of<br><br>
mixing and balling drum was reduced to 6 - 6.5 to assimilate 0-10 mm lime<br>
fines. This was confirmed by observing at unloading point of sinter mix of balling<br>
drum and charging side of sinter machine.<br>
There is provided an on - line automatic moisture control facility. The Moisture<br>
plays a important role in sintering. A permeability optimization system with on-line<br>
IR moisture measurement is installed in sinter plant to know how much water has<br>
to be added in balling drum for better process.<br>
Other materials may also be incorporated in the pellets by adding the same in<br>
either the mixing step or the balling step, preferably the latter. For example,<br>
hydrated lime dolomitic lime and waste products having a substantial iron<br>
content, such as BOF dust, may be added. Blast furnace dust may be added in<br>
limited amounts of from about 1% to about 3%.<br>
There is also provided as per the third objective of the present invention, a<br>
mechanism of a screw type arrangement to add lime in control manner. The<br>
screw feature has been designed to discharge lime at the rate of 1-5 ton / hr in<br>
controlled manner (see Fig 1)<br>
All the discharge line valves to be closed and air release valve in the hatch cover<br>
to be opened completely to make sure the tanker is free of pressure before filling<br>
the tanker (see Fig 1). Lime is charged into the tanker at Lime Calcination Plant<br>
through two top loading hatches as shown in Fig 2. After loading the tanker, the<br>
loading hatches closed tightly and the air release valve is closed and taken to<br>
Sinter plant. There is also provided ejector nozzles in the main pipeline as well as<br>
boosting lines has been provided to transport line from ground level to 15m<br>
height at shortage bunker.<br><br>
The air hose line is connected to the air inlet line of the tanker and the material<br>
hose is connected between the silo line and the material discharge line of tanker.<br>
The bypass air line of silo is first opened and bag filter fan is switched on. The air<br>
inlet valve of the tanker is opened for pressurization and the tanker booster line<br>
opened partially. The connections are shown in detail in Fig 3. When the<br>
pressure reaches 1.8 kg/cm2, open the discharge valve of the 1st cone from the<br>
rear end slowly.<br>
For discharging the 2nd cone the air inlet valve is again opened and when the<br>
pressure in the tanker is raised to 1.8 kg/cm2 open the discharge valve of the 2nd cone from the rear end slowly and the same operation carried out for 1st cone is<br>
to be repeated. To empty the tanker completely, the discharge cycle is to be<br>
repeated for the 3rd cone also. After empting the tanker the air inlet valve of the<br>
tanker is closed as well as the discharge and aeration valves of all three cones,<br>
and the booster and fluidizing valves are to be closed completely. Lime being<br>
sticky in nature as well as more affinity towards moisture, 12 aeration nozzles at<br>
three different heights have been provided for fluidization purpose. It was<br>
observed that there was no sticking of lime in main bunker.<br>
The installed lime addition system in Sinter Plant at, Durgapur Steel Plant<br>
comprises a mobile tanker, lime storage bunker, aeration system to the bunker,<br>
manual shut off valve, pneumatically operated solenoid valve, loss in weight<br>
system, conveying pipelines for lime and compressed air, de-dusting system,<br>
rotary air lock feeder and their associated electronic instruments.<br>
The Calcined lime of 0-10 mm size is filled up by gravity in the mobile tanker of<br>
15-ton full load capacity at New Lime Calcination Plant (NLCP) and is<br>
transported to Sinter Plant by road. The Calcined lime from the tanker at ground<br>
level at Sinter Plant is pneumatically transported to a height a 15 m level in the<br>
main storage bunker 50m3 through 150 NB conveying pipelines. The required dry<br>
compressed air for pneumatic conveying is taken from existing compressor.<br><br>
Additional dry compressed air is purged in all the pipe bends for boosting the<br>
material flow.<br>
For the quick operation of joining the tanker with the transporting pipelines,<br>
flexible hose with cam-lock couplings are used for both lime line and compressed<br>
air line. From the main storage bunker, the calcined lime is added to the existing<br>
common conveyor of Sinter Plant, which carries different raw materials from<br>
other existing weigh feeders to mixing drum, in a controlled manner for<br>
proportioning to the other raw materials through a suitably designed loss in<br>
weight system. The installed loss in weight system is capable of charging the<br>
time to the sinter at the rate of 1 - 5 tons / hour.<br>
De-dusting system is installed over the top of the main storage bunker by<br>
suitable structural supports. For efficient operation of de-dusting, the top cover of<br>
the storage bunker is fully sealed all around. An ultrasonic based non-contact<br>
type level sensor is installed at the top of the storage bunker to indicate the level<br>
of material inside the bunker.<br>
As per one of the objectives of the present invention ther is provided lime tankers<br>
for carrying lime fines from Lime Calcination Plant to Sinter plant. In this<br>
connection there is provided with two no's of lime tankers to carry and discharge<br>
lime fines at main bunker. Moreover, design modification of lime calcinations<br>
plant bunkers for loading lime into lime tanker is carried put. During initial trials<br>
there was difficulty for loading lime from existing lime bunkers of lime calcinations<br>
plant. Accordingly 2 bunkers were modified for smooth flow as well as unloading<br>
lime in lime tanker.<br>
A comparative trial with burnt lime at 600 mm Bed height conducted at the<br>
premises of Durgapur Steel plant for a reference to the innovation as herein<br>
described is given in a table form at Figure 4 and a productivity chart with lime<br><br>
usage of 4 - 5 kg/ton of sinter, started from Jan'2004 is shown in a graphical<br>
representation as fig 5.<br>
In the prior art all the sintering plants consume the lime fines, which are being<br>
crushed and screened before adding into sinter mix. The present invention<br>
provides a remedy to the difficult, time consuming and costly process of<br>
screening and crushing. The screening and crushing processes are overcome by<br>
the innovative process hereinbefore described. The said process is carried out by<br>
assimilation of the lime fines of 0-10mm size with adding more required amount<br>
of water through permeability optimization system. The size of the lime fines<br>
sometimes become coarse (more +10mm%) that affects the process as well as<br>
productivity<br>
The main feature of the innovation is to assimilate the lime fines into sinter mix<br>
before the sintering process starts. We have optimized amount of water as well<br>
as increasing the residence time of the sinter mix at nodulising drum for complete<br>
assimilation of lime fines. No lime was observed in the unloading point of sinter<br>
mix at sinter machine. This was further confirmed by increase in raw mix<br>
temperature after nodulising drum.<br>
The above-described embodiments of the invention are intended to be examples<br>
of the present invention. Numerous modifications changes and improvements<br>
within the scope of the invention will occur to the reader. Those of skill in the art<br>
may effect alterations and modifications thereto,, without departing from the<br>

sinter mix comprising the steps of reducing RPM of mixing and balling drum to<br>
assimilate the lime fines; controlling moisture level of the sinter mix automatically<br>
on-line; feeding lime fines in the sinter mix in a controlled manner; transporting<br>
lime fines to a height of 15m from ground level at storage bunker; fluidization of<br>
lime fines; providing lime tanker for carrying and discharging of lime fines at main<br>
bunker; modifying lime calcification plant bunkers (storage hoppers) by<br>
extending discharge chutes of existing storage hoppers at lime calcinations plant<br>
by adding extra length pipes to directly connect to inlet charge doors of<br>
transporting vehicle for smooth and direct discharge of lime fines thereby<br>
reducing time for unloading time in bunker and a system for carrying out the said<br>
process.</td>
