				<td>METHOD FOR PURIFYING AN EVAPORATION<br>
PRODUCT TO PRODUCE STEAM AND A DEVICE THEREFOR<br>
The invention in general relates 1o a method for purifying an evaporation product to produce<br>
steam and a device therefor, and in particular to a continuous sterilization process for biological<br>
waste and an apparatus for applying said process, the main line of which comprising, in the flow<br>
direction of a biowaste-containing liquid, a storage tank, at least one feed pump, at least one heating<br>
unit, at least one cooling unit and a circulation circuit for circulating the biowaste-containing liquid<br>
through the heating unit, as well as appropriate piping and valves.<br>
Biological waste is produced e.g. in hospitals, agricultural or biological research and<br>
production facilities, plasma fractionation facilities, etc. Biological wastes produced in such facilities<br>
cannot be directly conducted to a sewer system, as these wastes often contain micro-organisms, such<br>
as bacteria, viruses, germs and the like, which are hazardous to humans and animals. Prior to<br>
conducting to a sewer system, such biowaste must first be deactivated in a treatment plant designed<br>
for this purpose. For the treatment of biowaste, different treatment plants have been designed in<br>
which biowaste is sterilized prior to conducting to the sewer system. The sterilization of biowaste can<br>
be carried out chemically or by means of heat. The treatment plants can operate continuously or<br>
batchwise.<br>
In publication DE 40 16 116, a process is disclosed for the continuous purification of waste<br>
waters laden by micr-organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, germs and the like. In said process the<br>
waste water is heated to a disinfection temperature by means of a heat exchanger and / or a directly<br>
injected hot steam, whereafter the waste water is conducted to a swell circuit, e.g. to a pressurized<br>
vessel. In said dwell circuit, the wastewater is held at the disinfection temperature for a<br>
predetermined time. The residence time is measured by injecting an indicator into the wastewater at<br>
regular intervals, e.g. every five minutes for 5 seconds, and by measuring the presence of this<br>
indicator in the outlet of the dwell circuit. The time difference between indicator injection and<br>
detection shows the actual residence time, which can be compared with the residence time setting.<br>
In the journal Pharmaceutical Engineering, May / June 2001, pages 70 to 82, an article<br>
â€œBiowaste Systems" by Carl J. Carlson appears, relating to facilities for the treatment of biowaste.<br>
The article deals with biowaste treatment facilities of different type as well as with dimensioning<br>
principles and problems relating thereto.<br>
According to said article, a typical thermal continuous biowaste sterilisation apparatus<br>
comprises a separating unit for solid matter, a storage tank, a heating unit and a dwell circuit as well<br>
as a circulating circuit for circulating biowaste through said heating unit and said dwell circuit.<br>
According to the article, a typical continuous apparatus comprises the following stages : a heating<br>
stage, whereby biowaste is circulated in a heat exchanger and in a dwell circuit, until a temperature<br>
sufficient to kill the micro-organisms is reached. This is followed by an operating stage when the<br>
biowaste has reached the required temperature over the whole length of the heat exchanger. Thereby<br>
the treated biowaste is conducted through cooling equipment to a sewer system. If one or several<br>
sterilization parameters (temperature in the dwell circuit, pressure etc.) go outside the predetermined<br>
value, and the biowaste is therefore insufficiently sterilized, the process enters a hold state, where the<br>
biowaste is circulated through the heating unit and the dwell circuit until the parameter or parameters<br>
in question are again within the given limits. In case of an alarm, the apparatus enters the cooling<br>
mode, in which the operation of the heating unit is stopped, and the biowaste is recirculated back to<br>
the pump feed line until the apparatus is again in working order. According to said article, provisions<br>
for the steam sterilization of the parts downstream from the storage tank should be provided, as well<br>
as provisions for preventing the transfer of the active biowaste to the cooling circuit. In addition,<br>
steam sterilization of the storage tank, the piping, venting filters, etc, should be provided in the<br>
apparatus.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for purifying an evaporation product to<br>
produce pure steam, wherein the evaporation product is set in a spiraling rotational motion to<br>
separate droplets by centrifugal force, characterized by providing an evaporation product by means of<br>
a falling film evaporator conducting said evaporation product into an annular rising channel<br>
comprising spiral fins forming a spiral path, providing at least one opening in the outer surface of<br>
said spiral path, collecting droplets and impurities on an actively cooled surface outside said opening<br>
or openings.<br>
The invention further provides a device having a pressure vessel shell and a rising channel<br>
and fins in said rising channel forming a spiral path, at least one opening being provided in the outer<br>
surface of the spiral path, and a temperature-regulated surface provided outside said opening(s),<br>
characterised by the device being connected to the lower end of a falling film evaporator for the<br>
purification of an evaporation product to produce pure steam.<br>
In the starting up stage of the present heat sterilization process for biowaste, conditions at the<br>
upper limits of the capacity thereof, i.e â€œworst case" conditions are used. Thereby a liquid is<br>
conducted through a heating unit at maximum flow rate, which liquid is subsequently cooled to a<br>
level, which corresponds to the lowest defined temperature of the feed flow. When a sufficient<br>
sterilization capacity has been reached under these extreme conditions, in other words, when the<br>
temperature in the sterilization zone can be maintained at such a high level that it corresponds to the<br>
residence time required at the flow rate in question, the process operates with great reliability under<br>
all conditions occurring during operation. Preferably, the invention farther comprises an arrangement by<br>
means of which the tightness of those valves, which are critical during startup and in<br>
exceptional situations, can be ensured, and, if necessary, the whole valve system can be<br>
sterilized for maintenance measures.<br>
In a process according to the invention, during startup the operability of the process is thus<br>
ensured, that at maximum capacity of the pump a liquid flow is conducted through the<br>
heating unit, the temperature of which flow has been lowered in the return circuit to a level<br>
corresponding to the minimum temperature of the water in the storage tank during<br>
operation. The sterilization stage following the heating stage comprises at least<br>
measurement of the temperature at the outlet end. When the residence time of the liquid in<br>
the sterilization zone has been found sufficient under the above conditions, it can also be<br>
assumed that the operability of the process can be maintained independently of variations<br>
occurring in the feed.<br>
A device according to the invention is provided with means for verifying the sterilization<br>
ability at maximum load during startup. For verifying the capacity of the device, the lowest<br>
water temperature and the greatest possible flow are used. In order to ensure that the test<br>
actually represents the worst case, the maximum flow must be limited so, that during actual<br>
operation it cannot exceed the flow used in the test. Preferably, this is achieved using a<br>
positive displacement pump, which at a constant speed of rotation (determined by the<br>
electrical motor used) always delivers a constant flow, independent of the pressures at the<br>
suction and discharge ends. When a centrifugal pump is used, the maximum flow is limited<br>
by setting standards for the suction and discharge pressures and monitoring these values in<br>
the control system. Typically, the suction side pressure is essentially constant, because the<br>
buffer tank serving as a source is at atmospheric pressure. The discharge back pressure is<br>
set to a minimum level, corresponding to the desired maximum flow rate, and the pressure<br>
is monitored by means of pressure sensors.<br>
In order to bring the liquid in the return circuit to a temperature corresponding to the<br>
minimum temperature of the feed, a heat exchanger and appropriate temperature sensors<br>
are provided in the return line. The heat exchanger is dimensioned correspondingly, and<br>
minimum limits for cooling water flow and temperature are set in the control system.<br>
A sterilization apparatus according to the present invention comprises a pump capable of a<br>
certain maximum flow rate, preferably a displacement pump, by means of which a liquid to<br>
be sterilized is conducted through a heating unit at a constant rate. Following the heating unit, a<br>
sterilization zone is arranged which is provided with temperature measurement at least at the outlet<br>
end. Since the capacity of the pump can be kept constant, it can be ensured that the residence time in<br>
the sterilization zone is sufficient to achieve the desired sterilization level. In case the residence time<br>
is insufficient, the flow leaving the sterilization zone is conducted through the return circuit back to<br>
the heating unit inlet. Because the temperature measurement is arranged downstream from the<br>
heating unit, it is ensured that the residence time is insufficient.<br>
The return circuit is provided with cooling equipment. When the return circuit is cooled essentially to<br>
the minimum temperature occurring in the liquid in the storage tank, it can be ascertained that the<br>
temperature of the input flow of the heating unit is not lower than the minimum level required by the<br>
heating means.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus according to the invention comprises an arrangement of serial valves<br>
arranged after the sterilization zone, by means of which valve arrangement it is ensured that no<br>
insufficiently sterilized liquid, which has passed the sterilization zone, can flow outside the<br>
apparatus, not even if there is a leakage in a distributing valve.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the invention is described below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawing.<br>
4A<br>
The figure shows a biowaste treatment apparatus according to the invention. The main components<br>
provided in the main line of the treatment apparatus in the flow direction of a biowaste-containing<br>
liquid are a storage tank 20, a heating unit 30 and a discharge cooling unit 40. In addition, the<br>
treatment apparatus comprises a circulation circuit provided with a circuit cooling unit 50 and<br>
connected to the main line, by which circulation circuit the biowaste-containing liquid can be<br>
circulated through heating unit 30.<br>
Preferably, the biowaste water is conducted into the storage tank through a solid matter separating<br>
unit, which is not shown in the figure. Storage tank 20 is provided with a mixer 21, and a driving<br>
motor (which is not shown in the figure) connected thereto, by which the biowaste water in the<br>
storage tank 20 is mixed to prevent sedimentation in the storage tank 20. The storage tank 20 is also<br>
provided with a level measurement L.<br>
From the storage tank 20 the biowaste water is conducted into heating unit 30 through an<br>
inlet valve 13 of the main line by means of a constant capacity feed pump 31. In this<br>
embodiment, heating unit 30 consists of a heat exchanger, in which steam is used as a heat<br>
source. After the heating unit, a sterilization zone 32 is arranged, which herein is provided<br>
with two temperature measurements T1 and T2. The measurement of the outlet end T2 is<br>
essential, because at that point the lowest temperature occurs.<br>
In continuous operation, the sterilized and deactivated biowaste water is conducted from<br>
heating unit 30 into a discharge cooling unit 40 via valve group 14 and 15 which forms a<br>
barrier site. From discharge cooling unit 40, the deactivated biowaste water is conducted<br>
through main line discharge valve 17 to a sewer system at point A2. In this embodiment,<br>
discharge cooling unit 40 is a heat exchanger using water as a cooling medium.<br>
In addition to the above-described main line of the treatment apparatus, the apparatus<br>
comprises a return circuit beginning at the barrier site of the main line between sterilization<br>
zone 32 and discharge cooling unit 40 and ending at the suction inlet of feed pump 31. In<br>
front of the first valve 14 of the barrier site of the main line, a first branch is arranged to<br>
the first parallel inlet valve S3, and between the first valve 14 and the second valve 15 of<br>
the barrier site of the main line, a second outer branch is arranged to a second parallel inlet<br>
valve 54. Said serial valves 14 and 15 of the main line and said parallel valves 53, 54 of the<br>
circulation circuit together form a barrier site. After said parallel valves 53,54, the inner<br>
branch and outer branch are joined together, whereafter the joined line of the circulation<br>
circuit leads to a circuit cooling unit 50 provided in the circulation circuit. After circuit<br>
cooling unit 50, the circulation circuit is closed via circuit discharge valve 55 to a point<br>
between main line inlet valve 13 and main line feed pump 31. The tightness of the first<br>
serial valve 14 can be controlled by means of pressure measurement P coupled to the line<br>
between first serial valve 14 and second serial valve 15.<br>
By means of said main line serial valves 14,15 and said two parallel branches of the<br>
circulation circuit, it is ensured that discharge cooling unit 40 and the subsequent zones<br>
cannot under any conditions be contaminated.<br>
The cooling water needed in cooling units 40,50 is brought into circuit cooling unit 50<br>
through cooling water inlet valve 51 at point Dl. The cooling water circulated in circuit<br>
cooling unit SO is conducted further to discharge cooling unit 40. The cooling water<br>
circulated in discharge cooling unit 40 is discharged via cooling water discharge valve 52<br>
at point D2.<br>
The steam needed in heating unit 30 is fed from point El 30 through first main steam line<br>
inlet valve 71 and second inlet valve 72 into heating unit 30. The condensate formed in<br>
heating unit 30 is discharged at point E2.<br>
The startup of the apparatus is carried out by self-testing effected by a control system.<br>
Thereafter, biowaste is fed into tank 20, and the circulation of the biowaste is started in<br>
heating unit 30 at constant speed by means of the circuit, while the temperature of heating<br>
unit 30 is raised to the desired level. The circulating water is cooled in circuit cooling unit<br>
50 to essentially a level corresponding to the minimum temperature of the water in the<br>
storage tank. In this way it is ensured that the load of the heating unit does not exceed its<br>
capacity at the beginning of the continuous process.<br>
In the above described startup stage, the integrity of valve 14 is also tested by means of<br>
pressure measurement P. If no pressure rise is found by pressure measurement P, valve 14<br>
operates in the desired manner. If as a result of defective tightness of the valve, a pressure<br>
rise occurs, it is possible to safely conduct the flow further into the return circuit through<br>
the outer branch and valve 53. Thereby valves 14,15,53, 54 can be sterilized for<br>
maintenance by raising the temperature of the whole circuit to a sufficient level for a<br>
sufficient time.<br>
When the measurement of the temperature of the outlet end of the sterilization zone shows<br>
that the temperature in the sterilization zone is maintained at a sufficient level relative to<br>
the constant flow rate, the circuit can be interrupted by closing valve 53 and opening valve<br>
14, and the deactivated biowaste water can be conducted through discharge cooling means<br>
40 to the sewer system at point A2.<br>
Preferably, the sterilization apparatus shown in the figure is controlled by means of a<br>
control system or a computer. Information on the state and operation of all components<br>
shown in the figure are fed into the control system, and on the basis of this information the<br>
status of the components as well as of the whole apparatus can be shown on a display. In<br>
the figure, only the components necessary for understanding the invention are shown, and<br>
all other components, e.g. those relating to various measurements, have been left out.<br>
