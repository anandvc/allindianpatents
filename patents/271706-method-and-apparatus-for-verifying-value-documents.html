				<td>Method and apparatus for checking documents of value<br>
[001] The invention relates to a method for checking documents of value, in<br>
particular for recognizing forged documents of value, and an apparatus for carrying<br>
out the method. The forged documents of value to be recognized are composed<br>
forgeries which are composed of parts of different documents of value. The composed<br>
forgeries can be composed of parts of authentic and of forged documents of value, but<br>
composed forgeries that are composed exclusively from parts of authentic documents<br>
of value are also known.<br>
[002] From the prior art there are known various methods for recognizing forged<br>
bank notes. For recognizing composed forgeries, for example methods for detecting<br>
adhesive strips are employed by which the individual parts of the composed forgery<br>
are glued together. For the authenticity check, moreover, the bank notes for example<br>
are checked as to properties which distinguish the authentic bank note paper from<br>
normal paper, for example as to its fluorescence properties. Many composed forgeries<br>
partly consist of authentic and partly of forged paper which, however, has<br>
fluorescence properties similar to those of authentic bank notes. Furthermore,<br>
forgeries are composed which exclusively consist of parts of authentic bank notes.<br>
With the previous methods it is not possible to recognize those composed forgeries<br>
which deliver measuring signals, e.g. fluorescence signals, comparable to those of<br>
authentic bank notes.<br>
[003] It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a possibility for recognizing<br>
forged documents of value which are composed of a plurality of parts of authentic or<br>
of authentic and forged documents of value.<br>
[004] This problem is solved by the features of the independent claims. In claims<br>
dependent thereon advantageous embodiments and developments of the invention are<br>
specified.<br><br>
[005] With the method according to the invention in a first step a property of a first<br>
feature of the document of value to be checked and in a second step a property of a<br>
second feature of the document of value is determined. In a further step the properties<br>
of the first and second feature are compared to each other and therefrom a difference<br>
between the first and the second feature is ascertained. Preferably, the properties to be<br>
compared are the same properties, such as e.g. the color of the first feature and the<br>
color of the second feature. The property of the first and the one of the second feature<br>
are preferably determined with the same sensor. Then the ascertained difference is<br>
evaluated. In the evaluation it is examined whether the ascertained difference lies<br>
within a predetermined range which includes the set values set to be acceptable for the<br>
difference. This range is determined for example with the aid of standard data valid<br>
for the document of value. The limits of the range of the set values are given by one or<br>
a plurality of threshold values, such as e.g. maximum values or also minimum values<br>
for the ascertained difference. The standard data contain e.g. information about<br>
reference features and about maximum acceptable deviations from the reference<br>
features.<br>
[006] The further step, which serves for ascertaining a difference, can also consist in<br>
- as an alternative to the direct comparison of the properties of the two features - that a<br>
property to be expected for the second feature is compared to the property of the<br>
second feature. The property to be expected for the second feature can be determined<br>
by extrapolation, for example by an extrapolation from the property or the properties<br>
of the first feature and/ or from further measuring data of the document of value. The<br>
extrapolation can also be carried out using standard data valid for the bank note, for<br>
example starting out from the first feature. Thus, with printed image features having<br>
an individual structure the extrapolation of the position of a second printed image<br>
segment can be effected for example from the position of a first printed image<br>
segment with the aid of a reference printed image which was determined on the basis<br>
of a multitude of corresponding printed images of authentic bank notes. The<br>
extrapolation can also be effected from further measuring data of the bank note, e.g.<br>
from the measured spatial arrangement of further features with the aid of the standard<br>
data.<br><br>
[007] The property to be expected can also be determined with the aid of the standard<br>
data valid for the document of value. The difference ascertained in doing so in general<br>
differs from the difference ascertained with the first-mentioned variant of the method.<br>
For evaluating, the ascertained difference is compared to set values, the set values also<br>
being determined from the standard data for the document of value. These set values,<br>
too, in general differ from the set values of the first-mentioned variant of the method.<br>
In the evaluation it is examined whether the ascertained difference lies within the<br>
range of set values which contains e.g. the maximum acceptable deviations of the<br>
property of the second feature from the property to be expected for the second feature.<br>
In the evaluating step it is also possible to examine a match of the difference with the<br>
set values and to determine a corresponding match degree.<br>
[008] The standard data which form the basis for the range of set values and/or for<br>
the determination of the second feature's property to be expected can be ascertained<br>
with the help of a multitude of documents of value or could have been ascertained in<br>
the run-up to the check. Preferably, the standard data are ascertained with the help of<br>
documents of value of the same type as the document of value to be examined, in the<br>
case of bank notes for example with the help of bank notes of the same denomination.<br>
The standard data contain, for example, information about the properties of reference<br>
features and about the maximum acceptable deviations of the properties of the<br>
features checked with the method according to the invention from the properties of the<br>
reference features. For the different types of documents of value the respective<br>
specific standard data can be stored. The standard data can be chosen with the help of<br>
the type of the document of value, for example the currency and denomination of a<br>
bank note. For choosing the standard data valid for the document of value to be<br>
checked, the type of document of value is for this purpose identified for example<br>
before the document of value is checked. In the case of bank notes this identifying can<br>
be e.g. determining the denomination previous to the method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
[009] The first and second feature to be compared with the method according to the<br>
invention can be of the same type but can also be features of a different type. The<br><br>
method can be carried out for a single property of the two features, but it can also be<br>
carried out for a plurality of properties of the two features. Furthermore, the method<br>
can also be carried out for further first and second features. It is especially<br>
advantageous to carry out the method for both features of the front side and features<br>
of the back side of the document of value, i.e. at least one feature pair of the front side<br>
and at least one feature pair of the back side is checked.<br>
[0010]In an embodiment the first and/or the second feature is at least one segment of<br>
at least one predetermined printed image. The first and second feature can be for<br>
example segments of the same predetermined printed image. But they can also be<br>
segments of different predetermined printed images which preferably have been<br>
produced with the same printing method (e.g. offset printing, engraving, ...), in<br>
particular within the same printing step. The printed image areas produced with the<br>
same printing method, in particular within the same printing step, have a very well<br>
defined relative position to each other which can hardly be exactly reproduced when<br>
individual parts of the documents of value are subsequently joined together.<br>
[0011]The printed images to be compared as to their properties can have one or a<br>
plurality of segments of one or a plurality of design elements, such as e.g. symbols or<br>
geometric elements, and/or of one or a plurality of image motifs, such as e.g. pictures<br>
of persons, buildings, animals, objects or the like, or, likewise, one or a plurality of<br>
segments of patterns, writings or characters, such as e.g. graphic characters, numbers,<br>
letters. In a further embodiment the first and/or second feature, additionally or<br>
alternatively to the printed image or printed segment, has at least one segment of a<br>
security element or of an edge of the document of value.<br>
[0012]The property with respect to which the first and the second feature are<br>
compared preferably relates to the position and/ or the shape of the respective feature.<br>
In the embodiment with the alternative further step the property of the first and second<br>
feature as well as the property to be expected for the second feature relates to the<br>
position and/or the shape of the respective feature. Properties which relate to the<br>
shape of the respective feature are for example a color, a spectral and/ or spatial color<br>
distribution, a size or a form of the respective feature. Properties which relate to the<br><br>
position of the respective feature are for example an absolute position, a relative<br>
position, in particular a distance relative to a reference feature or an orientation<br>
relative to a reference feature. As a reference feature for example an edge of the<br>
document of value, a security element, a reference printed image or also a segment of<br>
the same can be used. The reference printed image can be e.g. a further segment of the<br>
predetermined printed image of the first and/ or of the second feature, but it can also<br>
be a segment of a further printed image which has been produced preferably with the<br>
same printing method, in particular within the same printing step, as the printed image<br>
of the first and/ or second feature.<br>
[0013]With authentic bank notes the relative positions and orientations of the features<br>
are very precisely defined, in particular in case of printed features which have been<br>
produced within the same printing process or even within the same printing step.<br>
Thus, the method according to the invention is preferably carried out in such a way<br>
that as features certain printed image areas are used from which a difference<br>
concerning the position is ascertained.<br>
[0014]For evaluating, the difference ascertained with the method according to the<br>
invention is compared with the particular set values, and it is checked whether the<br>
ascertained difference lies within the range of the particular set values. In the case of<br>
an authentic document of value the ascertained difference should lie within the range<br>
of the particular set values. In the case of a composed forgery, in contrast, there is a<br>
high probability that at least a number of features at least in some of their properties<br>
have differences which do not lie within the range of the particular set values. Due to<br>
the subsequent composing of the composed forgery it is to be expected that in doing<br>
so e.g. the difference of the absolute position of some printed image areas deviates by<br>
more than the acceptable deviation from the reference values of the authentic<br>
documents of value.<br>
[0015]The evaluation of the ascertained difference is effected for example for<br>
determining the authenticity of the document of value or also for the fitness check of<br>
the document of value, for instance with regard to the presence of tears or gluings.<br>
With the aid of the method according to the invention not only composed forgeries<br><br>
can be detected but also authentic documents of value which, however, for the<br>
purpose of „repairing" were partly or completely glued together. This gluing together<br>
may also lead to differences in the position and/ or the shape of features which do not<br>
correspond to the set values. For example, printed images through which runs a tear<br>
and which subsequently were joined together can be changed such that the differences<br>
in position ascertained in the printed image lie outside the range of the set values.<br>
With torn authentic documents of value the differences in the position of features may<br>
also deviate from those of intact authentic documents of value and can be detected<br>
with the method according to the invention.<br>
[0016]In general, a composed forgery can have a separating line or a plurality of<br>
separating lines at which it is composed. Though the position of these separating lines<br>
on the composed forgery are not foreseeable, but for recognizing composed forgeries<br>
it is advantageous to selectively use such features which with a high probability are<br>
disposed on different partial bank notes of the composed forgery. For this reason the<br>
method according to the invention is preferably carried out on the basis of the<br>
properties of such features which are disposed on the document of value as far apart<br>
from each other as possible. Preferably, the first and second feature are chosen such<br>
that the distance between these features in one direction, in particular in the direction<br>
along the connecting line of the features, extends over a substantial part of the<br>
document of value, but at least amounts to half of the extent of the document of value.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous to compare further first and further second features<br>
with each other whose connecting line encloses with the connecting line of the first<br>
and second feature a large angle, e.g. an angle of at least 20°. In a development of the<br>
method the position of the separating lines of a plurality of known composed forgeries<br>
can also be detected, and therefrom a probability for the position of the separating<br>
lines on the document of value to be checked can be determined. In dependence<br>
thereon e.g. the features to be used for the method according to the invention can be<br>
chosen such that most of the known separating lines extend between these features.<br>
[0017] A second method according to the invention for recognizing forged documents<br>
of value, in particular for recognizing composed forgeries, can run in a way as<br><br>
follows: For checking the bank note or the composed forgery, in a first step a feature<br>
of a document of value is identified, in particular a feature of a bank note or of a<br>
composed forgery. As a feature, preferably at least one segment of at least one printed<br>
image is chosen, e.g. at least one segment of a pattern, or of a writing, or of a<br>
character, in particular of a number, of a letter, or of a graphic character. For<br>
identifying the feature, a recognition of a character string can be carried out with the<br>
aid of an OCR method. Then the size and/ or form and/ or structure of the feature is<br>
determined, preferably with a higher accuracy than during the identification. For<br>
ascertaining a difference the determined size and/ or form and/ or structure of the<br>
feature is compared with at least one size and/ or form and/ or structure to be expected<br>
for the feature. This size and/ or form and/ or structure to be expected for the feature<br>
is determined with the aid of the standard data valid for the document of value. These<br>
standard data can be chosen with the help of the previously determined type of the<br>
document of value, for example the currency and denomination of a bank note, and<br>
contain for example information about the properties of reference features and about<br>
the maximum acceptable deviations therefrom. For evaluating, the ascertained<br>
difference is compared to set values, the set values also being determined from the<br>
standard data for the document of value. In doing so, for example, it is examined<br>
whether the ascertained difference lies within the range of the set values which<br>
contains the maximum deviations with respect to the size and/ or form and/ or<br>
structure of the feature, or whether it exceeds the maximum deviations. In the<br>
evaluation it is examined, for example, how good the match is between the measured<br>
properties of the feature and the set values therefor, and a corresponding match degree<br>
is determined. In the steps where the difference is ascertained and evaluated e.g. an<br>
OCV method can be employed.<br>
[0018]In the methods according to the invention the features are detected, for<br>
example, optically, in particular in the visible or in the not visible spectral region, or<br>
magnetically. A further aspect of the invention relates to the apparatus, which is used<br>
for carrying out the method. Such an apparatus can have a sensor for checking<br>
documents of value, in particular bank notes, e.g. an image sensor for detecting<br><br>
optical features of the document of value or a magnet sensor for detecting magnetic<br>
features.<br>
[0019]In the following the invention is described by way of example with reference to<br>
the accompanying Figures.<br>
[0020]Fig. 1a	shows a schematic representation of an authentic bank note,<br>
[0021]Fig. 1b	shows a schematic representation of a composed forgery which is<br>
composed of two parts,<br>
[0022]Fig. 2a	shows a misalignment of a printed image in a composed forgery,<br>
[0023]Fig. 2b	shows a segment from the denomination detail of a composed<br>
forgery, the separating line of which runs through the numbers of<br>
the denomination detail.<br>
[0024]Figure 1a schematically represents the back side of an authentic bank note 10.<br>
Here are shown, by way of example, some printed images 40, 60, 70 which have been<br>
produced e.g. by means of engraving, offset printing or further printing methods, as<br>
well as a serial number 30 printed at two positions onto the bank note 10. Of course,<br>
further printed images and security elements can be additionally contained on or in the<br>
banknote 10.<br>
[0025]Figure lb schematically shows a composed forgery 1 which is composed of two<br>
parts, for example of a left authentic partial bank note 1a and a right forged partial<br>
bank note lb. At a separating line 2 running approximately perpendicular through the<br>
composed forgery 1 the two partial bank notes la and lb are glued together. In this<br>
example, however, the gluing together of the composed forgery 1 did not succeed in<br>
disposing the two lower edges 5a and 5b such that they extend precisely in one line.<br>
The lower edges 5a and 5b are slightly inclined to each other and at the intersection<br>
point with the separating line 2 they can also be a bit misaligned in vertical direction.<br>
For a better illustration the inclination is drawn relatively strong in Figure 1b. For the<br>
method according to the invention, however, it is sufficient that the two partial bank<br>
notes la and lb are not quite precisely aligned to each other. A slight deviation is<br><br>
sufficient which does not have to be given with respect to the edges of the bank note<br>
but may be given with respect to the property of any feature which with a<br>
corresponding accuracy can be metrologically detected.<br>
[0026]For checking a bank note 10 e.g. an image sensor is used with which, among<br>
other things, the lower edge 50 of the bank note 10 is detected. From the image data<br>
can be determined for example the absolute position of a left section of the lower edge<br>
50, which e.g. extends from the left corner over a certain distance to the right, and<br>
analogously the absolute position of a right section of the lower edge which extends<br>
from the right corner over a distance to the left. In doing so, in a composed forgery 1<br>
e.g. the absolute positions of the lower edge sections 5a, 5b are determined. Then a<br>
difference is ascertained by comparing these absolute positions, for example by<br>
subtraction of the coordinates of the two corner points or of a plurality of single image<br>
points of the two lower edge sections or of two center points of the two lower edge<br>
sections ascertained from the image data. For evaluating the difference, the difference<br>
is compared with set values which result from standard data valid for the document of<br>
value which for example have been determined in the run-up to the process with the<br>
help of authentic bank notes of the same denomination. The ascertained difference of<br>
the absolute positions for an authentic bank note 10 lies with a very high probability<br>
within the range of the set values for this position difference. In a composed forgery 1<br>
whose lower edge sections 5a, 5b do not extend in a straight line the difference<br>
exceeds - in the case of a correspondingly large deviation - the limits of the range of<br>
the set values for this position difference. The result of the evaluation of the<br>
difference can be used in this way for checking a bank note, in particular for<br>
recognizing a composed forgery. The evaluation result, however, cannot only be used<br>
as an authenticity criterion but also for checking the fitness of the bank note, for<br>
example for identifying a torn bank note or a bank note glued together with adhesive<br>
strips. In these bank notes, too, a displacement of the positions of features may occur,<br>
when e.g. bank note parts have been glued together a bit obliquely or when the parts<br>
of a torn bank note are a bit displaced against each other during the transport of the<br>
bank note.<br><br>
[0027] In an alternative embodiment a difference of the absolute positions of the right<br>
and left lower edge section can also be ascertained in a way as follows: From a first of<br>
the absolute positions of the two lower edge sections, e.g. of the left lower edge<br>
section 5a, the absolute position to be expected for the second lower edge section, 5b,<br>
is determined. This can be effected for example by extrapolating the course of the first<br>
lower edge section 5a. Then a difference between the extrapolated position to be<br>
expected of the second lower edge section 5b and the actual position of the second<br>
lower edge section 5b is ascertained and compared with set values for the difference.<br>
Since here the match between an actual property and the set value for this property is<br>
examined, the difference and the set value in this embodiment are relatively small<br>
compared to those of the previously described embodiment.<br>
[0028]The deviation from the set values, which results from the composing of the<br>
partial bank notes la, 1b, could be recognized by many features of the composed<br>
forgery 1. With the method according to the invention in the first and second<br>
procedure step there can be compared e.g. the properties described in the following of<br>
the following features: The serial numbers 3a and 3b have a relative position and a<br>
relative orientation to each other which deviates from the relative position and<br>
orientation of the two serial numbers 30 of the authentic bank note. Since the<br>
separating line 2 extends through between the numbers of the denomination ,,1000" of<br>
the bank note, the printed images of the numbers 4a and 4b also have a deviating<br>
relative position and orientation compared to the respective characters of the authentic<br>
bank note 10. The separating line 2 furthermore extends through the printed images<br>
shown above the denomination detail, so that the partial printed images 6a and 6b or<br>
7a and 7b, too, have a deviating relative position and orientation compared to the<br>
authentic bank note 10 (misalignment of printed image).<br>
[0029]The property to be determined according to the invention can also be the size of<br>
the features, e.g. the size of the serial numbers 3a and 3b, of the numbers of the<br>
denomination detail or also of the printed images. Furthermore, as a property there<br>
can also be determined the distance of the respective feature, e.g. the serial numbers<br>
3a and 3b, to a reference feature, for instance the distance to an edge of the document<br><br>
of value or to a further security element on the bank note (not shown). The reference<br>
feature can also be a reference printed image to which the distance of a first and of a<br>
second segment of a further printed image is determined. Reference printed image<br>
could be e.g. the denomination number „1", to which the distances of the right outer<br>
edge of the printed image 7b and of the left outer edge of the printed image 7a could<br>
be determined. Furthermore, with the method according to the invention there can also<br>
be determined the color of the printed images 6a and 6b or 7a and 7b. The color of the<br>
printed images of the two partial bank notes 1a, 1b e.g. can be different, while the<br>
color within the printed images 60 or 70 of the authentic bank note 10 is uniform. For<br>
example, there can be determined properties such as the average color of the printed<br>
image, or the averaged color or spectral color distribution over one or a plurality of<br>
specific areas of the printed image, or also their spatial distribution over the printed<br>
image. If the features of the composed forgery 1 do not reproduce precisely enough<br>
those of the authentic bank note 10, the difference ascertained from the properties of<br>
the two features lies outside the set values. Thus, a recognition of a forgery is<br>
possible.<br>
[0030] For illustrating the misalignment of the printed image of the composed forgery<br>
1, in Figure 2a is shown the printed image composed of the printed images 6a, 7a of<br>
the authentic partial bank note 1a and the printed images 6b, 7b of the forged partial<br>
bank note lb (continuous line). Additionally, the two printed images 6a' and 7a'<br>
extrapolated from the printed images 6a, 7a are sketched (dotted line), which have the<br>
absolute position to be expected for the printed images 6b, 7b. The absolute position<br>
of the printed image 6a' can be extrapolated e.g. from the straight course of the printed<br>
image 6a. Additionally, here standard data of the (authentic) printed image 60 could<br>
be used, for example for determining the length and the exact form of the extrapolated<br>
printed image 6a'. So as to be able to extrapolate the absolute position of the printed<br>
image 7a', it is necessary to exactly know the properties of the (authentic) printed<br>
image 70. The absolute position of the printed image 7a', which has the absolute<br>
position to be expected for the printed image 7b, is determined, starting out from the<br>
printed image 7a, with the aid of the standard data of the (authentic) printed image 70<br>
of the bank note. Then a difference is ascertained by comparing the absolute position<br><br>
of the printed image 6a' or the printed image 7a' with the (actual) position of the<br>
printed image 6b or 7b, respectively, for example by comparing the coordinates of<br>
certain details of the printed image. The respective difference is compared with set<br>
values, which this difference is allowed to take on in the case of authentic bank notes.<br>
The set values, which for example are valid for the difference of the coordinates of the<br>
right lower corner of the printed images 6a' and 6b or 7a' and 7b, can lie e.g. within a<br>
range including the zero, the range extending [sic] in a fluctuation range around zero.<br>
This fluctuation range can be determined from the standard data of the bank note and<br>
extend e.g. symmetrically or asymmetrically around zero. In the case of the printed<br>
images 6a, 6b or 7a, 7b of the composed forgery shown in Figure 2a the difference in<br>
the y-coordinates of the lower corner is relatively large and with a high probability<br>
lies outside the range of the set values valid for this difference.<br>
[0031]The mentioned examples represent only a small selection. For the method<br>
according to the invention there can be used any properties of all sorts of features of<br>
the document of value.<br>
[0032]In Figure 2b is shown a further example for a misalignment of a printed image<br>
in a different composed forgery, with the help of which the second method according<br>
to the invention is represented. The two characters „1" and „0" belong e.g. to a<br>
denomination detail through which extends a separating line 8. The character „1" is<br>
formed by a printed image 9, which in this case is composed of two partial printed<br>
images 9a and 9b. For checking the composed forgery, in a first step a feature of the<br>
bank note and/or of the composed forgery is identified. This step e.g. can consist in<br>
recognizing the characters of the denomination detail, in particular of the printed<br>
image 9 as character „1", with the aid of an OCR method. Then for example the form<br>
and the size of the printed image 9 is determined. By comparing the form and size of<br>
the printed image 9 with the form and size to be expected in the case of an authentic<br>
bank note a difference is ascertained. The form and size to be expected is determined<br>
with the aid of standard data which are valid for authentic bank notes of the<br>
denomination of the composed forgery. The standard data contain for example<br>
reference characters which are chosen from a set of reference characters on the basis<br><br>
of the previously determined currency and denomination of the bank note or<br>
composed forgery to be checked. For ascertaining the difference, for example,<br>
intensity values at various image points of the printed image 9 or of the reference<br>
character „1" can be subtracted from each other. For evaluating, the ascertained<br>
difference is compared with set values. In the evaluation it is examined for example<br>
with the aid of an OCV method how good the match is between the printed image 9<br>
and the reference character „1" with respect to its form and size. It is examined<br>
whether the ascertained difference lies within the range of set values or whether it<br>
exceeds the maximum acceptable deviations of the character form and character size.<br><br>
