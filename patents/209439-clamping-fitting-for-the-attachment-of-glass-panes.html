Title:       Clamping fitting for the attachment of glass panes<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a clamping fitting for the attachment of glass panes including two clamping components clamping the glass pane between them, one clamping component being designed as a cone nut engaging in a borehole in the glass pane and presenting a cap, which nut on the outside of the glass pane being covered by a cap which is in true alignment with the outside of the glass pane, whereby said cap is detachably connected with the cone nut by means of a clip fastening arranged at the cap.<br>
An arrangement substantially forming this kind is known from DE 299 19 333 U1, in this case, however, the cone-shaped clamping component is not adapted as a cone nut, but replaced by a resilient ring, whereby a resilient layer, being arranged between the resilient ring and the glass pane, serves as a glass protection. On the threaded bolt, provided to be connected to the sub-construction, is screwed a nut adapted as the inside, i.e. as the second clamping component. The head of the threaded bolt and therefore the aforementioned cone-shaped ring are covered by means of a covering plate, being in true alignment with the outside of the glass pane, which is adapted to being detachably arranged and to being resiliently held in place through the layer extending as far as to the outside of the plate and defining the glass protection.<br>
Furthermore It is disclosed to hold the covering plate with a leaf spring mounted thereto, which can resiliently engage in an opening formed in a borehole of the ring and being engaged from the back. Therefore, a dip fastening is proposed which has to be mounted additionally at a flat side of the cap in form of a leaf spring, which in<br><br>
-2-<br>
suitably manner engages into an opening of the ring, which can be engaged from the back. As for aesthetic reasons, the spring is exclusively arranged at the side of the cap oriented towards the glass pane, corresponding free space has to be forcibly provided,' which is lost for the contour of the screw head of the fastening screw. This is all the more important, as in the known arrangement, the ring itself, as it is the case with cone nuts readily available in retail, does not sit flush with the exterior flange thereof at the outside of the glass pane.<br>
With  the  clamping  fittings  according  to  DE19713 038 02,  the second clamping component consists of a counter-plate being able to clamp with a cone nut, which for example can be screwed directly on the cone nut as a so-called adjustable lock nut. In case of angular connections and the like, the counter-plate can likewise be formed by means of a pivoting member/clamping member, which is screwed on the   cone   nut.   Further  fastening   means   can   connect  to   the aforementioned adjustable lock nut as well as to the aforementioned pivoting member/clamping member, particularly fastening means serving adjustment purposes. The cone nut presents a cap being adapted as one-piece with the hollow cylindrical part of the cone-nut, the hollow cylindrical part being provided with a female thread in order to connect with the adjustable lock nut. The adjustable lock nut has a fastening screw and an oblong hole for the support of the holding flange. Placing the cone nut, and thus establishing the connection between the cone nut and the adjustable lock nut is only realised once the fastening screw has been tightened; however, this does not guarantee that the adjustable lock nut is centrically aligned With regard to the borehole of the glass pane. As a result, stress is introduced into the glass pane when installing the cone nut, because of the axial displacement between the cone nut and the adjustable lock nut defining the counter-plate.<br><br>
-3-<br>
In a formation of the clamping fitting according to DE 197 13 038 C2, however, unlike in DE 229 19 33 U1, in arranging a detachable cap, there is the possibility to first clamp the glass pane between the cone nut and the counter-plate without any stress, and then tighten the fastening screw by means of a suitable tool while passing through the cone nut and possibly through an axial through-opening in a counter-plate. The counter-plate may present in this case an oblong hole, or, for example in case of an angular connection, may be equipped with a threaded borehole receiving the fastening screw.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a clamping fitting of the kind mentioned above in a way that, when using a cone nut, the cap covering the head of the fastening screw is detachably arranged at the cone nut in an optimum way. Particularly the space available under the cap should not be reduced by way of the tools serving to release the cap.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a clamping component of a clamping fitting for the attachment of glass panes, comprising two clamping components clamping the glass pane between them, the clamping component presenting a cylindrical/conical exterior profile, which engages with a borehole in the glass pane and forms a taper flange, and being covered, on the outside of the glass pane, by a cap, which is in true alignment with the outside of the glass pane, which cap is detachably connected to the clamping component by means of a clip fastener disposed at the cap, as a one-piece component the clip fastener being integrated into the cap and engaging with a radially surrounding exterior groove, which is disposed in the taper flange formed by the conical exterior profile of the clamping component, a resilient ring being disposed in the radially surrounding exterior groove of the cap, which ring's external diameter is slightly larger than the cap's external diameter.<br><br>
-3A-<br>
According to this a clip fastening is utilised which is integrally formed or adapted as a one-piece component with the cap.<br>
The aforementioned integration in the cap avoids clip components additionally reducing the space existing under the cap in the area of the fastening screw.<br>
In one embodiment form, where the clip fastening is integrally formed with the cap, the invention proposes to arrange in a radial surrounding outside groove of the cap a resilient ring, which outside diameter is slightly greater than the outside diameter of the cap. This<br><br>
-4-<br>
resilient ring can be adapted as a snap ring or as an O-ring, whereby in the embodiment form as a snap: ring, the ring may comprise a plurality of straight ring sections, angled with regard to each other, which in the area of the angled section thereof respectively form so to speak small knots, protruding over the outside diameter of the cap. As a result, when seen around the circumference of the ring, there is a plurality of individual small clip fastenings, which on the one hand allow for a reliable connection of the cap with the cone nut, and on the other hand a simple release of the cap. The counter-part, so to speak, of this clip fastening is an undercut groove in the cone nut receiving the resilient ring.<br>
In the embodiment form as a one-piece component of the cap, it is proposed the cap presents at the outside circumference thereof a projection conformed to the cap and being complementary to the undercut groove of the cone nut, this projection may be replaced, unlike the surrounding arrangement, by a plurality of projections conformed to the cap and being complementary to the undercut groove of the cone nut.<br>
In the embodiment form of angular connections or pivotal connections, it has been proven to be advantageous, for example to obtain a solid bearing, the cone nut is adapted cup-like and a centered borehole is arranged in the cup bottom. In this case, a lateral tolerance allowing compensation of the clamping fitting with regard to a sub-construction or the like is not required.<br>
However, for the adaptation of a movable bearing, it is appropriate that the cone nut is likewise shaped in a cup-form, whereby an oblong hole is provided in the cup bottom, which allows for possible required lateral displacement of the fastening screw with regard to the clamping fitting. In any case, as the cap is removed, a through-hole is given in the cone nut, so that the fastening screw can be<br><br>
-5-<br>
tightened by passing through the cone nut, without introducing stress into the cone nut or into the counter-plate and thus into the glass pane.<br>
Advantageously the cap is stamped as a flat disc, allowing for convenient production through stamping method, and in a further embodiment of the invention, the material used for the cap can be preferably steel or plastic material, the utilisation of plastic material provides the possibility to produce caps of different colours.<br>
Hereinafter the invention is explained in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a plane view of a preferred embodiment form of a clamping component;<br>
Figure 2 shows the section according to line A-A of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 shows the detail Z according to figure 2;<br>
Figure 4 shows a perspective illustration of the clamping component;<br>
Figure 5 shows a perspective illustration of the cap;<br>
Figure 6 shows a plane view of the resilient ring;<br>
Figure 7 shows a plane view of another embodiment form of a clamping component;<br>
Figure 8 shows the section according to line A-A of Figure 7;<br>
Figure 9 shows the detail Z according to Figure 8;<br>
Figure 10 shows a perspective illustration of the clamping component;<br><br>

Figures 1 to 10 illustrate simply a clamping component I adapted as a cone nut 3, which is introduced from the glass pane's visible side into a borehole in the glass pane. An optional adapted counter-plate is not represented, for this purpose it is referred for example to the state-of-the art according to DE 299 19 333 U1 and DE 197 13 038 C2<br>
It becomes obvious that in an embodiment example according to DE 197 13 038 C2, the attribution of a cup bottom can be omitted, if the cone nut, unlike to De 229 19 333 U1, is directly screwed on a counter-plate, whereby, however, according to the invention, an operation of the fastening screw by passing through the cone nut is possible on account of the removable cap.<br>
The Figures 1 to 6 illustrate a preferred embodiment example, a clip fastening 13 wherein the cap 2 presents a radial surrounding outside groove 15 into which a resilient ring 16 is embedded. The outside diameter of the resilient ring is in this case slightly greater than the outside diameter of the cap 2. In the area of the cone flange 7 of the cone nut 3, an undercut groove 19 is arranged, which is engaged from the back by the resilient ring 16. According to Figure 6, the resilient ring 16 can be adapted as a snap ring 17 presenting angled ring sections 18. Another embodiment form provides for the resilient ring 16 is adapted as an O-ring, According to the embodiment example of the figures 1 to 6, the clip fastening is integral part of the cap.<br>
In another embodiment example according to the Figures 7 to 10, the clip fastening 14 is adapted as a surrounding projection 20, which is conformed as one-piece to the cap 2, and clips into the above-described undercut groove 19 of the cone nut 3 in the area of the cone flange 7. The embodiment form, according to the Figures 7 to 10, relates to a clip fastening forming a component of the cap.<br><br>
