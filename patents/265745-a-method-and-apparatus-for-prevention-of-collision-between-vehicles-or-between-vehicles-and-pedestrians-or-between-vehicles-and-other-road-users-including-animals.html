Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method and system for prevention of collision between vehicles (or) between vehicles and pedestrians (or) between vehicles and other road users including animals. Background of the Invention<br>
With the advent of the industrial age, travel increased within a local area as internationally, particularly travel over land has not only increased in speed but also in density. Which means that , at any given time not only is the movement very fast over land but there are also several competing road users , mechanized or otherwise which increase in density and frequency of traffic. The increase in traffic cause unintentional collision between road users. The increase in this kind of accidents has led to the setting up of a science by itself referred to as disaster management.<br>
A serious accident is nothing else but a man made disaster on the road. A scientific study of accidents reveals that the basic principles of the justice system as applied to accidents, particularly in countries like India skewed very much in favor of the slower and not automatically moving objects on a road. Manually moving objects such as pedestrian, a cyclist (or) an animal using the road pose a greater danger to an accident environment rather than mechanized users such as two wheelers and four wheelers. This is because pedestrians, cyclists and animals can change direction almost instantaneously as compared to vehicles such as two wheelers and four wheelers.<br>
It is known that a high percentage of accidents could be avoided by anticipated reaction by the driver. As a consequence various anti-collision systems designed to monitor the environment surrounding the motor vehicle and to indicate the presence of obstacles to the driver in particular under conditions of poor or reduced visibility, typically as a result of fog, but also as a lack of attention by the driver, have been investigated and proposed for a number of years.<br><br>
In particular various systems, either of the passive type such as television, cameras, which however have the disadvantage that they require complex computing for the determination of the distance and of the active optical type such as laser devices which however subject to atmospheric absorption, in particular in fog.<br>
The simplest known arrangements are of the fixed beam type with straight line observation of the area of the road in front of the vehicle. These arrangements have proved to be of little reliability and are subject to numerous errors, particularly on bends, because of the inability of the system to distinguish objects like pedestrian, animals, cyclist etc which actually lie in the vehicles path from objects which lie in a straight line in front of the vehicle but not in its path, such as trees growing by the edge of the road on as bend or vehicles traveling in the opposite direction.<br>
What is often forgotten in an accidental circumstance is the effect of momentum on the requirement to avoid accidents. Momentum which is equated to mass X acceleration shows that a typical four wheeler carrying a ton of load cannot come to a grinding halt, even if it is as such slow speed as 25 to 30 kms an nour which translates to about 15 to 20 mts, thus if such a vehicle carrying a ton of load was to be stopped instantaneously by jamming the brakes, this veh cle will come to a grinding halt in about 25mts. Therefore if in the fonA/ard direction of such a vehicle, a pedestrian, animal or cyclist were to suddenly change its direction in the path of the vehicle within 25mts of a vehicle even moving at 30km/hr, the vehicle and the non-motorized user such as pedestrian/cyclist is bound to be hit by the vehicle, even though the brakes may be jammed instantaneously therefore there is a need for avoiding accidents bet\Areen vehicles and particularly between non-motorized users such as pedestrians, cyclists and animals.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention envisages the use of Identification devices provided on any person coming out on to the road. Thus a pedestrian who wishes to come on to the road will be required to wear a signal generating identification device such as a bracelet, similarly cyclists and animals using the road particularly in urban areas will be required to wear such identification tags or on to bracelets which are capable of generating signals. Similarly vehicles coming on to the road will be fitted with such identification signal generating tags, such signals may be typically radiofrequency signals (or) frequency modulated signals. All signals within a given local area can be captured by means of signal capturing device which will not only read all the signals passing on a particular road way but will also read the speed of movement and direction of the signals.<br>
The signal capturing means will further fed captured signals to a signal processing device which will alert a motorized user of an obstruction in its path. In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, the signal processing means is further adapted to send a pressure accentuating signal to the braking system of a motorized vehicle. This invention therefore assures that the breaks of the motorized vehicle vyill be applied automatically to the vehicle in the event of the likelihood of the obstruction in the path of the vehicle.<br>
It is obvious that such breaks may be applied within the safe braking distance. Thus it is envisaged that on the one hand accidents will be prevented and on the other hand if an accident were to take place, the signals generated by the respective parties will be identified and therefore a hit and run accident will not remain hidden as it would be easily read from a server in which all the signals are received and stored. Hence it is believed that with this invention in the long run the number accidents will be significantly reduced. Object of the Invention<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a method for preventing accidents by collision between vehicles or between motorized and non motorized road users.<br><br>
The other object of this invention is to provide a system for preventing accidents by collision between vehicles or between motorized and non motorized road users.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a signal identification device such as tags or bracelets which is capable of generating signals for vehi(jles or motorized and non motorized road users.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a system which is capable of generating signals so as to control the brake unit which is fixed in the motor vehicles. Brief doscription of the drawings<br>
Fig:1 shows the schematic representation of the identification device in accdrdance with the present invention.<br>

Detaiiled description of the Invention<br>
As referred in Fig:1 the identification device (5) which is capable of generating signals comprises of sensors such as position sensor(1), direction sensor(2) and speed sensor(3). As the name indicates position sensor indicates the position of the vehicle, pedestrian or the animal on the road likewise direction sensors will determine the direction and speed sensor determines the speed of the &gt;^ehicle, pedestrian or the animal on the road. The inputs received from the aboN'e sensors are transmitted as radio frequency signals or frequency modulated signals (4) to the local area station. The said identification device can be in the form of tag or bracelet which can be worn by pedestrian, cyclist etc or can be placed in the vehicle or required to wear by animals. The sensors can be a scanning sensor or a collision sensor.<br>
Fig:2 shows the block diagram of the system in accordance with the invention. The identification devices as referred in Fig:1 generates the signals<br><br>
which determines the position, direction and speed of the vehicles, pedestrian, cyclists, and animals on the road and transmits the signals to the local area station.<br>
A signal capturing means (6) provided in the local area station captures the signals send by all the identification devices in that local area. An analog to digital converter (7) placed at the local area station converts the signals from analog version to digital version and fed the signals to the processor means (8). The processor means (8) is stored with a map database of the given local area.<br>
The processor means (8) correlates all the signals such as position direction and speed of vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and animals with the map stored in the database. It determines the possibility of collision between them by correlating the signals received from them. In the case vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist and animals crossed the predetermined range the processor will analyze the same and send signals (data) to the control unit.<br>
The control unit (9) will generate signals and send for conversion to digital analog converter (10) wherein the signals convert to analog form. Then the signals will be transmitted to the alarm means equipped with the vehicle to indicate the user, a possibility of collision so that to avoid an accident.<br>
Fig:3 shows the block diagram of the system which sends brake controlling signals to the vehicle to avoid collision in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
The identification device which is capable of generating signals comprises of sensors such as position sensor (1), direction sensor (2) and speed sensor (3). As the name indicated position sensor indicates the position of the vehicle, pedestrian or the animal on the road likewise direction sensors will determine the direction and speed sensor determines the speed of the vehicle, pedestrian or the animal on the road. The inputs received from the above sensors are transmitted as radio frequency signals or frequency modulated signals (4) to the local area station.<br>
A signal capturing means (6) provided in the local area station captures the signals send by all the identification devices in that local area. An analog to<br><br>
digital converter (7) placed at the local area station converts the signals from ana og version to digital version and fed the signals to the processor means (8). The processor means (8) is stored with a map database of the given local area.<br>
The processor means (8) correlates all the signals such as position direction and speed of vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and animals with the map stored in the database. It determines the possibility of collision between them by cornjiating the signals received from them. In the case vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist and animals crossed the predetermined range the processor will analyze the same and send signals (data) to the control unit.<br>
The control unit (9) will generate signals and send for conversion to digital analog converter (10) wherein the signals convert to analog form. Then the signals will be transmitted to the automatic brake control unit equipped within the vehic;le for controlling the brake. By controlling the brake the vehicle can be decelerated and collision can be avoided.<br>
