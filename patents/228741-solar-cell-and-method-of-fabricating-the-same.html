				<td>SOLAR CELL AND METHOD OF FABRICATNG THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to a solar cell capable of directly converting<br>
light energy to electric energy, and a method of fabricating the same.<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
A solar cell is a semiconductor element capable of converting light<br>
energy into electric power, known types of which include p-n junction type,<br>
PIN type and Schottky type, among which the p-n junction type is widely<br>
used. It is also possible to roughly classify the solar cell into three types,<br>
based on materials composing the substrate, such as silicon crystal-base<br>
solar cell, amorphous-silicon-base solar cell and<br>
compound-semiconductor-base solar cell. The silicon-crystal-base solar<br>
cell is further classified into single-crystal-base solar cell and<br>
polycrystal-base solar cell. The silicon-crystal-base solar cell is most<br>
disseminated, because silicon crystal substrate for producing the solar cell<br>
can be fabricated in a relatively easy manner.<br>
Output characteristics of the above-described solar cell can generally<br>
be assessed by measuring an output current-voltage curve using a solar<br>
simulator. Point Pm on the curve, giving a maximum product lp*Vp of<br>
output current Ip and output voltage Vp is referred to as maximum output Pm,<br>
and a value obtained by dividing Pm by the total light energy incident on the<br>
solar cell (S x l: S is element area and I is intensity of irradiated light):<br>
η≡{Pm/(Sx|)}x100 (%) "••(1)<br>
is defined as conversion efficiency η of the solar cell. For the purpose of<br>
raising the conversion efficiency v, it is important to increase short-circuit<br>
current Isc (output current value at V=0 on the current-voltage curve) or<br>
open-circuit voltage Voc (similarly output voltage value at l=0), and to shape<br><br>
the output current-voltage curve as being square as possible. Degree of<br>
squareness of the output current-voltage curve can generally be assessed by<br>
a fill factor (curve factor) defined by:<br>
FF≡lpmxVpm/(lscxVoc) 	(2)<br>
where, a value of FF closer to 1 means that the output current-voltage curve<br>
becomes more closer to an ideal square, and thereby the conversion<br>
efficiency η is raised.<br>
For the purpose of raising the conversion efficiency η, it is important<br>
to reduce surface recombination of carriers (electrons and holes). More<br>
specifically, in a solar cell using single crystal silicon, polysilicon or the like<br>
as a substrate, minority carriers generated by the incident light such as<br>
sunray reach the p-n junction plane mainly by diffusion, extracted as majority<br>
carriers to the external through electrodes attached on the light receiving<br>
surface and back surface, generating electric energy. In this process, some<br>
of the carriers which could possibly be extracted as current may be lost<br>
through interface states which reside in the substrate surface other than<br>
electrode surfaces, and this may lower the conversion efficiency η.<br>
Known high-efficiency solar cells therefore improve the conversion<br>
efficiency Η by protecting the light receiving surface and the back surface of<br>
the semiconductor substrate, excluding contact portions with the electrodes,<br>
with an insulating film, so as to suppress recombination of the carriers at the<br>
interface between the semiconductor substrate and the individual insulating<br>
films (so-called surface passivation effect). Silicon oxide film has long been<br>
used as this sort of insulating film, but the refractive index of which is as<br>
small as 1.4 or around, and causes a slightly large reflection loss when used<br>
on the light-receiving-surface-side. For this reason, in recent years, there<br>
has been an increasing trend in using silicon nitride, having a larger<br>
refractive index, and being excellent not only in the passivation effect but<br>
also in anti-reflection effect. The silicon nitride film has conventionally been<br>
formed by the CVD (chemical vapor deposition) process such as thermal<br><br>
CVD, plasma CVD, photo CVD and so forth. Among these, most generally<br>
disseminated is plasma CVD.<br>
A batch-type, parallel-plate plasma CVD apparatus and a single-wafer remote<br>
plasma CVD apparatus, according to the conventional art, have been described<br>
hereinafter with references to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, respectively, of the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br>
Whichever the plasma CVD process may be, there has, however,<br>
been only a little difference in that they were highly causative of plasma<br>
damage, and made formation of dangling bonds in the film more distinctive,<br><br>
so that it has been necessary to terminate the dangling bonds using a large<br>
amount of hydrogen contained in the film in view of improving the passivation<br>
effect (it has also been a natural matter of course that any known plasma<br>
CVD process was causative of inevitable incorporation of a large amount of<br>
hydrogen derived from the source gases). As a consequence,<br>
thus-obtained silicon nitride film contains hydrogen atoms to a maximum of<br>
40 at%, and is causative of time-dependent degradation in the passivation<br>
effect under sustained irradiation of light, such as sunray, containing a large<br>
energy of ultraviolet radiation.<br>
The conventional silicon nitride film formed by the plasma CVD<br>
process has also been shifted in the film composition thereof from the<br>
stoichiometric composition towards the silicon-excessive side to a<br>
considerably large degree, in order to obtain so-called field effect<br>
passivation. A large shift in the film composition towards the<br>
silicon-excessive side causes effluence of electrons produced by anion<br>
deficiency towards the semiconductor substrate so as to produce positive<br>
fixed charge on the cation side, and this results in band bending. This<br>
induces formation of an inversion layer in which electrons are excessive in<br>
the vicinity of the contact interface on the semiconductor substrate side, with<br>
which the passivation effect can be enhanced.<br>
This structure, however, suffers from large drawbacks as described<br>
below.<br>
(1)	When intended for use as a back electrode, an inversion layer 112<br>
formed in the p-type substrate 111 in the vicinity of an electrode 64 as shown<br>
in FIG. 5 tends to cause short-circuiting within an electrode surface, and this<br>
consequently results in a decrease in the generated current.<br>
(2)	The field passivation effect through formation of the inversion<br>
layer ascribable to electron effluence becomes distinctive only when the<br>
silicon nitride film is applied on the p-type layer side of the substrate. In the<br>
solar cell, carriers generated by photo-assisted excitation in p-type region<br><br>
and η-type region of the substrate are minority carriers, and it may be<br>
advantageous to use a p-type substrate, in which electrons having a long<br>
lifetime serve as the minority carriers, for the essential portion of the<br>
substrate contributive to light absorption, but this allows only a limited<br>
passivation effect to be exhibited on the light receiving surface side in which<br>
an n-type emitter layer is formed. The surface of the emitter layer is too<br>
high in the dopant concentration, so that the band bending can hardly occur<br>
only with an amount of fixed charge as much as residing in the silicon nitride<br>
film, and the field effect passivation is far from being expected. It can<br>
therefore be said that suppression of the plasma damage and consequent<br>
suppression of the interface states in the emitter layer hold the key for a<br>
desirable passivation. However, such desirable passivation cannot be<br>
obtained anyhow, because it is difficult to suppress damage by the general<br>
plasma CVD.<br>
It is therefore a subject of this invention to provide a solar cell having<br>
an insulating film excellent in the passivation effect and less causative of<br>
time-dependent degradation of the passivation effect, and a method of<br>
fabricating the same.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the above-described subject, a solar cell according<br>
to the first aspect of this invention is characterized by comprising a<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate having a light receiving surface formed on<br>
a first major surface thereof, and generating photovoltaic power based on the<br>
light irradiated on the light receiving surface, wherein the light receiving<br>
surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate is covered with a<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film provided as an inorganic<br>
insulating film composed of an inorganic insulating material having a cationic<br>
component thereof principally comprising silicon, and the<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film is configured as a<br><br>
low-hydrogen-content inorganic insulating film having a hydrogen content of<br>
less than 10 at%. It is to be noted that "a cationic component thereof<br>
principally comprising silicon" in this patent specification means that 50% or<br>
more (preferably 80% or more) of the cationic component of the inorganic<br>
insulating material is silicon. Any cation other than silicon may be<br>
contained so far as the effects of this invention described below can be<br>
achieved, without excessively impairing the insulating property of the<br>
material. For example, it is possible to introduce alkali metal ions having a<br>
large ionic radius, such as cesium ions, so as to increase the fixed charge in<br>
the film, to thereby allow them to contribute to the field effect passivation.<br>
According to the first aspect of this invention, the<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film is configured using a silicon-base<br>
insulating film having a large dielectric constant and being capable of<br>
providing a desirable passivation effect, and is also configured as a<br>
low-hydrogen-content inorganic insulating film, having a hydrogen content of<br>
less than 10 at%, so that the durability of the light-receiving-surface-side<br>
insulating film against ultraviolet radiation can be improved to a large degree.<br>
More specifically, the passivation effect of the insulating film is less likely to<br>
cause time-dependent degradation even if the solar cell is used under an<br>
environment in which a light having a large energy content of ultraviolet<br>
radiation such as a sunray and a fluorescent lamp is irradiated for a long<br>
duration of time, and the conversion efficiency Η can be maintained at a<br>
desirable value for a long period.<br>
The silicon-base insulating film can be formed by the CVD process.<br>
A method of fabricating a solar cell according to the first aspect of this<br>
invention is such as fabricating a solar cell which comprises a semiconductor<br>
solar cell substrate having a light receiving surface formed on a first major<br>
surface thereof, and also having a p-n junction generating photovoltaic<br>
power based on the light irradiated on the light receiving surface, the light<br>
receiving surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate being covered<br><br>
with a light-receiving-surface-side insulating film composed of an inorganic<br>
insulating film having a cationic component thereof principally comprising<br>
silicon, wherein the light-receiving-surface-side insulating film is formed as a<br>
low-hydrogen-content inorganic insulating film having a hydrogen content of<br>
less than 10 at%, by the catalytic CVD process in which a heat catalyst is<br>
placed together with the semiconductor solar cell substrate in a reaction<br>
vessel; and a film-forming gas, which comprises a silicon source gas and an<br>
anion source gas producing an anionic component capable of binding with<br>
silicon in an inorganic material to be obtained, at least either one of the<br>
silicon source gas and the anion source gas having hydrogen atoms in the<br>
molecule thereof, is supplied to the surface of the semiconductor solar cell<br>
substrate while making the film-forming gas into contact with the heat<br>
catalyst, so as to deposit an inorganic insulating material produced based on<br>
chemical reactions of the film-forming gas on the surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate.<br>
The catalytic CVD process per se has publicly been known in<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication "Tokkaihei" No. 10-83988, wherein a<br>
mechanism of film formation is presumed as follows:<br>
In an exemplary case where a silicon nitride film is fabricated, a mixed gas of<br>
silane (SiH4) and ammonia (NH3) is used and introduced as the film-forming<br>
gas. The heat catalyst may be any metal (or alloy) having a catalytic<br>
activity of a certain level or above, and can be configured typically by<br>
tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, titanium or vanadium. When the<br>
introduced silane gas passes over the surface of the heat catalyst heated at<br>
a predetermined temperature, a catalytic decomposition reaction of silane<br>
which resembles to adsorption dissociation reaction of hydrogen molecule<br>
can proceed, and the decomposition active species of SIH3* and H* are<br>
produced. Although a detailed mechanism remains still unclear, it is<br>
supposed that adsorption of one hydrogen composing silane onto the<br>
tungsten surface weakens the bond between the hydrogen and silicon to<br><br>
thereby decompose silane, and the absorption onto the tungsten surface is<br>
then released by heat to thereby produce the decomposition active species<br>
of SiH3* and H*. Also the ammonia gas goes through a similar catalytic<br>
reaction, to thereby produce decomposition active species of NH2* and H*.<br>
These decomposition active species reach the substrate and contribute to<br>
deposition of the silicon nitride film. This is expressed by SiH4(g)-&gt;SiH3*(g)<br>
+ H*(g), NH3(g)→NH2*(g) + H*, and aSiH3*(g) + bNH2*(g)→cSiNx(s), where<br>
the subscript g means gas state, and the subscript s means solid state. In<br>
the film formation by the catalytic CVD process, using no plasma for film<br>
formation, there are no more problems, by principle, of causing damage in<br>
the substrate surface by high-energy charged particles in the plasma which<br>
have been seen in the plasma CVD apparatus, and of causing degradation of<br>
insulating film due to inclusion of the charged particles. It is also<br>
advantageous that the substrate does not cause temperature rise unlike the<br>
case of plasma exposure, and thereby realizes the process at still lower<br>
temperatures.<br>
The catalytic CVD process adopted as described in the above makes<br>
it possible to deposit an insulating film with a less amount of interfacial<br>
defect while keeping composition thereof constant, and further makes it<br>
possible to obtain a silicon-base insulating film highly excellent in the<br>
passivation effect. The catalytic CVD process is enhanced in the reaction<br>
efficiency by virtue of a catalyst, and allows deposition of a high-quality<br>
insulating film without excessively diluting the film-forming gas with a carrier<br>
gas such as hydrogen. It is also possible to suppress the residual content<br>
of hydrogen derived from the film-forming gas. This effect will become<br>
particularly distinctive when the composition is selected so as to suppress<br>
generation of dangling bonds of silicon atoms, which can readily bind with<br>
hydrogen atoms (for an exemplary case of silicon nitride, a composition such<br>
as being not so departing in the silicon-excessive side from the<br>
stoichiometric ratio) . For this reason, the catalytic CVD process can<br><br>
readily produce a silicon-base insulating film having a hydrogen content of<br>
less than 10 at%, while still relying upon CVD process. In view of reducing<br>
the hydrogen content in the film, it is more effective to adopt a method of<br>
supplying the film-forming gas into the reaction vessel without diluting it with<br>
hydrogen.<br>
In this invention, the semiconductor solar cell substrate can be<br>
configured, similarly to that of other known solar cells, using single-crystal<br>
silicon, polysilicon, gallium arsenide, germanium or other composite<br>
materials. In view of paying a special attention to balance between the<br>
conversion efficiency and the price, it is preferable to use single-crystal<br>
silicon as the semiconductor solar cell substrate (the same will apply also to<br>
second and third aspects of this invention described later).<br>
In the first aspect of this invention, a second major surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate may be covered with a back-side<br>
insulating film provided as an inorganic insulating film composed of an<br>
inorganic insulating material having a cationic component thereof principally<br>
comprising silicon, a back electrode may be provided so as to cover the<br>
back-side insulating film and so as to contact with the back surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate through conductive portions penetrating<br>
the back-side insulating film, and the back-side insulating film may be<br>
configured as a low-hydrogen-content inorganic insulating film having a<br>
hydrogen content of less than 10 at%. In a bifacial solar cell having the<br>
back electrode not covering the entire surface of the back-side insulating film<br>
and allowing also the incident light on the back surface to contribute to power<br>
generation, the ultraviolet resistant characteristics and, consequently,<br>
time-dependent stability of the passivation effect can be improved by<br>
configuring also the back-side insulating film as a low-hydrogen-content<br>
insulating film.<br>
The hydrogen content of the low-hydrogen-content inorganic<br>
insulating film exceeding 10 at% tends to degrade the passivation effect due<br><br>
to ultraviolet irradiation, and prevents the object of this invention from being<br>
attained. On the other hand, the hydrogen content of the<br>
low-hydrogen-content inorganic insulating film suppressed beyond 1 at%<br>
results in saturation of the ultraviolet radiation resistant characteristics, and<br>
may undesirably raise the cost due to complication of the process and so<br>
forth. Therefore the hydrogen content of the low-hydrogen-content<br>
inorganic insulating film is preferably adjusted within a range from 1 at% to<br>
10 at%, both ends inclusive, and more preferably from 1 at% to 5 at%.<br>
In this invention, the silicon-base inorganic insulating material<br>
composing the light-receiving-surface-side insulating film or the back-side<br>
insulating film can specifically be composed of any one of silicon nitrides,<br>
silicon oxides and silicon oxynitrides. Of these, silicon nitride, excellent in<br>
the passivation effect, can effectively be used for this invention. Silicon<br>
nitride is also advantageous in having a large refractive index, and therefore<br>
can be used also as an anti-reflection film if it is applied to the<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film (the same will apply also to the<br>
second and third aspects of this invention described later).<br>
In particular, the light-receiving-surface-side insulating film is<br>
preferably configured as a low-hydrogen-content inorganic insulating film<br>
composed of silicon nitride having a refractive index of 2 to 2.5, both ends<br>
inclusive. The refractive index smaller than 2 results in only a<br>
non-distinctive, anti-reflection effect, whereas exceeding 2.5 induces optical<br>
absorption of the light-receiving-surface-side insulating film in the<br>
wavelength range contributive to conversion of the incident light into current,<br>
and thereby lowers the conversion efficiency. It is therefore preferable that<br>
the light-receiving-surface-side insulating film is adjusted to have a<br>
refractive index of 2 to 2.1, both ends inclusive.<br>
The refractive index of the silicon nitride film is closely related to its<br>
silicon/nitrogen atomic ratio (Si/N atomic ratio), showing a tendency of<br>
increasing the refractive index as the atomic ratio of silicon increases. In<br><br>
pursuit of adjusting the refractive index within a range from 2 to 2.5, the<br>
present inventors found through investigations that it was preferable to<br>
adjust the Si/N atomic ratio within a range from 0.80 to 1.80. This<br>
composition is close to the stoichiometric ratio of silicon nitride (Si/N=0.75),<br>
and also raises an advantage in that it is less likely to produce dangling<br>
bonds on silicon atoms, unlike the conventional case where the plasma CVD<br>
process was adopted. In cooperation with an excellent reaction efficiency<br>
of generation of silicon nitride in the catalytic CVD process, this is successful<br>
in largely reducing the residual hydrogen content in the film, derived from the<br>
film-forming gas (10 at% or less, or 5 at% or less), and in very effectively<br>
suppressing time-dependent degradation of the passivation effect under<br>
irradiation of ultraviolet radiation.<br>
For the case where the inorganic film to be obtained is the<br>
above-described silicon nitride film, it is all enough to supply the film-forming<br>
gas into the reaction vessel while adjusting the ratio of mixing of a silicon<br>
source gas and a nitrogen source gas as an anion source gas so as to obtain<br>
silicon nitride having a Si/N atomic ratio of 0.80 to 1.80, both ends inclusive.<br>
In an exemplary case where the silicon source gas is silane (defined as<br>
generally referring to silicon hydrides: specifically includes monosilane and<br>
disilane) and the nitrogen source is ammonia, the Si/N atomic ratio of the<br>
resultant silicon nitride film can be adjusted by ratio of flow rates of silane<br>
and ammonia supplied to the reaction vessel. The Si/N atomic ratio of the<br>
silicon nitride film is adjustable also by pressure of a mixed gas of the silicon<br>
source gas and the nitrogen source gas. More specifically, under a<br>
constant ratio of mixing of the silicon source gas and the nitrogen source gas,<br>
the Si/N atomic ratio of the silicon nitride film is adjustable towards the<br>
nitrogen-rich direction by increasing the gas pressure, and towards the<br>
silicon-rich direction by decreasing the gas pressure.<br>
In the first aspect of the solar cell of this invention, the back-side<br>
insulating film may be a silicon nitride film formed, so as to adjust the Si/N<br><br>
atomic ratio thereof to 0.80 to 1.80, both ends inclusive, by the catalytic CVD<br>
process in which a heat catalyst is placed together with the semiconductor<br>
solar cell substrate in a reaction vessel; and a film-forming gas, which is<br>
comprised of a silicon source gas and a nitrogen source gas, is supplied to<br>
the surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate while making the<br>
film-forming gas into contact with the heat catalyst, so as to deposit silicon<br>
nitride produced based on chemical reactions of the film-forming gas on the<br>
surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate.<br>
A second aspect of the solar cell of this invention is characterized in<br>
comprising a semiconductor solar cell substrate having a light receiving<br>
surface formed on the first major surface thereof, and generating<br>
photovoltaic power based on the light irradiated on the light receiving surface,<br>
wherein a second major surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate is<br>
covered with a back-side insulating film provided as an inorganic insulating<br>
film composed of silicon nitride, and a back electrode is provided so as to<br>
cover the back-side insulating film and so as to contact with the back surface<br>
of the semiconductor solar cell substrate through conductive portions<br>
penetrating the back-side insulating film, and<br>
wherein the silicon nitride film composing the back-side insulating film<br>
is formed so as to adjust the Si/N atomic ratio thereof to 0.80 to 1.80, both<br>
ends inclusive, by the catalytic CVD process in which a heat catalyst is<br>
placed together with the semiconductor solar cell substrate in a reaction<br>
vessel; and a film-forming gas, which comprises a silicon source gas and a<br>
nitrogen source gas, is supplied to the surface of the semiconductor solar<br>
cell substrate while making the film-forming gas into contact with the heat<br>
catalyst, so as to deposit silicon nitride produced based on chemical<br>
reactions of the film-forming gas on the surface of the semiconductor solar<br>
cell substrate.<br>
A second aspect of the method of fabricating a solar cell of this<br>
invention is characterized by a method of fabricating a solar cell which<br><br>
comprises a solar cell comprising a semiconductor solar cell substrate<br>
having a light receiving surface formed on the first major surface thereof, and<br>
generating photovoltaic power based on the light irradiated on the light<br>
receiving surface, wherein a second major surface of the semiconductor<br>
solar cell substrate is covered with a back-side insulating film provided as an<br>
inorganic insulating film composed of silicon nitride, and a back electrode is<br>
provided so as to cover the back-side insulating film so as to contact with the<br>
back surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate through conductive<br>
portions penetrating the back-side insulating film, and<br>
wherein the silicon nitride film composing the back-side insulating film<br>
is formed by the catalytic CVD process in which a heat catalyst is placed<br>
together with the semiconductor solar cell substrate in a reaction vessel; and<br>
a film-forming gas, which comprises a silicon source gas and a nitrogen<br>
source gas, is supplied to the surface of the semiconductor solar cell<br>
substrate while making the film-forming gas into contact with the heat<br>
catalyst, so as to deposit silicon nitride produced based on chemical<br>
reactions of the film-forming gas on the surface of the semiconductor solar<br>
cell substrate, while regulating the ratio of mixing of the silicon source gas<br>
and the nitrogen source gas so as to adjust the Si/N atomic ratio to 0.80 to<br>
1.80, both ends inclusive. Silane and ammonia can be used as the silicon<br>
source gas and the nitrogen source gas, as described above.<br>
The back-side insulating film formed, by the catalytic CVD process as<br>
described in the above, as the silicon nitride film having a Si/N atomic ratio of<br>
0.8 to 1.80 raises additional effects specific to the back-side insulating film,<br>
as described below. That is, adoption of the catalytic CVD process makes it<br>
possible to form the silicon nitride film, having the Si/N atomic ratio close to<br>
the stoichiometric composition as described in the above, as a low-defect<br>
film having only a small amount of dangling bonds. The film of this sort,<br>
having a composition close to the stoichiometric ratio, has a less amount of<br>
fixed charge ascribable to electrons caused by excessive silicon, and is less<br><br>
causative of band bending even if it is bonded to the back surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate. An inversion layer formed on the<br>
substrate side can therefore be thinned, and this makes short-circuiting<br>
within the electrode surface of the back electrode, as shown in FIG. 5, very<br>
unlikely to occur. The film is less causative of defects like dangling bonds<br>
possibly providing sites for surface recombination, and is therefore<br>
successful in obtaining a desirable passivation effect. Adjustment of the<br>
Si/N atomic ratio of the silicon nitride film within a range from 0.80 to 1.80<br>
also makes it possible to reduce the hydrogen content, so that, similarly to<br>
the case of the light-receiving-surface-side insulating film, the ultraviolet<br>
resistant characteristics and, consequently, time-dependent stability of the<br>
passivation effect of the back-side insulating film can be improved, in a<br>
bifacial solar cell having the back electrode not covering the entire surface of<br>
the back-side insulating film and allowing also the incident light on the back<br>
surface to contribute to power generation.<br>
Because the low-defect, high-quality silicon nitride film having a<br>
composition expressed by a Si/N atomic ratio of 0.80 to 1.80, close to the<br>
stoichiometric ratio, can be obtained by the catalytic CVD process as<br>
described above, a desirable passivation effect can be obtained without<br>
relying upon the field-effect passivation effect which is contributed by<br>
polarity of the inversion layer, and consequently the silicon nitride film can be<br>
used both as an insulating film on the light-receiving surface side and as an<br>
insulating film on the back side, unlike the silicon-excessive silicon nitride<br>
film, and can exhibit the specific effects for both sides.<br>
Next, in the first and second aspects of the solar cell and the method<br>
of fabricating the same according to this invention, the inorganic insulating<br>
film can be deposited by the catalytic CVD process on the surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate after being surface-treated by introducing<br>
a surface treatment gas into the reaction vessel, and by supplying the<br>
surface treatment gas to the surface of the semiconductor solar cell<br><br>
substrate so as to effect the surface treatment, while making the film-forming<br>
gas come into contact with the heat catalyst. The general plasma CVD<br>
process results in formation of a trace amount of an oxygen-containing<br>
transition layer between the substrate and the insulating film, which is, for<br>
example, a silicon oxynitride film for the case of silicon nitride film, causative<br>
of formation of interfacial defects, whereas the above-described surface<br>
treatment can effectively remove the transition layer, can more effectively<br>
suppress the formation of interfacial defects, and can more effectively<br>
prevent the conversion efficiency of the solar cell from degrading due to<br>
surface recombination. For the case where the semiconductor solar cell<br>
substrate is a silicon substrate and the inorganic insulating film is a silicon<br>
nitride film, it is appropriate to use, for example, ammonia gas as the surface<br>
treatment gas.<br>
In the first and second aspects of the solar cell and the method of<br>
fabricating the same according to this invention, the inorganic insulating film<br>
may be deposited by the catalytic CVD process on the surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate, and may be post-treated by introducing a<br>
post-treatment gas into the reaction vessel, and by supplying the<br>
post-treatment gas to the surface of the inorganic insulating film, while<br>
keeping the post-treatment gas in contact with the heat catalyst.<br>
Furthermore, a third aspect of the solar cell according to this<br>
invention is characterized in comprising a semiconductor solar cell substrate<br>
having a light receiving surface formed on the first major surface thereof, and<br>
generating photovoltaic power based on the light irradiated on the light<br>
receiving surface, wherein a second major surface of the semiconductor<br>
solar cell substrate is covered with a back-side insulating film composed of<br>
an inorganic insulating film having a cationic component thereof principally<br>
comprising silicon, and a back electrode is provided so as to cover the<br>
back-side insulating film and so as to contact with the back surface of the<br><br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate through conductive portions penetrating<br>
the back-side insulating film, and<br>
wherein the inorganic insulating film is such as being deposited and<br>
formed by the catalytic CVD process in which a heat catalyst is placed<br>
together with the semiconductor solar cell substrate in a reaction vessel; and<br>
a film-forming gas, which comprises a silicon source gas and an anion<br>
source gas producing an anionic component capable of binding with silicon<br>
in an inorganic material to be obtained, is supplied to the surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate while making the film-forming gas into<br>
contact with the heat catalyst, so as to deposit an inorganic insulating<br>
material produced based on chemical reactions of the film-forming gas on<br>
the surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate; and such as being<br>
post-treated by introducing a post-treatment gas into the reaction vessel,<br>
and by supplying the post-treatment gas to the surface of the inorganic<br>
insulating film, while keeping the post-treatment gas in contact with the heat<br>
catalyst.<br>
Moreover, a third aspect of the method of fabricating a solar cell<br>
according to this invention is characterized by a method of fabricating a solar<br>
cell which comprises a semiconductor solar cell substrate having a light<br>
receiving surface formed on a first major surface thereof, and generating<br>
photovoltaic power based on the light irradiated on the light receiving surface,<br>
wherein a second major surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate is<br>
covered with a back-side insulating film composed of an inorganic insulating<br>
film having a cationic component thereof principally comprising silicon, and a<br>
back electrode is provided so as to cover the back-side insulating film so as<br>
to contact with the back surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate<br>
through conductive portions penetrating the back-side insulating film, and<br>
wherein the inorganic insulating film is deposited and formed by the<br>
catalytic CVD process in which a heat catalyst is placed together with the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate in a reaction vessel; and a film-forming<br><br>
gas, which comprises a silicon source gas and an anion source gas<br>
producing an anionic component capable of binding with silicon in an<br>
inorganic material to be obtained, is supplied to the surface of the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate while making the film-forming gas into<br>
contact with the heat catalyst; so as to deposit an inorganic insulating<br>
material produced based on chemical reactions of the film-forming gas on<br>
the surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate; and is then<br>
post-treated by introducing a post-treatment gas into the reaction vessel,<br>
and by supplying the post-treatment gas to the surface of the inorganic<br>
insulating film, while keeping the post-treatment gas in contact with the heat<br>
catalyst.<br>
The present inventors found that the passivation characteristic of the<br>
insulating film can further be improved by surface-treating the inorganic<br>
insulating film, after being deposited, by supplying the post-treatment gas to<br>
the surface thereof, while allowing the post-treatment gas to cause catalytic<br>
decomposition reaction with the aid of the heat catalyst, similarly to as in the<br>
above-described surface treatment. It is to be noted that the post-treatment<br>
after the film formation, proceeded in a hydrogen atmosphere under heating<br>
without using any catalyst, has already been known as hydrogen annealing,<br>
whereas the catalyst-assisted method of this invention is far superior thereto<br>
in the passivation effect. This is supposedly because decomposition<br>
chemical species are intentionally produced by the catalytic reaction in the<br>
process chamber, and the decomposition chemical species can diffuse into<br>
the insulating film to thereby terminate the dangling bonds. According to<br>
this method, it is also allowable to lower the substrate temperature than in<br>
the general hydrogen annealing, and this raises another advantage of<br>
ensuring a more stable post-treatment as compared with the hydrogen<br>
annealing, without impairing contact characteristic between the electrodes<br>
and the substrate.<br><br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 3 schematically shows a batch-type, parallel-plate plasma CVD apparatus,<br>
generally called a direct plasma CVD. The apparatus comprises a reaction vessel 1<br>
equipped with an evacuation device 11, substrate holders 81 placing solar cell<br>
substrates 20 at predetermined positions in the reaction vessel 1, film forming gas<br>
introducing ducts 31, 32 introducing predetermined film-forming gases, which are<br>
reactive gases, into the reaction vessel 1, a high-frequency power source 82<br>
generating plasma by energizing the introduced gas, and a resistance-heating heater<br>
90 keeping a deposition atmosphere at a constant temperature. In the process of film<br>
deposition using this apparatus, predetermined film-forming gases are introduced into<br>
the reaction vessel 1 at predetermined flow rates through the film forming gas<br>
introducing ducts 31, 32, and the high-frequency power source 82 is then operated to<br>
set a high-frequency electric field. By this operation, a high-frequency discharge<br>
occurs between the substrate holders 81, thereby the film-forming gases are excited to<br>
produce a plasma, and an insulating film to be obtained is formed on the surface of the<br>
substrates 20 making use of reactions proceeded in the plasma. In an exemplary case<br>
where a silicon nitride film is formed as the insulating film, silane is introduced through<br><br>
the film forming gas introducing duct 31, and ammonia is introduced through the film<br>
forming gas introducing duct 32, as the film-forming gases, the both are mixed and<br>
then supplied to the reaction vessel 1, so as to produce the silicon nitride film making<br>
use of decomposition reaction and so forth of silane in the plasma.<br>
The plasma CVD is widely applied to processes of fabricating solar cells<br>
because it can ensure a relatively high deposition rate even under a substrate<br>
temperature of relatively as low as 400°C. The process, however, raises a problem in<br>
that high-energy charged particles produced in the plasma are highly causative of<br>
damages of the deposited film or the surface of the substrates (so-called plasma<br>
damage), so that the obtained silicon nitride film tends to have a large interface state<br>
density, and consequently results in only a poor passivation effect. This is also highly<br>
affective to various characteristics of the solar cell.<br>
There has, therefore, been proposed a CVD process making use of an ECR<br>
(electron cyclotron resonance) plasma as a method suppressed in the plasma<br>
damage. FIG. 4 schematically shows an exemplary apparatus used therefor. Unlike<br>
the conventional plasma CVD process, this method is characterized in that the surface<br>
of the substrate to be treated is placed apart from a plasma region (plasma zone) so<br>
as to make use of radical species in a separated manner, allowing this method to be<br>
referred to as "remote plasma CVD", hereinafter. More specifically, a predetermined<br>
film-forming gas is introduced into a pre-chamber 101 at a predetermined flow rate<br>
through a film forming gas introducing duct 31, and microwaves, in place of high-<br>
frequency electric field, are applied to the pre-chamber 101 using a microwave<br>
generator 102. The microwaves raise the plasma of the film-forming gas, used also as<br>
a carrier gas, and generates reactive species. The reactive species flow into the<br>
process chamber 1, and causes chemical reactions with the other film-forming gas<br>
supplied through the film forming gas introducing duct 32, thereby an insulating film is<br>
formed on the surface of the substrate 20. In an exemplary case where a silicon<br>
nitride film is formed as the insulating film, ammonia as a film-forming gas, used also<br>
as a carrier gas, is introduced through the film forming gas introducing duct 31, and<br><br>
silane is introduced through the introducing duct 32, the both are mixed, so as to<br>
produce the silicon nitride film making use of ammonia decomposition reaction and so<br>
forth in the plasma. The remote plasma CVD is partially successful in reducing the<br>
plasma damage.<br>
FIG. 1 is a sectional view schematically showing the best mode for<br>
carrying out the solar cell of this invention. The solar cell 100 comprises a<br>
first-conductivity-type silicon single crystal substrate 66 (simply referred to<br>
as substrate 66 hereinafter; defined as p-type in this embodiment) as the<br>
semiconductor solar cell substrate, having on the first major surface of which<br>
a second-conductivity-type emitter layer 65 (defined as of n-type in this<br>
embodiment) formed thereon, and thereby having a p-n junction plane 167 in<br>
the in-plane direction. The emitter layer 65 has, as being formed on the<br>
major surface thereof, electrodes 63 for extracting output. Because the<br>
emitter layer 65 forms the light-receiving surface of the solar cell, the<br>
electrodes can be configured using Al, Ag or the like, as having a wide bus<br>
bar electrode reducing the internal resistance, formed at appropriate<br>
intervals, and finger electrodes branched from the bus bar electrode at<br>
predetermined intervals in a comb-like form. Non-formation area of the<br>
emitter layer 65 having no electrode 63 formed therein is covered with a<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film 61 composed of silicon nitride.<br>
On the other hand, a second major surface (back surface) of the<br>
substrate 66 is covered with a back-side insulating film 62 composed of<br><br>
silicon nitride, and the entire surface of the back-side insulating film 62 is<br>
covered with back electrode 64. The back electrode 64 is brought into<br>
electrical contact with the back surface of the substrate 66 through<br>
conductive portions (contact holes 67) penetrating the back-side insulating<br>
film 62.<br>
The silicon single crystal substrate 66 may be fabricated by either of<br>
the FZ (floating zone melting) method and the Czochralski method. It is<br>
also allowable to use a GaAs single crystal substrate or a polysilicon<br>
substrate in place of the silicon single crystal substrate 66. The silicon<br>
single crystal substrate 66 used herein may be a p-type substrate doped with<br>
a Group III element such as boron or gallium during the fabrication, or may<br>
be an n-type substrate doped with a Group V element such as phosphorus or<br>
arsenic, wherein this invention adopts the p-type substrate as described in<br>
the above. Resistivity of the substrate is preferably adjusted to 0.1 Ω.cm to<br>
10 Ω'cm, both ends inclusive, and more preferably 0.5 Ω-cm to 2 Ω-cm,<br>
both ends inclusive, in view of realizing a high-performance solar cell. The<br>
thickness of the substrate of as thick as 50 µm makes it possible to catch the<br>
incident light within the solar cell and is advantageous in terms of cost, but it<br>
is preferable to adjust it to 150 to 300 µm in view of ensuring a sufficient<br>
strength durable in the succeeding processes for the substrate.<br>
The light-receiving-surface-side insulating film 61 is configured as a<br>
low-hydrogen-content inorganic insulating film having a hydrogen content of<br>
1 at% to 10 at%, more preferably 1 at% to 5 at%, both ends inclusive.<br>
Refractive index of the film is 2 to 2.5, both ends inclusive, allowing the film<br>
to be used also as an anti-reflection film. Si/N atomic ratio of the film is<br>
adjusted to 0.80 to 1.80, both ends inclusive. On the other hand, the<br>
back-side insulating film 62 is also configured as a silicon nitride film having<br>
a Si/N atomic ratio of 0.80 to 1.80, both ends inclusive (in this embodiment,<br>
the refractive index is 2 to 2.5, and the hydrogen content is 1 at% to 10 at%,<br>
more preferably 1 at% to 5 at%, both ends inclusive). Both of these films<br><br>
were formed by the catalytic CVD process in which a heat catalyst was<br>
placed together with the semiconductor solar cell substrate in a reaction<br>
vessel; and a film-forming gas, which comprised a silicon source gas and a<br>
nitrogen source gas, was supplied to the surface of the substrate while<br>
making the film-forming gas into contact with the heat" catalyst, so as to<br>
deposit silicon nitride produced based on chemical reactions of the<br>
film-forming gas on the surface of the substrate.<br>
Details of the film formation by the catalytic CVD process are publicly<br>
known, for example, by the aforementioned Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Publication "Tokkaihei" No. 10-83988 and ditto No. 8-250438, so that only a<br>
brief explanation will be given below. FIG. 2 is a schematic drawing of a film<br>
forming apparatus applicable to this invention. The film forming apparatus<br>
200 comprises a reaction vessel 1 of which inner space is reduced in the<br>
pressure by an evacuation device 11, wherein a substrate 20 is placed on a<br>
substrate holder 21 provided in the reaction vessel 1. The substrate 20 on<br>
the substrate holder 21 is heated by a substrate heater 22 (built in the<br>
substrate holder 21 in this embodiment). The reaction vessel 1 further<br>
comprises film forming gas introducing ducts 31, 32 introducing film-forming<br>
gases thereinto, a surface treatment gas introducing duct 33 introducing a<br>
surface-treatment gas thereinto, heat catalyst 50 provided in the vessel so<br>
as to oppose with the substrate 20 on the substrate holder 21, and the<br>
heat-catalyst-heating power source 51 heating, under current supply, the<br>
heat catalyst 50.<br>
The evacuation device 11 comprises a multi-step vacuum pump<br>
comprising a turbo molecular pump, a rotary pump and so forth, and is<br>
designed to reduce the pressure in the process chamber to as low as<br>
aboutIO'8 Torr. The film forming gas introducing ducts 31, 32 are connected<br>
to a disk-formed gas introducing head 35 introducing the film forming gas<br>
therethrough into the process chamber. The gas introducing head 35 has a<br>
hollow body, and has a number of gas blow holes on the front surface, so as<br><br>
to supply the film-forming gas through the gas blow holes down to the major<br>
surface (film forming surface) of the substrate 20.<br>
Heat catalyst 50 is disposed on the flow path of the film-forming gas<br>
streaming from the gas introducing head 35 towards the substrate 20, and is<br>
heated by a heat-catalyst-heating power source 51 to a catalyst activation<br>
temperature, to as high as 170°C, for example. The supplied film-forming<br>
gas reaches the major surface of the substrate while being made into contact<br>
with the heat catalyst 50. The film forming gas under the contact therewith<br>
is enhanced to cause reactions such as decomposition so as to produce<br>
reaction active species, and allows an insulating material to deposit on the<br>
substrate 20. Heat catalyst 50 in this embodiment is made of a tungsten<br>
wire having a diameter of 0.5 mm or around, processed to have a saw tooth<br>
form, for example, so as to cover an area wider than the substrate 20. The<br>
substrate temperature may be as relatively low as 200°C to 400°C, which is<br>
not causative of degradation in the contact characteristics with respect to the<br>
substrate 66, even after the electrodes 63, 64 are formed thereon.<br>
As described in the above, adoption of the catalytic CVD process<br>
using the heat catalyst 50 enables film formation without using plasma unlike<br>
the conventional process, so that any plasma damages on the surface of the<br>
substrate and degradation of the insulating film due to invasion of charged<br>
particles are avoidable by principle.<br>
Process steps for the film formation are almost same for both of the<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film 61 and the back-side insulating<br>
film. Si/N atomic ratio of the silicon nitride film can be adjusted with the<br>
above-described range, by monitoring flow rates of silane and ammonia<br>
introduced respectively through the film forming gas introducing ducts 31, 32,<br>
such as a mass flow controller (not illustrated in the figure), and by<br>
controlling ratio of the flow rates using valves 31v, 32v. Silane and<br>
ammonia herein are not diluted by hydrogen gas.<br><br>
Heat catalyst 50 is also used for the surface treatment of the<br>
substrate prior to the film formation for the purpose of reducing interfacial<br>
defects. For an exemplary case using the substrate 20 composed of silicon<br>
single crystal, the surface of the substrate is generally covered with a native<br>
oxide film. Even if the native oxide film on the surface of the substrate 20<br>
should preliminarily be removed using hydrofluoric acid or the like, oxidation<br>
readily proceeds under normal atmospheres, so that silicon atom species<br>
having oxygen atoms bonded thereto remain more or less on the surface of<br>
the substrate. For this reason, ammonia gas as the surface treatment gas<br>
is introduced, prior to formation of the insulating film, through the surface<br>
treatment gas introducing duct 33 via the introducing head 35 into the<br>
reaction vessel 1. The ammonia gas is then converted into the active<br>
species by the catalytic decomposition reaction with the aid of heat catalyst<br>
50, and oxygen atoms (which possibly serve as sites for surface<br>
recombination) of the native oxide film covering the surface of the substrate<br>
are substituted by nitrogen atoms which are constituent atoms of the<br>
insulating film composed of silicon nitride. The film formation process of<br>
the insulating film is subsequently carried out by the catalytic CVD process<br>
already explained in the above. This method makes it possible to deposit<br>
the insulating film with less amount of interfacial defects while keeping the<br>
composition thereof uniform.<br>
The surface treatment gas introducing duct 33 is necessary for the<br>
purpose of carrying out the surface treatment, but it is allowable to use the<br>
film forming gas introducing duct 31 also as the surface treatment gas<br>
introducing duct, for the case where a gas, same as the film-forming gas, is<br>
used also as the surface treatment gas, such as the case in which the<br>
film-forming gas is a mixed gas of silane (silicon source gas) and ammonia<br>
(nitrogen source gas: anion source gas), and the surface treatment gas is<br>
ammonia gas. The nitrogen source gas, other than the ammonia gas,<br>
applicable to formation of the silicon nitride film may be nitrogen gas or any<br><br>
other nitrogen compound gas. In the configuration of the apparatus shown<br>
in FIG. 2, also the surface treatment gas is supplied to the substrate 20<br>
through the gas introduction head 35 similarly to the film-forming gas,<br>
allowed to pass in the vicinity of the surface of the heat catalyst 50 so as to<br>
cause the catalytic decomposition reaction as described in the above, and<br>
thereby to promote the above-described surface treatment reaction for the<br>
substrate 20.<br>
Heat catalyst 50 is also used for post-treatment for improving the<br>
passivation characteristics of the grown insulating film. More specifically,<br>
the characteristics of the insulating film can further be improved by<br>
introducing the post-treatment gas such as ammonia gas or hydrogen gas<br>
through the post-treatment gas introducing duct 34 after deposition of the<br>
insulating film, and by inducing the catalytic decomposition reaction with the<br>
aid of the heat catalyst 50, similarly to as in the surface treatment, to thereby<br>
effect the post-treatment. Hydrogen annealing, publicly known as the<br>
post-treatment, is carried out under a hydrogen atmosphere while heating<br>
the substrate at 300 to 500°C, whereas the aforementioned post-treatment is<br>
completely different therefrom in that the decomposition chemical species<br>
are intentionally generated in the process chamber with the aid of the heat<br>
catalyst 50, wherein the passivation characteristics are supposedly improved<br>
by decomposition chemical species which diffuse into the insulating film and<br>
terminate the dangling bonds. This method also makes it possible to lower<br>
the substrate temperature than in the general hydrogen annealing (typically<br>
at 200°C to 400°C, both ends inclusive), so that there is no fear of impairing<br>
the contact characteristics between the substrate 66 and the electrodes 63,<br>
64 shown in FIG. 1, even if the insulating film is formed after the electrodes<br>
63, 64. In some cases, the hydrogen content of the film may slightly<br>
increase during the post-treatment, but the amount of increase in most cases<br>
falls within a range from 1 at% to 3 at%, so that the final hydrogen content of<br><br>
the film never exceeds 10 at% so far as the hydrogen content of the<br>
as-deposited film is suppressed to as low as 5 at% or less.<br>
The following paragraphs will describe exemplary process steps of<br>
fabricating the solar cell 100 shown in FIG. 1 (although the description herein<br>
will be made on the case using a p-type substrate, other situations using an<br>
n-type substrate can be understood by reading "n+" as "p+", allowing<br>
differences in the physical characteristic values). The method of fabricating<br>
the solar cell described hereinafter is only one example, and is never limited<br>
thereto. First, the single crystal silicon substrate (FZ process, B-doped) 66<br>
having (100) substrate orientation is subjected to an anisotropic alkali<br>
etching called texture etching, to thereby form a pyramid-shaped fine surface<br>
texture on the surface thereof. The etching generally adopts a mixture of<br>
sodium hydroxide and an alcohol, or an aqueous solution having potassium<br>
carbonate or sodium carbonate dissolved therein, producing the surface<br>
texture of as large as 1 to 10 urn. The incident light on the light-receiving<br>
surface is effectively introduced into the substrate, after being reflected<br>
multiple times by virtue of the texture.<br>
An n+ layer, or the emitter layer 65, is then formed. Generally, a<br>
Group V element, represented by phosphorus, is doped by a publicly-known<br>
method such as thermal diffusion or ion implantation. The surface impurity<br>
concentration of the dopant in the n+ layer is preferably adjusted so as to<br>
adjust the sheet resistance to 40 to 200 Ω/⁮⁮⁮⁮‫‮⁪□ The back-side insulating film<br>
62 composed of silicon nitride is then formed on the entire back surface of<br>
the substrate by the above-described catalytic CVD process, portions thereof<br>
corresponded to the contact holes 67 are then removed by a method such as<br>
photolithography, mechanical cutting, laser abrasion or the like, and the back<br>
electrode 64 typically composed of Al is deposited by the vacuum<br>
evaporation process, sputtering or the like. On the other hand on the<br>
light-receiving-surface side of the substrate 66, phosphorus glass and so<br>
forth, deposited during diffusion for forming the emitter layer 65, is removed<br><br>
by etching, the surface electrodes 63 are deposited typically by vacuum<br>
evaporation through a mask, and thereafter the light-receiving-surface-side<br>
insulating film 61 composed of silicon nitride is formed by the similar catalytic<br>
CVD process.<br>
In many cases, the passivation characteristics of general<br>
semiconductor devices are evaluated by forming a<br>
metal/insulator/semiconductor stacked structure (MIS structure) and by<br>
measuring the capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics. In the solar cell,<br>
as discussed based on the extended Schockley-Read-Hall surface<br>
recombination model, effective recombination velocity is affected by<br>
interface state density, fixed charge in the film, electron- and hole-capture<br>
cross sections, substrate impurity concentration, carrier dose and so forth.<br>
On the experimental basis, a history of the substrate also affects results of<br>
the measurement, because a hysteresis effect may appear in the C-V<br>
measurement due to hole trapping by dangling bonds in the silicon nitride<br>
film, and the trapped holes may be released by an external factor such as<br>
ultraviolet irradiation. It is therefore difficult to understand actual operation<br>
state of the solar cell, only based on the interface state density and the<br>
in-film fixed charge obtained from the C-V characteristics in the dark state.<br>
In the evaluation of the passivation effect for the back surface, it is therefore<br>
a general practice to estimate effective surface recombination velocity by<br>
simulating the operation state of the solar cell while reproducing carrier<br>
injection state under irradiation of a sample to be measured with a bias light,<br>
and by measuring the effective life time using a life time scanner. On the<br>
other hand, the light-receiving-surface side, that is, the emitter layer 65 side<br>
causes lowering in sensitivity of the C-V measurement or DLTS<br>
measurement because of high concentration of a doped impurity, and the<br>
depth-wise concentration distribution caused by diffusion makes it difficult to<br>
analyze the effective surface recombination velocity. Therefore in many<br><br>
cases, the passivation performance on the light-receiving-surface side is<br>
evaluated based on performance of an actually fabricated solar cell.<br>
The conventional plasma CVD process was causative of a heavy<br>
plasma damage as described in the above, and it was therefore necessary to<br>
intentionally introduce a large amount of hydrogen into the film so as to<br>
terminate the dangling bonds. Whereas in this invention, the plasma<br>
damage to the substrate is avoidable by forming the<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film 61 by the catalytic CVD process,<br>
and thereby highly desirable passivation characteristics can be obtained. A<br>
less possibility of producing the dangling bonds due to the plasma damage<br>
also makes it no more necessary to intentionally introduce hydrogen into the<br>
film, and makes it possible to adopt a film composition close to the<br>
stoichiometric composition (Si/N atomic ratio=0.75) of silicon nitride, so that<br>
the film is far better in the ultraviolet resistance characteristics than the<br>
silicon nitride film having a large amount of hydrogen introduced therein by<br>
the plasma CVD process.<br>
No need of largely shifting the composition of the silicon nitride film<br>
from the stoichiometric ratio towards the silicon-excessive side raises an<br>
effect from another point of view, for the case where the film is adopted to the<br>
back-side insulating film 64, of which ultraviolet radiation resistance is of no<br>
importance than on the light-receiving-surface side. More specifically, the<br>
film composition, not being excessively shifted towards the silicon-excessive<br>
side, is successful in suppressing formation of a large inversion layer, as<br>
shown in FIG. 5, on the substrate 66 side in the vicinity of contact interface.<br>
This effectively prevents in-plane short circuiting via the back electrode 64,<br>
and raises the conversion efficiency.<br>
In the film formation by the catalytic CVD process, selection of the<br>
temperature of film formation is a critical issue. In an exemplary case<br>
where the light-receiving-surface-side insulating layer 61 is formed as an<br>
anti-reflection film, the temperature of film formation is preferably set to<br><br>
about 200°C to 400°C, wherein the temperature as high as possible is<br>
preferable in view of the passivation characteristics, because defects in the<br>
film to be deposited will further be decreased. It is also preferable to keep<br>
the temperature of the substrate 66 below a temperature causative of<br>
thermal modification both in terms of material and of structure. In an<br>
exemplary case where the electrodes 63 are formed as Al electrodes on the<br>
light-receiving-surface-side insulating film 61 in a MIS contact manner,<br>
although being brought into contact with the emitter layer 65 in FIG. 1, the<br>
temperature of film formation exceeding 400°C results in spiking of the Al<br>
electrodes penetrating the emitter layer, to thereby degrade the performance<br>
due to short circuiting. It is therefore preferable to adjust the temperature<br>
of film formation to 400°C or below.<br>
For the case where the above-described surface treatment precedes<br>
the film formation, the temperature of the heat catalyst 50 is preferably equal<br>
to or lower than the catalyst temperature during the film formation, and is<br>
generally adjusted within a range from 1,000 to 1,700°C. Any<br>
post-treatment after the film formation is preferably carried out under the<br>
temperature of the heat catalyst 50 similar to the conditions of the surface<br>
treatment, wherein addition of, or substitution by the general hydrogen<br>
annealing is also allowable so far as the contact characteristics of the<br>
substrate, or between the electrodes and the substrate are not impaired.<br>
It is also allowable to form the back-side insulating layer as a general<br>
thermal oxide film. In this case, any publicly-known technique such as dry<br>
oxidation, wet oxidation, pyrogenic oxidation or the like is applicable.<br>
Because the substrate in this process is oxidized on both surfaces thereof, a<br>
photo resist is coated on the back surface and dried, the oxide film on the<br>
light-receiving-surface-side is removed using a dilute hydrofluoric acid or the<br>
like, and the photo resist is then removed. By this process, insulating film<br>
62, on the back surface is formed.<br><br>
The following paragraphs will describe results of experiments carried<br>
out in order to confirm the effects of this invention.<br>
(Experiment 1)<br>
A 3-inch circular (100) single crystal silicon substrate (FZ method, B<br>
doped) having a resistivity of 1.5 Ωcm was cleaned with 2% hydrofluoric acid<br>
for 1 minute, rinsed with ultra-pure water for 5 minutes, and dried by blowing<br>
a dry nitrogen. Thereafter a silicon nitride film of 80 nm thick, having a<br>
refractive index of 2.4 (Si/N atomic ratio=1.48: without hydrogen dilution),<br>
was formed on both surfaces thereof by the catalytic CVD process. Next,<br>
an effective lifetime was measured using a lifetime scanner while irradiating<br>
a white bias light of 0.5 sun, and the surface recombination velocity was<br>
calculated on the basis of a result of lifetime measurement of the same<br>
substrate but subjected to chemical passivation (iodine/ethanol treatment).<br>
On the other hand, using a 400-W metal halogen lamp as a light source, one<br>
surface of the sample was exposed to ultraviolet radiation, from which<br>
wavelength component of 320 nm or shorter is cut by a filter, for 32 hours<br>
and 128 hours, and the surface recombination velocity was similarly<br>
calculated. Hydrogen content of the silicon nitride film was analyzed by the<br>
FT-IR method.<br>
(Experiment 2)<br>
The silicon substrate was cleaned and dried according to the<br>
procedures similar to as described in Experiment 1, and by the catalytic CVD<br>
process, the substrate was surface-treated using ammonia gas, on both<br>
surfaces of which the silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.4 was<br>
deposited, and then a similar measurement was carried out.<br>
(Experiment 3)<br><br>
The silicon substrate was cleaned and dried according to the<br>
procedures similar to as described in Experiment 1, and by the catalytic CVD<br>
process, the substrate was surface-treated using ammonia gas, on both<br>
surfaces of which the silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.4 was<br>
deposited, post-treated using hydrogen gas, and then a similar measurement<br>
was carried out.<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
The silicon substrate was cleaned and dried according to the<br>
procedures similar to as described in Experiment 1, and on both surfaces of<br>
which the silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.4 was deposited by<br>
the direct plasma CVD process (frequency 100 kHz: without hydrogen<br>
dilution), and then the similar measurement was carried out.<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
The silicon substrate was cleaned and dried according to the<br>
procedures similar to as described in Experiment 1, and on both surfaces of<br>
which the silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.4 was deposited by<br>
the remote plasma CVD process (microwave 2.5 GHz: without hydrogen<br>
dilution), and then the similar measurement was carried out.<br>
Results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
It is found from the results that all samples of Examples 1 to 3, having<br>
the silicon nitride films thereof formed by the catalytic CVD process, showed<br>
hydrogen contents of the film of as small as 5 at% or less, and showed only<br>
small amounts of increase in the effective surface recombination velocity<br>
even under sustained ultraviolet irradiation. In other words, they are found<br>
to be excellent in the ultraviolet radiation resistant characteristics.<br>
Whereas, each of the samples of the Comparative Examples 1 and 2 making<br>
use of the plasma CVD process showed an extremely high hydrogen content<br>
of the film and a sharp increase in the effective surface recombination<br>
velocity under sustained ultraviolet radiation, proving inferiority to the results<br>
of Experiments 1 to 3.<br>
(Experiment 4)<br>
A quasi-square (100) single crystal silicon substrate (FZ process,<br>
B-doped) having a resistivity of 0.5 Ωcm, a thickness of 300 µm and a planar<br>
size of 100 mmx100 mm was etched in a concentrated aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution to remove damages, and on the entire surface of which a<br>
texture was formed in a mixed solution of aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution/isopropanol. The substrate was subjected to the RCA cleaning,<br>
oxidized at a high temperature (1,000°C), protected on one surface of which<br>
with a photo resist, and only one surface of the oxide film was etched in a<br>
buffered hydrofluoric acid solution. After the photo resist was removed,<br>
phosphorus was diffused at 830°C using phosphorus oxychloride as a source<br>
so as to adjust sheet resistance of the surface to 100 Ω/‫‮⁪□. A phosphorus<br>
glass formed on the surface was then removed using a 2% hydrofluoric acid,<br>
and light-receiving-surface side electrodes (Ti/Pd/Ag) were formed by<br>
vacuum evaporation through a mask. The back surface was subjected to<br>
machining to form trenches, and thereon the back electrode (Al) was<br>
vacuum-deposited. Thereafter, a silicon nitride film having a refractive<br>
index of 2.1 (Si/N atomic ratio=1.04: without hydrogen dilution) and a<br><br>
thickness of 80 nm was deposited on the light-receiving-surface side by the<br>
catalytic CVD process. Characteristics of thus-obtained solar cell were<br>
measured using a solar simulator (1.5 sun).<br>
(Experiment'5)<br>
Process steps up to the formation of the back electrode were carried<br>
out similarly to as described in Experiment 4, the light-receiving surface side<br>
was surface treated using ammonia gas by the catalytic CVD process, a<br>
silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.1 was deposited thereon,<br>
and a similar measurement was carried out.<br>
(Experiment 6)<br>
Process steps up to the formation of the back electrode were carried<br>
out similarly to as described in Experiment 4, the light-receiving surface side<br>
was surface treated using ammonia gas by the catalytic CVD process, a<br>
silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.1 was deposited thereon,<br>
post-treated using hydrogen gas, and a similar measurement was carried<br>
out.<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
Process steps up to the formation of the back electrode were carried<br>
out similarly to as described in Experiment 4, a silicon nitride film having a<br>
refractive index of 2.1 was deposited on the light-receiving surface side by<br>
the direct plasma CVD process (frequency 100 kHz), and a similar<br>
measurement was carried out.<br>
(Comparative Example 4)<br>
Process steps up to the formation of the back electrode were carried<br>
out similarly to as described in Experiment 4, a silicon nitride film having a<br>
refractive index of 2.1 was deposited on the light-receiving surface side by<br><br>
the remote plasma CVD process (microwave 2.5 GHz), and a similar<br>
measurement was carried out.<br>
Results are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
From the results, all samples of Examples 4 to 6, having the silicon<br>
nitride films thereof formed by the catalytic CVD process, are found to be<br>
superior to results of the samples of Comparative Examples 3 and 4 making<br>
use of the plasma CVD process, in every aspect of the solar cell<br>
characteristics including conversion efficiency. It is also understood that,<br>
as shown by Experiments 5 and 6, the differences are more distinctive by<br>
carrying out the surface treatment of the substrate before the film formation<br>
and the post-treatment using the same catalyst.<br>
(Experiment 7)<br>
A quasi-square (100) single crystal silicon substrate (FZ process,<br>
B-doped) having a resistivity of 0.5 Ωcm, a thickness of 300 µm and a planar<br>
size of 100 mm x100 mm was etched in a concentrated aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution to remove damages, and on the entire surface of which a<br>
texture was formed in a mixed solution of aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution/isopropanol. Two substrates were held back to back, and<br>
phosphorus was diffused at 830°C using phosphorus oxychloride as a source<br>
so as to adjust sheet resistance of the surface to 100 Ω/□. A phosphorus<br>
glass formed on the surface was then removed using a 2% hydrofluoric acid,<br><br>
and light-receiving-surface side electrodes (Ti/Pd/Ag) were formed by<br>
vacuum evaporation through a mask. The back surface was surface-treated<br>
using ammonia gas by the catalytic CVD process, a silicon nitride film having<br>
a refractive index of 2.0 (Si/N atomic ratio=0.91: without hydrogen dilution)<br>
and a thickness of 80 nm was deposited thereon by the catalytic CVD<br>
process, and then subjected to machining to form trenches, and the back<br>
electrode (Al) was vacuum-deposited thereon. Thereafter, a silicon nitride<br>
film having a refractive index of 2.1 (Si/N atomic ratio=1.04: without<br>
hydrogen dilution) and a thickness of 80 nm was deposited on the<br>
light-receiving-surface side by the catalytic CVD process. Characteristics<br>
of thus-obtained solar cell were measured using a solar simulator (1.5 sun).<br>
(Experiment 8)<br>
The solar cell was fabricated, and the characteristics thereof were<br>
evaluated by the measurement using a solar simulator (1.5 sun), similarly to<br>
as described in Example 7, except that the back surface was surface-treated<br>
using ammonia gas by the catalytic CVD process, a silicon nitride film having<br>
a refractive index of 2.0 and a thickness of 80 nm was deposited thereon,<br>
and the post-treatment was carried out using hydrogen gas.<br>
(Comparative Example 5)<br>
Process steps up to the formation of the surface electrodes were<br>
carried out similarly to as described in Experiment 7, and a solar cell was<br>
fabricated and measured by the similar process steps except that a silicon<br>
nitride film having a refractive index of 2.0 was deposited on the back<br>
surface, and a silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.1 was<br>
deposited on the light-receiving surface side by the direct plasma CVD<br>
process (frequency 100 kHz).<br>
(Comparative Example 6)<br><br>
Process steps up to the formation of the surface electrodes were<br>
carried out similarly to as described in Experiment 7, and a solar cell was<br>
fabricated and measured by the similar process steps except that a silicon<br>
nitride film having a refractive index of 2.0 was deposited on the back<br>
surface, and a silicon nitride film having a refractive index of 2.1 was<br>
deposited on the light-receiving surface side by the remote plasma CVD<br>
process (microwave 2.5 GHz).<br>
Results are shown in Table 3.<br><br>
From the results, both samples of Examples 7 and 8, having the<br>
silicon nitride films thereof formed by the catalytic CVD process, are found to<br>
be superior to results of the samples of Comparative Examples 5 and 6<br>
making use of the plasma CVD process, in every aspect of the solar cell<br>
characteristics including conversion efficiency. It is also understood that,<br>
as shown by Experiments 5 and 6, the differences are more distinctive by<br>
carrying out the surface treatment of the substrate before the film formation<br>
and the post-treatment using the same catalyst. It is also found that, for the<br>
case where the silicon nitride film is formed on the back surface, the results<br>
of Experiments 7 and 8 making use of the catalytic CVD process are<br>
desirable similarly to the results shown in Table 2, but Comparative<br>
Examples 5 and 6 making use of the plasma CVD cause degradation in the<br>
characteristics by forming the silicon nitride films on the back surface side.<br>
This is supposedly because the silicon nitride films in Comparative Examples<br>
exhibited the field passivation effect, and thereby the inversion layer on the<br><br>
substrate side grew larger, and the short-circuiting shown in FIG. 5 became<br>
more likely to occur.<br><br>

which a heat catalyst is placed together with the semiconductor solar cell substrate in a reaction vessel;<br>
and a film-forming gas, which comprises a silicon source gas and an anion source gas producing an<br><br>
anionic component capable of binding with silicon in an inorganic material to be obtained, is supplied<br>
to the surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate while making the film-forming gas into contact<br>
with the heat catalyst, so as to deposit an inorganic insulating material produced based on chemical<br>
reactions of the film-forming gas on the surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate; and is then<br>
post-treated by introducing a post-treatment gas into the reaction vessel, and by supplying the post-<br>
treatment gas to the surface of the inorganic insulating film, while keeping the post-treatment gas in<br>
contact with the heat catalyst.<br>
22. The method of fabricating a solar cell as claimed in claim 20 or 21, wherein the semiconductor<br>
solar cell substrate is a silicon substrate, the inorganic insulating film is a silicon nitride film, and the<br>
post-treatment gas is ammonia gas, hydrogen gas, or a mixed gas of both of them.<br><br>
There is disclosed a solar cell (100) comprising a semiconductor solar cell<br>
substrate (66) having a light receiving surface formed on the first major surface and<br>
generating photovoltaic power based on the light impinging on the light receiving<br>
surface, wherein the light receiving surface of the semiconductor solar cell substrate<br>
(66) is coated with a light receiving surface side insulating film (61) composed of an<br>
inorganic insulating material where the cationic component principally comprising<br>
silicon, and the light receiving surface side insulating film (61) is a low hydrogen<br>
content inorganic insulating film containing less than 10 atm% of hydrogen. A solar<br>
cell having an insulating film exhibiting excellent passivation effect insusceptible to<br>
aging can thereby be provided. A method of fabricating the solar cell is also disclosed.</td>
