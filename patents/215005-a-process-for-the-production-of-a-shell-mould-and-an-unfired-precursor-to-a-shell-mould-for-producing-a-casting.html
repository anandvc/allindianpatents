				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A SHELL MOULD<br>
AND AN UNFIRED PRECURSOR TO A SHELL MOULD FOR<br>
PRODUCING A CASTING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of<br>
a shell mould and an unfired precursor to a shell mould for<br>
producing a casting, and in particular, to a process which is<br>
much more rapid than conventional processes.<br>
 A typical investment casting process involves the production of<br>
engineering metal castings using an expendable pattern. The pattern is a<br>
complex blend of resin, filler and wax which is injected into a metal d ie<br>
under pressure. Several such patterns, once solidified are assembled into<br>
a cluster and mounted onto a wax runner system. The wax assembly i s<br>
dipped into a refractory slurry consisting of a liquid binder and a refractory<br>
powder. After draining, grains of refractory stucco are deposited onto the<br>
damp surface to produce the primary refractory coating (the covering of<br>
the assembly with refractory material is known as "investing", hence the<br>
name for the process). When the primary coat has set (usually by air<br>
drying until the binder gels) the assembly is repeatedly dipped into a<br>
slurry and then stuccoed until the required thickness of mould shell is<br>
built up. Each coat is thoroughly hardened between dippings, and so<br>
each mould can take from between 24 and 72 hours to prepare. The<br>
purpose of the stucco is to minimise drying stresses in the coatings by<br>
presenting a number of distributed stress concentration centres which<br>
reduce the magnitude of any local stresses. Each stucco surface also<br>
provides a rough surface for keying in the next coating. The particle size<br>
of the stucco is increased as more coats are added to maintain maximum<br>
mould permeability and to provide bulk to the mould.<br>
In recent years, advanced ceramics (eg. silicon nitride) components have<br>
been developed which offer significant advantages over comparable metal<br>
components. Many processes by which such ceramic components can be<br>
made are known, and these include machining, injection moulding, slip<br>
casting, pressure casting and gelcasting. In gelcasting, a concentrated<br>
slurry of ceramic powder in a solution of organic monomer is poured into<br>
a mould and polymerised in situ to form a green body in the shape of the<br>
mould cavity. After demoulding, the green ceramic body is dried,<br>
machined if necessary, pyrolysed to remove binder and then sintered to<br>
full density. Aqueous based systems, such as the acrylamide system, have<br>
been developed in which water-soluble monomers are used, with water as<br>
the solvent.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an im proved invention<br>
casting process which obviates or mitigates one or more problems<br>
associated with known investment casting processes and which preferably<br>
significantly reduces the time required for forming a shell mould.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the<br>
production of a shell mould, comprising the sequential steps of:-<br>
(i) dipping a preformed expendable pattern into a slurry of refractory<br>
particles and colloidal liquid binder whereby to form a coating layer on<br>
said pattern,<br>
(ii) depositing particles of refractory material onto said coating, and<br>
(iii) drying,<br>
steps (i) to (iii) being repeated as often as required to produce a shell<br>
mould having the required number of coating layers, characterised in that<br>
during at least one performance of step (ii) particles of a gel-forming<br>
material are also deposited onto the coating layer formed in step (i) such<br>
that after contact with the coating layer moisture is absorbed by the gel-<br>
forming material thereby causing gellation of the colloidal binder so<br>
reducing the time required for drying in step (iii).<br>
Preferably, the method also includes the additional step (iv), carried out<br>
after the final step (iii) of applying a seal coat comprising a slurry of<br>
refractory particles and colloidal liquid binder, followed by drying.<br>
In shell mould formation, the coating layer applied to the expendable<br>
pattern is usually referred to as the primary coating and subsequent slurry<br>
coatings are referred to as secondary coatings. Typically, three to twelve<br>
secondary coatings are applied.<br>
Preferably, the gel-forming material is applied onto each secondary<br>
coati ng (i.e. during each repetition of step (ii) after the first). More<br>
preferably, the gel-forming material is applied onto the primary coating.<br>
It will be understood that the deposition of refractory particles and gelforming<br>
material in step (ii) may be achieved by any convenient method,<br>
such as by use of a rainfall sander or a fluidised bed. The refractory<br>
particles and gel-forming material may be applied independently and/or<br>
sequentially or preferably they may be premixed. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment the refractory particles are pre-coated with the gelforming<br>
material.<br>
Preferably, the amount of gel-forming material used in step (ii) is no more<br>
than 10% by weight, more preferably no more than 5%, even more<br>
preferably no more than 3% and most preferably no more than 2wt% of<br>
the refractory material particles used in that step (ii).<br>
Preferably, said gel-forming material is a polymer, more preferably a super<br>
absorbent polymer exemplified by polyacrylamide and polyacrylate.<br>
In general, at least 50wt% (and even more preferably at least 80wt%) of<br>
the gel-forming material particles (in those embodiments in which the gelforming<br>
material does not coat the refractory material particles) are<br>
preferably no larger than 1 mm, more preferably no larger than 300 µm<br>
and most preferably no larger than 200 µm. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, substantially all (i.e. at least 95wt%) of the polymer particles<br>
are no more than 300 µm in size. Although there is no theoretical<br>
minimum particle size for the gel-forming material, fine powders can be<br>
problematic, particularly when applied by a rainfall sander. Thus, a<br>
preferred minimum particle size is 50 µm and more preferably 75 µm.<br>
The particles may all be substantially the same size, or there may be a<br>
particle size distribution below the maximum size.<br>
Advantageously, the process (apart from the use of the moisture absorbing<br>
material and the reduced drying times which result) can be substantially<br>
the same as a standard investment casting process using conventional<br>
machinery and materials. Thus, it will be understood that the nature of<br>
the expendable pattern, the slurry compositions used in step (i) (and step<br>
(iv) when present) and the refractory particles used in step (ii) may be any<br>
of those known to the person skilled in the art of investment casting.<br>
Moreover, the method preferably includes a step of removing the<br>
expendable pattern from the shell mould after the last step (iii) (or step (iv)<br>
when present) and more preferably the method includes a final step of<br>
firing the resultant shell mould.<br>
Firing may be effected by heating to 950°C or more. Preferably however,<br>
a multi-step firing procedure is adopted. For example, a first step may<br>
involve heating to a temperature of from 400 to 700°C at a heating rate of<br>
from 1 to 5°C/min (preferably 1 to 3°C/min). followed by a second step of<br>
heating to at least 950°C (preferably about 1000°C) at a rate of from 5 to<br>
10°C/min. The temperature may be maintained between the first and<br>
second steps for a short period (eg. less than 10 minutes). Heating to at<br>
least 950°C may be effected in three or more steps.<br>
The present invention further resides in a shell mould producible by the<br>
method of the present invention.<br>
The present invention will be further described with reference to the<br>
following examples.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
The comparative example was intended to be representative of a standard<br>
shell used for aluminium alloy casting and was constructed as follows:-<br>
A filled-wax test piece was dipped into a first slurry (primary) for 30<br>
seconds and drained for 60 seconds. Coarse-grained stucco material was<br>
then deposited onto the wet slurry surface by the rain fall sand method<br>
(deposition height about 2m). The coated test piece was placed on a<br>
drying carousel and dried for the required time under controlled<br>
conditions of low air movement. Extended drying removes moisture from<br>
the colloidal binder, forcing gellation of the particles to form a rigid gel.<br>
Subsequent coats were applied by clipping (30 seconds) in a second<br>
(secondary) slurry followed by draining (60 seconds), with subsequent<br>
stucco application (rainfall sand method, deposition height about 2m) and<br>
drying for the required time after each stucco application. In total, four<br>
secondary coatings were applied. Finally, a seal coat was applied (dip in<br>
secondary slurry, but no stucco application), followed by drying.<br>
The primary and secondary slurry specifications are contained in Table 1,<br>
with the other various process parameters being given in Table 2. The<br>
latex addition in Table 1 relates to the use of a water-based latex system,<br>
which is added to the base binder to improve unfired strength.<br>
Table 1: Slurry specifications for aluminium shell preparation<br>
(all figures are wt %)<br>
Example 1<br>
The shell mould according to Example 1 was made in the same manner as<br>
for comparative example 1 using the slurries of Table 1, except that the<br>
stucco applied onto the secondary coatings included particles of<br>
polyacrylamide (at a loading of 1 part polyacrylamide to 10 parts stucco.<br>
The process parameters are given in Table 3. When the polyacrylamide is<br>
deposited onto the wet slurry surface, it rapidly absorbs moisture from the<br>
. adjacent colloidal portion of the slurry forcing gellation to a rigid gel<br>
without the necessity of extended drying times.<br>
It is anticipated that drying times can be reduced even further by the<br>
inclusion of polyacrylamide polymer in the stucco applied to the primary<br>
slurry coating.<br>
The shell mould of Example 1 is less dense and uniform in comparison<br>
with comparative example 1. The shell of Example 1 is more open and<br>
delaminated in places due to swelling of the individual polymer particles<br>
during absorbance of moisture from the colloidal binder. The large<br>
particle size is disadvantageous in this respect and it is anticipated that<br>
these defects will be much reduced by the use of a smaller and much<br>
more controlled particle size polyacrylamide addition to the standard<br>
stucco sizes.<br>
Shell Thickness Comparisons<br>
Comparisons of the ceramic shell thickness achieved for acrylamide<br>
modified (Example 1) and standard (comparative example 1) shelf systems<br>
can be seen in Table 4. The polyacrylamide increases the shell thickness<br>
because the particle size is much larger than the stucco itself. The large<br>
size is also represented by the relatively large standard deviation in the<br>
data.<br>
Room Temperature Flat Bar Strength Measurement<br>
Strength measurements were carried out in accordance with BS 1902.<br>
Injected wax bars were used as the formers for the ceramic shells formed<br>
by the procedures indicated above. After formation, the shells were steam<br>
Boiler clave (TM) de-waxed at 8 bar pressure for 4 minutes, followed by a<br>
controlled de-pressurisation cycle at 1 bar/minute. Test pieces,<br>
approximately 20mm x 80mm were cut using a grinding wheel and tested<br>
in a 3 point bend mode at room temperature (primary coat in<br>
compression).<br>
A comparison of the maximum strengths achieved at room temperature in<br>
the 3-point bend mode for the shell samples is shown in Table 5. The<br>
high dry, green strength of the comparative example 1 shell is a direct<br>
result of the latex polymer content, which is reflected by the reduction in<br>
strength as the sample is fired at 1000°C and the latex burns out (data not<br>
shown). The strength of the Example 1 shell is relatively low, which is a<br>
direct result of the delamination and defects introduced by the use of a<br>
very large particle size polyacrylamide. It is anticipated that by the use of<br>
a smaller polymer particle size, the swelling of the acrylamide polymer<br>
shouId be reduced to a level which would be more acceptable for<br>
investment casting.<br>
Example 2<br>
In order to address the above-mentioned problems, a further example was<br>
prepared, the key differences with Example 1 being:-<br>
(i) a smaller particle size of more absorbent polymer was employed,<br>
(ii) a smaller amount of polymer was used, and<br>
(ii) polymer was incorporated into the primary stucco coating.<br>
The shell build specifications are given in Table 6 below. The slurries<br>
were as shown in Table 1.<br>
The green dry strength for Example 2 was measured as 2.83 +/-0.63 MPa.<br>
This was obtained using a different rain sand system than for Example 1,<br>
the sand being deposited from a lower height (approximately TO cm)<br>
which is known to reduce strength values. For comparison, comparative<br>
example 1 was repeated (referred to hereinafter as comparative example<br>
2) and found to have a green dry strength of 4.86+/-0.54 MPa. Thus, it<br>
has been found that in less than 2% of the time required to produce a<br>
standard shell mould, the method of the present invention allows the<br>
production of a mould having nearly 60% of the strength, which is, as will<br>
be shown below, sufficient for casting.<br>
In addition to the green dry strength measurements, Example 2 and<br>
comparative example 2 were tested for their green wet strength (to<br>
simulate strength during de-waxing) and their fired strength under different<br>
heating regimes. The results are shown in Table 7 below.<br>
Firing method B: to 700°C @ 1C/min, dwell 6 min, to 1000°C @5C/min,<br>
dwell 30 min, furnace cool<br>
Firing method C: to 700°C @ 2C/min, dwell 6 min, to 1000°C @10C/min,<br>
dwell 60 min, furnace cool.<br>
The Example 2 moulds did not crack during de-waxing. Thus, it has been<br>
shown that the method of the present invention allows the production of<br>
shell moulds, which are sufficiently strong for investment casting, in a<br>
fraction of the time required using standard methods.<br>
