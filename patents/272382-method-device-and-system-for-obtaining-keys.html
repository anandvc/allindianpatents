				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to network communication technologies, and in<br>
particular, to a solution to obtaining keys in the case that the authenticator is relocated.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
With the rapid development of the Internet and the wide application of wireless networks,<br>
higher requirements are imposed on the wireless systems for protecting the security of mobile<br>
users. In addition to the device authentication, user authentication, and service authentication,<br>
a security channel needs to be set up between the Access Points (APs) or Base Stations (BSs)<br>
to exchange the confidential information, and a confidentiality channel needs to be set up<br>
between the BS and the authenticator, between the authenticator and the authentication server<br>
to exchange confidential information.<br>
In the wireless networks, the mobile user needs to initiate authentication to the authenticators<br>
such as Network Access Server (NAS). After the authentication succeeds, the Foreign Agent<br>
(FA) of the mobile user communicates with the NAS to obtain the key information which is<br>
applicable in the subsequent communication process.<br>
After the re-authentication of the Mobile Station (MS) is initiated, the FA obtains the key. As<br>
shown in FIG. 1, the authentication process includes the following steps:<br>
Step 1: The MS accesses the network through NAS 1 and is authenticated successfully.<br>
Specifically, NAS 1 initiates an authentication process to the Authorization Authentication<br>
Accounting (AAA) server, completes the authentication operation, and determines that the<br>
MS is authenticated successfully.<br>
Step 2: The FA sends a request to NAS 1 to request the Mobile Node (MN)-FA key or the<br>
FA-Home Agent (HA) key when necessary.<br>
Step 3: The MS is re-authenticated through NAS 1.<br>
Like the authentication process, the re-authentication may be initiated by NAS 1 to the AAA<br>
server.<br>
Step 4: The MS sends an MIP-RRQ (MIP registration) message to the FA. The message<br>
carries an authentication extension calculated according to the new key. The Security<br>
Parameter Index (SPI) is also calculated according to the FA-Root Key (RK) generated after<br>
re-authentication, or is generated by other means.<br>
Step 5: After receiving the registration message, the FA compares the SPI in the MIP-RRQ<br>
message. Once determining change of the SPI, namely, occurrence of re-authentication, the<br>
FA requests the key update information of NAS 1.<br>
 <br>
Because re-authentication has occurred in step 3, the key information on NAS 1 and the MS<br>
has been updated, but the FA is unaware of the key information updated after the<br>
re-authentication. Therefore, the FA needs to request the updated key information from NAS<br>
1.<br>
Step 6: After obtaining the key, the FA can go on to handle the MIP-RRQ message and<br>
complete the subsequent process.<br>
In the foregoing process, no matter whether re-authentication occurs, as long as the FA is<br>
relocated, step 5 needs to be performed after the FA receives the MIP-RRQ message in order<br>
to request the key from NAS 1 and obtain the current key for performing the subsequent<br>
process.<br>
In the process of developing the present invention, the inventor finds at least the following<br>
defects in the prior art:<br>
In the foregoing process, if the NAS is relocated in the process of re-authenticating<br>
the MS, the FA is unable to obtain key information from the relocated NAS. Consequently,<br>
after the NAS is relocated, the FA is unable to process the received MIP-RRQ message.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The embodiments of the present invention provide a method, a device, and a system for<br>
obtaining keys so that the network device that requires the key information can still obtain the<br>
key information even if the authenticator is relocated, and the subsequent communication<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Through the embodiments of the present invention, a network device that requires key<br>
information can obtain the key information after the authenticator of the terminal is relocated.<br>
That is, the network device that requires key information determines that the authenticator<br>
corresponding to the terminal is relocated after receiving an indication about occurrence of<br>
authenticator relocation, sends a key request to the relocated authenticator, receives the key<br>
information returned by the authenticator, and obtains the key information corresponding to<br>
the terminal.<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, the network device that requires key<br>
information may be but is not limited to: an FA, a BS, and a gateway (GW). The key<br>
information includes at least one of, but is not limited to: a key, an SPI, and a lifecycle.<br>
 <br>
In the process of implementing the present invention, the indication about occurrence of<br>
authenticator relocation may be sent by the relocated authenticator, the old authenticator (the<br>
authenticator before relocation), the terminal, a Home Agent (HA), or the AAA server to the<br>
network device that requires the key information. Optionally, the relocated authenticator, the<br>
old authenticator, the terminal, the HA, or the AAA server may send an address of the<br>
relocated authenticator to the network device that requires the key information. If the address<br>
is sent by the old authenticator, the authenticator needs to maintain the corresponding relation<br>
between the terminal and the address of the relocated authenticator, and optionally, set a<br>
lifecycle for the corresponding relation. In this way, the maintained corresponding relation<br>
information can be deleted after expiry of a preset period to release the occupied storage<br>
resources and management resources.<br>
In the foregoing process, if the indication is sent by the terminal to the network device that<br>
requires the key information, the terminal needs to determine occurrence of authenticator<br>
relocation beforehand. The terminal may determine occurrence of authenticator relocation in<br>
this way: First, in the authentication process, the authenticator sends its identification<br>
information to the terminal; the terminal compares the currently received authenticator<br>
identification information with the previously received authenticator identification<br>
information, and checks whether the authenticator is relocated according to the comparison<br>
result. For example, the identification information may include: address of the authenticator,<br>
and/or number of hops from the authenticator to the gateway.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, after generating the key information<br>
corresponding to the terminal, the relocated authenticator may send the key information to the<br>
network device that requires the key information. Optionally, the relocated authenticator<br>
sends the generated key information corresponding to the terminal to the old authenticator,<br>
and the old authenticator sends the key information to the network device.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, if the network device that requires key<br>
information obtains the key information through the foregoing process, then optionally, the<br>
network device that requires the key information may judge whether the key information is<br>
received from the relocated authenticator after determining that the authenticator<br>
corresponding to the terminal is relocated. If no such key information is received, the network<br>
device may obtain the key information by sending a key request to the' relocated<br>
authenticator.<br>
In the process of implementing the present invention, the network device that requires key<br>
information may obtain the address of the relocated authenticator before sending a key<br>
 <br>
request to the relocated authenticator. In this way, the network device that requires key<br>
information can obtain the address of the relocated authenticator, and send the key request to<br>
the relocated authenticator. Specifically, the address of the relocated authenticator may be<br>
obtained in two modes:<br>
requesting to obtain the address of the relocated authenticator from the old<br>
authenticator (namely, the authenticator before relocation); or<br>
receiving the address of the relocated authenticator proactively sent by the relocated<br>
authenticator or the old authenticator.<br>
In the process of relocating the authenticator, if a network device (such as FA, BS, and GW)<br>
that requires key information is also relocated, the relocated authenticator may send the key<br>
information to the old network device (namely, the network device before relocation) that<br>
requires key information first, and the old network device sends the key information to the<br>
relocated network device that requires key information; or, the old network device that<br>
requires key information sends an indication about relocation of the network device or an<br>
address of the relocated network device to the relocated authenticator; or the relocated<br>
network device that requires key information sends an indication about relocation of the<br>
network device or an address of the relocated network device to the relocated authenticator.<br>
In this way, the relocated authenticator can send the key information to the relocated network<br>
device that requires the key information.<br>
Supposing that the network device that requires key information is an FA, the process of<br>
obtaining the key information in different scenarios is described below:<br>
(1)	The FA is relocated before the NAS is relocated, and the new FA (relocated FA)<br>
obtains the address of the old authenticator (the authenticator before relocation).<br>
In this case, the new FA serves as the current FA of the terminal, and the network<br>
device that requires key information can obtain the key information through the foregoing<br>
process.<br>
(2)	The NAS is relocated before the FA is relocated, and the old FA (the FA before<br>
relocation) obtains the address of the new NAS (relocated NAS).<br>
In this case, the new FA can obtain the address of the new NAS in the relocation<br>
process, and the network device that requires key information can obtain the key information<br>
easily. For example, the relocated FA sends an indication about relocation of the FA or an<br>
address of the relocated FA to the new NAS, or the old FA sends an indication about<br>
relocation of the FA or an address of the new FA to the new NAS. Afterward, the new NAS<br>
sends the key information to the relocated FA so that the new NAS can send the key<br>
 <br>
information to the new FA.<br>
(3) In the process of relocating the FA, the old NAS is being relocated.<br>
In this case, the new FA needs to request a key from the old NAS. In the process of<br>
the old NAS sending the key information to the new FA, the following operations may be<br>
performed:<br>
If the old NAS notifies the address of the new NAS to the new FA when notifying the new FA<br>
that the NAS is being relocated, the new FA sends a key request to the new NAS. If the NAS<br>
has finished re-authentication, the new NAS returns new key information; otherwise, the new<br>
NAS returns an instruction that lets the new FA wait, or sends the new key information to the<br>
new FA after completion of re-authentication; and<br>
If the old NAS notifies the new FA that the NAS is being relocated without notifying the<br>
address of the new NAS, the new FA may request the address of the new NAS from the old<br>
NAS (namely, the relocated authenticator may send the key information to the old FA first,<br>
and then the old FA sends the key information to the relocated FA), or wait for the new NAS<br>
to update the key proactively.<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, before determining that the authenticator<br>
corresponding to the terminal is relocated, the network device that requires key information<br>
needs to determine whether the terminal is re-authenticated. If the terminal is re-authenticated,<br>
the network device that requires key information can further determine whether the<br>
authenticator corresponding to the terminal is relocated. If the authenticator is relocated, the<br>
network device can obtain the key information according to the embodiments of the present<br>
invention. The network device that requires key information determines whether the terminal<br>
is re-authenticated in this way: The network device that requires key information stores the<br>
SPI between the terminal and the HA. If the received SPI in the registration request sent by<br>
the terminal or other devices is different from the stored SPI between the terminal and the HA,<br>
the terminal is re-authenticated; otherwise, the terminal is not re-authenticated; or, the<br>
network device that requires key information may determine whether the terminal is<br>
re-authenticated according to the explicit or implicit re-authentication indication in the<br>
received message.<br>
If the network device that requires key information is an FA, the key information to be<br>
obtained by the FA may be Mobile IP (MIP) key information. This embodiment enables<br>
obtaining of the MIP key after the NAS is relocated in the process of the FA updating the MIP<br>
key, minimizes contending scenarios, shortens the time spent in obtaining the key, and helps<br>
the FA obtain a valid MIP key. The MIP key may be a Mobile Node (MN)-FA key or FA-HA<br>
 <br>
key. However, the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the exemplary<br>
application.<br>
In the process of re-authenticating the terminal, the authenticator may be relocated, or the<br>
re-authentication is performed on the old authenticator directly. When being relocated, the<br>
authenticator needs to notify the address of the new authenticator to the FA so that the FA can<br>
request the key information subsequently. The FA relocation is independent of the<br>
authenticator relocation, and may be synchronous or asynchronous with the authenticator<br>
relocation.<br>
Supposing a scenario that the NAS (serving as an authenticator) is relocated and the key<br>
information to be obtained by the FA includes an MN-FA key, the process of implementing<br>
the embodiment of the present invention is described below. In this scenario, as shown in FIG.<br>
2, FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the process includes the following steps:<br>
Step 1: The MS accesses the network through NAS 1 and is authenticated successfully.<br>
Step 2: When requiring an MN-FA key, the FA sends a request (specifically, a context request)<br>
to NAS 1, requesting the corresponding key.<br>
Step 3: The re-authentication for the MS is performed through NAS 2. That is, the NAS is<br>
relocated.<br>
In the re-authentication process, the key information on NAS 2 and the MS is updated, but<br>
the FA is unaware of the re-authentication event and the updated key information.<br>
Step 4: After the re-authentication, the MS or the HA (only the MS is illustrated in the figure<br>
here) sends an MIP-RRQ message to the FA. The message carries an authentication extension<br>
calculated according to the new key. The SPI in the message is calculated according to the<br>
FA-RK generated after the re-authentication, or may be an indication about occurrence of<br>
re-authentication.<br>
Step 5: After receiving the message, the FA compares the SPI carried in the MIP-RRQ<br>
message with the locally maintained SPI. If the two SPIs are different (which indicates that<br>
re-authentication has occurred), or if the occurrence of re-authentication is confirmed by an<br>
indication, the FA obtains the updated key information. Specifically, the FA may send a<br>
context request to NAS 2 to obtain the corresponding key.<br>
In this step, if the FA is relocated, the new FA is in the same state after the FA obtains the<br>
address of the old NAS. That is, the new FA knows the address of the old NAS and needs to<br>
obtain the MIP key information.<br>
In this step, the process of requesting the updated key from the NAS comes in three scenarios<br>
but is not limited to the three scenarios. As shown in FIG. 2, FIG. 3, and FIG. 4 respectively,<br>
 <br>
the process is as follows.<br>
(1)	As shown in FIG. 2, if the notification message from NAS 2 to the FA has not<br>
arrived at the FA in the process of relocating NAS 2, the FA requests the key update<br>
information from NAS 1. NAS 1 returns a NAS relocation indication and/or the address of<br>
the new NAS (namely, NAS 2) to the FA, and then the FA sends a key request to NAS 2 to<br>
obtain the corresponding MIP key information.<br>
(2)	As shown in FIG. 3, if the notification message from NAS 2 to the FA has not<br>
arrived at the FA in the process of relocating NAS 2, the FA requests the key update<br>
information from NAS 1. NAS 1 returns a NAS relocation indication and/or the address of<br>
the new NAS (namely, NAS 2) to the FA. Before the FA sends a key request to NAS 2, the<br>
notification message about NAS 2 relocation arrives at the FA. If the message carries the<br>
updated key and context information, the FA gives up sending the key request; otherwise, the<br>
FA sends a key request to NAS 2.<br>
(3)	As shown in FIG. 4, if the notification message from NAS 2 to the FA arrives at<br>
the FA in the process of relocating NAS 2, and if the message carries the updated key and<br>
context information, the FA gives up sending a key request to NAS 2; otherwise, the FA<br>
sends a key request to NAS 2 to obtain the corresponding MIP key information.<br>
If the FA is also relocated and the update message of NAS 2 is sent to the old FA, the old FA<br>
needs to forward the update message to the new FA, and therefore, the new FA can still obtain<br>
the corresponding MIP key information conveniently; or the old FA returns an indication<br>
about FA relocation or the address of the new FA to NAS 2 and then NAS 2 sends the key<br>
information to the new FA.<br>
Through steps 1-5, the FA obtains the updated key information and then goes on to process<br>
the MIP-RRQ message.<br>
In the foregoing scenario, in the case that the MIP-RRQ message carries only information<br>
about occurrence of re-authentication, another solution is provided in an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this solution, the MIP-RRQ message may carry an indication about<br>
relocation of the NAS. As shown in FIG. 5, the process may include the following steps:<br>
Step 1: The first authentication is performed. In the EAP process, NAS 1 sends its own<br>
address or the number of hops from the NAS to the serving GW to the MS and keeps a<br>
record.<br>
Step 2: A re-authentication is performed. The MS obtains the address of NAS 1 or the number<br>
of hops from the NAS to the serving GW, and compares the received information with the<br>
previously recorded address or the number of hops (namely, the information recorded in step<br>
 <br>
1). If the information matches, the MS determines that the NAS is not relocated.<br>
Step 3: The MIP-RRQ sent by the MS carries an indication, indicating that re-authentication<br>
has occurred but the NAS is not relocated. The indication may be: a different algorithm of the<br>
SPI, or a separate extension header.<br>
For example, if the SPI is an odd number, the NAS is relocated; if the SPI is an even number,<br>
the NAS is not relocated. If the indication is an extension header, the extension header may<br>
include a type indicative of the relocation state of the NAS or include the address of the<br>
current NAS.<br>
Step 4: A re-authentication is performed. The MS obtains the address of NAS 2 or the number<br>
of hops from the NAS to the serving GW, and compares the received information with the<br>
previously recorded address or number of hops (namely, the information recorded in step 1).<br>
If the information does not match, the MS determines that the NAS is relocated.<br>
Step 5: The MIP-RRQ sent by the MS carries an indication, indicating that the MS is<br>
re-authenticated and the NAS is relocated at the same time.<br>
Based on the foregoing process, the operations performed by the FA after the FA receives the<br>
corresponding MIP-RRQ message may be:<br>
(1)	After the FA receives the MIP-RRQ message, if the message carries no NAS<br>
address information, the FA performs operations according to the indication information in<br>
the MIP-RRQ message: If no re-authentication occurs, the FA goes on with the process; if<br>
re-authentication has occurred but the NAS is not relocated, the FA requests a key from the<br>
old NAS; if re-authentication has occurred and the NAS is relocated at the same time, the FA<br>
waits for the new NAS to send a notification proactively; if the notification sent by the new<br>
NAS carries no key information required by the FA, the FA needs to request the key<br>
information from the new NAS, or request the new NAS information or updated key<br>
information from the old NAS; and<br>
(2)	after the FA receiving the MIP-RRQ message, if the MIP-RRQ message carries<br>
the NAS address information, the FA may request the key information from the indicated<br>
NAS.<br>
In order to further clarify the process of the FA obtaining the MIP key (for example, MN-FA<br>
key in the MIP key), the following gives more details about the process with reference to an<br>
accompanying drawing.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the process of implementing a state machine of the FA includes the<br>
following steps:<br>
Step 1: The FA receives an MIP-RRQ message.<br>
 <br>
Step 2: The FA judges whether an MN-FA key exists locally. If such a key exists, the FA<br>
performs step 3; otherwise, the FA performs step 7.<br>
Step 3: The FA compares the SPI in the received MIP-RRQ message with the locally stored<br>
SP1. If the SPI matches, no re-authentication has occurred, and the FA performs step 15;<br>
otherwise, re-authentication has occurred, and the FA performs step 4.<br>
Step 4: The FA judges whether the NAS is relocated. If the NAS is relocated, the FA performs<br>
step 5; otherwise, the FA performs step 6. The specific judgment method may be, but is not<br>
limited to: The FA judges whether the NAS is relocated according to the NAS relocation<br>
indication such as the SPI or the Context-Rpt sent by the new NAS.<br>
In this step, if the FA is unable to determine whether the NAS is relocated, the FA performs<br>
step 7.<br>
In this step, if the FA determines that the NAS is relocated, the FA may further determine<br>
whether the key of the new NAS is received. If the key of the new NAS is received, the FA<br>
performs step 5. The key of the new NAS may be sent by the new NAS directly, or forwarded<br>
by the old NAS which receives the key of the new NAS from the new NAS.<br>
Step 5: The FA judges whether the address of the new NAS is known; if the address of the<br>
new NAS is known, the FA performs step 8; otherwise, the FA performs step 9.<br>
Step 6: The FA requests an MN-FA key from the old NAS, and performs step 15.<br>
Step 7: The FA requests the MN-FA key from the old NAS, or sets a clock and waits until the<br>
information is received from the authenticator (the authenticator that performs the<br>
re-authentication). If the FA receives the information fed back by the old NAS, the FA<br>
performs step 10; if the FA receives an indication sent by the new NAS, the FA performs step<br>
12.<br>
After receiving the information, the FA terminates the set clock. If the FA receives no<br>
information from the authenticator before expiry of the clock, the FA discards the MIP-RRQ<br>
message.<br>
Step 8: The FA requests an MN-FA key from the new NAS (namely, relocated NAS), and<br>
performs step 15.<br>
Step 9: The FA waits for the indication from the new NAS, or queries the old NAS about the<br>
address of the new NAS or the MN-FA key, and performs step 12 after receiving the<br>
indication of the new NAS or the feedback from the old NAS. The received indication of the<br>
new NAS or feedback of the old NAS may be the MN-FA key of the new NAS or the address<br>
of the new NAS.<br>
Step 10: According to the feedback information returned by the old NAS, the FA judges<br>
 <br>
whether the NAS is relocated. If the NAS is relocated, the FA performs step 12; otherwise,<br>
the FA performs step 11.<br>
In this step, the judgment method may be, but is not limited to: The FA judges whether the<br>
NAS is relocated according to the received NAS relocation indication such as SPI or<br>
Context-Rpt.<br>
Step 11: If the feedback sent by the old NAS carries no MN-FA key, the FA sends a request to<br>
the old NAS, requesting the corresponding MN-FA key. After obtaining the MN-FA key, the<br>
FA performs step 15. If the feedback from the old NAS carries the MN-FA key, the FA<br>
performs step 15 directly.<br>
Step 12: The FA judges whether the new NAS has sent the corresponding MN-FA key to the<br>
FA, namely, judges whether the FA already receives the MN-FA key. If the MN-FA key is<br>
received, the FA performs step 13; otherwise, the FA obtains the address of the new NAS<br>
from the indication received from the new NAS or the feedback received from the old NAS,<br>
and performs step 14.<br>
Step 13: The FA obtains the MN-FA key from the information sent by the new NAS, and<br>
performs step 15.<br>
Step 14: According to the address of the new NAS, the FA requests the corresponding MA-FA<br>
key from the new NAS. After obtaining the MN-FA key, the FA performs step 15.<br>
Step 15: The FA handles the received MIP-RRQ message according to the obtained key<br>
information.<br>
