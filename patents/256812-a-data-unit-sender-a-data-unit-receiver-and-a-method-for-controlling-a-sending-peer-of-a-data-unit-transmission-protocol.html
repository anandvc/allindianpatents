Field of the invention<br>
The present application relates to a method of keeping a<br>
record of a data transmission, to a method of controlling a<br>
sending peer of a data unit transmission protocol and to a<br>
corresponding sending peer, as well as to a method of<br>
controlling a receiving peer of a data unit transmission<br>
protocol and to a corresponding receiving peer.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communication<br>
via data unit transmission. In data unit communication, a<br>
stream of data symbols (e.g. bits or bytes) is divided by a<br>
sender into units, sent over an appropriate transmission<br>
network to a receiver, and the receiver reconstructs the data<br>
symbol stream on the basis of the received data units.<br>
Usually, this is performed in the context of a layering scheme<br>
(such as the OSI scheme), i.e. where a sending peer of a given<br>
protocol receives a data symbol stream from a higher layer,<br>
generates data units in accordance with the given protocol to<br>
which the sending peer adheres, and passes the generated data<br>
units to lower layers. On the receiving side, the receiving<br>
peer receives the data units from the lower layer,<br>
reconstructs the data symbol stream, and passes the<br>
reconstructed data symbol stream to the higher layer. The<br>
concept of dividing a data symbol stream into data units and<br>
the concept of layering are well known in the art, such that a<br>
further explanation is not necessary here.<br>
It is noted that such sub-divisions of data are referred to by<br>
a variety of names, such as packets, segments, frames,<br>
protocol data units, service data units, etc. In the context<br>
of the present specification and claims, the term "data unit"<br>
is used generically to relate to any such sub-divisions of<br>
data for the purpose of communication.<br><br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic representation of a sending and a<br>
receiving peer of a communication. More specifically, two<br>
peers 51 and 52 of a predetermined layer LX are shown. The<br>
layer LX can e.g. be the link layer L2. For the purpose of the<br>
present explanation it will be assumed that peer 51 is acting<br>
as sending peer and peer 52 as receiving peer. In this case<br>
sending peer 51 receives a stream of data symbols from higher<br>
layer LX+1. Sending peer 51 comprises a data unit generating<br>
part 510, e.g. a buffer, and a control part 511, e.g. a<br>
processor for controlling the data unit generating part 510.<br>
Furthermore, it is assumed that a plurality of channels 53 for<br>
lower layer LX-1 exist, and that sending peer 51 comprises a<br>
switching part 512 for selecting a channel, where control part<br>
511 controls the data unit generator 510 in such a way that<br>
data units of the correct format are generated for a given<br>
channel. In other words, each of the channels is associated<br>
with a particular data unit format. The lower layer LX-1 (and<br>
possibly layers below LX-1) provide a connection 55 to<br>
receiving peer 52, where the data units arrive over channels<br>
54 that correspond to the channels 53. Consequently receiving<br>
peer 52 has a switching part 522 for receiving data units from<br>
the appropriate channel 54, and the data units are processed<br>
in a part 520 that serves to reconstruct the data symbol<br>
stream under control of a control part 521. The reconstructed<br>
data symbol stream is passed to higher layer LX+1.<br>
For example, if LX is the link layer L2, then the various<br>
channels 53, 54 can e.g. relate to a variety of different<br>
physical communication paths, such as a variety of WCDMA<br>
(Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) connections, a HSDPA<br>
(High-Speed Down Link Packet Access) connection, a GSM (Global<br>
System for Mobile Communication) connection, a WLAN (Wireless<br>
Local Area Network) connection, or some other wireless type of<br>
connection.<br>
In order for the receiving peer 52 to be able to reconstruct<br>
the data symbol stream, each data unit carries a sequence<br>
position indicator that indicates a position in a sequence of<br><br>
data units. By correctly ordering the sequence in accordance<br>
with the sequence position indicators, the receiving peer can<br>
reconstruct the data symbol stream.<br>
In the scenario of Fig. 5, it is assumed that at least some of<br>
the channels 53, 54 require data units of a different format<br>
(e.g. of a different size; <br>
As a consequence, if the sending peer 51 is in the process of<br>
sending data units over one of the channels 53 in accordance<br>
with a format associated with said channel, then it keeps a<br>
record of the amount of sent data symbols of said data symbol<br>
streams in terms of the data units of the format being used.<br>
In other words, the sending peer keeps a record of a sequence<br>
of data units in terms of the sequence position indicators<br>
where the records shows which data units have been sent and<br>
which have not.<br>
In the situation as indicated in Fig. 5, the following can<br>
occur. It can become necessary or desirable to switch from a<br>
given channel (and given data unit format) to a new channel<br>
(and therefore possibly new data unit format) during the<br>
ongoing transmission of a data symbol stream. In order to<br>
guarantee a correct reconstruction of the data symbol stream<br>
at the receiving peer, it is envisionable to purge the sending<br>
buffer in data unit generator 510 together with all of the<br>
corresponding records kept in terms of the initial data unit<br>
format and corresponding sequence position indicators, and to<br>
restart sending with the new data units in their new format,<br>
where the corresponding new sequence position indicators are<br>
also reset, i.e. start at the initial value (zero or one).<br>
Such a procedure for purging a send buffer and resetting the<br>
corresponding records may lead to a number of disadvantages.<br>
For one thing, the purging can lead to a loss of parts of the<br>
data symbol stream. Also, if ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) is<br>
implemented between the sending peer 51 and receiving peer 52,<br>
then there the problem that after a switch in channels and in<br><br>
formats, it is difficult to appropriately retransmit lost or<br>
damaged data units.<br>
Object of the present application<br>
It is the object of the present application to provide an<br>
improved method of managing data units in a system where data<br>
units can be sent in at least a first format and a second<br>
format from a sending peer to a receiving peer.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object is solved by the methods and devices described in<br>
the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments are described<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a sending peer of a<br>
data unit transmission protocol that is capable of dividing a<br>
data symbol stream into data units of at least a first format<br>
and a second format maintains a first record of the data<br>
symbol stream in terms of one or more first sequences of data<br>
units of the first format and simultaneously maintains a<br>
second record of the data symbol stream in terms of one or<br>
more second sequences of data units of the second format. The<br>
first record and second record have a common reference point<br>
to the data symbol stream, e.g. the beginning of the<br>
respective first data unit.<br>
Due to the simultaneous record keeping it is not necessary to<br>
purge a sending buffer or reset records when switching from<br>
the first format to the second format. The sending peer is<br>
capable of dynamically switching between a first transmission<br>
mode for sending data units in the first format and a second<br>
transmission mode for sending data units in the second format,<br>
where it is not necessary to reset the sequence position<br>
indicators after the switching in transmission mode. Namely,<br>
after switching from the first transmission to the second<br>
transmission mode, the transmission continues with a given<br><br>
data unit of one of the second sequences comprising a position<br>
indicator such that the given data unit comprises a data<br>
symbol immediately following the last data symbol of the data<br>
symbol stream that was sent in the data unit of the first<br>
format last sent before the switching. Equally, after<br>
switching from the second transmission mode to the first<br>
transmission mode, the transmission continues with a given<br>
data unit of one of the first sequences comprising a position<br>
indicator such that the given data unit comprises a data<br>
symbol immediately following the last data symbol of the data<br>
symbol stream that was sent in the data unit of the second<br>
format last sent before the switching.<br>
It is noted that there can naturally be more than two formats,<br>
in which case the sending peer may keep respective records for<br>
each format.<br>
The receiving peer of the present invention is capable of<br>
identifying the respective sequence position indicator<br>
associated with the first sequence of the first format or<br>
second sequence of the second format, and is capable of<br>
detecting the switching of the sending peer between the first<br>
transmission mode and second transmission mode. The<br>
reconstructing of the data symbol stream occurs on the basis<br>
of the identified sequence position indicators and the<br>
detected switching.<br>
It is noted that the receiving peer does not necessarily have<br>
to keep a first and a second record respectively associated<br>
with the first sequence of data units of the first format and<br>
second sequence of data units of the second format, using a<br>
common reference point to the data symbol stream. Namely, it<br>
is possible that the receiving peer reconstructs the data<br>
symbol stream using dedicated instruction messages from the<br>
sending peer. In other words, the sending peer sends<br>
instruction messages to the receiving peer, where the<br>
instruction messages tell the receiving peer how to assemble<br>
the data symbol stream on the basis of the data symbols of the<br><br>
first and second format and the associated sequence position<br>
indicators of the respective formats.<br>
However, it is preferable that the receiving peer maintains a<br>
first record associated with the data units of the first<br>
format and a second record associated with the data units of<br>
the second format, and reconstructs the data symbol stream on<br>
the basis of a common reference point of the first sequence of<br>
data units of the first format and the second sequence of data<br>
units of the second format.<br>

Detailed description of embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows an example of a method of keeping a<br>
record of a data transmission in a sending peer in accordance<br>
with the present invention. Arrow 10 represents a data symbol<br>
stream. The data symbols can be present in any suitable or<br>
desirable way, e.g. can be bits, bytes, etc. The data symbol<br>
stream can already have a certain structure as provided from<br>
the higher layer, e.g. can be divided into higher layer data<br>
units. This is indicated by sequence 11 of data units a, b, c.<br>
For example, if the data units being generated belongs to the<br>
link layer L2, then the data units a, b, c of sequence 11<br>
could be protocol data units (PDUs) of layer L3.<br>
In accordance with the present embodiment of the invention, a<br>
sending peer of a data unit transmission protocol that is<br>
transmitting data symbol stream 10 maintains a first record of<br>
the data symbol stream 10 in terms of a first sequence 12 of<br>
data units A1-A11 of a first format A, and simultaneously<br>
maintains a second record of the data symbol stream 10 in<br>
terms of a second sequence 13 of data units B1-B15 of a second<br>
format B. The first and second record have a common reference<br>
point 14 to the data symbol stream 10.<br>
An example of such a method is shown in Fig. 6. Step S61<br>
represents the procedure for controlling the transmission of<br>
data units, and steps S62 and S63 represent the simultaneous<br>
maintenance of corresponding records with respect to the<br>
associated formats, regardless of which format was used in the<br><br>
actual sending. Naturally, the procedure of Fig. 6 is only an<br>
example, and other embodiments are possible, e.g. steps S62<br>
and S63 may also be conducted sequentially, as this still<br>
leads to a simultaneous record keeping with respect to the two<br>
formats. Although not shown in Fig. 6, the keeping of more<br>
than two records for corresponding more than two formats is<br>
also possible and straight-forwardly achieved.<br>
Each sequence 12, 13 has sequence position indicators for<br>
identifying the correct position in the respective sequence.<br>
In Fig. 1 these sequence position indicators are shown as<br>
simple numbering, together with an indication of the<br>
respective format. Therefore, e.g. "Al" represents the data<br>
unit of format A having the sequence position 1, "B3"<br>
represents the data unit of format B having the sequence<br>
position 3, etc.<br>
It is noted that the data units A1-A11 and B1-B15 represent<br>
the payload of actual data units. However, as shall be<br>
explained in the following with reference to Fig. 2, not every<br>
shown data unit is actually sent. Much rather, Fig. 1<br>
signifies that a record is simultaneously kept in terms of<br>
both shown formats, in order to allow a dynamic switching<br>
between sending data units of format A from sequence 12 or<br>
data units of format B from sequence 13.<br>
Fig. 1 is only a schematic representation, and the record can<br>
be kept in any suitable or desirable way. For example, the<br>
record can be provided by a mapping between data symbol<br>
positions and the respective sequence position indicators. The<br>
sequence position indicators can e.g. be simple whole numbers,<br>
as indicated in Fig. 1. However, there are also other<br>
possibilities. For example, the data symbol positions can<br>
themselves be used as sequence position indicators. Namely,<br>
the last data symbol position in a data unit can be used for<br>
identifying the data unit. For example, if one assumes that<br>
the data units of format A have a length of N data symbols,<br>
then (assuming a starting point of data symbol number 1) Al<br><br>
can be identified by data symbol number N, A2 by data symbol<br>
number 2N, etc.<br>
All records can be kept in the same fashion, or one record can<br>
be kept by means of a conversion function from another record.<br>
For example, when using natural numbers as sequence position<br>
indicators, the sequence position indicator for format A can<br>
e.g. be determined from the sequence position indicators for<br>
format B by:<br><br>
where No(A) indicates the sequence position number for format<br>
A, [ ] indicates an integer truncation, No(B) indicates the<br>
sequence position number for format B, Len(A) indicates the<br>
length of data units of format A, and Len(B) indicates the<br>
length of data units of format B.<br>
In some data transmission systems the sequence position<br>
numbering space is limited. In such cases, a so-called wrap-<br>
around may occur. For example, if the sequence position is<br>
given by 10 bits, then a wrap-around will occur every 1024<br>
positions. In general, this problem can be solved by employing<br>
an appropriate modulo operation in the addressing of a given<br>
data symbol position in terms of a specific data unit format,<br>
and equally using modulo operations when converting from<br>
sequence position indicators in one format to sequence<br>
position indicators in another format.<br>
In the following, a specific example of record keeping in such<br>
a situation will be explained. For this example, a constant<br>
data unit length is assumed. It will also take into account<br>
the possibility of a wrap-around occurring in the sequence<br>
position numbering.<br>
In Fig. 1, the reference s represents a data symbol position<br>
in stream 10. In terms of the first sequence 12 of data units<br><br>
of format A and second sequence 13 of data units of format b»<br>
the symbol position s can be represented or addressed as<br>
{SNA(s); PosA(s)} in terms of format A and as {SNB(s); PosB(s)}<br>
in terms of format B. SNA(s) represents the sequence position<br>
of the corresponding data unit in the first sequence of format<br>
A, SNB(s) represents the sequence position of the corresponding<br>
data unit in the second sequence of format B, PosA(s)<br>
represents the position of s within the data unit of format A<br>
and PosB(s) represents the position of s within the data unit<br>
of format B. In the example of Fig. i, SNA(s) would be A4,<br>
SNB(s) would be Bb, and arrow 15 represents PosA(s) and arrow<br>
16 represents PosB(s).<br>
The representation of s in a format X, i.e. {SNx(s); Posx(s)},<br>
can be determined as:<br><br>
where the reference point is assumed as shown in Fig. 1, i.e.<br>
{SNx(s=0)=0; Posx(s-0)-0}.<br>
[ ] represents an integer truncation and a mod b represents a<br>
modulo operation. MaxSN(X) is the maximum of the limited<br>
sequence position numbering space, and Len(X) is the length of<br>
a data unit (more specifically the length of the payload of a<br>
data unit) of format A.<br>
In addition, for each format X, a reference value Refx(s) can<br>
be determined, which specifies the effect the offset of the<br>
representation window start and the reference point:<br><br><br>
An arbitrary format A can then be converted into an arbitrary<br>
format B as follows:<br><br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows a sequence 20 of data units sent by<br>
the sending peer and a sequence 21 of data units received by a<br>
receiving peer.<br>
In the example of Fig. 2, the transmission starts with data<br>
units of the first format A. The sender sends data units 1A-<br>
4A. In order to distinguish the record as shown in Fig. 1 from<br>
the actual data units sent, the data units of Fig. 2 are<br>
identified by the sequence position indicator (1, 2, ...)<br>
following by the format indicator (A, B), as opposed to the<br>
reference in Fig. 1, where the sequence position indicator<br>
follows the format indicator.<br>
In the example of Fig. 2, at point 22 a mode switch occurs in<br>
the sending peer. Namely, the sending peer dynamically<br>
switches from the first transmission mode A to the second<br>
transmission mode R. There can be a variety of reasons for<br>
switching the transmission mode e.g. due to changes in the<br>
availability of channels for transporting the data units of<br>
the first format A or the second format B. In any case, the<br>
present invention is not concerned with the reasons for<br>
performing a format switch.<br>
After switching from the first transmission mode A to the<br>
second transmission B, the transmission continues with data<br>
unit 6B that corresponds to B6 of second sequence 13, because<br>
B6 contains the data symbol immediately following the last<br><br>
symbol of the data symbol stream 10 chat was sent in data unit<br>
4A before the mode switch 22.<br>
The transmission therefore continues with the data units 6B-9B<br>
of second format B, until a further mode switch 23 occurs,<br>
back to the first format A. After switching from the second<br>
transmission mode to the first transmission mode, the<br>
transmission continues with data unit 7A that corresponds to<br>
A7 of the first sequence 12, because A7 comprises the data<br>
symbol immediately following the last data symbol of the data<br>
symbol stream 10 that was sent in data unit 9B before the mode<br>
switch 23.<br>
In order to identify the correct data unit after a mode<br>
switch, the first sequence 12 and second sequence 13 share a<br>
common reference point 14 to the data symbol stream 10. In the<br>
example of Fig. 1, the common reference point is the beginning<br>
of the data symbol stream, i.e. the first data symbol, where<br>
the first data symbol of the data symbol stream is assigned as<br>
the first symbol of: the data unit carrying the first sequence<br>
position indicator in both sequences 12 and 13.<br>
The setting of a reference point in this way is the<br>
intuitively most appealing, and therefore preferred. However,<br>
the present invention is by no means restricted to such a<br>
reference point, as the reference point common to the<br>
sequences and the data symbol stream can be chosen arbitrarily<br>
and can be adapted dynamically.<br>
Also, it is noted that the term "data symbol scream" relates<br>
to any stream of data symbols, i.e. to a complete amount of<br>
data for sending or to a contiguous subset of such a complete<br>
amount. In other words, in an overall stream of data symbols,<br>
the beginning and end for defining the "data -symbol stream"<br>
can be chosen arbitrarily.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a flow chart of an example of the above described<br>
control method. In step S71 it is determined whether a mode<br><br>
switch should occur. If no, the process proceeds to step S72,<br>
where the sending of data units continues with the present<br>
format. On the other hand, if step S71 indicates a change in<br>
mode and thereby in format, then the correct sequence position<br>
indicator for the new format is determined in the above<br>
described way, and then a data unit of the new format and<br>
having the determined sequence indicator is transmitted.<br>
Returning to Fig. 2, the receiving peer receives the sequence<br>
21 of data units of both formats A and B. In order to<br>
reconstruct the data symbol stream, the receiving peer<br>
identifies the respective sequence position indicators in each<br>
received data unit and detects a switching of the sending peer<br>
from the first format A to the second format B, as at switch<br>
22, or from the second format B to the first format A, as at<br>
switch 23.<br>
An example of this is shown in Fig. 8. The shown method is<br>
conducted after receiving a data unit. In step S81 a switch in<br>
transmission mode is detected. Then, in step S82 the sequence<br>
position indicator is identified. Finally, in step S83, the<br>
reconstruction is performed in dependence on the identified<br>
sequence position indicator and on the possibly detected mode<br>
switch. Naturally this is only an example, as steps S81 and<br>
S82 could also be executed concurrently, or S82 could be<br>
executed before step S81.<br>
In order to correctly reconstruct the data symbol stream, the<br>
receiving peer is capable of determining how to assemble the<br>
data units of the first format A and the second format B at<br>
the transmission of a mode switch. This detection can be done<br>
in a number of ways. For one thing, it is possible that the<br>
sender sends dedicated messages indicating a switch in data<br>
unit format, where said messages may also indicate how to<br>
assemble the last data unit before the switch and the first<br>
data unit after the switch.<br><br>
Preferably, the receiving peer also maintains a first and a<br>
second sequence, similar to what is shown in Fig. 1, using a<br>
common reference point to the data symbol stream. The common<br>
reference point can be implicitly defined with respect to the<br>
sequence position indicators as e.g. shown in Fig. 1. Namely,<br>
it can be a common rule known to all sending peers and<br>
receiving peers that the reference point is the first data<br>
symbol contained in the respective date unit carrying the<br>
first sequence position indicator.<br>
However, it is equally possible that the sending peer sends a<br>
reference point synchronization message to the receiving peer<br>
for setting the reference point, where the receiving peer sets<br>
its common reference point on the basis of the reference point<br>
synchronization method. The synchronization message can be<br>
used for an initial setting or for a subsequent resetting of<br>
the reference point.<br>
The change in format at the point in time of a mode switch can<br>
be communicated in different ways from the sending peer to the<br>
receiving peer. For example, the different formats can be<br>
fixedly associated with given channels, as already explained<br>
in connection with Fig. 5. In other words, the format is<br>
identified by the channel over which the data unit is sent and<br>
received. As such, the changing -of one channel to another<br>
serves to identify the switch in transmission mode by the<br>
sending peer.<br>
On the other hand, it is alternatively or additionally<br>
possible for the sending peer to send a message indicating an<br>
associated switching in data unit format.<br>
As a further alternative or additional possibility, it is<br>
possible to send a format type indicator in each data unit.<br>
The receiving peer is then arranged to identify the format<br>
type indicator from each received data unit, where a change in<br>
format and correspondingly a switch in the transmission mode<br>
can straight-forwardly be recognised.<br><br>
Attention is also drawn t:o the fact that the sequence position<br>
indicator provided m the data units can be chosen in any<br>
desirable or suitable form. For example, it can be in the form<br>
indicated in Figs. 1 and 2, i.e. a consecutive whole number<br>
count. However, the sequence position indicator can also be of<br>
the type known from TCP/IP, i.e. can be an indication of the<br>
number of data symbols that has been transported. In other<br>
words, the sequence position indicator can be a count value<br>
that directly relates to the data unit or a count value that<br>
relates to the contents of the data unit.<br>
As explained above, the receiving peer is able to reconstruct<br>
the data symbol stream on the basis of the identified sequence<br>
position indicators and the detected mode switching. When<br>
reconstructing the data symbol stream, the receiving peer<br>
eliminates the duplicate data symbols that where unnecessarily<br>
sent as a cause of the mode switching. This can be explained<br>
with reference to boxes 2 4 and 2 5 in Fig. 2. Namely, when<br>
switching from format A to format B at point 22, the sending<br>
of data unit 6B leads to a renewed sending of the data symbols<br>
identified by box 2 4 as an overlap between data units A4 and<br>
B6 of Fig. 1. Equally, when switching from format B to format<br>
A, at point 23, the data symbols indicated by box 25 are sent<br>
twice, as an overlap between data unit B9 and A7 of Fig. 1.<br>
As indicated above, the receiving peer can e.g. identify the<br>
redundant data symbols on the basis of dedicated messages from<br>
the sending peer, which dedicated messages e. g. identify<br>
specifically which part of data unit 6B or 7A to eliminate<br>
(e.g. using the values Posx(s) described above) , or on the<br>
basis of the common reference point between the first sequence<br>
12 and the second sequence 13, which common reference point<br>
allows to identify the respective overlap between the two<br>
sequences 12, 13.<br>
Nonetheless, as can be seen from the above described example,<br>
the performance of a mode switch and the subsequent change in<br><br>
data unit format can lead to a considerable amount of<br>
redundant or duplicate data transmission. In order to avoid<br>
such a redundant transmission of data symbols, the present<br>
invention is preferably arranged in a way that will be<br>
explained in connection with Fig. 3. As can be seen in Fig. 3,<br>
data symbol stream 30, which again may be received in the form<br>
of higher layer data units a, b, c, in sequence 31, is not<br>
only recorded in terms of a first sequence and a second<br>
sequence, but in terms of a plurality of first sequences 32,<br>
32+A, 32+2A and/or a plurality of second sequences 33, 33+5. A<br>
and 5 represent respective offsets of the associated sequence<br>
with respect to the common reference point. For example, the<br>
offsets A and 5 can be expressed in terms of data symbol<br>
positions, e.g. they can be equal to one data symbol position,<br>
two data symbol positions etc.<br>
By keeping one or more first sequences 32 and/or one or more<br>
second sequences 33, the amount of redundant data symbols<br>
transmitted after a mode switch can be reduced in the<br>
following way. After switching from the first transmission<br>
mode A to the second transmission mode B, the sending peer<br>
determines the given data unit of the first of the second<br>
sequences, i.e. sequence 33, that, comprises the data symbol<br>
immediately following the last data symbol that was sent in<br>
the last sent data unit of the first format A, and determines<br>
the given data unit, of the second of the second sequences,<br>
i.e. 33+5, that comprises the data symbol immediately<br>
following the last data symbol that was sent in the last sent<br>
data unit of the first format A. The sending peer then<br>
determines which of the given data units comprises less<br>
duplicate data symbols already sent with the last data unit of<br>
the first format A, and continues the transmission with that<br>
one sequence of said second sequences 33, 33+8 to which the<br>
given data unit was less of said data symbols belongs.<br>
Naturally, the same process can be conducted in the inverse<br>
direction, i.e. when switching from format B to format A and<br>
then identifying which one of the sequences 32, 32+A, 32+2A<br><br>
contains the data unit that has the smallest overlap with<br>
respect to the previously sent data unit of the previous<br>
format.<br>
The offset can be communicated to the receiving peer in any<br>
suitable or desirable way. For example, it can be sent in a<br>
dedicated message that indicates that ail following data units<br>
have a certain offset. Alternatively or additionally the<br>
offset may be communicated by an offset indicator contained in<br>
each data unit that is sent. The receiving peer can then read<br>
the offset indicator and make an appropriate adjustment with<br>
respect to the common reference point.<br>
If the data unit transmission protocol to which the sending<br>
peer and receiving peer adhere provides for the sending of<br>
receiver status messages from the receiving peer to the<br>
sending peer, then the present invention may be embodied in<br>
the following way. The receiver status messages comprise<br>
information on the receipt of one or more of the data units,<br>
where the data units are identified in the messages in terms<br>
of sequence position indicators associated with a given<br>
sequence, e.g. the first sequence 12 of Fig. 1, or one or more<br>
of the first sequences 32, 32+A, 32+2A as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The receiver status messages can be chosen in any suitable or<br>
desirable form, can e.g. be acknowledgement messages, non-<br>
acknowledgment messages, etc.<br>
The sending peer comprises a retransmission procedure for<br>
retransmitting data units on the basis of the receiver status<br>
messages. It furthermore implements a procedure for<br>
determining one or more of the second sequence position<br>
indicators Bl - B15, Bl+δ - B15+δ associated with one of the<br>
second sequences 33, 33+6 on the basis of a given first<br>
sequence position indicator. The one or more second format<br>
data units cover all of the data symbols contained in the<br>
given data unit of the first format associated with the first<br>
sequence position indicator. For example, looking at the<br><br>
example of Fig. 3, the sending peer is able to identify data<br>
units Bb, B6 or B4+δ, B5+δ as containing all the data symbols<br>
of data unit A4 of format A. Then, the sending peer is capable<br>
of performing a retransmission procedure that retransmits the<br>
data units of the second format B associated with the<br>
identified second sequence position indicators.<br>
In other words, if the sending peer would like to retransmit<br>
the data unit carrying A4, e.g. because A4 is identified as<br>
defective in a receiver status message or has possibly caused<br>
a time-out, then the sending peer is capable of identifying<br>
the second format data units, e.g. B5, B6 that can be<br>
retransmitted in order to transport the same data symbols as<br>
contained in A4.<br>
Naturally, this process is also possible in the inverse<br>
direction, i.e. identifying one or more sequence indicators of<br>
a first sequence 32, 32+A, 32+2A on the basis of a given<br>
sequence position indicator associated with one of the second<br>
sequences 33, 33+6. An example of this is shown in Fig. 2,<br>
where arrow 28 at the bottom represents a data retransmission<br>
period. Moreover, the hatching of data units 2A and 7B on the<br>
side of receiving peer 21 symbolize that these where not<br>
correctly received and that a corresponding receiver status<br>
message (not shown in Fig. 2) was sent to the sending peer. In<br>
the example of Fig. 2, the retransmission period 28 occurs<br>
during a time where the sending peer is in a transmission mode<br>
for sending data units of the first format A. As a<br>
consequence, the defective data unit 2A is simply<br>
retransmitted as it is. However, the sending peer determines<br>
the sequence position indicators of the first sequence 12 of<br>
Fig. 1, associated with defective data unit 7B of the second<br>
format B. These data units are A5, A6, such that the sending<br>
peer retransmits data units 5A and 6A in order to transport<br>
the data symbols contained in 7B. As indicated by boxes 2 6 and<br>
27, this can lead to a certain amount of duplicate data<br>
symbols being sent. The amount of duplicate data symbols sent<br>
can be reduced by using the above described offset principle.<br><br>
In correspondence to the sending peer, a receiving peer of the<br>
present invention is preferably arranged such that it can<br>
determine second sequence position indicators on the basis of<br>
a first sequence position indicator, in order to generate<br>
appropriate receiver status messages. More specifically, the<br>
receiving peer preferably implements a procedure for<br>
determining one or more second sequence position indicators B1<br>
- B15, B1+δ - B15+6 associated with one of the second sequences<br>
33, 33+δ on the basis of a first sequence position indicator<br>
associated with one of the first sequences 32, 32+A, 32+2A,<br>
where the determined one or more data units of the second<br>
format B associated with the determined one or more second<br>
sequence position indicators cover all of the data symbols<br>
contained in the given data unit of the first format A<br>
associated with the first sequence position indicator. Then,<br>
the data unit of the first, format. A can be identified in terms<br>
of the one or more second sequence position indicators in a<br>
receiver status message.<br>
In this way, it is possible for the receiving peer to always<br>
identify data units in receiver status messages in accordance<br>
with one format. Namely, if it receives the data units in that<br>
one format, then the identification is straight-forward on the<br>
basis of the sequence position indicator contained in that<br>
data unit, and otherwise the above-described procedure is used<br>
for determining the sequence position indicator from data<br>
units of another format. For example, using the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 1, the receiving peer could generate receiver status<br>
messages that indicate received data symbols in terms of<br>
sequence position indicators associated with sequence 12, even<br>
if data units of format B have been received.<br>
Preferably, the receiving peer is capable of performing the<br>
determination in both directions, i.e. being able to determine<br>
one or more first sequence position indicators associated with<br>
one of the first sequences 12, 32, 32+A, 32+2A on the basis of<br>
a second sequence position indicator B1-B15, and determining<br><br>
one or more second sequence position indicators associated<br>
with one of the second sequences 33, 33+5 on the basis of a<br>
first sequence position indicator A1-A11. In other words, the<br>
receiving peer is preferably arranged in such a way that it<br>
can identify data symbols sent in a data unit of format A with<br>
sequence position indicators associated with data units of<br>
format B, and vice versa. This capacity is preferably combined<br>
with a procedure for generating received status messages<br>
comprising one or both of first and second sequence position<br>
indicators depending on one or more predetermined optimisation<br>
functions.<br>
Namely, the receiving peer can select which representation of<br>
data it wants to use in a receiver status message. It can<br>
choose to use the representation with respect to one format,<br>
the other format, or to mix the representation with respect to<br>
both formats. As an example, when looking at the received data<br>
units of sequence 21 in Fig. 2, the receiving peer can<br>
identify data unit 2A in terms of format A (as 2A), or in<br>
terms of format B (as E32, B3) . Equally, the receiving peer can<br>
identify data unit 7B in terms of format B (i.e. as 7B) or in<br>
terms of format A (as A3, A6).<br>
The one or more optimisation functions to be used can be<br>
chosen in any suitable or desirable way. For example, the<br>
optimisation function can be used to identify data units in<br>
the receiver status messages in terms of the format presently<br>
being used by the sending peer. In other words, the receiving<br>
peer determines that the sending peer has a transmission mode<br>
that sends format A, a i .1 data units are identified in the<br>
receiver status message: in terms of format A.<br>
A further example of an optimisation function is to optimise<br>
the size of the receiver status messages. Namely, in such a<br>
case the receiving peer is arranged to represent received data<br>
units in terms of the format that allows the shortest<br>
identification of data units, i.e. a format that corresponds<br>
to data units of large size, such that the receiver status<br><br>
messages become short:. This can have the disadvantage that an<br>
increased amount of duplicate data symbols are transmitted,<br>
because the granularity of identifying data units is very<br>
coarse, because the receiver status messages are intended to<br>
be short and thereby only very coarsely identify the data<br>
units .<br>
As a consequence, the optimisation function can also be chosen<br>
in the exactly opposite way, i.e. to allow the finest<br>
granularity, which means that the data units are expressed<br>
with respect to the format of smallest size.<br>
Now two special cases will be discussed. One special case is<br>
that the data symbol stream buffer and the sending peer runs<br>
empty for a certain period, such that the last data unit of a<br>
given format is partly filled with padding. In order to allow<br>
the receiving peer to correctly re-construct the data symbol<br>
stream, it is capable of identifying the padding (e.g. on the<br>
basis of information in the data unit header that specifies<br>
the length and position of the padding) and a certain<br>
synchronization rule. The synchronization for determining how<br>
the first data symbol of new data is addressed can be<br>
implicit, e.g. that the next data symbol is represented in the<br>
next data unit of each respective format. In other words, if<br>
padding would e.g. be contained at the bottom of data unit A5<br>
of Fig. 1, then the receiver could identify B6 and B7 as<br>
corresponding to A5, such that the next data unit of format A<br>
is A6 and the next data unit of format B is B8, such that the<br>
implicit resynchronisat ion would occur with respect to the<br>
beginning of A6 and B8. Naturally, it is also possible that<br>
the sending peer sends an explicit reference point setting<br>
message to the receiving peer, which in the above example<br>
would e.g. identify data units A6 and B8.<br>
A second special case will be described with respect of Fig.<br>
4. Fig. 4 shows a case where the data units of a given format<br>
(more specifically the payload of said data units) has a<br>
varying size. As an example, there may be an optional header<br><br>
field that is only used in certain cases and can have a<br>
variable length, such that the payload within a data unit is<br>
equally variable in order to accommodate the additional header<br>
field. An example of such a variable length header field is<br>
the length indicator field in the WCDMA RLC (radio Link<br>
Control) protocol. Consequently, the reference synchronization<br>
between format A and format B requires keeping track of the<br>
data unit size. At the side of the sending peer this is always<br>
known, and therefore no problem. However, at the side of the<br>
receiving peer this information is only available if the data<br>
units have been received correctly, if data units get lost or<br>
are damaged, then this information is not known to the<br>
receiving peer. Such a situation is shown in Fig. 4, where the<br>
data units of format A have a varying size, and it is assumed<br>
that data units 2A, 3A, 4A were not correctly received by the<br>
receiver in sequence 42.<br>
This problem can be solved by the use of the reference point<br>
synchronization message already mentioned earlier. In the case<br>
of Fig. 4, the reference point synchronization message 43 is<br>
sent at the point of time of a mode switch. The reference<br>
point synchronization message contains information on the<br>
change in reference point due to the variable data unit size.<br>
As an example, if the size of data units 1A and 4A is the<br>
standard size, and data units 2A and 3A are respectively<br>
decreased by predetermined factors, then the reference point<br>
synchronization message 43 could simply indicate the amount of<br>
size reduction in data units 2A and 3A.<br>
The above-described features of the invention can be<br>
implemented in data unit transmission devices that act as<br>
sending peers and/or receiving peers in the form of hardware,<br>
software or any suitable combination of hardware and software.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the present invention is<br>
embodied in the form of a computer program executable on a<br>
data unit transmission device.<br><br>
The present invention can especially be implemented in the<br>
context of the sending peer 51 and receiving peer 52 shown in<br>
Fig. 5. More specifically, the control part 511 can be<br>
arranged to operate as a record keeping part that<br>
simultaneously maintains the above-mentioned first and second<br>
record. Element 512 represents a switching part for<br>
dynamically switching between the above-described first and<br>
second transmission mode, and the data unit generating part<br>
510 can be arranged to act a data unit output part that is<br>
equipped such that after the switching part 512 switches from<br>
a first transmission to a second transmission mode the output<br>
part 510 continues the transmission with a given data unit of<br>
one of the second sequences comprising a position indicator<br>
such that the given data unit comprises a data symbol<br>
immediately following the last data symbol of the data symbol<br>
stream that was sent in the data unit of said first format<br>
last sent before said switching, and that after the switching<br>
part 512 switches from the second transmission mode to the<br>
first transmission mode, the output part 510 continues the<br>
transmission with a given data unit of one of the first<br>
sequences comprising a position indicator such that the given<br>
data unit comprises a data symbol immediately following the<br>
last data symbol of the data symbol stream that was sent in<br>
the data unit of the second format last sent before the<br>
switching.<br>
The control part 511 can especially be arranged to act as an<br>
information processor for determining data symbols of format A<br>
in terms of sequence position identifiers associated with<br>
format B and vice versa.<br>
Equally, the control part 521 of receiving peer 52 can act as<br>
a sequence position identifier for identifying sequence<br>
position indicators in received data units, as a switching<br>
detector for detecting a switch; in transmission mode at the<br>
sending peer. The element 520 of receiving peer 52 acts as a<br>
data symbol stream reconstruction part for reconstructing the<br>
data symbol stream on rhe oasis of the sequence position<br><br>
indicators and the switching letected by control part 521. The<br>
control part. 521 may equally act as a message generator for<br>
generating and sending receiver status messages to the sending<br>
peer.<br>
