COMPOSITION COMPRISING IT<br>
AND PROCESS FOR ITS PKEPARATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to imidazo-thladiazole-sulfonamide compounds useful in the<br>
treatment of neuronal disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems and in the<br>
treatment of proliferative diseases, such as cancer and inflammation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Applicant has previously demonstrated that selected compounds represented by<br>
Formula I, <br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently H or C(1-4) alkyl, protect SCG neurons from<br>
several neurotoxic insults, including NGF withdrawal and treatment with<br>
chemotherapeutics such as Taxol1" and cisplatin. When such agents are administered<br>
to rats treated with Taxol™, either during or after a two week dosing period, marked<br>
improvements are observed in the animal's general health, weight gain, gait, and nerve<br>
conductance as compared to animals treated with Taxol™ alone (PCT Application No.<br>
CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890)). Compounds from this class also aid in the regeneration<br>
of neurons damaged as a result of sciatic nerve crush and protect retinal ganglion<br>
neurons from ocular stroke. Additionally, cortical motor neurons are protected from<br>
malonate induced death (PCT Appication No. CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890)).<br>
Other uses of select compounds represented by formula I in which R1=R2=H include<br>
anti-bacterial agents (Gadad, A. K.EurJ. Med. Chem., 35(9), 853-857, 2000) and<br>
carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors (Barnish, I. T., et. al. J. Med. Chem., 23(2), 117-121,<br><br>
1980; Barnish, I. T. et. al GB 1464259, abandoned; Supuran, C, T. Met-Based Drugs<br>
2(6), 331 -336,1995). The Applicant has demonstrated that the introduction small alkyl<br>
groups at R1 and R2 dramatically reduce the CA activity of these compounds, while<br>
maintaining their neuronal protection in vitro (PCT Application No. CA02/01942 (WO<br>
03/051890)).<br>
One specific compound from this class, namely 5-Bromo-6-phenylmidazo[2,1-b]-1,3,4,-<br>
thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide (R1=R2=H, R5=Br, R6=Ph, abbreviated herein as 5-Br-6-Ph-<br>
ITS), has been shown to display anti-proliferative activity (Gadad, A. K. India. Arzneim.-<br>
Forsch., 49(10), 858-863,1999). However, this compound is not an attractive<br>
therapeutic agent, due to the active bromine at C5, Furthermore, the Applicant has<br>
demonstrated that this compound is rapidly degraded in microsomal fractions, limiting its<br>
therapeutic potential.<br>
Prodrugs are precursors of active forms of a drug, which degrade into the active form in<br>
vivo. The use of simple N-C(1-4)acyisulfonamides as prodrugs has been previously<br>
described for the COX-2 inhibitors parecoxib sodium and celecoxib (Talley, J. J., et. al.,<br>
J. Med. Chem. 2000 May 4;43(9):1661-3 and Mamidi, R. N., et al. Biopharm. Drug<br>
Dispos. 2002 Oct;23(7):273-82).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to imidazo[2,1-b]-1,3,4,-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamides,<br>
represented by Formula I; <br>
In particular, this application is concerned with N-acyl sulfonamides, wherein R1 is<br>
represented by an acyl group (formula l-b), and the use of such compounds for the<br>
treatment of neurodegenrative diseases and for the treatment of proiiferative diseases.<br>
The application is also concerned with the use of sulfonamides, wherein R1 and R2<br><br>
independently represent H or (C1 -4) alky! (formula l-a), for the treatment of proliferative<br>
diseases,<br>
The N-acylsulfonamides represented by formula l-b display altered solubility and<br>
pharmacokinetic properties as compared to their parent sulfonamides, formula l-a. This<br>
may be characterized by aqueous soluble formulations with neutral pH and/or improved<br>
pharmacokinetics.<br><br>
Compounds represented by formula l-b are converted in vivo to their parent<br>
sulfonamides and may act as prodrugs for the parent sulfonamide.<br>
/ACCOMPANYING <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/FIGURE<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the effects of Compounds 14,45, 39 and 31 on Cisplatin-lnduced<br>
Attenuation of SNCV. Rats treated with cisplatin display a reduced maturational<br>
increase in SNCV as compared to control animals. This loss in SNCV is prevented by<br>
treatment with compound 14 (10 mg/kg). The A/-acyl derivatives 45, 39, and 31 (3,10<br>
and 30 mg/kg), demonstrating similar potency at 30 mg/kg in this model of peripheral<br>
neuropathy.<br>

Some of the compounds described herein contain one or more chiral centres and may<br>
thus give rise to diastereomers and optical isomers. The present invention is meant to<br>
comprehend such possible diastereomers as well as their racemic, resolved and<br>
enantiomerically pure forms, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The term "subject" or "patient" as used herein may refer to mammals including humans,<br>
primates, horses, cows, pigs, sheep goats, dogs, cats, rodents, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered to subjects in<br>
effective amounts. An effective amount means that amount necessary to delay the onset<br>
of, inhibit the progression of, or haltaltogether the onset or progression of, or diagnose<br>
the particular condition or symptoms of, the particular condition being treated.<br>
An effective amount for treating a neurological disorder is that amount necessary to<br>
affect any symptom or indicator of the condition, and/or reverse, halt or stabilize<br>
neuronal degradation and/or cell loss that is responsible for the particular condition being<br>
treated. In general, an effective amount for treating neuropathies and neuropathic pain<br>
will be that amount necessary to favorably affect the neuropathies and/or neuropathic<br>
pain. For example, an effective amount for treating neurodegenerative disease of the<br>
CNS, such as Alzheimer's disease is an effective amount to prevent memory loss, but is<br><br>
not limited to the amelioration of any one symptom. Similarly, an effective amount for<br>
treating Parkinson's disease or ALS is an amount necessary to favorably effect loss of<br>
muscular function and/or control, but is not limited to the amelioration of any one<br>
symptom. An effective amount for treating glaucoma and macuiar degeneration is an<br>
effective amount to prevent loss of vision. An effective amount for treating a peripheral<br>
neuropathy is an effective amount for preventing the development or halting the<br>
progression of PNS sensory or motor nerve dysfunction, but is not limited to these<br>
symptoms or effects.<br>
In general, an effective amount for treating a mammalian cancer cell proliferation is that<br>
amount necessary to affect any symptom or indicator of the condition, and/or reverse,<br>
halt or stabilize mammalian cancer cell proliferation and/or migration that is responsible<br>
for the particular condition being treated, with that amount being the amount necessary<br>
to favorably affect mammalian cancer ceif proliferation in vivo.<br>
When administered to a subject, elective amounts will depend, of course, on the<br>
particular condition being treated; the severity of the condition; individual patient<br>
parameters including age, physical condition, size and weight; concurrent treatment;<br>
frequency of treatment; and the mode of administration. These factors are well known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine<br>
experimentation. It is preferred generally that a maximum dose be used, that is, the<br>
highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment.<br>
A variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected will<br>
depend, of course, upon the particular condition being treated, the particular drug<br>
selected, the severity of the condition being treated and the dosage required for<br>
therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention, generally speaking, may be<br>
practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning any<br>
mode that produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing clinicaiiy<br>
unacceptable adverse effects. Such modes of administration include oral, rectal,<br>
sublingual, topical, nasal, transdenmal, intradermal or parenteral routes. The term<br>
"parenteral" includes subcutaneous, intravenous (IV), intramuscular, or infusion.<br><br>
Dosage may be adjusted appropriately to achieve desired drug levels, iocally of<br>
systemically. Generally, daily oral doses of active compounds will be from about 0.01<br>
mg/kg per day to 1000 mg/kg per day. It is expected that intravenous doses in the range<br>
of about 1 to 1000 mg/m2 per day will be effective. In the event that the response in a<br>
subject is insufficient at such doses, even higher doses (or effective higher doses by a<br>
different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that patient<br>
tolerance permits.<br>
Compound may be administered as an aqueous and/or non-aqueous solution, being<br>
dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous and/or non-aqueous<br>
formulation, prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. These<br>
aqueous and/or non-aqueous solutions may contain buffering agents, co-solvents,<br>
stabilizers, surfactants, co-solvents and/or encapsulating agents. Buffers and stabilizers<br>
are described below, and co-solvents may include HPCD or other encapsulating co-<br>
solvents known in the art, PEG and the like.<br>
The solubility of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of l-a and l-b can be increased and/or<br>
stabilized by the use of an aqueous soluble encapsulating agent. Examples of<br>
encapsulating agents Include cyclodextrans, such as hydroxypropylcyclodextran<br>
(HPCD). Examples of salts include organic and inorganic salts, such as the sodium salt,<br>
as well as the salts formed from organic bases, such as ethanolamine,<br>
dimethylaminoethanol, and 4-aminopyridine. Use of aqueous 5-45% wt/vol HPCD<br>
solutions (either water or saline) are typically preferred for improving the solubility and/or<br>
stability of these componds in aqueous media.<br>
The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods weSl known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include<br>
the step of bringing the conjugates of the invention into association with a carrier that<br>
constitutes one or more accessory ingredients, in general, the compositions are<br>
prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the compounds into association with a<br><br>
liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the<br>
product.<br>
Compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as<br>
capsules, cachets, tablets, or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the<br>
active compound. Other compositions include suspensions in aqueous liquors or non-<br>
aqueous liquids such as a syrup, an elixir, or an emulsion.<br>
Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release<br>
delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the active<br>
compounds of the invention, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician.<br>
Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art. They include polymer based systems such as polylactic and poiyglycolic<br>
acid, polyanhydrides and polycaprolactone; nonpolymer systems that are lipids including<br>
sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as<br>
mono-, di- and triglycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide based<br>
systems; wax coatings, compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients,<br>
partially fused implants and the like. In addition, a pump-based hardware delivery<br>
system can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation.<br>
A long-term sustained release implant aiso may be used. "Long-term" release, as used<br>
herein, means that the implant is constructed and arranged to deliver therapeutic levels<br>
of the active ingredient for at least 30 days, and preferably 60 days. Long-term sustained<br>
release implants are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include some of<br>
the release systems described above. Such implants can be particularly useful in<br>
treating solid tumors by placing the implant near or directly within the tumor, thereby<br>
affecting localized, high-doses of the compounds of the invention.<br>
When administered, the Formulations of the invention are applied in pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions. Such preparations may routinely contain salts, buffering<br>
agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and are not excluded from the scope of the<br>
invention. Such salts include, but are noi limited to, those prepared from the following<br>
acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-<br>
toluenesulfonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulfonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-<br>
2-sulfonic, benzene sulfonic, and the like. Also, pharmaceutically acceptable salts can<br>
be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or<br>
calcium salts, or from organic bases known in the art such as, but not limited to<br>
dimethylaminoethanol, ethanoiamine argir.ine and lysine.<br>
Suitable buffering agents include: phosphate buffers, acetic acid and a salt (1-2% W/V);<br>
citric acid and a salt (1-3% W/V); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2% W/V), as well<br>
as others known in the art.<br>
Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% W/V); chlorobutanol<br>
(0.3-0.9% W/V); parabens (0.01 -0.25% W/V) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% W/V), as well<br>
as others known in the art.<br>
Suitable carriers are pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The term pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler, dilutants or<br>
encapsulating substances that are suitable for administration to a human or other<br>
animal. The term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or<br>
synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The<br>
components of the pharmaceutical compositions are capable of being commingled with<br>
the molecules of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there<br>
is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficacy.<br>
Carrier Formulations suitable for oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, and intramuscular<br>
administration etc., are those which are known in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be delivered with other therapeutic agents. The<br>
invention additionally includes co-adminstration of compound I of the invention with<br>
other compounds known to be useful in treating neurodegenerative or proliferative<br><br>
diseases. In neurodegenerative disease this is typified by but not limited to, COX-2<br>
inhibitors, NSAIDS, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for treating AD, such as tacrine,<br>
doneprizil, and rivastigmin, and L-dopa for treating PD, and ACE inhibitors and insulin for<br>
the treatment of diabetes. In proliferative diseases such as cancer, this is typified by<br>
chemotherapeutics such as Taxol, cisplatin, and the vinca alkaloids.<br>
In the case of peripheral neuropathy induced by a toxic agent, compound I would be<br>
delivered separately before, simultaneously with (i.e. independently or in the form of anti-<br>
cancer cocktails), or after exposure to the toxic agent. Preferably, compound I and the<br>
chemotherapeutic agent are each administered at effective time intervals, during an<br>
overlapping period of treatment in order to prevent or restore at least a portion of the<br>
neurological function destroyed by the neurotoxic or chemotherapeutic agent. The<br>
chemotherapeutic can be any chemotharapeutic agent that causes neurotoxicity, such<br>
as dideoxyinosine, deoxy cytizine, D4T, cispiatin, etoposide, vincristine, epithilone or its<br>
derivatives, or Taxol™/Taxoter™ and derivatives thereof, which are representative of the<br>
classes of agents which induce neuropathies.<br>
By "toxic agent" or "neurotoxic agent" is meant a substance that through its chemical<br>
action injures, impairs, or inhibits the activity of a component of the nervous system.<br>
Such neurotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, neoplastic agents such as<br>
vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin, Taxol™, D4T or other anti-virals, or dideoxy-<br>
compounds, eg., dideoxyinosine; alcohoi; metals; industrial toxins involved in<br>
occupational or environmental exposure; contaminants in food or medicinals; or over-<br>
doses of vitamines or therapeutic drugs, eg. Antibiotics such as penicillin or<br>
chloramphenicoi, or mega-doses of vitamins A, D, or B6.<br>
In the treatment of cancer where compounds represented by formula I are to be used as<br>
pro-apoptotic agents for the killing of cancer cells in vivo compound I would be delivered<br>
afone, separately before, simultaneously with (ie. independently or in the form of anti-<br>
cancer cocktails), or after treatment with traditional chemotherapeutics such as, but not<br>
limited to, Taxol, Taxoter, cisplatin, the vinca alkaloids, and 5-fluorouracil.<br><br>

Neuroprotective effects of compound represented by formula l-a<br>
Several neurotoxic agents and protocols may be used to induce apoptosis in Superior<br>
Cervical Ganglion (SCG) neurons. Several of these insults include the withdrawal of<br>
trophic support (for example Neuronal Growth Factor (NGF)), treatment with neurotoxic<br>
chemotherapeutics such as Taxol™, cisplatin, vincristine, or vinblastine, and treatment<br>
with neurotoxic anti-viral agents. Selected compounds represented by Formula I have<br>
been found to inhibit apoptosis induced by the above neurotoxic insults.<br>
The Applicant has previously demonstrated that selected compounds represented by<br>
Formula l-a (R1 and R2 are selected from H and C(1-4) alkyl protect neurons of the CNS<br>
and PNS from various neurotoxic insults (PCT Application No. CA02/01942 (WO<br>
03/051890)). These insults include in vitro treatment of SCG neurons with anti-NGF<br>
antibody, Taxol™, cisplatin, and vincristine. Table 3 summarizes s subset of the<br>
neuroprotection previously reported.<br>
Table 3: Protection of SCG neurons from anit-NGF, Taxol, cisplatin and vincristine<br>
induced cell death<br><br><br><br>
The above data demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of compounds represented by<br>
formula l-a on neurons treated with various neurotoxic agents.<br>
Several neurodegenerative diseases are related to the cellular or functional loss of motor<br>
neurons of the CNS and PNS. ALS is a characterized by motor neuron loss as a result<br>
of mitochondria! dysfunction, which can be mimicked in culture by the addition of<br>
malonate to organotypic brain slices. P1 rat motor cortex brain slices were cultured for 2<br>
weeks prior to drug and malonate addition. After an additional two weeks the slices<br>
were fixed and stained with SMI-32 antibody which selectively stains motor neurons<br>
found in layer V of the cortex. Compound 13 protected upwards of 80 % of these<br>
labeled motor neurons at a drug concentration of 1 M (PCT Application No.<br>
CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890)).<br>
Taxol™ commonly causes dose dependent peripheral neuropathies during cancer<br>
treatment. When treated with Taxol™ (9 mg/kg in Cremophor EL and ethanol) twice<br>
weekly for 3 weeks, Sprague Dawley rats displayed acute symptoms of chemotoxicity,<br>
characterized by reduced appetite, weight !oss, gait disturbance (a general marker of<br>
Taxol™ induced peripheral neuropathy), and general poor health (PCT Application No.<br>
CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890)). For example, over a thirteen day period control animals<br>
gained an average of 50 g, whereas the Taxol™ treated animals displayed no weight<br>
gain. All of the Taxol™ treated animals developed peripheral neuropathies,<br>
characterized by 'tip toe walking'. The extant of this neuropathy was analyzed by<br>
quantifying the refracted light captured by a video camera as the animals walked over a<br>
glass plate. This data was analyzed by Northern Eclipse software. The Taxoi™ treated<br>
animals displayed a 46 % reduction in foot-pad contact with the glass plate, as<br><br>
compared to control animals. Treatment with compounds 1 (10 mg/kg) resulted in<br>
normal weight gain, as compared to control, and a reduction in the severity of the<br>
peripheral neuropathies; a 23 % loss in foot pad contact was observed, as compared to<br>
a 46 % loss in the animals treated with Taxol™ alone (PCT Application No. CA02/01942<br>
(WO 03/051890)).<br>
The sciatic nerve crush model is a representative model of axonal repair and<br>
regeneration. The sciatic nerve is physically crushed with forceps at the mid-thigh; only<br>
the right leg is injured, the left leg serving as a control. The axons die from the crush<br>
point to their point of innervation. Functional loss of the axons is rapidly observed as the<br>
animals drag their right leg and the toes of the right leg no longer spread. Recovery is<br>
observed in approximately 28 days as the animals regain use of their right leg. More<br>
quantitative measurements of recovery include toe spread measurements between the<br>
digits 1 and 5 and digits 2 and 4, gait analysis and electrical conductivity from the toes to<br>
the injury site(PCT Application No. CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890)).<br>
Rats were subjected to the crush injury and treated with either vehicle control or the<br>
sodium salts of compounds 1 and 9, compounds 2 and 10 repsectively (1 and 10<br>
mg/kg). Functional recovery was measured as above and improved recovery was<br>
observed when the animals were treated with compound. For exampia, increase <br>
spread was observed for those animal treated with compound (PCT Application No.<br>
CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890)).<br>
Various diseases which result in loss of vision are related to increased inter-ocular<br>
pressure and ocular stroke or ischemia. Loss of the dorsal root ganglion (RG) occur<br>
during ischemic insult and in diseases such as diabetes and glaucoma. A model of<br>
inteV-ocular ischemia involves an invasive increase in ocular pressure which results in<br>
			the collapse of the central retinal artery. Retinal ischemia is confirmed by whitening of<br>
the iris and loss of red reflex. The inter-ocular pressure is normalized after 30 minutes.<br>
This procedure is performed on the right eye and the left eye serves as a control.<br>
Compound 1 was given either by intra-vitrial injection or via SC injections at 10 mg/kg<br>
(PCT Application No. CA02/01942(WO 03/051890)). The health of the RG neurons was<br><br>
assessed by means of histological staining of retinal slices and electro-retinogram (ERG)<br>
recordings. Histology of the control animals showed almost complete loss of the RG<br>
layer, where as animals treated with compound 1 showed healthy RG layers. Similarly,<br>
significant improvements were observed in the ERG for those animais treated with<br>
compound verses vehicle control animais.. This protection was observed for both the<br>
animals which received intra-vitrial injections and those that were treated systemically<br>
(SC) (PCT Application No. CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890)).<br>
The Applicant herein reports that compounds represented by formula l-a protect rats<br>
treated with cisplatin from developing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Several<br>
primary sulfonamides, represented by formula l-a, such as compounds 2, 6,10,12, and<br>
14, display efficacy in this model of peripherai neuropathy. The daia and a further<br>
discussion is presented later in the text (see Example 151 and Figure 1).<br>
Improved formulation of primary sullonamides represented by formula l-a<br>
The primary suifonamides, represented by compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 52<br>
through 140 have limited aqueous solubility (
compounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, represented by compounds 2, 4, S, 8, 10,12, and 14,<br>
prepared by the treatment of the parent sulfonamide with 1 equiv of NaOH, display<br>
acceptable aqueous solubility (1-10 mg/mL). Use of these sodium salts has allowed for<br>
their testing in the above animal models (PCT Application No. CA02/01942 (WO<br>
03/051890)) and various pharmacokinetic studies using percutaneous routes of<br>
administration; intravenous (IV), interperantenial (IP), sub-cutaneous (SC), and the like.<br>
The modest solubility and long term stability of these solutions can be problematic as the<br>
compounds often precipitate with time.<br>
The use-of aqueous 5-45% wt/vol HPCD solutions (either water or saline) significantly<br>
improves the solubility and/or stability of these Na salts in aqueous media, as displayed<br>
below in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Improved solubility in the presence of HDPC is illustrated, for example, for compound 6.<br>
Compound 6 is soluble at 2.3 mg/mL in water. This is significantly increased to &gt;10<br>
mg/mL, with &gt;14 day stability at room temperature, using aqueous 10 wt/vol % HPCD as<br>
co-solvent. Similar trends are observed for compounds 2,10,12, and 14. These<br>
results indicate that the use of HPCD as co-solvent dramatically improves the solubility<br>
and stability of aqueous solutions of the sodium salts represented by formula l-a. This is<br>
consistant for all o the compounds in Table 4 and is herein extended to compounds 53<br>
to 140.<br>
HPCD formulations of compounds represented by formula I also display improved<br>
pharmacokinetic properties as compared to compounds dissolved in water. For<br>
example, Compound 1 displays moderate oral bioavailability when administered by<br>
gavage at 10 mg/kg, as an aqueous 0.5 wt/vol % CMC/0.5 wt/vol % Tween 80™<br>
suspension (Cmax=0.2 g/mL). A similar semi-suspension of compound 2 (the Na salt of<br>
compound 1) provides improved oral bioavailability, however, the inter-animal variation<br>
is quite large (Cmax=0.56 g/mL, C1/2=0.9 hrs).<br>
This improved formulation has allowed for administration of compound 2 using<br>
percutaneous routes of administration, providing superior plasma drug concentration.<br>
When compound 2 is administered at 10 mg/kg SC excellent plasma drug<br>
concentrations are observed (Cmax=2.0 g/mL, C1/2=0.8 hrs). Similarly, compounds 6, 8,<br><br>
9,12,11, and 13 display good pharmacokinetic parameters (plasma Cmax=0.8 to 3.0<br>
g/mL) when administered SC at 10 mg/kg as 10 wt/vol % HPCD solutions.<br>
This improved formulation has allowed for the biological evaluation of a variety of<br>
primary sulfonamides, which were previously insoluble or unstable in aqueous media.<br>
This formulation also represents a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation in humans at<br>
concentrations of 0 to 45% wt/vol HPDC, alone, or in combination with other excipients<br>
and surfactants known in the ar of pharmacy.<br>
Compounds listed in Table 2 have been previously disclosed in PCT Application No.<br>
CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890). Their respective sodium salts and HPCD formulations<br>
thereof are herein included.<br>
Anti-cancer activity of the primary sulfcnamides<br>
Compounds represented by formula l-a display significant pro-apoptotic activity in a<br>
number of cancer cell lines including breast, lung, neuroblastoma and medullablastoma<br>
cell lines. Select ompounds represented by formula l-a display good microsomal<br>
stability (see Table 5) and therapeutic potential.<br>
In order to investigate the anti-cancer potential of compounds represented by formula I-<br>
a, 15N neuroblastoma cells lines were treated with compound and assayed for cellular<br>
viability after 48 hours. The cellular viability of 15N neuroblastomas treated with<br>
compounds 1, 5,6,11, and 13 (dissolved in DMSO) are summarized in Table 5 (see<br>
Compound 152).<br><br><br>
A significant structure activity relationship (SAR) is observed. Compounds 1 and 5<br>
displayed mild anti-cancer effect with lC50s of approximately 20 M. An increase in<br>
hydrophobic substitution at R6 leads to a 3-10 fold increase in pro-apoptotic activity.<br>
Compounds 9 and 13 display IC50S of 5 and 10 M, respectively. Compound 11<br>
demonstrates a 10 fold increase in activity over the parent compound, compound 1, with<br>
an lC50of 2 M.<br>
A significant correlation is made between the neuroprotective and anti-cancer activity of<br>
compounds represented by formula l-a. Those compounds which are more potent<br>
neuroprotective agents, for example compounds 9,11, and 13, are also more potent<br>
anti-cancer agents, and vise versa.<br>
Previous reports have demonstrated that 5-Bromo-6-phenylimidazo[2,1-/3]-1,3,4,-<br>
thiadiazole-2-sulfonamides (R1=F2=H, R5=Br, R6=Ph; 5-Br-6-Ph-ITS) displays anti-<br>
proliferative activity (Gadad, A. K. India. Arzneim.-Forsch., 49(10), 858-863,1999). The<br>
Applicant herein demonstrates that compound 11 is more potent than 5-Br-6-Ph-ITS.<br><br>
Compounds represented by formula l-a display pharamecuetically acceptable<br>
microsomal stability. In contrast, 5-Br-6-Ph-!TS is rapidly consumer by microsomal<br>
fractions suggesting limited clinical potential for this compound. The use of select<br>
compounds represented by formula l-a, therefore, represent a novel approach to the<br>
treatment of various cancers such as, but not limited to, neuroblastoma.<br>
The above assays demonstrate the pro-apoptotic potential of these compounds;<br>
however, dying cells may still stain positive, underestimating the overall potency of the<br>
compound. The Applicant has developed cloneogenic assays for these and other cell<br>
lines in order to further demonstrate the anti-cancer potency of compounds represented<br>
by formula l-a. In this paradigm, Du145 prostate, HCT116 colon, 15N Neuroblastoma,<br>
IMR32 Neuroblastoma, Daoy Medulloblastoma, and MDAMB231 breast cells are<br>
individually plated and allowed to proliferate for 48 hours. Compound is added to the<br>
culture and left on for 24 hours, at which time both compound and dead cells are<br>
washed off the plate. Fresh media is added and the cells are allowed to grow for an<br>
additional 7-10 days. The remaining healthy cells reproduce and formed localized<br>
colonies. These colonies are counted and EC50 values are determined relative to non-<br>
treated controls. The results are summarized in Table 6 (see Compound 153).<br><br><br>
When compounds 1,11, and 13 were tested in this paradigm a similar trend was<br>
observed for potency ranking of compounds 1,11, and 13. Compound 1 displays IC50s<br>
in the range of 5 to 12 M. In general compounds 11 and 13 are more potent that<br>
compound 1 with IC50s ranging from 0.75 to 8 M; usually no colonies are observed at<br>
concentration greater than 1 to 5 M. These results demonstrate the significant anti-<br>
cancer potency of select compounds represented by formula l-a, against a wide range of<br>
cancer cell types.<br>
Although 5-Br-6-Ph-ITS displays a significant activity, as compared to compound 1, it is<br>
accompanied by a dramatic loss in microsomal stability. The more hydrophobic<br>
derivatives of compound 1, such as compound 9,11, and 13 display similar or better<br>
cellular activity to 5-Br-6-Ph-ITS. These latter compounds display low micromolar, pro-<br>
apoptotic activity towards cancer cells, stability, solubility as their sodium salts, and<br>
pharmacokinetics, representing pharmaceuiically viable compounds for the treatment of<br>
a wide range of different cancer types such as, but not limited to, prostate, colon,<br>
neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and breast cancer. These cancers vary greatly in<br>
their place of origin, tumor morphology, proliferation rate, and potential for metastases,<br>
suggesting that compounds represented by formula l-a are useful in the treatment of a<br>
wide range of cancer types.<br>
Compounds listed in Table 2 have been previously disclosed in PCT Application No.<br>
CA02/01942 (WO 03/051890). Their respective sodium salts, and those of compounds<br>
represented by compounds 141 to 149, and HPCD formulations thereof are herein<br>
included for the treatment of cancer.<br>
N-Acyl sulfonamides<br>
Compounds represented by formula l-a display both neuroprotective and anti-cancer<br>
activity. These compounds display limited aqueous solubility (
their sodium salts and HPCD formulations thereof display aqueous solubility and stability<br>
in the range of 5-25 mg/mL. Solutions formulated using HPCD as a co-solvent display<br><br>
improved solubility and stability. The pH of said formulations are generally in the range<br>
of 7.6-9.2. A pharmaceutically acceptable pH range is approximately 4.5 to 8.3.<br>
The N-acylsulfonamides represented by formula l-b may be formulated at near neutral<br>
pH (7.4). Compounds represented by formula l-b display good pharmacokinetic (PK)<br>
profiles and are de-acylated (cleaved) in vivo to the primary sulfonamides represented<br>
by formula l-a. The PK profile of the free primary sulfonamide are similar to that of the<br>
Na-salts of the primary sulfonamide, delivered at the same dose. In this way, the N-acyl<br>
sulfonamides represented by formula l-b act as prodrugs for the delivery of the primary<br>
sulfonamides represented by formula l-a.<br>
The use of simple N-acetyl, N-propiony!, and /V-butanoylsulfonarnides as prodrugs has<br>
been previously described for the COX-2 inhibitors parecoxib sodiumand celecoxib<br>
(Talley, J. J., et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000 May 4;43(9):1661-3 and Mamidi, R. N., et al.<br>
Biopharm. Drug Dispos. 2002 Oct;23(7):273-82). As stated above, select N-<br>
acylsulfonamides are converted in vivo to the corresponding primary sulfonamide and a<br>
carboxylic acid. N-Acylsulfonamides display altered solubility and pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters as compared to the corresponding primary sulfonamide.<br>
The synthesis and biological evaluation of a wide range of N-acylsulfonarhide<br>
derivatives, represented by formula l-b, of the primary sulfonamides represented by<br>
formula l-a is disclosed. Select compounds are summarized in Table I as compounds<br>
15 through 51. A range of N-acetyl functionalities were incorporated in order io control<br>
gastric and/or cellular absorption. N-acatyl chain length was investigated in terms of<br>
aqueous solubility, lipophilicity and rate of metabolism to the primary suiibnamide. The<br>
N-acyl moieties range in length from acetyi (G2) to palmatoyl (C16). The complexity of<br>
the N-acetyl groups range from amino acid derivatives to polyethers. The utility of each<br>
of these groups differ significantly. Short chain N-acyl groups or polar/basic<br>
functionalities are intended to facilitate aqueous solubility for oral and/or percutaneous<br>
routes of administration. Medium to long chain N-acyl groups are intended to facilitate<br>
lipid solubility in oral and/or trans-dermal/topical routes of administration. Various di-<br>
and tri-amino acid receptors are known to facilitate active transport of compounds in cell<br><br>
types such as gastric and cancer cell lines. Thus, variation of the N-acyl moiety will<br>
effect the delivery, pharmacokinetics, and conversion rates of compounds represented<br>
by formula I-b.<br>
Deprotonation of select N-acety!sulfonamides represented by formula I-b, the free acid,<br>
with 1 equiv of NaOH yields the corresponding sodium salt. Alternatively, the sodium<br>
salt can be prepared in situ by dissolving the free acid in phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS) that has been buffered to a pH of 7.4. The solubility and stability of these<br>
solutions can be improved by the use of an aqueous soluble co-solvent such as, but not<br>
limited to HPCD. This solubility can be further improved by the addition of surfactants<br>
such as PEG 400. In general, the free acid is suspended in 10 wt/vol % HPDC (10 g<br>
dissolved in 100 mL water) and treated with 0.5M PBS (pH 7.4) such that the volumes<br>
are in a ratio of 75:25. Vortexing and/or sonication for 1-10 minutes provides a clear<br>
solution (filtration of particulate matter may be required). This is illustrated for compound<br>
15 in Table 7.<br><br>
10 wt/vol HPCD - 10 g of HPDC dissolved in 100 mL of water.<br>
20 vol/vol% PEG 400 - 2 mL PEG 400 dissolved in 8 mL of water.<br>
Compound 15 is not directly soluble in aqueous HPDC or PEG 400 but is mlldly soluble<br>
in 0.5M PBS (pH 7.4). The combination of PBS and HPCD (25:75) increases this<br><br>
solubility to 10 mg/mL. This solution is stable for greater than 4 weeks. A 2 fold<br>
increase in solubility may be obtained by using a combination of aqueous PBS, HPDC<br>
and PEG 400, as described above. The aqueous solubility of Na-15 is dramatically<br>
increased when the encapsulating agent HPDC is used, and this solubility may be<br>
further augmented by the use of other excipients such as PEG 400.<br>
The general protocol of PBS/HPCD (25:75) was useful for the dissolution of select<br>
compounds represented by formula l-b is summarized in Table 8.<br><br><br><br>
In general, the above N-acetyl derivatives are soluble at 10 mg/mL, while N-butanoyl<br>
derivatives are less soluble at 4-5 mg/mL. This drop in solubility appears to related to<br>
the N-acetyl group and does not correlate well with the log P of the compounds.<br>
Compounds 32 and 38 are not soluble using this formulation. The reason for this lack of<br>
solubility is unclear as it does not correlate with the log P of the compounds, but may be<br>
due to poor interactions of the propionyl group with the HPCD.<br>
The solubility of compound 38 was further investigated by incorporating PEG 400 into<br>
the formulation. These results are summarized below.<br><br>
Compound 38 is not soluble in binary PBS/HPCD or PBS/PEG 400 formulations,<br>
however, the combination of PBS, 10 % HPCD, and 20% PEG 40C provides a solution<br>
at 4 mg/mL, which is stable for more than 4 weeks. Compound 38 is also soluble at 10<br>
mg/mL in a non-aqueous formulation composed of 50:50 PEG 400 and ethanol.<br>
Compound 31.MeSO3H is not soluble in 10% HPCD, however, it is completely soluble in<br>
dimethylacetamide (DMAc), which may be diluted with water to 25:75 DMAc/water, to<br>
provide a 5 mg/mL solution with a pH of 5.4.<br><br>
The TFA salts 24 and 26 are not soluble in water or in 10% HPCD, however, once<br>
neutralized using the PBS/10 wt/voi% HPCD (25:75) there are soluble at 4-5 mg/mL.<br>
These compounds also represent starting materials for further elaboration of the N-acyl<br>
poly-amino acid side chains.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases such as, but not limited to, ethanolamine,<br>
dimethylaminoethanol and 4-aminopyridine, may be used to deprotonate the N-<br>
acylsulfonamide, and provide aqueous soluble formulations. In this way, addition of 1<br>
equiv of ethanolamine, dimethylaminoethanol or 4-aminopyridine to a suspension of<br>
compound 15 in 10 wt/vol% HPCD will yield a clear solution at 5-10 mg/mL.<br>
Similarly, the addition of ethanolamine (20 L) to a suspension of 25 mg of compound 15<br>
or 37 suspended in 1 mL PEG 400/ethanol (50:50) provides a clear solution, which may<br>
be further diluted up to 5 fold with water, without precipitation.<br>
Compound 150 is freely soluble in alcohols such as ethanol and may be dissolved at 10-<br>
20 mg/mL in the formulation described above (250 L PBS, 250 L 10% HPCD, and 500<br>
L 20 % PEG 400).<br>
Therefore, the disclosed compounds represented by formula l-b, and/or their organic or<br>
inorganic salts, display good solubility in aqueous and non-aqueous media, finding use<br>
in various routes of administration weil known to those in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Compound 15 is converted to compound 1 in the presence of liver micrccomes using the<br>
procedure described by Cresteil, T., et al. (Cresteil, T., et al. Am. Soc. Pharm. Exper.<br>
Therapeutics, 2002, 30, 438-445). Upwards of 50% conversion is observed after 60<br>
minutes. When incubated with rat primary hepatocytes, the conversion of compounds<br>
15, 37, and 44 to their respective primary sulfonamides, 1,11, and 13, is observed.<br>
After being incubated from 90 minutes conversion rates of 6,18, and 12 % were<br>
observed for compounds 15, 27, and 44. respectively.<br><br>
When administered to rats subcutaneously, compound 15 (10 mg/mL) is well distributed<br>
(Cmax=20 g/mL in plasma). Conversion of compound 15 to 1 is observed with plasma<br>
levels of 1 reaching a Cmax of 0.5-1 g/mL Conversion of compound 16 to compound 1<br>
is observed with plasma levels of 1 reaching a Cmax of 3 g/mL Similar in vivo<br>
conversion is observed for select compounds listed in table 5 with whole blood drug<br>
concentrations being similar to that of their respective primary sulfonamide sodium salts,<br>
represented by formula l-a, administered at the same dose in aqueous 10 wt/vol %<br>
HPCD.<br>
When treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as Taxol and cisplatin rats develop<br>
various symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Compounds represented by formula l-a<br>
and l-b prevent a cisplatin mediated reduction in sensor nerve conduction velocity<br>
(SNCV).<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin daily, for five<br>
consecutive days to achieve a final cumulative dose of 12.5 mg/kg. On the third day<br>
following the final cisplatin injection, animals received compounds SC at concentrations<br>
of (3,10, and 30 mg/kg). Dosing continued Monday through Friday for three<br>
consecutive weeks. The effect of cisplatin on peripheral nerve function, and the ability of<br>
the compounds to attenuate the cisplatin effect were determined after three weeks of<br>
drug treatment by measuring the sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) in the<br>
caudal nerve of the tail. Stimulating electrodes were used to deliver 2mA pulses once<br>
per second for 1.5min. The resulting compound sensory nerve action potentials were<br>
averaged, and the mean response onset time was determined from the averaged<br>
response. Two mean response times were determined, the second being 20 mm distal<br>
from the first. The difference in onset time between the two recordings was determined<br>
and used to calculate the conductance velocity.<br>
In general, rats treated with cisplatin display a reduced maturational increase in SNCV<br>
as compared to control animals. This loss in SNCV is prevented by treatment with<br>
compound 14 (10 and 30 mg/kg). Similarly, compounds 2, 6,10,12 are protective at 10-<br>
30 mg/mg (data not shown). The N-acyl derivatives of these compounds also<br><br>
demonstrate protective activity in this model 45, 39, and 31 (30 mg/kg), demonstrating<br>
that the N-acyl prodrugs are converted and active in an in vivo model of peripheral<br>
neuropathy. Therefore, compounds represented by formula l-b are useful in the<br>
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as, but not limited to, peripheral<br>
neuropathies (see Compound 151 and Figure 1).<br>
Taken together, compounds represented by formula l-b are novel aqueous soluble<br>
prodrugs of the primary sulfonamides represented by formula l-a. These prodrugs may<br>
be cleaved in in vitro and in vivo to yield the desired primary sulfonamides. The primary<br>
sulfonamides represented by formula l-a display therapeutic potential in the treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases (as exemplified in PCT Application No. CA02/01942 (WO<br>
03/051890)) and in the treatment of proliferative disorders such as cancer, as disclosed<br>
herein. The novel compounds represented by formula l-b are effective prodrugs of<br>
compounds represented by formula l-a. These compounds display aqueous solubility at<br>
near neutral pH, representing an alternative delivery system for the primary<br>
sulfonamides. Compounds represented by formula I are useful in the treatment of<br>
neurodegenerative diseases and proliferative disease such as cancer.<br>
Synthetic Procedures<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be prepared in the following manner.<br>
lmidazo[2,1-b]-1,3,4,-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamides may be prepared by the condensation<br>
of 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-5-sulfonamirie with various -bromoacetcphenones using<br>
known procedures (see PCT Appiication Mo. CA02/01942 (WO 03/0518S0) and<br>
references therein).<br>
Acylation of the primary sulfonamide with the appropriate acyl-anhydricle or acy! chloride<br>
in a solvent such as THF yields the desired N-acyl sulfonamides.<br><br><br>
Coupling of the sulfonamide with an appropriately protected a-amino acid or peptide<br>
fragment using 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide provides the desired A/-(2-protected-<br>
amino)acyl sulfonamide derivatives, as illustrated below.<br><br>
Deprotection using an appropriate reagent, in this case the Boc group is removed using<br>
an acid such as TFA to provide the TFA salt. The resulting N-(2-amino)acyl sulfcnamide<br>
may be further modified by method known in the art; in this case acylation with an<br>
appropriate acyl chloride. This coupling reaction works well with various activated amino<br>
acids such as succinate and pentaflourophenyl esters, however, DIC/HOBt couplings<br>
provide lower yields. The method described herein extends to all other coupling<br>
protocols known in the art which provide the desired N-acyl sulfonamide and the use or<br>
various protecting group protocols known in the art.	'<br>
Coupling of the primary sulfonamides with various carboxylic acids works well using 2-<br>
chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide as the coupling sgent.<br><br>

Example: Rat model of cisplatin induced neuropathy<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 200-225g on arrival) were intraperitoneally<br>
administered 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin daily, for five consecutive days to achieve a final<br><br>
cumulative dose of 12.5 mg/kg. On the third day following the final cispiatin injection,<br>
animals received compounds SC at concentrations of (3,10, and 30 mg/kg Dosing<br>
continued Monday through Friday for three consecutive weeks.<br>
The effect of cisplatin on peripheral nerve function, and the ability of the compounds to<br>
attenuate the cisplatin effect were determined after three weeks of drug treatment by<br>
measuring the sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) in the caudal nerve of the tail.<br>
Stimulating electrodes were used to deliver 2mA pulses once per second for 1.5min. The<br>
resulting compound sensory nerve action potentials were averaged, and the mean<br>
response onset time was determined from the averaged response. Two mean response<br>
times were determined, the second being 20 mm distal from the first. The difference in<br>
onset time between the two recordings was determined and used to calculate the<br>
conductance velocity.<br>
SNCV =	distance (20mrn)<br>
Distal onset — Proximal Onset (msec)<br>
The results of these experiments were combined, and ANOVA was performed, followed<br>
by a Fisher LSD test.<br>
Example:	Anti-cancer activity<br>
Compounds were tested for anti-cancer properties using the Alamar blue viability assay.<br>
Daoy human medulloblastoma cells of 15N neuroblastoma cells were plated at a density<br>
of 5000 cells per well of a 96 well plate and cultured in RPMI media supplemented with<br>
antibiotics and 5% fetal bovine serum. Ceiis in culture were incubated with compound<br>
for 48 hours after which time Alamar blue was added to the culture media. After 4 hours<br>
media was transferred to opaque white plates and fluorescence of transformed alamar<br>
blue was measured at excitation 535/emission 595). A1 resulted in a dose dependent<br>
decrease in medulloblastoma cell viability.<br><br>
Example: Clonogenic assays.<br>
Du145 prostate, HCT116 colon, 15N Neuroblastoma, IMR32 Neuroblasloma, Daoy<br>
Medulloblastoma, and MDAMB231 breast cells were plated in 6 well plates and allowed<br>
to grow for 5 days. Cells were exposed to compound for 24 hours, the culture media<br>
was removed and replaced with fresh media. The cells were kept in cultured for 7-10<br>
days after which colonies were counted and EC50 values were determined relative to<br>
non-treated controls.<br><br>
