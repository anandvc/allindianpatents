				<td>The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for decoding video data, and more<br>
particularly to a method constructing a frozen picture to be displayed in a video decoding system.<br>
In a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display (e.g., television display), several hundred horizontal lines are<br>
scanned from top to bottom and from left to right. In a progressive display, each line is scanned<br>
in turn from top to bottom to constitute a frame picture. In an interlaced display, the odd-<br>
numbered lines and the even-numbered lines are separately and alternately scanned to<br>
constitute a separate field picture.<br>
In a CRT display, for example, a frame picture for a progressive display consists of 480 raster<br>
lines nd the display rate (or refresh rate) is 30 frames per second. In contrast, a field picture for<br>
an interlaced display consists of 240 raster lines and the display rate is 60 fields per second. Most<br>
televisions are interlaced display devices, and the raster lines are scanned alternately in two<br>
interwoven line, i.e., all of the odd-numbered lines and all of the even-numbered lines.<br>
In a digital television broadcast, a digital video decoder (e.g., a set-top box) is used as a device<br>
that enables a television set to become a user interface to a communication channel and also<br>
enables a television set to receive and decode digital audio/video data. Such digital video decoder<br>
is also required to display frozen pictures as well as normal pictures in the digital television<br>
broadcast. For example, when a television viewer changes the channel, the digital video decoder<br>
of a television set operate to display a frozen picture while it performs initialization and/or<br>
satisfies conditions needed for a transition to steady-state video decoder/display.<br>
In an interlaced (or non-progressive) display, a frozen picture is displayed by alternately<br>
displaying two field pictures, one for the even-numbered lines and the other for the odd-<br>
numbered lines. In this mode, the digital video decoder operates to continuously output these<br>
two field pictures to a display unit (e.g., CRT display).<br><br>
When video data is recorded as field pictures, there is a 1/60 second<br>
temporal offset between the adjacent field pictures and a corresponding spatial<br>
offset for an object in motion. In case that a frozen picture is constructed with two<br>
adjacent field pictures, any motion in the picture results in spatial difference<br>
between the two fields of the picture because they are temporally separated by an<br>
one-field display period. As a result, when a frozen picture is constructed using two<br>
adjacent fields of a picture, areas of motion in the frozen picture displayed will<br>
appear to vibrate as the two fields are alternately displayed. The higher the degree<br>
of motion, the more noticeable and bothersome the vibration.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method of constructing frozen pictures which<br>
have substantially no vibration or the like in either progressive or non-progressive<br>
displays.<br>
In an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
constructing a frozen picture to be displayed on a display device in a video data<br>
decoding system. The method comprising the steps of receiving video data to be<br>
spatially and temporally reconstructed in the decoding system, the video data<br>
including fields constituting a picture to be displayed on the display device;<br>
selecting one of the fields constituting the picture; and displaying the selected one<br>
of the fields on the display device for a time period to display the fields constituting<br>
the picture. The receiving video data step preferably includes dividing a frame<br>
picture into the fields constituting a picture when the video data has originated from<br>
progressive source material. The fields constituting a picture may also be field<br>
pictures to be displayed alternately for a non-progressive display when the video<br>
data has originated from non-progressive source material, and one of the field<br>
pictures is preferably displayed for a time period to display the two field pictures.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the method for constructing a<br>
frozen picture may include the steps of receiving video data to be spatially and<br>
temporally reconstructed in the decoding system; first determining whether a<br>
descriptor of the video data for indicating types of source material from which the<br>
video data has originated is in error; second determining whether the descriptor<br>
indicates progressive or non-progressive; displaying a frame picture of the video<br>
data to construct a frozen picture when the descriptor is not in error in the first<br><br>
determining step and the descriptor indicates progressive in the second<br>
determining step; and displaying one of field pictures of the video data to construct<br>
a frozen picture when the descriptor is in error in the first determining step or the<br>
descriptor indicates non-progressive in the second determining step.<br>
When the descriptor indicates non-progressive, the step of displaying one of<br>
field pictures may include selecting one of field pictures constituting a picture, and<br>
displaying the selected one of the field pictures for a time period to display the field<br>
pictures constituting the picture. When the descriptor is in error in the first<br>
determining step, the step of displaying one of field pictures may include dividing a<br>
frame picture for a progressive display into the fields constituting a picture when the<br>
video data has originated from progressive source material, selecting one of the<br>
fields, and displaying the selected one of the fields on the display device for a time<br>
period to display the frame picture.<br>

present invention may be implemented;<br>
Fig. 2 is a flow chart for describing a method of constructing a frozen picture<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B show a sequence of field pictures and a frame picture<br>
reconstructed from two adjacent fields;<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow chart for describing a method of constructing a frozen picture<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Figs. 5A and 5B show field pictures for an interlaced display.<br>
In video data compression and decompression, an evolving set of standards<br>
are developed by the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG). They are referred to<br>
as MPEG standards. For the digital television broadcast, a typical digital video<br>
decoder (incorporated within a set-top box, for example) contains an MPEG video<br>
decoder chip besides one or more microprocessors for running the operating<br>
system.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a digital video decoder compliant with<br>
the MPEG standards and over which the principles of the present invention may be<br><br>
practiced. In the digital video decoder, a video bitstream compressed by an<br>
encoder is converted into an analog video signal through various processes such<br>
as variable length decoding, inverse quantization, inverse discrete cosine transform<br>
(IDCT), motion compensation, spatial and temporal reconstruction, and video<br>
output encoding.<br>
Of the various processes of decoding the compressed video bitstream, the<br>
present invention is pertinent to the spatial and temporal reconstruction process.<br>
The variable length decoding, inverse quantization, IDCT, motion compensation,<br>
and digital encoding of the digital video decoder in Fig. 1 are well known in this art,<br>
thus a detailed description thereof is omitted.<br>
The spatial and temporal reconstruction of digital video data, in accordance<br>
with the principles of the present invention, includes the processing of picture<br>
information relating to field and frame pictures and may further include vertical and<br>
horizontal scaling and filtering. The spatial and temporal reconstruction, in<br>
accordance with the principles of the present invention, are described in greater<br>
detail in conjunction with the description pertaining to Figs. 2 through 4.<br>
Encoded video data can be decoded as frame pictures for a progressive<br>
display or as field pictures for a non-progressive (or, interlaced) display. In case of<br>
video data compliant with the MPEG standards, a video data syntax provides a<br>
descriptor called "progressive_frame._flag" to indicate which method (i.e.,<br>
progressive or non-progressive) was used in the encoding process. In other words,<br>
the descriptor in a video data syntax is used for indicating types of source material<br>
from which the video data to be decoded has originated.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a flow chart is provided for describing the method of<br>
constructing frozen pictures, in accordance with the principles of the present<br>
invention. Assuming that the validity (or trustworthiness) of a descriptor in video<br>
data to be decoded is known, it is first determined whether the descriptor (e.g.,<br>
progressive_frame_flag) may be in error based on the validity (step 201).<br>
When it is determined that the descriptor is not in error, it is then determined<br>
whether the descriptor indicates "progressive" or "non-progressive" (step 203).  It<br>
should be noted that the determination of whether the descriptor indicates<br>
progressive or non-progressive may be performed prior to the determination of<br>
whether the descriptor may be in error.<br><br>
In case that the descriptor indicates "progressive" (i.e., the encoded video<br>
data has originated from progressive source material), a frozen picture is<br>
constructed using a pertinent frame picture of video data to be decoded (step 205).<br>
To display a frozen picture, the video decoder outputs the frame picture to a display<br>
device for a frame display period, i.e., a time period for displaying a frame picture in<br>
a progressive display.<br>
When the descriptor indicates "non-progressive" in step 203 or when the<br>
descriptor may be in error in step 201, it is necessary to modify the method of<br>
constructing frozen pictures (step 207). In this case, a frozen picture needs to be<br>
reconstructed with one of two fields constituting a picture in a non-progressive<br>
display.<br>
Fig. 3A, for example, depicts a sequence of four field pictures fd1, fd2, fd3,<br>
fd4 of an object in motion for an interlaced display. In this case, if a frozen picture<br>
is constructed with two adjacent fields, the object will appear to jump between the<br>
two field positions as shown in Fig. 3B. This may result in vibration or flicker in the<br>
frozen picture.<br>
According to the method of constructing frozen pictures in the present<br>
invention, a frozen picture is constructed by displaying one field picture for a two-<br>
field display period, i.e., a time period for displaying two field pictures in a non-<br>
progressive display.  Referring to Fig. 2 and 3A, a frozen picture is constructed by<br>
repeatedly displaying one of the field pictures fd1 and fd2 for the time period of<br>
displaying both the field pictures fd1 and fd2 (step 209). This method may<br>
eliminate any vibration or the like in the frozen picture.<br>
Upon constructing a frozen picture, video data of the frozen picture may be<br>
filtered to improve display quality of the picture (step 211). The filtering may be<br>
accomplished by performing weighted interpolation with respect to video data of<br>
vertically adjacent field pictures.<br>
In the above-described embodiment of the present invention, constructing a<br>
frozen picture requires the determination of whether a descriptor is in error and/or<br>
whether a descriptor indicates progressive or non-progressive. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, however, a frozen picture may be constructed<br>
without such determination. This is described below.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a frozen picture is constructed using one field picture in<br>
both the progressive and non-progressive display modes. In a non-progressive<br>
display, a frozen picture is constructed using the same method as in the first<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 2.  In case of an interlaced display, one of the two fields<br>
(referring to Fig. 3A) is selected (step 403), and the selected field is repeatedly<br>
displayed for the two-field display period (step 404).<br>
In a progressive display, a frozen picture is constructed using one of the two<br>
fields split from a frame picture (step 401). In this case, one of the two fields is<br>
selected (step 403) and the selected field is repeatedly displayed for the frame<br>
display period (step 404).<br>
Referring to Figs. 5A and 5B, one frame picture for a progressive display<br>
may be split into two field pictures. For example, frame F1 is split into fields f 1 and<br>
f2, and frame F2 is split into fields f3 and f4.<br>
In this embodiment, a frozen picture is constructed by repeatedly displaying<br>
one of two adjacent fields for the frame display period or the time period for<br>
displaying both the adjacent fields. For example, a frozen picture is constructed by<br>
repeatedly displaying field f 1 for a time period to display frame F1 or both the fields<br>
f1 and f2. This is possible because the display of a frozen picture is short and<br>
temporary enough to ignore whether the source material to be decoded is<br>
progressive or non-progressive. By constructing a frozen picture using this method,<br>
any vibration or the like may be eliminated from the frozen picture.<br>
