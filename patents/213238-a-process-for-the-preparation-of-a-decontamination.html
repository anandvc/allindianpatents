				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>An efficient technique is disclosed for determining a portion of a document corresponding to a captured image. When a user employs a pen to create a stroke in a document, images of the document are captured by a camera mounted on the pen. While the location of some of the images will be determined from, for example, an analysis of a pattern on the document that is captured by the image or a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the image with the document, the location of other images will be determined by segmenting the sequence of images into groups that correspond to the shape of the stroke. Information relating to located images in a segment can then be employed to determine the position of unlocated images in the segment. For example, a document search region for an unlocated image can be established based upon the position of a previous located image and a maximum velocity or acceleration of the pen. The rotation and scale of the unlocated image are estimated as the same of the located image, and the unlocated image is warped using the rotation and scale. A pixel-by-pixel comparison can then be made between the warped unlocated image and the document search region. Further, if the warped unlocated image is matched successfully, the transform parameters of the image can be further refined.</td>

				<td>This invention relates to a decontamination composition for personal use by an individual for decontamination of soft surfaces like skin, gloves, mask, clothing as well as for decontamination of hard surfaces like plastic, glass, sunmica, metal, equipments, and small arms, against toxic chemical agents and for radiological decontamination.<br>
Personal decontamination composition and kits thereof are used for decontamination against chemical and radiological contamination. Water cannot be used for decontamination against these agents as water spreads the toxic chemicals to larger areas. The radioactive materials tend to adhere to skin which cannot be removed by water. Personal decontamination kit decontaminates against these agents and mitigates the injury to the individuas exposed to such contamination.<br>
Personal decontamination composition and kits thereof known in the art consist of only one absorbent material namely Fuller's earth also known as bleaching<br>
earth. The kits in turn contains two smaller kits, one containing Fuller's earth packed in a plastic bottle and the other smaller kit also containing Fuller's earth in the form of absorbant pad.<br>
The disadvantage of the above composition and kits thereof is that when the Fuller's earth is used to absorb the toxic chemical agents, it can retain the toxic chemical only for a short period. After about an hour, it starts disorbing the vapours of absorbed toxic chemicals. Special precautions have therefore to be taken to dispose of the used Fuller's earth by burying it underground or by burning it in specially designed incinerators.<br>
Experiments on male mice have shown that probability of survival with the use of the above kit is around 60%. Even in these 60% cases of survived mice, their large skin surface is badly injured.<br>
Further limitation of the above—mentioned kit is that this kit does not contain any anti—septic agent due to which the affected/injured skin takes long time to heal up due to infections.<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to propose a decontamination composition and a kit thereof for chemical and radiological decontamination of soft surfaces like skin, gas masks, gloves, clothing, etc or for decontamination of hard surfaces like plastic, glass, sunmica, metal surfaces, arms and equipments.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a decontamination composition and a kit thereof which incorporates decontaminants for radiological decontamination, in addition to decontaminants against toxic chemical agents.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a decontamination composition and a kit thereof which incorporates active carbon which enhances retention capability of the decontaminant so that the used decontaminant is able to retain the absorbed toxic liquid agents for longer periods.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a decontamination composition and a kit thereof which contains decontaminants wherein the decontaminants used do not require any special precautions for disposal after use.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a decontamination composition and a kit thereof which contains an anti—septic chemical compound zinc oxide which helps in speedy healing up of skin injuries caused by toxic chemical agents.<br><br>
An even further object of the present invention is to propose a decontamination composition and a kit thereof which incorporates a chemical compound magnesium oxide which maintains the free-flowing property of Fuller's earth and enables puffing out the decontaminant through a hole in the cap of the plastic packing so that it can be sprayed directly to the contaminated surface.<br>
Still further object of the proposed invention is to provide a decontamination composition and a kit thereof which enables efficient absorbtion of toxic chemicals from the contaminated surface.<br>
These said and other objects and advantages will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description and an illustrated example which is intended to be typical of,rather than in any way limiting on, the scope of the present invention.<br>
According   to   this   invention   there   is   provided   a   process   for   the preparation of a decontamination comprising of:<br>
a)	the first chemical formed by mixing 60-65% of fullers earth, 20-25% of<br>
active carbon, 10-15% Zinc oxide, 5-10% magnesium oxide,<br>
b)	the second chemical formed by mixing 60-70% surfactant as herein<br>
described and a 30-40% chelating agent as herein described.<br>
Further according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the proposed improved personal decontamination kit comprises essentially of two chemical formulations, to be<br><br>
w<br>
hereinafter referred, in the description that follows, as chemical-l and chemical-2. The chemical-1 whose composition is described in the ensuing paragraphs, is kept in two smaller kits, to be here-in-after referred to in this description, as PDK-l and PDK-2. These two kits PDK-l and PDK-2 only differ in packaging forms but contain the same chemical-1. The chemical-2 whose composition is also described in the ensuing paragraphs , is kept in another smaller kit, which will be reffered to in this description as RDP. These three smaller kits PDK-l, PDK-2 and RDP are housed in the main personal decontamination kit (PDK).<br>
Chemical-l is sealed in polyethylene coated aluminium pouches which is referred to as PDK-l. PDK-l enables an individual to decontaminate his skin, gloves, mask or clothings and other surfaces where only limited area is to be decontaminated against exposure to toxic chemicals.<br>
PDK-2 containing the same chemical-1 as in PDK-l is preferably a puffer plastic bottle having a cap with a hole and attached plastic cap covering the hole . PDK-2 enables puffing out of chemical-l for decontamination of relatively larger areas of contaminated surfaces like clothing, equipment, boots, small arms, exposed to chemcial contamination agents.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, chemical-l in PDK-l and PDK-2 comprises of 60-65% , preferably 65%, of Fuller's earth, 20 to 25%, preferably 20%, of active carbon, 10-15%, preferably 10%, of zinc oxide  and 5-10%, preferably 5%, of magnesium oxide .<br>
According to still another preferred embodiment, chemical-2 kept in RDP comprises of mixture of two chemicals with 60 to 70% by weight of a surfactant sodium lauryl sulphate and 30 to 40% of a sequestering/chelating agent like tripoly sodium phosphate or sodium salt of ethylene diamine<br>
t&amp;traacetic acid(EDTA) .0.5 to 1.0 % aqueous solution of the mixture of these two chemical is prepared. The aqueous sloution, thus prepared, is preferably used by tissue paper soaked in this chemical solution and about 4 to 6 of such soaked tissue paper are further preferably packed in polyethene coated aluminium bags .<br>
According to further preferred embodiment, four numbers of PDK-1 are embodied in one personal decontamination kit. Each PDK-1 contains one decontamination pad which is made up of terene cloth/gauge of length preferably 5 to 7 inches, which is superposed with thick polyethylene sheet or polyethylene coated thick paper and is hot sealed at the middle so as to form two satchets . The two sachets are filled with 20-25g of chemical-1 of foregoing composition and hot sealed from all sides. The two sachets are folded so that terene cloth/gauge remains on the outer side and the two ends are stitched together to form one decontamination pad.<br>
According to preferred precedure for use of PDK-l, the skin/surface exposed to the chemical decontamination is dabbed gently with the ' terene/gauge side of the decontamination pad contained in PDK-1, so as to spread out the powder on the affected skin/surface. The spread out powder absorbs the toxic chemical. The excess powder is then removed by wiping off with sponge or tissue paper or a towel.<br>
According to the preferred procedure for use of PDK-2, chemical-l contained in PDK-2 is spread out on the contaminated surfaces like small arms, equipment, clothings by puffing out the powder from the plastic bottle by pressing it intermitantly. The powder absorbs the toxic chemical which is then removed by wiping it off with towel or sponge or tissue paper.<br>
According to the preferred procedure for use of RDP, the chemically soaked tissue paper is taken out from the pouch and is used to wipe off the radioactivity loaded dust particles from the affected surfaces.<br>
It is to be understood that the above description of the present invention is susceptible to considerable modification change and adaptation by the persons skilled in the art, such modification are intended to be considered within the scope of the present invention, which is set forth by the following claims:-<br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM;<br>
1 . A process for the preparation of a decontamination comprising of:<br>
a) the first chemical formed by mixing 60-65% of fullers earth, 20-25% of active carbon, 10-15% Zinc oxide, 5-10% magnesium oxide,<br>
b) the second chemical formed by mixing 60-70% surfactant as herein described and a 30-40% chelating agent as herein described.<br><br><br><br>
as claimed in claim 1 wherein said surfactant is"" sodium lauryl sulphate and a sequesterinhg/chelating agent is tripoly sodium phosphate or sodium salt of EDTA.<br><br><br></td>
