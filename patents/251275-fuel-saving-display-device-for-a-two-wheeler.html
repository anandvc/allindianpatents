Field of Invention<br>
This invention in general relates to auto mobile. In particular this invention relates to scooter type motor cycle. The   present invention relates to a "Fuel saving display device for a two wheeler" State of Art<br>
Whenever an automobile is decelerating, fuel is wasted because combustion of air fuel mixture normally required for furnishing power to the engine will not be necessary. This has been overcome by providing various known devices, which automatically makes the air fuel mixture lean by supplying more air whenever the engine is decelerating thereby constlming less fuel. These devices, even though do provide lean air fuel mixture and give lower fuel consumption, there is no visible indication or communication to the rider that he is operating in deceleration mode and consuming less fuel while driving. In the absence of this there is always a tendency for the riders to drive in steady state or accelerate the vehicles thereby consuming more fuel without their knowledge. This tendency is more likely to happen in congested traffic, planned or unplanned stoppages or when the rider approaches traffic signal.<br>
This invention therefore proposes a fuel saving display device, which will automatically lit up or give audible indication during deceleration making the rider aware that the vehicle is consuming less fuel. The display unit will not give any indication when the rider is accelerating or driving at steady speed there by warning him/her that the vehicle is consuming more fuel. This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing which illustrate, by way of example and not by way of limitation, the layout diagram of one of the various possible embodiments of this invention.<br>
Many device are already known in the art. However the known device suffer from various drawbacks.<br><br>
Accordingly what is needed in the art is an improvement that overcomes the above mentioned deficiencies of the prior art.<br>
It is to be noted that the prior art description give in detail information of the technology, method, process and system known in the art. It explain the deficiency in the related art and the object of the invention being to overcome or surmount the problem associated with the prior art. This forms the essential feature and the object of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The inventors have made great effort to provide a invoice which meet the requirement of the industry and overcome the problem associated in the prior art.<br>
To achieve the above object according to first aspect and feature of the present invention there is provided a device to improve, efficiency,.<br>
According to second aspect and feature of the invention in addition to the first feature the invention comprises a device which is unique, rugged efficient, economical.<br>
At the outset of the description which follows it is to be understood that ensuring description only illustrate a particular from of this invention. However, such particular form is only an exemplary embodiment without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
The above and other objects features and disadvantages will be clear from the following description of preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings.<br><br>
The foregoing description is outlined rather broadly preferred and aUemative feature of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing and modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should realize such equivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
A fuel saving display device for a two wheeler which will automatically lit up or give audible indication during deceleration making the rider aware that the vehicle is consuming less fuel. The display unit will not give any indication when the rider is accelerating or driving at steady speed there by warning him/her that the vehicle is consuming more fuel.<br>
The accompanying drawing is intended to provide further understanding of invention and is incorporated in and constitute a part of invention. The drawings illustrate an embodiment of invention and together with the description illustrate principle of invention.<br>
The drawing should not be taken as implying any necessary limitation on the essential scope of invention.<br>
The drawing is given by way of non-limitative example to explain the nature of the invention.<br>
For a more complete understanding of the instant invention reference is now made to the following description taken in conjunction with accompanying drawing.<br><br>
The various feature of novelty which characterise the invention are pointed out specifically in the claims which a part of description. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantage, specific objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings and descriptive matter is which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of invention.<br>
Referring now to drawing, where like numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the referred views.<br>
Statement of Drawings<br>
Figure 1 illustrating the layout of the said embodiment.<br>
Detailed Description of an embodiment of invention<br>
Sensor means are provided for sensing the rpm of the engine E, One of the possible forms the sensor means can take is the pulsar coil or the charging coil P of the magneto of the engine e, the output of the pulsar coil or charging coil being directly related to the rpm of the engine. The output signal of the pulsar coil is fed to a micro controller M.Throttle potentiometer T means are provided for the throttle of the engine. The potentiometer T is connected to the micro controller M and feeds a signal thereto from which the micro controller M determines the throttle position. The output of the micro controller M is fed to the Solenoid Valve V and a LED or audible display unit D, which is fixed to the instrument panel of the vehicle in front of the rider.<br>
Now assuming that the vehicle is running and the rider releases the throttle control, the engine speed falls as the engine decelerates. This situation is signaled to the micro controller M, which immediately opens the solenoid valve V to let in more air to the engine E, through the air filter F, bypassing the carburetor C and thus provide a lean mixture, thereby saving fuel during deceleration. Under this condition the signal from the solenoid valve also operates a LED display unit D to glow or give an audible sound communicating the rider that fuel is being saved. When the deceleration ceases or when<br><br>
the vehicle is running at steady speed, the micro controller M closes the solenoid valve V to bring conditions back to normal thereby switching off LED or audible display unit D.<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention which come within the scope of the following claims are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
