The present invention relates, in general, to ultrasonic surgical instruments<br>
and, more particularly, to an ultrasonic surgical clamp coagulator apparatus<br>
particularly configured to provide increased tissue transaction forces.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ultrasonic surgical instruments are finding increasingly widespread<br>
applications in surgical procedures by virtue of the unique performance<br>
characteristics of such instruments. Depending upon specific instrument<br>
configurations and operational parameters, ultrasonic surgical instruments<br>
can provide substantially simultaneous cutting of tissue and homeostasis by<br>
coagulation, desirably minimizing patient trauma. The cutting action is<br>
typically effected by an end-effector at the distal end of the instrument, which<br>
transmits ultrasonic energy to tissue brought into contact with the end-<br>
effector.  Ultrasonic instruments of this nature can be configured for open<br>
surgical use, laparoscopic or endoscopic surgical procedures including<br>
robotic-assisted procedures.<br>
Ultrasonic surgical instruments have been developed that include a clamp<br>
mechanism to press tissue against the blade of the end-effector in order to<br>
couple ultrasonic energy to the tissue of a patient. Such an arrangement<br>
(sometimes referred to as a clamp coagulator shears or an ultrasonic<br>
transector) is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,322,055; 5,873,873 and 6,325,811,<br>
all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The surgeon activates the<br>
clamp arm to press the clamp pad against the blade by squeezing on the<br>
handgrip or handle.<br>
Some current ultrasonic shears devices, however, have the tendency to<br>
create tissue tags. Tissue tags are the tissue that remains clamped in the jaw<br>
that is not transected after the majority of the tissue in the jaw has been<br>
transected and falls away. Tissue tags may result from insufficient end-<br>
effector proximal loading and/or lower proximal blade activity. Surgeons may<br>
mitigate tissue tags either through the addition of vertical tension (i.e. putting<br>
END5387WO<br><br>
WO 2006/042210                                                                                               PCT/US2005/036389<br>
-3-<br>
tension on the tissue using the blade) or rearward traction on the device in<br>
order to move the untransected tissue to a more active portion of the blade to<br>
complete the cut.<br>
Some current ultrasonic shears devices utilize tissue pads that close in<br>
parallel with the surface of the blade. This presents certain problems in terms<br>
of the pressure profile exerted on the tissue. As tissue is compressed<br>
between the jaw and the blade, the proximal portion of the blade defelcts<br>
under load more than the proximal portion of the clamp arm moves in applying<br>
the load against the blade. This deflection is in part created by the portion of<br>
the blade distal to the most distal node of the device.  It is also partly created<br>
by the deflection of the transmission rod proximal to the most distal node.<br>
Additionally, the fact that blade amplitude decreases moving proximal of the<br>
tip of the blade makes the situation worse since the amount of energy<br>
transferred to the tissue, even if the pressure was constant, is reduced.<br>
Current tissue pad designs utilize PTFE material to contact the tissue and<br>
blade. Although these designs have been adequate, they tend to suffer from<br>
longevity issues since the pads tend to deteriorate over long surgical<br>
procedures. Additionally, newer designs of clamp coagulator shears increase<br>
blade amplitude and/or the loading of the pad against the tissue and blade<br>
and overwhelm the pad material, resulting in less than required tissue pad life.<br>
The pad material limits the amount of force that may be applied against the<br>
tissue and blade, which in turn limits the tissue thickness or vessel size that<br>
some current clamp coagulator shears may effectively cut and coagulate.<br>
Some current designs of clamp coagulator shears utilize an inner tube within<br>
an outer tube concept to drive the clamp arm open and close. During surgical<br>
procedures the clamp arm may be subjected to axial clamp forces exceeding<br>
2.5 pounds and/or torsional abuse loads and may cause the clamp arm to<br>
disengage from the inner tube or completely from the shears.<br><br>
WO 2006/042210                                                                                               PCT/US2005/036389<br>
-4-<br>
[0017]     Some current designs of clamp coagulator shears utilize a constant force<br>
spring mechanism that prevents the application of too much force to the<br>
clamp arm and blade. Although the mechanism provides relatively constant<br>
force to the system, the spring imparts some slope to the force curve. In<br>
applications where the clamp force is low, the slope is not significant.  In<br>
applications with high clamp forces, however, the difference in force<br>
attributable to the slope over the possible range of spring compressions<br>
becomes very significant and may exceed the maximum force allowable in the<br>
blade, in the tube assemblies or in other components of the system. The high<br>
slope could allow the maximum force to be exceeded under abuse modes or<br>
through normal manufacturing tolerance variations. If this occurs the blade<br>
may bend, the actuation mechanism may fail or undesirable tissue effects<br>
may occur (i.e. fast cutting, but minimal tissue coagulation). This situation is<br>
aggravated by the fact that the jaw (the clamp arm and pad) of the device can<br>
meet sufficient resistance to engage the force limiting mechanism when the<br>
jaw almost contacts the blade (when transecting thin tissue or at the end of<br>
the transaction or clamping solid objects such as other devices) or when the<br>
jaw is still open (when transecting thick tissue).<br>
[0018]      Some current designs of clamp coagulator shears utilize force-limiting springs<br>
to ensure that clamp forces are within a specified range. It is also necessary<br>
for the force-limiting spring design to allow the surgeon to "feather" (apply less<br>
than the maximum force and slowly increase to the maximum force). In these<br>
mechanisms, therefore, the jaws close until a predetermined force is met and<br>
then the additional stroke drives the mechanism into the force limiting range.<br>
In some cases, though, the surgeon may, unknowingly, fail to apply the full<br>
force of the jaw against the tissue resulting in incomplete tissue cuts or<br>
insufficient coagulation. Alternatively, the surgeon may unknowingly release<br>
full force of the jaw against the tissue during a transaction that results in<br>
incomplete tissue cuts or insufficient coagulation.<br>

-5-<br>
[0019]     Some current designs of clamp coagulator shears utilize a foot pedal to<br>
energize the surgical instrument. The surgeon operates the foot pedal while<br>
simultaneously applying pressure to the handle to press tissue between the<br>
jaw and blade to activate a generator that provides energy that is transmitted<br>
to the cutting blade for cutting and coagulating tissue. Key drawbacks with<br>
this type of instrument activation include the loss of focus on the surgical field<br>
while the surgeon searches for the foot pedal, the foot pedal getting in the<br>
way of the surgeon's movement during a procedure and surgeon leg fatigue<br>
during long cases.<br>
[0020]      Some current designs of clamp coagulator shears have eliminated the foot<br>
pedal and provided hand activation on a stationary trigger. This may be<br>
cumbersome, especially for surgeons with large hands.<br>
[0021]     Some current designs of clamp coagulator utilize handles that are either of a<br>
pistol or scissors grips design. The scissor grip designs may have one thumb<br>
or finger grip that is immovable and fixed to the housing and one movable<br>
thumb or finger grip. This type of grip may not be entirely familiar to surgeons<br>
who use other open-type surgical instruments, such as hemostats, where both<br>
thumb and finger grips move in opposition to one another.<br>
[0022]      It would be desirable to provide an ultrasonic surgical instrument that<br>
overcomes some of the deficiencies of current instruments. The ultrasonic<br>
surgical instrument described herein overcomes those deficiencies.<br>

cutting and coagulation. If desired, ultrasonic energy can be applied to tissue<br>
without use of the clamping mechanism of the apparatus by appropriate<br>
manipulation of the ultrasonic blade.<br>
[0065]     As will become apparent from the following description, the present clamp<br>
coagulator apparatus is particularly configured for disposable use by virtue of<br>
its straightforward construction. As such, it is contemplated that the<br>
apparatus be used in association with an ultrasonic generator unit of a<br>
surgical system, whereby ultrasonic energy from the generator unit provides<br>
the desired ultrasonic actuation for the present clamp coagulator apparatus. It<br>
will be appreciated that a clamp coagulator apparatus embodying the<br>
principles of the present invention can be configured for non-disposable or<br>
multiple use, and non-detachably integrated with an associated ultrasonic<br>
generator unit. However, detachable connection of the present clamp<br>
coagulator apparatus with an associated ultrasonic generator unit is presently<br>
preferred for single-patient use of the apparatus.<br>
[0066]      The present invention will be described in combination with an ultrasonic<br>
instrument as described herein. Such description is exemplary only, and is<br>
not intended to limit the scope and applications of the invention. For example,<br>
the invention is useful in combination with a multitude of ultrasonic<br>
instruments including those described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>

generator 30 connected to an ultrasonic transducer 50 via cable 22, and an<br>
ultrasonic surgical instrument 100. It will be noted that, in some applications,<br>
the ultrasonic transducer 50 is referred to as a "hand piece assembly"<br>

by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio.<br>
[0068]     The ultrasonic surgical instrument 100 includes a multi-piece handle assembly<br>
68 adapted to isolate the operator from the vibrations of the acoustic<br>
assembly contained within transducer 50. The handle assembly 68 can be<br>
shaped to be held by a user in a conventional manner, but it is contemplated<br>
that the present ultrasonic surgical instrument 100 principally be grasped and<br>
manipulated by a trigger-like arrangement provided by a handle assembly of<br>
the instrument, as will be described. While multi-piece handle assembly 68 is<br>
illustrated, the handle assembly 68 may comprise a single or unitary<br>
component. The proximal end of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 100<br>
receives and is fitted to the distal end of the ultrasonic transducer 50 by<br>
insertion of the transducer into the handle assembly 68. The ultrasonic<br>
surgical instrument 100 may be attached to and removed from the ultrasonic<br>
transducer 50 as a unit. The ultrasonic surgical instrument 100 may include a<br>
handle assembly 68, comprising mating housing portion 69, housing portion<br>
70, and a transmission assembly 71. When the present instrument is<br>
configured for endoscopic use, the construction can be dimensioned such that<br>
transmission assembly 71 has an outside diameter of approximately 5.5 mm.<br>
The elongated transmission assembly 71 of the ultrasonic surgical instrument<br>
100 extends orthogonally from the instrument handle assembly 68. The<br>
transmission assembly 71 can be selectively rotated with respect to the<br>
handle assembly 68 as further described below. The handle assembly 68 may<br>
be constructed from a durable plastic, such as polycarbonate or a liquid<br>
crystal polymer. It is also contemplated that the handle assembly 68 may<br>
alternatively be made from a variety of materials including other plastics,<br>
ceramics or metals.<br>
[0069]     The transmission assembly 71 may include an outer tubular member or outer<br>

waveguide or transmission rod 80 may be joined together for rotation as a unit<br>
(together with ultrasonic transducer 50) relative to handle assembly 68. The<br>
waveguide 80, which is adapted to transmit ultrasonic energy from transducer<br>
50 to blade 79 may be flexible, semi-flexible or rigid. The waveguide 80 may<br>
also be configured to amplify the mechanical vibrations transmitted through<br>
the waveguide 80 to the blade 79 as is well known in the art. The waveguide<br>
80 may further have features to control the gain of the longitudinal vibration<br>
along the waveguide 80 and features to tune the waveguide 80 to the<br>
resonant frequency of the system. In particular, waveguide 80 may have any<br>
suitable cross-sectional dimension. For example, the waveguide 80 may have<br>
a substantially uniform cross-section or the waveguide 80 may be tapered at<br>
various sections or may be tapered along its entire length. In one expression<br>
of the current embodiment, the waveguide diameter is about 0.113 inches<br>
nominal to minimize the amount of deflection at the blade 79 so that gapping<br>
in the proximal portion of the end effector 81 is minimized.<br>
[0070]      Ultrasonic waveguide 80 may further include at least one radial hole or<br>
aperture 66 extending there through, substantially perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the waveguide 80. The aperture 66, which may be<br>
positioned at a node, is configured to receive a connector pin 27 which<br>
connects the waveguide 80, to the tubular actuating member 76, and the<br>
tubular outer sheath 72, a rotation knob 29 together for conjoint rotation,<br>
including the end effector 81, relative to instrument handle assembly 68.<br>
[0071]      In one embodiment of the present invention, the ultrasonic waveguide 80 may<br>
have a plurality of grooves or notches (not shown) formed in its outer<br>
circumference. The grooves may be located at nodes of the waveguide 80 to<br>
act as alignment indicators for the installation of a damping sheath 62 and<br>
stabilizing silicone rings or compliant supports during manufacturing. A seal<br>

waveguide 80 and actuating member 76.<br>
[0072]     The blade 79 may be integral with the waveguide 80 and formed as a single<br>
unit. In an alternate expression of the current embodiment, blade 79 may be<br>
connected by a threaded connection, a welded joint, or other coupling<br>
mechanisms. The distal end of the blade 79 is disposed near an anti-node in<br>
order to tune the acoustic assembly to a preferred resonant frequency f0 when<br>
the acoustic assembly is not loaded by tissue. When ultrasonic transducer 50<br>
is energized, the distal end of blade 79 is configured to move longitudinally in<br>
the range of, for example, approximately 10 to 500 microns peak-to-peak, and<br>
preferably in the range of about 20 to about 200 microns at a predetermined<br>
vibrational frequency f0 of, for example, 55,500 Hz.<br>
[0073]      In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, blade 79 is curved along with<br>
the associated clamp arm 56. This is illustrative only, and blade 79 and a<br>
corresponding clamp arm 56 may be of any shape as is known to the skilled<br>
artisan.<br>
[0074]      Ultrasonic transducer 50, and an ultrasonic waveguide 80 together provide an<br>
acoustic assembly of the present surgical system 19, with the acoustic<br>
assembly providing ultrasonic energy for surgical procedures when powered<br>
by generator 30. The acoustic assembly of surgical instrument 100 generally<br>
includes a first acoustic portion and a second acoustic portion. In the present<br>
embodiment, the first acoustic portion comprises the ultrasonically active<br>
portions of ultrasonic transducer 50, and the second acoustic portion<br>
comprises the ultrasonically active portions of transmission assembly 71.<br>
Further, in the present embodiment, the distal end of the first acoustic portion<br>

circumferential groove 74 on the actuating member 76 receives on O-ring 73<br>

[0076]     Rotation of the actuating member 76 together with tubular outer sheath 72<br>

these components and rotation knob 29. Tubular actuating member 76<br>
includes an elongated slot 31 through which the connector pin 27 extends to<br>
accommodate reciprocal movement of the actuating member 76 relative to the<br>
outer sheath 72 and inner waveguide 80.<br>
[0077]     The force limiting mechanism 91 provides a portion of the clamp drive<br>
mechanism of the instrument 100, which affects pivotal movement of the<br>
clamp arm 56 by reciprocation of actuating member 76. The clamp drive<br>
mechanism further includes a drive yoke 33 which is operatively connected<br>
with an operating trigger 34 of the instrument, with the operating trigger 34<br>
thus interconnected with the reciprocable actuating member 76 via drive yoke<br>
33 and force limiting mechanism 91. Trigger 34 is rotatably connected to drive<br>

action provided by trigger 34 and cooperating handgrip 68 facilitates<br>
convenient and efficient manipulation and positioning of the instrument, and<br>
operation of the clamping mechanism at the distal portion of the instrument<br>
whereby tissue is efficiently urged against the blade 79.   Movement of trigger<br>

[0079]     With particular reference to FIGS. 1-4, therein is illustrated one embodiment<br>
of clamp member 60 for use with the present ultrasonic surgical instrument<br>
100 and which is configured for cooperative action with blade 79. The clamp<br>
member 60 in combination with blade 79 is commonly referred to as the end<br>
effector 81, and the clamp member 60 is also commonly referred to as the<br>
jaw. The clamp member 60 includes a pivotally movable clamp arm 56, which<br>
is connected to the distal end of outer sheath 72 and actuation member 76, in<br>
combination with a tissue engaging pad or clamp pad 58. In one expression<br>
of the embodiment, clamp pad 58 is formed from TEFLON® trademark name<br>
of E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company, a low coefficient of friction<br>
polymer material, or any other suitable low-friction material. Clamp pad 58<br>
mounts on the clamp arm 56 for cooperation with blade 79, with pivotal<br>
movement of the clamp arm 56 positioning the clamp pad in substantially<br>
parallel relationship to, and in contact with, blade79, thereby defining a tissue<br>
treatment region. By this construction, tissue is grasped between clamp pad<br>
58 and blade 79. As illustrated, clamp pad 58 may be provided with non-<br>
smooth surface, such as a saw tooth-like configuration to enhance the<br>
gripping of tissue in cooperation with the blade 79. The saw tooth-like<br>
configuration, or teeth, provide traction against the movement of the blade.<br>
The teeth also provide counter traction to the blade and clamping movement.<br>
As would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the saw tooth-like<br>
configuration is just one example of many tissue engaging surfaces to prevent<br>
movement of the tissue relative to the movement of the blade 79. Other<br>
illustrative examples include bumps, criss-cross patterns, tread patterns, a<br>
bead or sand blasted surface, etc.<br>
[0080]      With particular reference to Fig. 3a, a first expression of the current<br>
embodiment includes a clamp pad 58 having a proximal portion 58b that is<br>
smoother than a distal portion 58a, such that proximal portion 58b may be<br>
devoid of saw-tooth-like teeth or other tissue engaging surfaces<br>
contemplated. Utilizing a smooth proximal portion 58b on clamp pad 58<br>

motion of the blade, to the more active region of the blade 79 to prevent tissue<br>
tagging. This concept takes advantage of the inherent motion profile of blade<br>
79. Due to sinusoidal motion, the greatest displacement or amplitude of<br>
motion is located at the most distal portion of blade 79, while the proximal<br>
portion of the tissue treatment region is on the order of 50% of the distal tip<br>
amplitude. During operation, the tissue in the proximal region of end effector<br>
(area of portion 58b) will desiccate and thin, and the distal portion of end<br>
effector 81 will transect tissue in that distal region, thereby allowing the<br>
desiccated and thin tissue within the proximal region to slide distally into the<br>
more active region of end effector 81 to complete the tissue transaction.<br>
[0081]      In a second expression of the current embodiment, clamp pad 58 consists of<br>
one single pad having a smooth proximal end 58b and a distal portion 58a<br>
that comprises a saw tooth-like configuration. In a third expression of the<br>
current embodiment, clamp pad 58 may consist of two separate components,<br>
distal portion 58a' that comprises saw tooth-like teeth and proximal portion<br>
58b' that is smoother relative to distal portion 58a'. The advantage of two<br>
separate components 58a' and 58b' is that each pad may be constructed from<br>
different materials.   For example, having a two-piece tissue pad allows the<br>
use of a very lubricious material at the distal end that is not particularly<br>
resistant to high temperatures compared to a very high temperature material<br>
at the proximal end that is not particularly lubricious because the proximal end<br>
is an area of lower amplitude. Such a configuration matches the tissue pad<br>
materials to the amplitude of the blade 79.<br>
[0082]      In a fourth expression of the current embodiment of the present invention,<br>
clamp pad 58a' is formed from TEFLON® or any other suitable low-friction<br>
material. Clamp pad 58b' is formed from a base material and at least one<br>
filler material, which is a different material from the base material. The<br>
surface of proximal clamp pad 58b' may be smoother than distal clamp pad<br>
58a', or proximal clamp pad 58b' may also have a similar type saw-tooth<br>
configuration.<br>

[0083]     Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the<br>
expressions of the invention. Having a tissue pad with a base material and at-<br>
least-one filler material allows the base material and the at-least-one filler<br>
material to be chosen with a different hardness, stiffness, lubricity, dynamic<br>
coefficient of friction, heat transfer coefficient, abradability, heat deflection<br>
temperature, glass transition temperature and/or melt temperature to improve<br>
the wearability of the tissue pad, which is important when high clamping<br>
forces are employed because tissue pads wear faster at higher clamping<br>
forces than at lower clamping forces. Applicants found, in one experiment,<br>
that a 15% graphite-filled polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad showed<br>
substantially the same wear with a 7 pound clamping force as a 100%<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene tissue pad showed with a 1.5 pound clamping force.<br>
Having a flexible clamping arm and/or a flexible tissue pad should also<br>
improve the wearability of the tissue pad due to the ability of the flexible<br>
member to more evenly distribute the load across the entire surface of the<br>
tissue pad. Further benefits and expressions of this embodiment are<br>
disclosed in United States provisional patent application, serial number<br>

The advantage of a 15% graphite-filled, 30% PTFE-filled polyimide tissue pad<br>
is increased heat resistance, which improves the overall wear resistance of<br>
the tissue pad. This poiyimide-composite clamp pad has a useful heat<br>
resistance up about 800°F to about 1200°F, as compared to a useful heat<br>
resistance up to about 660°F of a PTFE clamp pad.   Alternatively, Other<br>
materials are also useful for a portion of the tissue pad (that is element 58b'),<br>
such as ceramics, metals, glasses and graphite.<br>
[0085]     Referring to FIGS. 3a-e, one expression of clamp arm 56 has different shaped<br>
slots for accepting two or more tissue pads. This configuration prevents mis-<br>
loading of the tissue pads and assures that the appropriate pad is loaded at<br>
the correct location within clamp arm 56. For example clamp arm 56 may<br>
comprise a distal T-shaped slot 53a for accepting a T-shaped flange 53b' of<br>
distal clamp pad 58a' and a proximal wedged-shaped or dove tailed-shaped<br>
slot 55a for accepting a wedge-shaped flange 55b' of proximal clamp pad<br>
58b'. Tab stop 51 engages the proximal end of proximal clamp pad 58b' to<br>
secure the clamp pads onto clamp arm 56. As would be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art, flanges 53b' and 55b' and corresponding slots 53a and 55a<br>
may have alternate shapes and sizes to secure the clamp pads to the clamp<br>
arm. The illustrated flange configurations shown are exemplary only and<br>
accommodate the particular clamp pad material of one embodiment, but the<br>
particular size and shape of the flange may vary, including, but not limited to,<br>
flanges of the same size and shape. For unitary tissue pads, the flange may<br>
be of one configuration. Further, other tab stops are possible and may<br>
include any of the multiple methods of mechanically attaching the clamp pads<br>
to the clamp arm, such as rivets, glue, press fit or any other fastening means<br>
well know to the artisan.<br>
[0086]     In a second expression of the current embodiment, clamp pads 58a and 58b<br>
are cut on a bias so the interface between the two pads creates an overlap to<br>
minimize gapping (Figs. 4a, 4b). For example, a 45 degree biased cut does<br>

minimized.<br>
[0087]      In a third expression of the current embodiment, clamp arm 56 increases in its<br>
height dimension from the distal end to the proximal end (D1 
Preferably, D2 is from about 105% to about 120% greater than D1 and more<br>
preferably, D2 is from about 108% to about 113% greater than D1, and most<br>
preferably, D2 is about 110% greater than D1. Slot 153 accepts the flanges<br>
from one clamp pad 58 or two clamp pads 58a and 58b. Tapered clamp arm<br>
56 allows for the use of use flat pads and increases the pressure in the<br>
proximal portion of end effector 81 as well as the interference with blade 79.<br>
When clamp arm 56 deflects at a greater rate than the blade 79, pressure still<br>
exists at the tissue pad and blade interface and no gap is created.<br>
Additionally, the increased pressure helps to offset the decreased blade<br>
amplitude at the proximal end of blade 79 and provides a relatively constant<br>
pressure between the clamp pad 58 and blade 79.<br>
[0088]     A first expression for a method for inserting clamp pads includes a) inserting<br>
first and second clamp pads having a first-shaped flange into a clamp arm 56<br>
having a slot that accepts the first-shaped flange; and b) engaging a pad stop<br>
to secure the damp pads within the clamp arm. In a second expression of<br>

third and fourth clamp pads into the clamp arm; and e) engaging a pad stop to<br>
secure the third and fourth clamp pads within the clamp arm. In a second<br>
expression of this method one of the third and fourth clamp pads may be<br>
fabricated from a polymeric material such as TEFLON, and the other clamp<br>
pad may be fabricated from a base material and at least one filler material,<br>
which is a different material from the base material and that clamp arm is<br>
fabricated from metal, such as stainless steel, or titanium. The tissue<br>
surfaces of the clamp pads may be smooth or have tissue gripping features,<br>
such as a saw-tooth configuration.<br>
[0091]      Referring now to FIG. 4, pivotal movement of the clamp member 60 with<br>
respect to blade 79 is affected by the provision of a pair of pivot points on the<br>
clamp arm 56 that interface with the outer tube 72 and inner tube 76<br>
respectively. The outer tube 72 is grounded to handle 68 through rotation<br>
knob 29. Clamp arm 56 is pivotally connected to outer tube 72 via<br>
corresponding through holes 52a and 52b on clamp arm 56 and 52c and 52d<br>
on outer tube 72. A securing pin or rivet 57 slides through holes 52a-d to<br>
secure clamp arm 56 to outer tube 72. In one embodiment pin 57 is laser<br>
welded to clamp arm 56 so that pin 57 is fixed to clamp arm 56 and rotates<br>
relative to outer sheath 72.<br>

[0092]     Inner tube 76 translates along the longitudinal axis of outer tube 72 and is<br>
grounded to the handle 68 through rotation knob 29.   Pivot studs 54a,b (54a<br>
not shown) on clamp arm 56 engage pivot holes 54c,d (54d not shown) at the<br>
distal end of inner tube 76. The pivotal connection of clamp arm 56 to the<br>
inner and outer tubes 76, 72 provide more robustness to the end effector 81<br>
and minimize failure modes due to excessive axial or torsional abuse loads.<br>
Further, the embodiment increases the effectiveness of the end effector 81 to<br>
provide clamp forces in excess of 1.5 lbs. Reciprocal movement of the<br>
actuating member 76, relative to the outer sheath 72 and the waveguide 80,<br>
thereby affects pivotal movement of the clamp arm 56 relative to the end-<br>
blade 79.<br>
[0093]      FIG. 4c illustrates a force diagram and the relationship between the actuation<br>
force FA (provided by actuation member 76) and transection force FT<br>
(measured at the midpoint of the optimal tissue treatment area).<br>
[0094]      FT = FA(X2/X1)                                       Equation [1]<br>
[0095]     Where FA equals the spring preload of proximal spring 94 (less frictional<br>
losses), which,in one embodiment, is about 12.5 pounds, and FT equals about<br>
4.5 pounds as shown in FIG. 16c. FIG. 16c provides a graphical illustration of<br>
FT and FA as a function of trigger 34 movement as well as input forces at<br>
trigger 34.<br>
[0096]     FT is measured in the region of the clamp arm/blade interface where optimal<br>
tissue treatment occurs as defined by tissue marks 61a and 61b. Tissue<br>
marks 61a, b are etched or raised on clamp arm 56 to provide a visible mark<br>
to the surgeon so the surgeon has a clear indication of the optimal tissue<br>
treatment area. Tissue marks 61a, b are about 7mm apart in distance, and<br>
more preferably 5mm apart in distance.<br>

the transmission assembly 71 to the ultrasonic transducer 50 in ultrasonic-<br>
transmitting relationship, the proximal portion of the outer sheath 72 may be<br>
provided with a pair of wrench flats 46. The wrench flats 46 allow torque to be<br>
applied by a suitable torque wrench or the like to thereby permit the<br>
waveguide 80 to be joined to the ultrasonic transducer 50. The ultrasonic<br>
transducer 50, as well as the transmission assembly 71, is thus rotatable, as a<br>
unit, by suitable manipulation of rotation knob 29, relative to handle assembly<br>
68 of the instrument. The interior of handle assembly 68 is dimensioned to<br>
accommodate such relative rotation of the ultrasonic transducer 50. A spring<br>
28 is loaded against rotation knob 29 and an inner housing surface 65.<br>
Spring 28 provides a compression or force against rotation knob 29 to inhibit<br>
inadvertent rotation of end effector 81.<br>
[0098]      Referring now to FIGS. 2, 5, 6 and 16, force limiting mechanism 91 provides a<br>
first and second compression spring, distal spring 96 and proximal spring 94.<br>
Distal spring 96 is operationally coupled to yoke 33, which in turn is driven by<br>
trigger 34. Proximal spring 94 is in operational relationship with distal spring<br>
96. Distal spring 96 generates the end effector load and proximal spring 94<br>
maintains the consistency of the end effector load. As a result, the end<br>
effector load is more tightly controlled and component abuse load conditions<br>
are reduced. Washers 97 and 95 are a safe guard against distal spring 96<br>
being fully compressed (FIG. 5), thereby preventing the spring material to<br>
yield and render spring 96 useless in subsequent clamp arm closures. As<br>
would be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the application of a dual spring<br>
force limiting system has applicability in other energy-based surgical devices .<br>
(such as RF, microwave and laser) that encounter clamping forces, as well as<br>
mechanical devices, such as, clip appliers, graspers and staplers.<br>
[0099]      In one expression of the current embodiment, distal spring 96 has a spring<br>
constant greater than 100 pounds per inch and preferably greater than 125<br>
pounds per inch and most preferably about 135 pounds per inch. It is not<br>
required that distal spring 96 be preloaded, but may be preloaded at less than<br>

10 pounds, and preferably less than 5 pounds, and most preferably at about 1<br>
pound. Proximal spring 94 has a spring constant greater than 25 pounds per<br>
inch and preferably greater than 50 pounds per inch and most preferably<br>
about 70 pounds per inch. Proximal spring 94 is preloaded to a force<br>
necessary to achieve the desired transection force as noted in Equation 1,<br>
above, and is a function of the mechanical advantage of the clamp arm 56<br>
coupling means and frictional losses in the device.   In a second expression of<br>
the current embodiment, proximal spring 94 is preloaded at about 12.5<br>
pounds.<br>
[00100]    Referring now to FIG. 16a, curve 82 illustrates actuation member 76 force and<br>
curve 83 represents trigger 34 force as a function of the angular rotation of<br>
trigger 34 (on the x-axis, -18.0 is the clamp arm 56 fully open and 0.0 is the<br>
clamp arm fully closed and against blade 79) under no tissue or minimal<br>
tissue load operation. Point 82a represents the point at which yoke 33 begins<br>
to deflect or compress distal spring 96 and the actuation member 76 force<br>
increases as trigger 34 is depressed further until the force reaches the<br>
preload value of proximal spring 94 at inflection point 82b, and the slope of<br>
the force curve decreases.<br>
[00101]    In FIG. 16b, curve 84 illustrates actuation member 76 force and curve 85<br>
represents trigger 34 force as a function of the angular rotation of trigger 34<br>
under abusive tissue load operation, whereby tissue completely fills the end<br>
effector in the open position. Point 84a represents the point at which yoke 33<br>
begins to deflect or compress distal spring 96 and the actuation member 76<br>
force increases as trigger 34 is depressed until the force reaches the preload<br>
value of proximal spring 94 at inflection point 84b, at which point the slope of<br>
the force curve decreases.<br>
[00102]    Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 5, surgical instrument 100 further provides for a<br>
means for indicating to the surgeon that the trigger has reached full travel and<br>
the clamp arm 56 is applying the correct coaptation force to the tissue. This is<br>
useful during protracted surgical operations or tissue transection activities<br>

[00103]    In one expression of the current embodiment, a detent spring 110 is<br>
supported within a detent support 112 located within housing portion 69. A<br>
detent tab 114 on trigger 34 engages and snaps back detent spring 110 when<br>
trigger 34 is fully closed or actuation member 76 has reached it most proximal<br>
travel. Detent spring 110 is generally planar and made of a flexible plastic<br>
that adequately deflects when it engages tab 114 thereby providing an audible<br>
and/or tactile signal to the surgeon that there is full end effector 81 closure.<br>
Advantageously, tab 114 strikes and deflects detent spring 110 when trigger<br>
34 is rotated from the full closure position and in the opposite direction<br>
thereby providing an audible and/or tactile signal to the surgeon that full<br>
closure of end effector 81 no longer exists. As would be appreciated by the<br>
skilled artisan, the indicating means may be either tactile, audible or visual or<br>
a combination. Various types of indicators may be used including dome<br>
switches, solid stops, cantilever springs or any number of mechanical or<br>
electrical switches known to those skilled in the art. Further various means<br>
may be used to provide feedback to the surgeon, including, but not limited to,<br>
lights, buzzers, and vibratory elements.<br>
[00104]    Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2 and 6-8 housing 68 includes a proximal end, a<br>
distal end, and a cavity 59 extending longitudinally therein. Cavity 59 is<br>
configured to accept a switch assembly 300 and the transducer assembly 50,<br>
which interfaces with housing 68 via switch assembly 300.<br>
[00105]    Transducer 50 includes a first conductive ring 400 and a second conductive<br>
ring 410 which are securely disposed within the transducer body 50. In one<br>
expression of the current embodiment, first conductive ring 400 comprises a<br>
ring member, which is disposed between the transducer 50 and the horn 130.<br>
Preferably the first conductive ring 400 is formed adjacent to or as part of the<br>
flange member 160 within the cavity 162 and is electrically isolated from other<br>

electrical components. The first conductive ring 400 is anchored to and<br>
extends upwardly from a non-conductive platform or the like (not shown)<br>
which is formed within the transducer body 50. The first conductive ring 400<br>
is electrically connected to the cable 22 (FIG. 1) by means of one or more<br>
electrical wires (not shown), which extend along the length of the transducer<br>
body 50 to the first conductive ring 400.<br>
[00106]   The second conductive ring 410 of the transducer 50 similarly comprises a<br>
ring member that is disposed between the transducer body 150 and the horn<br>
130. The second conductive ring 410 is disposed between the first conductive<br>
ring 400 and the horn 130 and therefore the first and second conductive rings<br>
400, 410 are concentric members. The second conductive ring 410 is<br>
likewise electrically isolated from the first conductive ring 400 and other<br>
electrical components contained within the transducer 50. Similar to the first<br>
conductive ring 400, the second conductive ring 410 preferably is anchored to<br>
and extends upwardly from the non-conductive platform. It will be understood<br>
that the first and second conductive rings 400, 410 are sufficiently spaced<br>
from one another so that they are electrically isolated from each other. This<br>
may be accomplished by using one or more spacers 413 disposed between<br>
the first and second conductive rings 400, 410 or between the rings 400, 410<br>
and other members within the transducer 50. The second conductive ring 410<br>
is also electrically connected to the cable 22 (FIG. 1) by means of one more<br>
electrical wires (not shown), which extend along the length of the transducer<br>
50 to the second conductive ring 410. The second conductive ring 410 is thus<br>

[00108]   Switch assembly 300 comprises a pushbutton assembly 310, a flex circuit<br>
assembly 330, a switch housing 350, a first spring slip ring conductor 360 and<br>
a second spring slip ring conductor 370. Switch housing 350 is generally<br>
cylindrical and is supported within handle assembly 68 by way of<br>
corresponding supporting mounts on switch assembly 350 and housing<br>
portions 69 and 70. Housing 350 defines a first cavity 353, a mounting boss<br>
352 and a second cavity 351. Cavity 353 is sized to accept the proximal end<br>
of transducer 50, whereby horn 130 passes through cavity 351 to interface<br>
with transmission rod 80. Mounting boss 352 accepts slip ring conductors<br>
360 and 370, which in turn electrically engage ring contacts 400 and 410,<br>
respectively. An alignment pin 354 and snap-fit pin 355 align with<br>
corresponding apertures of the flex circuit assembly 330 and pushbutton<br>
assembly 310 to secure all components together as discussed below.<br>
[00109]    With particular reference now to FIG. 8a, slip ring conductors 360 and 370 are<br>
generally open-ended O-shaped springs that slip onto mounting boss 352.<br>
Each spring slip-ring comprises two pressure point contacts (361 a-b and<br>
371 a-b) that contact the respective ring conductor 400 and 410 of transducer<br>
50. The spring tension of the slip rings 360 and 370 cause positive contact<br>
between contacts 361 a-b, 371 a-b and conductors 400 and 410. It is evident<br>
that the slip-ring construction allows electrical contact to be made even as<br>
transducer 50 may be rotated by the surgeon during use of the instrument.<br>
Posts 364 and 374 of the respective slip rings electrically connect to the<br>
respective conductor within flex circuit 330 to complete the electrical circuit as<br>
shown in Fig. 8c.<br>
[00110]   A flex circuit 330 provides for the electro-mechanical interface between<br>
pushbuttons 311a, b, 312a, b and the generator 30 via transducer 50. Flex<br>
circuit comprises four dome switches 332a,b and 334a, b that are<br>
mechanically actuated by depressing pushbuttons 311 a, b or 312a, b,<br>
respectively of corresponding pushbutton assembly 310. Dome switches 332<br>
and 334 are electrical contact switches, that when depressed provide an<br>

electrical signal to generator 30 as shown by the electrical wiring schematic of<br>
Fig. 8c. Flex circuit 330 also comprises two diodes within a diode package<br>
336, also illustrated in Fig. 8c. Flex circuit 330 provides conductors, 335 and<br>
337 as is known to those in the art, that connect to slip ring conductors 360<br>
and 370 via electrical tabs 364 and 374, respectively, which in turn provide<br>
electrical contact to ring conductors 400 and 410, which in turn are connected<br>
to conductors in cable 22 that connect to generator 30. Tabs 364 and 374 are<br>
soldered to conductors 335 and 337.<br>
[00111]    Flex circuit 330 generally wraps around switch housing 350 so that dome<br>
switches 334a, b and 332a, b interface with the corresponding backing<br>
surfaces 356a, b and 358a, b on switch housing 350. Backing surfaces<br>
provide a firm support for the dome switches during operation, discussed<br>
below. Dome switches 334a, b and 332a, b may be fixedly attached to<br>
backing surfaces 356a, b and 358a, b by any convenient method, such as, an<br>
adhesive. Flex circuit is secured to switch housing 350 via alignment pin 354<br>
and snap-fit pin 355 on switch assembly 350 and corresponding alignment<br>
hole 338 and snap-fit hole 339 on flex circuit 330.<br>
[00112]    Layered on top of flex circuit is pushbutton assembly 310, which has a<br>
corresponding saddle-shape as flex circuit 330, and generally wraps around<br>
switch housing 350. Pushbutton assembly 310 comprises four pushbuttons,<br>
distal pushbuttons 312a, b and proximal pushbuttons 311a, b which have<br>
corresponding pressure studs 315a, b and 314a, b. The pushbuttons are<br>
connected to cantilever elements 313a, b and 316a, b, which provide a<br>
spring-back action after the pushbuttons are depressed. As is readily<br>
apparent, by depressing pushbuttons 311 and 312 the corresponding<br>
pressure studs 314 and 315 depress against corresponding dome switches<br>
334 and 332 to activate the circuit illustrated in FIG. 8c. Switches 312a and b<br>
are in parallel so that a surgeon may operate the pushbuttons using either a<br>
left hand or a right hand. Likewise, switches 311a and b are in parallel so that<br>
a surgeon may operate the pushbuttons using either a left hand or a right<br>

hand. When the surgeon depresses either switch 312a or 312b, the<br>
generator will respond with a certain energy level, such as a maximum<br>
("max") power setting; when the surgeon depresses either switch 311a or<br>
311 b, the generator will respond with a certain energy level, such as a<br>
minimum ("min") power setting, which conforms to accepted industry practice<br>
for pushbutton location and the corresponding power setting.<br>
[00113]    Alternatively, the pushbuttons may be molded into the switch housing 350 or<br>
into the handle assembly 68 to reduce the number of components and<br>
increase the reliability of the overall device. The pushbuttons may be<br>
attached through small cantilever sections, which allow for sturdy attachment<br>
of the pushbutton to the other components, while at the same time allowing<br>
for a low force to activate the pushbuttons.<br>
[00114]    Referring now to FIGS. 12-15, one expression of the current embodiment<br>
allows switches 311a, b and 312a, b configured in such a way to provide an<br>
ergonomically pleasing grip and operation for the surgeon. Switches may be<br>
placed in the range of the natural swing of the surgeon's thumb, whether<br>
gripping surgical instrument 100 right-handed or left handed. In a second<br>
expression of the current embodiment, the switches are placed on housing 68<br>
to prevent inadvertent button activation on the side of the instrument opposite<br>
the thumb while the surgeon depresses trigger 34 or rotates rotation knob 29.<br>
In a third expression of the current embodiment a series of partitions, such as<br>
ridges and/or depressions or "peaks and valleys" that are integrated onto the<br>
housing 68.  In one example the housing defines a first surface and the series<br>
of partitions define at least one second surface such that the second surface<br>
is higher than the housing surface. The partition may also define a third<br>
surface that is lower than the housing surface. As can be seen in FIGS. 1, 2<br>
switches 312a, b are surrounded by an upper ridge 320 and a lower ridge<br>
324. Ridges 320 and 324 may be discrete physical features, both separated<br>
from each other, or ridges 320 and 324 may be continuous in nature without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention. Further, the ridges 320 and 324<br>

may continue across the entire upper portion of housing 68, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 12-15, or ridges 320 and 324 may be more discrete as shown in FIGS.<br>
1 and 2. This construction and situation of switches 312a, b prevent the risk<br>
of inadvertent button activation even if a finger crosses over the button due to<br>
the fact that the ridges cause the finger to pass above the plane of the button.<br>
The ridges also provide tactile feedback to the surgeon as to the location of<br>
the pushbuttons and whether the button represents rnin or max power<br>
activation. As is readily evident, switches 312a, b are surrounded by ridges<br>
320 and 324 and pushbuttons 311a,b are situated above and proximal of<br>
ridge 320. Such tactile feedback is essential to the surgeon, so the surgeon<br>
may continuously assess the surgical site, but confidently understand which<br>
pushbuttons are being activated. In a further expression of the current<br>
embodiment, switch 312a, b are nestled within a depression 322 and further<br>
surrounded by ridges 320 and 324.<br>
[00115]   Referring to FIG. 12, a surgeon's left hand is accessing instrument 100. The<br>
fore finger and middle finger are poised to activate trigger 34, and the ring<br>
finger and pinkie grasp hand grip 39. The thumb is conveniently positioned to<br>
sweep upward to activate pushbutton 312a or 311a. Ridges 320 and 324<br>
extend across the upper portion of housing 69.<br>
[00116]    In FIG. 13, the opposite side of instrument 100 shown in FIG. 12 is illustrated<br>
showing pushbuttons 311b and 312b. Here the surgeon's forefinger is<br>
accessing rotation knob 29 to rotate end effector 81. As can be seen,<br>
pushbutton 312b is subject to inadvertent activation by the forefinger.<br>
However, ridge 324 causes the forefinger to elevate above the plane of<br>
pushbutton 312b thereby reducing the risk of inadvertent activation.<br>
[00117]    In FIG. 14, the surgeon has depressed trigger 34 to close clamp arm 56<br>
against blade 79, and the left thumb has easily accessed pushbutton 312b to<br>

[00119]    Referring to FIG. 17, an expression of surgical instrument 100 is shown<br>
graphically illustrating a surgeon's finger placement on instrument 100.<br>
Instrumental in the activation of the instrument 100 is the placement of the<br>
forefinger 382 and middle finger 384 on trigger 34. (Using the forefinger and<br>
middle finger to activate trigger 34 is exemplary only. Surgeons with smaller<br>
hands may opt to activate trigger 34 with the middle finger and ring finger,<br>
thereby making the forefinger available to rotate knob 29 or even use the ring<br>
finger and pinkie to active trigger 34.) Trigger 34 comprises a base element<br>
45, which comprises the detent tab 114 and linkage with yoke 33, discussed<br>
below. Attached to base element 45 is a generally T-shaped finger interface<br>
43 , which in conjunction with base element 45 define two generally U-shaped<br>
openings, a forefinger groove 42 and a middle finger groove 44. The most<br>
distal surface portion of T-shaped finger interface 43 defines an actuating<br>
surface 41 that also accepts placement of fingers 382 and 384. Grooves 42<br>
and 44 are sized to accept different sized fingers, a common variable as is<br>
evident depending upon the sex and size of the surgeon. In a first expression<br>
of the current embodiment, the size of grooves 42 and 44 are based on<br>
anthropic data for 5th percentile females through to 95th percentile males for<br>
finger size.  In a second expression of the current embodiment, grooves 42<br>
and 44 are tapered, whereby the dimension of each groove opening is larger<br>
than the dimension of base of each groove 42 and 44. This configuration<br>
advantageously allows fingers of varying size to nestle snuggly within each<br>
groove and minimize the clearance between the finger and walls of the<br>
grooves.<br>
[00120] Referring now also to FIGS. 10 and 11, the clamp arm 56 is fully open relative<br>
to the blade 79 when trigger 34 is in its most distal position (FIG. 10). Fingers<br>
382 and 384 may be placed within respective grooves 42 and 44 or<br>

alternatively on surface 41 to actuate trigger 34 through its arcuate travel<br>
designated by arrow 47. When trigger reaches its full proximal travel (when<br>
detent tab 114 engages detent spring 110), the clamp arm 56 is in its fully<br>
closed position relative to the blade 79 (FIG. 11). In order to reverse the<br>
trigger along its travel 47, fingers 382 and 384 engage grooves 42 and 44 and<br>
push trigger 34 distally to open the end effector. The clamp arm 56 is not<br>
biased open so the surgeon cannot control the opening of clamp arm 56 via<br>
surface 41.<br>
[00121]    Referring now to Fig. 18, elements having similar reference numerals as<br>
shown in Fig. 2 have the similar function as already discussed. Particular<br>
attention is directed to an alternate handle assembly 168 for actuating the end<br>
effector 81. The handle assembly 168 includes two pivoting handle portions<br>
420 and 422 coupled to a right shroud 169 and a left shroud 170.<br>
[00122]    The right shroud 169 is adapted to snap fit on the left shroud 170 via a<br>
plurality of inwardly facing prongs formed on the left shroud 170 to form<br>
housing 171. When the left shroud 170 is attached to the right shroud 169, a<br>
cavity is formed therebetween to accommodate various components that form<br>
the handle assembly 168 as further discussed below. Apertures 172 and 174<br>
are also formed to accommodate thumb ring or handle portion 420 and finger<br>
ring or handle portion 422, which are located exterior of the left and right<br>
shrouds to the actuating linkage contained within the left and right shrouds.<br>
Aperture 173 is also formed at the proximal end of shrouds to accommodate<br>
transducer 50 (See figure 8b).<br>
[00123]    Handle assembly 168 includes a U-shaped yoke 424 slidably attachable<br>
within housings 169 and 170 via slots 421a and 421b and pins 423a and<br>
423b, respectively.   The distal end of handle 420 at hole 402 attaches to right<br>
shroud 169 and yoke via pin 423a, and the proximal end of handle 420<br>
attaches to yoke 424 via link 428 attached to hole 404 via pin 426 and hole<br>
410 via pin 430. The distal end of handle 422 at hole 406 attaches to right<br>
shroud 169 and yoke via pin 423b, and the proximal end of handle 422<br>

attaches to yoke 424 via link 432 attached to hole 408 via pin 434 and hole<br>
412 via pin 430. In practice as the handles 420 and 422 are moved away<br>
from housing 171 (for example, the surgeon's thumb cooperates with handle<br>
420, and the surgeon's forefinger and middle finger cooperate with handle<br>
422), end effector 81 moves away from blade 79 to form an open jaw (the<br>
open position), and as handles 420 and 422 are moved toward housing 171,<br>
end effector 81 rotates toward blade 79 to capture tissue (the closed position).<br>
[00124]    In one expression of the current embodiment, a detent spring 482 is<br>
supported within housing portion 171. A detent cam 480 rotates on yoke 168<br>
and engages and snaps back detent spring 482 when handles 420 and 422<br>
are in the fully closed position. Detent spring 482 is generally made of a<br>
flexible plastic that adequately deflects when it engages cam 480 thereby<br>
providing an audible signal to the surgeon that there is full end effector 81<br>
closure. Advantageously, 480 strikes and deflects detent spring 482 when<br>
handles 420 and 422 are rotated from the full closure position and in the<br>
opposite direction thereby providing an audible signal to the surgeon that full<br>
closure of end effector 81 no longer exists.<br>
[00125]    Referring also now to Fig. 24, a second expression of the current embodiment<br>
is shown having an actuator post 433 attaches to handle 422 and engages a<br>
dome switch 435 covered by silicon rubber located on housing assembly 171.<br>
When handle 422 is fully closed, post 433 presses against the silicone which<br>
in turn transfers the force to the dome switch 435, allowing the switch to<br>
provide an audible and tactile feedback to the surgeon. In one embodiment<br>
post 433 is a cylinder having a diameter of 0.170 inches with a 0.070 inch slot<br>
in the middle. A preferred durometer for the silicon rubber material is 20<br>
Shore A.<br>
[00126]    Referring also now to Fig. 23, also enclosed within housing 171 are connector<br>
450, slip rings 452, 454, flex circuit 456 and rocker switch 462. Rocker switch<br>
462 rotatably attaches to right shroud 169 via aperture 469 and switches 462<br>
and 464 are positioned exterior housing 171 for access by the surgeonu.<br>

Switches 462 and 464 are mechanically connected via a rocker arm 466<br>
comprising a pivot post 468 which interfaces with aperture 469. In this<br>
configuration, switches 462 and 464 cannot be simultaneously depressed,<br>
which, if were the case, would provide an error message from generator 30.<br>
A flex circuit 456 provides for the electro-mechanical interface between<br>
switches 464 and 466 and the generator 30 via the transducer 50 (see Fig.<br>
8b). Referring to Fig. 21, flex circuit 456 includes, at the distal end, two dome<br>
switches 500 and 502 that are mechanically actuated by depressing<br>
corresponding switches 464 and 466, respectively. Dome switches 500 and<br>
502 are electrical contact switches, that when depressed provide an electrical<br>
signal to generator 30 as shown by the electrical wiring schematic of Fig. 22.<br>
Flex circuit 456 also comprises two diodes within a diode package 504, also<br>
illustrated in Fig. 22. Flex circuit 456 provides conductors, as is known to<br>
those in the art, that connect to slip ring conductors 452 and 454 via<br>
connector 450, which in turn provide electrical contact to ring conductors 400<br>
and 410 (Fig. 8b), which in turn are connected to conductors in cable 32 that<br>
connect to generator 30.<br>
[00127]    With particular reference now to Figs. 19 and 20a-b, slip ring conductors 452<br>
and 454 are generally open-ended O-shaped springs that slip onto mounting<br>
surfaces 453 and 455 of connector 450, respectively. Each spring slip-ring<br>
comprises two pressure point contacts (510a-b and 522a-b) that contact the<br>
respective ring conductor 400 and 410 of handpiece 50. The spring tension of<br>
the slip rings 452 and 454 cause positive contact between contacts 510a-b,<br>
522a-b and conductors 400 and 410. It is evident that the slip-ring<br>
construction allows electrical contact to be made even as hand piece 50 may<br>
be rotated by the surgeon during use of the instrument. Posts 512 and 524 of<br>
the respective slip rings electrically connect to the respective conductor within<br>
flex circuit 456 to complete the electrical circuit as shown in Fig. 22.<br>
[00128]    Referring again to Fig. 18, rotation coupler 130 rotatably engages the distal<br>
end of right and left shrouds 169 and 170. Rotation knob 129 couples to<br>

rotational coupler 130, whereby two spring tabs 175 and 175a (not shown)<br>
provide an outward tension or force against the inner surface of rotation knob<br>
129 to inhibit inadvertent rotation of end effector 81.<br>
[00129]    In an alternate expression of the invention, handles 420 and 422 have a soft-<br>
touch molded thermo plastic elastomer liner 550 on the inner surface of<br>
handles 420 and 422. Plastic liner 550 provides comfort to the surgeon and<br>
prevents finger and hand fatigue. Plastic liner 550 also provides an enhance<br>
gripping surface between the handles and the surgeon's thumb and fingers as<br>
opposed to the smooth plastic surface interface of the prior art. This is<br>
particularly advantageous for accepting multiple digit sizes of male and female<br>
surgeons and still providing a comfortable and positive gripping surface.<br>
Plastic liner 550 may be smooth or have contours molded onto the surface of<br>
liner 550, such as ribs, as illustrated in Figs. 23 and 24. Other contours may<br>
be bumps, and peaks and valleys. Various other shapes and interfaces are<br>
within the scope of this invention as would be obvious to one skilled in the art.<br>
Plastic liner 550 is also useful on the interface between the surgeon's finger<br>
and trigger 34 (Fig. 12).<br>
[00130]    In one expression of the current embodiment, the soft-touch liner 550 has a<br>
durometer (hardness) rating from about 35 Shore A to about 75 Shore A, and<br>
more particularly from about 50 Shore A to about 60 Shore A. Such<br>
appropriate materials are available from LNP of Exton, PA (stock no. 8211-55<br>
B100 GYO-826-3) and Advanced Elastomer Systems of Akron, OH (stock no.<br>
8211-55B100).<br>
[00131]    The soft-touch material may also be useful to help the surgeon identify a<br>
particular feature of the instrument while the surgeon is focused on the<br>
operation at hand. For example, a "soft touch" having one contour interface<br>
may be placed on the "max" button, and a "soft touch" having a second<br>
contour interface may be place on the "min" button so the surgeon may easily<br>
recognize the presence of either button without having to lose focus of the<br>

cutting, coagulation and clamping of tissue during surgical procedures. An elongated<br>
portion of the instrument can be configured for endoscopic applications and has an<br>
outside diameter of less than 6mm. The construction includes a clamping mechanism,<br>
including a clamp arm pivotally mounted at the distal portion of the instrument, which is<br>
specifically configured to create a desired level of tissue clamping forces, exceeding 4<br>
pounds when the trigger is fully closed. The clamping mechanism includes a two piece<br>
pad design and pad material that enables the higher tissue clamping forces and a force<br>
limiting mechanism that effectively smooth out abusive tissue forces. The assembly also<br>
features hand activation configured to provide an ergonomical grip and operation for<br>
the surgeon. Hand switches are placed in the range of the natural swing of the<br>
surgeon's thumb, whether gripping the surgical instrument right-handed or left handed.<br></td>
