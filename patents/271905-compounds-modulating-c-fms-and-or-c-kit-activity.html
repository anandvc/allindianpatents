FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] This invention relates to ligands for c-fms and c-kit, and to methods for use thereof. The<br>
information provided is intended solely to assist the understanding of the reader. None of the<br>
information provided nor references cited is admitted to be prior art to the present invention. Each<br>
of the references cited is incorporated herein in its entirety and for any purpose.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] C-fms and c-kit are both type III transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinases<br>
(RPTKs) that regulate key signal transduction cascades that control cellular growth and<br>
proliferation. Both receptors have similar structural features comprising five extracellular<br>
immunoglobulin (IG) domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a split cytoplasmic kinase<br>
domain separated by a kinase insert segment.<br><br><br>
c-Fms<br>
[00041 C-fms is a member of the family of genes originally isolated from the Susan McDonough<br>
strain of feline sarcoma viruses. The cellular proto-oncogene FMS (c-fms, gellular feline<br>
McDonough sarcoma) codes for the receptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-<br>
CSF). C-fms is crucial for the growth and differentiation of the monocyte-macrophage lineage,<br>
and upon binding of M-CSF to the extracellular domain of c-fms, the receptor dimerizes and trans-<br>
autophosphorylates cytoplasmic tyrosine residues.<br>
[0005] M-CSF, first described by Robinson and co-workers (Blood. 1969, 33:396-9), is a<br>
cytokine that controls the production, differentiation, and function of macrophages. M-CSF<br>
stimulates differentiation of progenitor cells to mature monocytes, and prolongs the survival of<br>
monocytes. Furthermore, M-CSF enhances cytotoxicity, superoxide production, phagocytosis,<br>
chemotaxis, and secondary cytokine production of additional factors in monocytes and<br>
macrophages. Examples of such additional factors include granulocyte colony stimulating factor<br>
(G-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8). M-CSF stimulates hematopoiesis,<br>
promotes differentiation and proliferation of osteoclast progenitor cells, and has profound effects<br>
on lipid metabolism. Furthermore, M-CSF is important in pregnancy. Physiologically, large<br>
amounts of M-CSF are produced in the placenta, and M-CSF is believed to play an essential role in<br>
trophoblast differentiation (Motoyoshi, Int J Hematol. 1998,67:109-22). The elevated serum<br>
levels of M-CSF in early pregnancy may participate in the immunologic mechanisms responsible<br>
for the maintenance of the pregnancy (Flanagan &amp; Lader, Curr Opin Hematol. 1998, 5:181-5).<br>
(0006] Related to c-fms and c-kit are two platelet-derived growth factor receptors, alpha (i.e.,<br>
pdgfra) and beta (pdgfrb) (PDGF). The gene coding for pdgfra is located on chromosome 4ql 1-<br>
ql2 in the same region of chromosome 4 as the oncogene coding for c-kit. The genes coding for<br>
pdgfra and c-fms appear to have evolved from a common ancestral gene by gene duplication,<br>
inasmuch as these two genes are tandemly linked on chromosome 5. They are oriented head-to-<br>
tail with the 5-prime exon of the c-fms gene located only 500 bp from the last 3-prime exon of the<br>
gene coding for pdgfra. Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) have activating mutations in<br>
c-kit, and most patients with GISTs respond well to Gleevec, which inhibits c-kit. Heinrich et al.<br>
(Science 2003, 299:708-10) have shown that approximately 35% of GISTs lacking c-kit mutations<br>
have intragenic activation mutations in the gene encoding pdgfra, and that tumors expressing c-kit<br>
or pdgfra are indistinguishable with respect to activation of downstream signaling intermediates<br>
and cytogenetic changes associated with tumor progression. Thus, c-kit and pdgfra mutations<br>
appear to be alternative and mutually exclusive oncogenic mechanisms in GISTs.<br><br>
10007] Similarly, the observation that production of M-CSF, the major macrophage growth<br>
factor, is increased in tissues during inflammation points out a role for c-fms in diseases, such as<br>
for example inflammatory diseases. More particularly, because elevated levels of M-CSF are<br>
found in the disease state, modulation of the activity of c-fms can ameliorate disease associated<br>
with increased levels of M-CSF.<br>
c-Kit<br>
[0008] The Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor c-kit plays an important role in the development of<br>
mclanocytes and mast, germ and hematopoietic cells. Stem Cell Factor (SCF) is a protein encoded<br>
by the S1 locus, and has also been called "kit ligand" (KL) and mast cell growth factor (MGF),<br>
based on the biological properties used to identify it (reviewed in Tsujimura, Pathol Int 1996,<br>
46:933-938; Loveland, et al., J. Endocrinol 1997, 153:337-344; Vliagoftis, et al., Clin Immunol<br>
1997, 100:435-440; Broudy, Blood 1997, 90:1345-1364; Pignon, Hermatol Cell Ther 1997,<br>
39:114-116; and Lyman, et al., Blood 1998, 91:1101-1134.). Herein the abbreviation SCF refers<br>
to the physiological ligand for c-kit.<br>
[0009] SCF is synthesized as a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of 220 or 248<br>
Dalton, depending on alternative splicing of the mRNA to encode exon 6. The larger protein can<br>
be proteolytically cleaved to form a soluble, glycosylated protein which noncovalently dimerizes.<br>
Both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of SCF can bind to and activate c-kit. For example,<br>
in the skin, SCF is predominantly expressed by fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells,<br>
which modulate the activity of melanocytes and mast cells expressing c-kit. In bone, marrow<br>
stromal cells express SCF and regulate hematopoiesis of c-kit expressing stem cells. In the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, intestinal epithelial cells express SCF and affect the interstitial cells of Cajal<br>
and intraepithelial lymphocytes. In the testis, sertoli cells and granulosa cells express SCF which<br>
regulates spermatogenesis by interaction with c-kit on germ cells.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The present invention relates to compounds active on c-fms, c-kit, or both c-fms and c-<br>
kit. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, it has been discovered that in the<br>
treatment of diseases amenable to treatment by an effective amount of a modulator of either c-fms<br>
alone or c-kit alone, the efficacy of treatment can be enhanced if said compounds are dual<br>
inhibitors of both c-fms and c-kit. In another aspect of the present invention, compounds active on<br>
c-fms, c-kit, or both c-fms and c-kit are also active on one or more of TrkA, TrkB and HGK. In<br>
particular, the invention provides compounds of Formula II, and all sub-generic formulae thereof<br><br>
(e.g. Formula IIa, IIb, He, IIg and IIp), Fonnula III, or additional compounds as described in the<br>
synthetic examples, as well as methods of using such compounds as described below. Thus, the<br>
invention provides methods of using compounds that can be used therapeutically and/or<br>
prophylactically involving modulation of c-fms, c-kit, or both c-fms and c-kit, or involving one or<br>
more of TrkA, TrkB and HGK in addition to c-fms, c-kit, or both c-fms and c-kit.<br><br>

[0068] Additional aspects and embodiments will be apparent from the following Detailed<br>
Description and from the claims.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0069] As used herein the following definitions apply:<br>

[0073] "Lower alkyl" alone or in combination means an alkane-derived radical containing from<br>
1 to 6 carbon atoms (unless specifically defined) that includes a straight chain alkyl or branched<br>
alkyl. The straight chain or branched alkyl group is attached at any available point to produce a<br>
stable compound. In many embodiments, a lower alkyl is a straight or branched alkyl group<br>
containing from 1-6, 1-4, or 1-2, carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-<br>

where preferably the lower alkyl is substituted with 1,2, 3,4 or 5 fluoro atoms, also 1,2, or 3<br>
fluoro atoms. While it is understood that substitutions are attached at any available atom to<br>
produce a stable compound, when optionally substituted alkyl is an R group of a moiety such as -<br>
OR, -NHR, -C(O)NHR, and the like, substitution of the alkyl R group is such that substitution of<br>
the alkyl carbon bound to any -O-, -S-, or -N- of the moiety (except where -N- is a heteroaryl ring<br>
atom) excludes substituents that would result in any -O-, -S-, or -N- of the substituent (except<br>
where -N- is a heteroaryl ring atom) being bound to the alkyl carbon bound to any -O-, -S-, or -N-<br>
of the moiety.<br>
[0074] "Cycloalkyl" refers to saturated or unsaturated, non-aromatic monocyclic, bicyclic or<br>
tricyclic carbon ring systems of 3-10, also 3-8, more preferably 3-6, ring members per ring, such as<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, adamantyl, and the like. A "substituted cycloalkyl" is a<br>
cycloalkyl that is independently substituted, with one or more, preferably 1,2, 3,4 or 5, also 1,2,<br>

Heterocycloalkyl is also intended to include oxidized S or N, such as sulfinyl, sulfonyl and N-<br>
oxide of a tertiary ring nitrogen. Heterocycloalkyl is also intended to include compounds in which<br>
one of the ring carbons is oxo substituted, i.e. the ring carbon is a carbonyl group, such as lactones<br>
and lactams. The point of attachment of the heterocycloalkyl ring is at a carbon or nitrogen atom<br>
such that a stable ring is retained. Examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, morpholino, tetrahydrofuranyl, dihydropyridinyl, piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolidonyl,<br>
piperazinyl, dihydrobenzofuryl, and dihydroindolyl. A "substituted heterocycloalkyl" is a<br>
heterocycloalkyl that is independently substituted, with one or more, preferably 1, 2, 3,4 or 5, also<br>
1, 2, or 3 substituents, attached at any available atom to produce a stable compound.<br>
[0076| "Aryl" alone or in combination refers to a monocyclic or bicyclic ring system containing<br>

more, preferably 1-4, more preferably 1-3, even more preferably 1-2, heteroatoms independently<br>
selected from the group consisting of O, S, and N. Heteroaryl is also intended to include oxidized<br>
S or N, such as sulfinyl, sulfonyl and N-oxide of a tertiary ring nitrogen. A carbon or nitrogen<br>
atom is the point of attachment of the heteroaryl ring structure such that a stable compound is<br>
produced. Examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl,<br>
pyrazinyl, quinaoxalyl, indolizinyl, benzo[b]thienyl, quinazolinyl, purinyl, indolyl, quinolinyl,<br>

alkoxy" denotes lower alkoxy in which R1 is lower alkyl substituted with one or more substituents<br>
as indicated herein attached at any available atom to produce a stable compound. Preferably,<br>
substitution of lower alkoxy is with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 substituents, also 1, 2, or 3 substituents. For<br>
example "fluoro substituted lower alkoxy" denotes lower alkoxy in which the lower alkyl is<br>
substituted with one or more fluoro atoms, where preferably the lower alkoxy is substituted with 1,<br>
2, 3, 4 or 5 fluoro atoms, also 1, 2, or 3 fluoro atoms. While it is understood that substitutions on<br><br><br>
alkoxy are attached at any available atom to produce a stable compound, substitution of alkoxy is<br>
such that -O-, -S-, or -N- (except where N is a heteroaryl ring atom), are not bound to the alkyl<br>
carbon bound to the alkoxy -O-. Further, where alkoxy is described as a substituent of another<br>
moiety, the alkoxy oxygen is not bound to a carbon atom that is bound to an -O-, -S-, or -N- of the<br>
other moiety (except where N is a heteroaryl ring atom), or to an alkene or alkyne carbon of the<br>
other moiety.<br>
[0079] "Lower alkylthio" denotes the group -SR", where R" is lower alkyl. "Substituted lower<br>
alkylthio" denotes lower alkylthio in which R" is lower alkyl substituted with one or more<br>

Preferably, substitution of lower alkylthio is with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 substituents, also 1, 2, or 3<br>
substituents. For example "fluoro substituted lower alkylthio" denotes lower alkylthio in which<br>
the lower alkyl is substituted with one or more fluoro atoms, where preferably the lower alkylthio<br>
is substituted with 1, 2,3,4 or 5 fluoro atoms, also 1,2, or 3 fluoro atoms. While it is understood<br>
that substitutions on alkylthio are attached at any available atom to produce a stable compound,<br>
substitution of alkylthio is such that -O-, -S-, or -N- (except where N is a heteroaryl ring atom),<br>
are not bound to the alkyl carbon bound to the alkylthio -S-. Further, where alkylthio is described<br>
as a substituent of another moiety, the alkylthio sulfur is not bound to a carbon atom that is bound<br>
to an -O-, -S-, or -N- of the other moiety (except where N is a heteroaryl ring atom), or to an<br>
alkene or alkyne carbon of the other moiety.<br>
[0080] "Mono-alkylamino" denotes the group -NHRbb where Rbb is lower alkyl. "Di-<br>
alkylamino" denotes the group -NR^60, where R1* and RM are independently lower alkyl.<br>
"Cycloalkylamino" denotes the group -NR^R™, where R*1 and R" combine with the nitrogen to<br>
form a 5-7 membered heterocycloalkyl, where the heterocycloalkyl may contain an additional<br>
heteroatom within the ring, such as -O-, -N-, or -S-, and may also be further substituted with<br>
lower alkyl. Examples of 5-7 membered heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to,<br>
piperidine, piperazine, 4-methylpiperazine, morpholine, and thiomorpholine. While it is<br>
understood that when mono-alkylamino, di-alkylamino, or cycloalkylamino are substituents on<br>
other moieties that are attached at any available atom to produce a stable compound, the nitrogen<br>
of mono-alkylamino, di-alkylamino, or cycloalkylamino as substituents is not bound to a carbon<br>
atom that is bound to an -O-, -S-, or -N- of the other moiety.<br>
[0081] As used herein, the term c-kit-mediated disease or condition refers to a disease or<br>
condition in which the biological function of c-kit affects the development and/or course of the<br>
disease or condition, and/or in which modulation of c-kit alters the development, course, and/or<br>
symptoms. For example, mutations in the c-kit gene such as the W42, Wv, and W41 mutations<br><br><br>
reported by Herbst et al al (J. Biol. Chem., 1992,267: 13210-13216) confer severe, intermediate,<br>
and mild phcnotypic characteristics, respectively. These mutations attenuate the intrinsic tyrosine<br>
kinase activity of the receptor to different degrees and are models for the effect of modulation of<br>
c-kit activity. A c-kit mediated disease or condition includes a disease or condition for which c-kit<br>
inhibition provides a therapeutic benefit, e.g. wherein treatment with c-kit inhibitors, including<br>
compounds described herein, provides a therapeutic benefit to the subject suffering from or at risk<br>
of the disease or condition.<br>
[0082] As used herein, the term c-fms-mediated disease or condition refers to a disease or<br>
condition in which the biological function of c-fms affects the development and/or course of the<br>
disease or condition, and/or in which modulation of c-fms alters the development, course, and/or<br>
symptoms. For example, the Csflr/Csflr mutant mouse of Dai et al (Blood, 2002, 99: 111-120)<br>
which lacks c-fms is an animal model for diseases or conditions wherein c-fms activity has been<br>
abolished. A c-fms mediated disease or condition includes a disease or condition for which c-fms<br>
inhibition provides a therapeutic benefit, e.g. wherein treatment with c-fms inhibitors, including<br>
compounds described herein, provides a therapeutic benefit to the subject suffering from or at risk<br>
of the disease or condition.<br>
[0083] As used herein, the term "composition" refers to a formulation suitable for administration<br>
to an intended animal subject for therapeutic purposes that contains at least one pharmaceutically<br>
active compound and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
[0084] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" indicates that the indicated material does not<br>
have properties that would cause a reasonably prudent medical practitioner to avoid administration<br>
of the material to a patient, taking into consideration the disease or conditions to be treated and the<br>
respective route of administration. For example, it is commonly required that such a material be<br>
essentially sterile, e.g., for injectibles.<br>
[0085] In the present context, the terms "therapeutically effective" and "effective amount"<br>
indicate that the materials or amount of material is effective to prevent, alleviate, or ameliorate one<br>
or more symptoms of a disease or medical condition, and/or to prolong the survival of the subject<br>
being treated.<br>
|0086] As used herein, the term "modulating" or "modulate" refers to an effect of altering a<br>
biological activity, especially a biological activity associated with a particular biomolecule such as<br>
c-kit or c-fms. For example, an agonist or antagonist of a particular biomolecule modulates the<br>
activity of that biomolecule, e.g., an enzyme.<br><br><br>
[0087] The term "c-kit activity" refers to a biological activity of c-kit, particularly including<br>
kinase activity. The term "c-fms activity" refers to a biological activity of c-fms, particularly<br>
including kinase activity.<br>
I. General<br>

IIp or III and all sub-embodiments thereof, that are inhibitors of c-kit, c-fms, or both c-kit and<br>
c-fms, and the use of the compounds in treating diseases that are mediated by c-kit, c-fms, or both<br>
c-kit and c-fms.<br>
Exemplary Diseases Associated with c-Kit.<br>
[0089] The compounds described herein are useful for treating disorders related to c-kit e.g.,<br>

invention. For example, the ability of osteoclast precursor cells (commercially available from<br>

presence of compounds, can be measured using a method analogous to that previously reported<br>
(Hudson et al., Journal of Urology, 1947, 58:89-92), where the amount of acid phosphatase in the<br>
supernatant (i.e. TRAP5b excreted by mature osteoclasts) is proportional to the number of mature<br>
osteoclasts present. In another example, the ability of M-CSF-dependent murine macrophage cells<br>
(BAC1.2F5) to proliferate in the presence of compounds can be measured by culturing cells as<br>
