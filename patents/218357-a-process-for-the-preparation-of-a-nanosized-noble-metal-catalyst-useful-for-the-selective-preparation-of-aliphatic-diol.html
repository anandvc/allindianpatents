				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A NANOSIZED NOBLE METAL CATALYST USEFUL FOR THE SELECTIVE PREPARATION OF ALIPHATIC DIOLS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a nanosized noble metal catalyst. More particularly, it relates to the said catalyst composition in the form of a colloidal dispersion which is useful for selective hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol to 1,4 butenediol. The catalyst is a noble metal e.g. palladium or platinum in the form of colloidal dispersion where the particle size of the catalysts is less than 75 run.<br>
PRIOR ART REFERENCES<br>
In the prior art, the uses of a number of catalysts are described for producing 1,4<br>
butenediol by hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol.   Most of these patents are based on the<br>
combination of palladium with one or more mixed compounds of copper, zinc, calcium,<br>
cadmium, lead, alumina, mercury, tellurium, gallium etc.  Selective hydrogenation of<br>
         acetylinic compound is described in GBA 871,804 in a suspension method using Pd<br>
	catalyst which has been treated with the salt solutions of Zn, Cd, Hg, Ga, Th, In, or Ga.<br>
The process is carried out at milder conditions with 97% selectivity for cis 1,2-butenediol and 3% to the trans form. Moreover, use of organic amines has been suggested as promoters in the catalyst system.<br>
Lindlar catalyst (lead doped Pd catalyst) is also used for the selective hydrogenation of the acetylinic compounds as described inJJS Patent No. 2,681,938. The drawback of this process is use of additional amines such as pyridine to obtain good selectivity for 1,4 butenediol.<br>
Yet another DE patent (DE 1,213,839) describes Pd catalyst doped with Zn salts and<br>
ammonia for the partial hydrogenation of acetylinic compounds. But this catalyst suffers from a major drawback of short lifetime due to poisoning.<br>
The use of Pd/A^Ch catalyst, which has been treated with carbon monoxide for the hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol in an inert solvent, is described in DE-A 2,619,660. The disadvantage of this process is that the catalyst is treated with carbon monoxide gas, which is highly toxic and difficult to handle.<br><br>
US Patent No.2, 961,471 describe Raney nickel catalyst for partial hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol using Raney nickel catalyst. This catalyst gave a low selectivity for 1,4 butenediol. In another, US Patent Na 2 953,604 is described a Pd containing charcoal and copper catalyst for the reduction of 1,4 butynediol to 1,4 butenediol with 81% selectivity for 1,4 butenediol. The drawback of the process is the formation of large A/ - \J/ amount of side products. Another US Patent No. 4,001,344_d&gt;escribes a catalyst for the<br>
\	<br>
     preparation of 1,4 butenediol by hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol by use of palladium<br>
 mixed with y-Al2O3  along with, zinc and cadmium or either zinc or cadmium together JT     .	with bismuth or tellurium. The disadvantage of the said process is the formation of large<br>
 amount of residues (7.5-12%) which lowers the selectivity of 1,4 butenediol to 88%.<br>
In addition to these patents, US Patent Nos. 5,521,139 and 5,728,900 describes the<br>
catalyst and a process for the preparation of 1,4 butenediol by the hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol over a Pd containing catalyst. They have used the fixed bed catalyst, which was prepared by applying Pd and Pb or Pd and Cd successively, by vapor deposition or sputtering, to metal gauze or a metal foil acting as a support. In this process also selectivity obtained for cis 1,4 butenediol is 98%. The disadvantage of these processes is that a trans 1,4 butenediol with residues are also obtained.<br>
All the above said catalysts for the hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol to 1,4 butenediol suffers from the disadvantages such as used promoters like organic amines. Their preparation becomes cumbersome and involves use of sophisticated equipment. All these catalysts reported do not give complete selectivity to the desired product 1,4 butenediol.<br>
The formation of side products and residues has also been reported which affect the efficiency of the process and the recovery of pure 1,4 butenediol is difficult. Also these catalysts suffer from short life due to fast deactivation.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel nanosized noble metal catalyst for selective preparation of aliphatic diols.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel nanosized noble metal catalyst for selective hydrogenation of 1,4 butynediol to 1,4 butenediol.<br>
