THIS INVENTION relates to a fixed bed coal gasifier and to a method of<br>
operating a fixed bed coal gasifier.<br>
Fixed bed coal gasifiers, such as fixed bed dry bottom gasifiers, are also<br>
known as moving bed gasifiers or moving bed dry ash gasifiers.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a fixed bed coal<br>
gasifier, which includes<br>
a normally upright cylindrical wall defining a coal gasification chamber in which<br>
coal, in the form of a fixed coal bed, can be gasified to produce synthesis gas as well as<br>
ash in an ash bed below the coal bed;<br>
a coal lock above the chamber, the coal lock having a more-or-less centrally located<br>
coal discharge opening which is in communication with the coal gasification chamber and<br>
a displaceable closure member for closing off the coal discharge opening, the closure<br>
member being displaceable between a closed position in which it closes off the coal<br>
discharge opening and an open position in which the coal discharge opening is uncovered<br>
or open so that coal can pass under gravity from the coal lock through the coal discharge<br>
opening into the coal gasification chamber;<br>
a static coal distribution device inside the coal gasification chamber, the static coal<br>
distribution device including a hollow coal distributor having an upper open end spaced<br>
from the coal discharge opening and which flares downwardly outwardly from its upper<br>
end to a lower open end thereof and with no static coal distribution device being provided<br>
between the upper end of the coal distributor and the coal discharge opening, apart<br>
possibly from the closure member; a skirt depending downwardly from the inside of the<br>
coal distributor so that a gas collection zone is defined between the skirt and the coal<br>
distributor, with the top of the gas collection zone being closed off while the bottom<br>
thereof is in communication with the coal gasification chamber; and at least one gas outlet<br>
in the coal distributor, with the gas outlet being in communication with the gas collection<br>
zone, a first coal passageway thus being defined between the coal distributor and the<br>
cylindrical wall while a second coal passageway is provided along the inside of the skirt;<br>
a gas withdrawal conduit leading from the gas outlet of the coal distribution device;<br>
an ash discharge outlet leading from the chamber at a low level; and<br><br><br>
a rotatable grate above the ash discharge outlet, the rotatable grate including at least<br>
one upwardly projecting finger or disturbing formation to disturb the ash bed formed in<br>
use above and around the rotatable grate, when the rotatable grate is rotated.<br>
Typically, the gasifier includes an ash lock in communication with the ash<br>
discharge outlet.<br>
The closure member of the coal lock may be displaceable vertically, with its<br>
closed position being an upper position and its open position being a lower position. Thus,<br>
the upper open end of the coal distributor may be located with sufficient clearance from<br>
the coal lock closure member when it is in its lower open position so that coal can pass<br>
between the coal lock closure member and the upper end of the coal distributor.<br>
The rotatable grate typically has a vertical dimension and a radial direction and<br>
is rotatable about a vertical axis of the ash discharge outlet, with a lower periphery of the<br>
rotatable grate being below an apex or upper end of the rotatable grate. The finger<br>
formation is typically spaced from the axis of rotation of the rotatable grate and preferably<br>
projects upwardly to approximately the same height or slightly below the apex or upper<br>
end of the rotatable grate.<br>
The rotatable grate may have an upwardly inwardly tapering outer surface.<br>
The upwardly inwardly tapering outer surface may be staggered or stepped when seen in<br>
vertical cross-section, defining vertically and radially spaced terraces. Preferably, the<br>
finger formation is located on the lowermost outermost terrace, with a height which is at a<br>
level more-or-less equal to the uppermost innermost terrace.<br>
The upwardly inwardly tapering outer surface of the rotatable grate may be<br>
defined by a rotatable grate component. The gasifier may thus include<br>
said rotatable grate component (which is hereinafter referred to as the only rotatable<br>
grate component) in the coal gasification chamber, with a first annular portion of an ash<br>
discharge passageway being provided between the wall of the gasification chamber and<br>
the rotatable grate component, with the grate component being rotatable about the vertical<br>
axis of the ash discharge passageway, and with the grate component being adapted so that<br><br><br>
clinker crushing is, in use, effected in the first annular portion of the ash discharge<br>
passageway as the grate component rotates;<br>
a stationary support component at a lower end of the first annular portion of the ash<br>
discharge passageway, the stationary support component providing or defining an ash<br>
collection surface; and<br>
at least one primary scraper adapted to urge ash on the ash collection surface of the<br>
support component inwardly or outwardly along a second portion of the ash discharge<br>
passageway, as the grate component rotates, with the ash discharge passageway being<br>
adjacent a floor of the gasification chamber.<br>
Instead, the upwardly inwardly tapering outer surface of the rotatable grate<br>
may be defined by a first rotatable grate component. The gasifier may thus include<br>
said first rotatable grate component in the coal gasification chamber, with a first<br>
annular portion of a first ash discharge passageway being provided between the wall of the<br>
gasification chamber and the first grate component, with the first grate component being<br>
rotatable about the vertical axis of the first ash discharge passageway, and with the first<br>
grate component being adapted so that clinker crushing is, in use, effected in the first<br>
annular portion of the first ash discharge passageway as the first grate component rotates;<br>
a stationary support component at a lower end of the first annular portion of the first<br>
ash discharge passageway, the stationary support component providing or defining an ash<br>
collection surface;<br>
at least one primary scraper adapted to urge ash on the ash collection surface of the<br>
support component inwardly or outwardly along a second portion of the first ash discharge<br>
passageway, as the first grate component rotates, with the first ash discharge passageway<br>
being adjacent a floor of the gasification chamber; and<br>
a second centrally located stationary grate component, with a second ash discharge<br>
passageway being provided between the first and second grate components and being<br>
located adjacent the floor, with the first grate component being rotatable around the<br>
second grate component, and with the first and second grate components being adapted so<br>
that the clinker crushing is, in use, effected in a first annular portion of the second gas<br>
discharge passageway as the first grate component rotates.<br><br><br>
The gasifier may be a low temperature dry ash moving bed gasifier, similar to<br>
a Lurgi (trade name) dry ash moving bed gasifier, in which the ash discharge means is in<br>
the form of a circular (when seen in plan view) grate mounted to rotate above the ash<br>
discharge outlet, and in which the ash discharge outlet is of annular form.<br>
The second ash discharge passageway, when present, is thus also at least partly<br>
of annular form, and at least a portion thereof is located concentrically within at least a<br>
portion of the first passageway, when seen in plan view. The portions of the first ash<br>
discharge passageway may be located at different levels, as may be portions of the second<br>
ash discharge passageway. Additionally, at least a portion of the first ash discharge<br>
passageway may be located at a different level to at least a portion of the second ash<br>
discharge passageway.<br>
The stationary support component thus provides an upwardly directed ash<br>
collection surface, and it may protrude radially inwardly from the wall. Said at least one<br>
outer or primary plough or scraper thus protrudes from the only or first discharge or grate<br>
component and is adapted to direct ash inwardly along the collection surface as the only or<br>
first discharge or grate component rotates.<br>
The second passageway, when present, may comprise a more-or-less annular first<br>
portion, a second portion extending radially outwardly from the lower end of the first portion,<br>
and a third annular portion in communication with the second portion. The second stationary<br>
central discharge or grate component, when present, may comprise a central pillar and at least<br>
one stationary inner or secondary plough protruding outwardly from the pillar into the second<br>
portion of the passageway. When the second grate component is not present, the gasifier<br>
may still include a central pillar, although typically a shorter one.<br>
The first rotatable grate component and the second stationary central grate<br>
component thus together constitute a grate.<br>
A plurality of the primary or outer ploughs, staggered or spaced apart about the<br>
rotational axis of the only or first grate component, may be provided. Similarly, a plurality of<br><br><br>
the stationary secondary or inner ploughs, staggered or spaced apart about the pillar, when<br>
present as part of the second grate component, may be provided.<br>
The central pillar may include a gasification agent passageway, extending along<br>
its length, with the lower end of the passageway being open at the lower end of the pillar and<br>
being connected, by means of a conduit, to a supply of the gasification agent. The<br>
gasification agent passageway has one or more gasification agent outlets. When the gasifier<br>
includes said second grate component, the central pillar may include at least one gasification<br>
agent outlet at or in proximity to the upper end of the pillar protruding into the gasification<br>
chamber, with this outlet being in communication with the first portion of the second<br>
passageway; and at least one further gasification agent outlet in the pillar between its ends,<br>
the further outlet being in communication with the first passageway. Preferably, however,<br>
there is no gasification outlet at or in proximity to the upper end of the pillar.<br>
The first or only grate component may comprise a hollow support structure<br>
rotatable about the pillar, with the further gasification agent outlet, or a gasification agent<br>
outlet, in the pillar being in communication with the hollow interior of the first or only grate<br>
component; an outer shield covering at least a portion of the support structure; and at least<br>
one gasification outlet in or adjacent the outer shield, for discharging gasification agent from<br>
the inside of the support structure into the gasification chamber as the first or only grate<br>
component rotates about the pillar. The outer surface of the outer shield of the first or only<br>
grate component may taper upwardly inwardly from the outer ploughs. The angle which the<br>
outer surface forms with the horizontal may be greater than the angle of repose of coal ash.<br>
In particular, the outer surface of the first or only grate component may be<br>
staggered or stepped when seen in vertical cross-section, with each step or layer comprising a<br>
plurality of outer shield plates arranged circumferentially in abutting or overlapping<br>
relationship and sloping upwardly inwardly. The different layers of shield plates thus<br>
together constitute the outer shield. A circumferential gasification agent opening or outlet<br>
may then be provided at each step or layer such that gasification agent passes underneath the<br>
lower edges of the outer shield plates of each step or layer.<br><br><br>
The rotatable grate may include four circumferential gasification agent outlets<br>
which are vertically and radially spaced, ranging from a highest, radially innermost to a<br>
lowest, radially outermost gasification agent outlet and including a second highest and a third<br>
highest outlet.<br>
The gasification agent outlets may be dimensioned to gasification agent at<br>
a common supply pressure in the following proportions:<br>
Lowermost, radially outermost: 30 % to 50 % <br>
Third highest: 20% to 40% <br>
Second highest: 10 % to 30 % <br>
Highest, radially innermost: 5 % to 15 %<br>
Breaker ribs may be provided on portions of the pillar and the first grate<br>
component which define between them the first annular portion of the second discharge<br>
passageway with the clinker crushing in the first annular portion of the second ash discharge<br>
passageway being effected between the breaker ribs.<br>
The coal discharge opening of the coal lock may be circular, and the coal lock<br>
closure member may thus be circular in plan view. Thus, the closure may typically be of<br>
disc-like form.<br>
The hollow coal distributor may have a substantially frusto-conical form and may<br>
be open ended so that it has a smaller circular opening and a larger circular opening. Its<br>
smaller opening will thus constitute its upper end, while its larger opening will constitute its<br>
lower end. The openings of the coal distributor may be aligned with the coal discharge<br>
opening of the coal lock. The cone angle of the coal distributor will be such as to inhibit<br>
bridging and to facilitate mass flow of coal over the coal distributor. Thus, typically, the<br>
angle of inclination of at least a major portion of the coal distributor is about 60 ° to the<br>
horizontal.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the diameter of the smaller opening of the<br>
coal distributor may be greater than that of the coal lock coal discharge opening. The upper<br><br><br>
end of the skirt may then be located in proximity to the smaller opening of the coal<br>
distributor. The ratio of the diameter of the smaller opening to that of the larger opening of<br>
the coal distributor is then typically about 1 :2.<br>
However, in another embodiment of the invention, the diameter of the smaller<br>
opening of the coal distributor may be about the same as that of the coal lock coal discharge<br>
opening. The upper end of the skirt may then be located about midway between the upper<br>
and lower ends of the coal distributor. The ratio of the diameter of the smaller opening to that<br>
of the larger opening of the coal distributor may then typically be about 1 : 6.<br>
The skirt may be of substantially cylindrical form. A lower end portion of the<br>
skirt may protrude from the lower end of the coal distributor so that the lower end of the skirt<br>
is located at a lower level than the lower end of the coal distributor.<br>
The gasifier may include a second skirt around the other or first skirt and spaced<br>
therefrom. The upper end of the second skirt may depend from the inside of the coal<br>
distributor, and its lower end may be located at a lower level than the lower end of the coal<br>
distributor. The second skirt may taper downwardly inwardly so that it is of inverted open<br>
ended hollow frusto-conical form.<br>
The gasifier may include a plurality of inwardly directed circumferentially<br>
spaced coal distribution ribs on the cylindrical wall at about the level of the lower end of the<br>
coal distributor, with the ribs adapted to distribute coal away from the inner surface of the<br>
wall. Each rib may include an upper coal deflection surface which slopes downwardly away<br>
from the wall and which, in use, serves to distribute coal downwardly away from the inner<br>
surface of the wall.<br>
The heights of the coal distributor and the skirts are such that their lower ends<br>
will, in use, be located below the normal coal bed level in the gasification chamber.<br>
The coal distribution device may be attached to the cylindrical wall. The wall<br>
may comprise outer and inner skins spaced apart so that a cavity is provided between them,<br><br><br>
with the cavity normally containing water so that the inner skin and the water-filled cavity<br>
constitute a water jacket along the inside of the outer skin.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
operating a fixed bed coal gasifier in accordance with the first aspect of the invention, the<br>
method including <br>
feeding coal into the coal gasification chamber through the coal lock and distributing<br>
the coal inside the coal gasification chamber by means of said coal distribution device to<br>
form a fixed coal bed;<br>
feeding a gasification agent into the gasification chamber;<br>
gasifying the coal in the gasification chamber to produce synthesis gas as well as ash in<br>
an ash bed below the coal bed; and<br>
rotating said rotatable grate to remove ash through the ash discharge outlet and to<br>
disturb the ash bed with said at least one finger or disturbing formation.<br>
The rotatable grate may include a first grate component, or an only grate<br>
component, as hereinbefore described, and in particular a first grate component, or an only<br>
grate component, which has an outer surface which is staggered or stepped in vertical cross-<br>
section, with a circumferential gasification agent outlet being provided at at least some steps<br>
or layers, typically at each step or layer, the gasification agent outlets thus being vertically<br>
and radially spaced. The method may include feeding the gasification agent into the<br>
gasification chamber through the circumferential gasification agent outlets, preferably at each<br>
step or layer, including a bottom radially outermost gasification agent outlet on the bottom<br>
radially outermost step or layer. The gasification agent may be fed in proportion to the radial<br>
position of a gasification agent outlet. Thus, the radially outermost gasification agent outlet<br>
may feed the most gasification agent and a radially innermost gasification agent outlet may<br>
feed the least of the gasification agent.<br>
Typically, no gasification agent is fed through said upper end of the central pillar.<br>
The rotatable grate may include four circumferential gasification agent outlets<br>
which are vertically and radially spaced, ranging from a highest, radially innermost to said<br>
lowest, radially outermost gasification agent outlet and including a second highest and a third<br><br><br>
highest outlet. The gasification agent may be fed through the outlets in the following<br>
proportions:<br>
Lowermost, radially outermost: 30 % to 50 %	<br>
Third highest: 20 % to 40 %<br>
Second highest: 10 % to 30 %<br>
Highest, radially innermost: 5 % to 15 %<br>
Preferably, the gasification agent is fed through the outlets in the following<br>
proportions:<br>
Lowermost, radially outermost: 35 % to 45 % <br>
Third highest: 25 % to 35 %<br>
Second highest: 15 % to 25 %<br>
Highest, radially innermost: 5 % to 15 %<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the<br>
accompanying diagrammatic drawings.<br>

with portions omitted for clarity; and<br>
FIGURE 9 shows a vertical sectional view of part of the fixed bed coal gasifier of<br>
Figure 1 or Figure 5, with a different grate.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 4, reference numeral 300 generally indicates a fixed bed<br>
Lurgi (trademark) coal gasifier according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
The gasifier 300 includes an upright circular cylindrical wall, generally indicated<br>
by reference numeral 312. The wall 312 comprises an outer skin 314, and an inner skin 316<br>
spaced from the outer skin 314 so that a cavity 318 is defined between the skins 314, 316.<br>
The cavity 318 normally contains water. In other words, the skin 316 and the water filled<br>
cavity 318 constitute a water jacket along the inside of the outer skin 314. The wall 312<br>
defines a coal gasification chamber, generally indicated by reference numeral 320.<br>
The wall 312 is closed off, at its upper end, by means of an ellipsoidal head,<br>
generally indicated by reference numeral 322. The head 322 is also of double skin<br>
construction, and thus also has an outer skin 314, an inner skin 316 and a water cavity 318<br>
which is thus an extension of the cavity 318 of the wall 312. A flanged circular connection<br>
324, defining a circular opening, is provided at the centre of the head 322.<br>
A flanged connection 326, providing a gas outlet passageway 328, is provided in<br>
the wall 312 at a high level, i.e. near the upper end of the gasifier 300.<br>
The gasifier 300 also includes a coal lock, generally indicated by reference<br>
numeral 330, located above the head 322. The coal lock 330 is shown in part only and<br>
includes a lower flanged connection 332 which is connected to the flanged connection 324.<br>
The coal lock 330 includes a component 334 which defines a centrally located<br>
coal discharge opening 336 which is in communication with the gasification chamber 320. A<br>
circular disc-like closure member 338 closes off the discharge opening 336. An actuating rod<br>
340 protrudes upwardly from the closure member 338. By means of the rod 340, the closure<br>
member 338 is displaceable from an upper closed position (as shown in full line in Figure 1)<br><br><br>
in which it closes off the coal discharge opening 336, to a lower open position (as shown in<br>
broken line in Figure 1) in which the coal discharge opening 336 is uncovered so that coal<br>
can pass under gravity from the coal lock 330 through the opening 336 into the coal<br>
gasification chamber 320.<br>
The gasifier 300 also includes a fixed or static coal distribution device, generally<br>
indicated by reference numeral 350, inside the coal gasification chamber 320. The coal<br>
distribution device 350 includes a hollow substantially frusto-conical open ended coal<br>
distributor, generally indicated by reference numeral 352. The coal distributor 352 thus has a<br>
smaller opening, generally indicated by reference numeral 354, which is upwardly directed,<br>
i.e. is at the upper end 356 of the coal distributor 352. It also has a larger opening, generally<br>
indicated by reference numeral 358. The larger opening 358 is thus provided at the lower end<br>
360 of the coal distributor.<br>
The coal distributor 352 is made up of a lower hollow open-ended frusto-conical<br>
or truncated-conical section 362 which is attached to the skin 316 of the wall 312 by means<br>
of circumferentially spaced threaded connectors 368. It also includes an intermediate hollow<br>
open-ended frusto-conical section 364 attached to an upper end portion of the section 362, as<br>
well as an upper hollow open-ended frusto-conical section 366, attached to an upper end<br>
portion of the section 364. The upper end of the section 366 thus provides the upper end 356<br>
of the coal distributor 352, while the lower end of the lower section 362 provides the lower<br>
end 360 of the coal distributor 352.<br>
The coal distribution device 350 also includes a circular cylindrical skirt 370<br>
around the inside of the coal distributor 352. An upper end portion of the skirt 370 is<br>
connected to the coal distributor 352, by means of flanged connections 372, roughly midway<br>
between the upper end 356 and the lower end 360 of the coal distributor 352. The lower end<br>
374 of the skirt 370 protrudes beyond the lower end 360 of the coal distributor 352.<br>
The coal distribution device 350 also includes a second skirt 376 around the skirt<br>
370 and spaced therefrom. The upper end 378 of the skirt 376 is mounted to the inside of the<br>
coal distributor 352, in proximity to its lower end 360. The lower end 380 of the skirt 376 is<br><br><br>
located at a lower level than the lower end 360 of the coal distributor 352. The skirt 376<br>
tapers downwardly inwardly so that it is of inverted open-ended hollow frusto-conical form.<br>
An annular outer coal passageway, generally indicated by reference numeral 382,<br>
is provided between the coal distributor 352 and the inner skin 316 of the wall 312. A central<br>
coal passageway, generally indicated by reference numeral 384, is provided by the inside of<br>
the skirt 370. An annular gas collection zone, generally indicated by reference numeral 386,<br>
is defined between the skirts 370, 376. The top of the collection zone 386 is thus closed off<br>
by the section 362 of the coal distributor 352; however, the bottom thereof is in<br>
communication with the coal gasification chamber 320. A gas outlet, generally indicated by<br>
reference numeral 388, is provided in the coal distributor 352. A conduit 390 connects the<br>
gas outlet 388 to the gas outlet passageway 328 of the connection 326 in the wall 312.<br>
The dimensions of the coal distribution device 350, e.g. the height of the coal<br>
distributor 352 and the heights of the skirts 370, 376, are such that the lower ends of the coal<br>
distributor and the skirts are normally located within a coal bed 392 in the gasification<br>
chamber 320. The minimum coal bed level is indicated by broken line 394.<br>
The sections 362, 364 of the coal distributor 350 taper upwardly inwardly at an<br>
angle of about 60° to the horizontal. The diameter of the upper opening 354 of the coal<br>
distributor 352 is typically about 0.5 metres, while that of its lower opening 358 is typically<br>
about 3.4 metres.<br>
A plurality of inwardly directed circumferentially spaced coal distribution ribs,<br>
each generally indicated by reference numeral 396, are provided on the skin 316 of the wall<br>
312, at the level of the lower end 360 of the coal distributor 352. Each distribution rib 396<br>
has an upper coal deflection surface 398 which slopes downwardly away from the wall 312.<br>
In use, the gasification chamber 320 will thus contain the fixed bed 392 of coal,<br>
as indicated in Figure 2. The coal will burn in a fire bed (not shown) located at the bottom of<br>
the coal bed, with ash collecting in an ash bed (not shown) below the fire bed. The burning<br>
of the coal is effected by means of a gasification agent, i.e. a mixture of oxygen and steam,<br>
which enters the bottom of the gasification chamber through outlet or discharge openings in a<br><br><br>
rotating grate (described in more detail hereinafter) located below the fire bed, and above the<br>
ash discharge outlet. On its passage through the coal bed, the gasifying agent thus reacts with<br>
the coal to form raw gas which passes upwardly through the coal bed, collects in the gas<br>
collection zone 386 and exits the gasifier through the gas outlet 388, the conduit 390 and the<br>
gas passageway 328.<br>
To charge coal into the gasification chamber 320, the discharge opening 336 of<br>
the coal lock 330 is opened by moving the closure member 338 from its closed position to its<br>
open position, when the coal bed level, i.e. the top of the coal bed in the chamber 320, is<br>
approximately at the level of the line 394. It will be appreciated that the lower ends of the<br>
coal distributor 352 and the skirts 370,376 will then still be located within the coal bed.<br>
The coal that is discharged from the coal lock 330 will initially free fall into the<br>
outer coal passageway 382, as indicated by arrow 400 in Figure 1, until the top of the coal<br>
bed is more-or-less at the same level as the upper end 356 of the coal distributor 352.<br>
Thereafter, the coal will pass into the central coal passageway 384, as indicated by arrow 402.<br>
Coal passes evenly from the passageways 382 and 384 into the coal bed, i.e. the coal levels in<br>
the passageways 382, 384 remain more-or-less the same as the coal passes therethrough into<br>
the coal bed.<br>
Referring to Figures 5 and 6, reference numeral 200 generally indicates a fixed<br>
bed Lurgi (trademark) coal gasifier according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
Parts of the gasifier 200 which are the same or similar to those of the gasifier<br>
300, are indicated with the same reference numeral.<br>
In the gasifier 200, the coal distributor 352 is mounted to the skin 316 of the wall<br>
312 by means of a horizontally extending cylindrical mounting component or support pipe<br>
202, instead of the connectors 368. The components 202 thus extend from circumferentially<br>
spaced apertures in the section 362 to a bracket 204 attached to the skin 316 of the wall 312.<br><br><br>
In the gasifier 200, the upper section 366 of the coal distributor 352 has been<br>
dispensed with. The upper end 356 of the coal distributor 352 is thus the upper end of the<br>
section 364.<br>
The coal distribution ribs 396 of the gasifier 200 are slightly different in<br>
appearance and construction to those of the gasifier 300; however, they perform the same<br>
function.<br>
The Applicant is aware of known fixed bed Lurgi gasifiers that have a cylindrical<br>
or inwardly tapering, i.e. hollow open-ended inverted frusto-conical, skirt depending from the<br>
roof or head of the gasifier so that coal that is discharged from the coal lock passes along the<br>
inside of the skirt to be distributed into the coal bed, with the lower end of the skirt normally<br>
being located inside the coal bed. An annular gas collection zone is provided between the<br>
skirt and the wall of the gasification chamber, with raw gas which collects in the zone being<br>
withdrawn therefrom through a gas outlet. Such a skirt is also known as a "Bosnian" skirt.<br>
However, in these known gasifiers, segregation of the coal that enters the coal<br>
gasification chamber from the coal lock, into coarser and finer fractions, is experienced. This<br>
problem is brought about when the coal is discharged into the gasification chamber from the<br>
coal lock during the normal loading cycle of the gasifier.<br>
The segregation of the coal into the coarser and finer fractions is as a result of the<br>
following segregation mechanisms:<br>
(a)	when coal flows from a zone of smaller cross-sectional area to one of larger<br>
cross-sectional area in an enclosed passage, some segregation thereof into coarser and finer<br>
fractions occurs due to fines filtering through the body of coal as it flows; and<br>
(b)	when coal flows from a zone of smaller cross-sectional area to one of larger<br>
cross-sectional area in an open space, i.e. not confined by an enclosed passage, segregation<br>
thereof into coarser and finer fractions occurs due to larger or top size particles 'rolling' to the<br>
outside.<br>
Mechanism (b), i.e. free-fall of the coal, is experienced in the first half of a coal<br>
load cycle of the gasifier, i.e. immediately after the coal lock has been opened, and is<br><br><br>
normally associated with well homogenized coal particle size distribution due to 'turbulence'<br>
of flow. The second half of the coal load cycle is associated with 'slow' downward<br>
movement of coal from the coal lock, and mechanism (a) then prevails.<br>
The Applicant has found that with the Bosnian skirt a coarse particle-rich coal<br>
fraction accumulates against the wall of the gasification chamber, i.e. in a near outer diameter<br>
(near jacket) zone 404 as indicated in Figures 2 and 3, with a fine particle- rich coal fraction<br>
accumulating in an annular zone immediately adjacent the near outer diameter zone 404.<br>
Inside the annular zone, there is then a central zone containing a more-or-less normal coal<br>
particle distribution of coarse coal particles (56-100mm), medium coal particles (28-56mm)<br>
and fine coal particles (5-28mm). Typically, the near outer diameter zone is about 0,25<br>
meters thick. It is believed that the coarse particle-rich coal fraction in the near outer<br>
diameter zone results at least in part from segregation of coal particles due to the 'rolling'<br>
action of the largest coal particles to the outer diameter of the coal gasification zone, i.e. due<br>
to mechanism (b).<br><br>
Additionally, it has been found that fine coal particles accumulate against an<br>
inner surface of the Bosnian skirt, due to "filtering" thereof through larger coal particles, as<br>
the coal bed moves downwardly, i.e. due to mechanism (a). These fine coal particles are in<br>
contact with raw gas at the lowermost edge of the skirt, where the raw gas has an increased<br>
velocity due to the reduced cross-sectional diameter of the gas collection zone as compared to<br>
the cross-sectional diameter of the gasification chamber. Thus, fine gas particles which are<br>
picked up by the raw gas stream, do not have much chance of disengaging from the raw gas,<br>
and are thus carried over with the raw gas that is withdrawn from the gasifier.<br>
This segregated particle size distribution ('PSD') results in preferential gas flow<br>
paths, as evidenced by major gasifier instabilities and "hot spots" due to this channelling<br>
phenomenon. In other words, the gasifying agent and the raw gas tend to follow upwardly<br>
extending paths or channels of least resistance through the coal bed. Furthermore, the gas<br>
passes preferentially through coarser coal particles which provides a path of least resistance<br>
through the coal bed so that channelling occurs in the near jacket zone, with resultant high<br>
local heat flux zones occurring there. The Applicant has found that this leads to overheating<br>
of, and subsequent damage to, the jacket wall; poor gasifier operation such as extreme fire<br><br><br>
bed fluctuations, frequent load cutbacks due to temperature instabilities at high gasifier loads,<br>
and high gasifier sensitivity to excess fines in the coal; damaged grate ploughs due to<br>
overheating; etc.<br>
The Applicant has found that, by means of the coal distribution device 350 and<br>
coal distribution ribs 396 of the present invention, a much more uniform PSD of coal<br>
particles is obtained in the top of the coal bed. In particular, the coal distribution device 350<br>
simultaneously distributes coal from the annular passageway or zone 382 as well as from the<br>
central passageway or zone 384 into the coal bed, as indicated in Figure 1. The coal<br>
distribution device 350 also allows upwardly moving counterflowing raw gas to exit the<br>
cross-section of the gasification zone 320 through the annular zone 386 and from there<br>
through the single gas outlet 388. The gas is thus extracted in an annular zone which is<br>
spaced from the wall 312.<br>
It has been found that, with the coal distribution device 350, a more uniform PSD<br>
can be obtained in the coal bed below the coal distribution device 350.<br>
Furthermore, the amount of fines that is in contact with the raw gas at the point<br>
where the raw gas exits the coal bed is reduced, as compared to the Bosnian skirt<br>
configuration, resulting in less carry-over of fine coal particles with the raw gas stream. This<br>
is due to the fact that there is no accumulation of fine coal particles in a layer or zone at or<br>
near the point at which the raw gas separates from the coal bed.<br>
Still further, the coal distribution ribs 396 function in the manner of forcing<br>
coarser coal particles into the area below the overhang provided by the lower edge portion of<br>
the coal distributor 352, while fine coal particles pass between adjacent ribs into the near<br>
jacket zone, as indicated by reference numeral 404 in Figures 2 and 3. There is thus a<br>
concentration of fine particles in the near jacket zone 404. Fine coal particles provide an<br>
increased resistance to gas flow so that substantially reduced channelling takes place in the<br>
near jacket zone, resulting in a substantial reduction in hot spot formation against the inner<br>
skin (jacket) 316. The fine coal particles also act as an insulation layer against the inner skin<br>
316. Due to the shape and positioning of the ribs 396, they do not impede or block passage<br>
of coal particles along the passageway or zone 382.<br><br><br>
Typically, the ribs are mounted to the inner skin 316 with a 130mm pitch. Thus,<br>
with a 4 metre inner diameter gasification chamber 320, a total of 93 such ribs will be<br>
provided. The gaps between adjacent ribs, at the inner skin 316, will thus be sufficiently<br>
small to permit passage of fine coal particles (5-28mm), while not permitting the passage of<br>
coarse particles (58-100mm).<br>
The coal gasifier according to the invention is further characterized thereby that it<br>
does not have a so-called Bosnian skirt nor does it have any static coal distribution device<br>
between the upper end 356 of the coal distributor 352 and the coal lock closure member 338.<br>
By virtue of comparative test runs conducted on known Lurgi gasifiers and a<br>
Lurgi gasifier in accordance with the invention, the following advantages of the gasifier in<br>
accordance with the invention, particularly when compared to the known Lurgi gasifiers,<br>
were identified:<br>
reduced channelling and hot spots against the water jacket<br>
a more stable flat and uniformly thick fire bed<br>
a reduced number of preferential flow paths due to low pressure drop zones in<br>
the coal bed<br>
reduction of heat flux through the water jacker, as evidenced by reduced boiler<br>
feed water consumption in the water jacket, i.e. reduced jacket steam production<br>
a reduction in the numbers of load cutbacks due to process instability<br>
more stable grate operation, and good control of the grate operation<br>
more stable coal lock temperatures, typically within the range of 140°C to 180°C<br>
decreased carry-over of fine coal particles with the raw gas<br>
more stable and controllable (within narrow bands) gas outlet temperatures<br>
(typically 480°C to 530°C) and ash temperatures (typically 290°C to 330°C)<br>
sustainable and, possibly, increased maximum gasifier loads with minimum<br>
negative impact on equipment<br>
enhanced process stability and effective reactions over the reaction zone<br>
Additionally, the coal distribution device 350 and/or the ribs 396 can provide one<br>
or more of the following benefits:<br><br><br>
ability to handle the coal loads and complex thermal expansion requirements of<br>
the gasifier<br>
a degree of height adjustment within the coal gasification chamber<br>
effective cooling of the device since coal is in contact with all metal surfaces of<br>
the coal distribution device 350<br>
an effective gas seal and minimum thermal impact due to the manner in which<br>
the gas outlet 388 is connected to the gas outlet passageway 328, as indicated in Figure 5<br>
removability of the section 366 permits ready access into the gasifier and<br>
removal of gasifier grate components<br>
the angles of inclination of the sections of the coal distributor 352 ensure good<br>
coal mass flow along the coal passageway<br>
little or no blockage or bridging of coal particles occurs in the coal passageways<br>
382,384 or in the coal bed<br>
coal segregation from the coal discharge opening 336 of the coal lock 330 to the<br>
lower end of the coal distribution device 350 is reduced or minimized.<br>
Although the coal distribution device 350 and the ribs 396 have proved to<br>
provide a much more uniform coal particle size distribution over the gasifier radial cross<br>
section than the Bosman skirt, it was found that there is still an unacceptably wide range of<br>
instability present in the gasifier operation, including thermal extremes in an upper region of<br>
the gasifier. A series of experiments on a scaled model indicated that an unexpected annular<br>
region of coarser material formed when the coal distribution device 350 is used. This<br>
problem has been successfully addressed by the present invention, by means of a<br>
modification to the rotatable grate to provide an upwardly projecting finger or disturbing<br>
formation to disturb the ash bed in the gasifier. The rotatable grate used in conjunction with<br>
the coal distribution device 350 is described in more detail hereunder.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the gasifier 300 also includes an inwardly tapering outer<br>
floor 20 which is attached to the lower end of the skin 314, as well as an inner floor 22 which<br>
is attached to the skin 316. The space 318 is thus maintained between the floors 20, 22. In<br>
the zone where the floor 22 is attached to the wall 316, a support component, generally<br>
indicated by reference numeral 24, is provided. The support component 24 has a horizontally<br>
located circumferentially extending radially inwardly protruding portion 26, providing an<br><br><br>
upper horizontal ash collection surface 28, as well as a portion 30, also extending<br>
circumferentially, located between the inner periphery of the portion 26 and the upper end of<br>
the floor 22.<br>
An inner stationary support structure, generally indicated by reference numeral<br>
32, protrudes inwardly from the floor 22 and has a cylindrical component 34 through which<br>
extends a gasification agent feed line or conduit 35 which leads from a supply of the<br>
gasification agent. The gasification agent is thus typically a mixture of oxygen and steam. A<br>
support plate 36 is mounted on the support structure 32 and the component 34.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, the gasifier 300 also includes a grate, generally<br>
indicated by reference numeral 40, located inside the skin 316, at the lower end of the<br>
gasification chamber 320 defined by the skin 316.<br>
The grate 40 comprises a first outer rotatable grate component, generally<br>
indicated by reference numeral 43, as well as a second stationary inner grate component,<br>
generally indicated by reference numeral 44.<br>
The stationary grate component 44 comprises an upright pillar 46 mounted to the<br>
support plate 36. The pillar 46 has a central gasification agent passageway 48 which has an<br>
inlet at the lower end of the pillar, with the inlet being in communication with the gasification<br>
feed line 35; however, the upper end of the passageway 48 is closed off with a venturi<br>
structure 50 to prevent ash intrusion into the passageway 48. The structure 50 comprises end<br>
plates 52 closing off the upper end of the passageway 48 against ash intrusion, and may be<br>
provided with a gasification agent outlet 54 for discharging gasification agent from the<br>
passageway 48 into a zone below a protective cap 56, with gasification agent then passing<br>
outwardly into the gasification chamber 320 along the lower peripheral edge of the cap 56, as<br>
indicated by arrows 58. Preferably, however, the outlet 54 is blocked. A venturi 57 is<br>
located below the end plates 52, for creating a flow induced low pressure and serving to<br>
extract gasification agent leaking between the stationary inner grate component 44 and the<br>
outer rotatable grate component 43, when the outlet 54 is not blocked.<br><br><br>
A number of circumferentially staggered stationary inner ploughs 60 protrude<br>
outwardly from the pillar 46. Breaker ribs 62 are provided around the upper portion of the<br>
pillar 46, i.e. the portion thereof between the ploughs 60 and the end cap structure 50.<br>
A plurality of vertically and circumferentially spaced gasification agent<br>
passageways 64 are provided in the pillar 46 below the ploughs 60.<br>
The outer rotatable grate component 43 comprises a hollow rotatable support<br>
structure 66 rotatably mounted to the pillar 46 by means of thrust bearings 68 and journal<br>
bearings 70 and 72. The support structure 66 includes a ring gear 74 which engages a pinion<br>
gear (not shown) mounted to an output shaft of a gearbox (not shown) driven by a variable<br>
speed electric motor (not shown) for driving the grate component 43 to rotate, typically at<br>
between 2 and 12 rph. Two sets of the pinion gears, gearboxes and motors are provided.<br>
The interior of the support structure 66 is in communication with the<br>
passageways 64 in the pillar 46. The outer surface of the grate component 43 is of conical<br>
form, being stepped or staggered, so as to provide four 'layers' or terraces, generally indicated<br>
by reference numerals 76, 78, 80 and 82 respectively, with the layer or portion 76 having the<br>
largest diameter and the layer or portion 82 having the smallest diameter. Each step or layer<br>
76 to 82 comprises a plurality of circumferentially arranged outer shield plates 84 located in<br>
abutting or overlapping relationship. The shield plates 84 in each layer or step slope<br>
upwardly inwardly. The angle of the outer surface of the grate component 43, as defined by<br>
the shield plates 84, is in the region of 55° to the horizontal, i.e. greater than the angle of<br>
repose of ash which is about 35°to the horizontal. By 'angle of repose' is meant the angle of<br>
maximum incline at which a heaped mass of loose coal ash will be stable with no particles<br>
sliding down this incline.<br>
The shield plates 84 in the layers or portions 76 and 78 are mounted to a lower<br>
support ring 83 forming part of the grate component 43, while the shield plates in the layers<br>
or portions 80 and 82 are mounted to an upper support ring 85 also forming part of the grate<br>
component 43. Each support ring typically comprises three segments which are attached<br>
together.<br><br><br>
Circumferentially extending gasification agent outlets are provided in the grate<br>
component 43 such that the gasification agent can flow underneath the lower edges of the<br>
outer shield plates 84 at each level or step, as indicated by arrows 86. The configuration of<br>
the shield plates thus ensures the gasification agent flow and also prevents ash intrusion into<br>
the grate component 43. An additional circumferential gasification agent outlet 88 may also<br>
be provided at the upper end of the grate component 43 so that gasification agent can also be<br>
distributed therethrough as indicated by arrow 90. Typically, however, this is not preferred.<br>
Additionally, a negligible amount of gasification agent can pass between the<br>
rotating support structure 66 and the stationary pillar 46, via a join line 92, also to be<br>
discharged through the venturi 57 and the structure 50.<br>
The support structure 66 includes an annular floor plate 93 immediately below<br>
the lower edges of the ploughs 60 so that ploughs act as scrapers as the plate rotates below<br>
them, in use.<br>
An inner breaker ring 95, having ribs 94, is provided around an upper portion of<br>
the support ring 85, while an outer breaker ring 98, having ribs 96, is provided on the support<br>
structure 66.<br>
Three circumferentially spaced outer ploughs 100 are attached to the outer grate<br>
component 43 and are arranged such that they pass with limited clearance over the ash<br>
collection surface 28 of the component 26.<br>
A first ash discharge passageway 102 is defined between the skin 316, support<br>
component 24 and the grate component 43. The first ash discharge passageway 102<br>
comprises a first annular portion 104 defined between the shield plates 84 of the grate<br>
component 43 and the skin 316, as well as a second portion 106 protruding radially inwardly<br>
from the lower end of the portion 104, along the surface 28 and along a wear plate 108.<br>
The wear plate 108 protrudes inwardly from the component 26, and is provided<br>
with a collar portion 110, which is also fitted with breaker ribs 112.<br><br><br>
The breaker ribs 62 and breaker ring 94 define between them a first cylindrical<br>
portion 116 of a second ash discharge passageway 114. The passageway 114 also has a<br>
second portion, generally indicated by reference numeral 118, protruding radially outwardly<br>
from the lower end of the portion 116, as well as a third annular portion, generally indicated<br>
by reference numeral 120, which is in communication with the portion 118.<br>
The breaker rings 96, 112 define between them an annular ash discharge<br>
passageway, generally indicated by reference numeral 122, into which ash is discharged from<br>
the portion 106 of the passageway 102. The portion 120 of the passageway 114 also<br>
discharges ash into the ash discharge passageway 122.<br>
It will be appreciated that ash discharged through the passageways 102, 114 and<br>
122, which are thus in proximity to or adjacent the floors 22, falls into a floor zone of the<br>
gasifier 300 and is discharged through an ash outlet (not shown) provided at the lower end of<br>
the gasifier.<br>
The grate 40 includes an upwardly projecting finger or disturbing formation 500<br>
(only shown in Figure 8 of the drawings) mounted on the radially outermost, lowest layer or<br>
step or terrace 76. The finger 500 has a height which is slightly less than the height of the<br>
pillar 46.<br>
In use, the gasifier 300 is operated by feeding coal batchwise into the top thereof<br>
through the coal lock 330 while injecting gasifying agent as hereinbefore described<br>
continuously into the bottom of the reaction zone through the gasification agent outlets as<br>
hereinbefore described, thereby to gasify coal located in a slow moving bed within the<br>
gasification chamber 320. Ash is continuously withdrawn from the bottom of the gasification<br>
zone by the rotation of the gasifier component 43 which leads to the ploughs 100 continually<br>
rotating and discharging ash through the passageway 102. Simultaneously, ash is discharged<br>
through the passageway 114.<br>
Typically, about 20% of the ash is removed through the passageway 114, and<br>
about 80% through the passageway 102. As the grate component 43 rotates, clinker crushing<br>
is performed between the breaker ribs 62, 94, between the shield plates 84 and the skin 316,<br><br><br>
and between the breaker ribs 96 and 112, as hereinafter described in greater detail. The<br>
shield plates 84 also protect the grate 40 against wear and high ash temperatures.<br>
By 'clinker' is meant a solid agglomerate of melted ash which needs to be crushed<br>
to enable it to be extracted from the gasifier.<br>
Typically 0% of the total gasifying agent passes into the gasification chamber<br>
320 underneath the end cap arrangement 50, a negligible amount along arrow 90, about 10%<br>
through the circumferential outlet underneath the lower edges of the outer shield plates 84 in<br>
the layer or portion 82, about 20% through the similar outlet in the layer or portion 80, about<br>
30% through the similar outlet in the layer of portion 78, and about 40% through the similar<br>
outlet in the layer or portion 76. The gasification agent also serves to cool the grate<br>
components, such as the outer shield plates 84, as it passes through the rotating grate<br>
component 43.<br>
The ash withdrawal proportions through the passageways 102, 114 and the<br>
gasification agent proportions through the various outlets, as given above, are balanced<br>
according to the annular cross-sectional areas immediately above the agent outlets and the<br>
ash discharge passageways.<br>
When the grate 40 is rotated, the finger formation 500 disturbs the ash bed and in<br>
particular any hang-ups against the grate 40 and/or against the skin 316, resulting in the<br>
opening up of the fuel bed. Homogenisation of the ash and coal throughout the cross section<br>
of the fuel bed leads to improved steam and oxygen distribution, increased gasifier stability<br>
as a result of the reduction of preferential flow paths and hot spots and it is expected that it<br>
may also lead to lower CO2 in the gasifier product gas. The use of the finger formation 500<br>
unexpectedly addresses the problem of thermal extremes in the upper region of the gasifier.<br>
This is believed to be due to the bed homogenisation effect of the finger formation 500. The<br>
beneficial effect of the use of the finger formation 500 is further enhanced by specifically<br>
targeting areas of high flow resistance in the coal bed by distributing the gasification agent to<br>
these areas, as described hereinbefore. Thus, in contrast to known gasifier operations, a<br>
substantial portion of the gasification agent is now fed into the coal bed closer to the skin 316<br>
to penetrate the outer ring of fine coal in the near jacket zone 404.<br><br><br>
By, amongst others, controlling the rate of ash withdrawal, the interface (not<br>
shown) between a coal ash bed located towards the bottom of the chamber 320 and the coal<br>
bed which will thus be located above the interface, is maintained at a desired position. A fire<br>
bed thus constitutes this interface.<br>
Ideally, for good gasifier control, the fire bed should be in a more-or-less<br>
horizontal line across the gasification zone, thereby indicating uniform mass flow withdrawal<br>
of ash across the entire radial cross-section of the gasification chamber 320, i.e. uniform ash<br>
withdrawal with uniform ash particle velocity. In other words, the fire bed profile should,<br>
ideally, be stable, flat and in equilibrium. There should be no vertical movement or<br>
displacement of the fire bed, i.e. it should be located in a fixed position within the gasifier,<br>
and the fire bed thickness should be uniform across the gasification zone. The gasification<br>
agent should, ideally, move upwardly on a mass flow basis, i.e. be distributed uniformly<br>
throughout the radial cross-section of the reactor and have a uniform velocity throughout the<br>
cross-section.<br>
With the grate 40, the fire bed profile is stable and symmetrical, being of<br>
flattened W-shape. In other words, it has an equilibrium profile. The fire bed level moves<br>
within a restricted narrow vertical band and hence is stable, while it is of relatively uniform<br>
thickness. The gasification agent is distributed upwardly on an approximated mass flow<br>
basis, while ash extraction similarly takes place on an approximated mass flow basis<br>
downwardly, when about 20% of the ash is removed through the passageway 114 and about<br>
80% thereof through the passageway 102. It is believed that up to six of the outer ploughs<br>
100 can be used while up to four of the stationary ploughs 60 can be used. Still further, the<br>
outer surface of the grate component 43, as provided by the shield plates 84, is about 55° to<br>
the horizontal, i.e. greater than the angle of repose of ash. This promotes ash, which abuts the<br>
shield plates 84, moving downwardly towards the periphery to be removed by the ploughs<br>
100 rather than creating stagnant zones.<br>
With the grate 40, there are relatively large forces driving the ash downwardly<br>
and inwardly in the region of the ploughs 100, 60, while there are relatively small forces<br>
driving ash upwardly and over the ploughs, resulting in less wear on the ploughs and the<br><br><br>
outer shield plates 84. Additionally, the wear is spread over all the shield plates, and there is<br>
a lower propensity for wear due to the fact that 20% of the ash passes through the ash<br>
passageway 114 and thus does not pass over the wear plates 84.<br>
It is believed that with the grate 40, and with which peripheral as well as central<br>
ash extraction is effected, effective primary crushing, in which clinkers are crushed in stages,<br>
are effected, due to the grate angle being greater than the angle of repose of ash. This applies<br>
to both the inner or central breaker rings 94, as well as the outer breaker or crusher rings<br>
constituted by the 'layers' 76, 78, 80 and 82 of outer shield plates 84. Additionally, there is no<br>
'dead zone' between the angle of repose of ash and the grate surface angle, since the grate<br>
angle, typically about 55° to horizontal, is greater than the angle of repose of ash which is<br>
about 35° to the horizontal. The breaker rings are thus placed positively into the active or<br>
live ash region of the ash bed. Little, if any, ash arching and clinker bridging are<br>
experienced, resulting in little or no difference between the theoretical ash withdrawal<br>
velocity and the actual ash withdrawal velocity. With the grate 40, gasification agent<br>
distribution is substantially more uniform, and there is thus a more uniform upward velocity<br>
component of the fire bed, due to the agent being distributed in a less segregated mass flow<br>
moving ash bed which is homogenised by the finger formation 500.<br>
Referring to Figure 9 of the drawings, the gasifier 300 is shown with a grate 600<br>
which differs in some respects from the grate 40 shown in Figures 7 and 8. Many of the<br>
features of the grate 600 are the same as or similar to the features of the grate 40 and where<br>
possible, the same reference numbers have thus been used to indicate the same or similar<br>
parts or features.<br>
Instead of the first outer rotatable grate component 43 that forms part of the grate<br>
40, the grate 600 includes a rotatable grate component 602 which is the only rotatable grate<br>
component. For the grate 600, there is thus no second stationary inner grate component 44.<br>
In Figure 9, a pinion gear 604 and an ash outlet 606 are shown. These features<br>
are not shown in Figures 7 and 8.<br><br><br>
As a result of the absence of the second stationary grate component 44, the<br>
gasifier 300 shown in Figure 9 has only one ash discharge passageway 102 and not a second<br>
ash discharge passageway 114. The protective cap 56 does not close the passageway 48.<br>
Instead, the outlet 54 is open to allow gasification agent to flow through the conduit 35 and<br>
the passageway 48 into the hollow interior of the rotatable grate component 602, as shown by<br>
arrows 610. Unlike the grate 40, the grate 600 does not have gasification agent passageways<br>
64 in the pillar 46.<br>
In use, the grate component 602 is rotated anti-clockwise. Coal is fed<br>
batchwise into the top of the gasifier 300 and gasification agent is fed into the bottom of<br>
the reaction zone through the gasification agent outlets underneath the lower edges of the<br>
outer shield plates 84 as hereinbefore described, thereby to gasify coal located in a slow<br>
moving bed within the gasification chamber 320. Ash is continuously withdrawn from the<br>
bottom of the gasification zone by the rotation of the rotatable grate component 602 which<br>
leads to the ploughs 100 continually rotating and discharging ash through the ash<br>
discharge passageway 102. The flow of ash is indicated by the arrows 608 in Figure 9.<br>
As the grate component 602 rotates, clinker crushing is performed between the shield<br>
plates 84 and the skin 316, and between the breaker ribs 96 and 112.<br>
Typically, about 10% of the total gasification agent passes into the gasification<br>
chamber 320 underneath the lower edges of the outer shield plates 84 in the layer or<br>
portion 82, about 20% from underneath the layer or portion 80, about 30% from<br>
underneath the layer or portion 78 and about 40% from underneath the layer or portion 76.<br>
During rotation of the grate component 602, the finger formation 500 disturbs the ash bed,<br>
leading to improved gasifier operation as hereinbefore described.<br>
As with the grate 40, when the grate 600 is rotated, the finger formation 500<br>
disturbs the ash bed and in particular any hang-ups against the grate 600 and/or against the<br>
skin 316, resulting in the opening up of the fuel bed. Homogenisation of the ash and coal<br>
throughout the cross section of the fuel bed leads to improved steam and oxygen distribution,<br>
increased gasifier stability as a result of the reduction of preferential flow paths and hot spots<br>
and it is expected that it may also lead to lower CO2 in the gasifier product gas. The use of<br>
the finger formation 500 unexpectedly addresses the problem of thermal extremes in the<br><br><br>
upper region of the gasifier. This is believed to be due to the bed homogenisation effect of<br>
the finger formation 500. The beneficial effect of the use of the finger formation 500 is<br>
further enhanced by specifically targeting areas of high flow resistance in the coal bed by<br>
distributing the gasification agent to these areas, as described hereinbefore. Thus, in contrast<br>
to known gasifier operations, a substantial portion of the gasification agent is now fed into the<br>
coal bed closer to the skin 316 to penetrate the outer ring of fine coal in the near jacket zone<br>
404.<br><br>
