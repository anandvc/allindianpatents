				<td>The present invention relates to a polyurethane polymer.<br>
The present invention relates to polyurethane dispersants, to dispersions, millbases, paints and inks containing a particulate solid which is dispersed in an aqueous medium, including inks for use in non-contact printing processes such as "Drop-on-demand" printing processes.<br>
There are a large number of patent specifications which disclose water-soluble or water-dispersible polyurethane polymers which contain poly (ethylene oxide) chain segments which may be present in lateral or terminal chains attached to a polyurethane backbone. Typically, these specifications relate to polymer stabilisation in aqueous media and to the use of such polymers in the coating industry. One example of such specifications is US 4,764,533 which discloses a water-soluble or dispersible polyurethane containing about 0.5 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the polyurethane, of ethylene oxide units present in lateral or terminal poiyether chains and 0.1 to 120 milliequivalents per 100gm of the polyurethane, of carboxylic acid groups. There is no suggestion that these polyurethane polymers may be used to disperse pigments in aqueous media.<br>
US 4,794,147 discloses two. types of poiyether containing polyurethane resins one of which is a laterally stabilised polyurethane containing composition and the other relates to a terminally stabilised polyurethane coating composition. The object of the invention is stated to be the provision of water-dispersible resins without incorporating salt-forming groups into the resins. There is no suggestion that the resins contain both lateral and terminal poiyether chains and in the case of lateral poiyether chains none of the examples contain more than 10% by weight of ethylene oxide units.<br>
Patent specifications which disclose the use of polyurethane dispersants for dispersing pigments in aqueous media have appeared more recently for Inkjet printing. Thus US 5,969,002 discloses a water soluble polyurethane having hydrophilic poiyether chains and an isocyanate group content of not more than 1.0% by weight containing 30 to 95% by weight of ethylene oxide units arranged within poiyether chains and incorporated via mono-functional alcohols and also having an anionic group content of 0 to 200 milliequivalents per 100 gram poiyisocyanate addition product. The isocyanates have a functionality of 1.7 to 6 although a preferred functionality is from 3.0 to 6.0. Since the poiyether chains are incorporated within monofunctional alcohols these chains are terminally attached to the polyurethane backbone. A similar disclosure is US 6,136,890 where the polyurethane dispersant contains a group with up to 11% by weight of monovalent polyethylene oxide units.<br>
It has now been found that superior dispersants may be obtained where the polyurethane contains a large amount of ethylene oxide repeat units in lateral chains attached to a polyurethane backbone. Examples of improved properties are higher pigment loading at equivalent millbase viscosity and improved functional properties such<br>
as gloss, colour strength or, in the case of black pigments, "jetness" when the pigment dispersion or millbase is incorporated into a paint film<br>
According to the invention there is provided a polyurethane polymer comprising from 35 to 90% by weight of poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) based on the total weight of the polyurethane polymer wherein not less than 60% by weight of the poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) is poly {ethylene oxide) and wherein at least 5% by weight of the poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) based on the weight of the polyurethane polymer is incorporated in lateral chains and which contains from 10 to 180 milliequivaients of acid groups for each 100 gms polyurethane when the polyurethane polymer contains from 35 to 45% by weight poly(alkylene oxide)<br>
When the polyurethane polymer contains not less than 45% by weight of poly (alkylene oxide) it is also preferred that it contains from 10 to 180 milliequivaients of acid groups for each 100 gm polyurethane polymer<br>
Preferably at least 10%, more preferably at least 20% and especially at least 30% of the poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) based on the weight of the polyurethane polymer is incorporated in lateral chains.<br>
It is also preferable that the acid groups in the polyurethane polymers are carboxylic acid groups<br>
The polyurethane polymer essentially comprises a linear backbone containing lateral poly (alkylene oxide) chains and optionally carboxylic acid groups. The polyurethane chains may also optionally carry terminal poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) chains. The polyurethane backbone is more hydrophobic in character than the lateral poly (alkylene oxide) chains Without being bound to any specific mechanism involving the dispersion of particulate solids such as pigments in aqueous media it is thought that the relatively hydrophobic backbone of the polyurethane polymer interacts with the surface of the particulate solid and that the lateral poly (alkylene oxide) chains stabilise the coated particulate solid in the aqueous medium<br>
Whereas some degree of branching of the polyurethane backbone may be tolerated such branching should not lead to cross-linked matrices which impair the ability of the polyurethane polymer to disperse the particulate solid throughout the aqueous medium<br>
Preferably, the amount of poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) is not less than 40% and especially not less than 50% based on the total weight of the polyurethane polymer. It is also preferred that the amount of poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) is not greater than 80% and especially not greater than 70% based on the total weight of the polyurethane polymer<br>
The amount of poly (ethylene oxide) in the poly {C2-4-alkylene oxide) which is located in the lateral and terminal chains, if present, of the polyurethane polymer is preferably not less than 70% and especially not less than 80% of the poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide)<br>
When the poly (alkylene oxide) chains contain repeat units other than ethyleneoxy, these may be propyleneoxy or butyleneoxy which may be arranged in random or block sequences.<br>
Preferably the polyurethane polymer is unbranched.<br>
The number average molecular weight of the poly (alkylene oxide) chains which are laterally or terminally attached to the polyurethane backbone is preferably not greater than 5,000, more preferably not greater than 3,000 and especially not greater than 2,500. The molecular weight of the poly (alkylene oxide) chain is also preferably not less than 350 and especially not less than 600 Good dispersants have been obtained where the number average molecular weight of the poly (alkylene oxide) chain is in the range of 350 to 2,500.<br>
The amount of acid groups in the polyurethane polymer is preferably not greater than 110, more preferably not greater than 75 and especially not greater than 60 milllequivalents for each 100gm of the polyurethane polymer It is also preferred that the amount of carboxylic acid groups is not less than 20 milllequivalents for each lOOgm of polyurethane polymer. The acid groups may be present as the free acid or in the form of a salt Preferably the salt is that of an alkali metal cation such as potassium, lithium or sodium, ammonia, amine or quaternary ammonium cation, including mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable amines are ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethylamine Examples of suitable quaternary ammonium salts are the C1-6 alkyl quaternary ammonium salts   It is preferred that the acid is present as the salt of ammonia or other volatile amine.<br>
The polyurethane polymers are obtainable by reacting together.<br>
a)	one or more poly isocyanates having an average functionality of from 2 0 to 2 5,<br>
b)	one or more compounds having at least one poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain and at least two groups which react with isocyanates which are located at the one end of the compound such that the poly (C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain(s) is laterally disposed in relation to the polyurethane polymer backbone;<br>
c)	optionally, one or more compounds having at least one acid group and at least two groups which react with isocyanates,<br>

e)	optionally, one or more compounds which act as chain terminators which contain one group which reacts with isocyanate groups.<br>
f)	optionally, one or more compounds which act as chain terminators which contain a single isocyanate group<br>
Preferably component (c) is a compound having one acid group.<br>
As noted hereinbefore the poiyurethane polymers according to the invention are essentially linear in character with respect to the polymer backbone. It is therefore preferred that the isocyanate which is component (a) has an average functionality of from 2 0 to 2 1   Examples of isocyanates are diisocyanates such as toluene diisocyanate (TDl), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), hexanediisocyanate (HDI), α, α'-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate (TMXDI), diphenylmethane-4, 4'-diisocyanate (MDI) and dicyclohexylmethane-4, 4'-diisocyanate (HMD!)   Preferred diisocyanates are TDl, IPDI and HMDI<br>
The compound having a poly (alkylene oxide) chain which is component (b) preferably contains two groups which react with isocyanates   There are a number of ways of incorporating a poly (alkylene oxide) lateral chain into an organic compound which contains these groups which react with isocyanates<br>
Thus, in the case where the two groups which react with isocyanates are both hydroxy!, the poly (C2.4-alkylene oxide) chain may be conveniently attached by isocyanates having a functionality of two or more   Compounds of this type are described in US 4,794,147 which involves sequentially reacting a mono-functional polyether with a polyisocyanate to produce a partially capped isocyanate intermediate and reacting the intermediate with a compound having at least one active ammo hydrogen and at least two active hydroxyl groups.<br>

As noted hereinbefore, it is preferred that the polyurethane backbone is more hydrophobic than the lateral or terminal chains (when present). Consequently, In the case of copolymers involving ethylene oxide repeat units in component (d) it is preferred that the amount of ethylene oxide in component d is not greater than 40%, more preferably not greater than 20% and especially not greater than 10% by weight of the copolymer   It is particularly preferred that polyalkylene glycol is free from ethyleneoxide repeat units.<br>
As noted hereinbefore, it is preferred that the polyurethane polymer backbone is essentially linear in character  However, some small amount of branching may be tolerated and this branching may conveniently be introduced by means of a higher functional polyol such as timethylol propane, trimethylolethane or pentaerythritol.<br>
As disclosed hereinbefore the chain terminating compound which is component<br>
(e)	is mono-functional with respect to the isocyanate. The monofunctional group is<br>
preferably an ammo or hydroxy group. Preferred terminating groups are poly<br>
(C2-4-alkylene) mono alkyl ethers and mono alkyl ether amines similar to those used in the<br>
preparation of the lateral side chain compounds which are component (b) of the<br>
polyurethane<br>
An example of a monoisocyanate which acts as a chain teminating compound (component f) is phenyl isocyanate<br>
It is much preferred that the amount of component (f) is zero.<br>
Typical amounts of the aforementioned compounds from which the polyurethane polymers are obtainable are 15 - 50% component (a), 10 - 80% component (b), 0 - 24% component (c), 0 - 25% component (d), 0 - 50% component (e) and 0 - 20% component (f), all based on the total weight of the polyurethane polymer<br>
When component (e) is a monofunctional polyether, the total amount of component (b) with component (e) is preferably not less than 35% and where component (e) is other than a monofunctional polyether the amount of component (b) is preferably not less than 35%<br>
The polyurethane polymers according to the invention may be prepared by any method known to the art  Typically, the polyurethane polymer is obtainable by reacting one or more isocyanates having a functionality of from 2 0 to 2.5 (component (a)) with one or more compounds having a poly {C2-4-alkylene oxide) chain and at least two groups which react with isocyanates which are located at one end (component (b)) under substantially anhydrous conditions and in an inert atmosphere at a temperature between 30 and 130°C, optionally in the presence of an inert solvent and optionally In the presence of a catalyst  Optionally, the reaction may also be carried out in the presence of one or more compounds having at least one acid group (component (c)) and one or more formative compounds acting as chain extenders (component (d)) and optionally one or more compounds which act as chain terminating compounds which are components (e) and (f)<br>
The inert atmosphere may be provided by any of the inert gases of the Periodic Table but is preferably nitrogen<br>
The preparation of the polyurethane polymer/prepolymer may be carried out in the presence of a catalyst Particularly preferred catalysts are tin complexes of aliphatic acids such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) and tertiary amines<br>
The essential feature of the polyurethane polymer according to the invention is that It compnses a predominantly linear polyurethane polymer backbone containing the defined amount of lateral poly (alkylene oxide) side chains. There will thus be many variants which will be obvious to the skilled addressee regarding the ratio of isocyanate groups to isocyanate reactive groups including the formulation of prepolymers which have residual isocyanate functionality. In one case, the ratio of total isocyanate groups provided by component (a) is less than the total number of isocyanate reactive groups provided by component (b) and components (c) (d) and (e) when present. Any terminal isocyanate reactive groups may be reacted<br>
Alternatively, the ratio of total number of isocyanate groups provided by component (a) and optionally component (f) is greater that the total number of isocyanate reactive groups provided by component (b) and components (c), (d) and (e) when present. The resultant polyurethane is then a prepolymer containing residual isocyanate functionality   This prepoiymer may then be reacted with other chain extenders such as component (d) which conjoin different prepolymer chains and/or with chain terminating compounds which are component (e) either pnor to or dunng dissolution in water or other polar solvent<br>
The preparation of prepolymers can be useful since it is a means of controlling viscosity dunng the preparation of the polyurethane polymer, especially in circumstances where the reaction is carried out in the absence of any solvent.<br>
When a prepolymer is formed which contains isocyanate functionality, chain extension may be carried out by water itself, or a polyoi, amino-alcohol, a primary or secondary aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, araliphatic or heterocyclic polyamine especially a<br>
diamine, hydrazine or a substituted hydrazine. Water-soluble chain extenders are preferred.<br>
Examples of suitable chain extenders include ethylenediamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, propylenediamine, butylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, cyclohexylenediamine, piperazine, 2-methyl piperazine, phenylenediamine, tolylene diamine, xylylene diamine, tns (2-aminoethy)amine, 3,3'-dinitrobenzidme, 4,4'methylenebis (2-chloraniline), 3,3'-dichloro-4, 4'bi-phenyl diamine, 2,6-diaminopyndine, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane, methane diamine, m-xyiene diamine, isophorone diamine, and adducts of diethylene tnamine with acryiate or its hydrolyzed products. Also materials such as hydrazine, azines such as acetone azine, substituted hydrazines such as, for example, dimethyl hydrazine, 1,6-hexamethylene-bis-hydrazine, carbodihydreazine, hydrazides of dicarboxylic acids and suiphonic acid such as adipic acid mono- or dihydrazide, xalic acid dihydrazide, isophthalic acid dihydrazide, tartaric acid dihydrazide, 1,3-phenylene disulphonic acid dihydrazide, omega-aminocaproic acid dihydrazide, hydrazides made by reacting lactones with hydrazide such as gamma-hydroxylbutyric hydrazide, bis-semi-carbazide carbonic esters of glycols such as any of the glycols mentioned above.<br>
Where the chain extender is other than water, for example, a diamine or hydrazine, it may be added to an aqueous dispersion of prepolymer or, alternatively, it may already be present in an aqueous medium other than that in which the prepolymer is dispersed/dissolved.<br>
The chain extension can be conducted at elevated, reduced or ambient temperatures   Convenient temperatures are from about 5°C to 95°C.<br>
When employing a prepolymer in the preparation of the polyurethane polymer, the amount of chain extender and chain terminating compound are chosen to control the molecular weight of the polyurethane polymer  A high molecular weight will be favoured when the number of isocyanate-reactive groups in the chain extender is approximately equivalent to the number of free isocyanate groups in the prepolymer. A lower molecular weight of the polyurethane polymer is favoured by using a combination of chain extender and chain terminator in the reaction with the polyurethane prepolymer<br>
An inert solvent may be added before, dunng or after formation of the polyurethane polymer/prepolymer in order to control viscocity. Examples of suitable solvents are acetone, methylethylketone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, diglyme, N-methylprrolidone. ethylacetate, ethylene and propylene glycoldiacetates, alkyl ethers of ethylene and propylene glycol acetates, toluene, xylene and sterically hindered alcohols such as t-butanoi and diacetone alcohol   Preferred solvents are acetone, methyl ethyiketone and N-methyl pyrrolldone<br>
The number average molecular weight of the polyurethane polymer is preferably not less than 2,000, more preferably not less than 3,000 and especially not less than 4,000   It is also preferred that the number average molecular weight of the polyurethane<br>
polymer is not greater than 50,000, more preferably not greater than 20,000 and especially not greater than 15,000<br>
The polyurethane polymer according to the invention is used as a dispersant for uniformly distnbuting a particulate solid in a polar media and preferably in a predominantly aqueous media. Hence, it is much preferred that the polyurethane is prepared in the absence of any inert solvent   Where a solvent is required it is preferably volatile such as acetone in order to facilitate its removal by evaporation.<br>
As disclosed hereinbefore, the polyurethane dispersants according to the invention are of use of for dispersing a particulate solid in a polar liquid medium, such as water Although there are many references to aqueous polyurethane dispersions these refer to polyurethanes which are often used as the pnncipal film-forming polymer for a variety of applications such as coatings, inks and adhesives  The dispersions according to the invention preferably comprise a non-polymenc particulate solid, and especially a pigment<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a dispersion compnsing a particulate solid, a polar liquid and a polyurethane polymer as descnbed hereinbefore Preferably the particulate solid is other than a polyurethane polymer. The polar liquid preferably comprises hydroxy functional solvents such as alcohols and glycols It is specially preferred that the polar liquid Is water.<br>
The solid present in the dispersion may be any inorganic or organic solid material which is substantially insoluble in the polar liquid at the temperature concerned and which It is desired to stabilise in a finely divided form therein.<br>
Examples of suitable solids are pigments, extenders and fillers for paints and plastics matenals, dyes, especially disperse dyes, optical brightening agents, dirt and solid particles in aqueous cleaning fluids, particulate ceramic matenals, magnetic materials and magnetic recording media, fire retardants such as those used in plastics materials and biocides, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals which are applied as dispersions.<br>
A preferred solid is a pigment from any of the recognised classes of pigments descnbed, for example, in the Third Edition of the Colour Index (1971) and subsequent revisions of, and supplements thereto, under the chapter headed "Pigments" Examples of inorganic pigments are titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, Prussian blue, cadmium sulphide, iron oxides, vermilion, ultramanne and the chrome pigments, including chromates, molybdates and mixed chromates and sulphates of lead, zinc, barium, calcium and mixtures and modifications thereof which are commercially available as greenish-yellow to red pigments under the names primrose, lemon, middle, orange, scarlet and red chromes. Examples of organic pigments are those from the azo, disazo, condensed azo, thioindigo, indanthrone, isoindanthrone, anthanthrone, anthraquinone, isodibenzanthrone, triphendioxazine, quinacndone and phthalocyanine series, especially copper phthalocyanine and its nuclear halogenated derivatives, and also lakes of acid, basic and mordant dyes Carbon black, although stnctly inorganic, behaves more like an organic pigment in its dispersing properties    Preferred organic pigments are phthalocyanines.<br>
especially copper phthalocyanines, monoazos, disazos, indanthrones, anthranthrones, quinacridones and carbon blacks.<br>
Other preferred solids are: extenders and fillers such as talc, kaolin, silica, barytes and chalk; particulate ceramic materials such as alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, silicon nitride, boron nitnde, silicon carbide, boron carbide, mixed silicon-aluminium nitrides and metal titanates, particulate magnetic matenals such as the magnetic oxides of transition metals, especially iron and chromium, e g. gamma-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and cobalt-doped iron oxides, calcium oxide, ferntes, especially banum ferrites, and metal particles, especially metallic iron, nickel, cobalt and alloys thereof, agrochemicals such as the fungicides flutriafen, carbendazim, chlorothalonil and mancozeb and fire retardants such as aluminium tnhydrate and magnesium hydroxide<br>
By the term "polar" in relation to the polar liquid is meant an organic liquid or medium capable of forming moderate to strong bonds as described in the article entitled "A Three Dimensional Approach to Solubility" by Crowley et al in Journal of Paint Technology, Vol 38, 1966, at page 269. Such organic media generally have a hydrogen bonding number of 5 or more as defined in the abovementioned article<br>
Examples of suitable polar organic liquids are amines, ethers, especially lower alkyl ethers, organic acids, esters, ketones, glycols, alcohols and amides. Numerous specific examples of such moderately and strongly hydrogen bonding liquids are given in the book entitled "Compatibility and Solubility" by ibert Mellan (published in 1968 by Noyes Development Corporation) in Table 2 14 on pages 39-40 and these liquids all fall within the scope of the term polar organic liquid as used herein It is preferred that the polar liquid is of the strongly H-bonding type as exemplified on page 40.<br>
Preferred polar organic liquids are mono and poly hydroxy alcohols especially such liquids containing up to, and including, a total of 6 carbon atoms. As examples of the preferred liquids there may be mentioned alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol and ethylene glycol. It is especially prefen-ed that the polar liquid is water which may contain up to 50% by weight of a water-soluble polar organic liquid preferably up to 20% of a water-soluble polar organic liquid.<br>
Thus, according to a still further aspect of the invention there Is provided a mill-base compnsing a particulate solid, dispersant and a water compatible film-forming binder resin The water compatible resin may be any water-soluble or water insoluble polymer which is used in the water-borne coating industry   Examples of polymers which are commonly used as the pnncipal film-forming binder resin in latex or water-reducible coatings are acrylic, vinyl ester, polyurethane, polyester, epoxy and alkyd<br>
The dispersion or millbase may also contain a vanety of other ingredients which are conventionally incorporated such as antifoam agents and preservatives<br>
Typically, the mill-base contains from 10 to 80% by weight particulate solid based on the total weight of the mill-base.<br>
Where the particulate solid is an organic pigment or a standard carbon black pigment having a surface area below 200 m2 /g, the dispersion may conveniently contain from 20% to 50% by weight of pigment but, where the pigment is inorganic, the dispersion may conveniently contain from 30% to 80% by weight of pigment on the same basis The dispersion preferably contains at least 1% and preferably contains up to 100%, both by weight with respect to the weight of pigment, of the dispersant. Where the pigment is an organic pigment or carbon black, the dispersion more preferably contains from 5% to 50% and where the pigment is an inorganic pigment, the dispersion preferably contains from 1 % to 10%, both by weight with respect to the weight of pigment in the dispersion However, for high to very high surface area carbon black (having a surface area &gt;200 m2 /g), the dispersion may contain as low as 3%, but more preferably from 5% to 30%, pigment on the same basis and the amount of dispersant is preferably from 50% to 100% by weight based on the weight of the pigment<br>
As already disclosed such a mill-base or dispersion is useful for the preparation of water-borne paints and inks by admixture with further amounts of water-compatible resin(s) and/or water and other ingredients which are conventionally incorporated into water-borne paints and inks, such as preservatives, stabilisers, antifoaming agents, water miscible cosolvents and coalescing agents Water-borne paints and inks comprising a mill-base or dispersion according to the present invention are a further feature of the present invention<br>
The dispersants according to the invention may also be used to coat particulate solids such as pigments  Thus, according to a still further aspect of the invention there is provided a composition comprising a particulate solid and a polyurethane polymer as dispersant. Such coated particulate solids may be prepared from the dispersions disclosed hereinbefore by removing the polar liquid.<br>
The dispersions and millbases according to the invention are obtainable by any method known to the art and typically comprise milling the particulate solid, polar liquid and polyurethane polymer in the presence of attrition aids until the desired particle size of the particulate solid is achieved   Preferably the mean particle size is less than 30µ, more preferably less than 20µ and especially less than l0µ.<br>
The polyurethane polymers according to the invention exhibit advantages when used as dispersants compared with dispersants of the pnor art. Such advantages include high pigment loadings, lower viscosity of paints, inks and mill-bases, superior gloss, improved colour strength obtained from coloured pigments and "jetness" of black pigments, especially carbon black pigments. These advantages may be obtained without any deleterious effect on other final coating properties such as water resistance.<br>
The dispersion containing pigment, polar liquid medium and polyurethane polymer may be used in non-contact printing such as drop-on-demand or continuous printers which may be of the thermal or piezoelectnc type of printer. The dispersant may be used in any ink jet pnnting ink and includes yellow, magenta, cyan and black disperse dyes or<br>
pigments   The polar liquid in the non-contact printing ink is preferably water but may contain up to 60% by weight of a water-soluble co-solvent. Examples of such co-solvents are diethyiene glycol, glycerol, 2-pyrolidone, N-methylpyrrolidone, cyclohexanol, caprolactone, caprolactam, pentane-1, 5-diol, 2-(butoxyethoxy) ethanol and thiodiglycol, including mixtures thereof<br>
The ink used in non-contact pnnting is typically made available in a replaceable cartndge which contains separate reservoirs as containers for the different coloured inks Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a cartndge containing one or more of a dispersant dyes and/or pigments, a polar liquid and a polyurethane polymer as disclosed hereinbefore.<br>
