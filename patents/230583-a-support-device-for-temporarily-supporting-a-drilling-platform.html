DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 depicts a self-elevating offshore drilling platform P of the type with which the present invention ma}' be used.  It includes a hull H supported above the surface of the water by legs L.  Typically, three or four legs support the floor, with.one.leg at each comer of the hull.  As this description proceeds, it will be apparent that the number of legs' is not important for purposes of the present invention.  The platform P includes<br>
standard drilling equipment, such as cranes C, at least' one derrick: D and -so forth.<br>
The hull H conventionally comprises a floating body by which ths platform is transported to the site at which it is to be used. The legs L are then lowered, until they meet.the seabed S.  Continued lowering of the legs L elevates the hull H above the surface of the water W a suitable distance that provides an air gap to account for wave height and other factors that are well known to those skilled in this art.  This is a conventional operation that is descriBedln more detail in other documents, such as U.S. Patents'No. 4,269,543 and'No. 4,902,169.<br>
FIGS. 2A-2D illustrate one of the legs L. FIG. 2A is an elevation view, depicting the lattice structure T that typifies such legs.  As shown more clearly in FIG. 2B, the lattice 'structure is triangular in" cross-section normal to the longitudinal extent of the leg L.  FIGS. 2C and 2D snow in more detail the manner in which a chord plate CP is disposed at each corner of the triangle and a reinforcing plate RP welded to the chord plate<br>
extends inwardly toward the center of the truss structure. A plurality of<br>
•\ outer truss members OT and cross-truss members CT are welded to the<br>
:hord plate CP and the reinfracing plate KP to form a structure that is extremely strong and rigid in all directions.  In a typical installation, the yuter truss members OT are 12" diameter pipe sections, and the cross russ members CT are 4" diameter pipe sections.  The chord plate CP is -3/4" thick and the reinforcing plate is 3/4" thick.  These members are<br>
lade of sleeL   Cither dimensions and grades of materials can be used<br>
depending on the environment and operating conditions encountered in using the platform.<br>
As seen particularly in FIGS. 2C and 2D, a continuous jacking rack JR. is secured to the lattice structure T at one of the corners of the triangular leg.  The jacking rack is a 2" thick steel plate mounted to the chord plate CP' at the comer by mounting brackets MB disposed at predetermined intervals along the chord plate CP. Each mounting bracket MB includes a pair of Vi" thick steel standoff plates SP having one edge welded to the chord plate CP and the other edge welded to the back of the jacking- rack-JR..  Additional reinforcing members in the form of 1A" thick steel horizontal gusset plates HG and Vi" thick steel vertical gusset plates VG plates are welded variously to the chord plate CP, the standoff plates S, the jacking rack JR and each other to provide rigidity hi all directions. (The vertical gusset plates VG are omitted from FIG. 2D for clarity.) As with the other components of the leg L, different dimensions and materials can be used for the components just described depending on the environment and operating conditions encountered in using the platform.<br>
In operation, the platform P is elevated by jacks (not shown) at the corner locations on the platform P where the legs extend through the hull H. The jacking rack JR has on its outer edge a series of jacking teeth JT at a .predetermined pitch TP. The teeth JT on the portion of a leg L extending through the platform hull H engage one or more pinion gears on one or more jacks mounted on the hull H.  As jacking motors, cause .the pinion gears to rotate, the legs L are lowered into the water.   The teeth JT on<br>
successive leg sections form: a continuous  jacking rack. In this fashion the legs are lowered until they sink into the seabed S and anchor securely therein. Further j-acking elevates the platform above the surface of the water W.  The hull is secured in position relative to the legs L by brakes (not shown) incorporated into the jacking system.<br>
This is a conventional manner of setting up a platform for undersea drilling operations'. However, on occasion the jacks and the brakes must be inspected or serviced or both. In platforms without other structure for locking the hull to the legs, this requires that the legs be extracted from the seabed and the platform towed to a drydock. Clearly a system whereby the jacks and brakes can be made accessible in situ would be preferable to talcing the platform out of service for such maintenance.<br>
The present invention, an embodiment of which is shown in FIG. 3, solves this problem. A-support device 10 in accordance with the illustrated embodiment of the invention includes a rack chock 20 that is made of a steel rack plate .22 of the same thickness as the jacking rack JR.  The plate 22 includes on one edge thereof a series- of teeth 24 at a predetermined pitch that matches the pitch TP of the teeth JT on a first side of the jacking rack JR (shown in phantom in FIG. 3).  The rack chock 20 includes a support seat 26 on which the hull H of the platform P rests while the support device 10 is in use.  The seat is typically made of one or more steel plates 2" thick attached by welding, for example, to the top edge of the rack plate.  The rack chock 20 also includes a plurality of clamping arms 30 consisting of pipes or other suitable shapes made of an<br>
appropriate material such as steel. -Only three of the bracing arms  30a to ' 30c are shown in FIG. 3.  The fourth is "hidden" behind the rack plate, but is in a similar orientation to the arm 30a and located on me side of the rack plate 22 opposite the arm 30c.  One end of each bracing aim is welded to the steel rack plate 22 at an angle to the side surface of the plate as shown in FIG. 3. The distal end of each arm 30 is welded to "a mounting plate 34a to 34d, respectively.  The mounting plates 34a to 34d in the present embodiment made of steel plate 1" thick. Additional -rigidity is provided by gussets 36 welded in piace as shown hi FIG-. 3. Additional gussets may be used as n&amp;eded, depending on the platform's weight.<br>
The support device 10 further includes a clamping portion 50 that secures the rack chock 20 in place on the leg L.  In the present embodiment, the clamping portion .includes a first clamping bar 52 and a second clamping bar 54.  The clamping bars in the present embodiment are steel channels 1" thick, although other materials may he used. They are welded to 1" thick backing plates 55 and 56, respectively. Through holes are provided proximate to.each end of the clamping bars 52 and 54, and those b.oles align with complementary holes in the mounting plates 34a to 34d.   Bolts 60 passing through the holes secure the clamping bars 52 and 54 to the mounting plates. Bolt size is chosen in accordance with the weight of the platform.<br>
In use. a rack chock 20 is secured to each leg L under the platform P,. with the'support seat 26-  To accomplish this, the rack chock 20 is put in<br>
place with the rack teeth 22 meshed with the jacking teeth JT on the jacking rack JR. The mounting plates 34-a to 34d are bolted to their associated clamping bars 52 and 54 (and backing plates 55 and 56) as shown in FIG. 3. The length of the clamping arms 30 is such that the rack plate 22 can be drawn tightly against the first side of the jacking rack JR having the jacking teeth by drawing the clamping bars against the opposite, second side of the jacking rack JR.  This securely clamps the jacking rack between the rack plate and the clamping bars.  The platform P can then be lowered so that the hull rests on the seat plate 26-at the corner of each leg, and the jacks and brakes can be dismantled or otherwise made accessible for maintenance.  The rack chock 20 is located relative to the jacking rack 20 so that the required air gap is provided when the platform is lowered onto the seat plate 26.<br>
Once the maintenance is complete the jacks can be again placed in service platform raised above the seat plate 26.  This takes the load off of the supporting devices 10.  The bolts 60 are men removed and the devices 10 are dismantled and removed from the legs.<br>
"a"<br>
The support device 10 of this embodiment of the invention-has sufficient versatility to allow for variations in the level of the platform relative to  each leg.   That is, the hull H might hi fact be held at a different position relative to the leg at each corner of the platform.  This condition could, occur because it is necessary to make the platform level in. spite of variations in the seabed that can affect the distance to which each leg extends be-low the platform.  Such variations" can "be "accounted for with<br>
the support device 10 by in effect varying the thickness of the'support seat 26 and/or the length-of the rack plate 22.  A-convenient manner of making such an adjustment is by using a spacer 70, shown in phantom in FIG. 3, between the underside of the platform hull H and the top of the seat plate 26.  A similar approach could be talcen if the placement of the rack chock 20 with the seat 26 immediately adjacent to the floor would interfere with a mounting bracket MB holding the jacking rack JR. to the leg. . (See FIG. 2D.) In that case, a block- could be interposed between the hull and  the seat-26-.-<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention is particularly adapted for use with 'existing platforms that have no other provision for maintenance of the jacks, brakes and associated structure.  That is, there are platforms now in use in which the jacking system and brakes are the sole means of-supporting the platform on the legs.  The present invention permits the jacks, brakes and associated mechanisms of such platforms to be maintained without taking the platform out of sendee.  It should also be noted that the invention can be adapted for use with drilling, service, or maintenance platforms having alternate constructions.  For example, some platforms use legs with dual jacking racks.  Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the rack chock and other components of the embodiment discussed above can be adapted for use with such an<br>
arrangement.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to the foregoing embodiment, changes and variations may be made therein<br>
which fall within the scope of the appended claims.  Further changes and variations may be made thereto which, are within the scope of the appended claims.  All such modifications and/or changes are intended to be within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
