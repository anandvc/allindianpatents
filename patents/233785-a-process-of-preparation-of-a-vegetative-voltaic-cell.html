				<td>This invention relates to a vegetative voltaic cell.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A large and cheap source of energy is an essential requirement for the<br>
development of a growing nation. With the advancement of civilization the<br>
demand for energy sources has grown and the need for new sources of energy<br>
ecomes essential. At present, besides conventional energy sources, a constant<br>
quest for non-conventional energy has begun and researches in this area are in<br>
progress.<br>
Common voltaic cells use commercially available inorganic salts as electrolytes<br>
for power generation. Since all plant materials contain various types of inorganic<br>
and organic electrolytes absorbed through their root systems or synthesized<br>
through metabolic processes, it was the possibility of constructing a cheap<br>
vegetative voltaic cell was examined using commonly available plant materials.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a vegetative voltaic cell which is cost<br>
effective.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a vegetative voltaic cell which<br>
generates power from biological materials such as plant leaves.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a vegetative voltaic cell which is very<br>
simple and is free from environmental pollution.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is that the vegetative voltaic ceK can<br>
be re-used by Just changing the leaf slurry.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a vegetative voltaic cell.<br>
The vegetative voltaic cell of the present invention comprises of a slurry made up<br>
of the leaves of the plant as an electrolyte.<br>
The vegetative voltaic cell comprises of an insulated water proof container having<br>
plurality of chambers with electrolyte stored therein, a pluralty of electrodes<br>
disposed in the said electrolytes, said electrodes being positioned in each<br>
chamber through a lid of the container.<br>
A plurality of such cells are connected either In series or In parallel and the final<br>
output terminal passes through the outer surface of the lid.<br>
The slurry of the leaves is produced by using the leaves of any plant. The mature<br>
fresh leaves are ground with distilled water to make a slurry of 500 ml. Juicy<br>
fresh plant leaves or leaves of succulent plants with proper preservatives such as<br>
borax, Na-benzoate etc. give better results. The slurry Is then poured Into the<br>
chamber. Different types of plants are used. Some of which differ in their<br>
metabolic patterns. Thus, Bryophylum is a Crasulacean plant and Ns cell sap is<br>
acidic in nature due to dark fixation of CO2 at night, whereas the other plants do<br>
not have this type of metabolism. Consequently, it is expected that many other<br>
plants can be used conveniently depending on their electrolyte contents. The<br>
observed current may be considered as a short circuit current.<br>
There is no direct impact of light for such power generation since the same<br>
power is obtained in darkness. Electrolytes, oxidants and reductants present in<br>
plant organs, which participate in the complex biochemical reactions are<br>
apparently involved in the generation of power.<br>
DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Fig 1a &amp; 1b: Shows an insulated water proof box which is covered with a lid.<br>
Fig 2: Shows the series and parallel connections of the chambers in the box<br>
Fig 3: Shows the vegetative voltaic cell consists of two different types of<br>
electrodes.<br>
The electrodes are properly arranged in the fid of the cell. The lid carries<br>
electrodes for each of the chambers in the box with series and parallel<br>
connections and final output terminal passes through the outer surface of the lid.<br>
The vegetative voltaic cell consists of two different types of electrodes of different<br>
elements and the two electrodes with its chamber form a unit. One of the<br>
electrodes acts as anode and the other as cathode. Several different types of<br>
electrodes can be used. On combining a number of units in series and parallel a<br>
battery of cells of moderate power can be formed at any desired value as shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
As an examplary embodiment, the device shown in figure 2, has 12 chambers<br>
and the volume of each chamber is 50cm3. Carbon as cathode (7.5cm x 5.0 cm)<br>
and zinc as the anode (10.0 cm x 5.0 cm) gave good results. The carbon<br>
electrodes are placed at the center of each of the chamber on the lid and the zinc<br>
electrodes are fixed round the carbon electrodes leaving a space (0.5 cm) In<br>
between them.<br>
The power generated depends on the nature and condition of the leaves, size<br>
and nature of the electrodes and the type of combination of the units. A<br>
comparative account is given below.<br>
With the help of this, any low power-consuming circuit such as transistor radio,<br>
calculator, electronic wall clock, light-emitting diode etc. can be operated.<br>
The detail features of instant invention are as follows:<br>
(i) Unlike costly and complicated conventional cells using salt, acid or alkali, this<br>
device generates power from substances present in biological materials,<br>
especially from plant leaves.<br>
(ii) The device can generate power from leaves of any plant, including weeds.<br>
Any part of a plant such as the soft stem. root, fruit juice, leaf and algal<br>
material can be used for this purpose.<br>
(iii) The vegetative voltaic cell can be re-used by changing the leaf decocation.<br>
Again, by replacing any part of the device, it may further be repeatedly used.<br>
Here, the corrosive effect of the energy source is nominal, so the electrodes<br>
remain in good condition for a long duration. As the electrolytes are mostly<br>
weak organic ions, corrosion would be much less than in the case of strong<br>
electrolytes. One of the electrodes is carbon, which is not affected by<br>
corrosive action.<br>
(iv) The plant decocation was treated with Na-benzoate or borax to prevent<br>
microbial contamination.<br>
1. A process of preparation of a vegetative voltaic cell comprises of an insuIated<br>
water proof container having a plurality of chambers having electrolyte stored<br>
therein, with series and/or parallel connection, a plurality of electrodel disposed<br>
in said electrolyte and said electrodes are being positioned in each chamber<br>
through a lid of the container characterised in that substance's including oxidant<br>
and reductant present in plant organs in slurry which participate in the complex<br>
biochemical reactions are involved in the generation of power.<br>
2. A process of preparation of a vegetative voltaic cell as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein said cells are connected to each other voltaic either in series or parallel.<br>
3. A process of preparation of a vegetative voltaic cell as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein the said electrolyte is prepared from the nature fresh leaves comprising<br>
grinding the leaves with distilled water to make a slurry in process of<br>
preservations.<br>
4. A process of preparation of a vegetative voltaic cell as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein said preservations are selected from borax, Na-benzoate etc.<br>
5. A process of preparation of a vegetative voltaic cell as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein two different types of electrodes of different element are used.<br>
6. A process of preparation of a vegetative voltaic cell as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein one electrode acts as an anode and the other one act as a cathode.<br>
7. A process of preparation of a vegetative voltaic cell as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein preferably carbon is used as cathode and zinc as an anode.<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided a vegetative voltalc cell.<br>
The vegetative voltaic cell of the present invention comprises of a slurry made up<br>
of the leaves of the plant as an electrolyte.<br>
The vegetative voltalc cell comprises of an insulated water proof container having<br>
plurality of chambers with electrolyte stored therein, a plurality of electrodes<br>
disposed in the said electrolytes, said electrodes being positioned in each<br>
chamber through a lid of the container.<br>
A plurality of such cells are connected either in series or in parallel and the final<br>
output terminal passes through the outer surface or the lid.<br>
The slurry of the leaves is produced by using the leaves of any plant. The mature<br>
fresh leaves are ground with distilled water to make a slurry of 500 ml. Juicy<br>
fresh plant leaves or leaves of succulent plants with proper preservatives such as<br>
borax, Na-benzoate etc. give better results. The slurry is then poured into the<br>
chamber. Different types of plants are used. Some of which differ in their<br>
metabolic patterns. Thus, Bryophyllum is a Crasulacean plant and its cell sap is<br>
acidic in nature due to dark fixation of CO2 at hight, whereas the other plants do<br>
not have this type of metabolism. Consequently, it is expected that many other<br>
plants can be used conveniently depending on their electrolyte contents. The<br>
observed current may be considered as a short circuit current.<br>
There is no direct impact of light for such power generation since the same<br>
power is obtained in darkness. Electrolytes, oxidants and reductants present in<br>
plant organs, which participate in the complex biochemical reactions are<br>
apparently involved in the generation of power.<br></td>
