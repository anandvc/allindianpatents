				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a pressure stove which uses kerosene mixed with a chemical and burns like a LPG stove.<br>
At present pressure stove using kerosene consists of an oil tank of 2 litres and above and is fitted with a hand pump and a valve.<br>
The pressurized kerosene moves out of the tank through a vertical pipe with a provision for preheating for vaporising the pressured kerosene. The vertical pipe ends in a burner and at the end of the vertical pipe there is provided with a pin hole for discharge of high pressure vaporised kerosine into the burner where it burns with a short flame which is spread with a circular cast iron disc.<br>
There are disadvantages with the present system of pressure stove.<br>
One of the main disadvantage is that there is frequent carbon deposit at pin hole restricting the flow of fluid or gas. Every time the gas stove is lighted the pin hole requires to be very thoroughly cleaned with a specially made pin.<br>
Another disadvantages with the present pressure stove is that with only the pressure to vaporise or fluidize the kerosene is not enough for a complete combustion: Therefore its<br>
fuel efficiency is less than a LPG stove.<br>
2<br><br>
Yet another disadvantage with the present pressure<br>
stove is that preheating of fuel is done before lighting up the stove and there is no provision of preheating of fuel during running of the stove. Hence combustion is not complete with low thermal efficiency.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention<br><br>
is to provide a simple effective and a versatile <br>
pressure stove which produces a blue flame with better <br>
combustion and improved thermal efficiency like a LPG <br>
stove.<br>
 Another object of the present invention is to<br>
propose a pressure stove which uses kerosene oil mixed with chemical which has a 30% improved thermal efficiency<br>
compared to ordinary gas stove.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a pressure stove which does not require cleaning with a pin everytime the gas stove is lighted.<br>
Sti11 another objects of the present invention is to propose a pressure stove where the vaporised fuel is constantly preheated before it is being burnt in the burner for better thermal efficiency.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a pressure stove having a small container in the pipe line just before the burner to act as a buffer to maintain a uniform temperature and pressure of the vaporised fuel.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a pressure stove using kerosene mixed with a chemical comprising an oil tank with a pressure regulating valve and a hand pump at two ends of the said oil tank, a delivery pipe leading out of from inside the said tank to the other end of the stove and is interrupted , the<br>
said pipe is provided with a pin and jutting out centrally at one end of said pipe and a controller is provided at the other end of the said pipe to control the pin, a bent pipe aligned with the pipe leads to the burner and the said bent pipe is provided with a container for collection of vapor, wherein an electric heater is provided at the pipe for heating the fuel and the said pin atomises the fuel further and keeps the pin hole clean by controlling the pin with the controller and the pipe is disposed near the burner for radiation heating of fuel flowing through the pipe.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 _ Isometric view of the gas stove showing various components.<br>
FIG 2 - An isometric view of the oil tank detail with the delivery pipe.<br>
- 4<br><br>
Fig. 3 - A view of the tank with delivery pipe with the pin and the bent pipe with container and burner.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the gas pressure stove has some similarity with the existing type of pressure stove but delivery of oil under pressure and the burner (10) used is different. The proposed pressure stove does not require a separate ' pin' to clear the blockage, and to clear the blockage if arises due to carbon deposition is cleared with a pin (6) fitted at the end of liquid delivery pipe (5) as shown in Figs 2 &amp; 3. The tank (1 ) is provided with a valve (2) and pump (3) contains kerosene oil mixed with chemical for lightening and for blue flame. The pump (3) is used to pump air in the tank (1 ) to create a pressure on oil in the tank (1). The controller (4) mounted on pipe (5) controls the pin (3) to block and open the chemical oil passing through the delivery pipe (5). OPERATION<br>
In Fig. 3 it is shown that the delivery pipe (5) heated with an electrical heater (8) or by firing with kerosene oil or spirit and when it is ascertained that the pipe is heated and a pressure is created inside the oil tank it is then allowed to pass to the burner (10) to burn as a flame with the arrangement made in the stove. The flame is controlled with the valve (3) fitted with the tank (1).<br>
In this system first the chemical oil changes the character of the oil and is converted in the form of a vapour and pass through a very small hole and then pass through a bent pipe (7) connected with the burner<br><br>
(10). In this system 15 to 25% of oil will be saved compared with the existing stove. Similar savings upto 10 to 12% of Kerosene oil also be saved by using kerosene oil only comparing with the existing pressure stove or other kerosene oil stove available in the market.<br>
The chemical used is Toluene and dilute alcohol 90% v/v and mixed with kerosene oil in ratio of 25 gms/liter of kerosene oil<br>
The invention described in relation to a non-limiting embodiment and, as defined by the accompanying claims.<br>
