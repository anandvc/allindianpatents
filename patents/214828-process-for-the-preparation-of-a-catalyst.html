In particular, the process of the present invention is directed to the manufacture of a catalyst useful in propane ammoxidation.  The beauty of the process of the present invention is that it is a<br>
very simple procedure substantially eliminating the exotic<br>

many of the steps set forth in the previous procedures.  This, of course, leads to a more economical and commercially viable procedure for the preparation of the catalyst useful in propane and propylene ammoxidation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of preparing VaSbbOx based catalyst for the ammoxidation of hydrocarbons, particularly C3 to C5 alkanes and olefins to the corresponding alpha-beta unsaturated nitriles.  In particular, the present invention relates to the preparation of vanadium antimonate based catalysts for the ammoxidation of propane and propylene to acrylonitrile.  The process of the present invention comprises preparing a catalyst having the following empirical formula:<br><br>
where<br>
where<br><br>
a = 0.01 to 2<br>
b = 0.5 to 4<br>
m = 0.01 to 3, and<br>
n = 0 to 1<br>
M = Sn, Ti, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ga or mixtures thereof<br>
N = Li, Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Co, Ni, Zn, Ge, Nb, Zr,<br>
Mo, W, Cr, Te, Ta, Se, Bi, Ce, In, Ar, B<br>
or mixtures thereof<br><br><br>
comprising heating an aqueous mixture comprising water soluble vanadates (e.g. V04"3/ VOs'1, V2O5) and Sb203 and, optionally, at least one M promoter to a temperature of above the reflux temperature of the aqueous mixture to 250°C under autogenous pressure with agitation for a time sufficient to allow at least the slightly water soluble vanadates and Sb203 to react to form a catalyst precursor, drying the catalyst precursor to remove the water, and calcining the catalyst precursor to produce the finished catalyst.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process of the present invention, the M promoter is added to the aqueous mixture after the water soluble vanadates and Sb203 have been mixed and allowed to react.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, the process for the preparation of a VaSbbMmNnOx catalyst having the formula set forth above comprises heating an aqueous mixture comprising V205 and Sb2O3 to a temperature between 110° to 250°C under autogenous pressure with mixing for a time sufficient to allow the metal oxides to react to form a catalyst precursor, adding at least one M promoter to the aqueous mixture, drying the catalyst precursor to remove the water and calcining the catalyst precursor to produce the catalyst.<br>
The hydrothermal reaction of the metal oxides in the aqueous solution is continued for a time period sufficient for<br><br>
the metal oxides to suitably react to form the catalyst precursor.  The required reaction time is ultimately determined by the catalytic and physical properties of the final material obtained after calcination.  Typically, the reaction is continued for between 0.5 to 100 hrs, preferably from 1 to 50 hrs, especially preferred being 1 to 10 hrs.  It has been observed that shorter reaction times are required as one increases the temperature employed during the catalyst precursor formation.<br>
The aqueous mixture containing the vanadium and antimony components may also contain an acid or base, preferably a base present with the tin oxide sol.<br>
Any inorganic or organic acid may be employed for adjustment of the pH below 7.  It is more desirable to employ acids that can be decomposed during calcination such that they do not leave behind non-volatile components such as chloride, or sulfate that can modify the composition, unless that is desired.  Inorganic acids such as nitric acid can be employed, however these acids can evolve environmentally unacceptable gases such as NOX.  It is envisioned that the preferred acids are organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid or oxalic acid that decompose to produce COX  and water upon calcination.  The amount of acid that is employed in these syntheses is significantly below that which is required to<br>
dissolve all of the inorganic components, (e.g.  V205) prior to reaction.<br>
Any inorganic base (e.g. ammonium hydroxide)or organic amine (including diethoxyethylamine, tetramethylalkylammonium hydroxide, alkanolamines,t-butylammonium hydroxide) can be employed to adjust the pH above 7.  However, it is more desirable to employ bases that can be decomposed during calcination such that they do not leave behind non-volatile components such as the alkali or alkaline earth metals unless it is desired for them to be present in the final catalyst composition.  Suitable bases that can be employed are ammonium hydroxide and organic bases such as alkylamines and alkanolamines.  Most preferably, the base may already be present in the aqueous mixture as a stabilizer/dispersant for the hydrated inorganic metal oxide (e.g. tin oxide sol) which has been used as the raw material source for the M promoter during the formation of the catalyst precursor and, therefore, will not have to be added separately.<br>
The procedure of the present invention may comprise the reaction of the appropriate amounts of V205 and Sb203, (as well as optionally other metal oxides known to promote ammoxidation catalysis such as but not limited to those based upon tin oxide (sol), titanium, tellurium, rhenium, silicon, aluminum, iron, niobium, chromium, cobalt, copper, bismuth, tungsten, etc) in the presence of water and optionally an acid<br>
or base to adjust pH at a temperature of 100°C (reflux temperature) up to 250°C under autogenous pressure with vigorous stirring.  In cases where the promoter metal oxide itself cannot be made to react hydrothermally (or is not readily available in a suitable form), other sources of the metal promoters (e.g. nitrates, acetates, hydroxides, ammonium ion complexes, carbonyls, etc.) can optionally be employed. The hydrothermal reaction of these metal oxides is continued for a time period (typically 0.5 to 100 hrs) sufficient for the metal oxides to suitably disperse to form the catalyst precursor.  Some metal oxides or other sources may be added subsequent to the hydrothermal reaction step and can be in the form of fine metal powders, sols or complexes.  Examples of these are fumed TiOa, tin oxide sol, silica sol, and alumina sol.  Upon cooling, the material obtained (typically a fairly homogeneous slurry, although some segregation can occur if left standing without agitation) can be mixed/further reacted with additional metal oxides (or other metal sources such as nitrates, acetates, etc.), evaporated to dryness (or spray dried) and calcined in one or more steps to produce the final catalyst.  The pH of the hydrothermally prepared slurry may have to be adjusted prior to the addition of the other reagents for the optimal preparation of the catalyst.<br>
The required reaction time, temperature, solids content, and order of addition of other metal oxide reagents is<br>
ultimately determined by the catalytic and physical properties of the final material produced.  Further washing and calcination steps as utilized for catalysts prepared by other routes can also be employed to improve the performance of these catalysts.  For example, the washing and calcination steps disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,214,016, 5,008,427 and 5,258,543, herein incorporated by reference, may be utilized to improve the performance of the catalyst.  The addition of alkali such as lithium hydroxide to reduce the viscosity of the slurry prior to spray drying is also applicable to slurries prepared by this route.<br>
It has been found that the presence of the tin promoter in the form of tin oxide sol/stabilizers during the hydrothermal synthesis of promoted catalyst precursor is<br>
advantageous, especially at above reflux («100°C) to 250°C (e.g. 110° to 250°C), preferably 110° to 175°C, most preferred being 120° to 160°C, under autogenous pressure.<br>
In addition, the preparation of high solids content aqueous slurries are envisioned as particularly beneficial to the practice of the present invention.  The use of tetramethylammonium hydroxide stabilized Sn02 sol may be utilized to obtain aqueous slurries in the range of 70% solids which are suitable in the practice of the invention.<br>
Conducting the hydrothermal reaction step at elevated temperatures reduces the time needed to prepare slurries that<br>
ultimately yield catalysts that are as good or better than those prepared under reflux (approximately 100°C).  It is also felt that operation at elevated temperatures (temperatures above reflux, i.e. above 100°C) enhances the incorporation of other promoter elements into the base composition to improve overall performance. Moreover, the process of the present invention is readily scaleable for commercial catalyst manufacture because it is not necesary for all of the starting materials to be in solution at any one point in time. Therefore, higher solids concentrations of the slurries can be attained without the expense of concentration by, for example, evaporation prior to spray drying.  This increases the utilization efficiency of reactors and other equipment utilized in the preparation of catalyst.  The procedure of the present invention also reduces the amount of water that must be evaporated off of the slurry in order to attain the appropriate solids content for spray drying, thereby resulting in time and energy savings.<br>
It has also been observed that the rate of the reaction of the metal oxides under higher temperatures and autogenous pressure has been significantly enhanced by the presence of tin promoter in the form of a tin oxide sol.  In particular, the metal oxide reaction in the presence of tin oxide sol, i.e. Nalco 88-SN-123 and Nalco TX7684, supplied by the Nalco Chemical Co., Naperville, Illinois, is significantly enhanced.<br>
This permits the preparation of catalysts (precursors) using shorter reaction times and lower reaction temperatures than had been employed previously.<br>
There are qualitative factors that indicate that the presence of the tin oxide sol accelerates the rate of the reacton of vanadium and antimony oxides.  In the absence of the tin oxide sol, the color of the refluxed mixture does not darken appreciably (and yellow streaking is observed when a drop of slurry is placed on a piece of the filter paper indicative of free and soluble vanadium containing species) until after 3-6 hrs reaction time.  In the presence of tin oxide sol, the color is black within ~l/2 hr indicating substantial reaction.  XRD analysis of intermediate calcined materials (650°C) indicates that the tin oxide and titanium oxide are better dispersed if the tin oxide sol was present during the hydrothermal step.  The presence of organic stabilizers in the tin oxide sol can be detrimental to final catalyst performance unless special precautions are taken to remove the stabilizer before final calcination. Accordingly, there will be certain advantage to employing low levels of the stabilizer and or ones that volatilize readily.  The volatility of the stabilizer is not a problem during synthesis when using the process of the present invention which utilizes a sealed system at autogenous pressure.<br>
The most simple and convenient means of utilizing the procedure of the present invention under basic conditions is to have the tin sol, and accompanying stabilizers/dispersants, present during the hydrothermal reaction step of the vanadium and antimony oxides.  This could be an advantage with respect to minimizing migration of the tin oxide particles to the surface of particles formed during spray drying to prepare the catalyst in the fluid bed form.<br>
The following examples are set forth below for illustrative purposes only.<br>

Comparative Example 1<br>
A catalyst of composition VSbi.4Sn.2Ti.iOx was prepared in a similar manner as described in Example 9 above, except that no iron or Si02 was added.  The catalyst was ultimately<br>
calcined at 820°C for 3 hrs, calcined at 650°C for 3 hrs and washed with isobutanol.<br>
Example 2<br>
A catalyst  of composition    VSbi.4Sn.2Ti.iOx    was prepared in the   following manner:     7.58  g of    V205/   17.01  g of     Sb203 and 27.57  g of    NH4OH    stabilized    Sn02     sol  containing 2.51  g of    Sn02    and approximately 125 g of water were placed in a<br>
250 mL roundbottom flask equipped with a condenser.  This mixture was refluxed with stirring for 22 hrs.  After cooling, the obtained slurry was added to a beaker containing 0.67 g of fumed Ti02 with stirring.  After 1 hr, the slurry was concentrated by evaporation until the mixture thickened and<br>
placed in a 125°C oven overnight to dry.  The dried solid was heated in air at 290°C for 3 hrs, then 425°C for 3 hrs, and then 8 hrs at 650°C.  The material was then ground and sieved and a portion of the 20-35 mesh portion was calcined at 820°C for 3 hrs, then 650°C for 3 hrs and then washed with isobutanol.<br>
Example 3<br>
The same composition as set forth in Example 2 was prepared except that the fumed Ti02 was present during the 24 hrs reflux step.<br>
Example 4<br>
A catalyst of composition VSb^Sn^Ti.iOx was prepared in the following manner:<br>
7.58 g of V205, 17.01 g of  Sb203, 0.67 g of fumed Ti02, 27.57 g of an ammonium hydroxide stabilized Sn02  sol containing 2.51 g of Sn02  and approximately 125 g of water<br>
were placed in a quartz liner.  This liner was then placed and sealed inside a 300 cc autoclave equipped with an overhead<br>
stirrer.  The mixture was then heated to 125°C and maintained for 6 hrs with stirring.  The heater was then removed from the autoclave and the mixture was left to cool with stirring overnight.  The rest of the procedure was the same as for Examples 2 and 3.<br>
Example 5<br>
The same procedure as in Example 4 was utilized to prepare a slurry containing the components to prepare a catalyst of composition VSbi.4Sn.2Ti.iOx.  Upon removal from the cooled autoclave, the slurry was concentrated to 29-30% solids in a beaker on a hotplate.  Lithium hydroxide in water was added to reduce the viscosity of the slurry.  Water was continued to be evaporated off and a solids content of approximately 46% was obtained before the stir bar stopped. The rest of the procedure was similar to above except that the catalyst was calcined in flowing air at 810°C and 650°C prior to a single isobutanol washing step after the calcination at 650°C.  The resulting catalyst composition was Li.o5VSbi.4Sn2Ti.iOx.<br><br>
Example 6  (6 hrs)<br>
The same procedure was employed as in Example 4 except that the final two calcination steps were conducted as in Example 5.<br>
Example 7  (4 hrs)<br>
The same procedure was employed as in Example 6 except that the hydrothermal step was only conducted for 4 hrs.<br>
