				<td>Technical Field<br>
[0001.] The present invention relates to a process for producing<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated esters, which are important as intermediates for<br>
pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002.] It is known that a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated esters are important<br>
as intermediates for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals. There have been<br>
reported, as conventional production techniques relevant to the present invention,<br>
dehydration processes that use thionyl chloride (SOCl2), diphosphorus pentaoxide<br>
(P2O5), acetic anhydride [(CHaCO)2O] and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid<br>
anhydride [(CF3SO2)2O] as dehydrating agents (see Non-Patent Documents 1 to 6<br>
and Patent Document 1). Among others, the process using the<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid anhydride is applicable to even raw substrates in<br>
which the acidity of the (3-position proton is low (whereby the desired reaction is<br>
unlikely to proceed) and is thus regarded as one most superior process.<br>
[0003.] Further, the present applicant has disclosed a process of<br>
dehydroxyfluorination of an alcohol with the combined use of sulfuryl fluoride<br>
(SO2F2) and an organic base (see Patent Document 2).<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0006.] It is an object of the present invention to provide a practical production<br>
process of an a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester. In order to achieve the<br>
object of the present invention, it is necessary to solve problems in the prior art<br>
techniques.<br>
[0007.] The processes of Non-Patent Documents 1 to 6 are limited to<br>
applications where: the ß-proton of the raw substrate is high in acidity due to the<br>
presence of a neighboring electron attracting group; and a leaving group of the<br>
reaction intermediate (derived from a hydroxyl group of the raw substrate) can be<br>
readily eliminated by the electron pushing effect of the conjugated system. The<br>
applicable substrate ranges of the processes of Non-Patent Documents 1 to 6 are<br>
very narrow.<br>
[0008.] On the other hand, it is said that the process of Patent Document 1 has a<br>
wide applicable substrate range. There is however no disclosure in Patent<br>
Document 1 about the specific reaction conditions and yield in the case of using<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxyesters as raw substrates as in the case of the present<br>
invention. (It is merely stated in this patent document that the reaction is<br>
performed under conditions similar to those specified for typical reaction<br>
schemes.) Follow-up experiment has hence been conducted on the dehydration of<br>
the target substrate of the present invention, a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxyesters,<br>
under the suitable reaction conditions of Patent Document 1 (dehydrating agent:<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid anhydride, base: pyridine, reaction solvent:<br>
methylene chloride, temperature range: 0 to 35°C). The results of the follow-up<br>
experiment however show that the yield of the reaction is very low (see the<br>
after-mentioned Comparative Example 1 of TABLE 1 and Comparative Example 4<br>
of TABLE 2). The cause for such a low yield is a very slow rate of elimination<br>
from the reaction intermediate to the target product (see Scheme 1). Thus, it can<br>
hardly be said that the process of Patent Document 1 is practical for production of<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated esters.<br>
[0009.] [Chem. 1]<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
[0010.] Further, although the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid anhydride has two<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyl (CF3SO2) groups, only one of these<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyl groups is used for conversion to the leaving group of the<br>
reaction intermediate. It cannot be thus said that trifluoromethanesulfonic acid<br>
anhydride is a preferred dehydrating agent in view of the atom economy etc. It<br>
cannot also be said that the process using the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid<br>
anhydride is suitable for large-scale production of the target product as there occur<br>
as a by-product two molecules of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H), which<br>
is difficult to decompose and causes a problem in waste treatment, per 1 molecule<br>
of the target compound.<br>
[0011.] As mentioned above, there has been a demand for a practical production<br>
process applicable to a wide range of substrate materials and capable of producing<br>
an a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester with high yield in a short time (i.e. with<br>
high productivity) and with high reactant atom economy but without causing a<br>
problem in waste treatment.<br>
[0012.] The present inventors have made extensive researches in view of the<br>
above problems and, as a result, have found that it is possible to produce an<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester by reacting an<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester with sulfuryl fluoride in the presence of an<br>
organic base. The present inventors have also found that it is preferable that the<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester used as the raw substrate has a hydrogen atom<br>
as one P-position substituent group and either an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl<br>
group, an alkenyl group, a substituted alkenyl group, an aromatic ring group or a<br>
substituted aromatic ring group as the other P-position substituent group and is<br>
more preferable that an ester moiety of the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester is an<br>
alkyl ester. The above raw substrate is readily available. Further, the use of the<br>
above raw substrate is advantageous in that: the desired reaction proceeds<br>
favorably; and the resulting a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester is particularly<br>
important as a pharmaceutical and agricultural intermediate. The present<br>
inventors have further found that it is preferable to use either<br>
1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN) or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU) as the organic base. The use of the above organic base is advantageous in<br>
that the desired reaction proceeds more favorably.<br>
[0013.] The reaction conditions of the present invention are similar to the<br>
dehydroxyfluorination conditions of Patent Document 2. In fact, there could<br>
occur a fluoride by-product by replacement of an a-position hydroxyl group of the<br>
raw substrate with a fluorine atom (see Scheme-1; Example 1). It has however<br>
been shown that the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester can be obtained<br>
selectively as the dehydration product by the use of the<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester as the raw substrate in the present invention.<br>
[0014.] [Chem. 2]<br>
Scheme-1 (Example 1)<br><br>
[0015.] It has also been shown that, although trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride<br>
(CF3SO2F) and sulfuryl fluoride are expected to have the same effects as the<br>
reactant, the use of sulfuryl fluoride leads to a far superior conversion rate and GC<br>
purity to those by the use of trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride (see comparisons of<br>
Example 2 and Comparative Example 2 and of Example 3 and Comparative<br>
Example 3 in TABLE 1).<br>
[0016.] It has further been shown that, although the desired reaction proceeds<br>
favorably even with the use of triethylamine as the organic base, the use of<br>
1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene leads to a superior GG purity to that by the use<br>
of triethylamine (see comparison of Examples 2 and 3 in TABLE 1 and<br>
comparison of Examples 4 and 5 in TABLE 2); and it is particularly preferable to<br>
use the organic base stronger in basicity than triethylamine (more specifically, not<br>
only l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, but also 4-dimethylaminopyridine<br>
(DMAP), 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN),<br>
N,N,N',N',N"-pentamethylguanidine, l,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD),<br>
or phosphazene base such as BEMP or t-Bu-P4).<br>

[0019.] In this way, the present inventors have found the particularly useful<br>
techniques for production of the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester. The<br>
present invention is based on these findings.<br>
[0020.] Namely, the present invention provides a practical process for<br>
producing an a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester as defined as follows by<br>
Inventive Aspects 1 to 3.<br>
[0021.] [Inventive Aspect 1 ]<br>
A process for producing an a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester of<br>
the general formula [2], comprising: reacting an a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester<br>

configuration or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0022.] [Inventive Aspect 2]<br>
A process for producing an a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester of<br>

where R4 represents an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a<br>

group; R5 represents an alkyl group; the wavy line in the general formula [4]<br>
indicates that the double bond is in an E-isomer configuration, a Z-isomer<br>
configuration or a mixture thereof.<br>
[0023.] [Inventive Aspect 3]<br>
The process for producing the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester<br>

(DBU).<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0024.] The advantages of the present invention over the prior art techniques<br>
will be explained below.<br>
[0025.] The production process of the present invention is applicable to a wide<br>
range of substrate materials. Further, it is possible by the production process of<br>
the present invention that the target compound can be obtained with high<br>
productivity and high yield. It is also possible that the target compound can be<br>
obtained with high chemical purity as there occurs almost no difficult-to-separate<br>
by-product. The sulfuryl fluoride used in the present invention has high atom<br>
economy and can be easily processed into inorganic salts e.g. fluorite (CaF2) and<br>
calcium sulfate (CaSO4) that do not raise particular problems. In addition, the<br>
sulfuryl fluoride is widely used as a fumigant and available in a large quantity at<br>
low cost as compared to the other dehydrating agents such as<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic acid anhydride and fluorosulfuric acid anhydride<br>
((FSO2)2O) as disclosed in Patent Document 1.<br>
[0026.] As mentioned above, the production process of the present invention<br>
solves all of the prior art problems and can be applied for industrial uses. So far<br>
as the present inventors know, there has been no report about organic synthesis<br>
example using, as a dehydrating agent, sulfuryl fluoride that is widely known and<br>
used as the fumigant.<br>
[0027.] The production process of the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester<br>
according to the present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
[0028.] According to the present invention, an<br>
a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester of the general formula [2] is produced by<br>
reaction of an a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the general formula [1] with<br>
sulfuryl fluoride in the presence of an organic base.<br>
[0029.] In the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the general formula [1], R1<br>
and R each independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a<br>
substituted alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a substituted alkenyl group, an alkynyl<br>
group, a substituted alkynyl group, an aromatic ring group, a substituted aromatic<br>
ring group, an alkylcarbonyl group, a substituted alkylcarbonyl group, an<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group, a substituted alkoxycarbonyl group, an arylcarbonyl group,<br>
a substituted arylcarbonyl group, a cyano group or a nitro group. Among others,<br>
a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a<br>
substituted alkenyl group, an aromatic ring group and a substituted aromatic ring<br>
group are preferred as R and R . It is more preferred that one of R and R is a<br>
hydrogen atom and the other of R1 and R2 is either an alkyl group, a substituted<br>
alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a substituted alkenyl group, an aromatic ring group<br>
or a substituted aromatic ring group.<br>
[0030.] Herein, the alkyl group generally has 1 to 18 carbon atoms and can be in<br>
the form of a linear or branched structure, or a cyclic structure (in the case of 3 or<br>
more carbon atoms). The alkenyl group refers to that in which any number of<br>
single bonds between any two adjacent carbon atoms of the above alkyl group has<br>
been replaced with a double bond. In this case, the double bond can be in an<br>
E-isomer configuration, a Z-isomer configuration or a mixture thereof. The<br>
alkynyl group refers to that in which any number of single bonds between any two<br>
adjacent carbon atoms of the above alkyl group has been replaced with a triple<br>
bond. The aromatic ring group generally has 1 to 18 carbon atoms and can be an<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon group such as phenyl, naphthyl or anthryl, or an aromatic<br>
heterocyclic group containing a hetero atom e.g. a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom<br>
or a sulfur atom, such as pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, indolyl, benzofuryl or<br>
benzothienyl. The alkyl moiety (R) of the alkylcarbonyl group (-COR) is the<br>
same as the above alkyl group. The alkyl moiety (R) of the alkoxycarbonyl group<br>
(-CO2R) is also the same as the above alkyl group. The aryl moiety (Ar) of the<br>
arylcarbonyl group (-COAr) is the same as the above aromatic ring group.<br>
[0031.] Any of the carbon atoms of the alkyl group, the alkenyl group, the<br>
alkynyl group, the aromatic ring group, the alkylcarbonyl group, the<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group and the arylcarbonyl group may be replaced with any<br>
number of and any combination of substituents (which correspond to the<br>
substituted alkyl group, the substituted alkenyl group, the substituted alkynyl group,<br>
the substituted aromatic ring group, the substituted alkylcarbonyl group, the<br>
substituted alkoxycarbonyl group and the substituted arylcarbonyl group,<br>
respectively). Examples of such substituents are: halogen atoms such as fluorine,<br>
chlorine, bromine and iodine; azide group; nitro group; lower alkyl groups such as<br>
methyl, ethyl and propyl; lower haloalkyl groups such as fiuoromethyl,<br>
chloromethyl and bromomethyl; lower alkoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy and<br>
propoxy; lower haloalkoxy groups such as fluoromethoxy, chloromethoxy and<br>
bromomethoxy; lower alkylamino groups such as dimethylamino, diethylamino<br>
and dipropylamino; lower alkylthio groups such as methylthio, ethylthio and<br>
propylthio; cyano group; lower alkoxycarbonyl groups such as methoxycarbonyl,<br>
ethoxycarbonyl and propoxycarbonyl; aminocarbonyl (CONH2); lower<br>
alkylaminocarbonyl groups such as dimethylaminocarbonyl, diethylaminocarbonyl<br>
and dipropylaminocarbonyl; unsaturated groups such as alkenyl groups and<br>
alkynyl groups; aromatic ring groups such as phenyl, naphthyl, pyrrolyl, furyl and<br>
thienyl; aromatic ring oxy groups such as phenoxy, naphthoxy, pyrrolyloxy,<br>
furyloxy and thienyloxy; aliphatic heterocyclic groups such as piperidyl, piperidino<br>
and morpholinyl; hydroxyl group; protected hydroxyl groups; amino group<br>
(including amino acids and peptide residues); protected amino groups; thiol group;<br>
protected thiol groups; aldehyde group; protected aldehyde groups; carboxyl<br>
group; and protected carboxyl groups.<br>
[0032.] The following terms are herein defined by the following meanings in<br>
the present specification. The term "lower" means that the group to which the<br>
term is attached has 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the form of a linear structure, a<br>
branched structure or a cyclic structure (in the case of 3 carbons or more). It<br>
means that, when the "unsaturated group" is a double bond (alkenyl group), the<br>
double bond can be in an E-isomer configuration, a Z-isomer configuration or a<br>
mixture thereof. It means that the "protected hydroxyl, amino, thiol, aldehyde<br>
and carboxyl groups" may be those having protecting groups as described in<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Third Edition, 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
Inc. (In this case, two or more functional groups may be protected with one<br>
protecting group.) Further, the "unsaturated group", "aromatic ring group",<br>
"aromatic ring oxy group" and "aliphatic heterocyclic group" may be substituted<br>
with halogen atoms, azide group, nitro group, lower alkyl groups, lower haloalkyl<br>
groups, lower alkoxy groups, lower haloalkoxy groups, lower alkylamino groups,<br>
lower alkylthio groups, cyano group, lower alkoxycarbonyl groups, aminocarbonyl<br>
group, lower aminocarbonyl groups, hydroxyl group, protected hydroxyl groups,<br>
amino group, protected amino groups, thiol group, protected thiol groups, aldehyde<br>
group, protected aldehyde groups, carboxyl group or protected carboxyl groups.<br>
Although some of these substituent groups could react with sulfuryl fluoride in the<br>
presence of the organic base, the desired reaction can be promoted favorably by<br>
adoption of the suitable reaction conditions.<br>
[0033.] In the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the general formula [1], R<br>
represents an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group. Among others, an alkyl<br>
group is preferred as R . Particularly preferred as R is a lower alkyl group.<br>
[0034.] Examples of the alkyl group and substituted alkyl group usable as R3<br>
are the same as those mentioned above as R and R .<br>
[0035.] The a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the general formula [1] can<br>
be prepared with reference to, for example, Tetrahedron (U.K.), 2002, Vol. 58, P.<br>
8565-8571 or Tetrahedron Letters (U.K.), 2004, Vol. 45, P. 183-185.<br>
[0036.] It suffices to use the sulfuryl fluoride in an amount of 0.7 mol or more<br>
per 1 mol of the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the general formula [1].<br>
The amount of the sulfuryl fluoride used is generally preferably 0.8 to 10 mol,<br>
more preferably 0.9 to 5 mol, per 1 mol of the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester<br>
of the general formula [1].<br>
[0037.] Examples of the organic base are triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine,<br>
tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tri-n-pentylamine, pyridine, 2,3-lutidine,<br>
2,4-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine, 3,4-lutidine, 3,5-lutidine, 2,4,6-collidine, 3,5,6-collidine,<br>
4-dimethy laminopyridine, 1,5 -diazabicy clo [4.3.0] non- 5 -ene,<br>
1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, N,N,N',N',N"-pentamethylguanidine,<br>
1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene, and phosphazene bases such as BEMP and<br>
t-Bu-P4. Among others, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, tri-n-butylamine,<br>
pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, 2,4,6-collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine,<br>
1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene are<br>
preferred as the organic base. Particularly preferred as the organic base are<br>
triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene and<br>
1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene. The above organic bases can be used solely<br>
or in combination thereof.<br>
[0038.] It suffices to use the organic base in an amount of 0.7 mol or more per 1<br>
mol of the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the general formula [1]. The<br>
amount of the organic base used is generally preferably 0.8 to 10 mol, more<br>
preferably 0.9 to 5 mol, per 1 mol of the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the<br>
general formula [1]. In the case of using two or more kinds of organic base<br>
materials in combination, the amount of the organic base used refers to the total<br>
amount of the organic base materials. Either one of the organic base materials<br>
stronger in basicity may be used in a catalytic amount (see Examples 5 to 7).<br>
[0039.] Examples of the reaction solvent are: aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents<br>
such as n-hexane, cyclohexane and n-heptane; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such<br>
as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as<br>
methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane; ether solvents such as<br>
diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, diisopropyl ether and tert-butyl methyl ether; ester<br>
solvents such as ethyl acetate and n-butyl acetate; nitrile solvents such as<br>
acetonitrile and propionitrile; amide solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylacetoamide and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone; and dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide. Among others, n-hexane, n-heptane, toluene, xylene, methylene<br>
chloride, tetrahydrofuran, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, ethyl acetate,<br>
acetonitrile, propionitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide are<br>
preferred as the reaction solvent. Particularly preferred as the reaction solvent are<br>
n-heptane, toluene, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, tert-butyl methyl ether,<br>
ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and N,N-dimethylformamide. The above reaction<br>
solvents can be used solely or in combination thereof. In the present invention,<br>
the reaction may alternatively be conducted in the absence of the reaction solvent.<br>
[0040.] It suffices to use the reaction solvent in an amount of 0.01 L (liter) or<br>
more per 1 mol of the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the general formula [1].<br>
The amount of the reaction solvent used is generally preferably 0.03 to 30 1, more<br>
preferably 0.05 to 20 1, per 1 mol of the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of the<br>
general formula [1].<br>
[0041.] It suffices that the reaction temperature is in the range of -30 to +150°C.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally preferably -20 to +140°C, more preferably<br>
-10 to + 130°C.<br>
[0042.] Further, it suffices that the reaction time is 24 hours or less. As the<br>
reaction time depends on the raw substrate and the reaction conditions, it is<br>
preferable to determine the time at which the raw substrate has almost disappeared<br>
as the end of the reaction while monitoring the progress of the reaction by any<br>
analytical means such as gas chromatography, liquid chromatography or nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance.<br>
[0043.] The a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester of the general formula [2]<br>
can be obtained as a crude product by post treatment of the reaction terminated<br>
liquid. As one example of post treatment operation, it is feasible to dilute the<br>
reaction terminated liquid (if necessary, after concentrating the reaction terminated<br>
liquid by evaporation of the reaction solvent) with an organic solvent (such as<br>
n-hexane, n-heptane, toluene, xylene, methylene chloride, diisopropyl ether,<br>
tert-butyl methyl ether or ethyl acetate), wash the diluted liquid with water or an<br>
aqueous solution of an alkali metal inorganic base (such as sodium<br>
hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium<br>
carbonate) (and, if necessary, dry the organic phase with a drying agent such as<br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate or anhydrous magnesium sulfate), and then, concentrate<br>
the recovered organic phase. The crude product can also be obtained by directly<br>
subjecting the reaction terminated liquid to distillation under reduced pressure for<br>
simplification of the post treatment operation. Further, the crude product can be<br>
purified to a high chemical purity, as needed, by purification operation such as<br>
activated carbon treatment, distillation, recrystallization or column chromatography.<br>
Herein, the wavy line in the general formula (2) indicates that the double bond of<br>
the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester is in an E-isomer configuration, a<br>
Z-isomer configuration or a mixture thereof.; and the stereochemistry of the target<br>
product varies depending on the raw substrate and the reaction conditions.<br>
[0044.] As described above, the a-trifluoromethyl-a,(3-unsaturated ester is<br>
produced by reaction of the a-trifiuoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester with sulfuryl<br>
fluoride in the presence of the organic base (Inventive Aspect 1).<br>
[0045.] In Inventive Aspect 1, it is preferable to use the raw substrate having a<br>
hydrogen atom as one P-position substituent group and either an alkyl group, a<br>
substituted alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a substituted alkenyl group, an aromatic<br>
ring group or a substituted aromatic ring group as the other P-position substituent<br>
group and whose ester moiety is an alkyl ester (Inventive Aspect 2). This<br>
preferred raw substrate is readily available. Further, the use of this preferred raw<br>
substrate is advantageous in that: the desired reaction proceeds favorably; and the<br>
resulting a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester is particularly important as a<br>
pharmaceutical and agricultural intermediate.<br>
[0046.] It is further preferable in Inventive Aspects 1 and 2 to use either 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN) or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU) as the organic base (Inventive Aspect 3). The desired reaction can be<br>
promoted more favorably by the use of this preferred organic base.<br>

WE CLAIM<br>
1. A process for producing an a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester of<br>
the general formula [2], comprising: reacting an a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester<br>
of the general formula [1] with sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) in the presence of an<br>
organic base<br><br>
where R1 and R2 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a<br>
substituted alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a substituted alkenyl group, an alkynyl<br>
group, a substituted alkynyl group, an aromatic ring group, a substituted aromatic<br>
ring group, an alkylcarbonyl group, a substituted alkylcarbonyl group, an<br>
alkoxycarbonyl group, a substituted alkoxycarbonyl group, an arylcarbonyl group,<br>
a substituted arylcarbonyl group, a cyano group or a nitro group; R3 represents an<br>
alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group; and the wavy line in the general formula<br>
(2) indicates that the double bond is in an E-isomer configuration, a Z-isomer<br>
configuration or a mixture thereof.<br>
2. The process for producing the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester<br>
of the as claimed in claim 1, wherein the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester is<br>
an a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester of the general formula [4]; and wherein<br>
the a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester is an a-trifluoromethyl-a-hydroxy ester of<br>
the general formula [3]<br><br>
where R4 represents an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a<br>
substituted alkenyl group, an aromatic ring group or a substituted aromatic ring<br>
group; R5 represents an alkyl group; the wavy line in the general formula [4]<br>
indicates that the double bond is in an E-isomer configuration, a Z-isomer<br>
configuration or a mixture thereof.<br>
3. The process for producing the a-trifluoromethyl-a,ß-unsaturated ester<br>
according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the organic base is either<br>
1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN) or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU).<br><br>
An α-trifluoromethyl-α,β-unsaturated ester can be produced by reacting<br>
an α-trifluoromethyl-α-hydroxy ester with sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) in the<br>
presence of an organic base. It is preferable that the raw substrate has a hydrogen<br>
atom as one β-position substituent group and either an alkyl group, a substituted<br>
alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a substituted alkenyl group, an aromatic ring group<br>
or a substituted aromatic ring group as the other β-position substituent group. It<br>
is more preferable that an ester moiety of the raw substrate is an alkyl ester. This<br>
raw substrate is readily available. Further, the desired reaction can proceed<br>
favorably with the use of this raw substrate. It is also preferable to use either<br>
1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN) or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene<br>
(DBU) as the organic base. The desired reaction can proceed more favorably<br>
with the use of this organic base.</td>
