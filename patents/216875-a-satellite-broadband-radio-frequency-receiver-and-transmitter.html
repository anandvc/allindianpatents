				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a radiofrequency<br>
transmitter and/or receiver. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to satellite broadcasting devices.<br>
Satellite broadcasting has many advantages over<br>
radio transmission called "terrestrial" broadcasting.<br>
Among the advantages, mention may be made of the direct<br>
visibility between transmitter and receiver, the<br>
absence of echoes and, above all, a broad band of<br>
frequencies that can be used.<br>
The success of satellite broadcasting has had<br>
the effect of gradually saturating the spectrum of<br>
available frequencies. It is necessary to use ever<br>
higher frequencies with ever broader bandwidths. At the<br>
present time, a satellite broadcasts over several<br>
carriers lying within the same frequency band. As an<br>
example, a satellite television receiver may, for<br>
example, receive 20 channels lying between 11.7 GHz and<br>
12.1 GHz.<br>
Figure 1 shows an example of a satellite<br>
receiver of a conventional type which comprises a<br>
receiving block labelled LNB (Low Noise Block), mounted<br>
for example at the focus of a parabolic dish, and an<br>
internal unit labelled TUNER. The LNB receiving block<br>
comprises an antenna 1 followed by a low-noise<br>
amplifier 2. The signal delivered by the amplifier 2 is<br>
transposed to an intermediate frequency by means of a<br>
mixer 3 and an oscillator 4. The signal transmitted<br>
from the LNB receiving block to the TUNER internal unit<br>
has a working bandwidth lying around 1 to 2 GHz.<br>
The TUNER internal unit comprises a first band-<br>
pass filter 5 which lets through only the signal of the<br>
working bandwidth coming from the LNB block. A<br>
frequency synthesizer 6, consisting for example of a<br>
voltage-controlled oscillator 7 and a phase-locked loop<br>
8, delivers a tuning signal which allows a mixer 9 to<br>
frequency-transpose the working bandwidth so that a<br>
channel selected from this bandwidth lies around a<br><br>
predefined intermediate frequency. A second, more<br>
selective, filter 10 removes the other channels present<br>
in the working bandwidth. A mixer 11 coupled to a local<br>
oscillator 12 transposes the selected channel from the<br>
intermediate frequency to the baseband.<br>
To achieve high-datarate transmission, the<br>
channels may be less broad than for television image<br>
broadcasting, that is to say between 5 and 50 MHz, but<br>
must be more numerous as the information is customized<br>
by each user. If one is in the Ka band, the frequency<br>
assignment made by the various standardization<br>
organizations defines the various frequencies that can<br>
be used, which are sometimes non-contiguous.<br>
To obtain the desired bandwidth, it may be<br>
necessary to use non-contiguous bands in order to have<br>
a very broad bandwidth. As an example, it is possible<br>
to have a band consisting of two sub-bands, for example<br>
between 18.3 and 18.8 GHz and between 19.7 and 20.2 GHz<br>
separated by a forbidden band 900 MHz in width. The<br>
working bandwidth is then spread out over 1.9 GHz.<br>
The use of a conventional device such as that<br>
in Figure 1 is not possible for many reasons. Among<br>
others, the frequency synthesizer 6 would have to<br>
operate over a 1.9 GHz range. Unfortunately, it is very<br>
difficult to produce such a synthesizer using current<br>
means. The problem is solved for satellite television<br>
receivers by using several LNB blocks which bring the<br>
various bands down to a single intermediate frequency<br>
range or by using several TUNER units which operate at<br>
various frequency ranges.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
simple solution for a broadband receiver whose received<br>
working bandwidth is split into at least two non-<br>
contiguous sub-bands.<br>
The invention is a radiofrequency receiver<br>
comprising radiowave receiving means which convert an<br>
electromagnetic wave into a first signal, a first mixer<br>
which converts the first signal into a second signal by<br>
a fixed frequency transposition, a filtering means<br><br>
which converts the second signal into a third signal by<br>
selecting part of the spectrum of the said second<br>
signal and a second mixer which converts the third<br>
signal into a fourth signal by frequency transposition<br>
by means of a transposition signal coming from a<br>
frequency synthesizer. The filtering means comprises at<br>
least two band-pass filters of split bandwidths<br>
provided with switching means which make it possible to<br>
select only one of the filters.<br>
The use of two switched filters makes it<br>
possible to use a single synthesizer to scan the at<br>
least two sub-bands of the working bandwidth. According<br>
to the invention, the frequency synthesizer operates<br>
for one sub-band in supradyne mode and for the other<br>
sub-band in infradyne mode.<br>
According to one particular embodiment, the<br>
invention uses a third filter and divides the bandwidth<br>
into three sub-bands.<br>
It is also an object of the invention, in order<br>
to be able to produce a two-way transmission device, to<br>
provide a similar solution for the transmitters which<br>
are optionally coupled to the receivers.<br>
Thus, the subject of the invention is also a<br>
radiofrequency transmitter comprising a first mixer<br>
which converts a first signal into a second signal by<br>
frequency transposition by means of a transposition<br>
signal coming from a frequency synthesizer, a filtering<br>
means which converts the second signal into a third<br>
signal by selecting part of the spectrum of the said<br>
second signal, a second mixer which converts the third<br>
signal into a fourth signal by a fixed frequency<br>
transposition and radiowave transmission means which<br>
convert the fourth signal into an electromagnetic wave.<br>
The filtering means comprises at least two band-pass<br>
filters of split bandwidths provided with switching<br>
means which make it possible to select only one of the<br>
filters.<br>
The invention will be more clearly understood,<br>
and further features and advantages will appear on<br><br>
reading the following description, the description<br>
referring to the appended drawings in which:<br>
- Figure 1 shows a satellite receiver according<br>
to the prior art;<br>
Figure 2 shows a first embodiment of a<br>
satellite receiver according to the invention;<br>
Figure 3 shows a first embodiment of a<br>
satellite transmitter according to the invention;<br>
Figure 4 shows signal spectra used in the<br>
receiver of Figure 2;<br>
Figure 5 shows a second embodiment of a<br>
satellite receiver according to the invention;<br>
- Figure 6 shows a second embodiment of a<br>
satellite transmitter according to the invention; and<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show signal spectra used in the<br>
receiver of Figure 5.<br>
To simplify the drawings and allow a person<br>
skilled in the art to better appreciate the differences<br>
between the invention and the prior art, the same<br>
references have been used for identical or very similar<br>
components.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first embodiment of a<br>
satellite receiver according to the invention. To make<br>
the operation of the receiver more clearly understood,<br>
reference should also be made to Figure 4. This<br>
receiver operates within a high frequency range, for<br>
example the Ka band, and it has a bandwidth spread out<br>
 over a spectral width w (Fig. 4a) with, for example, w<br>
equal to 1.9 GHz and lying between 18.3 and 20.2 GHz.<br>
The working part of the bandwidth is split into two<br>
sub-bands B1 and B2 (Fig. 4a) which have, for example,<br>
the same width, namely 500 MHz and are located between<br>
18.3 and 18.8 GHz and between 19.7 and 20.2 GHz. The<br>
receiver comprises an LNB receiving block, mounted for<br>
example at the focus of a parabolic dish, and a TUNER<br>
internal unit.<br>
The LNB block, of conventional structure,<br>
includes an antenna 1 followed by a low-noise amplifier<br>
2. The signal delivered by the amplifier 2 is<br><br>
transposed to an intermediate frequency by means of a<br>
mixer 3 and an oscillator 4. The oscillator 4 delivers<br>
a signal of frequency Fosc, for example equal to<br>
21.5 GHz, which makes it possible to obtain a signal<br>
output by the LNB block having the same spectral width<br>
w but transposed to a frequency more favourable to<br>
transmission over a coaxial cable. As an example, the<br>
signal transmitted to the TUNER unit is between 1.3 and<br>
3.2 GHz.<br>
The TUNER unit differs from the prior art by<br>
the use of filtering means 50, placed at the input,<br>
which receive the signal from the LNB block. The<br>
filtering means 50 comprise two filters 51 and 52<br>
connected in parallel via switching means 53 and 54.<br>
The filters 51 and 52 are band-pass filters which let<br>
through the image bands B"1 and B"2 (Fig. 4b) of the<br>
sub-bands B1 and B2, respectively, after Fosc frequency<br>
transposition. The bands B"l and B"2 correspond, for<br>
example, to the 1.3 to 1.8 GHz and 2.7 to 3.2 GHz<br>
bands. The switching means 53 and 54 are electronic<br>
switches controlled by a manual selector or by a<br>
control circuit (not shown) . When it is desired to use<br>
the sub-band Bl, all that is required is to position<br>
the switching means 53 and 54 so as to connect the<br>
filter 51 between the input and the output of the<br>
filtering means 50, so that, at the output of the<br>
filtering means, the spectrum of the working signal<br>
corresponds only to B"l, the band B"2 being suppressed.<br>
When it is desired to use the sub-band B2, all that is<br>
required is to position the switching means 53 and 54<br>
so as to connect the filter 52 between the input and<br>
the output of the filtering means 50, so that, at the<br>
output of the filtering means, the spectrum of the<br>
working signal corresponds only to B"2, the band B"l<br>
being suppressed.<br>
A frequency synthesizer 6, consisting for<br>
example of a voltage-controlled oscillator 7 and a<br>
phase-locked loop 8, delivers a tuning signal which<br>
allows a mixer 9 to transpose the band selected B"l or<br><br>
B"2. The tuning signal corresponds to a signal of<br>
frequency Fvco (Fig. 4b) which varies within a range<br>
having the same width as the width of the bands B"1 and<br>
B"2. Depending on the filter selected, the tuning<br>
signal either transposes the band B"l or transposes the<br>
band B"2, the resulting band being either B"l (Fig. 4d)<br>
or B"2 (Fig. 4c) . The resulting band B"l or B"2 is<br>
placed within the frequency spectrum by the tuning<br>
frequency Fvco so that a channel selected from the<br>
resulting band lies near an intermediate frequency FIo<br>
(Fig. 4c and 4d), for example equal to 700 MHz. Figures<br>
4c and 4d show by the solid line the resulting bands<br>
B"l or B"2 which correspond to the signal of frequency<br>
Fvco represented by the solid line in Figure 4b. The<br>
resulting bands B"l or B"2 corresponding to the signal<br>
of frequency Fvco represented by the dotted lines in<br>
Figure 4b are shown by the dotted lines in Figures 4c<br>
and 4d.<br>
A filter 10, of the band-pass type, removes the<br>
unselected channels from the resulting band B"l or B"2.<br>
The filter 10 is a band-pass filter with a high<br>
attenuation, a cut-off frequency of which corresponds<br>
to the intermediate frequency FIo and the width of<br>
which corresponds to the spectral occupancy of a<br>
channel, for example 5 MHz. A mixer 11 coupled to a<br>
local oscillator 12 transposes the selected channel<br>
into a base band.<br>
Figure 3 shows a first embodiment of a<br>
transmitter according to the invention. This<br>
transmitter operates in the same frequency bands as the<br>
receiver in Figure 2. The transmitter consists overall<br>
of the same components as the receiver, but it is<br>
distinguished from the receiver by a reversal in the<br>
direction of the signal and the replacement of the<br>
amplifier 2 with a transmission amplifier 2b.<br>
In the examples described above, the passbands<br>
of the two filters 51 and 52 and the range of variation<br>
in the frequency of the tuning signal Fvco are of the<br>
same width, which also means that the range of<br><br>
variation in the frequency of the tuning signal Fvco is<br>
centred between the two passbands. However, if the two<br>
available sub-bands B1 and B2 do not have the same<br>
width, it is appropriate not to have two filters having<br>
the same passband. Likewise, the range of frequency-<br>
variation of the tuning signal Fyco must be adapted in<br>
order to be able to scan the broadest bandwidth.<br>
However, if the imbalance between the two sub-<br>
bands B1 and B2 is too great and the separation between<br>
the sub-bands is too small, it becomes impossible to<br>
use the first embodiment of the invention. A second<br>
receiver embodiment is shown in Figure 5. In order for<br>
the operation of the receiver to be more clearly<br>
understood, reference will be made to both Figure 5 and<br>
Figure 7.<br>
This receiver operates in a high frequency<br>
range, for example the Ka band, and it has a bandwidth<br>
spread out over a spectral width w (Fig. 7a), with, for<br>
example, w equal to 1.75 GHz and lying between 28.35<br>
and 30.1 GHz. The working part of the bandwidth is<br>
split into two sub-bands Bl and B2 (Fig. 7a) which<br>
have, for example, a width of 250 MHz between 28.35 and<br>
28.6 GHz and a width of 750 MHz between 29.25 and<br>
30.1 GHz. The receiver comprises an LNB receiving<br>
block, mounted for example at the focus of a parabolic<br>
dish, and a TUNER internal unit.<br>
The LNB block, of conventional structure,<br>
comprises an antenna 1, a low-noise amplifier 2, a<br>
mixer 3 and an oscillator 4. The oscillator 4 delivers<br>
a signal of frequency Fosc (Fig. 7a) , for example equal<br>
to 27.6 GHz. The operation of the LNB block is similar<br>
to the LNB block in Figure 2. However, in this example,<br>
since the frequencies are different, the signal<br>
transmitted to the TUNER unit is between 0.75 and<br>
2.5 GHz.<br>
The TUNER unit comprises filtering means 50b, a<br>
synthesizer 6, two mixers 9 and 11, a filter 10 and a<br>
local oscillator 12. The filtering means 50b are<br>
located at the input and receive the signal from the<br><br>
LNB block. The filtering means 50b comprise three<br>
filters 51b, 52b and 55b connected in parallel via<br>
switching means 53b and 54b. The filters 51b, 52b and<br>
55b are band-pass filters which let through the image<br>
bands B"1 and B"2a and B"2b (Fig. 7b) of the sub-bands<br>
B1 and B2, respectively, after transposition of a<br>
frequency Fosc. In this example, the image of the sub-<br>
band B2 is split into two bands B"2a and B"2b, one<br>
having the same width as the band B"1 and the other<br>
having twice the width. The bands B"1 and B"2a and B"2b<br>
correspond, for example, to the 0.75 to 1 GHz, 1.75 to<br>
2 GHz and 2 to 2.5 GHz bands. The switching means 53b<br>
and 54b are electronic switches controlled by a manual<br>
selector or by a control circuit (not shown)<br>
When it is desired to use the sub-band Bl, all<br>
that is required is to position the switching means 53b<br>
and 54b so as to connect the filter 51b between the<br>
input and the output of the filtering means 50b so<br>
that, at the output of the filtering means, the<br>
spectrum of the working signal corresponds only to B"1,<br>
the bands B"2a and B"2b being suppressed. When it is<br>
desired to use the sub-band B2, either the filter 52b<br>
or the filter 55b is used, depending on whether the<br>
channel to be selected lies in the band B"2a or in the<br>
band B"2b.<br>
The frequency synthesizer 6 comprises, in this<br>
example, a voltage-controlled oscillator 7, coupled to<br>
a phase-locked loop 8, but also a switch 61 and a<br>
frequency doubler 62. The doubler 62 is connected to<br>
the output of the voltage-controlled oscillator so that<br>
the signal output by the doubler 62 always delivers a<br>
signal at twice the frequency. The switch 61 is coupled<br>
to the switching means 53b and 54b so that the<br>
synthesizer 6 delivers the signal from the doubler 62<br>
when the filter 55b corresponding to the double width<br>
band is selected. If one of the other filters, 51b or<br>
52b, is selected then the synthesizer delivers the<br>
tuning signal from the oscillator 7. The tuning signal<br>
corresponds to a signal of frequency Fvco (Fig. 7b)<br><br>
which varies within a range having the same width as<br>
the width of the bands B"1 and B"2a, for example<br>
250 MHz. The signal output by the doubler corresponds<br>
to a signal of frequency 2Fvco (Fig. 7b) which varies<br>
within a range having the same width as the band B"2b,<br>
for example 500 MHz.<br>
Depending on the filter selected, the tuning<br>
signal either causes transposition of the band B"1 or<br>
the transposition of the band B"2a or the transposition<br>
of the band B"2b, the resulting band being either B"l<br>
(Fig. 7c) or B"2a (Fig. 7d) or B"2b (Fig. 7e) . The<br>
resulting band B"1, B"2a or B"2b is placed within the<br>
frequency spectrum by the tuning frequency Fvco or by<br>
twice the frequency, 2Fvco, so that a channel selected<br>
from the resulting band lies near an intermediate<br>
frequency FIo (Fig. 7c to 7e) , for example equal to<br>
500 Hz.<br>
Figures 7c, 7d and 7e show by the solid line<br>
the resulting bands B"1, B"2a and B"2b which correspond<br>
to the signal of frequency Fvco represented by the<br>
solid line in Figure 7b. The resulting bands B"1, B"2a<br>
and B"2b corresponding to the signal of frequency Fvco<br>
represented by the dotted lines in Figure 7b are<br>
represented by the dotted lines in Figures 7c, 7d and<br>
7e.<br>
The filter 10 of the band-pass type removes the<br>
unselected channels from the resulting band B"1, B"2a<br>
or B"2b. The filter 10 is a band-pass filter with a<br>
high attenuation, a cut-off frequency of which<br>
corresponds to the intermediate frequency FIo and the<br>
width of which corresponds to the spectral occupancy of<br>
a channel, for example 5 MHz. A mixer 11 coupled to a<br>
local oscillator 12 transposes the selected channel<br>
into a baseband.<br>
Of course, the invention is not limited to the<br>
numerical example mentioned. To determine the various<br>
frequencies used, all that is required is to make use<br>
of the following equations:<br>
FIo=(a+b)/2; y=2a+b; x=(3a+b)/2<br><br>
where a, b and c correspond to the widths of<br>
the sub-band B1, the forbidden band and the sub-band<br>
B2, respectively. The value y corresponds to the<br>
minimum frequency of the oscillator 7., the maximum<br>
frequency being equal to x + a. The frequency Fosc is<br>
obtained by subtracting x from the low frequency of the<br>
sub-band Bl, x representing the low frequency of the<br>
transposed image of the sub-band B1.<br>
An illustrative example of a transmitter<br>
according to the second embodiment of the invention is<br>
shown in Figure 6. This transmitter operates within the<br>
same frequency bands as the receiver of Figure 5. The<br>
transmitter consists overall of the same components as<br>
the receiver, but is distinguished from the receiver by<br>
a reversal in the direction of the signal and the<br>
replacement of the amplifier 2 with a transmission<br>
amplifier 2b.<br>
Many variants on the second embodiment are also<br>
possible, some of which are illustrated in Figure 8. If<br>
the broader sub-band, for example B2, lies at a lower<br>
frequency than the narrower sub-band, for example Bl,<br>
all that is required is to place the frequency of the<br>
oscillator 4 above the sub-band Bl, as shown in Figure<br>
8a, in order to replace the narrower band on the lowest<br>
frequencies.<br>
Figure 8b illustrates a different distribution<br>
between the filters. The broadest part of the image of<br>
the broader sub-band is positioned at a lower frequency<br>
than the narrowest part. The circuits in Figures 5 and<br>
6 remain unchanged but, however, it is necessary to<br>
adapt the cut-off frequencies of the filters 51b, 52b<br>
and 55b and also the various frequencies of the<br>
oscillators. The following equations will therefore be<br>
used, replacing those given above:<br>

The invention provides a simple solution for a broadband transmitter/receiver for<br>
which the working bandwidth is split into atleast two non-contiguous sub-bands.<br>
The invention uses a filtering means 50 which comprises atleast two band-pass<br>
filters 51 and 52 provided with switching means 53 and 54. The use of two<br>
switched filters 51 and 52 makes it possible to use a single synthesizer 6 to scan<br>
two sub-bands of the working bandwidth. The frequency synthesizer 6 operates<br>
for one sub-band in supradyne mode and for the other sub-band in infradyne<br>
mode. In a variant, the invention uses a third filter and divides the bandwidth<br>
into three sub-bands.</td>
