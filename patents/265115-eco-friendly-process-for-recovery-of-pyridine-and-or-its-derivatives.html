				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
In general, this invention relates to the field of recovery of heterocyclic aromatic bases. More particularly the present invention provides an ecofriendly process for recovering pyridine and/or pyridine derivatives from their aqueous mass and/or manufacturing reaction mass employing a liquid-liquid extraction in the presence of an environmentally non-hazardous organic solvent.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Pyridine and pyridine derivatives are effectively used as solvents and also as catalysts. They are used in the synthesis of many different products which are used as medicines, vitamins, food flavorings, paints, dyes, rubber products, adhesives, insecticides and herbicides.<br>
The most general industrial synthetic reaction for the manufacture of pyridine bases is by the catalytic condensation of aldehydes and/or ketones with ammonia. The reaction is usually carried out at 350-500 Â°C and at atmospheric pressure in the presence of alumino-silicate catalyst. Acetaldehyde, formaldehyde (in the form of formaline), and ammonia are fed to a catalyst-containing reactor, where pyridine and alkyl pyridines are formed as the major product. A wide variety of catalysts, reactants, and reaction conditions are reported in known art. "Pyridine and Pyridine Derivatives", Goe, Gerald L., Kirk-Othmer, 3rd Edition, Vol. 19, John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 454 (1978); "Synthetic and Natural sources of the Pyridine Ring", Bailey et al., pp. 1-252 in "Heterocyclic Compounds", Volume 14, "Pyridine and Its Derivatives", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1984); and many other references, all of which are entirely incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Pyridine and pyridine derivatives present in the aqueous mass are extracted by suitable method. A wide variety of methods have been applied to the problem of the separation of pyridine and pyridine derivatives. The pyridine-water azeotrope has been separated in accordance with conventional techniques e.g., by conventionally breaking the water-pyridine azeotrope by the addition of suitable solvent followed by fractional distillation to<br><br>
prepare substantially dry pyridine. The solvent is recovered from pyridines by distillation and recycled back to the recovery column.<br>
Several processes are disclosed in prior patent disclosures for the separation of pyridine or pyridine derivatives from aqueous solutions by using different solvents.<br>
Benzene is most commonly used for the recovery of pyridine and picolines from the aqueous reaction mass. See ref. "Pyridine and Pyridine Derivatives" Shimizu et al p. 399 in "Ullman's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry", Vol. A22, 5th Ed.; Elvers, B., Hawkins, S., Russey, W., Schulz, G., Eds., VCH Publishers, Weinheim (1993).<br>
US Patent 4,883,881, discloses the process in which pyridine was separated from pyridine-water azeotrope by adding benzene thereto and distilling the resultant mixture to recover substantially anhydrous pyridine.<br>
However, benzene loss during the process results in the concern like the cost of environmental protection measures, occupational safety, increased fire risks and additional investments in hazardous waste disposal costs. Besides, the use of benzene has been banned throughout a number of industries because of its hazardous nature. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address these issues, especially when the process is implemented at commercial scale.<br>
US Patent No. 2,058,435 reported a process in which aqueous solutions of pyridine and its homologues are subjected to extraction with highly efficient extracting agents, which are non-solvents with respect to water. The process comprises the recovery of pyridine from its aqueous solution with any one of a number of solvents such as benzene, trichloroethylene, isopropyl ether, pseudo-cumene, cyclohexane, hexane and the like.<br>
European Patent No. EP 1,346,757 discloses liquid-liquid extraction with a solvent consisting of a fluorinated fluid selected from either hydrofluoropolyethers, hydrofluoroethers, hydrofluorocarbons and/or their mixtures with perfluoropolyethers and/or perfluorocarbons.<br>
Other conventional techniques can also be used, e.g., drying operations, extraction, saltation, redistillation, etc., in accordance with fully conventional considerations, e.g., as<br><br>
discussed in any of a wide variety of relevant texts, e.g., see ref. "Chemist's Companion", Gordon, Arnold J. et al., John Wiley and Sons (1972).<br>
Park, Choon Ho. et al in Journal of Applied Polymer Science (1999), 74(1), 83-89, has discussed the pervaporation separation through a poly(acrylonitrile-co-vinylphosphonic acid) membrane. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based copolymers containing phosphonic acid moiety were synthesized for dehydration of aqueous pyridine solution. The in situ complex, formed between the vinylphosphonic acid (VP) moiety in the membrane and the pyridine in the feed, enhanced separation capacity of poly(acrylonitrile-co-vinylphosphonic acid) (PANVP) membranes. All the PAN-based membranes containing phosphonic acid were very selective toward water. The pervaporation performances of PANVP membranes depended on the content of the phosphonic acid moiety in the membrane and operating temperature. The pervaporation separation of water/pyridine mixtures using PANVP membranes exhibited over 99.8% water concentration in permeate and tlux of 4-120 gm^h"1 depending on the content of vinylphosphonic acid and operating temperature.<br>
US Patent No. 6,087,507 describes a method of continuously separating pyridine or pyridine derivatives from aqueous solutions by extraction, wherein supercritical fluid is employed to extract the pyridine material from liquid media. The method of the invention, in particular, extracts pyridine or pyridine derivatives from aqueous solutions with pressurized carbon dioxide, which is used under pressure, or in the liquid state, or in the near critical state or in the supercritical state. The operating system is a continuously operating extraction system, so that a part, or all, of the pyridine and/or pyridine derivatives are transferred from the aqueous phase to the carbon dioxide phase, and thereafter the aqueous phase and carbon dioxide phase are separated from each other; and the pyridine and/or pyridine derivatives are separated from carbon dioxide; and the extract containing pyridine and/or pyridine derivatives is thereby obtained. Preferred temperatures for the pyridine and/or pyridine derivative contacting with carbon dioxide are from 5 to 80 Â°C; and preferred pressures range from 60 to 300 bar. However, the process is not suitable at industrial scale because extraction was done at very high pressure (60 to 300 bar). This makes extraction process operationally unfriendly and highly capital intensive at industrial scale.<br><br>
The processes disclosed in the prior art used hazardous and industrially unsuitable solvents. Some of the solvents disclosed are highly unsafe to handle in commercial scale manufacturing processes. The problems associated with the above prior art can be overcome by using commercially viable and eco-friendly process and solvent to avoid all the above-mentioned problems in the known prior art.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
While this specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming that, which is regarded as the invention, it is anticipated that the invention can be more readily understood through reading the following detailed description of the invention and study of the included examples.<br>
Now a days with increasing ecological problems viz., pollution, global warming etc., the emphasis in industries is not only on economical process but also on green processes. Thus, in present scenario it has become a need to combine economic and ecological principle in any process development. Accordingly, these objects are accomplished by the<br><br>
present invention, which in its broadest aspects provides an extraction process for pyridine and derivatives without using highly hazardous solvents like benzene and highly capital intensive and operationally unfriendly process like using carbon dioxide.<br>
The disclosed embodiment of the present invention deals with a process for the recovery of pyridine and/or its derivatives that have advantage as it avoids handling of unsafe solvent like benzene and also effectively recycle the solvent used in the recovery. Moreover, the present process involves utilization of industrially suitable solvent to make it comparatively safe, more operational friendly and economical. Thus, the present invention addresses the disadvantages and complications associated with the processes heretofore disclosed.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process of recovering pyridine and pyridine derivatives from aqueous reaction mass using alkyl acetate (Class III solvent as per ICH guidelines) as a substitute to hazardous solvent like benzene (Class I solvent as per ICH guidelines). Alkyl acetate as solvents are non-toxic and environmentally acceptable as compared to benzene. The use of alkyl acetate for the recovery of pyridine and pyridine derivatives reduces the environmental hazards, cost involved in the environmental protection measures, increase occupational safety and bring savings in hazardous waste disposal cost, apart from direct investment gains.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the recovery of pyridine and/or pyridine derivatives from aqueous reaction mass with an eco-friendly solvent, which is an excellent solvent for pyridine and its derivatives but is substantially a non-solvent with respect to water. After the extraction is completed, the resulting extract is subjected to fractional distillation, which completely removes the solvent and leaves the pyridine in substantially anhydrous condition.<br>
According to the present invention, the process used herein capable of isolating pyridine and/or its derivatives in substantially anhydrous condition from ^manufacturing reaction mass. The "manufacturing reaction mass" used herein is meant to refer the reaction mass is obtained during manufacturing of pyridine and/or its derivatives, wherein said manufacturing mass may comprises pyridine, beta picoline, ammonia, aliphatic amines,<br><br>
aldehyde and aldehyde based organic impurities, other monoalkyl pyridines, dialkyl pyridines, trialkyl pyridines or other unidentified heavy organic materials.<br>
The disclosed preferred embodiment of the present invention describing a process for the separation of pyridine and/or pyridine derivatives from aqueous mass and/or its manufacturing reaction mass can be more readily understood through reading the following detailed description of the invention and the process Flow diagram.<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of pyridine and pyridine derivatives comprising first recovering ammonia from the reaction mass under atmospheric pressure maintaining pot temperature 85 - 95 Â°C to achieve minimum possible ammonia in the reaction mass (desirable 
The reaction mass obtained after ammonia recovery is extracted with an organic solvent preferably alkyl acetate. The alkyl acetate used herein is preferably selected from ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methyl acetate etc. Preferred is ethyl acetate. The recovery is done in batch extraction system. However, the recovery can also be performed in continuous extraction system. The aqueous reaction mass containing pyridine and picolines in addition to other high boiling pyridine bases and some low boiling constituents is agitated with the solvent by any known prior art process. After agitating for about 30 minutes at room temperature, agitation is stopped to separate out the two layers. The aqueous layer is analyzed for pyridine and picoline content. This process is repeated again for the aqueous layer with alkyl acetate till pyridine and/or pyridine derivatives content in aqueous layer [STREAM - 1 ] is achieved 
Further the obtained aqueous layer is heated under atmospheric pressure employing fractionating column. The precut consists of two layers, which is separated and the leftover free from pyridine bases can be easily disposed of, either by incineration or by suitably using in other processes. The organic layer of precut, enriched with alkyl acetate/alkanol is recycled for extraction after esterification of remaining alkanol into<br><br>
alkyl acetate as per process already established commercially. The aqueous layer of the precut is suitably incinerated.<br>
The process described above in accordance with invention, the organic layer is distilled employing fractionating column. The dean stark assembly is also attached for the recovery of water layer. Small amount of water is present in the organic layer because of solubility of water in alkyl acetate. The precut consists of organic and aqueous layer. The water layer [STREAM -2] is mixed with aqueous layer [STREAM - 1] obtained after final extraction, for the recovery of alkyl acetate/alkanol by distillation technique as discussed above. After isolation of precut, cut-1 [STREAM - 4], which contains alkyl acetate with some alkanol is recovered. The quantity of intercut is maintained such that alkanol in recovered alkyl acetate used for next batch extraction is preferably maintained 0.2%, this cut is mixed with STREAM - 3 and added at water washing stage in the esterification process, for the recovery of alkyl acetate which is recycled at extraction stage.<br>
Distillation is continued after the recovery of precut and cut - 1 to recover solvent, which can be used for next batch extraction. The leftover mass after solvent recovery is further distilled employing fractionating column in steps as per established procedure industrially followed to recover pyridine and picolines of desired specifications.<br>
