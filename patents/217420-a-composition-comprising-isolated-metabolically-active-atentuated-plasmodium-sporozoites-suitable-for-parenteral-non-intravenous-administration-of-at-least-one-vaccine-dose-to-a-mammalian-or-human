METHOD FOR THE PREVENTION OF MALARIA<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001]   This application is based on and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
S.N. 60/427,91 l, filed November 20, 2002. The entire disclosure of this provisional application<br>
is relied upon and incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002]   This application relates to preventing malaria by administering a vaccine. More<br>
particularly, this invention relates to a vaccine against malaria infection comprising the<br>
administration of attenuated sporozoites to a human or animal.<br>
INTRODUCTION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
[003]   Malaria is a disease that affects 300-500 million people, kills one to three million<br>
individuals annually, and has an enormous economic impact on people in the developing world,<br>
especially those in sub Saharan Africa [1, 2]. Plasmodium falciparum accounts for the majority<br>
of deaths from malaria in the world. The World Tourist Organization reported that of the nearly<br>
700 million international tourist arrivals recorded worldwide in 2000, approximately 9 million<br>
were to West, Central or East Africa, 37 million were to South-East Asia, 6 million to South Asia<br>
and 10 million to Oceania [3]. It is estimated that more than 10,000 travelers from North<br>
America, Europe, and Japan contract malaria per year. For more than 100 years during every<br>
military campaign conducted where malaria was transmitted, the U.S. forces have had more<br>
casualties from malaria than from hostile fire. An estimated 12,000,000 person days were lost <br>
during World War II and 1.2 million during the Vietnam conflict due to malaria [4].<br>
[004]   Transmission of the parasite Plasmodium (the protozoan parasite causing malaria)<br>
occurs via the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, which are active from dusk to<br>
dawn. Sporozoites migrate from the bite site to the liver via the blood stream, where they<br>
multiply within hepatocytes, producing, in the case of P. falciparum, 10,000-40,000 progeny per<br>
infected cell. These liver stage parasites express a set of antigens which are not expressed in<br>
sporozoites. This new generation of parasites re-enters the blood stream as merozoites,<br>
expressing a set of antigens which are different from those expressed during the sporozoite and<br>
early hepatic stages, and invade erythrocytes, where additional multiplication increases parasite<br>

WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
numbers by approximately 10 to 20 fold every 48 hours. Unlike the five to ten day development<br>
in the liver, which does not induce any symptoms or signs of illness, untreated blood stage<br>
infection causes hemolysis, shaking chills, high fevers, and prostration. In the case of P.<br>
falciparum, the most dangerous of the four species of Plasmodium that infect humans, the<br>
disease is complicated by disruption of microcirculatory blood flow and metabolic changes in<br>
vital organs such as the brain, kidney and lung, frequently leading to death if not urgently<br>
treated.<br>
[005]   An effective vaccine against P. falciparum malaria remains one of the great<br>
challenges of medicine. Despite over one hundred years of effort, hundreds of millions of<br>
dollars in research, lifelong sacrifice from dedicated physicians and scientist and many<br>
promising experimental vaccines, there is no marketed vaccine to alleviate one of the great<br>
infectious scourges of humanity. A generation ago, public health initiatives employing<br>
chloroquine, DDT and vector control programs seemed poised to consign falciparum malaria to<br>
insignificance as a worldwide menace. The lack of an effective vaccine complicated these<br>
efforts, but sustainable control seemed imminent.<br>
[006]   The promise of impending success was short lived and the reasons for failure were<br>
multi-factorial. The parasites grew increasingly resistant to highly effective and affordable anti-<br>
malarial medications, vector control measures lapsed, and trans-migration, war and economic<br>
disruption became increasingly more common in endemic areas of the developing world. As a<br>
result, falciparum malaria has resurged, annually placing 2.5 billion humans at risk, causing 300-<br>
900 million infections, and killing 1-3 million people. Of the many social, economic,<br>
environmental and political problems that afflict the developing world, P. falciparum malaria is<br>
increasingly seen as both a root cause and cruel result of these inequities, and is a singular<br>
impediment to solving these complex problems. Controlling falciparum malaria in the<br>
developing world may be possible without an effective vaccine. In practice, given social,<br>
political and economic realities,  the inventors believe that a vaccine may be an essential<br>
component of a sustainable control program, and will be required for a global eradication<br>
campaign.<br>
[007]   It is in this context that the modern period of malaria vaccine development has been<br>
particularly frustrating. Since the early 1980's, breathtaking technological advances in<br>
molecular biology and medical science have occurred. These advances accelerated the<br>
identification of stage-specific P. falciparum proteins and epitopes, and host immune<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
mechanisms and responses. This knowledge was translated into a range of novel vaccine<br>
candidates [5,6]. In one sense, this modem period has been the golden age of malaria vaccine<br>
research and human testing. However, in spite of the Herculean efforts of malaria researchers,<br>
the majority of these vaccines have failed to provide any protective immunity in humans — with<br>
only one demonstrating reproducible short term protection against infection in 40%-70% of<br>
recipients [7-9].<br>
[008]   Given enough time and resources, these vaccine strategies, or others yet to be<br>
developed, may ultimately lead to a robust vaccine. However, at a recent Keystone meeting,<br>
"Malaria's Challenge: From Infants to Genomics to Vaccines" [6], the attendees were polled as<br>
to when they thought a malaria vaccine might be "launched" as a commercial product. Many in<br>
the room indicated that they thought the first vaccine would not be launched until 2016-2025.<br>
The leader of Glaxo Smith Kline's (GSK) efforts to develop a recombinant P. falciparum<br>
circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) vaccine voiced the most optimism. It was indicated that if all<br>
went well, this single protein vaccine could be "launched" in 7-8 years (2009-2010). Given that<br>
GSK and the U.S. Army have been working on a recombinant protein PfCSP vaccine since the<br>
1984 cloning of the PfCSP [10], and that many malariologists express concern as to whether a<br>
single protein vaccine will be adequate to sustainably control malaria, this time line of more than<br>
25 years for development of a single protein vaccine places a chillingly realistic perspective on<br>
the possibilities for developing vaccines that will truly reduce the burden of this disease.<br>
[009]   Protective Immunity After Immunization with Radiation Attenuated<br>
Sporozoites: In, 1967 Nussenzweig repotted that intravenous administration of radiation,<br>
attenuated P. berghei sporozoites to A/J mice protected the mice against challenge with<br>
infectious P. berghei sporozoites [11]. These rodent studies provided the impetus for human<br>
studies, and by the early 1970s, two groups established that immunizing human volunteers with<br>
the bites of irradiated mosquitoes carrying P. falciparum sporozoites in their salivary glands<br>
could protect volunteers against challenge with fully infectious P. falciparum sporozoites [12-<br>
19]. These studies demonstrated that a malaria vaccine offering sterile protective immunity was<br>
possible. However, the only way to produce sporozoites at that time was to infect a volunteer<br>
with P. falciparum, treat the volunteer with doses of chloroquine to suppress but not eliminate<br>
the parasite, allow gametocytes to develop, and then feed mosquitoes on these volunteers. Even<br>
if one could produce sporozoites in adequate numbers by this method, it was considered<br>
clinically, technically and logistically impractical to immunize humans with an irradiated<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
sporozoite vaccine. In large part this was because the sporozoites had to be delivered alive,<br>
either by the bite of infected mosquitoes, or by intravenous injection as was done with mice. The<br>
scientists active in the field concluded that other routes of immunization would not provide<br>
adequate or comparable protection as compared to immunization by intravenous injection or by<br>
the bite of infected mosquitoes; in essence ruling out the use of attenuated sporozoites as a<br>
vaccine from their perspective. The published views of several such scientists are quoted below.<br>
[010]   "This observation corroborates previous reports (Nussenzweig, Vanderberg and<br>
Most, 1967 and 1969) and extends their findings. Groups of mice immunized by other parenteral<br>
routes (i.m., i.p., and i.e) exhibited an overall level of protection much lower than the i.v.<br>
immunized mice." [20]<br>
[011]   "These studies have confirmed a previous report which demonstrated that<br>
intramuscularly injected irradiated sporozoites of P. berghei are far less effective than these<br>
injected intravenously in protectively immunizing mice against sporozoite-induced malaria...The<br>
chief limitation preventing an extension to human trials was the requirement for intravenous<br>
immunization a procedure posing unacceptable medical risks," (In the study referred to in this<br>
quotation, protection by the intramuscular route ranged between. 11% and 42% and protection<br>
by the subcutaneous route was 0%) [21].<br>
[012]   "It was further shown that of the various routes of immunization used in vaccination<br>
attempts in rodents (i.m., i.v., subcutaneous, per os, etc.) the intravenous route gave the highest<br>
degree of protection and most reproducible results. The only other very effective route of<br>
immunization is by the bite of infected, irradiated mosquitoes." [22]. In this 1980 review, "Use<br>
of Radiation-attenuated sporozoites in the Immunoprophylaxis of Malaria," Dr- Nussenzweig<br>
goes on to discuss the potential for developing a sporozoite malaria vaccine, and concludes, "In<br>
conclusion, recent findings appear to indicate that we now have the necessary powerful tools<br>
which should provide the means to clarify the mechanism of sporozoite-induced immunity and to<br>
isolate the protective antigens. Under these conditions, the various obstacles to the development<br>
of a sporozoite vaccine for malaria appear to be surmountable, hopefully in the not too remote<br>
future." Dr. Nussenzweig does not discuss the idea of utilizing a whole attenuated sporozoite<br>
vaccine as a reasonable alternative, only the use of sporozoites to provide the components of a<br>
vaccine that induces immunity against the sporozoite stage.<br>
[013]   In 1980 after nearly 15 years of  work on the irradiated sporozoite vaccine model, it<br>
was concluded by the unquestioned leader in the field, Dr. Nussenzweig, that the route to a<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
vaccine lay through modem science; understanding immunologic mechanisms of protection and<br>
the antigenic targets of those protective immune responses, and constructing a "subunit"<br>
sporozoite vaccine. From then onwards there was essentially no mention or discussion in the<br>
literature of trying to develop an attenuated whole parasite sporozoite vaccine as a practical<br>
vaccine for humans for many reasons, not the least of which was that despite these 15 years of<br>
research, no scientists had discovered a reasonable approach to administering sporozoites other<br>
than by intravenous administration or by the bite of infected mosquitoes.<br>
[014]    There was also no further work to develop an attenuated sporozoite vaccine,<br>
because the sporozoites would have to be raised in aseptic mosquitoes, aseptically purified, and<br>
suitably preserved and reconstituted prior to administration, and after such treatment would still<br>
have to be able to elicit protective immune responses when administered.<br>
[015 ]   Potential solutions to parts of the problems of production, though not recognized at<br>
the time as being related to developing an attenuated sporozoite vaccine, were being reported. In<br>
1975, a method for culturing P.falciparum in vitro was reported [23, 24], followed in 1982 by a<br>
method for producing gametocytes from these cultures [24]. In 1986, it was reported that humans<br>
could be infected by the sporozoites produced in mosquitoes that had fed on these in vitro<br>
cultures [26]. There was therefore a way to produce sporozoites without the difficulties of in vivo<br>
production of gametocytes in humans. These developments on their own were not adequate to<br>
overcome all of the obstacles to development of attenuated sporozoite vaccine. There was not a<br>
way to produce enough of the sporozoites or produce and process the sporozoites under<br>
conditions that met regulatory standards. Furthermore, there were no data indicating that<br>
properly produced and processed sporozoites could be administered successfully in a clinically<br>
acceptable and practical manner.<br>
[016]   Thus, following the failure of the malaria scientific community to discover a<br>
method to deliver attenuated sporozoites in a clinically acceptable and practical manner<br>
sufficient to achieve high level protection, the attenuated sporozoite vaccine was dropped from<br>
clinical consideration and the community as presaged by Dr. Nussenzweig'(paragraph [012]<br>
above) embraced modem molecular science in the hope of developing a vaccine. Several<br>
promising developments launched the modern era of malaria sub-unit vaccine development. A<br>
monoclonal antibody against the major surface protein of sporozoites, the circumsporozoite<br>
protein (CSP),  had been produced and shown to protect mice in passive transfer experiments<br>
[27]. Additionally, the gene encoding the PfCSP protein had been cloned and sequenced [10].<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
Coincidentally, the first purified recombinant protein vaccine, the hepatitis B surface antigen<br>
vaccine, was developed and marketed [28]. The weight of evidence and trends in vaccine<br>
science seemed to offer malaria researchers a roadmap to quickly develop a human malaria<br>
vaccine. Since it was considered impractical to produce and administer the sporozoite vaccine,<br>
returning to an attenuated whole parasite vaccine seemed unnecessary and dated, and all<br>
subsequent efforts focused on the promise of sub-unit vaccines.<br>
[017]   In 1987 when the first recombinant protein [29] and synthetic peptide [30] vaccines<br>
did not prove to be as protective as expected, instead of considering the development of an<br>
attenuated sporozoite vaccine which was considered impossible to produce and administer,<br>
scientists focused on understanding the immune mechanisms responsible for protective<br>
immunity, and the antigenic targets of these protective immune responses, and developing<br>
subunit vaccines and vaccine delivery systems that induced such protection. Much of this basic<br>
work was carried out in the P. berghei and P. yoetii rodent model systems. This rodent malaria<br>
work provided important insights into immunologic mechanisms and antigenic targets of<br>
irradiated sporozoite vaccine-induced protection and led to the development of a number of<br>
candidate vaccines [31-33]. None of these studies which were conducted after the cloning of the<br>
gene encoding the P. falciparum circumsporzoite protein (PfCSP) in 1984 through the end of the<br>
millenium suggested the possibility of developing a human irradiated whole sporozoite vaccine,<br>
because none of the investigators thought it was possible to produce or administer such a vaccine<br>
in a practical manner. Interestingly, sub-unit (recombinant protein, synthetic peptide,<br>
recombinant virus. DNA plasmid) vaccine formulations have been shown to produce excellent<br>
protection in mice, but nothing comparable in humans. In contrast the protection in mice by<br>
intravenous administration of irradiated sporozoites [11] led to human studies, that demonstrated<br>
that exposure to the bites of irradiated mosquitoes with P. falciparum sporozoites in their<br>
salivary glands induced protection [34].<br>
[018]   In 1989, after a number of disappointing clinical trials of sub-unit PfCSP vaccines,<br>
immunization of volunteers by the bites of mosquitoes carrying P. falciparum sporozoites in<br>
their salivary glands and then attenuated by exposure in vivo to gamma radiation was begun at<br>
the Naval Medical Research Institute later Naval Medical Research Center (NMRI later NMRC)<br>
and Walter Reed Army institute of Research (WRAIR). The goal of this research was to better<br>
delineate the clinical characteristics and requirements that led to protecting humans with the,<br>
irradiated sporozoite vaccine, assess the protective immune responses elicited in humans, and<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
identify the antigens and epitopes on those proteins that elicited immune responses in humans. It<br>
was never a consideration to develop irradiated sporozoites as a human vaccine, as it was<br>
considered completely impractical and technically unfeasible to produce such, a vaccine as well<br>
as to administer such, a vaccine. Preliminary clinical results and extensive immunological assay<br>
results from these studies were published [35-41]. These immunological studies combined with<br>
those of others on this subject [42-48] increased our understanding of the immunological<br>
responses in humans immunized with radiation attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites. However,<br>
there waS no consideration or mention of trying to develop an attenuated sporozoite vaccine.<br>
[019]   The results of the first 10 years' clinical experience with these immunizations and<br>
challenges were recently reported, and combined with all the published clinical reports of<br>
immunizing humans with irradiated Plasmodium sporozoites [34] from the University of<br>
Maryland (1970's, late 1980's and early 1990's), and the Rush - Presbyterian - StLuke's Medical<br>
Centre in Chicago and the Naval Medical Research Institute in the 1970's [12-19, 34]. A number<br>
of observations arose from the analysis that was conducted.<br>
[020]   A). There was a dose response in regard to protective immunity among volunteers<br>
challenged by the bite of 5-14 infected mosquitoes. Thirteen of 14 volunteers (93%) immunized<br>
by the bites of greater than 1000 infected, irradiated mosquitoes were protected against<br>
developing blood stage P. falciparum infection when challenged within 10 weeks of their last<br>
primary immunization. There were 35 challenges of these volunteers and there was complete<br>
protection against development of blood stage infection in 33 of the 35 challenges (94%). Four<br>
of 10 volunteers (40%) immunized by the bite of greater than 200 and less than 1000 infected,<br>
irradiated mosquitoes were protected against developing blood stage P. falciparum infection<br>
when challenged within 10 weeks of their last primary immunization, a significantly lower level<br>
of protective immunity than among volunteers immunized with&gt; 1000 infective bites (p=<br>
0.0088, Fisher's exact test, 2-tailed). There were 15 challenges of the volunteers immunized<br>
with less than 1000 infective bites, and there was complete protection against development of<br>
blood stage infection in 5 of the 15 challenges (33%), a significantly lower level of protective<br>
immunity than among volunteers immunized with &gt; 1000 infective bites (p= 0.000015, Fisher's<br>
exact test, 2-tailed).<br>
[021]   B).    Protective immunity lasted for at least 42 weeks (10.5 months). Five of 6 of<br>
the above 14 volunteers when challenged from 23 to 42 weeks (23, 36, 39, 41, and 42 weeks)<br>
after their last primary or secondary immunization were protected against experimental<br>

challenge. Except for a single challenge of one volunteer five years after last immunization (not<br>
protected), there were no other challenges assessing longevity of protective immunity.<br>
[022]   C).   Protection was not strain specific. Four volunteers were challenged with<br>
isolates of P. falciporum different than, the isolates with which they were immunized. The four<br>
volunteers were completely protected in seven of seven such challenges with different isolates of<br>
P. falciparum.<br>
[023]   D).   Immunologic memory lasts for at least 5 years. A volunteer who had been<br>
exposed to the bite of 1601 irradiated infected mosquitoes, and protected when challenged 9 and<br>
42 weeks after last exposure, was not protected when re-challenged 5 years after last exposure to<br>
to irradiated, infected mosquitoes. He was treated for his malaria, boosted by exposure to 147<br>
irradiated, infected mosquitoes, and re-challenged by exposure to the bite of 5 non-irradiated<br>
mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum sporozoites. This volunteer was protected against that<br>
infectious challenge [34], demonstrating that the protective immunity was boostable with a<br>
single exposure to irradiated sporozoites.<br>
[024]   Thus, protection was achieved in greater than 90% of challenge experiments after<br>
greater than 1000 mosquito bites, lasted for at least 10.5 months, and was not P.falciparum<br>
isolate (strain) specific.<br>
A "sub-unit" vaccine demonstrating this level of protective efficacy in human subjects<br>
would be recognized as a major breakthrough. Though it was routinely observed that protection<br>
resulted from this experimental irradiated sporozoite vaccine, the sheer power of attenuated<br>
sporozoites remained unrecognized until after completion of the careful analysis necessary to<br>
publish this report. Interestingly, when these results were presented by one of us (SLH) at the<br>
Keystone meeting in March 2002, "Malaria's Challenge: From Infants to Genomics to<br>
Vaccines," they were considered interesting, but no one in the audience even raised the idea that<br>
this approach should be pursued as viable malaria vaccine, because all thought the vaccine to be<br>
impractical to produce and impossible to administer. This view is still widely held in the<br>
scientific community. In a recent publication in Nature magazine (October 2, 2003) [49], the<br>
director of clinical trials at the Naval Medical Research Center Malaria Program stated, "The<br>
barriers have seemed sufficiently daunting that no one has been willing to give it a try," and a<br>
malaria vaccine expert from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, stated, "It's a long<br>
shot ....It's worth a try, although the odds are heavily stacked against him." In contrast, the<br>
inventors believed that it was possible to make such a vaccine, but there were several critical<br>

questions that had to be answered before moving into cGMP manufacturing and clinical trials.<br>
These are outlined in a recent publication [50] One of the most critical questions was whether<br>
one can administer attenuated sporozoites by a route that is practical for a human vaccine?<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[025]   Heretofore, it had been considered impractical to immunize humans with attenuated<br>
Plasmodium species sporozoites, because the sporozoites had to be delivered by the bite of<br>
infected irradiated mosquitoes for immunization, or by intravenous injection, as this was what<br>
had been done previously with humans and mice respectively, and was accepted by the scientific<br>
community as the only way to achieve high level protective immunity.<br>
[026]   It has been theorized that when properly irradiated sporozoites are delivered by<br>
mosquito bite or intravenous injection, they pass through the bloodstream to the liver, invade<br>
hepatocytes, partially develop, and then arrest development, never developing to the mature liver<br>
sehizont, which ruptures, and releases merozoites which cause infection of erythrocytes, and the<br>
disease known as malaria. Thus, they are attenuated. Data indicate that in order to elicit adequate<br>
protective immune responses, the parasites must invade hepatocytes, partially develop, and<br>
express new proteins that are the targets of protective immune responses, particularly CD8 T<br>
cells.<br>
[027]   The inventors theorized that there is a direct correlation/assocation between the<br>
infectivity of a preparation of unirradiated sporozoites and their capacity to elicit protective<br>
immunity when they are attenuated. Furthermore, we theorized that there is a direct<br>
correlation/assocation between the infectivity of unirradiated sporozoites when administered by a<br>
particular method, and the capacity of those sporozoites when irradiated and delivered by that<br>
method to elicit protective immunity.<br>
[028]   The present invention described herein was discovered in response to asking the<br>
question, can one administer the attenuated sporozoites by a route that is practical for a human<br>
vaccine?<br>
[029]   This question was addressed using the P. yoelii rodent malaria parasite, not the P.<br>
berghei rodent malaria parasite, which had been studied previously in all reports cited above (11,<br>
20-22). The P. berghei model system was used to establish that irradiated sporozoites protect A/J<br>
mice, and this led to the human studies demonstrating that exposure to irradiated P.falcipatrum<br>
infected mosquitoes protects humans. The P. berghei system was also used to prove to the<br>
scientific community that intramuscular, subcutaneous and other non-intravenous routes of<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
administration of irradiated sporozoites are not adequately protective in mice (20-22). In fact<br>
after subcutaneous administration of radiation attenuated sporozoites protection was 0% [21].<br>
These studies which were primarily done in A/J mice led to the conclusion that it was not<br>
possible to develop irradiated sporozoites as a practical, clinically relevant malaria vaccine for<br>
humans. In the early to mid 1980s the Naval Medical Research Institute laboratory switched<br>
from working with P. berghei in A/J mice to working with P. yoelii in BALB/c mice. This was<br>
because the scientists at the Naval Medical Research Institute believed that intravenously<br>
administered P. yoelii in BALB/c mice was more predictive of P. falciparum infection in humans<br>
than was intravenously administered P. berghei. This was in large part because intravenously<br>
administered P. yoelii sporozoites are so much more infectious to mice than are intravenously<br>
administered P. berghei sporozoites. The 50% infectious dose to mice of intravenously<br>
administered P. yoelii in BALB/c mice is approximately 100-1000 times lower than the 50%<br>
infectious dose of P. berghei in BALB/c mice and almost certainly more comparable to the 50%<br>
infectious dose of Plasmodium sp. parasites in primates, such as P. knowlesi in monkeys and P.<br>
falciparum in humans than is P. berghei. In the early 1990s, approximately 10 years after the<br>
Navy group began working with P. yoelii instead of P. berghei, after reading papers and hearing<br>
presentations from scientists from the Navy group, Dr. Nussenzweig requested the P. yoelii<br>
parasites used by the Navy laboratory from one of the inventors (SLH), and essentially switched<br>
the work in her group at New York University on rodent malaria to the P. yoelii model system,<br>
primarily working with BALB/c mice.<br>
[030]   It is important to note that all work with P. yoelii has focused on administration by<br>
intravenous injection or mosquito bite, almost certainly because of the previous work in the P.<br>
berghei model system described above [11, 20-22]. Furthermore, because of that work in the P.<br>
berghei model system no one has experimented in the P. yoelii system to try to use it as a model<br>
to develop an attenuated whole sporozoite vaccine. Immunization with irradiated sporozoites in<br>
the P. yoelii rodent malaria system has been used by scientists for the same scientific objectives<br>
described in 1980 by Nussenzweig [22]; to identify the immune mechanisms of protective<br>
immunity and the antigenic targets on the parasite of these protective immune responses. For this<br>
reason, since it has been "known" for more than 25 years that only intravenous or mosquito bite<br>
administration of sporozoites provides the 100% protective immunity that makes the irradiated<br>
sporozoite model so effective, these have been the routes of administration used by scientists<br>
working in this system. The other routes (e.g. subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and<br>

WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
others) that would be required to make the irradiated sporozoite clinically practical and<br>
acceptable have not been used.<br>
[031]   The inventors have discovered a method for immunizing subjects against malaria<br>
which allows for the vaccination of  large numbers of subjects with attenuated sporozoites in a<br>
relatively short time, avoids the impracticality and potential danger of the previous methods of<br>
bite by infected mosquitoes, or in the case of mice by intravenous injection, and which provides<br>
protection comparable to that achieved by these prior methods.<br>
[032]   More particularly, we have discovered that effective protection against malaria can<br>
be obtained by parentally administering a dosage of attenuated sporazoites to a subject by a route<br>
other than intravenous injection, including, but not limited to the subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
inteadermal, mucosal, submucosal, epidermal, and cutaneous routes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[033]   The instant invention provides a new clinically relevant and acceptable method of<br>
administering attenuated Plasmodium species sporozoites that makes it practical for attenuated<br>
sporozoites to be used as a vaccine to prevent malaria in humans, mammals, avians, and other<br>
relevant species.<br>
[034]   The invention's significant improvement over previously standard methods of<br>
administration, administration by intravenous injection or by the bite of infected mosquitoes, of<br>
attenuated sporozoites is that it allows for a clinically practical and safe method of administering<br>
the vaccine that provides protection comparable to the previous standard methods.<br>
Administration by the bite of infected mosquitoes can never be used as a vaccine for obvious<br>
reasons, and administration by intravenous injection is a, method that is not in general use for any<br>
vaccine, because it is a technically difficult method of administration, especially in young<br>
children, and it is potentially dangerous because of direct injection into the bloodstream.<br>
[035]   With the present invention, the parenteral administration may be administered in the<br>
skin (transcutaneous. epidermally, intradermally), subcutaneous tissue (subcutaneously), muscle<br>
(intramuscularly), through the mucous membranes, or in the submucosal tissue-Preferably, the<br>
administration is subcutaneously, intrdermally or intramuscularly.<br>
[036]   The goal of attenuation is to weaken the parasites, so that they are viable enough to<br>
invade host cells and produce new proteins, but unable to produce a replicating asexual blood<br>
stage infection that causes disease. Attenuation can occur in multiple ways. For example this<br>
can occur by attenuating the parasites so that inoculated sporozoites can invade host cells,<br><br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
partially develop in these cells, and arrest development before reaching the stage compatible to a<br>
mature hepatic stage parasite that can rupture releasing merozoites that invade erythrocytes and<br>
cause disease. This type of attenuated parasite can be termed a metabolically active, non-<br>
replicating parasite. Attenuation could also occur by producing parasites that can invade and<br>
normally develop in host cells to the stage comparable to a mature hepatic stage parasite, rupture<br>
from the host cells, but be unable to develop in erythrocytes to the point required for them to     <br>
cause disease. This could also occur by attenuating the parasites so that they can invade and<br>
normally develop in host cells to the stage comparable to a mature hepatic stage parasite, rupture<br>
from the host cells, but be unable to develop in erythrocytes to the point required for them to<br>
cause significant disease. This could also occur by attenuating the parasites so that sporozoites<br>
partially develop and produce new proteins, but arrest development before reaching the stage<br>
comparable to a mature hepatic stage parasite that can rupture releasing merozoites that invade<br>
erythrocytes and cause disease.                                                                           <br>
[037]   While numerous methods of attenuation may be used, we have found that<br>
attenuation by irradiation is currently preferred for producing a metabolically active, non-<br>
replicating parasite. Attenuation of the sporozoites can be accomplished in multiple ways with<br>
multiple dosage regimens. The attenuation can be accomplished while the sporozoites are still in<br>
the mosquito, after they have been isolated from the mosquitoes and before interventions such as<br>
cryopreservation, or after they have been isolated from the mosquitoes and after interventions<br>
such as cryopreservation. The current dose of irradiation based on previous experience is<br>
generally greater than 12,000 Rads (cGy) and less than 23,000 Rads (cGy) for Plasmodium<br>
falciparum sporozoites with 15,000 Rads (cGy) being most commonly used [34]. One skilled in<br>
 the art will recognize that this dosage may vary from species to species or strain to strain or with<br>
the apparatus and techniques used to irradiate the sporozoites. One skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that the irradiation can be accomplished using numerous methods, including, but not<br>
limited to gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, or other subatomic particles such as electrons,<br>
protons, or combinations of these methods.                                             <br>
[038]   In the future, attenuation as described in paragraph [39] above may be achieved by<br>
genetic manipulation of the parasites prior to their being introduced into the vaccine recipient.<br>
[039]   Attenuation may also be achieved by treating individuals before or after exposure to<br>
sporozoites with drugs which prevent development of the parasites so that they can replicate in<br>
hepatoctyes.<br>

WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
[040]   Attenuation may also be achieved by treating individuals before or after exposure to<br>
sporozoites with drugs which prevent development of the parasites so that they can replicate in<br>
erythrocytes.<br>
[041]   Attenuation may also be achieved by treating the sporozoites with chemicals which<br>
attenuate the parasites.<br>
[042]   The means of administration may be any methods for inoculation other than by<br>
mosquito bite or intravemous administration, such as, but not limited to injection with a single<br>
needle and syringe, multiple needles and syringe arrays, micro-needles with one to hundreds to<br>
thousands of pores, needleless injection by ballistic techniques, and the like. The attenuated<br>
sporozoites may also be delivered by a transcutaneous patch, or on a particulate material, for<br>
example, gold beads. While it is possible to achieve a level of protection with a single<br>
inoculation, it is preferred that a series of two or more inoculations or exposures be effected.<br>
[043]   The preferred inoculant is a malaria mimunization effective amount of attenuated P.<br>
falciparum or other Plasmodium species sporozoites. The dosage in humans per inoculation may<br>
range from about 1,000 to 10, 000,000, although this may be varied depending on evaluation by<br>
the practitioner or the immunogenicity /potency of the attenuated sporozoite preparations.<br>
[044]   Any Plasmodium species parasite, even if altered genetically, may be used in the<br>
method of the invention. In one embodiment, the parasite is P. falciparum. In other<br>
embodiments, for example, the parasite may be P vivax, P. ovale, or P. malariae. In other<br>
embodiments it could a mixture of these parasites. In other embodiments it could be<br>
Plasmodiium knowlesi, P. yoelii, or other Plasmodium species parasites.<br>
[045]   In one embodiment the invention provides a pharmaceutical kit comprising the<br>
attenuated sporozoites in the delivery instrument such as a syringe.<br>
[046]   In other embodiments the invention provides a kit which includes a container such<br>
as a vial, but not limited to a vial containing the frozen attenuated sporozoites, a container such<br>
as a vial containing fluid to dilute the attenuated sporozoites, and the actual delivery devices,<br>
such as a syringe and needle.                                                                  <br>
[047]   In other embodiments the invention provides a kit which includes a container such<br>
as a vial, but not limited to a vial containing the freeze-dried (lyophilizied) attenuated<br>
sporozoites, a container such as a vial containing fluid to dilute the attenuated sporozoites, and<br>
the actual delivery devices, such as a syringe and needle.<br>

[048]   In other embodiments the invention provides a kit which includes a container such<br>
as a vial, but not limited to a vial containing preserved attenuated sporozoites, a container such as<br>
a vial containing fluid to dilute the attenuated sporozoites, and the actual delivery devices, such<br>
as a syringe and needle.<br>
[049]   The invention further provides the use of parenteral administration of attenuated<br>
Plasmodium species sporozoites as described herein, in the administration of a vaccine for<br>
prevention or reduction of severity of malaria.<br>
[050]   The invention provides partial, enhanced, or full protection of a human who has not<br>
previously been exposed to a malaria-causing pathogen, or has been exposed, but is not fully<br>
protected. The invention may also be used to reduce the chance of developing a malaria<br>
infection, reduce the chance of becoming ill when one is infected, reduce the severity of  the<br>
illness, such as fever, when one becomes infected, reduce the concentration of parasites in the<br>
infected person, or to reduce mortality from malaria when one is exposed to malaria parasites. In<br>
many cases even partial protection is beneficial. For example, a vaccine treatment strategy that<br>
results in any of these benefits of about 30% of a population may have a significant impact on a<br>
the health of a community and of the individuals residing in the community.<br>
[051]   A "vaccine" is a composition of matter comprising a preparation that contains an<br>
infectious agent or its components which is administered to stimulate an immune response that<br>
will protect a person from illness due to that agent. A therapeutic (treatment) vaccine is given<br>
after infection and is intended to reduce or arrest disease progression. A. preventive<br>
(prophylactic) vaccine is intended to prevent initial infection. Agents used in vaccines may be<br>
whole-killed (inactive), live-attenuated (weakened) or artificially manufactured. A vaccine may<br>
further comprise a diluent, an adjuvant, a carrier, or combinations thereof, as would be readily<br>
understood by those in the art.<br>
[052]   A vaccine may be comprised of separate components. As used herein, "separate<br>
components" refers to a situation wherein the term vaccine actually comprises two discrete<br>
vaccines to be administered separately to a subject. In that sense, a vaccine-comprised of<br>
separate components may be viewed as a kit or a package comprising separate vaccine<br>
components. For example, in the context of the instant Invention, a package may comprise an<br>
attenuated sporozoite component and recombinant subunit vaccine component, including but not<br>
limited to a necombinant protein, recombinant virus, recombinant bacteria, recombinant parasite,<br>
DNA vaccine, or RNA vaccine.<br><br>

[053]   An "effective" immunizing dosage may range between 1000 and 10 million<br>
sporozoites, but could be lower if the immunogenicity/potency of the vaccine is increased. The<br>
vaccine may be administered on multiple occasions. An "effective" number of inoculations may<br>
range between 1 and 6 doses within a year, and "booster" doses in subsequent years.<br>

exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. Moreover,<br>
the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described, as such may, of course,<br>
vary. Further, the terminology used to describe particular embodiments is not intended to be<br>
limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by its claims.<br>
[055]   With respect to ranges of values, the invention encompasses each intervening value<br>
between the upper and lower limits of the range to at least a tenth, of tenth lower limit's unit, unless<br>
the context clearly indicates otherwise. Further, the invention encompasses any other stated<br>
intervening values. Moreover, the invention also encompasses ranges excluding either or both of<br>
the upper and lower limits of the range, unless specifically excluded from the stated range.<br>
[056]   Unless defined otherwise, the meanings of all technical and scientific terms used<br>
herein are those commonly under stood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention<br>
belongs. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that any methods and materials<br>
similar or equivalent to those described herein can also be used to practice or test the invention.<br>
Further, all publications mentioned herein are incorporated by reference.<br>
[057]   It must be noted that, as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms<br>
"a," "or," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus,<br>
for example, reference to "an attenuated sporozoite vaccine" includes a plurality of such<br>
sporozoites and reference to "the agent" includes reference to one or more agents and equivalents<br>
thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.<br>
[058]   Further, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, %<br>
purity, and so forth, used in the specification and claims, are modified by the term "about,"<br>
unless otherwise indicated. Accordingly, the numerical parameters set forth in-the specification<br>
and claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties of the<br>
present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine<br>
of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed<br>
in light of the number of reported significant digits, applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
Nonetheless, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as<br>

possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors from the standard<br>
deviation of its experimental measurement.<br>
[059]   Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible<br>
in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the<br>

the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Comparative Infectivity of Intradermal, Intramuscular, Subcutanneous and<br>
Intravenous Injection of Sporozoites<br>
[061 ]   A study was conducted to investigate the comparative infectivity of freshly<br>
dissected sporozoites delivered intradermally (ID), intramuscularly (IM), subcutaneously (SQ) or<br>
intravenously (IV). It is noted that IV administration is considered to be the most reliable<br>
methods for achieving infection.<br>
[062] Methods: BALB/c mice were infected with Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites band-<br>
dissected from salivary glands by ID, IM, SQ, or IV administration. The level of infection was<br>
determined by assessing thick blood films from day 1 through day 14 after administration. The<br>
results are shown in Table I.<br>

[063]   These data demonstrate that it is possible to routinely infect BALB/c mice by<br>
delivery of sporozoites in the skin, muscle, or subcutaneous tissue,<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Comparative Infectivity of Multiple Dose of Sporozoites Administered Intradermally<br>
Intramuscularly, Subcutaneously or Intravenously<br>
[064]   A study was conducted to investigate the comparative infectivity with lesser<br>
numbers of freshly dissected sporozoites than used in Example 1.<br>
[065 ]   Methods: B ALB/c mice infected with Plasmadium yoelii sporozoites hand-<br>
dissected from salivary glands by multiple routes [intradermal (ID), intramuscular (IM),<br>
subcutaneous (SQ) or intravenous (IV)]. Infection was determined by assessing thick blood films<br>
through day 14 after infection. The results are shown in Table II.<br>

[066]   These data show that administration of small numbers of Plosmodium yoelii<br>
sporozoites hand-dissected from salivary glands by the ID, IM, or SQ routes leads to infections<br>
in mice with nearly the same efficiency as as by the IV route. Since we theorize that there is a<br>
direct correlation/assocation between the infectivity of unirradiated sporozoites when<br>
administered by a particular method, and the capacity of these sporozoites when irradiated and<br>
delivered by that method to to elicit protective immunity, these data suggest that it should be<br>
feasible to successfully immunize by the ID, IM, and SQ routes as well as by the standard IV<br>
route.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Protective Efficacy of Single Dose of Irradiated Sporozoites Administered by the<br>
Intradermal, Intramuscular, or Intraveous Routes<br>
[067]   A study was conducted to investigate the comparative protection provided by<br>
immunization with a single dose of 150,000 radiation attenuated sporozoites.   <br>
[068]   Method: BALB/c mice were inoculated with a single dose of 150,000 radiation<br>
attenuated (10,000 Rads/cGy) P. yoelii sporozoites by the ID, IM, or IV routes. The sporozoites<br>
for immunization were obtained by density gradient centrifugation. The inoculated mice were<br>
challenged 10 days later by injection of 100 Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites hand-dissected from<br>

salivary glands. The infections were assessed through day 14 after challenge by thick blood<br>
smear. The level of infection was evaluated on a scale of 1+ (barely detectable) to 4+ (heavy<br>
infection,). The control group received no immunization inoculation. The results are shown in<br>
Table III.<br>
Table III<br>
[069]   These data demonstrate that administration of a single dose of irradiated sporozoites<br>
by the ID and IM routes elicits a protective immune response that provides protection against<br>
sporozoite challenge comparable to the protection seen after administration of a single dose of<br>
irradiated sporozoites by the IV route. This finding was predicted by the infectivity demonstrated<br>
in Examples 1 and 2 above. Inasmuch as IM and ID methods are more easily used with large<br>
numbers of people and the administration can be carried out with much greater safety and ease<br>
than by IV administration, the present invention makes possible the effective immunization of<br>
significant populations with attenuated sporozoites in a manner more facile than heretofore<br>
demonstrated. In fact it makes it possible to coaceive of for the first time a practical attenuated<br>
sporozoite vaccine. Administration of the single dose of irradiated sporozoites led to a dramatic<br>
reduction of parasite burden in the the mice that were challenged, an effect thought by many<br>
malaria vaccinologists to potentially be adequate to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality<br>
of malaria in recipients. However, It did not completely protect against infection.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Protective Efficacy of Three Doses of Irradiated Sporozoites Administered by the<br>
Subcutaneous or Intraveous Routes<br>
[070]   A study was conducted to investigate the comparative protection provided by<br>
immunization with a standard regimen of three doses of radiation attenuated Plasmodium yoelli<br>
sporozoites by the ID or IV routes; a regimen expected to elicit complete protection against<br>
sparozoite challenge.<br>
[071]   Method: BALB/c mice were inoculated with a first dose of 50,000 radiation<br>
attenuated (10,000 RADS/cGy) Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites by the SQ or IV routes. The mice<br>
received two booster doses of 30,000 irradiated sporozoites (total of 110,000 sporozoites divided<br>
into 3 doses). The sporozoites for immunization were obtained by density gradient                   <br>
centrifugation. The inoculated mice were challenged 14 days after last booster dose with 100<br>
Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites hand-dissected from salivary glands. The infections were<br>
assessed through day 14 after challenge by thick blood smear. Infection was assessed as present<br>
or absent The results are shown in Table IV.<br>
[072]   The data in Table IV clearly demonstrate that one can achieve 100% protection<br>
against infection by subcutaneous administration of sporozoites (SQ). These results were<br>
predicted by the results of studies shown in Example 1, Example 2, and Example 3, but for the<br>
first time ever demonstrated in this experiment. Given the comparability in infectivity by the<br>
SQ, ID, and IM routes (Example 2), it seems obvious that administration of sporozoites by those<br>

WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
routes would provide comparable protection. The 100% protection reported in Example 4 stands<br>
in stark contrast to the 0% protection with subcutaneous immunization of A/J mice with radiation<br>
attenuated P, berghei sporozoites reported previously [21]. As stated above we believe that our<br>
discovery was made possible by our recognition that the P. yoelii-BALB/c model is more<br>
relevant to P. falciparum in humans, than is the P. berghei-A/J mouse model system.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Infectivitv of Sporozoites Isolated by Density Gradient Centrifugation as Compared<br>
to by Hand Dissection of Salivary Glands When Administered by the intravenous Route<br>
[073]   In EXAMPLES 3 and 4 the mice were immunized by administration of irradiated<br>
sporozoites that had been isolated by density gradient centrifugation. It had been our assumption<br>
that sporozoites isolated by density gradient centrifugation of the head and thorax of the<br>
mosquitoes are less infective than are sporozoites hand-dissected from salivary glands. If that is<br>
the case, and there is a direct association between the infectivity of sporozoites and their capacity<br>
to elicit protective immunity as stated above (paragraph [068]), then it should require far fewer<br>
sporozoites hand-dissected from salivary glands than sporozoites isolated by density gradient<br>
centrifugation to achieve protective immunity. The inventors therefore first conducted an<br>
experiment comparing the infectivity of P. yoelii sporozoites isolated by density gradient<br>
centrifugation to those isolated by hand dissection of salivary glands .<br>
[074]   Method: P. yoelii sporozoites were isolated from Anopheles Stephensl mosquitoes<br>
by density gradient centrifugation or by hand dissection of salivary glands. BALB/c mice were<br>
inoculated by intravenous injection with differing numbers of sporozoites. The infections were<br>
assessed through day 14 after challenge by thick blood smear. Infection was assesed as present<br>
or absent The results are shown in Table V.<br>
21<br><br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
50% Infection Dose (IP 50)     4.9                            433<br>
[075]   The data in Table V clearly demonstrate that sporozoites hand-dissected from<br>
salivary glands are more infective than are sporozoites isolated by density gradient<br>
centrifugation. The 50% infectious dose is more than 80 times greater for sporozoites isolated by<br>
density gradient centrifugation.  If the hypothesis is correct that the protective efficacy of a lot of<br>
attenuated sporozoites is directly associated with the infectivity of the lot of sporozoites before<br>
they were attenuated, then these data would indicate that the numbers of attenuated sporozoites<br>
required to achieve protection would be substantially less for sporozoites isolated by hand,<br>
dissection of salivary glands sas compared to sporozoites isolated by density gradient<br>
centrifugation which has been the standard way of isolating sporozoites for immunization,<br>
studies in the P. yoelii-BALB/c model system.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Protective Efficacy of Sporozoites Isolated by Density Gradient Centrifugation as<br>
Compared to by Hand Dissection When Administered by the Intravenous Route<br>
[076]   Based on the results of the infectivity experiment in EXAMPLE 5, a protective<br>
efficacy experiment was designed. The protective efficacy of a regimen of irradiated sporozoites<br>
isolated by density gradient centrifugation which was known based on previous-experience to<br>
give 90% protection, was compared to the capacity of much lower doses of irradiated sporozoites<br>
isolated by hand dissection of salivary glands to achieve protective immunity.<br>
[077]   Method: Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with P. yoelii sporozoites were<br>
irradiated with 10,000 Rads/cGy. Sporozoites were isolated by density gradient centrifugation or<br>
by band dissection of salivary glands. BALB/c mice were inoculated by intravenous injection of<br>

WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
three doses of irradiated P. yoelii sporozoites at 2 week intervals. Group 1 received irradiated<br>
sporozoites isolated by density gradient centrifugation (24,000, 8,000, and 8,000 for first,<br>
second, and third doses respectively). Groups 2-5 received sporozoites isolated by hand<br>
dissection of salivary glands, Group 6 received no immunizations. The mice in Groups 1-6 were<br>
challenged with 100 P. yoelii sporozoites isolated by hand-dissection of salivary glands 14 days<br>
after the third immunizing dose. The infections were assessed through day 14 after challenge by<br>
thick blood smear. Infection was assessed as present or absent. The results are shown in Table<br>
VI.<br>
[078]   The data in Table VI demonstrate that mice immunized with a total of 40,000<br>
irradiated P. yoelii sporozoites (24000, 8000, 8000) isolated by density gradient centrifugation<br>
had 90% protection. Mice immunized with a total of 7500 irradiated sporozoites (4500, 1500,<br>
1500) isolated by hand dissection of salivary glands had 100% protection. These data, when<br>
taken with the data in EXAMPLE 5 indicate that there is a direct association between the<br>
inactivity of a preparation of sporozoites, and the protective efficacy they can elicit. In fact it is<br>
not yet clear how low one can go in terms of doses of irradiated, hand-dissected sporozoites, and<br>
still achieve 90%-100% protective efficacy. These data indicate that immunizing with small<br>
23<br><br><br>
WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
doses of irradiated sporozoites, whether by the IV, ID, IM, or SQ routes, will lead to protective<br>
efficacy.<br>
[079]   These data also support the hypothesis that the P. yoelii-BALB/c model system<br>
more closely predicts what occurs in humans with P. falciparum than does the P. berghei-A/J<br>
mouse model system, in part because of the much higher infectivity of sporozoites in the P.<br>
yoelii system. Humans can be fully immunized by the bite of 1000 irradiated, P. falciparum<br>
infected mosquitoes [34]. It is thought that a mosquito inoculates no more than 10 sporozoites<br>
when it feeds [51]. If that is the case, then fully immunized and protected humans are probably<br>
inoculated with only 10,000 sporozoites [50]. In contrast, in the P. berghei-A/J mouse model<br>
system greater than 100,000 sporozoites isolated from hand-dissected salivary glands were used<br>
to achieve protection by intravenous administration, and this immunizing dosage regimen<br>
provided no protection when administered subcutaneously [21]. In Example 6 it is demonstrated<br>
that administration to BALB/c mice of 750G P. yoelii sporozoites isolated by hand dissection of<br>
salivary glands provided 100% protection. The fact that BALB/c mice immunized with<br>
attenuated P. yoelii sporozoites and humans immunized with attenuated P. falclpurum<br>
sporozoites are protected after exposure to similar numbers of attenuated sporozoites, and A/J<br>
mice immunized, with P. berghei sporozoites are immunized with more than 10 times the<br>
quantity of sporozoites, supports our hypothesis that the P. yoelii-BALB/c model will be more<br>
predictive of what will occur in humans than the P. berghei-A/J model system.<br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
[080]   The process of developing an effective, sustainable vaccine against infections like<br>
P. falciparum has proven to be slower, more difficult and complex than expected. There is no<br>
licensed malaria vaccine, but it is now known that immunization with radiation attenuated P .<br>
falciparum sporozoites by the bite of greater than a 1000 infected mosquitoes provides sterile<br>
protective immunity in greater than 90% of immunized individuals for at least 10.5 months<br>
against multiple isolates of P. falciparum from throughout the world. One of the major obstacles<br>
to making this immunization regimen into a vaccine for humans has been the fact that it is not<br>
possible to provide a regulated vaccine to large numbers of individuals by the bite of infected<br>
mosquitoes. Furthermore, work by a number of scientists indicated that excellent protection<br>
could only be achieved in the mouse model system by intravenous administration of attenuated<br>
sporozoites, a method of administration that is not in general used for vaccination, because it is<br>
technically difficult and potentially more dangerous than are standard methods of administration.<br>

WO 2004/045559                                                                                                PCT/US2003/037498<br>
Because methods of administration conventionally used in humans for immunization like<br>
subcutaneous and intramuscular inoculation did not lead to adequate protective immunity in this<br>
mouse model system, it was heretofore not considered possible to develop an attenuated<br>
sporozoite vaccine for humans. Utilizing a different model system than that used by previous<br>
investigators, we have discovered a method of administering sporozoites that leads to high level<br>
protection and is practical, safe, and accepted. This discovery should facilitate utilization of this<br>
method of administering attenuated sporozoites to develop and provide a practical, mass-<br>
delivered attenuated sporozoite malaria vaccine.<br>
