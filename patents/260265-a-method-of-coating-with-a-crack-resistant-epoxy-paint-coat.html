METHOD FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CRACK RESISTANT EPOXY PAINT COAT AND PAINT<br>
COMPOSITIONS SUITABLE FOR SAID METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the establishment of a crack resistant epoxy<br>
paint coat at the surface represented by the interior of the angles formed between structural<br>
elements of a ballast-tank of a partly or fully submersible structure. The present invention<br>
provides improved crack resistance of such an epoxy paint coat by incorporation of specific<br>
types of fibres.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Existing epoxy products for coating a ballast-tank of a partly or fully submersible structure,<br>
such as a vessel or a semi submersible oil rig, show relatively high crack susceptibility when<br>
applied in extreme high dry film thickness. Cracks may occur during launch or during service<br>
in places with too high dry film thickness. Too high dry film thickness is especially observed<br>
in association with the interior of the angles formed between the structural elements, where<br>
the shape of the surface is such that a paint film with even thickness is seldom achieved.<br>
Existing epoxy products are typically specified in a total dry film thickness of 250 - 500um,<br>
but in association with the interior of the angles formed between the structural elements<br>
there is a risk of getting far higher dry film thicknesses than specified. Too high coating<br>
thickness, often exceeding normal acceptance limits, causes high curing shrinkage stress and<br>
may enhance cracking.<br>
The factors leading to cracking of ballast tank coatings are studied in recent articles by<br>
Askheim et al. ("Why do paints crack. Ballast tank coating study focusing on brittleness and<br>
loss of flexibility" Protective Coating Europe, March 2001, pp 49-55) and Lim et al. ("Stress<br>
Analysis and Evaluation of Cracks Developed on the Coatings for Welded Joints of Water<br>
Ballast Tanks" Paper presented at "Corrosion 2005", Houston, USA).<br>
The epoxy coat in a ballast tank is exposed to many stress inducing environmental effects,<br>
E.g. special environmental effects in ballast tanks of vessels include elevated temperature on<br>
areas, such as bulkheads adjacent to cargo holds and engine rooms, cyclic sun-heating<br>
underneath the main deck, water sloshing, reverse impacts from heavy loading equipment,<br>
and hydrostatic pressure changes from ballasting/de-ballasting cycles. The environmental<br>
effects give special demands to the flexibility and cracking resistance of an epoxy coat<br>
applied in the ballast tank of a partly or fully submersible structure. Cracks in the paint film<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
2<br>
will lead to corrosion due to the presence of water, typically sea water, when ballast is<br>
required.<br>
The brittleness of the epoxy coat is believed to be related to limitations in the flexibility of<br>
basic epoxy chemistry. The epoxide group can react with various curing agents. Epoxide<br>
groups can also homopolymerise with themselves to varying degrees. The end result is a<br>
three-dimensional network of long chain molecules with limited flexibility. The flexibility<br>
varies with the type and amount of curing agent as well as type and amount of flexibilisers. If<br>
much more than the stoichiometric amount of curing agent is added to the epoxy resin, the<br>
flexibility is improved, but mechanical strength and anticorrosive properties are reduced.<br>
JP 59-78267A discloses a coating composition comprised of an epoxy resin, a curing agent,<br>
an inorganic staple fiber and a coating compounding agent. The coating composition is mainly<br>
used for a corrosion-proofing coating at the inside and outside of steel pipes.<br>
A method is required for the establishment of a crack resistant epoxy paint coat at the<br>
surface represented by the interior of the angles formed between structural elements of a<br>
ballast tank of a partly or fully submersible structure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, the underlying problem for the present invention is to provide a method for the<br>
establishment of a crack resistant epoxy paint coat at the surface represented by the interior<br>
of the angles formed between structural elements of a ballast tank of a partly or fully<br>
submersible structure, said method comprising:<br>
(i) applying a paint composition comprising an epoxy-based binder system onto said<br>
surface thereby forming a curable paint film on said surface, and<br>
(ii) allowing said curable paint film to cure thereby forming the epoxy paint coat;<br>
wherein the paint composition has a viscosity of at the most 140 KU and comprises<br>
35-80% by solids volume of the paint of an epoxy-based binder system having a ratio<br>
between the hydrogen equivalents and the epoxy equivalents in the range of 20:100 to<br>
120:100, and<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
3<br>
0.5-30% by solids volume of the paint of one or more fibres selected from the group<br>
consisting of natural inorganic fibres, synthetic inorganic fibres, natural organic fibres,<br>
synthetic organic fibres, and metallic fibres, said fibres having an average length, of at<br>
the most 250 urn.<br>
The present invention also relates to paint compositions as such.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a portion of a ballast tank and illustrates the surface represented by the<br>
interior of the angles formed between structural elements of the ballast-tank. For<br>
simplification stiffening members typically present in a ballast tank are not included in figure<br>
1.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the high dry film thickness of the epoxy paint coat that is prone to arise<br>
due to the shape of the surface of a ballast-tank.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that by applying an epoxy paint comprising fibres at the surface<br>
represented by the interior of the angles formed between the structural elements of a ballast-<br>
tank of a partly or fully submersible structure, a crack resistant epoxy paint coat is<br>
established.<br>
More specific, the invention relates to a method for the establishment of a crack resistant<br>
epoxy paint coat at the surface represented by the interior of the angles formed between<br>
structural elements of a ballast tank of a partly or fully submersible structure.<br>
When used herein, the term "interior of the angles formed between structural elements of a<br>
ballast tank" is intended to mean the surface extending 20 cm from both sides of the junction<br>
between structural elements (e.g. metal plates) forming the inner surface of a ballast tank<br>
and representing an angle of between 45Â° to 140Â°. At the surface represented by the interior<br>
of the angles formed between the structural elements there is a problem with too high dry<br>
film thickness that may result in cracking.<br>
Examples of junctions between structural elements forming the inner surface of a ballast tank<br>
and representing an angle of between 45Â°'to 140Â° include, but are not limited to, junctions<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
4<br>
between vertical sides, junctions between vertical sides and the top of a ballast tank,<br>
junctions between vertical sides and the bottom of a ballast tank and junctions between<br>
vertical sides and stiffening members of a ballast tank.<br>
The interior of the angles formed between structural elements of a ballast tank is illustrated<br>
schematically in FIG. 1. Referring to FIG 1 the surface (A), the hatched area extending 20 cm<br>
from both sides of the junctions between the vertical sides (I, II, III), between the vertical<br>
sides (I, II, III) and the tank top (IV) and between the vertical sides (I, II, III) and the tank<br>
bottom (V) is the interior of the angles formed between the structural elements according to<br>
the above definition.<br>
The problem with too high dry film thickness is illustrated schematically in FIG 2. FIG 2 is a<br>
cross cut of a part of the surface (A) of FIG 1 after application of the epoxy paint coat (E).<br>
Structural elements of a ballast tank, e.g. metal plates, such as steel plates, are joined<br>
typically by welding. To construct a ballast tank, it is required that some of the structural<br>
elements are joined to form an interior angle of 45Â° to 140Â°.<br>
When used herein, the term "structural elements of a ballast tank" is intended to include<br>
sides, top, bottom and stiffening members of a ballast tank. Examples of stiffening members<br>
are longitudinals, girders and stringers. Such stiffening members are well known to the<br>
person skilled in the art and detailed examples are given in "Guidance manual for tanker<br>
structures", Tanker Structure Co-operative Forum. Witherby, London 1997, Figure 1.1.<br>
Examples of partly or fully submersible structures are vessels (including but not limited to<br>
boats, ocean liners, tankers, container ships and other cargo ships, submarines and naval<br>
vessels of all types) or semi submersible oil rigs etc.<br>
The method further comprises the steps:<br>
(i) applying a paint composition comprising an epoxy-based binder system onto said<br>
surface thereby forming a curable paint film on said surface, and<br>
. (ii) allowing said curable paint film to cure thereby forming the epoxy paint coat;<br>
The paint composition may be applied by means of any of the usual techniques used within<br>
the paint field. Preferred application techniques are spraying, e.g. airless spraying, and by<br>
means of a brush or a roller.<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
5<br>
The method of the invention is intended to include applications where the epoxy paint is<br>
applied both to the surface represented by the interior of the angles formed between the<br>
structural elements and to other surfaces of the ballast-tank. The epoxy paint may be applied<br>
on the whole surface of the ballast-tank or only on parts of the surface, as long as parts of<br>
the surface applied include parts of the surface represented by the interior of the angles<br>
formed between the structural elements.<br>
Paint composition to be used in the method.<br>
The paint composition to be used in the method of the present invention is a film-forming<br>
paint composition, i.e. the combination of the paint constituents should make it possible to<br>
prepare a film of substantially uniform thickness.<br>
The paint compositions to be used in the method of the present invention need to be<br>
applicable by spray or brush opposed to pastes or similar products. It should therefore be<br>
understood that the paint compositions to be used in the method of the present invention<br>
have a viscosity of at the most 140 Krebs Unit (KU) at the application temperature. The<br>
viscosity is determined just after the paint composition has been mixed and is ready to be<br>
applied. The viscosity is determined according to ASTM D562-01 with the modification that<br>
the temperature of the specimen is the application temperature.<br>
Fibres<br>
Generally, "fibres" is intended to cover any fibres within the groups of natural inorganic<br>
fibres, synthetic inorganic fibres, natural organic fibres, synthetic organic fibres, and metallic<br>
fibres, or mixtures thereof. Without being bound to any specific theory, it is, however,<br>
presently believed that natural inorganic fibres and synthetic inorganic fibres, in particular<br>
mineral fibres of these types, are especially preferred.<br>
It is presently believed that the fibres to be used within the present invention should fulfil<br>
certain criteria with respect to dimensions in order to provide the improved properties of the<br>
paints within the present invention. Thus, with respect to average length and average<br>
thickness of the fibres which are added to the paint during manufacture of the paint or mixed<br>
with the paint before application, such fibres have an average length, of at the most 250 Âµm<br>
and an average thickness of 1-50 Âµm.<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
6<br>
Preferred fibres are fibres having an average thickness of 1-25 Âµm and an average length, of<br>
at the most 250 urn, especially an average length of 25-250 |im and an average thickness of<br>
1-25 Âµm, in particularly an average length of 50-250 Âµm (such as 50-170 urn) and an<br>
average thickness of 2-10 Âµm. The preferred fibres furthermore have a ratio between the<br>
average length and the average thickness of at least 2, such as at least 3 e.g. at least 5.<br>
It should be noted that the term "length" refers to the greatest dimension of the fibre particle<br>
in question. The term "average" when used in connection with length indicates that a certain<br>
variation of the length of fibres exists within the distribution of the fibres used. The term<br>
"average thickness" also refers to the fibres in question, however, with regard to the<br>
distribution of fibres also taking into account the longitudinal and cross-sectional variation<br>
with each individual fibre.<br>
In order for a certain particle to be considered as a fibre within the present context, the ratio<br>
between the greatest dimension and the smallest dimension perpendicular to the length<br>
dimension in substantially all points along the longitudinal axis (the length dimension -<br>
longest dimension) should not exceed 2.5:1, preferably not exceed 2:1. Furthermore, the<br>
ratio between the longest dimension and the second smallest of the two shortest dimensions<br>
should be at least 2:1, preferably at least 5:1. Thus, fibres are characterised of having one<br>
long dimension and two short dimension, where the long dimension is longer than the two<br>
short dimensions (typically by an order of magnitude, or even more), and the two short<br>
dimensions are substantially equal (of the same order of magnitude). For completely regular<br>
fibres, i.e. fibres having a cylindrical shape, it is evident how to determine the "length"<br>
(longest dimension) and the two (identical) shortest dimensions. For more irregular fibres, it<br>
is believed that the relationship between the dimensions can be evaluated by the following<br>
hypothetical experiment: A regular, right-angled box is constructed around the fibre. The box<br>
is constructed so as to have the smallest possible volume as it should fully comprise the<br>
fibre. To the extent that the fibre is curved, it is (again hypothetically) assumed that the fibre<br>
is flexible so that the volume of the hypothetical box can be minimised by "straightening" the<br>
fibre. In order for the "fibre" to be recognised as so in the present context, the ratio between<br>
the two smallest dimensions of the box should be at the most 2.5:1 (preferably 2:1) and the<br>
ratio between the longest dimension of the box and the second smallest of the two smallest<br>
dimensions of the box should be at least 2:1, preferably at least 5:1.<br>
The above is given as a general guideline in order to exclude other types of particles which<br>
may be referred to as "fibres" but which do have less satisfactory properties within the<br>
present invention. In particular, the term "fibre" is not intended to include so-called inorganic<br>
"fibre" materials which are used as fillers (e.g. frayed type fillers with no well defined<br>
dimensions, such as asbestine), cf. Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 11th Ed., (Sax<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
7<br>
and Lewis, eds.), Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, 1987, page 521. Neither does<br>
"fibre" include flake type fillers, e.g. mica, flake shaped clay minerals, aluminium flakes or<br>
glass flakes cf. the definition above. With respect to "curved" fibres, it should be understood<br>
that the length dimension should be considered as the length along the curve defined by the<br>
fibre.<br>
The surface of the fibres may or may not have been modified (surface treated) by chemical<br>
or physical processes. Examples of such modification processes used to improve the<br>
beneficial effects of the fibres are carbonisation; silylation; surface oxidation; etching, such<br>
as treatment with alkali metal hydroxide, treatment with hydrofluoric acid; coating; poly<br>
electrolytic entrapment in the porous surface structures; adsorption processes; hydrogen-<br>
bonding processes; cationic bonding processes; esterification; anionic bonding processes;<br>
etc. as well as any modification processes included in the manufacturing of the fibres.<br>
In an interesting embodiment, the fibres to be incorporated in the paints are biodegradable<br>
under physiological conditions, especially in the respiratory organs (the lungs) of mammals,<br>
especially humans. Thus, it is believed that especially interesting fibres are those which are<br>
able to biodegrade when present in a modified Gamble's solution as defined in WO 96/14454,<br>
page 9. The degree of biodegradability should preferably be at least 20 nm/day, such as at<br>
least 30 nm/day, in particular at least 50 nm/day when tested as described in WO 96/14454.<br>
Examples of suitable biodegradable fibres are the ones described in WO 96/14454 and WO<br>
96/14274. A specific example thereof is the commercially available MS 600 Roxul 1000, ex.<br>
Lapinus Fibres BV (see below). The biodegradability is especially relevant for mineral fibres.<br>
The fibres may, as it will be clear from the description of the manufacture processes further<br>
below, be added together with the remaining paint constituents before milling or the fibres<br>
may be added afterwards. It can, however, be expected that the average length of the fibres<br>
will be somewhat reduced during the paint manufacture process (see further below), e.g. due<br>
to the applied shear forces and/or milling process. (Milling and intensive stirring is typically<br>
performed in order to break up agglomerates of pigments and other particles in the paint<br>
composition). It is believed that the paint manufacture process should preferably be<br>
performed so that the fibres in the ready-to-use paint have an average length corresponding<br>
to at least 75% of the pre-manufacture average length.<br>
The concentration of the fibres is normally in the range of 0.5-30% by solids volume of the<br>
paint, such as 0.5-20% by solids volume of the paint. Especially relevant concentrations of<br>
fibres, depending upon the type and size of the fibres, may be 2-20%, such as 3-18%, such<br>
as 5-15% by solids volume of the paint.<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
8<br>
It should be understood that the above ranges refer to the total amount of fibres, thus, in the<br>
case where two or more fibre types are utilised, the combined amounts should fall within the<br>
above ranges.<br>
Inorganic fibres<br>
Generally, "inorganic fibres" is intended to cover any fibres within the groups of natural<br>
inorganic fibres, synthetic inorganic fibres, and metallic fibres, or mixtures thereof. Without<br>
being bound to any specific theory, it is, however, presently believed that natural inorganic<br>
fibres and synthetic inorganic fibres, in particular mineral fibres of these types, are especially<br>
preferred.<br>
By mineral fibres should be understood fibres made using minerals as starting materials.<br>
According to this definition, mineral fibres include both crystalline materials as well as<br>
amorphous materials formed by a melting process.<br>
In the present invention, preferred inorganic fibres are inorganic fibres having an average<br>
thickness of 1-25 Âµm and an average length, of at the most 250 Âµm, especially an average<br>
length of 25-250 Âµm and an average thickness of 1-25 Âµm, in particularly an average length<br>
of 50-250 Âµm (such as 50-170 Âµm) and an average thickness of 2-20 Âµm (such as 2-10 Âµm).<br>
The preferred inorganic fibres furthermore have a ratio between the average length and the<br>
average thickness of at least 2, such as at least 5, preferably a ratio between the average<br>
length and the average thickness of at least 10, in particularly at least 15, such as at least<br>
20.<br>
Examples of inorganic fibres are carbide fibres, such as silicon carbide fibres, boron carbide<br>
fibres, niobium carbide fibres; nitride fibres, such as silicon nitride fibres; boron containing<br>
fibres, such as boron fibres, boride fibres; silicon-containing fibres, such as silicon fibres,<br>
alumina-boron-silica fibres, E-glass (non-alkaline alumoborosilicate) fibres, C-glass (non-<br>
alkaline or low-alkaline soda lime-alumoborosilicate) fibres, A-glass (alkaline soda lime-<br>
silicate) fibres, S-glass fibres, CEMFIL-glass fibres, ARG-glass fibres, mineral-glass fibres,<br>
non-alkaline magnesia alumosilicate fibres, quartz fibres, silicic acid fibres, silica fibres, high-<br>
silica fibres, alumina high-silica fibres, alumosilicate fibres, aluminium silicate fibres,<br>
magnesia alumosilicate fibres, soda borosilicate fibres, soda silicate fibres, polycarbosilane<br>
fibres, polytitanocarbosilane fibres, poiysilazane fibres, hydridopolysilazane fibres,<br>
tobermorite fibres, samarium silicate fibres, wollastonite fibres, potassium aluminium silicate<br>
fibres; metal fibres, such as iron fibres, aluminium fibres, steel fibres, iron fibres, zinc fibres;<br>
carbon fibres, such as pure carbon fibres, graphite fibres, slagwool fibres, charcoal fibres;<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
9<br>
rockwool fibres, such as pure rockwool fibres and basalt rockwool fibres; processed mineral<br>
fibres from mineral wool; volcanic rock fibres; attapulgite fibres; etc.; modified by any<br>
chemical or physical processes; and any mixture thereof.<br>
It is presently believed that one very interesting group of fibres is inorganic fibres, in<br>
particular mineral fibres. Particularly preferred examples of such fibres are silicon-containing<br>
fibres; metal fibres; oxide fibres; carbon fibres; rockwool fibres; processed mineral fibres<br>
from mineral wool; volcanic rock fibres; wollastonite fibres; tobermorite fibres; attapulgite<br>
fibres.<br>
At present, especially preferred are mineral fibres, such as mineral-glass fibres, wollastonite<br>
fibres, tobermorite fibres, attapulgite fibres, volcanic rock fibres, bauxite fibres, rockwool<br>
fibres, and processed mineral fibres from mineral wool. Examples of commercially available<br>
mineral fibres which are believed to improve the mechanical properties according to the<br>
invention are (average fibre length in Âµm; average fibre thickness in Âµm):<br>

Epoxy-based binder system<br>
The term "epoxy-based binder system" should be construed as the combination of the one or<br>
more epoxy resins, one or more curing agents, any reactive epoxy diluents and any reactive<br>
acrylic modifiers.<br>
The epoxy-based binder system is one of the most important constituents of the paint<br>
composition, in particular with respect to the anticorrosive properties. Besides the<br>
anticorrosive properties, it is relevant that the epoxy paint coat resulting from the application<br>
of the paint composition is flexible.<br>
The epoxy-based binder system comprises one or more epoxy resins selected from aromatic<br>
or non-aromatic epoxy resins (e.g. hydrogenated epoxy resins), containing more than one<br>
epoxy group per molecule, which is placed internally, terminally, or on a cyclic structure,<br>
together with one or more suitable curing agents to act as cross-linking agents. Combinations<br>
with reactive diluents from the classes mono functional glycidyl ethers or esters of aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic or aromatic compounds can be included in order to reduce viscosity and for<br>
improved application and physical properties. The binder system can also include reactive<br>
acrylic modifiers, such as acrylate monomers and oligomers comprising at least two alpha,<br>
beta unsaturated carbonyl groups, reacting with the one or more curing agents via a Michael-<br>
type addition reaction.<br>
Suitable epoxy-based binder systems are believed to include epoxy and modified epoxy<br>
resins selected from bisphenol A, bisphenol F, Novolac epoxies, non-aromatic epoxies,<br>
cycloaliphatic epoxies, glycidyl esters and epoxy functional acrylics or any combinations<br>
hereof. Examples of suitable commercially available epoxy resins are:<br>

The epoxy-based binder system comprises one or more curing agents selected from<br>
compounds or polymers comprising at least two reactive hydrogen atoms linked to nitrogen.<br>
Suitable curing agents are believed to include amines or amino functional polymers selected<br>
from aliphatic amines and polyamines (e.g. cycloaliphatic amines and polyamines),<br>
polyamidoamines, polyoxyalkylene amines (e.g. polyoxyalkylene diamines), aminated<br>
polyalkoxyethers (e.g. those sold commercially as "Jeffamines"), alkylene amines (e.g.<br>
alkylene diamines), aralkylamines, aromatic amines, Mannich bases (e.g. those sold<br>
commercially as "phenalkamines"), amino functional silicones or silanes, and including epoxy<br>
adducts and derivatives thereof. Examples of suitable commercially available curing agents<br>
are:<br>

Preferred epoxy-based binder systems comprises a) one or more epoxy resins selected from<br>
bisphenol A, bisphenol F and Novolac; and b) one or more curing agents selected from<br>
Mannich Bases, polyamidoamines, polyoxyalkylene amines, alkylene amines, aralkylamines,<br>
polyamines, and adducts and derivatives thereof.<br>
Especially preferred epoxy-based binder systems comprise one or more bisphenol A epoxy<br>
resins and one or more curing agents selected from Mannich Bases, polyamidoamines and<br>
adducts and derivatives thereof.<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
15<br>
Preferably, the epoxy resin has an epoxy equivalent weight of 100-2000, such as 100-1500,<br>
e.g. 150-1000, such as 150-700.<br>
Especially preferred epoxy-based binder systems comprise one or more bisphenol A epoxy<br>
resins having an epoxy equivalent weight of 150-700 and one or more polyamidoamine or<br>
adducts and derivatives thereof.<br>
Preferred epoxy-based binder systems are ambient curing binder systems.<br>
In the paint composition, the total amount of epoxy-based binder system is in the range of<br>
15-80%, such as 35-80%, e.g. 40-75% by solids volume of the paint.<br>
Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the selection of the ratio<br>
between the hydrogen equivalents of the one or more curing agents and the epoxy<br>
equivalents of the one or more epoxy resins plays a certain role for the performance of the<br>
coating composition.<br>
When used herein, the term "hydrogen equivalents" is intended to cover only reactive<br>
hydrogen atoms linked to nitrogen.<br>
The number of "hydrogen equivalents" in relation to the one or more curing agents is the<br>
sum of the contribution from each of the one or more curing agents. The contribution from<br>
each of the one or more curing agents to the hydrogen equivalents is defined as grams of the<br>
curing agent divided by the hydrogen equivalent weight of the curing agent, where the<br>
hydrogen equivalent weight of the curing agent is determined as: grams of the curing agent<br>
equivalent to 1 mole of active hydrogen. For adducts with epoxy resins the contribution of<br>
the reactants before adductation is used for the determination of the number of "hydrogen<br>
equivalents" in the epoxy-based binder system.<br>
The number of "epoxy equivalents" in relation to the one or more epoxy resins is the sum of<br>
the contribution from each of the one or more epoxy resins. The contribution from each of<br>
the one or more epoxy resins to the epoxy equivalents is defined as grams of the epoxy resin<br>
divided by the epoxy equivalent weight of the epoxy resin, where the epoxy equivalent<br>
weight of the epoxy resin is determined as: grams of the epoxy resin equivalent to 1 mole of<br>
epoxy groups. For adducts with epoxy resins, the contribution of the reactants before<br>
adductation is used for the determination of the number of "epoxy equivalents" in the epoxy-<br>
based binder system.<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
16<br>
It should be understood that if the epoxy-based binder system contains reactive acrylic<br>
modifiers then the number of "epoxy equivalents" is to be increased accordingly. E.g. if the<br>
epoxy-based binder system contains an acrylate oligomer comprising alpha, beta unsaturated<br>
carbonyl groups then the number of "alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl group equivalents"<br>
are to be added to the epoxy equivalents of the one or more epoxy resins for the purpose of<br>
establishing the ratio between the hydrogen equivalents of the one or more curing agents<br>
and the epoxy equivalents of the one or more epoxy resins.<br>
Preferably, the ratio between the hydrogen equivalents of the one or more curing agents and<br>
the epoxy equivalents of the one or more epoxy resins is in the range of 20:100 to 120:100.<br>
Especially preferred epoxy-based binder systems for use in ballast tank coatings have a ratio<br>
between the hydrogen equivalents of the one or more curing agents and the epoxy<br>
equivalents of the one or more epoxy resins in the range of 60:100 to 120:100, such as<br>
70:100 to 110:100.<br>
Other constituents<br>
It has previously been common to include coal-tar in epoxy paint compositions. However due<br>
to a suspected carcinogenic effect it is preferred that epoxy paint compositions do not contain<br>
coal-tar. The presence of coal-tar furthermore makes it difficult to make light shades. Light<br>
shades are preferred in ballast-tanks to facilitate inspection for possible damages to the paint<br>
film. Thus, in a preferred embodiment the coating composition comprises 0% by solids<br>
volume of the paint of coal-tar.<br>
The paint composition may comprise plasticizers. Examples of plasticizers are hydrocarbon<br>
resins, phthalates and benzyl alcohol. In one preferred embodiment, the paint composition<br>
comprises a hydrocarbon resin as plasticizer.<br>
In the paint composition, the total amount of plasticizers (e.g. hydrocarbon resins) may be in<br>
the range of 0-30%, such as 0-25% by solids volume of the paint, preferably 1-25%, such as<br>
1-20% by solids volume of the paint.<br>
The paint composition may comprise other paint constituents as will be apparent for the<br>
person skilled in the art. Examples of such paint constituents are pigments, fillers, additives<br>
(e.g. epoxy accelerators, surfactants, wetting agents and dispersants, de-foaming agents,<br>
catalysts, stabilizers, corrosion inhibitors, coalescing agents, thixothropic agents (such as<br>
 polyamide waxes), anti-settling agents and dyes).<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
17<br>
In the paint composition, the total amount of pigments and fillers may be in the range of 0-<br>
50%, such as 5-50% by solids volume of the paint, preferably 10-45%, such as 10-40% by<br>
solids volume of the paint.<br>
It is envisaged that certain pigments and fillers have a beneficial effect on the anticorrosive<br>
properties. Examples are aluminium pigments, zinc phosphate and mica. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the paint composition comprises 0-10% by solids volume of the paint of<br>
aluminium pigments, preferably 1-7%, such as 2-6% by solids volume of the paint. In an<br>
. alternative embodiment, the composition comprises at the most 10% by dry weight of the<br>
paint of aluminium pigments.<br>
In the paint composition, the total amount of additives may be in the range of 0-10%, such<br>
as 0.1-8% by solids volume of the paint.<br>
The paint composition may comprise epoxy accelerators. Examples are substituted phenols,<br>
such as 2,4,6-tris (dimethylamino methyl) phenol, p-tert-butylphenol, nonyl phenol etc.<br>
The paint composition typically comprises a solvent or solvents. Examples of solvents are<br>
alcohols, such as water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol and<br>
benzyl alcohol; alcohol/water mixtures, such as ethanol/water mixtures; aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as white spirit, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene<br>
and naphtha solvent; ketones, such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone,<br>
methyl isoamyl ketone, diacetone alcohol and cyclohexanone; ether alcohols, such as 2-<br>
butoxyethanol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether and butyl diglycol; esters, such as<br>
methoxypropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Depending on the application technique, it is desirable that the paint comprises solvent(s) so<br>
that the solids volume ratio (SVR - ratio between the volume of solid constituents to the total<br>
volume) is in the range of 30-100%, preferably 50-100%, in particular 55-100% e.g. 60-<br>
100%.<br>
SVR is determined according to ISO 3233 or ASTM D 2697 with the modification that drying<br>
is carried out at 20Â°C and 60% relative humidity for 7 days instead of drying at higher<br>
temperatures.<br><br>

18<br>
Preparation of the paint composition<br>
The paint may be prepared by any suitable technique that is commonly used within the field<br>
of paint production. Thus, the various constituents may be mixed together using a high speed<br>
disperser, a ball mill, a pearl mill, a three-roll mill etc. The paints according to the invention<br>
may be filtrated using bag filters, patron filters, wire gap filters, wedge wire filters, metal<br>
edge filters, EGLM tumoclean filters (ex. Cuno), DELTA strain filters (ex. Cuno), and Jenag<br>
Strainer filters (ex. Jenag), or by vibration filtration.<br>
The paint composition to be used in the method of the invention is prepared by mixing two or<br>
more components e.g. two pre-mixtures, one pre-mixture comprising the one or more epoxy<br>
resins and one pre-mixture comprising the one or more curing agents. It should be<br>
understood that when reference is made to the paint composition, it is the mixed paint<br>
composition ready to be applied. Furthermore, all amounts stated as % by solids volume of<br>
the paint should be understood as % by solids volume of the mixed paint composition ready<br>
to be applied.<br>

advantageously be used in methods for establishing a crack resistant epoxy paint coat in for<br>
example cargo holds and liquid storage tanks, such as water tanks and chemical tanks, and<br>
for establishing crack resistant epoxy paint coat on for example Rail cars, Containers,<br>
Bridges, cranes and Wind turbines.<br>
Liquid storage tank<br>
In one preferred embodiment, a novel epoxy paint composition defined herein for the method<br>
of the invention is used in a method for establishing a crack resistant epoxy paint coat on the<br>
interior surface of a liquid storage tank, said method comprising<br>

surface of the interior of a liquid storage tank thereby forming a curable paint film<br>
on said surface, and<br>
(ii) allowing said curable paint film to cure thereby forming the epoxy paint coat;<br>
wherein the paint composition has a viscosity of at the most 140 Ku and comprises:<br><br>

Some types of liquid storage tanks require a high degree of chemical resistance. To ensure a<br>
high degree of chemical resistance, epoxy paint compositions used in a method for<br>
establishing a crack resistant epoxy paint coat in a liquid storage tank where a high degree of<br>
chemical resistance is required, should preferably comprise one or more novolac epoxy resins<br>
and/or bisphenol F resins.<br>

Methods<br>
Preparation of test panels<br>
Where not specifically stated elsewhere, the test panels used are applied according to the<br>
procedure stated below.<br>
Steel panels are coated with 2x150 Âµm (dry film thickness) of the paint to be tested by<br>
airless spraying with a recoat interval of 24 hours between the two coats. The steel panels<br>
used are all cold rolled mild steel, abrasive blasted to Sa 3 (ISO 8501-1), with a surface<br>
profile equivalent to BN 10 (Rugotest No. 3). After the samples have been coated, the panels<br>
are conditioned at a temperature of 23Â±2Â°C and 50Â±5% relative humidity for a period of 7<br>
days if not otherwise stated.<br>
The thermal cycling resistance test<br>
This method is conducted according to the IMace standard TG 260. It is an accelerated<br>
thermal fatigue test, in which a coating is subjected to fast, and extreme temperature<br>
changes, thereby inducing thermal and mechanical fatigue within the coating. It is. conducted<br>
in a programmable temperature controlled oven, capable of reaching upper and lower<br>
temperatures of +60Â°C to -30Â°C, within a two hour time period. The panels used are steel<br>
panels in v-shape prepared by bending a steel plate (100x200x1.5mm) 90Â° along the central<br>
axis lengthwise. An even layer of the paint composition is applied by airless spraying from a<br>
20-30 cm distance on to the surface representing the 90Â° angle, aiming to achieve an<br>
average dry film thickness of approximately 1000 um. The maximum dry film thickness which<br>
is obtained in the bottom of the V is stated for each of the paint compositions in the relevant<br>
tables. The distribution of the dry film thickness along the surface depends on how the panel<br>
is positioned during spray application and drying. Two variants are used:<br>
Variant A: The panel to be applied is placed so that each side of the V-shaped panel forms a<br>
45Â° angle with horizontal.<br>
Variant B: The panel to be applied is placed on a plate with one of the sides of the V-shaped<br>
panel in full contact with the plate and oriented horizontally in respect of the earth.<br>
The variant used appears from the relevant tables.<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
26<br>
After coatings are applied, the panels shall be post cured at 60Â°C for one week to dry out any<br>
volatile components before running the thermal cycling test. During drying and post curing,<br>
the panel is placed as during application. At each inspection, the samples are removed to be<br>
examined under microscope for any cracks in the coating.<br>
The tensile strength test<br>
The test method is based on ASTM D 2370-92. It covers the procedure for assessing the<br>
relative elongation, the tensile strength, and the stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of a coating<br>
of paint, varnish or related product when tested as a free film and subjected to testing in a<br>
tensile strength test machine under standard conditions. The tensile strength test is<br>
performed on a Zwick Universal Testing Machine Z2.5/TN1S equipped with load cells of 50,<br>
500, or 2500 N. The coating (2x150 um dry film thickness) is applied on overhead foil which<br>
is cut into test strips of 20xl00mm 24 hours after application of final layer of coating. The<br>
overhead foil is subsequently removed from the strips, leaving test strips of free coating film.<br>
After a sample has been conditioned, it is clamped in the test machine sample holders. One<br>
sample holder has a fixed position and the other is moved away at a constant speed of 10<br>
mm per min. The paint sample is elongated until breakage of the sample occurs, and the<br>
values of stress (force/area) and strain (elongation) are recorded. The higher stress value the<br>
better tensile strength, the higher elongation the more flexible. The procedure is repeated in<br>
triplicate for each of the test films made. The average elongation until breakage is calculated.<br>
The average elongation for the reference composition without fibres is set to 100.<br>
The pull-off test<br>
Pull-off test according to ISO 4624 (ASTM D 4541) with P.A.T hydraulic adhesion tester. This<br>
test covers the determination of the pull-off strength of a coating or coating system, by<br>
determining the greatest perpendicular force (in tension) that a surface area can bear, before<br>
a plug of material is detached. Failure will occur along the weakest plane within the system<br>
comprised of the test fixture, adhesive coating system and substrate. After the panels have<br>
been coated and conditioned, a steel pin doll with a surface area of 1.58 cm2 is glued onto<br>
the paint surface on the test panel (150x200x1.5 mm) with Standard Araldit glue, cured for<br>
24 hours. After curing of the glue, the paint film is cut free around the dolls down to the<br>
substrate and the dolls are pulled off using the P.A.T hydraulic adhesion tester. The pull-off<br>
value (tensile strength) is noted, and converted in relation to the area of the doll and stated<br>
in MPa. The type of rupture is also noted (cohesive/adhesive). The pull-off value for the<br>
reference composition without fibres is set to 100.<br><br>
WO 2006/119770	PCT/DK2006/000249<br>
27<br>
The impact test<br>
Impact (effect of rapid deformation), according to ISO 6272-1, Falling-weight test, large-area<br>
indenter using an Erichsen Impact Tester. This test method covers a procedure for rapidly<br>
deforming by impact a coating film and its substrate and for evaluating the effect of such<br>
deformation. After the panels have been cured and conditioned, a falling-weight of 1 kg, with<br>
an indenter-head of 20 mm 0, is dropped a distance onto the test panel (150x100x1.5 mm).<br>
The panel is supported by a steel fixture, with a hole of 27 mm 0, centred under the<br>
indenter. When the indenter strikes the panel, it deforms the coating and the substrate. By<br>
gradually increasing the distance, the weight drops, the point at which failure usually occurs<br>
can be determined. The impact value is reported as the highest impact, reproduced 5 times,<br>
which results in no visible cracks and no adhesion failure in the paint film. The impact value<br>
is stated as kg.m (Joule). A possible rupture is evaluated as cohesive or adhesive.<br>
Preparation of test paints<br>
The base component of a commercial paint was thoroughly stirred, fibres were added and the<br>
composition was mixed on a Diaf dissolver for 15 minutes at 1,000 rpm to a homogenous<br>
mixture. Just before the application, the commercial curing agent was added and the paint<br>
composition was mixed to a homogenous mixture. The materials as well as the ratios used<br>
appear from Tables 1-3. The results are shown in Tables 4-11.<br><br>

very demanding test. Typically a commercial product, e.g. HEMPADUR PRO 45601-19870, will<br>
start cracking after 200 to 250 cycles at specified dft. The test can be used to establish the<br><br>
