				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of S-N,N"-bis[2-hydroxy-l-(hydroxymethyl)-ethy1]-5-[(2-hydroxy-l-oxo-propyl)amino 3-2,4,6-triio-do-1,3-benzenedicarboxamide of formula (I), more commonly known as lopamidol, one of the most widely marketed iodinated contrast, comprising a novel step for the synthesis of the intermediate S-N,N"-bisC2-hydro-xy-l-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-[(2-(acetyloxy)-1-oxopropyl)ami-no3-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benz6nedicarboxamide of formula (11).<br><br>
The synthesis of lopamidol was first described in GB 1,472,050 and it involves the steps represented in the following Scheme:<br><br><br>
The work up of the reaction mixture, described in the cited Patent, comprises evaporating dimethyl-acetamide, suspending the oily residue in methylene chloride, repeatedly taking up the precipitate with hot<br><br>
methylene chloride.<br>
The resulting residue is then hydrolysed to lopamidol with NaOH, the subsequent treatment of the resulting solution with a cationic and an anionic resin allows to purify it from the salts before recrystallizing from ethyl alcohol.<br>
The main problems with this process are the following:<br>
the distillation of the solvent under vacuum at the end of  the  reaction  is  a  quite  troublesome . operation from the industrial point of view, DMAC being a high boiling product (165"C); the use of DMAC gives rise to N-C2-hydroxy-l-(hy-droxymethyl)ethyl]-N *-dimethyl-5-[(2-hydroxy-oxo-propyl)amino]-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-ben2enedicarboxa-mide, (hereinafter referred to as impurity I).<br><br>
one of the seven impurities of lopamidol described in Pharmeuropa, vol. 6, n"4, December 1994, pages 343-345, which is ascribable essentially to the production of dimethylamine by DMAC during the work up of the reaction;<br>
moreover, the use of such a high boiling solvent is quite troublesome and difficult so that solvent traces remain in the recovered solid product, which<br><br>
traces, however, have not to exceed 650 ppm (USP limit for lopamidol).<br>
A first attempt to replace DMAC was made by GB<br>
2,272,218 (priority 27.10.1992), in which the preparation of only compound (II) is described, using solvents different from DMAC, i.e. acetone or lower (Cj’-C’) alcohols, in the presence of a base, preferably tributylamine.<br>
As acknowledged by the inventors themselves in the subsequently published patent application GB 2,311,524, . which will be discussed in the following, lopamidol obtained from intermediate (II), in spite of his having an acceptable purity grade, also had different impurities instead of the impurity I.<br>
Physicians and the authorities which grant drug marketing authorizations, require drugs with very low levels of impurities in order to minimize any involved risks of side-effects or toxic effects for the patient.<br>
As far as iodinated contrast agents are concerned, such a requirement is due to the total amount of administered product, which is much higher than that of other medicaments. By way of example, the injected dose of contrast agent can reach and even exceed 150 g.<br>
lopamidol has, in fact, recently undergone a change in its pharmacopoeia requirements, (Italian Pharmacopoeia IX, 3rd revision 1994; US Pharmacopoeia XXIII, 5th revision, 15/11/1996) and it has now to contain at most 0.25% of impurities.<br>
The recently published British patent application<br>
" ,GB  2,311,524  (priority  29.03.1996),  discloses  an<br>
alternative approach  to obtain  lopamidol with such<br><br>
purity characteristics.<br>
GB 2,311/524 describes the preparation of compound (I), using N-methylpyrrolidone as reaction solvent, in the presence of a base, preferably selected from serinol, tributylamine, triethylamine or an inorganic carbonate, claiming a higher purity of the obtained compound {II), which is reflected in the final purity of loparaidol.<br>
The preferred process involves the reaction of compound (III) with serinol in N-methylpyrrolidone, in the presence of previously purified triethylamine or of sodium carbonate. The subsequent treatment of the resulting crude through a battery of ion exchange resins (strong cationic, weak anionic, strong anionic, weak anionic, as described in GB 2,287,024) yields the final compound lopamidol, with a declared purity in accordance with the revisioned pharmacopoeia requirements.<br>
It is therefore evident from the study of the prior art the impelling exigency of:<br>
avoiding the presence of DMAC, thereby also improving the profile of the impurities present in lopamidol as well as the carrying out of the industrial process;<br>
easily removing the reaction solvent: N-methylpyrrolidone belongs, in fact, to the same class of dipolar aprotic solvent as DMAC and, having a similar high boiling point, is therefore difficult to remove completely.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that lopamidol fulfilling the pharmacopoeia requirements can be prepared by the process of the invention comprising:<br><br>
a novel method for "‘the preparation of compound<br>
(II);<br>
the easy transformation of the resulting compound<br>
(II)  into  lopamidol  without  involving  basic<br>
hydrolysis   neither   complex   chromatographic<br>
treatments.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention the preparation of compound (I) comprising the formation of compound (II) by reacting compound (III) with only serinol in a solvent selected from a lower alcohol and . monoalkyl ether glycols of the class of alkylcellosolves and cyclic, straight or branched alkyl ethers.<br>
"Lower alcohol" means a straight or branched C2-C5 alcohol, preferably a secondary alcohol. Particularly preferred are t-butanol and sec-butanol.<br>
Glycols are preferably comprised from Cj and C’, ethoxyethanol and methoxyethanol being particularly preferred.<br>
Cyclic, straight or branched alkyl ethers are ‘4~’10" ‘‘‘ they are preferably selected from the group consisting of: dioxane, diglyme and methyl tert-butyl ether.<br>
We have surprisingly found that the reaction carried out without the addition of a base, in particular tributylamine as in the prior art, and in an alcoholic or ether solvent, allows to effectively overcome the above mentioned problems related to the presence of DMAC, at the same time providing a final product with the purity characteristics in accordance with, or even better than, the present pharmacopoeia requirements.<br><br>
As    already    discusseu    in    GB    patent     application<br>
i<br>
2,3.11,524 (as well as described in WO 9214539) it" was already known in the prior art that the reaction can be carried out without the use of a base, using more than 4 equivalents of serinol, which thus acts as • an acceptor of the hydrochloric acid formed during the reaction itself. The reaction is, however, carried out in DMAC, thus involving the problems mentioned above,<br>
GB 2,311,524 itself envisages the possible use of a serinol excess as a base (see Example 1, serinol/compound (II) molar ratio = 4.36:1), but the solvent is anyway N-methylpyrrolidone and in all the described examples the reaction is carried out under nitrogen atmosphere, which is not a condition easy to reproduce industrially, and the subsequent hydrolysis* process to lopamidol involves a troublesome step through different ion exchange columns.<br>
We have surprisingly found that when serinol is added in a molar ratio to compound (III) ranging from 6 to 25., preferably from 8 to 15, the addition of a base for the subsequent hydrolysis of compound (II) to lopamidol is no longer necessary.<br>
The reaction temperature can range from -10"C to 100"C, preferably from 48 to 85"C, in this last range the reaction time being surprisingly reduced to 1 - 6h.<br>
At the end of the reaction between serinol and compound (III), checked by HPLC analysis, the solvent is distilled off to dryness at a temperature from 40 to 100"C, under a pressure of 10-20 mbar, thus completing the reaction. After that, the acetate group is hydrolysed by addition of water, preferably in amounts<br><br>
of 2 to 4 kg of water per mole of compound (III), being the solution already basic due to the presence of the serinol excess.<br>
Then the solution is brought to 50-70"C, preferably 55-6 5*0, keeping said temperature for a time from 4 to 8h, preferably from 5 to 7h. Finally the solution is neutralized by addition of HCl.<br>
Operating according to the process of the present invention, the final reaction mixture contains,  in addition  to  compound  (I),  only  serinol,  serinol. hydrochloride and serinol acetate.<br>
In this way, the only present cation is serinol, thereby improving the desalting process as well as the lopamidol purification.<br>
The absence in the final solution of dipolar aprotic solvents, which are, on the contrary, always present in the prior art, allows to carry out the purification of compound (I) without using rather expensive industrial equipments, such as the nanofiltration unit for the preliminary desalting and removal of DMAC (see WO 9214539) or the column battery mentioned above for N-methylpyrrolidone (see GB 2,311,524).<br>
The process of the invention includes a chromatographic purification on a conventional column comprising a solid phase selected from the group consisting of macroporous highly cross-linked styrene resins, preferably Amberlite’’) XAD 1600, 1600 T and 16 (Rohm &amp; Haas) or equivalents marketed by other manufacturers.<br>
Eiution is carried out with water, washing until<br><br>
disappearance of the compound, checked by UV analysis.<br>
After concentration of the aqueous phase, desalting is performed by means of a battery (in series or in mixed bed) consisting of a strong cationic resin of sulfonic type, regenerated in the acidic form, and a mean anionic resin of the secondary amine type, regenerated in the OH"" form.<br>
The preferred cationic resins are selected from the group  consisting of:  Dowex  C  350,  Amberjet  1200, Amberlite IR 120. The preferred anionic resin is Relite . MG 1.<br>
The desalted solution is concentrated and purified by crystallization from a suitable solvent, as already known in literature (GB 1,472,050, GB 2,708,601, US<br>
5,689,002, WO 97/02235, EP 747344).<br>
*<br>
Serinol is recovered simply by displacement from the above cationic resin with a 4% ammonia solution. The ammonia eluate is concentrated under vacuum to remove water and ammonia and then crystallized according to the procedures described in Italian patent application MI 96 A 002546.<br>
The recovered product has such a quality as to be used in the process of the present invention (see Experimental section).<br>
lopamidol obtained by the process of the invention has an impurity content not higher than 0.25%, obtained by HPLC analysis, as described in the Pharmacopoeia (see above). No DMAC from previous preparation steps of compound (III), neither other residual solvents (from other synthetic steps) are detected, traces of the process solvent being present in amounts not higher than<br><br>
the requirements established by ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) concerning the presence of residual solvents in pharmaceuticals.<br>
The absence of DMAC or other dipolar aprotic solvents reduces the presence of the crystallization solvent to about one third compared with the prior art, as the dipolar aprotic solvent no longer retains the solvents.<br>
Furthermore, the use of serinol as the base, in addition to removing impurity I, also reduces the risk of  formation  of  S-N,N"-bis[2-hydroxy-l-(hydroxyme-thy 1 )ethyl3-5-araino-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzen6dicarboxa-mide of formula (IV)<br><br>
in which a free amino group is present, such compound therefore belonging to the harmful class of aromatic amines and being very difficult to separate from compound (I) once it is formed. The decrease in this by¬product in the process of the invention is likely due to the lower basicity of serinol in the complementary hydrolysis reaction of the amide with lactic acid at the 5- position.<br>
The following examples illustrate the best experimental conditions to carry out the process of the<br><br>
invention. Experimental section<br>

(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-[(2-hydroxy-1 -oxopropyl)amino]-	2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-<br>
benzenedicarboxamide (I), comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	formation of S-N ,N"-bis[2-hydroxy-l-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-[(2-<br>
(acetyloxy)-1 -oxo-propyl)amino]-2,4,6-trii- odo-1,3-benzenedicarboxamide (II),<br>
starting from S-( -)-5-[[2-(acetyloxy)-l-oxopropyl]-amino ]-2,4,6-triiodo- 1,3-<br>
benzenedicarboxylic acid dichloride (III) and 2-amino-l ,3-propanediol, in a<br>
solvent selected from the group consisting of C2-C5 alcohols, monoalkyl ether<br>
glycols, and cyclic, straight or branched alkyl ethers,<br>
b)	hydrolysis of the acetyl group of compound (II) by water addition keeping<br>
the solution temperature in the range 50-70°C for a time of 4-8h, characterized in<br>
that the molar ratio of 2-amino-l ,3-propanediol to S-(-)-5-[[2-(acetyloxy)-l-<br>
oxopropyl]amino]-. 2,4,6-triiodo-1 ,3-benzendicarboxylic acid dichloride ranges<br>
from 6 to 25 and in that no further base is added to the reaction mixture.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1, in which the minimum molar ratio of 2-amino-1 ,3-propanediol to S-(- )-5-[[2-(acetyloxy)-l-oxopropyl]amino]-2,4,6-triiodo-1 ,3-benzendicarboxylic acid dichloride ranges from 8 to 15.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claims 1-2  in which the solvent is a straight or branched C2-C5 alcohol.<br><br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 3, in which the solvent is selected from the group consisting of C2-C5 secondary alcohols.<br>
5.	The process as claimed in claim 2, in which the solvent is selected from the group consisting of isopropanol, sec- butanol and t-butanol.<br>
6.	The process as claimed in claims 1-2, in which the solvent is a C3-C7 glycol monoalkyl ether.<br>
7.	The process as claimed in claim 6, in which the solvent is selected from 2-methoxyethanol and 2-ethoxyethanol.<br>
8.	The process claimed in claims 1-2, in which the solvent is a cyclic straight or branched C4-C10 alkyl ether.<br>
9.	The process claimed in claims 1-2, in which the solvent is selected from dioxane, diglyme or methyl tert-butyl ether.<br>
10.	The process claimed in claims 1-9, in which the reaction temperature for the preparation of compound (II) ranges from 48 to 85°C and the reaction time ranges from 2 to 6 hours.<br>
11.	The process claimed in claims 1-10, in which at the end of the reaction between serinol and compound III (step a) the solvent is distilled off to dryness under pressure further comprising neutralisation of the solution obtained from (b) by addition of HCL and following concentration and purification by elution on a macroporous highly cross-linked styrene resin and subsequently on a strong cationic resin of the sulfonic type, regenerated in the acidic form, and on a mean anionic resin of the secondary amine type, regenerated in the OH- form.<br><br>
12.    The process according to claims 1-11, in which the hydrolysis of step (b) is carried out at a temperature from 55 to 65 °C for a time of 5 to 7h.</td>
