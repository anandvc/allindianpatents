PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a fuel filler neck assembly with an anti theft device used to prevent theft of liquids and other flowable fluids and more particularly this relates to anti theft device, which prevents the tampering, or theft of fuel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Conventionally fuel-filling neck is provided to facilitate the transfer of the fluid from the dispenser to fuel tank. The filler neck extends into the interior of the fuel tank. In order to fill the fuel tank one must remove the fuel cap from the filler neck to expose an upper end. The fuel cap closes the filler tube at times other than when fuel is being admitted to the fuel tank.<br>
The fuel cap is used to cover the open upper end of the filler neck and also prevents the flow of fuel out the tank in case of accident. The cap also helps to reduce the chances of fuel leaks and their associated dangers and substantially prevents the leakages of fuel vapors from the filler neck, which is a major source of hydrocarbon emission.<br>
Fuel tank caps are available with or without locking system. Unfortunately even lockable fuel caps may be breached or compromised permitting fuel theft by siphoning, pumping or the like. In some instances, the theft is only an inconvenience, however in other, such as where hydrocarbon fuel added to power implement or automotive vehicles, the theft of fuel has become a great concern with the rising cost of the fuel causing financial loss to user. During the process, the spill results in environmental contamination and is also a source of tremendous waste of natural resources.<br>
2<br><br>
Accordingly there has been a need for a novel improvement in filler neck, which is of simple construction, inexpensive to manufacture and effective to prevent tampering or theft of the fuel from fuel tank. The present invention fulfills these needs. The transfer of fluids or flowable materials is not restricted to any areas, such as automotive equipment. Theft of hazardous material such as chemicals, caustic fluids, hot liquids and the like are transferred, utilizing siphon tubes and similar devices. Spills of such material could be hazardous or dangerous to individuals. It is therefore important to provide a means which will insure that unauthorized transfer of liquids is prevented, thereby not only reducing theft of the costly material being transferred but also preventing possible damage to the environment and/or injury to individuals.<br>
Fig 1 shows conventional fuel filling neck with external locking arrangement. The neck (A) and tank body (B) are welded together on periphery. Fuel cap (D) is hinged to the said neck at one end and other end is provided with a locking arrangement to lock to said neck at other end through its locking means (C). Fuel cap (D) consists of sealing ring (E) and a spring-loaded closer member (F). After closer of cap (D) sealing ring (E) rests on surface (H) of said neck and closer member (F) rests on sealing race (G) and prevents fuel spillage from tank.<br>
Fig. 2 shows another conventional fuel filling neck arrangement with integral locking means usually fixed within the fuel cap. It consists of a filling tube commonly known as filler neck in cylindrical shape. The neck (A) and tank body (B) are welded together on periphery. Fuel cap (D) consists of sealing ring (E) and a spring-loaded closer member (F). After closer of cap (D) sealing ring (E) rests on surface (H) of said neck and closer member (F) rests on sealing race (G) and prevents fuel spillage from tank. Fuel tank cap (D) is locked to the neck by its integral locking arrangement (I).<br>
The drawback associated with said conventional type of fuel filling necks are that these are not fool proof to prevent theft of fuel as locked fuel caps may be breached or compromised easily and permitting fuel theft by siphoning, pumping or the like.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring to fig 3 the brackets (5) are preferably "L" shaped with a slight inward taper at the top end of the vertical member (5a) of the "L" shaped brackets. The brackets (5) are provided with a hole (6) in the horizontal member (5b) . At the vertical member end, nuts (3) are welded. Similarly bracket (1) is preferably "L" shaped with a slight inward taper at the top end of the vertical member (la) of the "L" shaped bracket. Screws and nuts (2, 3, 4 and 11) are provided at both the horizontal member (lb) and the vertical member (la) of the "L" shaped bracket (1). The assembly of these brackets is done by inserting the screw (2) through the holes (6) of brackets (5). The assembly can also be done in the filler neck during retrofit.<br>
Referring to fig 4, a perforated mesh (7) is rolled in cylindrical shape. One end of said mesh (7) is closed by a washer (8) having a hole. The diameter of the mesh cylinder is substantially equal to the inner diameter of the sealing race (G) in the filler neck. Referring to fig (5) the closed end of the cylindrical mesh (7) is placed over the screw (2) while assembling in the filler tube.<br>
Figure 6 shows the assembly of the ami theft device in the filler neck. Holes and depressions (J) are made to accommodate the counter sunk screws (4) which are fixed from outside of the filler neck and their heads may be damaged so that they cannot be removed once assembled. A nut (11) is tightened on screw (2) to fix the cylindrical<br>
mesh.<br>
7<br><br>
In an alternate embodiment illustrated in figure 7, the cylindrical mesh (7) is integrally provided in the said neck, thereby eliminating the requirement of mounting brackets (5,1).<br>
Referring to fig (8) Fixed louvers (10) are provided in a cylindrical mesh (9). Said louvers assist to provide additional measure to prevent tampering or theft of fuel.<br>
During fitment the holes on the filler tube are drilled at suitable location. Then a depression (J) at the drilled hole is made to accommodate the screw head (4). First the bracket (1) is inserted in the filler neck and loosely fixed by screw (4). Then two bracket (5) are inserted such a way that the screw (2) of bracket (1) passes through hole (6). These brackets (5) are also loosely fixed to the filler tube by screws (4). After this assembly the cylindrical mesh (6) is pressed to fix over the screw (2). The upper end of the Mesh (7) is tightly fixed in sealing race (G). After this assembly all the screws are fully tightened to fix the Anti theft device in its position then the screw heads are flattened such that they become damages to avoid unauthorized screw loosening.<br>
Said antitheft device can be easily retrofitted on existing vehicle fuel filler necks. For new fuel tanks even we can integrate the said mesh with the body of fuel filler neck and there is no need for the mounting brackets in that case. Thereby the requirement of various mounting brackets can be avoided.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that those skilled in the art may practice numerous alterations and modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof<br>
