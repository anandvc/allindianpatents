				<td>A METHOD AND SEMIFINISHED PRODUCT<br>
FOR PRODUCING A CHIP CARD<br>
This invention relates to a method and semifinished product for producing a<br>
ship card having a coil and/or contact areas for contactless and/or contact-type data<br>
exchange with external devices.<br>
German laid-open print DE 44 16 697 A1 discloses a data carrier and a<br>
method for producing a data carrier wherein a coil is disposed within a single- or<br>
multilayer card structure for the purposes of energy supply and/or data exchange of<br>
the integrated circuit with external devices. The module comprising the integrated<br>
circuit has two contact elements that serve to connect with the contact areas of the<br>
coil. The coil is preferably a wire-wound coil, punched out of a metal foil or<br>
electroconductive plastic foil or consists of an etched copper coil and is applied to an<br>
insulating layer of the card body.<br>
The electric connection between the contact areas of the coil and the contact<br>
areas of the integrated circuit is produced, or improved, by the use of conductive<br>
adhesive or anisotropic conductive adhesive in known contacting methods.<br>
Alternatively, the contact areas of the coils and integrated circuit are soldered.<br>
Preferably, flip-chip methods are used for this purpose.<br>
Upon the use of printed coils, which advantageously also have printed coil<br>
terminal areas, it has turned out that the printed coils and terminal areas consisting of<br>
silver conductive paste do not enter into a reliable connection with anisotropic<br>
conductive adhesive, or the direct connection of dual interface modules with printed<br>
coils involves reliability problems during production and in operation. The problem<br>
therefore arises of specifying a chip card, a semifinished product and a method for<br>
producing the chip card or semifinished product that permit a reliable electric<br>
connection between coil and integrated circuit to be produced using a printed coil.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for producing chip cards<br>
for contactless and/or contact-type operation having a multilayer card body, an<br>
integrated circuit and at least one coil for data exchange and for power supply, the<br>
coil being aplied to one or more layers of the card body by printing technology,<br>
characterized in that after production of the printed coil a metal. foil is placed over the<br>
coil terminals and laminated into the card body, thereby producing the connection<br>
between the contact areas of the printed coil and the metal foil, and contact areas of<br>
the integrated circuit are connected electroconductively with the coil terminals via the<br>
meta toil.<br>
he pressnt invention also provides a semifinished product for producing<br>
contactiessly operated chip cards having a multilayer card body, an integrated circuit<br>
and at least one coil for data exchange and for power supply, the coil being applied to<br>
one ot more layers of the card body by printing technology, characterized in that a<br>
printed coil having coil terminal areas that are likewise printed are disposed on a core<br>
foil on one or both sides, a metal foil being disposed over the coil terminal areas for<br>
electroconductively connecting the coil terminals with terminal areas of an integrated<br>
circuit.<br>
The present invention further provides a contavtlessly operated chip card<br>
having a multilayer card body, an integrated circuit and at least one coil for data<br>
exchange and for power supply, the coil being applied to a layer of the card body by<br>
printing technology, characterized in that the printed coil is mounted on a core foil of<br>
the card body and has coil terminal areas that are covered by a metal foil which<br>
produces an electroconductive connection of the coil terminals with terminal areas of<br>
the integrated circuit.<br>
Preferably, the conductive adhesive is disposed on the coil contact areas or<br>
the metal foil in the region of the coil contact areas. For incorporating a module<br>
containing the integrated circuit, preferably a gap in the card body is produced that is<br><br>
dimensioned so that the metal foil is exposed at least in the connecting region to the<br>
contact areas of the integrated circuit. The gap for the module is preferably milled, the<br>
metal foil being exposed or milled at least in the connecting region to the contact<br>
areas of the integrated circuit. An anisotropic conductive adhesive is preferably<br>
disposed between the metal foil and the terminal areas of the integrated circuit. The<br>
metal foil is preferably connected with the coil terminal areas by conductive adhesive.<br><br>
According to the invention, it is provided that after production of the printed coil<br>
on a carrier element, which can be for example a core foil, within the structure of a<br>
laminated card, a metal foil is disposed that at least partly covers the coil terminal<br>
areas, a part of the metal foil coming to lie opposite the contact areas of the module to<br>
be later incorporated. The layer provided with the printed coil and metal foil is<br>
laminated into the card body. The laminating process presses the metal foil and the<br>
contact areas of the printed coil together, thereby producing an electric connection<br>
between printed coil and metal foil.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided that<br>
conductive adhesive is disposed either on the coil contact areas or on the metal foil in<br>
the region of the coil contact areas or over the whole area. The arrangement of the<br>
conductive adhesive increases the reliability of the electric connection between the coil<br>
and the metal foil.<br>
In particular in case the module is incorporated in the card body subsequently, it<br>
is provided that a gap is produced in the card body for incorporating the module, said<br>
gap being dimensioned so that the metal foil is exposed in the connecting region to the<br>
contacl areas of the integrated circuit. Upon insertion of the module a terminal area for<br>
the coil opposite the contact areas is thus produced.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the gap for the<br>
module is milled. In this case it has proved favorable to slightly mill the metal foil in<br>
the connecting region to the contact areas of the integrated circuit. In this way a more<br>
reliable electric connection to the contact areas of the integrated circuit is obtained<br>
upon incorporation of the module.<br>
The electric connection between the metal foil and the terminal areas of the<br>
integrated circuit can moreover be improved if an anisotropic conductive adhesive is<br>
incorporated between the two terminal areas. In this case the anisotropic conductive<br>
adhesive is advantageously already applied to the terminal areas of the integrated<br>
circuit. Upon lamination of the module into the card body the anisotropic conductive<br>
adhesive produces the electric connection with the metal foil.<br><br>
The inventive method permits printed coils to be used in contactless cards or dual<br>
interface cards, whereby the reliability of the connection between integrated circuit<br>
and printed coil can be increased so that it is comparable to the connection reliability<br>
upon the use of etched copper coils for example.<br>
The invention relates not only to the method for producing chip cards with<br>
contactless and/or contact-type operation but also to a semifinished product to be used<br>
for producing said chip cards. Said semifinished product consists of a carrier layer on<br>
which a printed coil having coil terminal areas at the coil ends is disposed. Over each<br>
of said coil terminal areas a metal foil is disposed that at least partly cover them and<br>
protrude further into the region where the integrated circuit or module is later to be<br>
incorporated.<br>
Preferably, conductive adhesive is applied to the metal foil or the coil contact<br>
areas in the contacting region to produce a reliable connection between the metal foil<br>
and the coil contact areas. This is advantageous in particular when the semifinished<br>
product i.e. the carrier foil with the printed coil and the metal foil, is processed only<br>
later.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to a contactlessly operated chip card or a dual<br>
interface card wherein an inside layer of the card body has disposed thereon a printed<br>
coil whose terminal areas are covered with a metal foil that is disposed so as to be<br>
connected with the contact areas of the integrated circuit.<br>
Advantageously, an anisotropic conductive adhesive is disposed between the<br>
metal foil and the contact areas of the integrated circuit. This has the advantage of<br>
increasing the connection reliability and the durability of the connection.<br>
Hereinafter the invention will be explained in more detail with reference to Figs.<br>
1 to 4, in which:<br>
Fig,. 1 shows the front of a dual interface card,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the back of a dual interface card,<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows the layer structure of a dual interface card according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross section of the card according to Figs. 1, 2 and 3.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the front of chip card 1. It is assumed here that the cover layers are<br>
made of transparent material so that the inventive elements are recognizable.<br>
Coil 2 with terminal areas 31 and 32 is disposed in core layer 11 of card body 1.<br>
First coil terminal area 31 is for throughplating to coil terminal area 31' of coil 21<br>
located on the back of core foil 11. Fig. 1 shows further terminal area 33 that is<br>
likewise throughplated to coil 21 on the back of the carrier element. Coil contact areas<br>
32 and 33 serve to contact the coil with the terminal areas of the integrated circuit<br>
contained in module 5. This connection is effected not directly but via metal foils 4 or<br>
41 partly covering terminal areas 32 and 33, respectively, and leading to the terminal<br>
areas of the integrated circuit in module 5.<br>
Metal foils 4 and 41 are preferably made of copper, silver or silver-plated copper<br>
to guarantee good conductivity and reliable connection.<br>
Fi:g. 2 shows the underside of card 1. This side bears the second part of coil 21<br>
with terminal areas 31' and 33', said terminal areas each being throughplated to<br>
terminal areas 31 and 33 on the front. Terminal area 33 located on the front is shown<br>
by dotted lines in Fig. 2. As can be seen from Fig. 2, metal foils 4, 41 (Fig. 2 showing<br>
backs 4' and 41') lead to the terminal areas of the integrated circuit, which are not<br>
explicitly shown in the Figure.<br>
Fig 3 shows a multilayer card structure in cross section. Said card structure<br>
consists of carrier foil 11 bearing coil 2 and 2' (not shown in Fig. 3) with coil terminal<br>
areas 31, 32, 33 and 31', 33'. Disposed over coil terminal areas 32 and 33 is metal foil<br>
4, 4' which is advantageously connected with coil terminal areas 32 with an<br>
electroconductive adhesive.<br>
In the region of the terminal areas of the integrated circuit, anisotropic<br>
conductive adhesive 6 is disposed in Fig. 3 for the purpose of connecting with module<br><br>
5, i.e. terminal areas 7 of module 5. A conductive adhesive can likewise be disposed<br>
between metal foil 4 and coil terminal areas 32, 33.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross section of a card suitable for contactless and contact-type<br>
data exchange. Module 5 contains an integrated circuit which is not shown in the<br>
Figure. The integrated circuit can communicate with the outside world through contact<br>
areas 51 by contact-type data exchange. Contactless data exchange is effected using<br>
coil 2, 21, of which only terminal areas 32 and 33 are shown in the Figure. Contacting<br>
of coil 2, 21 with terminal areas 7 of the integrated circuit is effected through metal<br>
foils 4, 41 applied to coil terminal areas 32 and 33. For contacting it is preferable to<br>
use amisotropic conductive adhesive 6 that is either applied to foil 4, 41 before<br>
insertion of module 5, as shown in the Figure, or already disposed on contact areas 7<br>
of the integrated circuit.<br><br>
