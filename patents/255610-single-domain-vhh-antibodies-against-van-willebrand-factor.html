(B)	A Company incorporated under the laws of BELGIUM<br>
(C)	Technologiepark 4,<br>
B-9052 Zwijnaarde,<br>
            Belgium.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to improved Nanobodies™ against von Willebrand Factor (vWF), as well as to polypeptides comprising or essentially consisting of one or more of such Nanobodies. [Note: Nanobody™, Nanobodies™ and Nanoclone™ are trademarks of Ablynx N. V]<br>
The invention also relates to nucleic acids encoding such Nanobodies and polypeptides; to methods for preparing such Nanobodies and polypeptides; to host cells expressing or capable of expressing such Nanobodies or polypeptides; to compositions comprising such Nanobodies, polypeptides, nucleic acids or host cells; and to uses of such Nanobodies, such polypeptides, such nucleic acids, such host cells or such compositions, in particular for prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, such as the prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic purposes mentioned below.<br>
Other aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will become clear from the further description hereinbelow.<br>
WO 04/062551 of Applicant relates to Nanobodies against Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and to the preparation and use thereof, in particular for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases and disorders relating to platelet-mediated aggregation.<br>
The anti-vWF Nanobodies according to WO 04/062551 may be humanized and may be monovalent or multivalent, the latter of which leads to increased affinity for vWF. The anti-vWF Nanobodies according to WO 04/062551 may also be multispecific, and may in particular be in the form of a multispecific construct comprising two or more Nanobodies against vWF and a further Nanobody directed against a serum protein such as human serum albumin, which leads to an increased half-life in vivo.<br>
The anti-vWF Nanobodies described in WO 04/062551 may be directed against any epitope or conformation of vWF (such as the Al domain or A3 domain), but are preferably directed against the Al domain, and in particular against the activated conformation of the A1 domain.<br>
WO 04/062551 also describes the preparation of the anti-vWF Nanobodies, nucleotide sequences encoding the anti-vWF Nanobodies, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising the anti-vWF Nanobodies.<br><br><br>
The anti-vWF Nanobodies and compositions described in WO 04/062551 may be used for the prevention and treatment of diseases and disorders related to platelet-mediated aggregation, such as the formation of a non-occlusive thrombus, the formation of an occlusive thrombus, arterial thrombus formation, acute coronary occlusion, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, restenosis and disorders arising from coronary by-pass graft, coronary artery valve replacement and coronary interventions such angioplasty, stenting or atherectomy, hyperplasia after angioplasty, atherectomy or arterial stenting, occlusive syndrome in a vascular system or lack of patency of diseased arteries, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), transient cerebral ischemic attack, unstable or stable angina pectoris, cerebral infarction, HELLP syndrome, carotid endarterectomy, carotid artery stenosis, critical limb ischaemia, cardioembolism, peripheral vascular disease, restenosis and myocardial infarction..<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions described in WO 04/062551 may be suitable for intravenous, subcutaneous, oral, sublingual, topical, nasal, vaginal or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation; and may also comprise a trombolytic agent, such as staphylokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, single chain streptokinase, urokinase and acyl plasminogen streptokinase complex. The anti-vWF Nanobodies described in WO 04/062551 may also be used for diagnostic purposes (optionally in the form of a kit-of-parts) or in coatings for medical devices such as stents<br>
It is a general object of the present invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, in particular against human vWF.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, in particular against human vWF, and to provide proteins or polypeptides comprising the same, that are suitable for therapeutic and/or diagnostic use, and in particular for the prevention, treatment and/or diagnosis of one or more diseases and disorders associated with and/or mediated by vWF such as those mentioned above, and/or that can be used in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of one or more diseases associated with and/or mediated by vWF, such as those mentioned above.<br>
More in particular, it is an object of the invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, and to provide proteins and polypeptides comprising the same, that are either an<br><br><br>
alternative to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against vWF described in WO 04/062551 and/or that have one or more improved properties or characteristics, compared to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against vWF described in WO 04/062551.<br>
More in particular, it is an object of the invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, and to provide proteins or polypeptides comprising the same, that are improved compared to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against vWF described in WO 04/062551 with respect to one or more of the following properties or characteristics:<br>
increased affinity for vWF, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow); better suitability for formatting in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format);<br>
better suitability for formatting in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow); improved suitability or susceptibility for "humanizing" substitutions (as defined herein); and/or<br>
less immunogenicity, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow) in a monovalent format;<br>
increased stability, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow) in a monovalent format;<br>
increased specificity towards vWF, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow) in a monovalent format;<br>
decreased or where desired increased cross-reactivity with vWF from different species; and/or<br><br><br>
one or more other improved properties desirable for pharmaceutical use (including<br>
prophylactic use and/or therapeutic use) and/or for diagnostic use (including but not<br>
limited to use for imaging purposes), either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent<br>
format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for<br>
example  one  of the   multispecific   formats   described   in   WO   04/062551   or<br>
hereinbelow).<br>
These objects are achieved by the Nanobodies against vWF and by the polypeptides described herein. The Nanobodies against vWF and polypeptides described herein are in particular directed against human vWF, but it is included within the scope of the invention that some of the anti-vWF Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may show cross-reactivity with vWF from other vertebrate animals, in particular from other warm-blooded animals, more in particular from other mammals, and in particular from other species of primates, such as the baboons used in the Examples below. However, as with anti-vWF Nanobodies described in WO 04/062551, the present invention in its broadest sense is not particularly limited to or defined by a specific epitope, domain or confirmation of vWF against which the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention are directed. However, it is generally assumed and preferred that the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention are directed against the Al domain of vWF, either in its activated or non-activated confirmation.<br>

Most preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, all three CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I or from the group of CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, that have 3, 2 or only I amino acid difference(s) with at least one of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
Even more preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least one of the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I. Preferably, in this embodiment, at least one or preferably both of the other two CDR sequences present are suitably chosen from CDR sequences that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the corresponding CDR sequences, respectively, listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of the CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino<br><br><br>
acid difference(s) with at least one of the corresponding sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
In particular, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least the CDR3 sequence present is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDR3 listed in Table I. Preferably, in this embodiment, at least one and preferably both of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences present are suitably chosen from the groups of CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, listed in listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with at least one of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
Even more preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least two of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table 1. Preferably, in this embodiment, the remaining CDR sequence present are suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the corresponding CDR sequences listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with at least one of the corresponding sequences listed in Table I.<br>
In particular, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least the CDR3 sequence is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDR3 sequences listed in Table I, and either the CDRl sequence or the CDR2 sequence is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I. Preferably, in this embodiment, the remaining CDR sequence present are suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the corresponding CDR sequences listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with the corresponding CDR sequences listed in Table I.<br><br><br>
Even more preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, all three CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1, CDR2 and'CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
Also, generally, the combinations of CDR's listed in Table I (i.e. those mentioned on the same line in Table I) are preferred. Thus, it is generally preferred that, when a CDR in a Nanobody of the invention is a CDR sequence mentioned in Table I or is suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with a CDR sequence listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with a CDR sequence listed in Table I, that at least one and preferably both of the other CDR's are suitably chosen from the CDR sequences that belong to the same combination in Table I (i.e. mentioned on the same line in Table I) or are suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with the CDR sequence(s) belonging to the same combination and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only I amino acid difference(s) with the CDR sequence(s) belonging to the same combination. The other preferences indicated in the above paragraphs also apply to the combinations of CDR's mentioned in Table I.<br>
Thus, by means of non-limiting examples, a Nanobody of the invention can for example comprise a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table I, a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with one of the CDR2 sequences mentioned in Table I (but belonging to a different combination), and a CDR3 sequence.<br>
Some preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with one of the CDR2 sequences mentioned in Table I (but belonging to a different combination); and a CDR3 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDR3 sequences mentioned in Table I (but belonging to a different combination); or (2) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with<br><br><br>
one of the CDRl sequences mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence, and one of the CDR3 sequences listed in Table I; or (3) a CDRl sequence; a CDR2 sequence that has ' more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR2'sequence listed in Table I; and a CDR3 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid differences with the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination as the CDR2 sequence.<br>
Some particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDRl sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDRl sequences mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and a CDR3 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; (2) a CDRl sequence; a CDR 2 listed in Table I and a CDR3 sequence listed in Table I (in which the CDR2 sequence and CDR3 sequence may belong to different combinations).<br>
Some even more preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDRl sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDRl sequences mentioned in Table I; the CDR2 sequence listed in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and a CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table [ that belongs to a different combination; or (2) a CDRl sequence mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid differences with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and more than 80% sequence identity with the CDR3 sequence listed in Table I that belongs to same different combination.<br>
Particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise a CDRl sequence mentioned in Table I, a CDR2 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same.<br>

In one preferred, but non-limiting embodiments, the Nanobodies of the invention present in the polypeptides of the invention are chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO's: 60 to 73 and SEQ ID NO's: 86 to 97, and in particular from the "humanized"<br><br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The above and other aspects and embodiments of the invention will become clear from the further description hereinbelow, in which:<br>
a)	Unless indicated or defined otherwise, all terms used have their usual meaning in<br>
the art, which will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example made to the standard handbooks,  such  as  Sambrook et al,  "Molecular  Cloning: A  Laboratory<br><br><br>
Manual" ( 2nd.Ed.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989); F. Ausubel et al, eds., "Current protocols in molecular biology", Green Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York (1987); Roitt et' al., "Immunology" (6th. Ed.), Mosby/Elsevier, Edinburgh (2001); and Janeway et al., "Immunobiology" (6l Ed.), Garland Science Publishing/Churchill Livingstone, New York (2005), as well as to the general background art cited above;<br>
b)	Unless indicated otherwise, the term "immunoglobulin sequence" - whether it used herein to refer to a heavy chain antibody or to a conventional 4-chain antibody - is used as a general term to include both the full-size antibody, the individual chains thereof, as well as all parts, domains or fragments thereof (including but not limited to antigen-binding domains or fragments such as VHH domains or VH/VL domains, respectively). In addition, the term "sequence" as used herein (for example in terms like "immunoglobulin sequence", "antibody sequence", "variable domain sequence", "VHH sequence" or "protein sequence"), should generally be understood to include both the relevant amino acid sequence as well as nucleic acid sequences or nucleotide sequences encoding the same, unless the context requires a more limited interpretation;<br>
c)	Unless indicated otherwise, all methods, steps, techniques and manipulations that are not specifically described in detail can be performed and have been performed in a manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example again made to the standard handbooks, to the general background art referred to above and to the further references cited therein;<br>
d)	Amino acid residues will be indicated according to the standard three-letter or one-letter amino acid code, as mentioned in Table 1;<br><br><br>

	Glutamate	Glu	E<br>
Notes:(1)	Sometimes also considered to be a polar uncharged amino acid.(2)	Sometimes also considered to be a nonpolar uncharged amino acid.(3)	As will be clear to the skilled person, the fact that an amino acid residue is referred to inthis Table as being either charged or uncharged at pH 6,0 to 7,0 does not reflect in any wayon the charge said amino acid residue may have at a pH lower than 6,0 and/or at a pH higherthan 7,0; the amino acid residues mentioned in the Table can be either charged and/oruncharged at such a higher or lower pH, as will be clear to the skilled person.(4)	As is known in the art, the charge of a His residue is greatly dependant upon evensmall shifts in pH, but a His residu can generally be considered essentially uncharged at a pHof about 6,5.<br><br>
e) For the purposes of comparing two or more nucleotide sequences, the percentage of "sequence 'identity" between a first nucleotide sequence and a second nucleotide sequence may be calculated by dividing [the number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence that are identical to the nucleotides at the corresponding positions in the second nucleotide sequence] by [the total number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of a nucleotide in the second nucleotide sequence - compared to the first nucleotide sequence - is considered as a difference at a single nucleotide (position). Alternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two or more nucleotide sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm for sequence alignment such as NCBI Blast v2.0, using standard settings.<br>
Some other techniques, computer algorithms and settings for determining the degree of sequence identity are for example described in WO 04/037999, EP 0 967 284, EP 1 085 089, WO 00/55318, WO 00/78972, WO 98/49185 and GB 2 357 768-A.<br>
Usually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of "sequence identity" between two nucleotide sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the nucleotide sequence with the greatest number of nucleotides will be taken as the "first" nucleotide sequence, and the other nucleotide sequence will be taken as the "second" nucleotide sequence;<br>
f) For the purposes of comparing two or more amino acid sequences, the percentage of "sequence identity" between a first amino acid sequence and a second amino acid sequence may be calculated by dividing [the number of amino acid residues in the first amino acid sequence that are identical to the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions in the second amino acid sequence] by [the total number of nucleotides in the first amino acid sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of an amino acid residue in the second amino acid sequence -compared to the first amino acid sequence - is considered as a difference at a single amino acid residue (position), i.e. as an "amino acid difference" as defined herein.<br>
Alternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm, such as those mentioned above for<br><br><br>
determining the degree of sequence identity for nucleotide sequences, again using standard settings.<br>
Usually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of "sequence identity" between two amino acid sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the amino acid sequence with the greatest number of amino acid residues will be taken as the "first" amino acid sequence, and the other amino acid sequence will be taken as the "second" amino acid sequence.<br>
Also, in determining the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences, the skilled person may take into account so-called "conservative" amino acid substitutions, which can generally be described as amino acid substitutions in which an amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue of similar chemical structure and which has little or essentially no influence on the function, activity or other biological properties of the polypeptide. Such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art, for example from WO 04/037999, GB-A-2 357 768, WO 98/49185, WO 00/46383 and WO 01/09300; and (preferred) types and/or combinations of such substitutions may be selected on the basis of the pertinent teachings from WO 04/037999 as well as WO 98/49185 and from the further references cited therein.<br>
Such conservative substitutions preferably are substitutions in which one amino acid within the following groups (a) - (e) is substituted by another amino acid residue within the same group: (a) small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues: Ala, Ser, Thr, Pro and Gly; (b) polar, negatively charged residues and their (uncharged) amides: Asp, Asn, Glu and Gin; (c) polar, positively charged residues: His, Arg and Lys; (d) large aliphatic, nonpolar residues: Met, Leu, He, Val and Cys; and (e) aromatic residues: Phe, Tyr and Trp.<br>
Particularly preferred conservative substitutions are as follows: Ala into Gly or into Ser; Arg into Lys; Asn into Gin or into His; Asp into Glu; Cys into Ser; Gin .into Asn; Glu into Asp; Gly into Ala or into Pro; His into Asn or into Gin; He into Leu or into Val; Leu into He or into Val; Lys into Arg, into Gin or into Glu; Met into Leu, into Tyr or into lie; Phe into Met, into Leu or into Tyr; Ser into Thr; Thr into Ser; Trp into Tyr; Tyr into Trp; and/or Phe into Val, into He or into Leu.<br><br><br>
Any amino acid substitutions applied to the polypeptides described herein may also be based on the analysis of the frequencies of amino acid variations between homologous proteins of different species developed by Schulz et al., Principles of Protein Structure, Springer-Verlag, 1978, on the analyses of structure forming potentials developed by Chou and Fasman, Biochemistry 13: 211, 1974 and Adv. Enzymol., 47: 45-149, 1978, and on the analysis of hydrophobicity patterns in proteins developed by Eisenberg et al., Proc. Nad. Acad Sci. USA 81: 140-144, 1984; Kyte &amp; Doolittle; J Molec. Biol. 157: 105-132, 198 1, and Goldman et al, Ann. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 15: 321-353, 1986, all incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Information on the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of Nanobodies given in the description below and in the general background art cited above. Also, for this purpose, the crystal structure of a VHH domain from a llama is for example given by Desmyter et al., Nature Structural Biology, Vol. 3, 9, 803 (1996); Spinelli et al., Natural Structural Biology (1996); 3, 752-757; and Decanniere et al., Structure, Vol. 7, 4, 361 (1999);<br>
g) amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences are said to be "exactly the same'' if they have 100% sequence identity (as defined herein) over their entire length; h) when comparing two amino acid sequences, the term "amino acid difference" refers to an insertion, deletion or substitution of a single amino acid residue on a position of the first sequence, compared to the second sequence; it being understood that two amino acid sequences can contain one, two or more such amino acid differences; i) a nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered to be "(in) essentially isolated (form)" - for example, compared to its native biological source and/or the reaction medium or cultivation medium from which it has been obtained - when it has been separated from at least one other component with which it is usually associated in said source or medium, such as another nucleic acid, another protein/polypeptide, another biological component or macromolecule or at least one contaminant, impurity, or minor component. In particular, a nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered "essentially isolated" when it has been purified at least 2-fold, in particular at least 10-fold, more in particular at least 100-fold, and up to 1000-fold or more. A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence that is "in essentially isolated form" is preferably<br><br>

Other aspects, embodiments, advantages and applications of the invention will become clear from the further description hereinbelow.<br>
WO 04/062551 of Applicant relates to Nanobodies against Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and to the preparation and use thereof, in particular for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases and disorders relating to platelet-mediated aggregation.<br>
The anti-vWF Nanobodies according to WO 04/062551 may be humanized and may be monovalent or multivalent, the latter of which leads to increased affinity for vWF. The anti-vWF Nanobodies according to WO 04/062551 may also be multispecific, and may in particular be in the form of a multispecific construct comprising two or more Nanobodies against vWF and a further Nanobody directed against a serum protein such as human serum albumin, which leads to an increased half-life in vivo.<br>
The anti-vWF Nanobodies described in WO 04/062551 may be directed against any epitope or conformation of vWF (such as the Al domain or A3 domain), but are preferably directed against the Al domain, and in particular against the activated conformation of the A1 domain.<br>
WO 04/062551 also describes the preparation of the anti-vWF Nanobodies, nucleotide sequences encoding the anti-vWF Nanobodies, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising the anti-vWF Nanobodies.<br><br><br>
The anti-vWF Nanobodies and compositions described in WO 04/062551 may be used for the prevention and treatment of diseases and disorders related to platelet-mediated aggregation, such as the formation of a non-occlusive thrombus, the formation of an occlusive thrombus, arterial thrombus formation, acute coronary occlusion, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, restenosis and disorders arising from coronary by-pass graft, coronary artery valve replacement and coronary interventions such angioplasty, stenting or atherectomy, hyperplasia after angioplasty, atherectomy or arterial stenting, occlusive syndrome in a vascular system or lack of patency of diseased arteries, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), transient cerebral ischemic attack, unstable or stable angina pectoris, cerebral infarction, HELLP syndrome, carotid endarterectomy, carotid artery stenosis, critical limb ischaemia, cardioembolism, peripheral vascular disease, restenosis and myocardial infarction..<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions described in WO 04/062551 may be suitable for intravenous, subcutaneous, oral, sublingual, topical, nasal, vaginal or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation; and may also comprise a trombolytic agent, such as staphylokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, single chain streptokinase, urokinase and acyl plasminogen streptokinase complex. The anti-vWF Nanobodies described in WO 04/062551 may also be used for diagnostic purposes (optionally in the form of a kit-of-parts) or in coatings for medical devices such as stents<br>
It is a general object of the present invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, in particular against human vWF.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, in particular against human vWF, and to provide proteins or polypeptides comprising the same, that are suitable for therapeutic and/or diagnostic use, and in particular for the prevention, treatment and/or diagnosis of one or more diseases and disorders associated with and/or mediated by vWF such as those mentioned above, and/or that can be used in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and/or treatment of one or more diseases associated with and/or mediated by vWF, such as those mentioned above.<br>
More in particular, it is an object of the invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, and to provide proteins and polypeptides comprising the same, that are either an<br><br><br>
alternative to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against vWF described in WO 04/062551 and/or that have one or more improved properties or characteristics, compared to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against vWF described in WO 04/062551.<br>
More in particular, it is an object of the invention to provide Nanobodies against vWF, and to provide proteins or polypeptides comprising the same, that are improved compared to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against vWF described in WO 04/062551 with respect to one or more of the following properties or characteristics:<br>
increased affinity for vWF, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow); better suitability for formatting in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format);<br>
better suitability for formatting in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow); improved suitability or susceptibility for "humanizing" substitutions (as defined herein); and/or<br>
less immunogenicity, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow) in a monovalent format;<br>
increased stability, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow) in a monovalent format;<br>
increased specificity towards vWF, either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for example one of the multispecific formats described in WO 04/062551 or hereinbelow) in a monovalent format;<br>
decreased or where desired increased cross-reactivity with vWF from different species; and/or<br><br><br>
one or more other improved properties desirable for pharmaceutical use (including<br>
prophylactic use and/or therapeutic use) and/or for diagnostic use (including but not<br>
limited to use for imaging purposes), either in a monovalent format, in a multivalent<br>
format (for example in a bivalent format) and/or in a multispecific format (for<br>
example  one  of the   multispecific   formats   described   in   WO   04/062551   or<br>
hereinbelow).<br>
These objects are achieved by the Nanobodies against vWF and by the polypeptides described herein. The Nanobodies against vWF and polypeptides described herein are in particular directed against human vWF, but it is included within the scope of the invention that some of the anti-vWF Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may show cross-reactivity with vWF from other vertebrate animals, in particular from other warm-blooded animals, more in particular from other mammals, and in particular from other species of primates, such as the baboons used in the Examples below. However, as with anti-vWF Nanobodies described in WO 04/062551, the present invention in its broadest sense is not particularly limited to or defined by a specific epitope, domain or confirmation of vWF against which the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention are directed. However, it is generally assumed and preferred that the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention are directed against the Al domain of vWF, either in its activated or non-activated confirmation.<br>

Most preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, all three CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I or from the group of CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, that have 3, 2 or only I amino acid difference(s) with at least one of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
Even more preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least one of the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I. Preferably, in this embodiment, at least one or preferably both of the other two CDR sequences present are suitably chosen from CDR sequences that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the corresponding CDR sequences, respectively, listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of the CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino<br><br><br>
acid difference(s) with at least one of the corresponding sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
In particular, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least the CDR3 sequence present is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDR3 listed in Table I. Preferably, in this embodiment, at least one and preferably both of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences present are suitably chosen from the groups of CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, listed in listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with at least one of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
Even more preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least two of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table 1. Preferably, in this embodiment, the remaining CDR sequence present are suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the corresponding CDR sequences listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with at least one of the corresponding sequences listed in Table I.<br>
In particular, in the Nanobodies of the invention, at least the CDR3 sequence is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDR3 sequences listed in Table I, and either the CDRl sequence or the CDR2 sequence is suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDRl and CDR2 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I. Preferably, in this embodiment, the remaining CDR sequence present are suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with at least one of the corresponding CDR sequences listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with the corresponding CDR sequences listed in Table I.<br><br><br>
Even more preferably, in the Nanobodies of the invention, all three CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1, CDR2 and'CDR3 sequences, respectively, listed in Table I.<br>
Also, generally, the combinations of CDR's listed in Table I (i.e. those mentioned on the same line in Table I) are preferred. Thus, it is generally preferred that, when a CDR in a Nanobody of the invention is a CDR sequence mentioned in Table I or is suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with a CDR sequence listed in Table I; and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only 1 amino acid difference(s) with a CDR sequence listed in Table I, that at least one and preferably both of the other CDR's are suitably chosen from the CDR sequences that belong to the same combination in Table I (i.e. mentioned on the same line in Table I) or are suitably chosen from the group of CDR sequences that have at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with the CDR sequence(s) belonging to the same combination and/or from the group consisting of CDR sequences that have 3, 2 or only I amino acid difference(s) with the CDR sequence(s) belonging to the same combination. The other preferences indicated in the above paragraphs also apply to the combinations of CDR's mentioned in Table I.<br>
Thus, by means of non-limiting examples, a Nanobody of the invention can for example comprise a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table I, a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with one of the CDR2 sequences mentioned in Table I (but belonging to a different combination), and a CDR3 sequence.<br>
Some preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDR1 sequences mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with one of the CDR2 sequences mentioned in Table I (but belonging to a different combination); and a CDR3 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDR3 sequences mentioned in Table I (but belonging to a different combination); or (2) a CDR1 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with<br><br><br>
one of the CDRl sequences mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence, and one of the CDR3 sequences listed in Table I; or (3) a CDRl sequence; a CDR2 sequence that has ' more than 80% sequence identity with one of the CDR2'sequence listed in Table I; and a CDR3 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid differences with the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination as the CDR2 sequence.<br>
Some particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDRl sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDRl sequences mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid difference with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and a CDR3 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; (2) a CDRl sequence; a CDR 2 listed in Table I and a CDR3 sequence listed in Table I (in which the CDR2 sequence and CDR3 sequence may belong to different combinations).<br>
Some even more preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise: (1) a CDRl sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with one of the CDRl sequences mentioned in Table I; the CDR2 sequence listed in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and a CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table [ that belongs to a different combination; or (2) a CDRl sequence mentioned in Table I; a CDR2 sequence that has 3, 2 or 1 amino acid differences with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and more than 80% sequence identity with the CDR3 sequence listed in Table I that belongs to same different combination.<br>
Particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention may for example comprise a CDRl sequence mentioned in Table I, a CDR2 sequence that has more than 80 % sequence identity with the CDR2 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same combination; and the CDR3 sequence mentioned in Table I that belongs to the same.<br>

In one preferred, but non-limiting embodiments, the Nanobodies of the invention present in the polypeptides of the invention are chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO's: 60 to 73 and SEQ ID NO's: 86 to 97, and in particular from the "humanized"<br><br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The above and other aspects and embodiments of the invention will become clear from the further description hereinbelow, in which:<br>
a)	Unless indicated or defined otherwise, all terms used have their usual meaning in<br>
the art, which will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example made to the standard handbooks,  such  as  Sambrook et al,  "Molecular  Cloning: A  Laboratory<br><br><br>
Manual" ( 2nd.Ed.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989); F. Ausubel et al, eds., "Current protocols in molecular biology", Green Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York (1987); Roitt et' al., "Immunology" (6th. Ed.), Mosby/Elsevier, Edinburgh (2001); and Janeway et al., "Immunobiology" (6l Ed.), Garland Science Publishing/Churchill Livingstone, New York (2005), as well as to the general background art cited above;<br>
b)	Unless indicated otherwise, the term "immunoglobulin sequence" - whether it used herein to refer to a heavy chain antibody or to a conventional 4-chain antibody - is used as a general term to include both the full-size antibody, the individual chains thereof, as well as all parts, domains or fragments thereof (including but not limited to antigen-binding domains or fragments such as VHH domains or VH/VL domains, respectively). In addition, the term "sequence" as used herein (for example in terms like "immunoglobulin sequence", "antibody sequence", "variable domain sequence", "VHH sequence" or "protein sequence"), should generally be understood to include both the relevant amino acid sequence as well as nucleic acid sequences or nucleotide sequences encoding the same, unless the context requires a more limited interpretation;<br>
c)	Unless indicated otherwise, all methods, steps, techniques and manipulations that are not specifically described in detail can be performed and have been performed in a manner known per se, as will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is for example again made to the standard handbooks, to the general background art referred to above and to the further references cited therein;<br>
d)	Amino acid residues will be indicated according to the standard three-letter or one-letter amino acid code, as mentioned in Table 1;<br><br><br>

	Glutamate	Glu	E<br>
Notes:(1)	Sometimes also considered to be a polar uncharged amino acid.(2)	Sometimes also considered to be a nonpolar uncharged amino acid.(3)	As will be clear to the skilled person, the fact that an amino acid residue is referred to inthis Table as being either charged or uncharged at pH 6,0 to 7,0 does not reflect in any wayon the charge said amino acid residue may have at a pH lower than 6,0 and/or at a pH higherthan 7,0; the amino acid residues mentioned in the Table can be either charged and/oruncharged at such a higher or lower pH, as will be clear to the skilled person.(4)	As is known in the art, the charge of a His residue is greatly dependant upon evensmall shifts in pH, but a His residu can generally be considered essentially uncharged at a pHof about 6,5.<br><br>
e) For the purposes of comparing two or more nucleotide sequences, the percentage of "sequence 'identity" between a first nucleotide sequence and a second nucleotide sequence may be calculated by dividing [the number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence that are identical to the nucleotides at the corresponding positions in the second nucleotide sequence] by [the total number of nucleotides in the first nucleotide sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of a nucleotide in the second nucleotide sequence - compared to the first nucleotide sequence - is considered as a difference at a single nucleotide (position). Alternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two or more nucleotide sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm for sequence alignment such as NCBI Blast v2.0, using standard settings.<br>
Some other techniques, computer algorithms and settings for determining the degree of sequence identity are for example described in WO 04/037999, EP 0 967 284, EP 1 085 089, WO 00/55318, WO 00/78972, WO 98/49185 and GB 2 357 768-A.<br>
Usually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of "sequence identity" between two nucleotide sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the nucleotide sequence with the greatest number of nucleotides will be taken as the "first" nucleotide sequence, and the other nucleotide sequence will be taken as the "second" nucleotide sequence;<br>
f) For the purposes of comparing two or more amino acid sequences, the percentage of "sequence identity" between a first amino acid sequence and a second amino acid sequence may be calculated by dividing [the number of amino acid residues in the first amino acid sequence that are identical to the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions in the second amino acid sequence] by [the total number of nucleotides in the first amino acid sequence] and multiplying by [100%], in which each deletion, insertion, substitution or addition of an amino acid residue in the second amino acid sequence -compared to the first amino acid sequence - is considered as a difference at a single amino acid residue (position), i.e. as an "amino acid difference" as defined herein.<br>
Alternatively, the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm, such as those mentioned above for<br><br><br>
determining the degree of sequence identity for nucleotide sequences, again using standard settings.<br>
Usually, for the purpose of determining the percentage of "sequence identity" between two amino acid sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove, the amino acid sequence with the greatest number of amino acid residues will be taken as the "first" amino acid sequence, and the other amino acid sequence will be taken as the "second" amino acid sequence.<br>
Also, in determining the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences, the skilled person may take into account so-called "conservative" amino acid substitutions, which can generally be described as amino acid substitutions in which an amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue of similar chemical structure and which has little or essentially no influence on the function, activity or other biological properties of the polypeptide. Such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art, for example from WO 04/037999, GB-A-2 357 768, WO 98/49185, WO 00/46383 and WO 01/09300; and (preferred) types and/or combinations of such substitutions may be selected on the basis of the pertinent teachings from WO 04/037999 as well as WO 98/49185 and from the further references cited therein.<br>
Such conservative substitutions preferably are substitutions in which one amino acid within the following groups (a) - (e) is substituted by another amino acid residue within the same group: (a) small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues: Ala, Ser, Thr, Pro and Gly; (b) polar, negatively charged residues and their (uncharged) amides: Asp, Asn, Glu and Gin; (c) polar, positively charged residues: His, Arg and Lys; (d) large aliphatic, nonpolar residues: Met, Leu, He, Val and Cys; and (e) aromatic residues: Phe, Tyr and Trp.<br>
Particularly preferred conservative substitutions are as follows: Ala into Gly or into Ser; Arg into Lys; Asn into Gin or into His; Asp into Glu; Cys into Ser; Gin .into Asn; Glu into Asp; Gly into Ala or into Pro; His into Asn or into Gin; He into Leu or into Val; Leu into He or into Val; Lys into Arg, into Gin or into Glu; Met into Leu, into Tyr or into lie; Phe into Met, into Leu or into Tyr; Ser into Thr; Thr into Ser; Trp into Tyr; Tyr into Trp; and/or Phe into Val, into He or into Leu.<br><br><br>
Any amino acid substitutions applied to the polypeptides described herein may also be based on the analysis of the frequencies of amino acid variations between homologous proteins of different species developed by Schulz et al., Principles of Protein Structure, Springer-Verlag, 1978, on the analyses of structure forming potentials developed by Chou and Fasman, Biochemistry 13: 211, 1974 and Adv. Enzymol., 47: 45-149, 1978, and on the analysis of hydrophobicity patterns in proteins developed by Eisenberg et al., Proc. Nad. Acad Sci. USA 81: 140-144, 1984; Kyte &amp; Doolittle; J Molec. Biol. 157: 105-132, 198 1, and Goldman et al, Ann. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 15: 321-353, 1986, all incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Information on the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of Nanobodies given in the description below and in the general background art cited above. Also, for this purpose, the crystal structure of a VHH domain from a llama is for example given by Desmyter et al., Nature Structural Biology, Vol. 3, 9, 803 (1996); Spinelli et al., Natural Structural Biology (1996); 3, 752-757; and Decanniere et al., Structure, Vol. 7, 4, 361 (1999);<br>
g) amino acid sequences and nucleic acid sequences are said to be "exactly the same'' if they have 100% sequence identity (as defined herein) over their entire length; h) when comparing two amino acid sequences, the term "amino acid difference" refers to an insertion, deletion or substitution of a single amino acid residue on a position of the first sequence, compared to the second sequence; it being understood that two amino acid sequences can contain one, two or more such amino acid differences; i) a nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered to be "(in) essentially isolated (form)" - for example, compared to its native biological source and/or the reaction medium or cultivation medium from which it has been obtained - when it has been separated from at least one other component with which it is usually associated in said source or medium, such as another nucleic acid, another protein/polypeptide, another biological component or macromolecule or at least one contaminant, impurity, or minor component. In particular, a nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence is considered "essentially isolated" when it has been purified at least 2-fold, in particular at least 10-fold, more in particular at least 100-fold, and up to 1000-fold or more. A nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence that is "in essentially isolated form" is preferably</td>
