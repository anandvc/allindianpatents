				<td>SNUBBER CAPACITOR RESETTING IN A DC-TO-DC CONVERTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The subject matter described herein generally relates to DC-to-DC<br>
converters, and more particularly relates to DC-to-DC converters with reduced<br>
voltage overshoot and reduced switching loss.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] A DC-to-DC converter receives one DC voltage as an input and<br>
generates another DC voltage as an output. Many DC-to-DC converters<br>
function by applying a DC voltage across an inductor or transformer for a<br>
short period of time, resulting in energy storage, followed by removal or<br>
switching out of the applied DC voltage, which causes the stored energy to be<br>
transferred to the output. The timing of the switching of the DC-to-DC<br>
converter is controlled to regulate the output voltage as necessary. When<br>
operating in a boost mode, the DC-to-DC converter generates an output<br>
voltage that is higher than the input voltage. When operating in the buck<br>
mode, the DC-to-DC converter generates an output voltage that is less than or<br>
equal to the input voltage.<br>
[0003] Although the prior art contains many different DC-to-DC converter<br>
configurations, the DC-to-DC converter disclosed in United States patent<br>
number 7,106,605 is representative. This particular DC-to-DC converter uses<br>
snubber capacitors across two of its output diodes. During operation of this<br>
DC-to-DC converter, the energy stored in these snubber capacitors may result<br>
in undesirable switching loss.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0004] An embodiment of a DC-to-DC converter includes a first low node<br>
and a second low node for a DC input voltage, a first high node and a second<br>
high node for a DC output voltage, a transformer having a primary winding<br>
and a secondary winding, a first switch coupled between a first end of the<br>
primary winding and the second low node, a second switch coupled between a<br>
second end of the primary winding and the second low node, a first switched<br>
diode element coupled between the first high node and a first end of the<br>
secondary winding, a second switched diode element coupled between the first<br>
high node and a second end of the secondary winding, a third switched diode<br>
element coupled between the first end of the secondary winding and the<br>
second high node, and a fourth switched diode element coupled between the<br>
second end of the secondary winding and the second high node. The DC-to-<br>
DC converter also includes a first capacitance element coupled between the<br>
first high node and the second end of the secondary winding, and a second<br>
capacitance element coupled between the second end of the secondary<br>
winding and the second high node. The DC-to-DC converter also includes a<br>
switch controller coupled to the first switch, the second switch, the first<br>
switched diode element, the second switched diode element, the third switched<br>
diode element, and the fourth switched diode element. The switch controller<br>
is configured to control discharging of the first capacitance element and the<br>
second capacitance element through the secondary winding during a buck<br>
mode of operation for the DC-to-DC converter.<br>
[0005] A method of controlling a DC-to-DC converter is also provided,<br>
where the DC-to-DC converter includes a first switch coupled between a first<br>
end of a primary transformer winding and a low node, a second switch<br>
coupled between a second end of the primary transformer winding and the low<br>
node, a first switched diode coupled between a first end of a secondary<br>
transformer winding and a first high node, a second switched diode coupled<br>
between a second end of the secondary transformer winding and the first high<br>
node, a third switched diode coupled between the first end of the secondary<br><br>
transformer winding and a second high node, a fourth switched diode coupled<br>
between the second end of the secondary transformer winding and the second<br>
high node, a first capacitance element in parallel with the second switched<br>
diode, and a second capacitance element in parallel with the fourth switched<br>
diode. The method involves detecting conditions corresponding to a light/no<br>
load buck mode of operation for the DC-to-DC converter, and in response to<br>
the detecting step, controlling the states of the first switch, the second switch,<br>
the first switched diode, the second switched diode, the third switched diode,<br>
and the fourth switched diode to facilitate discharging of the first capacitance<br>
element and the second capacitance element through the secondary winding.<br>
[0006] An embodiment of a method of controlling a DC-to-DC converter<br>
during a buck mode of operation is also provided. The DC-to-DC converter<br>
includes a first switch coupled between a first end of a primary transformer<br>
winding and a low node, a second switch coupled between a second end of the<br>
primary transformer winding and the low node, a first switched diode coupled<br>
between a first end of a secondary transformer winding and a first high node, a<br>
second switched diode coupled between a second end of the secondary<br>
transformer winding and the first high node, a third switched diode coupled<br>
between the first end of the secondary transformer winding and a second high<br>
node, a fourth switched diode coupled between the second end of the<br>
secondary transformer winding and the second high node, a first capacitance<br>
element in parallel with the second switched diode, and a second capacitance<br>
element in parallel with the fourth switched diode. The method involves: at<br>
the beginning of a first discharge period, closing the first switch to enable<br>
discharging of the first capacitance element and the second capacitance<br>
element through the secondary winding; during the first discharge period,<br>
maintaining the first switch in its closed state, maintaining the second switch<br>
in its closed state, maintaining the first switched diode in its shorted state,<br>
maintaining the second switched diode in its diode state, maintaining the third<br>
switched diode in its diode state, and maintaining the fourth switched diode in<br><br>
its diode state; and at the end of the first discharge period, switching the<br>
second switched diode to its shorted state.<br>
[0007] This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a<br>
simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description.<br>
This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of<br>
the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in<br>
determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] At least one embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter<br>
be described in conjunction with the following drawing figures, wherein like<br>
numerals denote like elements, and<br>
[0009] FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an embodiment of a DC-to-<br>
DC converter;<br>
[0010] FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram of an embodiment of a DC-to-DC<br>
converter; and<br>
[0011] FIG. 3 is a switch timing diagram corresponding to the DC-to-DC<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0012] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0013] Techniques and technologies may be described herein in terms of<br>
functional and/or logical block components and various processing steps. It<br>
should be appreciated that such block components may be realized by any<br>
number of hardware, software, and/or firmware components configured to<br>
perform the specified functions. For example, an embodiment of a system or a<br>
component may employ various integrated circuit components, e.g., memory<br><br>
elements, digital signal processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, or<br>
the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or<br>
more microprocessors or other control devices. In addition, those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate that embodiments may be practiced in conjunction with<br>
any number of data transmission protocols and that the system described<br>
herein is merely one suitable example.<br>
[0014] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to DC-to-<br>
DC conversion, transistor-based switches, diode bridges, switch controllers,<br>
and other functional aspects of the systems (and the individual operating<br>
components of the systems) may not be described in detail herein.<br>
Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures contained<br>
herein are intended to represent example functional relationships and/or<br>
physical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted that<br>
many alternative or additional functional relationships or physical connections<br>
may be present in an embodiment of the subject matter.<br>
[0015] As used herein, a "node" means any internal or external reference<br>
point, connection point, junction, signal line, conductive element, or the like,<br>
at which a given signal, logic level, voltage, data pattern, current, or quantity<br>
is present. Furthermore, two or more nodes may be realized by one physical<br>
element (and two or more signals can be multiplexed, modulated, or otherwise<br>
distinguished even though received or output at a common mode).<br>
[0016] The following description may refer to elements or nodes or<br>
features being "connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless<br>
expressly stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature<br>
is directly joined to (or directly communicates with) another<br>
element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless<br>
expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means that one element/node/feature is<br>
directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or indirectly communicates with)<br>
another element/node/feature, and not necessarily mechanically. Thus,<br>
although the schematic shown in FIG. 2 depicts one possible arrangement of<br><br>
elements, additional intervening elements, devices, features, or components<br>
may be present in an embodiment of the depicted subject matter.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an embodiment of a DC-to-<br>
DC converter 100. DC-to-DC converter 100 generally includes a transformer<br>
and switching circuit 102 and a switch controller 104 coupled to transformer<br>
and switching circuit 102. Transformer and switching circuit 102 is suitably<br>
configured to receive a DC voltage (VLo) and generate a DC voltage (VHi) in<br>
response to VLo- DC-to-DC converter 100 can operate in a bidirectional<br>
manner to convert a relatively low voltage to a relatively high voltage (boost<br>
mode) or to convert a relatively high voltage to a relatively low voltage (buck<br>
mode).<br>
[0018] In a typical application suitable for use with an electric or hybrid<br>
electric vehicle, VLO is approximately 10-12 volts, and VHI is approximately<br>
250-350 volts (for the boost mode of operation). As described in more detail<br>
below with reference to FIG. 2, transformer and switching circuit 102 includes<br>
various electrical components that are arranged in an appropriate topology and<br>
configuration. Such electrical components may include, without limitation:<br>
inductance elements; transistor-based switches; a transformer; capacitance<br>
elements; and conductive traces, interconnects, and/or nodes. Transformer<br>
and switching circuit 102 receives a number of switch control signals from<br>
switch controller 104. For consistency with FIG. 2, these switch control<br>
signals are labeled Q1, Q2, S1, S2, S3, and S4, and each switch control signal<br>
controls the state of its respective switch component. For this embodiment,<br>
the control signals Q1 and Q2 correspond to a first input switch and a second<br>
input switch of transformer and switching circuit 102. A relatively high level<br>
for Q1 or Q2 causes the respective switch to close (i.e., short), while a<br>
relatively low level for Q1 or Q2 causes the respective switch to open. For this<br>
embodiment, the control signals S1, S2, S3, and S4 correspond to four switched<br>
diode elements of transformer and switching circuit 102. A relatively high<br>
level for S1, S2, S3, or S4 causes the respective switched diode element to<br><br>
function as a short, while a relatively low level for S1, S2, S3, or S4 causes the<br>
respective switched diode element to function as a diode.<br>
[0019] Switch controller 104 is suitably configured to generate the switch<br>
control signals Q1, Q2, S1, S2, S3, and S4 during operation of DC-to-DC<br>
converter 100. Switch controller 104 may be implemented or performed with<br>
a general purpose processor, a content addressable memory, a digital signal<br>
processor, an application specific integrated circuit, a field programmable gate<br>
array, any suitable programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor<br>
logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof, designed to<br>
perform the functions described herein. A processor may be realized as a<br>
microprocessor, a controller, a microcontroller, or a state machine. A<br>
processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices,<br>
e.g., a combination of a digital signal processor and a microprocessor, a<br>
plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with<br>
a digital signal processor core, or any other such configuration.<br>
[0020] In practice, switch controller 104 monitors output conditions<br>
(represented by the feedback path 106 in FIG. 1) to determine the switching<br>
timing and switching patterns for transformer and switching circuit 102. In<br>
this regard, switch controller 104 can monitor the relatively high VHI voltage<br>
itself and/or the associated current to detect the desired operating mode for<br>
DC-to-DC converter 100. For this embodiment, switch controller 104 can<br>
detect conditions corresponding to (or indicative of) a boost mode of operation<br>
or a buck mode of operation. Moreover, switch controller 104 is suitably<br>
configured to detect a light load or no load condition, i.e., where little or no<br>
current is being consumed by the load associated with VH|. In particular,<br>
switch controller 104 can detect conditions corresponding to a light/no load<br>
buck mode of operation for DC-to-DC converter 100. In response to the<br>
detection of such a light/no load buck mode of operation, switch controller<br>
104 controls transformer and switching circuit 102 such that it functions in a<br>
buck mode, while also controlling discharging of snubber capacitance<br>
elements to reduce voltage overshooting and switching loss.<br><br>
[0021] FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram of an embodiment of a DC-to-DC<br>
converter 200 (for simplicity, the associated switch controller is not shown in<br>
FIG. 2). The circuit depicted in FIG. 2 may be used in the context of DC-to-<br>
DC converter 100 (FIG. 1). This embodiment of DC-to-DC converter 200<br>
includes, without limitation: a first low node 202; a second low node 204: a<br>
first high node 206; a second high node 208; a first inductance element<br>
(labeled LI); a second inductance element (labeled L2); a first switch 210: a<br>
second switch 212; a transformer 214; a first switched diode element 216; a<br>
second switched diode element 218; a third switched diode element 220; a<br>
fourth switched diode element 222; a first capacitance element (labeled CI);<br>
and a second capacitance element (labeled C2). Transformer 214 includes a<br>
primary winding 224 and a cooperating secondary winding 226. In FIG. 2, the<br>
components on the side of primary winding 224 may be considered to be an<br>
input (or output) circuit of DC-to-DC converter 200, and the components on<br>
the side of secondary winding 226 may be considered to be an output (or<br>
input) circuit of DC-to-DC converter 200.<br>
[0022] The relatively low DC voltage (VLO) is defined across first low<br>
node 202 and second low node 204, and the relatively high DC voltage (VHI)<br>
is defined across first high node 206 and second high node 208. As mentioned<br>
above, VHI is generated by DC-to-DC converter 200 in response to VLO.<br>
Inductance element LI is coupled between first low node 202 and a node 228<br>
that corresponds to a first end of primary winding 224. For the illustrated<br>
embodiment, inductance element LI is directly connected between first low<br>
node 202 and node 228. Inductance element L2 is coupled between first low<br>
node 202 and a node 230 that corresponds to a second end of primary winding<br>
224. For the illustrated embodiment, inductance element L2 is directly<br>
connected between first low node 202 and node 230. The amount of<br>
inductance provided by inductance elements LI and L2 will vary from one<br>
implementation to another. For a typical deployment in an electric or hybrid<br>
electric traction system, each of the inductance elements LI and L2 has an<br>
inductance within the range of about 5.0 μH.<br><br>
[0023] First switch 210 is coupled between node 228 and second low node<br>
204, and second switch 212 is coupled between node 230 and second low node<br>
204. For the illustrated embodiment, first switch 210 is directly connected<br>
between node 228 and second low node 204, and second switch 212 is directly<br>
connected between node 230 and second low node 204. Although FIG. 2<br>
depicts first switch 210 and second switch 212 as N-type MOSFET devices,<br>
an implementation of DC-to-DC converter 200 may use other transistor-based<br>
switches in this context.<br>
[0024) The transistor gate of first switch 210 receives the switch control<br>
signal Q1, and the transistor gate of second switch 212 receives the switch<br>
control signal Q2 (see FIG. 1). For this particular embodiment, a relatively<br>
high level for switch control signal Q1 causes first switch 210 to close,<br>
effectively shorting node 228 and second low node 204 together, while a<br>
relatively low level for switch control signal O1 causes first switch 210 to<br>
open, effectively creating an open circuit between node 228 and second low<br>
node 204. Second switch 212 is similarly controlled by switch control signal<br>
Q2.<br>
[0025] First switched diode element 216 is coupled between first high<br>
node 206 and a node 232 that corresponds to a first end of secondary winding<br>
226. For the illustrated embodiment, first switched diode element 216 is<br>
directly connected between first high node 206 and node 232. FIG. 2 depicts a<br>
leakage inductance (labeled L3) that represents the leakage inductance of<br>
secondary winding 226. For purposes of this description, leakage inductance<br>
L3 is considered to be an integral characteristic of secondary winding 226.<br>
This leakage inductance is relatively small compared to the inductance of<br>
inductance elements LI and L2.<br>
[0026] For this particular embodiment, first switched diode element 216<br>
(and the other switched diode elements in DC-to-DC converter 200) includes a<br>
switch in parallel with a diode. The switch may be realized as a transistor-<br>
based switch, e.g., an NPN bipolar junction transistor (BJT) as shown in FIG.<br>
2. Of course, an implementation of DC-to-DC converter 200 may use other<br><br>
transistor-based switches in this context. Here, the cathode of the diode is<br>
coupled to the collector of the BJT, and the anode of the diode is coupled to<br>
the emitter of the BJT. The base of the BJT of first switched diode element<br>
216 receives the switch control signal S1 (see FIG. 1). For this particular<br>
embodiment, a relatively high level for switch control signal S1 causes the BJT<br>
switch to close, effectively shorting first high node 206 and node 232 together,<br>
while a relatively low level for switch control signal S1 causes the BJT switch<br>
to open, effectively inserting the diode between first high node 206 and node<br>
232 to prevent current flow across the diode from first high node 206 to node<br>
232. Thus, depending upon the state of the switch control signal S1, first<br>
switched diode element 216 will function as a diode or a short.<br>
[0027] Second switched diode element 218 is coupled between first high<br>
node 206 and a node 234 that corresponds to a second end of secondary<br>
winding 226. For the illustrated embodiment, second switched diode element<br>
218 is directly connected between first high node 206 and node 234. For this<br>
particular embodiment, second switched diode element 218 includes a switch<br>
in parallel with a diode. The switch may be realized as a transistor-based<br>
switch, e.g., a BJT as shown in FIG. 2. Of course, an implementation of DC-<br>
to-DC converter 200 may use other transistor-based switches in this context.<br>
Here, the cathode of the diode is coupled to the collector of the BJT, and the<br>
anode of the diode is coupled to the emitter of the BJT. The base of the BJT<br>
of second switched diode element 218 receives the switch control signal S2<br>
(see FIG. 1). For this particular embodiment, a relatively high level for switch<br>
control signal S2 causes the BJT switch to close, effectively shorting first high<br>
node 206 and node 234 together, while a relatively low level for switch control<br>
signal S2 causes the BJT switch to open, effectively inserting the diode<br>
between first high node 206 and node 234 to prevent current flow across the<br>
diode from first high node 206 to node 234. Thus, depending upon the state of<br>
the switch control signal S2, second switched diode element 218 will function<br>
as a diode or a short.<br><br>
[0028] Third switched diode element 220 is coupled between node 232<br>
and second high node 208. For the illustrated embodiment, third switched<br>
diode element 220 is directly connected between node 232 and second high<br>
node 208. For this particular embodiment, third switched diode element 220<br>
includes a switch in parallel with a diode. The switch may be realized as a<br>
transistor-based switch, e.g., a BJT as shown in FIG. 2. Of course, an<br>
implementation of DC-to-DC converter 200 may use other transistor-based<br>
switches in this context. Here, the cathode of the diode is coupled to the<br>
collector of the BJT, and the anode of the diode is coupled to the emitter of the<br>
BJT. The base of the BJT of third switched diode element 220 receives the<br>
switch control signal S3 (see FIG. 1). For this particular embodiment, a<br>
relatively high level for switch control signal S3 causes the BJT switch to<br>
close, effectively shorting node 232 and second high node 208 together, while<br>
a relatively low level for switch control signal S3 causes the BJT switch to<br>
open, effectively inserting the diode between node 232 and second high node<br>
208 to prevent current flow across the diode from node 232 to second high<br>
node 208. Thus, depending upon the state of the switch control signal S3, third<br>
switched diode element 220 will function as a diode or a short.<br>
[0029] Fourth switched diode element 222 is coupled between node 234<br>
and second high node 208. For the illustrated embodiment, fourth switched<br>
diode element 222 is directly connected between node 234 and second high<br>
node 208. For this particular embodiment, fourth switched diode element 222<br>
includes a switch in parallel with a diode. The switch may be realized as a<br>
transistor-based switch, e.g., a BJT as shown in FIG. 2. Of course, an<br>
implementation of DC-to-DC converter 200 may use other transistor-based<br>
switches in this context. Here, the cathode of the diode is coupled to the<br>
collector of the BJT, and the anode of the diode is coupled to the emitter of the<br>
BJT. The base of the BJT of fourth switched diode element 222 receives the<br>
switch control signal S4 (see FIG. 1). For this particular embodiment, a<br>
relatively high level for switch control signal S4 causes the BJT switch to<br>
close, effectively shorting node 234 and second high node 208 together, while<br><br>
a relatively low level for switch control signal S4 causes the BJT switch to<br>
open, effectively inserting the diode between node 234 and second high node<br>
208 to prevent current flow across the diode from node 234 to second high<br>
node 208. Thus, depending upon the state of the switch control signal S4,<br>
fourth switched diode element 222 will function as a diode or a short.<br>
[0030] First capacitance element CI is coupled between first high node<br>
206 and node 234. In other words, first capacitance element CI is in parallel<br>
with second switched diode element 218. In the illustrated embodiment, first<br>
capacitance element CI is directly connected between first high node 206 and<br>
node 234. Similarly, second capacitance element C2 is coupled between node<br>
234 and second high node 208. In other words, second capacitance element<br>
C2 is in parallel with fourth switched diode element 222. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, second capacitance element CI is directly connected between<br>
node 234 and second high node 208. The amount of capacitance provided by<br>
capacitance elements CI and C2 will vary from one implementation to<br>
another. For a typical deployment in an electric or hybrid electric traction<br>
system, each of the capacitance elements CI and C2 has a capacitance within<br>
the range of about 0.01 to about 0.10 F.<br>
[0031] Referring again to FIG. 1, switch controller 104 is suitably<br>
configured to generate switch control signals Q1, Q2, S1, S2, S3, and S4 in<br>
accordance with desired switching patterns to support the operation of DC-to-<br>
DC converter 200. In this regard, switch controller 104 is coupled to first<br>
switch 210, second switch 212, first switched diode element 216, second<br>
switched diode element 218, third switched diode element 220, and fourth<br>
switched diode element 222 in a manner that accommodates the delivery of<br>
switch control signals Q1, Q2, S1, S2, S3, and S4 to their respective switching<br>
components. When DC-to-DC converter 200 is operating in the boost mode,<br>
switch controller 104 controls and regulates the boosting of a relatively low<br>
DC voltage to a relatively high DC voltage. When DC-to-DC converter 200 is<br>
operating in the buck mode, switch controller 104 controls and regulates the<br>
reduction of a relatively high DC voltage to a relatively low DC voltage. As<br><br>
described in more detail below, switch controller 104 is also suitably<br>
configured to support a light/no load buck mode of operation, during which<br>
switch controller 104 controls discharging of first capacitance element CI and<br>
second capacitance element C2 through secondary winding 226. In practice,<br>
switch controller 104 is suitably configured to regulate storage and release of<br>
inductive energy (that is associated with first input inductance element LI and<br>
second input inductance element L2) as needed by selectively activating the<br>
switching components under its control.<br>
[0032] DC-to-DC converter 200 utilizes first capacitance element CI and<br>
second capacitance element C2 in different operating modes. In the boost<br>
mode of operation, second switched diode element 218 and fourth switched<br>
diode element 222 are switched off, i.e., they are both set to function as<br>
diodes. For a light/no load condition during the boost mode of operation, first<br>
switched diode element 216, third switched diode element 220, first<br>
capacitance element C1, and second capacitance element C2 form a half<br>
bridge circuit that provides a low reverse energy flow to keep the DC output<br>
voltage regulated. During the boost mode of operation, capacitance element<br>
C1 and capacitance element C2 also provide overshoot protection for first<br>
switch 210 and second switch 212.<br>
[0033] In the buck mode of operation, first capacitance element CI and<br>
second capacitance element C2 provide soft switching for second switched<br>
diode element 218 and for fourth switched diode element 222. Notably, at<br>
light and no load conditions, first capacitance element CI and second<br>
capacitance element C2 are reset (i.e., at least partially discharged) to avoid<br>
high loss on second switched diode element 218 and fourth switched diode<br>
element 222. To this end, the control technique described herein resets first<br>
capacitance element CI and second capacitance element C2 using first switch<br>
210 and second switch 212 to effectively short transformer 214 during a<br>
discharge period while first switched diode element 216 or third switched<br>
diode element 220 is shorted. The shorting of transformer 214 provides a<br>
current path to charge and discharge first capacitance element C1 and second<br><br>
capacitance element C2 through leakage inductance L3 while first switched<br>
diode element 216 or third switched diode element 220 is shorted. The<br>
transformer leakage inductance L3 limits the charge and discharge current<br>
during this resetting process. The additional energy in leakage inductance L3<br>
during this resetting process will be returned to generate the DC output voltage<br>
when first switched diode element 216 or third switched diode element 220 is<br>
switched off (i.e., is set to function as a diode).<br>
[0034] The capacitor resetting methodology will be described below with<br>
reference to FIG. 3, which is a switch timing diagram corresponding to DC-to-<br>
DC converter 200 operating in a light/no load buck mode. FIG. 3 depicts the<br>
switch control signals for DC-to-DC converter 200 (switch control signals Q1,<br>
Q2, S1, S2, S3, and S4) on a common horizontal time axis. When a switch<br>
control signal is high, the respective switching component is closed; when a<br>
switch control signal is low, the respective switching component is open. In<br>
this regard, for each of the switched diode elements, the closed state represents<br>
a state where the respective switched diode element is set to function as a<br>
short, and the open state represents a state where the respective switched diode<br>
element is set to function as a diode.<br>
[0035] FIG. 3 generally depicts the switch timing utilized to support the<br>
light/no load buck mode of operation. The actual switching periods,<br>
open/closed switch durations, and other timing parameters will vary from one<br>
implementation to another, depending upon factors such as the rise/fall time of<br>
the transistors, parasitic capacitances in the circuit, the load being driven, and<br>
the like. In one deployment suitable for use with a traction system of an<br>
electric or hybrid electric vehicle, the switching periods are on the order of<br>
100 nanoseconds. Three discharge states and corresponding discharge periods<br>
are depicted in FIG. 3; in practice, the switching pattern can be repeated as<br>
needed throughout the light/no load buck mode. The leftmost shaded region<br>
represents a first discharge state 302, the centered shaded region represents a<br>
second discharge state 304, and the rightmost shaded region represents a third<br>
discharge state 306. For this embodiment, first discharge state 302 and third<br><br>
discharge state 306 each corresponds to a respective period of time during<br>
which: first switch 210 is closed; second switch 212 is closed; first switched<br>
diode element 216 is set to function as a short; second switched diode element<br>
218 is set to function as a diode; third switched diode element 220 is set to<br>
function as a diode; and fourth switched diode element is set to function as a<br>
diode. At the beginning of the first discharge period (and at the beginning of<br>
the third discharge period) switch controller 104 closes first switch 210 to<br>
enable discharging of first capacitance element C1 and second capacitance<br>
element C2 through secondary winding 226. The switched components are<br>
maintained in their respective states for the duration of the first discharge state<br>
302 and for the duration of the third discharge state 306. At the end of the first<br>
discharge period (and at the end of the third discharge period) switch<br>
controller 104 switches second switched diode element 218 to its shorted state.<br>
[0036] For this embodiment, second discharge state corresponds to a<br>
period of time during which: first switch 210 is closed; second switch 212 is<br>
closed; first switched diode element 216 is set to function as a diode; second<br>
switched diode element 218 is set to function as a diode; third switched diode<br>
element 220 is set to function as a short; and fourth switched diode element<br>
222 is set to function as a diode. At the beginning of the second discharge<br>
period switch controller 104 closes second switch 212 to enable discharging of<br>
first capacitance element CI and second capacitance element C2 through<br>
secondary winding 226. The switched components are maintained in their<br>
respective states for the duration of the second discharge state 304. At the end<br>
of the second discharge period switch controller 104 switches fourth switched<br>
diode element 222 to its shorted state.<br>
[0037] Switch controller 104 establishes a pre-discharge state immediately<br>
prior to first discharge state 302. As shown in FIG. 3, this pre-discharge state<br>
corresponds to a period of time during which: first switch 210 is open; second<br>
switch 212 is closed; first switched diode element 216 is set to function as a<br>
short; second switched diode element 218 is set to function as a diode; third<br>
switched diode element 220 is set to function as a diode; and fourth switched<br><br>
diode element 222 is set to function as a diode. The end of this pre-discharge<br>
state corresponds to the beginning of first discharge state 302, i.e., when first<br>
switch 210 transitions from its open state to its closed state. An equivalent<br>
pre-discharge state occurs immediately prior to third discharge state 306.<br>
[0038] Switch controller 104 establishes a post-discharge state<br>
immediately following first discharge state 302. As depicted in FIG. 3, this<br>
post-discharge state corresponds to a period of time during which: first switch<br>
210 is closed; second switch 212 is closed; first switched diode element 216 is<br>
set to function as a diode; second switched diode element 218 is set to function<br>
as a short; third switched diode element 220 is set to function as a diode; and<br>
fourth switched diode element 222 is set to function as a diode. The beginning<br>
of this post-discharge state corresponds to the end of first discharge state 302,<br>
i.e., when first switched diode element 216 transitions from its shorted state to<br>
its diode state and when second switched diode element 218 transitions from<br>
its diode state to its shorted state. An equivalent post-discharge state occurs<br>
immediately following third discharge state 306.<br>
[0039] Switch controller 104 also establishes a pre-discharge state<br>
immediately prior to second discharge state 304. As shown in FIG. 3, this pre-<br>
discharge state corresponds to a period of time during which: first switch 210<br>
is closed; second switch 212 is open; first switched diode element 216 is set to<br>
function as a diode; second switched diode element 218 is set to function as a<br>
diode; third switched diode element 220 is set to function as a short; and<br>
fourth switched diode element 222 is set to function as a diode. The end of<br>
this pre-discharge state corresponds to the beginning of second discharge state<br>
304, i.e., when second switch 212 transitions from its open state to its closed<br>
state.<br>
[0040] Switch controller 104 also establishes a post-discharge state<br>
immediately following second discharge state 304. As depicted in FIG. 3, this<br>
post-discharge state corresponds to a period of time during which: first switch<br>
210 is closed; second switch 212 is closed; first switched diode element 216 is<br>
set to function as a diode; second switched diode element 218 is set to function<br><br>
as a diode; third switched diode element 220 is set to function as a diode; and<br>
fourth switched diode element 222 is set to function as a short. The beginning<br>
of this post-discharge state corresponds to the end of second discharge state<br>
304, i.e., when third switched diode element 220 transitions from its shorted<br>
state to its diode state and when fourth switched diode element 222 transitions<br>
from its diode state to its shorted state.<br>
[0041] The capacitor resetting procedure and switching technique<br>
described above allows first capacitance element CI and second capacitance<br>
element C2 to discharge through transformer 226 (the shorting of first switch<br>
210 and second switch 212 is reflected onto secondary winding 226 to<br>
effectively establish a direct conductive path from node 234 to the end of<br>
leakage inductance L3). More specifically, during first discharge state 302<br>
first capacitance element CI can discharge through secondary winding 226 via<br>
the shorted path created by first switched diode element 216. When second<br>
switched diode element 218 is switched to its shorted state a moment later,<br>
first capacitance element CI has already been discharged, which eliminates<br>
switching loss through second switched diode element 218. Similarly, during<br>
second discharge state 304 second capacitance element C2 can discharge<br>
through secondary winding 226 via the shorted path created by third switched<br>
diode element 220. When fourth switched diode element 222 is switched to its<br>
shorted state a moment later, second capacitance element C2 has already been<br>
discharged, which eliminates switching loss through fourth switched diode<br>
element 222. In contrast, a traditional approach that discharges capacitors<br>
through second switched diode element 218 and fourth switched diode<br>
element 222 is inefficient and results in high loss.<br>
