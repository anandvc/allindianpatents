				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel hydroxy functionalized adamantyl substituted 6-arylvinyl-1,2,4-trioxanes the present invention particularly relates to a novel series of antimalarial 1,2,4-trioxanes analogues of general formula 8<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein X represents the groups like OCH2CH2OH, OC2CH2OCOCH2CH2COOH whereas R1 and R2 represents the alkyl group selected from methyl or part of a cyclic systems such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane and adamantane and the preparation thereof; several of these novel compounds show promising antimalarial activity against multi-drug resistant malaria in mice.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Malaria, endemic in many parts of the tropical countries, with approximately 300-500 million<br>
episodes of clinical infection and nearly 2 million deaths per year worldwide, is a serious health problem. The rapid emergence of resistance by Plasmodium falciparum to existing therapies has added new dimensions to this problem. Against this background discovery of artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone Endoperoxide, isolated from the Chinese traditional herbal remedy against malaria, Artemisia annua, has been a welcome development in the chemotherapy of malaria. Some of the semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin e.g. artemether, arteether and artesunic acid are more active than artemisinin and are currently being used clinically. These drugs are effective against both cholroquin sensitive and chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. [For background literature on artemisinin and its derivatives see: (a) Klayman, D. L Science 1985, 225, 1049. (b) Zaman, s. s.; Sharma, R.P. Heterocycles 1991,32,1593. (c) Jung, M. Curr. Med.

The limited availability of artemisinin from natural sources and the realization that 1,2,4-trioxane<br>
is the pharmacophore for the antimalarial activity of artemisinin and its analogues, has inspired major<br>
efforts towards the preparation and bioevaluation of structurally simple synthetic 1,2,4-trioxanes. As<br>
a result of these efforts, a number of methodologies have been developed by various workers for the<br>
preparation of 1,2,4-trioxanes	. Several of these synthetic trioxanes<br>
have shown promising antimalarial activities both in vitro and in vivo [(a) Peters, W.; Robinson, B. L.; Tovey, G.; Rossier, J. C.; Jefford, C. W. Ann. Trap. Med. Parasitol. 1993, 87, 1-7.

These unsaturated esters of formula 5 can be isolated and purified by the standard procedure such as column chromatography using silica gel as an adsorbent or by crystallization in suitable solvent. The o;/?-unsaturated esters of formula 5 are new compounds and have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process reduction of o;/?-unsaturated esters of formula 5 is effected with LiAlH4 in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether to furnish allylic alcohol of formula 6. These allyl alcohols can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory procedures such as crystallization or column chromatography on silica gel. The allylic alcohols of formula 6 are new compounds and have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process of photooxygenation of allylic alcohols of formula 6 is effected by passing oxygen gas in the solution of the alcohol in an organic solvent such as THF, CHC13, CH3CN and in the presence of a sensitizer dye such as methylene blue and a light source which provides visible light to furnish /3-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula 7 which are used in the next step without further purification. The dye that acts as sensitizer converts 3O2 to highly reactive 'O2.<br>
In the process &gt;S-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula 7 are reacted in situ with ketones of formula 9 in an aprotic solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst such as HC1 to furnish trioxanes of formula 8 wherein X is OCH2CH2OH. The ketones can be selected from acetone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone or tricyclic ketones such as 2-adamantanone and the like. These trioxanes of formula<br>
8 can be purified by the standard laboratory procedures such as column chromatography and crystallization. The trioxanes of formula 8 (X = OCH2CH2OH) are the new chemical entities and these have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process for preparing hemisuccinate derivatives of formula 8 (X = OCH2CH2OCOCH2CH2COOH) by reacting trioxanes of formula 8 (X = OCH2CH2OH) with succinic anhydride and triethylamine in the presence of catalytic DMAP in dichloromethane. These hen .isuccinate derivatives can be purified by the standard laboratory procedures such as column chromatography and crystallization. The hemisuccinate derivatives of formula 8 (X = OCH2CH2OCOCH2CH2COOH) are the new chemical entities and these have not been prepared earlier. (Scheme-1).<br>
Some of these trioxanes have been tested against malarial parasite in mice and show promising antimalarial activity.<br>
