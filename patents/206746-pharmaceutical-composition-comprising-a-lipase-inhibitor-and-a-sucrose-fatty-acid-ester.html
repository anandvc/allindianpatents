The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a lipase inhibitor, preferably orlistat, having a melting point &gt; 37°C, a sucrose fatty acid ester wherein the sucrose fatty acid ester is a mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-ester, and optionally one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients.<br>
Examples of such lipase inhibitors are lipstatin and orlistat. The latter is also known as tetrahydrolipstatin or THL and is derived from a natural product excreted by Streptomyces toxytricini. This class of compounds was found to exhibit in vitro as well as in vivo activity against various lipases, such as lingual lipase, pancreatic lipase, gastric lipase, and carboxylester lipase. Its use for the control or prevention of obesity and hyperlipidemia is described, for instance, in US Patent 4,598,089.<br>
Orlistat is currently administered at doses of 120 mg per meal and dosing is independent of the body mass of the human subject. Orlistat acts locally in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and prevents lipase from digesting triglycerides and thus inhibits the formation of absorbable lipid degradation products. For this reason, systemic availability of the lipase inhibitors is not required and, instead, local residence in the gastrointestinal tract is preferred.<br>
Lipase inhibitor compositions currently administered inhibit around 30% of fat absorption after consumption of a mixed meal; increasing the concentrations of lipase inhibitors in the pharmaceutical composition does not increase its clinical efficacy and/or potency while the intensity of local side effects increases.<br><br>
Anal leakage of oil (oily spotting) is an adverse effect, which is occasionally observed by patients treated with lipase inhibitors. This phenomenon reflects physical separation df some liquid unabsorbed dietary fat from the bulk of solids in the lower large intestine.<br>
In US Patent No. 5,447,953 it was shown that by combining a lipase inhibitor with substantial amounts of water insoluble crude fibers, the inhibiting effect on fat absorption can be increased. In patent application WO00/09123 is has been demonstrated that by combining a lipase inhibitor such as orlistat with low amounts of chitosan or a derivative or a salt thereof, the phenomenon of anal leakage of oil can be reduced.<br>
International Patent Application WO01/19378 discloses solid lipid formulations for lipase inhibitors useful to reduce or prevent fat excretion and unwanted formation of free oil. It has been found that a higher efficacy (high fat excretion) can be combined with a lowering of unwanted side effects, e.g. free oil. Recently it has been recognized that the efficacy of lipase inhibitors may depend strongly on the kind of the ingested food. A high efficacy have been found with meals composed of French fries, sausages and hamburgers, while lower efficacy was observed for cheese and other dairy products. Strong food dependency of the formulation efficacy is an unwanted phenomena, because either the formulation is overdosed in susceptible diets (with the consequence of free oil formation) or not active in less susceptible diets. Therefore, the decrease of the food dependency is a prerequisite to realize scenarios with a low dosage of the inhibitor, a high efficacy and less fewer side effects.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that a certain sucrose fatty acid ester subgroup can increase the activities of lipase inhibitors, decrease the food dependency and decreasing the formation of free oil.<br>
FIGURES:<br>
Fig. 1 indicates that the sucrose ester based formulations show an approximate 1.7 times higher efficacy 240 mg SUCROSEESTER P1670: 67.4 (±5.3 %, n=5), 30 rng SUCROSEESTER P1670 66.6 (±13 %, n=4) compared to Xenical 39.7 (±8.1 %, n=5) in a double meal test on human volunteers.<br>
i	Fig. 2 indicates that the efficacy of Xenical in the less accessible meal was only 48.4 %<br>
compared to the accessible, while the sucrose ester formulation 30 MG SUCROSEESTER P1670 reached 73.9 % (double meal test in human volunteers).<br><br>
Fig, 3 displays test emulsions of Surfhope SE Pharma D-1811 after centrifugation at 3100 g for t = 1 min (a) and f = 300 min (b), respectively. The emulsion containing 2.0% (w/w) sucrose ester remains even after a centrifugation time of t = 300 min stable (picture (b), right capillary). From left to right: reference (mixture soya oil/buffer); c= 0.01%, c = 0.1%; c= 0.5%; c = 1.0%; c= 1.5%; c = 2.0% (w/w).<br>
Fig. 4 shows test emulsions of Surfhope SE Pharma D-1811 after centrifugation at 3100 g for t = 1 min (a) and t = 300 min (b), respectively.  The emulsions are stabilized with 1.0% (w/w) sucrose ester at different pH values. Whereas emulsions at pH  7 noticeably revealed less free oil.<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a lipase inhibitor, preferably orlistat, having a melting point &gt; 37°C, a sucrose fatty acid ester wherein the sucrose fatty acid ester is a mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-ester, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Sucrose fatty acid esters are nonionic surfactants consisting of sucrose as hydrophilic moiety and one or more fatty acid moieties as lipophilic group(s). They are manufactured from purified sugar and vegetable oils. As sucrose has a total of 8 hydroxyl groups, compounds ranging from sucrose mono to octa fatty acid esters can be produced. The following formula shows as an example the chemical structure of sucrose monostearate:<br><br>
The term "sucrose fatty acid ester" comprises one single sucrose fatty acid ester as well as a mixture of two or more sucrose ester fatty acids as defined below. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the substitution degree of sucrose ester varies between 1 and 4; e.g. mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-ester of fatty acids with sucrose. The term includes pure sucroseesters as well as mixtures of sucroseesters, wherein the sucroseester might be esterified by different fatty acids and might have several substitution degrees, e.g. mono-, di-, tri- or tetra-substituted.<br><br>
Sucrose fatty acid ester and mixtures thereof and there preparation are known in the art and commercially available (Mitsubishi-Kagaku Foods Corp., Montello Inc., Multi-   - ■    • Kem Corp., etc.; see also Garti, N.; Clement, V.; Leser, M.; Aserin, A.; Fanun, M. Sucrose ester microemulsions. J. Mol Liq. (1999), 80(2,3), 253-296; Carbohydrate-alkyl ester derivatives as biosurfactants. Allen, D.K.; Tao, B.Y., J. Surfactants Deterg. (1999), 2(3), 383-390.).<br>
The term "lipase inhibitor" refers to compounds which are capable of inhibiting the action of lipases, for example gastric and pancreatic lipases. For example, orlistat and lipstatin as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,598,089 are potent inhibitors of lipases. Lipstatin is a natural product of microbial origin, and orlistat is the result of a hydrogenation of lipstatin. Other lipase inhibitors include a class of compounds commonly referred to as panclicins. Panclicins are analogues of orlistat (Mutoh et al, /. Antibiot (1994), 47(12), 1369-1375). The term "lipase inhibitor" refers also to synthetic lipase inhibitors for example described in International Patent Application W099/34786 (Geltex Pharmaceuticals Inc.). These polymers are characterized in that they have been substituted with one or more groups that inhibit lipases. The term "lipase inhibitor" also comprises pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these compounds. In addition, the term "lipase inhibitor" also refers to 2-oxy-4H-3,l-benzoxazin-4-ones which have been described in International Patent Application WO00/40569 (Alizyme Therapeutics Ltd.), e.g. 2-decyloxy-6-methyl-4H-3,l-benzoxazin-4-one, 6-methyl-2-tetradecyloxy-4H-3,l-benzoxazin-4-one, and2-hexadecyloxy-6-methyl-4H-3,l-benzoxazin-4-one and other oxetanones described for example in International Patent Applications WO01/32616, WOO 1/32669 and WO01/32670. Most preferably, the term "lipase inhibitor" refers to orlistat.<br>
In German Patent DE1965133 (Merck) some poly(styrene) derived polymers are described which exhibit direct lipase inhibition next to bile acid and triglyceride binding properties.<br>
Orlistat is a known compound (formula I) useful for the control or prevention of obesity and hyperlipidemia.<br><br><br>

Further suitable pharmaceutical compositions are described for example in International Patent Applications WO00/09122, WOOO/09123, WO01/19340 and WO01/19378. Additional processes for the preparation of orlistat are disclosed in European Patent Applications Publication Nos. 185,359, 189,577,443,449, and 524,495.<br>

The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples which illustrate but do not limit the invention described herein.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
General remarks: All compounds used in the examples are commercially available.<br><br>
Orlistat (4mg) suspensions stabilized by sucroseesters (2mg) were transferred into 5ml of a 10% oil in water emulsion (pH value 4.5; oil components: olive oil and cream respectively). The dispersion underwent end-over end mixing for a desired period of time. The oil phase was separated by cold centrifugation and the orlistat content in the oil phase was determined by HPLC. For comparison, an adequate experiment was also performed with a suspension of XENICAL®. L-1695, P-1670, S-1670, O-1570 are commercial sucroseesters (Sucroselaurate, Sucrosepalmitate, Sucrosestearate, Sucroseoleate respectively) from Mitsubishi-Kagaku Foods, Japan.<br>
The results indicate that the sucroseester have a higher efficacy of the transfer orlistat transfer into oil compared to XENICAL®. In addition to a general higher transfer efficacy and in contrast to XENICAL®, orlistat is transferred into different kind of oils (cream: emulsified and casein covered oily droplets; olive oil: unprotected oil) at more comparable rates. The high food dependency of orlistat is reflected in the fact, that the transfer after 10 min into olive oil is 7 times more efficient than the transfer into cream. The sucrose ester<br><br>
show less food dependency. Therefore, a dose reduction and decreased side effects can be expected.<br>
Example 2: Tablet formulation Chewable tablets of the following composition were made:<br><br>
Orlistat, sucrosepalmitate and maltodextrin were homogeneously mixed and 350 g water were added stepwise under continuous mixing.<br>
With the help of a syringe the homogeneous dispersion were spread on a sieve (mesh size 0.5 mm) in tracks. The sieve was put into a vacuum drying oven (Heraeus VT 5050 EK) which was tempered to 25 °C. Chamber pressure was lowered to 30 Torr (Leybold Heraeus TRIVAC D8B; COMAT AG DPI 700). After 5 minutes, the development of a foam structure was completed. The foam was dried in vacuum for several hours. Care was taken to control that the temperature of the foam did not exceed 35°C. The resulting foam was desintegrated and sieved in order to achieve a homogenous flowable powder. Cellactose and talcum were added and homogeneously distributed by dry mixing. The resulting composition was tableted into tablets containing Orlistat 120 mg, Sucrosepalmitate 30 mg, Maltodextrin 960 mg, Cellactose 360 mg, and Talcum 15 mg.<br><br>
Example 3: Chewable tablet formulation<br>
Chewable tablets of the following composition were made:<br><br>
The tablets were made by the same procedure as described in Example 2.<br>
Example 4: Chewable tablet formulation Chewable tablets of the following composition were made:<br><br>
The tablets were made by the same procedure as described in Example 2.<br><br>
Example 5: Chewable tablet formulation Chewable tablets of the following composition were made:<br><br>
The tablets were made by the same procedure as described in Example 2.<br>
Example 6: Chewable tablet formulation Chewable tablets of the following composition were made:<br><br>
The tablets were made by the same procedure as described in Example 2.<br><br>
Example 7: Chewable tablet formulation Zhewable tablets of the following composition were made;<br><br>
The tablets were made by the same procedure as described in Example 2.<br>
Example 8: Pellet formulation<br><br>
The ingredients are dry mixed together in a high speed mixer Diosna P50). 240 g water are added stepwise and the mixing process is continued for about 5 minutes. An extruder is fed with this material (NICA lab E-140; screen 0.8 mm mesh size, thickness 1.0 mm, screen surrounded by cooling device). The material is extruded to spaghettis of appropriate length. The temperature of the extrudate does not exceed 35°C. The extrudate is transferred to a spheronizer ((NICA lab S320) and spheronized for 0.5 to 3 minutes at 700 rpm. The wet pellets are dried in a fluidized bed dryer (Aeromatic, MP-1) at a temperature of below 35°C. The dried pellets are sieved with sieve inserts of 0.5 and 1.25<br><br>
mm mesh size, and under- and oversize fractions are discarded. The pellets are filled into a sachet at doses of 106 mg (corresponding to 60mg orlistat).<br>
Example 9: Capsule formulation<br>
The above pellets are filled into Gelatine capsules size I at a dosage of 106 mg (corresponding to 60 mg Orlistat).<br>
Example 10: Tablet formulation<br>
Magnesium stearate is added to the pellets described in Example 8 at a level of 1% (w/w) and homogeneously distributed by appropriate mixing. The mixture is compressed into 107 mg tablets which correspond to 60 mg Orlistat.<br>
Example 11: In vitro efficacy<br>
Table : Reduced food-dependent efficacy of sucrose ester based orlistat formulations in an in-vitro lipase inhibition assay with accessible and resistant fat. Xenical pellets and Tablets from Example 2 and Example 3 were investigated. Water was added to a dispersed tablet to yield a orlistat concentration of 6.64 mg/ml. The sample was stirred for 15 min and a geometric dilution series was prepared. An aliquot from each dilution step was mixed with substrate and assessed for lipase inhibition. The final emulsion contained 2.5 % (w/v) fat and 10 mg/ml USP pancreatin.<br><br><br>
The in-vitro lipase test mimics the gastrointestinal fat digestion and assesses formulation dependent inhibition of lipolysis. In this test lipase substrate (cream and grained hamburger/ french fries, representing resistant and accessible fat, respectively) is preincubated with a THL-formulation under simulated gastric conditions (i. e. at pH 4.5 in the presence of 20 % human gastric fluid). During this preincubation, the formulation can load fat droplets with THL. Lipolysis is then started by adding artificial intestinal fluid, containing bile salts, phospholipids and hydrolytic enzymes (pancreatin). After one hour organic solvent is added to stop the reaction and free fatty acids are quantified. The dose-response curve is dependent on the formulation as well as on the type of substrate employed.<br>
The IC50 value is the concentration which inhibits triglyceride cleavage by 50%. A high food dependency was observed for Xenical, the IC50 increased by a factor of 20. The in-vitro food dependency of the sucrose ester based formulations was about 6-times less compared to Xenical.<br><br>
Example 12: Efficacy in vivo<br>
The 120 mg Orlistat tablet formulations described in Example 2 (30 mg iucrosepalmitate) and Example 3 (240 mg Sucrosepalmitate), and Xenical were tested on mman volunteers by means of a double-meal test, which is composed of accessible fat Lunch: Hamburger, French fries and a less accessible fat (Dinner: cheese meal). The lonabsorbed fat was determined after Bligh &amp; Dyer (Bligh, E.G.; Dyer, WJ. Can. J. Siochem.Physiol 37 (1959) 911).<br>
The results indicate (Fig. 1) that the sucrose ester based formulations show an approximate 1.7 times higher efficacy formulation with 240 mg SUCROSEESTER P1670:<br>
67.4 (±5.3 %, n=5), formulation with 30 mg SUCROSEESTER P1670 66.6 (±13 %, n=4)<br>
compared to Xenical 39,7 (±8.1 %, n=5).<br>
Example 13: Food dependency in vivo<br>
The fatty acid specific analysis of the stool permits the selective determination of the fat uptake of the lunch and dinner meal respectively. The results indicate (Fig. 2) that the efficacy of Xenical in the less accessible meal was only 48.4 % compared to the accessible, while the sucrose ester formulation 30 mg SUCROSEESTER P1670 reached 73.9 %. It can be concluded from these data that the food dependency of orlistat can be substantially minimized by sucrose ester based formulations.<br>
Example 14: Side effect in vitro studies<br>
Among various other strategies to control anal leakage, the generation of stable dietary fat emulsion in the colon is of high importance. Therefore, the emulsification properties of sucrose esters covering a wide range of hydrophile-lipophile-balance (HLB) values were investigated using a centrifugal method. This in vitro method allowed both concentration and pH-depended emulsion stabilities to examine and thus to select the sucrose esters of highest potential to control side-effects. The results of the concentration depended emulsion stability studies are listed in Tables 1-3.<br><br><br><br>

*low: oil and water form two distinct clearly separated phases; medium: emulsion partly broken; high: no indications of coalescence, optically non-transparent, stable emulsion<br>
Sucrose esters such as Surfhope SE Pharma D-1811 (Table 2) with a medium HLB value of 11 proofed to be slightly superior in their ability to stabilize an emulsion with respect to Surfhope SE Pharma D-1815 (Table 1) and Surfhope SE Pharma D-1805 (Table 3), respectively. At concentrations of 2.0 % (w/w) Surfhope SE Pharma D-1811 revealed stable emulsions without any visual signs of coalescence at centrifugation times up to t = 300 min (Figure 1). Both, Surfhope SE Pharma D-1815 and Surfhope SE Pharma D-1805 showed only slightly less stable emulsion stabilities. In addition, measurements with similarly prepared emulsions stored at room temperature for 1 week without applying any centrifugal force revealed that the conditions generated in the centrifugation experiment correlates to a normal standing period of about 2-3 days, which compares well to the average gastro-intestinal transit time in humans.<br>
Figure 3 displays test emulsions of Surfhope SE Pharma D-1811 after centrifugation at 3100 g for t = 1 min (a) and t - 300 min (b), respectively. The emulsion containing 2.0% (w/w) sucrose ester remains even after a centrifugation time of t = 300 min stable (picture (b), right capillary). From left to right: reference (mixture soya oil/buffer); c = 0.01%, c = 0.1%; c = 0.5%; c = 1.0%; c = 1.5%; c = 2.0% (w/w).<br>
Similar emulsion stability tests were conducted using combinations of sucrose esters and hydrocolloids (e.g., xanthan gum, gellan gum, carrageenan gum), sphingomyelin, aerosil derivatives, calcium carboxymethylcellulose, chitosan, bentonites, whey protein concentrates, pectins, and poly(vinyl alcohol). Interestingly, these studies showed that 1:1 combinations (w/w) of Surfhope SE Pharma D-1815 and Aerosil 200, carrageenan gum, and whey protein concentrates gave emulsions with clearly better stability than the single compounds alone, due to a yet unknown synergistic mechanism.<br><br>
In order to investigate emulsion stability at various pH values&gt; test emulsions with a surfactant concentration of c = 1.0% w/w covering the range from pH 4 to 9 were'prepared (Table 4-7). At pH values &gt; 7 all sucrose fatty acid esters investigated showed good emulsification properties. After centrifugation times of 300 min only a small free upper oil phase separated from the optically non-transparent emulsion phase. Sucrose esters with an HLB value below 11 gave only poor emulsification at pH values

Figure 4 shows test emulsions of Surfhope SE Pharma D-1811 after centrifugation at 3100 g for t = 1 min (a) and t = 300 min (b), respectively. The emulsions are stabilized with 1.0% (w/w) sucrose ester at different pH values. Whereas emulsions at pH  7 noticeably revealed less free oil. From left to right: reference (mixture soya oil/buffer) at pH = 7; pH = 4, pH =5; pH = 6; pH = 7; pH = 8; pH = 9.<br>
In contrast, Sucrose Fatty Acid Ester S-370F revealed very bad emulsification properties. Due to the high hydrophobicity of the compound solubility in the continuous aqueous phase was very low. However, the compound is very easily soluble in soya bean oil resulting in a significant increase in oil viscosity.<br>
Example 15: Side effect in vivo studies<br>
An in vivo mouse model was developed to investigate the ability of sucrose esters to reduce the free oil formation after Orlistat treatment. Orlistat was mixed with butter and added to the feed. The concentration of Orlistat administered to the mice was 150|imol Orlistat/kg body weight. The experiment is based on the observation that mice under a high fat diet treated with Orlistat or other lipase inhibitors distribute the excreted free oil over their furs while grooming (United States Patent, Patent Number 5.431.949). A variety of sucrose esters as mentioned above were examined for their ability to reduce or eliminate (    the production of free oil. The results of these studies are summarized in Figure 5.<br><br>
In this representation, the excretion of free oil by a control group which received Orlistat but-no gastrointestinal side effect controlling agent was taken as background level and arbitrarily set to zero. Any improvements in free oil production are given as minus per cent value relative to the background. These experiments revealed that sucrose esters such as Surfhope D-1811 or Surfhope D-1805 with a medium HLB value show the highest relative reduction in free oily excretion. In contrast, sucrose esters on either end of the HLB scale which are either very hydrophilic (Surfhope D-1815) or very lipophilic (Surfhope D-1803) show less activity.<br>
