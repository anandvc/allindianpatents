				<td>A CONTROL DEVICE FOR A FOUR STROKE ENGINE AND<br>
CONTROL METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an engine control device for<br>
controlling an engine and, more particularly to an engine control<br>
device suitable for controlling an engine provided with a fuel<br>
injection device for injecting fuel.<br>
Background Art<br>
With the widespread of fuel injection devices called<br>
injector in recent years, control of fuel injection timing and<br>
fuel injection amount, namely, the air-fuel ratio has become easy,<br>
which makes it possible to improve engine output and fuel<br>
consumption and to clean exhaust gas. As to the fuel injection<br>
timing, it is common that a phase state of a camshaft, a state of<br>
an intake valve, to be exact, is detected, and, based on the<br>
detected result, fuel is injected. However, a cam sensor for<br>
detecting the phase state of the camshaft, which is expensive and<br>
increases the size of a cylinder head, is difficult to employ in<br>
motorcycles or the like, in particular. To solve this problem,<br>
an engine control device adapted to detect a phase state of a<br>
crankshaft and an intake pipe pressure and, based on those, to<br>
detect a stroke state of a cylinder is proposed in JP-A-H10-<br>
227252. With this prior art, it is possible to detect a stroke<br>
state of a cylinder without detecting a phase of a camshaft, so<br>
that it is possible to control fuel injection timing based on the<br>
stroke state.<br>
To inject fuel from a fuel injection device as mentioned<br>
above, the fuel in the fuel tank must be pressurized by a fuel<br>
pump before supplied to the fuel injection device. As is well<br>
known, since the pressure of the fuel pressurized by the pump<br>
fluctuates, a pressure control valve called regulator is used to<br>
provide an upper limit on the fuel pressure. In the case of a<br>
motorcycle, the regulator is generally provided in the close<br>
vicinity of the fuel injection device and is usually so<br>
constituted that a prescribed regulator control pressure usually<br>
set by a spring or the like is added to the fuel on top of a<br>
pressure of an atmosphere into which the fuel is injected by the<br>
fuel injection device, for example, a pressure in an intake pipe,<br>
as a back pressure. Thus, the fuel injection pressure, which is<br>
a difference between the pressure of the fuel supplied to the<br>
fuel injection device and the pressure of the atmosphere into<br>
which the fuel is injected, is always equivalent to the regulator<br>
control pressure of the regulator.<br>
However, when the regulator is provided in the close<br>
vicinity of the fuel injection device, a return line for<br>
returning surplus fuel from the regulator to the fuel tank must<br>
be provided for each fuel injection device. Also, in most cases,<br>
the regulator is manufactured by the same manufacturer of the<br>
pump but, when the pump and the regulator are disposed separately,<br>
they are supplied separately. This increased the number of parts<br>
and makes cost reduction by making parts into assemblies<br>
impossible. Then, it can be thought to place the regulator in<br>
the vicinity of the pump by, for example, making the pump and the<br>
regulator into an assembly. This constitution not only makes the<br>
return line unnecessary but also makes it possible to reduce the<br>
number of parts and the costs.<br>
However, in the event that the regulator is disposed on the<br>
pump side as has been described above, since the back pressure of<br>
the regulator is constituted by the atmospheric pressure, where<br>
the atmospheric pressure changes as the altitude changes, the<br>
fuel pressure also changes. There has been proposed a fuel<br>
injection control method which is described, for example, in JP-<br>
A-S61-178526 as a method for compensating for a change in fuel<br>
pressure caused when the atmospheric pressure fluctuates. In<br>
this fuel injection control method, an atmospheric pressure is<br>
detected by an atmospheric pressure sensor, whereby the fuel<br>
injection amount is corrected based, for example, on a ratio<br>
between a reference atmospheric pressure and an atmospheric<br>
pressure so detected. According to this method, while the fuel<br>
injection amount can be compensated irrespective of the<br>
fluctuation of atmospheric pressure, the atmospheric pressure<br>
sensor is needed, and the number of components is increased by<br>
the additional of such a component, this leading to an increase<br>
in production costs.<br>
When the regulator is placed in the vicinity of the pump,<br>
the back pressure of the regulator must be ambient pressure, so<br>
that the pressure of the fuel supplied to the fuel injection<br>
device is generally constant (When the ambient pressure changes<br>
with altitude, for example, the fuel pressure is also changed.).<br>
On the other hand, when no surge tank is provide in the intake<br>
pipe as in the case of motorcycles, the pressure in the intake<br>
pipe into which the fuel is injected, namely the pressure of the<br>
atmosphere into which the fuel is injected is changeable. This<br>
means that the injection fuel pressure, which is the difference<br>
between the pressure of the fuel supplied to the fuel injection<br>
device and the pressure of the atmosphere into which the fuel is<br>
injected, is unstable. When the injection fuel pressure is<br>
unstable, the amount of fuel injected from the injection device<br>
per a unit time becomes unstable. This makes it impossible to<br>
obtain a fuel injection amount to attain a desired air-fuel ratio<br>
only by controlling the fuel injection time.<br>
As a device for correcting the fuel injection amount based<br>
on an injection fuel pressure, there is an engine control device<br>
disclosed in JA-A-H08-32 6581. The engine control device detects<br>
an injection fuel pressure, integrates it over a given period of<br>
time to obtain the area thereof, compares the area with reference<br>
area values, and corrects the fuel injection amount based on the<br>
comparison result. In this engine control device, however, the<br>
infection fuel pressure must be integrated, so that the operation<br>
load is unavoidably large. Also, since the reference values with<br>
which the integral value of the injection fuel pressure is<br>
compared must be organized into a map for every operation state<br>
of the engine and stored, a memory with a large capacity is<br>
needed. Naturally, the operation load in withdrawing the maps<br>
and making the comparison is large.<br>
The invention was made with a view to resolving the<br>
problems and an object thereof is to provide a control device for<br>
a four-stroke engine which can accurately control the fuel<br>
injection amount and time at a transitional time while reducing<br>
an operational load related to the control of fuel injection and<br>
which can attempt to reduce the number of components and<br>
production costs.<br>

Best mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be described below.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the<br>
configuration of, for example, a motorcycle engine and a control<br>
device therefor according to a first embodiment of the invention.<br>
The engine 1 is a four-cylinder, four-cycle engine and has a<br><br>
cylinder body 2, a crankshaft 3, a piston 4, a combustion chamber<br>
5, an intake pipe 6, an intake valve 7, an exhaust pipe 8, an<br>
exhaust valve 9, a spark plug 10, and an ignition coil 11. Note<br>
that the intake pipe 6, which is independent, is connected to<br>
each of four combustion chambers 5, a throttle valve 12 which<br>
functions as an intake control valve which opens and closes<br>
according to the position or opening of the throttle valve 12 is<br>
provided in each intake pipe 6, and an injector 13, which<br>
functions as a fuel injection device, is provided a downstream<br>
side of the throttle valve 12 or a combustion chamber side of the<br>
intake pipe 6. The injector 13 is connected to a filter 18, a<br>
fuel pump 17 and a regulator 16 which are housed in a fuel tank<br>
19. The regulator 16 provides an upper limit on the pressure<br>
applied to the fuel by the fuel pump 17. A regulator housed in<br>
the fuel tank 19 is arranged such that a prescribed regulator<br>
control pressure is applied with the ambient pressure serving as<br>
the back pressure. Thus, when the pump delivery pressure is<br>
lower than the regulator control pressure, the pump delivery<br>
pressure (more accurately, the pump delivery pressure including<br>
ambient pressure as a back pressure) is the pressure of the fuel<br>
supplied to the injector 13. The engine 1 employs an independent<br>
suction system, so that the injector 13 is provided in each<br>
intake pipe 6 of each cylinder.<br>
The operating state of the engine 1 is controlled by an<br>
engine control unit 15. As means for performing control input<br>
into the engine control unit 15, namely means for detecting the<br>
operating state of the engine 1, there are provided a crank angle<br>
sensor 20 for detecting the rotational angle, namely phase, of<br>
the crankshaft 3, a cooling water temperature sensor 21 for<br>
detecting the temperature of the cylinder body 2 or cooling water,<br><br>
namely the temperature of the engine body, an exhaust air-fuel<br>
ratio sensor 22 for detecting the air-fuel ratio in the exhaust<br>
pipe 8, a fuel pressure sensor 23 for detecting the fuel delivery<br>
pressure of the fuel pump 17 as the pressure of the fuel supplied<br>
to the injector 13, an intake pipe pressure sensor 24 for<br>
detecting the pressure of intake air in the intake pipe 6, and an<br>
intake air temperature sensor 25 for detecting the temperature in<br>
the intake pipe 6, namely the temperature of intake air. The<br>
engine control unit 15 receives detecting signals from the<br>
sensors and outputs control signals to the fuel pump 17, the<br>
injector 13 and the ignition coil 11.<br>
The engine control unit 15 is constituted of a<br>
microcomputer (not shown) and so on. Fig. 2 is a block diagram<br>
illustrating an embodiment of the engine control operation<br>
performed by the microcomputer in the engine control unit 15.<br>
The engine control operation is performed by an engine rotational<br>
speed calculating part 26 for calculating the engine rotational<br>
speed based on a crank angle signal, a crank timing detecting<br>
part 27 for detecting crank timing information, namely the stroke<br>
state based on the crank angle signal and an intake pipe pressure<br>
signal, an incylinder air mass calculating part 28 for<br>
calculating the air mass in the cylinder (amount of intake air)<br>
based on the crank timing information detected by the crank<br>
timing detecting part 27 together with an intake air temperature<br>
signal, an cooling water temperature (engine temperature) signal,<br>
the intake pipe pressure signal and the engine rotational speed<br>
calculated by the engine rotational speed calculating part 26, a<br>
target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33 for calculating a<br>
target air- fuel ratio based on the engine rotational speed<br>
calculated in the engine rotational speed calculating part 26 and<br><br>
the intake pipe pressure signal, a fuel injection amount<br>
calculating part 34 for calculating the amount of fuel to be<br>
injected based on the target air-fuel ratio calculated in the<br>
target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33, the intake pipe<br>
pressure signal and the air mass in the cylinder calculated in<br>
the incylinder air mass calculating part 28, an ambient pressure<br>
calculating part 41 for calculating the ambient pressure based on<br>
the intake pipe pressure signal and the crank timing information<br>
detected by the crank timing detecting part 27, a injection fuel<br>
pressure calculating part 42 for calculating the injection fuel<br>
pressure based on the ambient pressure calculated in the ambient<br>
pressure calculating part 41, the pressure of fuel supplied to<br>
the injector 13 detected by the fuel pressure sensor 23 and the<br>
intake pipe pressure signal, a fuel injection coefficient<br>
calculating part 43 for calculating a fuel injection coefficient<br>
based on the fuel injection pressure calculated in the fuel<br>
injection pressure calculating part 42, a fuel injection time<br>
calculating part 44 for calculating the fuel injection time based<br>
on the amount of fuel to be injected calculated in the fuel<br>
injection amount calculating part 34 and the fuel injection<br>
coefficient calculated in the fuel injection coefficient<br>
calculating part 43, an injection pulse output part 30 for<br>
outputting injection pulses to the injector 13 based on the fuel<br>
injection time calculated in the fuel injection time calculating<br>
part 44 and the crank timing information detected by the crank<br>
timing detecting part 27, an ignition timing calculating part 31<br>
for calculating ignition timing based on the engine rotational<br>
speed calculated in the engine rotational speed calculating part<br>
26 and the target air-fuel ratio set in the target air-fuel ratio<br>
calculating part 33, and an ignition pulse output part 32 for<br><br>
outputting ignition pulses corresponding to the ignition timing<br>
set in the ignition timing calculating part 31 to the ignition<br>
coil 11 based on the crank timing information detected by the<br>
crank timing information detecting part 27.<br>
The engine rotational speed calculating part 26 calculates<br>
the rotational speed of the crankshaft as an output shaft of the<br>
engine as the engine rotational speed based on the rate of change<br>
of the crank angle signal with time.<br>
The crank timing detecting part 27, which has a<br>
constitution similar to the stroke judging device disclosed in<br>
JA-A-H10-227252, detects the stroke state of each cylinder as<br>
shown in Fig. 3, for example, and outputs it as crank timing<br>
information. Namely, in a four-cycle engine, the crankshaft and<br>
the camshaft are constantly rotated with a prescribed phase<br>
difference, so that when crank pulses are read with respect to<br>
each 30 degrees rotation of the crank shaft as shown in Fig. 3,<br>
the crank pulse "4" represents either an exhaust stroke or a<br>
compression stroke. As is well known, during an exhaust stroke,<br>
the exhaust valve is closed and the intake valve is opened, so<br>
that the intake pipe pressure is high. However, in an initial<br>
stage of a compression stroke, the intake pipe pressure is low<br>
because the intake valve is still open or because of the previous<br>
intake stroke even if the intake valve is closed. Thus, the<br>
crank pulse "4" outputted when the intake pipe pressure is low<br>
indicates that a second cylinder is in a compression stroke, and<br>
when the crank pulse "3" is obtained, the second cylinder is at<br>
the intake bottom dead center. When the stroke state of one of<br>
the cylinders can be detected as above, since there are<br>
prescribed phase differences between the strokes of the cylinders,<br>
the stroke state of the other cylinders can be determined. For<br><br>
example, the first crank pulse "9" after the crank pulse "3"<br>
indicating that the second cylinder is at its intake bottom dead<br>
center indicates that the first cylinder is at its intake bottom<br>
dead center, the first clank pulse "3" after that indicates that<br>
the third cylinder is at its intake bottom dead center, and the<br>
first clan pulse "9" after that indicates that the fourth<br>
cylinder is at its intake bottom dead center. Then, when the<br>
intervals between the pulses are interpolated with the rotational<br>
speed of the crankshaft, the present stroke state can be detected<br>
in further detail.<br>
The incylinder air mass calculating part 28 has a three-<br>
dimensional map as shown in Fig. 4 for use in calculating the air<br>
mass in the cylinder based on the intake pipe pressure signal and<br>
the engine rotational speed calculated in the engine rotational<br>
speed calculating part 26. The three dimensional map of the<br>
incylinder air mass can be obtained only by measuring air mass in<br>
the cylinder while changing the intake pipe pressure with the<br>
engine rotated at a prescribed rotational speed. The measurement<br>
can be conducted with a relatively simple experiment, so that the<br>
map can be organized with ease. The map could be organized with<br>
an advanced engine simulation system. The incylinder air mass,<br>
which is changed with engine temperature, may be corrected with<br>
the cooling water temperature (engine temperature) signal.<br>
The target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33 has a three-<br>
dimensional map as shown in Fig. 5 for use in calculating the<br>
target air-fuel ratio based on the intake pipe pressure signal<br>
and the engine rotational speed calculated in the engine<br>
rotational speed calculating part 26. The three-dimensional map<br>
can be organized on paper to some extent. In general, the air-<br>
fuel ratio is correlated with torque. When the air-fuel ratio is<br><br>
low, namely, when the amount of fuel is large and the amount of<br>
air is small, the torque increases but the efficiency decreases.<br>
Whereas, when the air-fuel ratio is high, namely, when the amount<br>
of fuel is small and the amount of air is large, the torque<br>
decreases but the efficiency increases. The state where the air-<br>
fuel ratio is low is called "rich" and the state where the air-<br>
fuel ratio is high is called "lean". The leanest state is one<br>
often referred to as "stoichiometry", where the ideal air-fuel<br>
ratio at which complete combustion of gasoline takes place,<br>
namely, an air-fuel ratio of 14.7 is attained.<br>
The engine rotational speed is one of parameters indicating<br>
running conditions of the engine, and in general, a larger air-<br>
fuel ratio is employed at a higher end of the engine rotational<br>
speed, whereas a smaller air-fuel ratio is employed at a lower<br>
end of the engine rotational speed. This is intended to enhance<br>
the response characteristic of the engine torque at the lower end<br>
of the engine speed and to enhance the response characteristic<br>
of the engine speed at the higher end of the engine speed. In<br>
addition, the intake pressure is one of parameters indicating the<br>
loaded conditions of the engine such as the throttle position or<br>
opening, and in general, a smaller air-fuel ratio is employed<br>
when the engine load becomes heavy, that is, when the throttle<br>
opening is narrow and the intake pressure is high, whereas a<br>
larger air-fuel ratio is employed when the engine load is light,<br>
that is, when the throttle opening is wide and the intake<br>
pressure is low. This is because an emphasis is put on the<br>
torque with the heavy engine load, whereas an emphasis is put on<br>
the efficiency with the light engine load.<br>
As above, the target air-fuel ratio has a physical meaning<br>
easy to understand and thus can be set to some extent in<br><br>
accordance with required engine output characteristics. It is<br>
needless to say that the air-fuel ratio may be tuned in<br>
accordance with the output characteristics of an actual engine.<br><br>
The target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33 has a<br>
[transition correction part 29 for detecting transitions, more<br>
specifically, acceleration and deceleration of the engine from<br>
the intake pipe pressure signal and correcting the target air-<br>
fuel ratio. For example, as shown in Fig. 6, the change of the<br>
intake pipe pressure is also a result of an operation of the<br>
throttle, so that an increase of the intake pipe pressure<br>
indicates that the throttle is opened to accelerate the vehicle,<br>
namely, the engine is accelerating. When such an accelerating<br>
state is detected, the target air-fuel ratio is set to the rich<br>
side temporally and then returned to the original target value.<br>
As a method to return the air-fuel ratio to the original value,<br>
there may be employed any existing method, such as a method in<br>
which a weighing coefficient of a weighted mean of the air-fuel<br>
ratio set to the lean side and the original target air-fuel ratio<br>
is gradually changed. When a deceleration state is detected, the<br>
target air-fuel ratio may be set to the lean side than the<br>
original target air-fuel ratio to attain high efficiency.<br>
Note that an intake pressure detected at a predetermined<br>
crank timing substantially before the top dead center in a<br>
compression stroke was used in setting a target air-fuel ratio<br>
using the target air-fuel ratio calculating part 33. In this<br>
embodiment, as will be described later on, when detecting an<br>
atmospheric pressure, an intake pressure is used which is<br>
detected at a predetermined crank timing before the top dead<br>
center in an exhaust stroke, to be specific, immediately before<br>
an intake stroke or immediately before the intake valve opens.<br><br>
In addition, when detecting an injection fuel pressure, an intake<br>
pressure is used which is detected when the fuel injection time<br>
is over or is about to be over. Consequently, intake pressures<br>
need to be detected at least a plurality of times in the four<br>
strokes of intake, compression, expansion and exhaust strokes.<br>
Thus, by detecting intake pressures a plurality of times, as has<br>
been described previously, an acceleration demand by opening the<br>
throttle valve or a transition can be detected.<br>
The ambient pressure calculating part 41 calculates the<br>
ambient pressure based on the intake pipe pressure signal and the<br>
crank timing information. Fig. 7 is a graph of intake pipe<br>
pressure versus phase of the crankshaft, namely crank timing<br>
information. Each of the curves corresponds to the engine load<br>
at the time when the crank angle is -180°. For example, 45 kPa<br>
is the minimum engine load and 100 kPa is the maximum engine load.<br>
In Fig. 7, an intake stroke is started when tha crank angle is -<br>
360°. Immediately before the intake stroke, namely when the<br>
crank angle is near -360°, the intake pipe pressure is almost<br>
stable and is ambient as described later. In an engine without a<br>
supercharger, when the intake pipe pressure is stable, it is<br>
because the pressure is about ambient. Thus, in this embodiment,<br>
the intake pipe pressure immediately before the intake stroke,<br>
namely, immediately before the intake valve is opened is detected<br>
as the ambient pressure. However, as is clear from Fig. 7, when<br>
the engine load is large, the intake pipe pressure is relatively<br>
unstable. Thus, the ambient pressure is detected using an intake<br>
pipe pressure at the time when the engine load is small. The<br>
intake pipe pressure of 45 kPa at the time when the crank angle<br>
is -180° indicates that the engine is nearly idling. In this<br>
state, the intake pressure is also unstable. Thus, it is<br><br>
preferred that, the ambient pressure be detected using the intake<br>
pipe pressure at the time when the engine load is small except<br>
when the engine is idling.<br>
Fig. 8 is a graph showing the relation between the intake<br>
pipe pressure immediately before an intake stroke and the engine<br>
load with the engine rotational speed as a parameter, wherein the<br>
intake pipe pressure at the time when the crank angle is -180°,<br>
namely the engine load is plotted in the horizontal axis and the<br>
pressure immediately before an intake stroke is plotted in the<br>
vertical axis. As shown in Fig. 8, even if the engine load is<br>
the same, the intake pipe pressure immediately before an intake<br>
stroke can be different from the ambient pressure depending upon<br>
the engine rotational speed. Thus, to make it exact, the ambient<br>
pressure may be detected using the engine rotational speed as one<br>
of the parameters by, for example, a method in which the ambient<br>
pressure is detected from the intake pipe pressure immediately<br>
before an intake stroke only when the rotational speed has<br>
reached a predetermined value.<br>
The injection fuel pressure calculating part 42 calculates<br>
the injection fuel pressure, which is the difference between the<br>
fuel pressure and the pressure of the atmosphere into which the<br>
fuel is injected, based on the intake pipe pressure, the pump<br>
delivery pressure, and the ambient pressure calculated in the<br>
ambient pressure calculating part 41 and so on. Fig. 9 is a<br>
graph showing the relation among the fuel pressure, the intake<br>
pipe pressure as the atmosphere pressure, and the injection fuel<br>
pressure. In the case where the fuel pump 17 and the regulator<br>
16 is disposed in the vicinity of the fuel tank as in this<br>
embodiment, the pump back pressure and the regulator back<br>
pressure are both ambient (the fuel tank is not completely<br><br>
airtight). The pump delivery pressure and the regulator control<br>
pressure rise on top of the ambient pressure. When the pump<br>
delivery pressure is smaller than the regulator control pressure,<br>
the pump delivery pressure will be the fuel pressure. When the<br>
pump delivery pressure is the regulator control pressure or<br>
higher, the regulator control pressure will be the fuel pressure.<br>
After the calculation of the injection fuel pressure by the above<br>
comparison, the injection fuel pressure is calculated by<br>
subtracting the intake pipe pressure (the pressure of the<br>
atmosphere into which the fuel is injected) therefrom. In the<br>
case of a motorcycle, especially, since no surge tank is provided<br>
in the intake pipe, the intake pipe pressure varies greatly as<br>
shown in Fig. 9. Thus, in order to control the fuel injection<br>
amount by the fuel injection time as described later, the<br>
injection fuel pressure must be detected accurately. In this<br>
embodiment, the ambient pressure can be detected from the intake<br>
pipe pressure and the injection fuel pressure can be accurately<br>
detected from the pump delivery pressure and the intake pipe<br>
pressure, as mentioned above. Also, since no ambient pressure<br>
sensor is needed, the cost can be reduced for that. Note that as<br>
an intake pressure used when calculating the injection fuel<br>
pressure the intake pressure is used which was detected when the<br>
previous fuel injection time was over or was about to be over<br>
when implementing the operational process. This is because the<br>
amount of fuel injected from the injector 13 is most stable when<br>
the fuel injection time is over or is about to be over in the<br>
operational process due to the delay in response of the injector<br>
13, and as a result, the intake pressure in the time zone becomes<br>
most stable.<br>
Next, the fuel injection coefficient calculating part 43<br><br>
calculates a fuel injection coefficient for use in calculation of<br>
the fuel injection time based on the injection fuel pressure<br>
calculated in the injection fuel pressure calculating part 42.<br>
The flow velocity V1 of the fuel supplied to the injector 13 can<br>
be regarded as substantially 0, the equation (1) is established<br>
by Bernoulli"s theorem.<br>
P1= p • v22 / 2 + P2 (1)<br>
wherein p is the density of the fuel, P1 is the pressure of the<br>
fuel supplied to the injector 13, namely the fuel pressure, v2 is<br>
the flow velocity of the fuel injected from the injector into the<br>
intake pipe and P2 is the pressure of the atmosphere into which<br>
the fuel in injected, namely the intake pipe pressure.<br>
When the equation is solved for v2, the equation (2) is<br>
obtained:<br>
v2 = (2 (P1 - P2) / p )1/2 (2)<br>
Here, (P1 - P2) in the equation (2) is the injection fuel<br>
pressure calculated in the injection fuel pressure calculating<br>
part 42. Letting P = (P1 - P2) , the fuel mass M injected from the<br>
injector 13 per a unit time can be obtained from the equation<br>
(3) :<br>
M = S • v2 • ? = S • (2? " P)1/2 (3)<br>
wherein S is the cross-sectional area of the injection port of<br>
the injector 13.<br>
This indicates that the fuel mass M injected from the<br>
injector 13 per a unit time is in proportion to the square root<br>
of the injection fuel pressure P.<br>
Then, setting a reference injection fuel pressure Po and<br>
letting Qt0 be a. fuel injection coefficient (injection fuel flow<br>
rate characteristic coefficient) which gives a unit mass of fuel<br>
to be injected when the injection fuel pressure is the reference<br><br>
injection fuel pressure Po, the fuel injection coefficient<br>
(injection fuel flow rate characteristic coefficient) Qt which<br>
gives a unit mass of fuel to be injected when the injection fuel<br>
pressure is P is given by the following equation (4):<br>
Qt = Qto x (Po / P)1/2 (4)<br>
Thus, by multiplying the fuel injection amount by the fuel<br>
injection coefficient (injection fuel flow rate characteristic<br>
coefficient) Qt, the fuel injection time can obtained.<br>
Thus, the fuel injection time calculating part 44<br>
calculates the fuel injection time T by multiplying the fuel<br>
injection amount V calculated in the fuel injection amount<br>
calculating part 34 by the fuel injection coefficient (injection<br>
fuel flow rate characteristic coefficient) Qt. Namely, when<br>
letting the product of the injection fuel flow rate<br>
characteristic coefficient Qto obtained when the injection fuel<br>
pressure is the reference injection fuel pressure Po, the fuel<br>
injection amount V to attain a desired air-fuel ratio, and the<br>
square root Po1/2 of the reference injection fuel pressure be a<br>
preset value, the fuel injection time T calculated through the<br>
arithmetic process performed in the fuel injection time<br>
coefficient calculating part 43 and the fuel injection time<br>
calculating part 44 is a value obtained by dividing the preset<br>
value by the square root of the injection fuel pressure, namely<br>
P1/2.<br>
Then, the injection pulse output part 30 calculates a fuel<br>
injection initiating timing from crank timing information<br>
detected at the crank timing detecting part 27 and outputs to the<br>
injector 13 an injection pulse based on the fuel injection time<br>
calculated at the fuel injection time calculating part 44.<br>
Thus, according to the embodiment of the invention, by<br><br>
performing the detection of an intake pressure a plurality of<br>
times while the four-stroke engine completes the four strokes of<br>
intake, compression, expansion and exhaust strokes thereof, a<br>
change in intake pressure every time the strokes change can be<br>
detected to thereby detect a transition, thereby making it<br>
possible to have a target air-fuel ratio or to inject fuel<br>
according to the transition so detected. In addition, since an<br>
accurate injection fuel pressure is detected using at least one<br>
of the plurality of intake pressure values detected, to be<br>
specific, an intake pressure at the optimum timing for<br>
calculating a fuel injection time, that is, at the time when the<br>
fuel injection is over or is about to be over in the operational<br>
process so that an accurate fuel injection time can be set using<br>
the accurate injection fuel pressure so detected, fuel can be<br>
injected with an optimum injection initiating timing so as to<br>
improve the combustion efficiency.<br>
In this embodiment, as described above, the regulator 16 is<br>
placed in the vicinity of the fuel tank 19 together with the fuel<br>
pump 17, the difference between the pressure of fuel supplied to<br>
the injector 13 and the pressure of the atmosphere into which the<br>
fuel is injected, namely the intake pipe pressure, is detected as<br>
the injection fuel pressure, and, based on the square root of the<br>
thus detected injection fuel pressure, the fuel injection time<br>
during which the fuel is injected from the injector 13 is<br>
controlled. Thus, since neither integration of the injection<br>
fuel pressure nor a large number of maps are needed, the<br>
operation load can be reduced. Also, it is possible to reduce<br>
the number of parts and the costs by making the fuel pump 17 and<br>
the regulator 16 into an assembly.<br>
In addition, since the product of the fuel injection<br><br>
coefficient Qto resulting when the reference injection fuel<br>
pressure is Po, the fuel injection amount V required to attain<br>
the desired air-fuel ratio and the square root value Po1/2 of the<br>
reference injection fuel pressure value is set to the preset<br>
value and the fuel injection time T is calculated by dividing the<br>
preset value by the square root value P1/z of the injection fuel<br>
pressure value, the fuel injection time required to attain the<br>
desired air-fuel ratio can be calculated and set easily and<br>
accurately. Additionally, as a result, fuel can be injected with<br>
the optimum, fuel injection timing, whereby the combustion<br>
efficiency can be enhanced.<br>
Additionally, since the injection fuel pressure is<br>
calculated based on the intake pipe pressure as the pressure of<br>
the atmosphere into which the fuel is injected, the ambient<br>
pressure and the fuel pressure, it is possible to detect the<br>
injection fuel pressure accurately and easily. Also, since the<br>
ambient pressure is calculated from the pressure in the intake<br>
pipe of the engine, there is no need to provide an ambient<br>
pressure sensor, making it possible to reduce the number of parts<br>
and the costs. Additionally, since the intake pipe pressure<br>
immediately before the intake valve of the engine is opened is<br>
calculated as the ambient pressure, it is possible to detect the<br>
ambient pressure accurately in real time.<br>
Next, a second embodiment of a control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine according to the invention will be described. The<br>
description will be made by reference to Fig. 10. In this<br>
embodiment, in addition to the configuration of the first<br>
embodiment, an atmospheric pressure sensor 14 is added as an<br>
atmospheric pressure detecting unit. Thus, since, with the<br>
provision of the atmospheric pressure sensor 14 which can detect<br><br>
directly an atmospheric pressure, there is no need to calculate<br>
an atmospheric pressure from an intake pressure as is done in the<br>
first embodiment, an operational process that will be executed by<br>
the engine control unit 15 becomes what is shown in Fig. 11, in<br>
which the atmospheric pressure calculating part 41 provided in<br>
the first embodiment is removed and an atmospheric pressure<br>
signal detected by the atmospheric pressure sensor 14 is fetched<br>
to the injection fuel pressure calculating part 42. Where<br>
atmospheric pressures can be detected directly, as has been<br>
described above, the operational process of calculating an<br>
atmospheric pressure from an intake pressure can be omitted, and<br>
hence the operation load can be reduced by such an extent.<br>
Next, a third embodiment of a control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine according to the invention will be described. The<br>
description will be made by reference to Fig. 12. In this<br>
embodiment, the pump delivery pressure sensor 23 is removed from<br>
the configuration of the second embodiment. As has been<br>
described previously, unless the lower limit value of the pump<br>
delivery pressure becomes smaller than the regulator control<br>
pressure, the fuel pressure remains equal to the regulator<br>
control pressure.. In this embodiment, a pump having a sufficient<br>
delivery pressure is used for the fuel pump 17 so that the lower<br>
limit value of the pump delivery pressure does not lower below<br>
the regulator control pressure, whereby the fuel pressure is made<br>
to be constant relative to the regulator control pressure,<br>
thereby the pump delivery pressure sensor 23 being allowed to be<br>
removed. In the event that the pump delivery pressure sensor 23<br>
can be omitted as has just been described, the number of<br>
components involved and production costs can be reduced by such<br>
an extent. Note that an operational process that will be<br><br>
executed by the engine control unit 15 in this embodiment is what<br>
is shown in Fig. 13, in which the fuel injection pressure<br>
calculating part 42 calculates an injection fuel pressure using<br>
the regulator control pressure as the fuel pressure.<br>
Note that while the engine of the type in which fuel is<br>
injected into the intake port has been described in detail in the<br>
respective embodiments above, the control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine according to the invention can be applied to<br>
engines of a type in which fuel is injected into cylinders, or,<br>
so-called engines of a direct injection type.<br>
In addition, while the engine having four cylinders or the<br>
so-called multi-cylinder engine has been described in detail in<br>
the respective embodiments above, the control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine can be applied to a single-cylinder engine.<br>
Additionally, the engine control unit can be replaced by<br>
various types of operational circuits instead of the<br>
microcomputer.<br>
Moreover, while the pressure sensors which can detect<br>
pressures linearly are used to detect the various pressures in<br>
the respective embodiments above, a pressure switch adapted to be<br>
on and off at a predetermined pressure can also be combined to<br>
constitute the pressure detecting unit.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As has been described heretofore, according to the control<br>
device for a four-stroke engine of the first aspect of the<br>
invention, since the fuel injection device is controlled based on<br>
at least either of the atmospheric pressure and the fuel pressure,<br>
and the intake pressure, the injection fuel pressure required to<br>
control the fuel injection amount by the fuel injection time can<br><br>
be detected accurately and easily. In addition, since intake<br>
pressures are detected a plurality of times while the four-stroke<br>
engine completes its four strokes of intake, compression,<br>
expansion and exhaust strokes, a change in intake pressure<br>
resulting every time the strokes change can be detected so as to<br>
detect a transition, whereby fuel can be injected according to<br>
the transition so detected. Moreover, since a fuel injection<br>
time is calculated based on at least one of the plurality of<br>
intake pressure values so detected, whereby fuel is injected with<br>
an injection initiating timing according to the fuel injection<br>
time so calculated, an accurate fuel injection time can be set<br>
using an intake pressure detected at a timing which is optimum to<br>
calculate the fuel injection time, and as a result, fuel can be<br>
injected with the optimum injection initiating timing so as to<br>
enhance the combustion efficiency.<br>
In addition, according to the control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine of the second aspect of the invention, the pump and<br>
the regulator are disposed within the fuel tank so as to be part<br>
of the fuel tank assembly, whereby the number of components to be<br>
assembled individually and hence production costs can be reduced.<br>
Additionally, according to the control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine of the third aspect of the invention, since an<br>
intake pressure is detected at least when the fuel injection time<br>
so calculated is over or is about to be over, a steady intake<br>
pressure resulting substantially while fuel is being injected can<br>
be detected, whereby the fuel injection pressure can be detected<br>
more accurately and easily.<br>
Furthermore, according to the control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine of the fourth aspect of the invention, since the<br>
provision of only the pump delivery pressure detecting unit is<br><br>
made possible by adopting the configuration in which an<br>
atmospheric pressure is detected from an intake pressure, the<br>
necessity of the atmospheric pressure can be obviated, and the<br>
number of components involved and production costs can be<br>
attempted to be reduced by such an extent.<br>
Moreover, according to the control device for a four-stroke<br>
engine of the fifth aspect of the invention, since the provision<br>
of only the atmospheric pressure is made possible by adopting the<br>
configuration in which when the lower limit value of the pump<br>
delivery pressure is larger than the control pressure of the<br>
regulator, the fuel pressure is made to constitute the control<br>
pressure of the regulator, the necessity of the pump delivery<br>
pressure sensor is obviated, whereby the number of components<br>
involved and production costs can be attempted to be reduced by<br>
such an extent.<br>
In addition, according to the control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine of the sixth aspect of the invention, since an<br>
atmospheric pressure is detected from the detected intake<br>
pressure, there is no need to provide an atmospheric pressure<br>
sensor separately, whereby the number of components involved and<br>
production costs can be attempted to be reduced by such an extent.<br>
Additionally, according to the control device for a four-<br>
stroke engine of the seventh aspect of the invention, since at<br>
least an intake pressure resulting immediately before the intake<br>
valve opens is detected, atmospheric pressures can be detected in<br>
real time and accurately by calculating the intake pressure<br>
resulting immediately before the intake valve opens as an<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>
In addition, according to the control method for a four-<br>
stroke engine of the eighth aspect of the invention, since the<br><br>
fuel injection device is controlled based on at least either of<br>
the atmospheric pressure and the fuel pressure, and the intake<br>
pressure, the injection fuel pressure required to control the<br>
fuel injection amount by the fuel injection time can be detected<br>
accurately and easily. In addition, since intake pressures are<br>
detected a plurality of times while the four-stroke engine<br>
completes its four strokes of intake, compression, expansion and<br>
exhaust strokes, a change in intake pressure resulting every time<br>
the strokes change can be detected so as to detect a transition,<br>
whereby fuel can be injected according to the transition so<br>
detected. Moreover, since a fuel injection time is calculated<br>
based on at least one of the plurality of intake pressure values<br>
so detected, whereby fuel is injected with an injection<br>
initiating timing according to the fuel injection time so<br>
calculated, an accurate fuel injection time can be set using an<br>
intake pressure detected at a timing which is optimum to<br>
calculate the fuel injection time, and as a result, fuel can be<br>
injected with the optimum injection initiating timing so as to<br>
enhance the combustion efficiency.<br>

detecting an atmospheric pressure and a fuel pressure detected<br>
though the step of detecting a fuel pressure and an intake<br>
pressure detected through the step of detecting an intake<br>
pressure, wherein in the step of detecting an intake pressure,<br>
an intake pressure is detected a plurality of times while the<br>
four—stroke engine completes intake stroke, compression stroke,<br>
expansion stroke and exhaust stroke respectively and in the step<br>
of controlling the fuel injection, a fuel injection time is<br>
calculated based on at least one of a plurality of intake<br>
pressure values detected through the step of detecting an intake<br>
pressure so that the fuel is injected with an injection<br>
initiating timing according to the fuel injection time so<br>
regulated.<br>
A control for a four-stroke engine having an intake valve between a combustion chamber and an intake port and having at least one intake control valve for one intake port of the combustion chamber, the control device comprising a pump for pressurizing a fuel in a fuel tank, a regulator opened to an atmospheric pressure for regulating an upper limit value for the fuel pressurized by the pump, a fuel injection device for injecting the fuel regulated an upper limit value thereof by the regulator into the intake port, intake pressure detecting means for detecting an intake pressure betweent he intake control valve and the combustion chamber, at least one of a atmospheric pressure detecting means for detecting an atmospheric pressure and a pump delivery pressure detecting means for detecting the pressure of the fuel pressurized by the pump, and a fuel injection control means for controlling the fuel injection device based on at least one of an atmospheric pressure detected by the atmospheric pressure detecting means and a fuel pressure detected by the pump delivery pressure detecting means and an intake pressure detected by the intake pressure detecting means (24). The intake pressure detecting means is (24)configured to detect an intake pressure a plurality of times during completion of the intake stroke, compression stroke, expansion stroke and exhaust stroke respectively by the four-stroke engine (1) and in that the fuel injection means being enabled to calculate a fuel injection time based on at least one of a plurality of intake pressure values detected by the intake pressure detecting meaqns so as to inject the fuel with an injection initiating timing according to the fuel injection time so calculated.</td>
