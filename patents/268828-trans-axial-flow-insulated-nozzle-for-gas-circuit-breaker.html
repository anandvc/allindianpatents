				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to nozzle with bidirectional flow for current<br>
interruption in a gas circuit breaker, and more particularly to trans axial flow<br>
insulated nozzle for a moving piston puffer type gas circuit breaker.<br>
Background And Prior Art:<br>
Puffer type gas circuit breakers are employed to interrupt normal and short<br>
circuit current generated during fault conditions in a high voltage transmission<br>
system. In a puffer type gas circuit breaker with insulated nozzle, gas is stored in<br>
an enclosure at a predetermined high pressure and further compressed by<br>
cylinder piston action to a higher pressure in a compression chamber generally<br>
termed as a puffer or blast cylinder. The compressed gas from the blast cylinder<br>
is discharged through an insulated nozzle with a very high velocity to blow out<br>
the high temperature arc plasma that is struck between a pair of contacts. The<br>
arc surrounded by the envelope of high pressure gas eventually gets lengthened<br>
and quenched to interrupt the flow of current.<br><br>
Indian patent No. 217361dt.04/ll/2008 disclosed puffer type gas circuit breaker<br>
with movable piston and metallic blast cylinder in which the moving piston<br>
compresses gas within a fixed metallic blast cylinder as opposed to the then<br>
state of art circuit breakers, wherein a moving cylinder compresses the gas<br>
against a fixed piston.<br>
In the interrupter of the gas circuit breaker disclosed by the prior patent No.<br>
217361dt.04/l 1/2008, flow of the compressed gas from the blast cylinder<br>
through the insulating nozzle is unidirectional and axial in nature, thereby<br>
effecting the arc cooling and deionization process, thus limiting the current<br>
interrupting capability of the interrupter.<br>
Moreover, the thermal recovery process of the gas circuit breaker after current<br>
interruption is limited due to unidirectional flow.<br>
The trans axial flow insulated nozzle in accordance with the invention seeks to<br>
overcome the above drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
Objects Of The Invention:<br>
1. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a bidirectional (radial<br>
and axial) passage for gas flow within the arc quenching insulating<br>
nozzle during current interruption process.<br><br>
2.	Another object of the invention is to ensure flow of gas in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the arc length (trans-axial) in addition to the already<br>
existing axial direction.<br>
3.	A further object of the invention is to reduce the arc cross-section by<br>
introduction of a transverse or radial compressed gas flow through the<br>
insulating nozzle.<br>
4.	Yet another object of the invention is to improve the current interruption<br>
ability for an insulated nozzle puffer interrupter with movable piston and<br>
fixed metallic blast cylinder.<br>
Summary Of The Invention:-<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved blast interrupter of a puffer type<br>
gas circuit breaker interrupter, comprising a movable piston in a metallic blast<br>
cylinder for interrupting high electric current. An insulated nozzle with bi-<br>
directional (axial and transverse) compressed gas flow is provided to improve<br>
the interrupting capability of the gas circuit breaker interrupter.<br>
The transverse direction is also called radial direction in this specification.<br><br>
Brief Description Of The Accompanying Drawings:<br>
The proposed invention will be better understood from description with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 represents a puffer interrupter for gas circuit breaker with moving<br>
piston, metallic blast cylinder and insulating nozzle with unidirectional<br>
(axial only) gas flow according to the prior art.<br>
Figure 2 represents a puffer interrupter for gas circuit breaker with moving<br>
piston, metallic blast cylinder and insulating nozzle with bidirectional<br>
(axial and radial) gas flow according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 represents a detailed view of both axial and radial flows of the<br>
compressed gas with passages indicated for both flows in the<br>
insulating nozzle for the gas circuit breaker interrupter according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention as depicted in the accompanying<br>
drawings will now be described. However, there can be several other<br><br>
embodiments of the same invention, all of which are deemed covered by this<br>
description.<br>
As shown in the prior art interrupter for gas circuit breaker comprises in<br>
figure 1; an insulating chamber (1); a fixed contact system (2) a moving<br>
contact system (3); a fixed contact terminal (4); moving terminal (5); a fixed<br>
contact support (6); a normal current contact (7); a fixed arcing contact (8);<br>
a high voltage shield (9); a movable contact support (10); a metallic blast<br>
cylinder (11); a movable piston (12); an insulating nozzle (13); a moving<br>
arcing contact (14); a link to mechanism (15); and a movable contact tube<br>
(16). The isolating gap and the corresponding volume are represented<br>
respectively by the alphabets "A" and "B" in figure 1.<br>
Gas is stored at a high pressure in the insulating chamber (1), and the gas is<br>
further compressed to higher pressure inside the metallic blast chamber (11)<br>
and the movable piston (12) effects the gas compression. The insulating<br>
nozzle (13) blows the high pressure compressed gas over the high<br>
temperature arc that is struck between the pair of fixed (8) and moving (14)<br>
arcing contacts.<br>
The efficiency of a gas circuit breaker depends upon how quickly the high<br>
temperature arc can be extinguished or "blown out". The interrupting<br><br>
capacity of a circuit breaker, given in Amperes, goes up if the blow-out is<br>
achieved in shorter time.<br>
In the prior art, such circuit breakers, which blow out an arc with compressed<br>
gas, depended on unidirectional flow of the gas which was fed to the arc in<br>
the direction of the axis of the arc. Such axial flow of the gas did not effect<br>
reduction of the cross sectional area of the arc, which plays a vital role in the<br>
strength of the arc. An arc can be handled more easily and extinguished<br>
quicker, if the cross-sectional area of the arc can be reduced. The present<br>
invention achieves a reduction of the cross-sectional area of the arc by<br>
providing an additional trans-axial or radial gas flow. It therefore increases<br>
the short circuit current interruption capacity of such a circuit breaker.<br>
Figure (3) shows the detailed view of the radial and axial gas flow with<br>
passages effecting these flows. The constituent components of the<br>
interrupter are identical to that shown in figure (1). The improvement on the<br>
prior art of figure 1 is characterized by additional radial flow passages (17) in<br>
the insulating nozzle (13) to generate radial gas flow as shown in figures 2<br>
and 3 for faster cooling of the hot ionized gas developed due to the arc<br>
generated while opening of the interrupter during current interruption. Thus a<br>
radial passage for compressed gas flow within the arc quenching insulating<br>
nozzle is provided to convert the unidirectional gas flow to bidirectional flow<br><br>
(axial and radial) during the current interruption process and increases the<br>
compressed gas mass flow in the insulating nozzle (13). This additional radial<br>
flow assists in reduction of cross section of the arc and improvement in short<br>
circuit current interruption capacity from 25000 amps to 31000amps for the<br>
said interrupter.<br><br>
