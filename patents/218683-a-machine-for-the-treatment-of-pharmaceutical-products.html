A machina for the treatment of pharmaceutical products<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a machine for the treatment<br>
at products., in particular pharmaceutical products ,<br>
In particular, the invention relates to a coating machine<br>
used to apply a coating to pharmaceutical products, such as<br>
tablets or dapaules, to which the present specification refers but<br>
without thereby restricting the scope of the invention-<br>
Background Art<br>
At present, a conventional machine for coating<br>
pharmaceutical products comprises a hollow pan that revolves about<br>
a. horizontal axis and- is known in the txade by the term.<br>
"Pellegrini coating pan", which will herein be referred to simply<br>
as "coating pan".<br>
At the front of it, the coating pan has a central, circular<br>
opening through which the pharmaceutical products are fed into the<br>
pan from a reservoir, and a plurality of nozzles, mounted on an<br>
arm extending in a direction substantially parallel to the axis of<br>
rotation of the pan and designed to spray a coating, liquid towards<br>
and over a mass of pharmaceutical products to be treated, lying<br>
centrally inside the pan and. coming from, the reservoir through the<br>
central opening.<br>
At present, the inside walls of the coating pan are<br>
preferably equipped with a plurality, of inclined baffles<br>
protruding radially from, the walls theins elves. These baffles<br>
facilitate uniform distribution of the mass of products not only<br>
while the coating pan rotates clockwise about its axis as the<br>
products to be treated are fed into it but also while the coating<br>
pan rotaes in the apposite direction as the treated product is<br>
fed out of the coating pan into a container placed at the central<br>
opening beforehand.<br>
A major drawback in a coating machine of this kind is that<br>
the pan has a single opening for infeed of the untreated product<br><br>
WO 2004/069130	PCT/TB2004/000296<br>
2<br>
still to be treated, ae "well as for out feed of the treated<br>
product. This creates a potential risk of contamination between<br>
incoming and outgoing products, especially when there is a change<br>
to a different type of coating material,<br>
The present invention has for an object to provide a machine<br>
for treating pharmaceutical products that overcomes the above<br>
mentioned drawback-<br>
Another object of the present invention ia to provide a<br>
costing machine that mases the treatment of the pharmaceutical<br>
priducts as safe and rational as possible and that also permits<br>
zrapid cleaning and sterilising of the coating pan.<br>
Disclosure. of the invention<br>
The invention accordingly provides a machine for the<br>
treatment of pharmaceutical products, comprising- a pan that<br>
revolves- about an axis of rotation and a dispensing unit designed<br>
to disperse a coating material inside the pan ovet a mass of the<br>
products lopated in the pan-; the machine being characterised in<br>
that the pan has an opening for feeding the products to be treated<br>
into the pan, and an opening- for feeding the products already<br>
txestad with, the coating- nssterial out of ths pan, the infeed<br>
opening and the out feed opening being separate and independent of<br>
each other; a portion 6f the inside surface of the pan being<br>
equipped, with at least one helical flow regulating; fie designed to<br>
facilitate inflow of the products to be treated into the pan<br>
during the feeding of the products into the pan thirough the in feed<br>
opening when the pan itself revolves ia a first direction of<br>
rotation, and to cause outflow of -the treated products from the<br>
pan during the out feed, of the t rented products from the pan<br>
through the outfeed opening when tile pan itself revolves in a<br>
second direction of rotation,, opposite to the first direction of<br>
rotation.<br>
Description of the drawings<br>
The technical characteristics of the invention are clearly<br>
described in. the claims below and its advantages ate apparent from<br>
the detailed description which follows, with reference to the<br><br>
WO 2004/069130	PCT/TB2004/000296<br>
accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention. provided Merely by way of example without<br>
restricting the scope of the inventive concept, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view, partly in croas section and with<br>
some parts cut sway for clarity, of a preferred embodiment of the<br>
machine according to the invention for the treatment of products;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic front view of a detail from the<br>
mgehine of Figure 1;. and<br>
Figure 3 is a plane vertical section of the detail of Figure<br>
2.<br>
Detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the numeral 100 denotes in its<br>
entirety a machine for coating pharmaceutical products P, such as,<br>
for example, tablets or capsules.<br>
The machine 100 comprises a supporting frame 1, a pan 2<br>
mounted on the supporting frame 1 in such a way that it can be<br>
rotationally driven about an axis X by a customary motor, which is<br>
not illustrated, and a dispensing unit 3 which, during use, is<br>
positioned inside the pan 2 in order to dispense and disperse,<br>
preferably by spraying, a coating liquid over a mass M of products<br>
P located in a substantially central zone Z inside the pan 2.<br>
As illustrated in. Figures 1, 2 and 3, a substantially<br>
truncated cone shaped front portion X of the inside surface of the<br>
pan 2 is equipped with first, second, and third flow regulating<br>
fins 4, 5, and 6, which are preferably equally spaced and defined<br>
by cuspate profiles with triangular cross sections- whose base is<br>
joined smoothly to the inside surface of the fan 2, and which<br>
extend ia segusence along the truncated cone shaped portion of the<br>
inside surface in -a - substantially helical direction.<br>
During use, the first second and third flow regulating fins<br>
4, 5 and 6 are designed to facilitate inflow towards the zone Z of<br>
the pan 2 (in the direction indicated by the arrow F3 in Figures 2<br>
and 3) of the untreated product P fed through a first infeed<br>
opening or inlet 7 of the pan 2 while the pan 2 revolves abont the<br>
aids X in a first direction of rotation Fl  (clockwise in Figure<br>
2), and to cause outflow (in the direction indicated by the arrow<br><br>
WO 2004/069130	PCT/TB2004/000296<br>
4<br>
F4 in Figures 2 and 3) of the treated or coated product PT towards<br>
the outside of the pan 2, through an outreed opening or outlet B,<br>
located below the infeed opening 7 in. a position separate and.<br>
independent of the latter, while the pan 2 Itself revolves about<br>
the exis X in a- second direction of rotation F2 (anti-clockwise in<br>
Figure 2),   opposite to the £irst direction of rotation Fl.<br>
As shown in Figuce 1, the dispensing device 3 comprises a<br>
plurality of nozzlee 3u appropriately directed inside the pan 2 to<br>
cover the  zone 2,<br>
The nozzles 3u are mounted on a horizontal arm 3b,<br>
substantially parallel to the axis of rotation x of the pan 2 and.<br>
protruding- from the pan 2-<br>
Inside the arm 3b there are conduits for supplying the<br>
coating liquid, these conduits being connected to a feed tank (of<br>
customary type and therefore not illustrated) located outside the<br>
pan 2.<br>
As illustrated in mare detail ill Figures 2 and 3, the<br>
outfeed opening 8 has the shape of a ring made on a<br>
circumferential area of the pan Z and being, larger in diameter.<br>
than the circumferential area on whieh the infsied opening 7, also<br>
having the shape of a ring, is made, so that the infeed opening 7<br>
is. positioned above and to one side of the out feed opening 8.<br>
The out feed opening a is connected to a conduit 9, made<br>
Under the infeed opening 1 with respect to a horizontal plane of<br>
the coating machine 10D, on a protrusion 12 of the frame 1, and<br>
defines a tubular- channel through which the products PT from the<br>
outfeed opening 8 are conveyed to the outside.<br>
The tubular conduit 3 is equipped with a shutoff valve 14<br>
that seals  the outside end of the conduit  9 itself.<br>
Similarly, the infeed opening 7 comprises art access conduit<br>
11 made on the protrusion 12 and positioned above the conduit 9..<br>
the conduit 12 leads onto an inclined, surface 13 (Figure 3)<br>
that extends to an area cloee to the inside of the pan 2 and.<br>
partially covers the outfeed opening  8.<br>
The conduit 11 is also equipped with a shutoff valve 15 that<br>
seals the outside end of the conduit 11 itself.<br><br>
WO 2004/069130	PCT/TB2004/000296<br>
5<br>
Further, the two conduits II and 9 are connected to separate<br>
reservoirs 16- and 17 (shown schematically by the dashed lines in<br>
Figure l) for feeding "the- product to be treated F and collecting<br>
the treated product PT, respectively.<br>
As shown in more detail in Figure 2, close to the outfeed<br>
opening B there is a guide element 10 that is joined smoothly to<br>
the profile of each fin 4, 5 and 6, for feeding out the treated<br>
product PT.<br>
Preferably, there are- at least three guide elements ID<br>
separated- from each other by equal angular intervals. a and each<br>
consisting :ofa chute facing the outfeed opening B.<br>
More specifically, the three guide elements 10 are Separated<br>
from each other by ecual angular intervals  of apprximately<br>
1200.<br>
As- illustrated in Figure 3, the area adjacent to the treated<br>
product PT outfeed opening 8, close to the product P infeed area,<br>
is partly covered -by the inclined surface 13: this architecture<br>
keeps the openings 7 and 8 well isolated from each other during<br>
the steps of feeding in the product to he treated P and of feeding<br>
out the treated product PT, thus eliminating the risk of<br>
contamination between the incoming products F and the coated<br>
products PT feeding out of the pan 2 of the machine 100.<br>
The machine constructed as described above therefore<br>
achieves the aforementioned aims thanks to its ertxemely sinple<br>
structure, with a rapid production cycle made possible by two<br>
independent reservoirs, one for feeding the product in- and the<br>
other for collecting the treated product fed out,<br>
Moreover, the machine 100 can advantageously perform cyclee<br>
for cleaning or sterilising the inside surface of the pan while<br>
the pan itself continues to revolve- This is made possible by the<br>
fact that the conduits leading into and out of the pan can be<br>
sealed off and are totally independent of and separate from each<br>
othet. This saves considerable time between one production cycle<br>
and the next.<br>
Other advantages are derived from the constructional<br>
architecture of the fins, which have triangular cuspats profiles<br>
with smooth, counded edges which facilitate product flow and<br><br>
WO 2004/069130	PCT/TB2004/000296<br>
6<br>
prevent product accumulations or "shadow areas", that is to say,<br>
parts o£ the inside surface ot the pan where the coating liquid is<br>
not properly dispersed.<br>
It will he understood that the coating machine described, can<br>
be modified and adapted in several ways without thereby departing<br>
from the scope of the inventive concept. Moreover all the details<br>
of the machine may be substituted by technically equivalent<br>
elements.<br><br>
