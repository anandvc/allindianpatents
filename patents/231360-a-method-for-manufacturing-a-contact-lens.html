				<td>METHODS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TINTED CONTACT LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to methods useful in the production of tinted contact<br>
lenses. In particular, the invention provides a method in which diffusion of monomer<br>
into the colorant is aided by the heating of the molds used to produce the lenses.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of tinted contact lenses to alter the natural color of the iris is well<br>
known. Colorants used to produce tinted lenses generally are composed of a binding<br>
polymer and pigments. In one method of manufacturing tinted contact lenses, for<br>
examples as described and claimed in Attorney Docket No. VTN-571, United States<br>
Application Serial No. 10/027,579 incorporated in its entirety herein by reference,<br>
the colorant is applied to uncured lens material, that is subsequently cured, by<br>
transfer of the colorant from a mold surface to the lens material. A disadvantage of<br>
this method for producing tinted lenses is that the lens material may not diffuse<br>
adequately into the colorant prior to cure. This results in residual, unbound polymer<br>
becoming attached to the lens surface during the hydration step of processing of the<br>
cured lens<br>
In order to overcome this disadvantage, it is has been attempted to increase<br>
the cure time, thus allowing for a longer period for the diffusion to take place.<br>
However, this method is problematic in that it results in an increase in edge defects<br>
due to deformation of the lens mold. Thus, a need exits for a method to improve<br>
diffusion that does not adversely affect the resulting lens.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides a method, and lenses produced by that method, that<br>
reduces the residual, unbound polymer on the lens surface and lens surface<br>
roughness. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for manufacturing a<br><br>
contact lens comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of the steps of: a.)<br>
applying to at least a portion of a molding surface of a mold a tinting-effective<br>
amount of a colorant; b.) dispensing a lens-forming amount of a lens material into the<br>
mold; c.) heating rapidly the mold to at or above a glass transition temperature of the<br>
colorant; d.) diffusing the lens material into the colorant while maintaining the mold<br>
temperature at or above a glass transition temperature of the colorant; and e.) curing<br>
subsequently the lens material in the mold under conditions suitable to form the<br>
tinted contact lens. In another embodiment, the invention provides lenses produced<br>
according to this process.<br>
In a first step of the method of the invention, the colorant is applied to the<br>
molding surface of a thermoplastic optical mold, made from any suitable material<br>
including, without limitation, polypropylene resin, polystyrene resin, and the like and<br>
combinations thereof. For purposes of the invention, by "molding surface" is meant<br>
a mold surface used to form a surface of a lens.<br>
A tinting-effective amount of the colorant is applied to all or a portion of the<br>
molding surface of the mold. Typically, the colorant if applied to that portion of the<br>
surface that will be used to mold the portion of the lens that will overlay the lens<br>
wearer's iris. A "tinting-effective amount" of the colorant is an amount sufficient to<br>
impart the desired level of color to the lens to be produced. Generally, about 0.5 mg<br>
to about 4.0 mg of colorant is used per lens. The application may be carried out by<br>
any convenient means. Preferably, the application is carried out by pad printing.<br>
A lens-forming amount of a lens material then is dispensed into the mold. By<br>
"lens-forming amount" is meant an amount sufficient to produce a lens of the size<br>
and thickness desired. Typically, about 10 to about 75, preferably about 50 to about<br>
75 mg of lens material is used. By "lens material" is meant the monomer or<br>
monomers that, when cured, form the lens. The lens material may include any of a<br><br>
wide variety of additives including, without limitation, initiators, ultraviolet<br>
absorbers, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
The mold is then heated rapidly to facilitate the diffusion of the lens material<br>
into the colorant. It is a discovery of the invention that by rapidly heating the mold<br>
to a temperature at or above the glass transition temperature ("Tg") of the colorant,<br>
diffusion of the lens monomer mixture into the colorant is increased. However,<br>
heating must be not be so rapid so as to cause the deformation of the lens molds,<br>
which deformation will result in edge defects in the cured lens. Preferably, the mold<br>
is heated from about room temperature to the Tg in about 28 seconds, more<br>
preferably in about 10 seconds, and most preferably in about 4 seconds. The<br>
temperature is then maintained for a period of time prior to the initiation of lens<br>
material curing to permit diffusion to take place to the desired degree. Preferably,<br>
the diffusion is carried out for a time sufficient to swell the colorant to about 1 to<br>
about 4 times its dried thickness. The period of time during which the temperature of<br>
the mold is maintained at or above the Tg will depend upon the composition of the<br>
colorant and the lens material selected. Preferably, the period of time ranges from<br>
about 45 to about 75 seconds, more preferably about 65 to about 75 seconds, and<br>
most preferably about 65 to about 71 seconds.<br>
Rapidly heating the mold may be carried out by any convenient method<br>
including without limitation, infrared lamps, hot air, or any heating source capable of<br>
heating the mold to the desired temperature, but which does not initiate<br>
polymerization of the lens material. In a preferred method, a plurality of short wave<br>
IR. lamps having peak wavelengths of about 1 to about 2 microns are used to rapidly<br>
heat the molds. The lamps may be set at specific points along a tunnel through<br>
which the mold moves. The mold temperature is maintained while diffusion takes<br>
place. Maintenance of the mold temperature at or above the colorant Tg may be<br>
carried out by any convenient heating means. In the preferred embodiment, mold<br>
temperature is maintained by heating the air surrounding the mold. Thus, in the<br><br>
above-described embodiment, after first rapidly being heated to the colorant Tg, the<br>
molds move through a portion of the tunnel in which the air is heated, as for example<br>
by heaters.<br>
Subsequent to the diffusion of the lens material into the colorant, the lens<br>
material and colorant are cured under conditions suitable to form the tinted lens. The<br>
precise conditions for curing will depend upon the components of the colorant and<br>
lens material selected and are within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art to<br>
determine. In a preferred embodiment, a visible light cure is used at room air and at<br>
an elevated temperature of about 55 to about 70 ° C. In this embodiment, curing<br>
takes from about 75 to about 150 seconds. Once curing is completed, the lens is<br>
released from the mold and may be equilibrated in a buffered saline solution.<br>
Typically, the colorant used is composed of one or more pigments, one or<br>
more solvents, and a binding polymer. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a<br>
binding polymer is used that is capable of forming an interpenetrating polymer<br>
network with the lens material. Thus, in another embodiment, the invention<br>
provides a method for manufacturing a contact lens comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, and consisting of the steps of: a.) applying to at least a portion of a<br>
molding surface of a mold a timing-effective amount of a colorant, the colorant<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of: one or more pigments, one or<br>
more solvents and a binding polymer; b.) dispensing a lens-forming amount of a lens<br>
material into the mold; c.) heating rapidly the mold to a temperature that is at or<br>
above a glass transition temperature of the colorant; d.) diffusing the lens material<br>
into the colorant while maintaining the temperature; and e.) curing subsequently the<br>
lens material in the mold under conditions suitable to form the tinted contact lens,<br>
wherein the binding polymer and the lens material form an interpenetrating polymer<br>
network.<br>
i<br><br>
For purposes of the invention, "interpenetrating polymer network" or "JPN"<br>
is defined as the combination of two or more independent polymers in which one<br>
polymer is synthesized and/or cross-linked in the presence of the other. Thus, some<br>
degree of interpenetration occurs within the network structures. Typically, the<br>
independent polymers used to form the IPN are in network form. One type of IPN,<br>
specifically a semi-IPN, is composed of one or more polymers that are cross-linked<br>
and one or more polymers that are not substantially cross-linked as disclosed by<br>
"Interpenetrating Polymer Networks: An Overview" by Sperling,L.H. in<br>
Interpenetrating Polymer Networks, Edited by Klempner, Sperling, and Utracki, pp<br>
3-6(1994). For purposes of the invention, the type of interpenetrating polymer<br>
network used is a semi-IPN. In one embodiment, the semi-IPN is formed using a<br>
lens material, which is crosslinked and a binding polymer that is not substantially<br>
crosslinked. For the purposes of this invention not substantially crosslinked means<br>
that the non-crosslinked material is not subjected to conventional crosslinking<br>
conditions prior to contact with the lens material. Semi-IPNs may be formed in one<br>
step, or in a series of steps, which are known as sequential semi-IPNs. One of<br>
ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that, the presence of cross-linking agents,<br>
either through addition or as impurities, can create a reaction environment that favors<br>
the formation of a sequential interpenetrating polymer network.<br>
The binding polymers useful in the colorant are made from a homopolymer<br>
or copolymer, or combinations thereof, having similar solubility parameters to each<br>
other and the binding polymer has similar solubility parameters to the lens material.<br>
These binding polymers may contain functional groups that render the polymers and<br>
copolymers of the binding polymer capable of interactions with each other. The<br>
functional groups must be such that the groups of one polymer or copolymer interact<br>
with that of another in a manner that increases the density of the interactions helping<br>
to inhibit the mobility of and/or entrap the pigment particles. The interactions<br>
between the functional groups may be polar, dispersive, or of a charge transfer<br><br>
complex nature. The functional groups may be located on the polymer or copolymer<br>
backbones or be pendant from the backbones.<br>
For example, a monomer, or mixture of monomers, that form a polymer with<br>
a positive charge may be used in conjunction with a monomer or monomers that<br>
form a polymer with a negative charge to form the binding polymer. As a more<br>
specific example, methacrylic acid ("MAA") and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate<br>
("HEMA") may be used to provide a MAA/HEMA copolymer that is then mixed<br>
with a HEMA/3-(N, N-dimethyl) propyl acrylamide copolymer to form the binding<br>
polymer.<br>
As another example, the binding polymer may be composed of<br>
hydrophobically-modified monomers including, without limitation, amides and esters<br>
of the formula:<br><br>
wherein L may be -NH or oxygen, x may be a whole number from 2 to 24, R may be<br>
a Ci to C6 alkyl or hydrogen and preferably is methyl or hydrogen. Examples of<br>
such amides and esters include, without limitation, lauryl methacrylamide, and hexyl<br>
methacrylate As yet another example, polymers of aliphatic chain extended<br>
carbamates and ureas may be used to form the binding polymer.<br>
Preferred binding polymers are a random block copolymer of HEMA, MAA<br>
and lauryl methacrylate ("LMA"), a random block copolymer of HEMA and MAA<br>
or HEMA and LMA, or a homopolymer of HEMA. The weight percentages, based<br>
on the total weight of the binding polymer, of each component in these embodiments<br>
is about 93 to about 100 weight percent HEMA, about 0 to about 2 weight percent<br>
MAA, and about 0 to about 5 weight percent LMA.<br><br>
The molecular weight of the binding polymer must be such that it is<br>
somewhat soluble in the lens material and the lens material can diffuse into it.<br>
However, at the same time, the molecular weight of the binding polymer cannot be<br>
so high as to impact the quality of the printed image. Preferably, the molecular<br>
weight of the binding polymer is about 7,000 to about 100,000, more preferably<br>
about 7,000 to about 40,000, most preferably about 17,000 to about 35,000 Mpeak<br>
which corresponds to the molecular weight of the highest peak in the SEC analyses (<br><br>
For purposes of the invention, the molecular weight is determined using a gel<br>
permeation chromatograph with a 90° light scattering and refractive index detectors.<br>
Two columns of PW4000 and PW2500, a methanol-water eluent of 75/25 wt/wt<br>
adjusted to 50mM sodium chloride and a mixture of polyethylene glycol and<br>
polyethylene oxide molecules with well defined molecular weights ranging from<br>
325,000 to 194 are used.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that, by using chain transfer<br>
agents in the production of the binding polymer, by using large amounts of initiator,<br>
by using living polymerization, by selection of appropriate monomer and initiator<br>
concentrations, by selection of amounts and types of solvent, or combinations<br>
thereof, the desired binding polymer molecular weight may be obtained. Preferably,<br>
a chain transfer agent is used in conjunction with an initiator, or more preferably with<br>
an initiator and one or more solvents to achieve the desired molecular weight.<br>
Alternatively, small amounts of very high molecular weight binding polymer may be<br>
used in conjunction with large amounts of solvent to maintain a desired viscosity for<br>
the binding polymer. Preferably, the viscosity of the binding polymer will be about<br>
4,000 to about 15,000 centipoise at 23° C.<br><br>
Chain transfer agents useful in forming the binding polymers have chain<br>
transfer constants values of greater than about 0.01, preferably greater than about 7,<br>
and more preferably greater than about 25,000. Suitable such chain transfer agents<br>
are known and include, without limitation, aliphatic thiols of the formula R-SH<br>
wherein R is a Ci to C12 aliphatic, a benzyl, a cyclicalipahtic or CH3(CH2)x-SH<br>
wherein x is 1 to 24, benzene, n-butyl chloride, t-butyl chloride, n-butyl bromide, 2-<br>
mercapto ethanol, 1-dodecyl mercaptan, 2-chlorobutane, acetone, acetic acid,<br>
chloroform, butyl amine, triethylamine, di-n-butyl sulfide and disulfide, carbon<br>
tetrachloride and bromide, and the like, and combinations thereof. Generally, about<br>
0 to about 7 weight percent based on the total weight of polymer formulation will be<br>
used. Preferably dodecanethiol, decanethiol, octanethiol, or combinations thereof is<br>
used as the chain transfer agent.<br>
Any desirable initiators may be used including, without limitation, ultra-<br>
violet, visible light, thermal initiators and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, a thermal initiator is used, more preferably 2,2-azobis isobutyronitrile and<br>
2,2-azobis 2-methylbutyronitrile. The amount of initiator used will be about 0.1 to<br>
about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the formulation. Preferably, 2,2-<br>
azobis 2-methylbutyronitrile is used with dodecanethiol.<br>
The binding polymers of the invention may be made by any convenient<br>
polymerization process including, without limitation, radical chain polymerization,<br>
step polymerization, emulsion polymerization, ionic chain polymerization, ring<br>
opening, group transfer polymerization, atom transfer polymerization, and the like.<br>
Preferably, a thermal-initiated, free- radical polymerization is used. Conditions for<br>
carrying out the polymerization are within the knowledge of one ordinarily skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
Solvents useful in the production of the binding polymer are medium boiling<br>
solvents having boiling points between about 120 and 230 ° C. Selection of the<br><br>
solvent to be used will be based on the type of binding polymer to be produced and<br>
its molecular weight. Suitable solvents include, without limitation, diacetone<br>
alcohol, cyclohexanone, isopropyl lactate, 3-methoxy 1-butanol, l-ethoxy-2-<br>
propanol, and the like.<br>
Pigments useful with the binding polymer are those organic or inorganic<br>
pigments suitable for use in contact lenses, or combinations of such pigments. The<br>
opacity may be controlled by varying the concentration of the pigment and<br>
opacifying agent used, with higher amounts yielding greater opacity. Illustrative<br>
organic pigments include, without limitation, pthalocyanine blue, pthalocyanine<br>
green, carbazole violet, vat orange # 1, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Examples of useful inorganic pigments include, without limitation, iron oxide black,<br>
iron oxide brown, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, titanium dioxide, and the like,<br>
and combinations thereof. In addition to these pigments, soluble and non-soluble<br>
dyes may be used including, without limitation, dichlorotriazine and vinyl sulfone-<br>
based dyes. Useful dyes and pigments are commercially available.<br>
Coating, or wetting, of the pigment particles with binding polymer provides<br>
better dispersion of the pigment particles in the bulk binding polymer. The coating<br>
may be achieved by use of electrostatic, dispersive, or hydrogen bonding forces to<br>
cover the pigment's surface. Preferably, a high shear force is used to disperse the<br>
pigment into the binding polymer. The pigment may be added to the binding<br>
polymer by dispensing the polymer and pigment into a suitable mixer, such as a<br>
rotary shaft mixer and mixing until a homogeneous mixture results, typically for a<br>
period of up to about 30 minutes. The mixture may be then fed into a high shear<br>
mill, such as an Eiger mill to disperse the pigment into the binding polymer.<br>
Repeated milling is carried out as necessary to achieve complete dispersion.<br>
Generally, milling is carried out until the pigments are about 0.2 to about 3 microns<br>
in size. Milling may be carried out using any suitable, commercially available device<br>
including, without limitation, a high shear or ball milling device.<br><br>
In addition to the pigment and binding polymer, the preferred colorant of the<br>
invention contains one or more solvents that aid in coating of the colorant onto a<br>
surface. It is desirable, and preferred, that the colorant has a surface tension below<br>
about 27 mN/m. This surface tension may be achieved by treatment of the surface,<br>
for example a mold surface, to which the colorant will be applied. Surface<br>
treatments may be effected by methods known in the art, such as, but not limited to<br>
plasma and corona treatments. Alternatively, and preferably, the desired surface<br>
tension may be achieved by the choice of solvents used in the colorant.<br>
Thus, the solvents useful in the colorant of the invention are those solvents<br>
that are capable of increasing or decreasing the viscosity of the colorant and aiding in<br>
controlling the surface tension. Suitable solvents include, without limitation,<br>
cyclopentanones, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, l-methoxy-2-propanol, l-ethoxy-2-<br>
propanol, isopropyl lactate and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, 1-<br>
ethoxy-2-propanol and isopropyl lactate are used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least three different solvents are used in the<br>
colorant of the invention. The first two of these solvents, both medium boiling point<br>
solvents, are used in the production of the binding polymer. Although these solvents<br>
may be stripped from the binding polymer after its formation, it is preferred that they<br>
are retained. Preferably, the two solvents are l-ethoxy-2-propanol and isopropyl<br>
lactate. An additional low boiling solvent, meaning a solvent the boiling point of<br>
which is between about 75 and about 120° C, is used to decrease the viscosity of the<br>
colorant as desired. Suitable low boiling solvents include, without limitation, 2-<br>
propanol, l-methoxy-2-propanol, 1-propanol, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, 1-propanol is used.<br>
The specific amount of solvents used will depend on a number of factors. For<br>
example, the amount of solvents used in forming the binding polymer will depend<br>
upon the molecular weight of the binding polymer desired and the constituents, such<br><br>
as the monomers and copolymers, used in the binding polymer. The amount of low<br>
boiling solvent used will depend upon the viscosity and surface tension desired for<br>
the colorant. Further, if the colorant is to be applied to a mold and cured with a lens<br>
material, the amount of solvent used will depend upon the lens and mold materials<br>
used and whether the mold material has undergone any surface treatment to increase<br>
its wettability. Determination of the precise amount of solvent to be used is within<br>
the skill of one ordinarily skilled in the art. Generally, the total weight of the<br>
solvents used will be about 40 to about 75 weight percent of solvent will be used.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that each pigment used will<br>
have a critical pigment volume for the solvents selected. The critical pigment<br>
volume may be determined by any known means and, generally, is a volume based<br>
on the efficiency of a solvent and the binding polymer to suspend the pigment<br>
particles for example, as disclosed in Patton, Temple C, Paint Flow and Pigment<br>
Dispersion, 2d ed., pp 126-300 (1993).<br>
In addition to the solvents, a plasticizer may be and, preferably is, added to<br>
the colorant to reduce cracking during the drying of the colorant and optical mold<br>
parts, to enhance the final quality of the image produced using the colorant, and to<br>
enhance the diffusion and swelling of the colorant by the lens material. The type and<br>
amount of plasticizer used will depend on the molecular weight of the binding<br>
polymer used and, for colorants placed onto molds that are stored prior to use, the<br>
shelf-life stability desired. Useful plasticizers include, without limitation, glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 200,<br>
400, or 600, and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, glycerol is used.<br>
Amounts of plasticizer used generally will be 0 to about 10 weight percent based on<br>
the weight of the colorant.<br>
The opacity of the colorant may be controlled by varying the pigment<br>
concentration and the pigment particle size used. Alternatively, an opacifying agent<br><br>
may be used. Suitable opacifying agents, such as for example titanium dioxide or<br>
zinc oxide, are commercially available.<br>
In a preferred colorant mixture of the invention, about 0.2 to about 25 weight<br>
percent of pigment, about 30 to about 45 weight percent of binding polymer, about<br>
40 to about 70 weight percent of solvents, about 0 to about 25 weight percent of<br>
titanium dioxide, and about 0.2 to about 7 weight percent of plasticizer is used. The<br>
weight percentages are based on the total weight of the colorant mixture.<br>
The binding polymer may be loaded with about 0.2 to about 25 weight<br>
percent based on the weight of the colorant for organic pigments and about 0.2 to<br>
about 50 weight percent for inorganic pigments. However, high pigment<br>
concentrations may impart a very dark hue. Therefore, preferably about 0.2 to about<br>
7 weight percent of organic pigments and about 0 to about 20 weight percent of<br>
inorganic pigments are used. Combinations of pigments may be used in ratios<br>
dependent upon the color, shade, and hue desired.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that additives other than those<br>
discussed also may be included in the colorant composition of the invention.<br>
Suitable additives include, without limitation, additives that aid flow and leveling,<br>
additives for foam prevention, additives for rheology modification, and the like, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The colorant of the invention becomes embedded in the lens material upon<br>
curing of the material. Thus, the colorant may embed closer to the front or back<br>
surface of the lens formed depending on the surface of the mold to which the lens the<br>
colorant is applied. Additionally, one or more layers of colorant may be applied in<br>
any order. In yet another embodiment, a clear binding polymer layer may be used in<br>
conjunction with the colorant. For example, in the method of the invention a clear<br>
binding polymer layer may be applied to the molding surface of a mold half prior to<br><br>
application of the colorant. The clear binding polymer may be the same or different<br>
from the binding polymer used for the colorant layers. If the clear binding polymer<br>
is different from the binding polymer, it must be compatible with the binding<br>
polymer and lens material in terms of expansion factor and ability to swell and it<br>
must be capable of swelling into the lens material.<br>
The invention may be used to provide tinted hard or soft contact lenses made<br>
of any known lens material, or material suitable for manufacturing such lenses.<br>
Preferably, the lenses of the invention are soft contact lenses having water contents<br>
of about 0 to about 90 percent. More preferably, the lenses are made of monomers<br>
containing hydroxy groups, carboxyl groups, or both or be made from silicone-<br>
containing polymers, such as siloxanes, hydrogels, silicone hydrogels, and<br>
combinations thereof. Material useful for forming the lenses of the invention may be<br>
made by reacting blends of macromers, monomers, and combinations thereof along<br>
with additives such as polymerization initiators. Suitable materials include, without<br>
limitation, silicone hydrogels made from silicone macromers and hydrophilic<br>
monomers. Examples of such silicone macromers include, without limitation,<br>
polydimethylsiloxane methacrylated with pendant hydrophilic groups as described in<br>
United States Patents Nos. 4,259,467; 4,760,725 and 4-,261,875;<br>

Patents Nos. 4,136,250; 4,153,641; 4,189,546; 4,182,822;<br><br>
5,981,675; and 6,039,913; and combinations thereof. They may also be made using<br>
polysiloxane macromers incorporating hydrophilic monomers such as those<br>
described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,010,141; 5,057,578; 5,314,960; 5,371,147 and<br>
5,336,797; or macromers comprising polydimethylsiloxane blocks and polyether<br>
blocks such as those described in U.S. Patents Nos 4 871 785 and 5 03.4,461. All of<br>
the cited patents are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference.<br><br>
Suitable materials also may be made from combinations of oxyperm and<br>
ionoperm components such as is described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,760,100;<br>
5,776,999; 5,789,461; 5,807,94425,965,631 and 5,958,440. Hydrophilic monomers<br>
may be incorporated into such copolymers, including 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate<br>
("HEMA"), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, N,N-dimethylacrylamide ("DMA"), N-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone, 2-vinyl-4,4,-dimethyl-2-oxazolin-5-one, methacrylic acid, and 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylamide. Additional siloxane monomers may be incorporated<br>
such as tris(trimethylsiloxy)silylpropyl methacrylate, or the siloxane monomers<br>
described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,998,498; 3,808,178; 4,139,513; 5,070,215;<br>
5,710,302; 5,714,557 and 5,908,906. They may also include various toughening<br>
agents, UV blockers, and wetting agents. They can be made using diluents such as<br>
primary alcohols, or the secondary or tertiary alcohols described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,020,445. All of the cited patents are hereby incorporated in their entireties by<br>
reference.<br>
The materials for making the contact lenses are well known and<br>
commercially available. Preferably, the material used is a HEMA based hydrogel,<br>
more preferably etafilcon A, and the binding polymer is formed from linear random<br>
block copolymers of MAA, HEMA and lauryl methacrylate ("LMA"); linear random<br>
block copolymers of MAA and HEMA; linear random block copolymers of HEMA<br>
and LMA; or a HEMA homopolymer. Etafilcon A, disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,680,336 and 4,495,313 incorporated herein in their entireties by reference,<br>
generally is a formulation of 100 parts by weight ("pbw") HEMA, about 1.5 to about<br>
2.5 pbw MAA, approximately 0.3 to about 1.3 pbw ethylene glycol dimethacrylate,<br>
about 0.05 to about 1.5 pbw 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, and about<br>
0.017 to about 0.024 pbw of a visibility tint. Preferably etafilcon A is used with a<br>
linear random block copolymer of MAA, HEMA and LMA in a ratio of 0.47 MAA<br>
to 100 HEMA to 4.14 LMA, or with a linear random block copolymer of HEMA and<br>
MAA in a ratio of 99.9 HEMA and 0.1 MAA to 99.5 HEMA and 0.5 MAA.<br><br>
A preferred method of manufacturing a tinted lens is carried out using pad<br>
printing as follows. A metal plate, preferably made from steel and more preferably<br>
from stainless steel, is covered with a photo resist material that is capable of<br>
becoming water insoluble once cured. The pattern for the colorant is selected or<br>
designed and then reduced to the desired size using any of a number of techniques<br>
such as photographic techniques, placed over the metal plate, and the photo resist<br>
material is cured. Conditions for carrying out the pattern etching are within the<br>
knowledge of one ordinarily skilled in the art.<br>
Following the pattern, the plate is subsequently washed with an aqueous<br>
solution and the resulting image is etched into the plate to a suitable depth, for<br>
example about 20 microns. The colorant is then deposited onto the pattern to fill the<br>
depressions with colorant. A silicon pad of a suitable geometry and varying<br>
hardness, generally about 1 to about 10 Shore A durometer units, is pressed against<br>
the image on the plate to remove the colorant and the colorant is then dried slightly<br>
by evaporation of the solvent. The pad is then pressed against the molding surface of<br>
an optical mold and the colorant s allowed to dry. The mold is degassed for a<br>
minimum of about 8 hours to remove excess solvents and oxygen after which the<br>
mold is filled with lens forming amount of a lens material. A complementary mold<br>
half is then used to complete the mold assembly and, after a period of diffusion<br>
during which the lens monomer diffuses into the printed image, the mold assembly is<br>
exposed to conditions suitable to cure the lens material used.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by consideration of the following, non-<br>
limiting example.<br><br>
A colorant composition containing a binding polymer (lauryl methacrylate, 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid), pigments and isopropyl lactate, 1-<br>
ethoxy-2-propanol, and 1-propoanol, was pad printed onto the front curve molding<br>
surface of a polystyrene optical mold. The mold was degassed for at least 8 hours to<br>
remove excess solvents and oxygen after which the mold was filled with a lens-<br>
forming amount of etafilcon A. A complementary mold half was then used to<br>
complete the mold assembly.<br>
The mold assembly was placed onto a belt that passes through a cure tunnel,<br>
the inside of which tunnel was mounted 4 sets of 2, side-by-side, short wave IR<br>
lamps at the beginning of the tunnel. In this tunnel, the mold assembly passed under<br>
the IR bulbs and was heated to the Tg of the colorant. Control of the intensity of<br>
each bulb was maintained by a microprocessor-based temperature controller. The<br>
mold assembly then passed into a dark zone in which no bulbs were present, but in<br>
which heaters heated the air to between 55 and 75 o C to maintain the mold<br>
temperature at or above the colorant Tg. The mold passed through the IR bulb and<br>
dark zone of the tunnel at a speed so that it remained in this zone for about 75<br>
seconds during which time the Tg temperature was maintained by a continuous<br>
feedback system that monitored the mold temperature. The mold then exited this<br>
zone and curing of the lens material was initiated and completed. Once curing was<br>
completed, the lens was released from the mold and equilibrated in a buffered saline<br>
solution.<br><br>
