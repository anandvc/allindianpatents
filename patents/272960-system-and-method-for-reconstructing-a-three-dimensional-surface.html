				<td>Description<br>
System and method for reconstructing a three-dimensional<br>
surface<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for<br>
reconstructing a three-dimensional surface.<br>
The problem of reconstructing a three-dimensional surface can<br>
be solved by using a pair of cameras (for example, as<br>
disclosed in U.S Patent No. 6950121). The system described in<br>
U.S Patent No. 6950121 is fast but suffers from drawbacks in<br>
resolution for contrast starved regions and images where<br>
detecting feature points for registration becomes difficult.<br>
Also, such a system is prohibitively coarse for fine machine<br>
vision inspection purposes. Other systems following a similar<br>
philosophy have been used (for example, as disclosed in U.S<br>
Patent No. 7142281). Depth estimation can also be done using<br>
'Depth from Defocus' systems which also provide low<br>
resolution data. Also, there are studies comparing 'Depth<br>
from defocus' and stereo imaging and there is some ambiguity<br>
as to whether they are really different.<br>
The above problem has also been solved using high speed<br>
acquisition system and a triangulated laser beam. Various<br>
solutions have been implemented to address each issue at<br>
different levels of success. All prior-art. inspection systems<br>
require a high speed area scan camera and a laser. The laser<br>
line obtained from a beam shaper or triangulation using<br>
optical assemblies is made incident on the inspection surface<br>
(Downing et al, 5054918). A camera scans the laser profile as<br>
the object under inspection is made to pass under the<br>
incident laser line. The distortion in the laser pattern<br>
provides depth information which is subsequently converted to<br>
3D surface structure data.<br>
In a conventional system, a light sheet emitter emits a sheet<br>
of light, preferably laser triangulated beam on a three-<br>
 <br>
dimensional surface. The light sheet forms a projected curve<br>
which is read by the camera to form a curve in the image. The<br>
light sheet scans over the entire surface to obtain<br>
information which can be later compared for inspection<br>
purposes. The fundamental drawback with such a system is that<br>
it requires a huge acquisition time and transfers a large<br>
amount of unnecessary data for a mapping. Our system will<br>
circumvent such problems and simultaneously provide a device<br>
which is high speed, efficient (in terms of information<br>
transfer and processing) and cost effective.<br>
An adaptation of this technique is the digital fringe<br>
projection which involves projecting multiple fringes thereby<br>
reducing time of 3D data acquisition. However, technological<br>
impediments in fringe projection reduce phase measurement<br>
accuracy ('Digital fringe projection in 3D shape measurement:<br>
An error analysis' Notni, G.H: Conference "Optical<br>
Measurement Systems for Industrial Inspection" 2003 )<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
system and method for reconstructing a three-dimensional<br>
surface.<br>
The above object is achieved by a method according to claim 1<br>
and a system according to claim 4.<br>
The underlying idea of the present invention is to provide a<br>
system that will be able to capture 3D surface data as well<br>
as intensity of radiation beam at a high speed. The Line scan<br>
camera operates fast, hence iterations are performed quicker.<br>
In one embodiment, synthesizing said inverse curve for each<br>
strip of the three-dimensional surface further comprises:<br>
-	projecting a radiation beam having an initial beam profile<br>
on that strip,<br>
-	capturing an image of a projection of said beam on said<br>
strip by said line scan camera, and obtaining a resultant<br>
 <br>
profile from the image of the projection of said radiation<br>
beam on said strip, and<br>
-	iteratively modifying the beam profile of the radiation<br>
beam to arrive at said inverse curve that defines a final<br>
beam profile for said radiation beam for which the resultant<br>
profile obtained from said image of the projection of said<br>
radiation beam is a straight line, based upon a feedback<br>
relationship between the beam profile of the radiation beam<br>
and the resultant profile obtained from the image of the<br>
projection of the radiation beam on said strip.<br>
This involves mathematical computations that can<br>
advantageously be carried out with appropriate computer<br>
software.<br>
In a further embodiment, obtaining a resultant profile from<br>
the image of the projection of said radiation beam on said<br>
strip further comprises:<br>
-	obtaining an intermediate profile from the image of the<br>
projection of said radiation beam on said strip captured by<br>
said line scan camera, and<br>
-	spline fitting discontinuous portions of said intermediate<br>
profile to obtain a continuous resultant profile.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said dynamic beam projection means<br>
includes a programmable liquid crystal display (LCD)<br>
projector.<br>
In one embodiment, said radiation beam (20) comprises a laser<br>
beam. Using a laser beam is useful in inspection of<br>
irregularities dark surfaces having very little contrast in<br>
intensity.<br>
In another embodiment, said radiation beam (20) comprises an<br>
x-ray beam. An x-ray beam has lower wavelength and is useful<br>
in measuring surface irregularities of extremely small<br>
dimensions.<br>
 <br>
In one form of the present invention, the proposed system<br>
further comprises a rotatable mirror adapted for reflecting<br>
the projection of the radiation beam on a strip of said<br>
three-dimensional surface toward said line scan camera such<br>
that rotation of said rotatable mirror enables scanning of<br>
successive strips of said three-dimensional surface.<br>
The present invention is further described hereinafter with<br>
reference to illustrated embodiments shown in the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG 1 is a schematic diagram of a system for reconstructing a<br>
three-dimensional surface,<br>
FIG 2 is a schematic drawing illustrating successive<br>
deformations of the radiation beam profile and the<br>
corresponding resultant profile of the projection of the beam<br>
in the image captured by the line scan camera,<br>
FIG 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method for synthesizing<br>
inverse curves according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention,<br>
FIGS 4A, 4B and 4C respectively illustrate successive<br>
deformations of the radiation beam profile, the corresponding<br>
intermediate profiles of the projection of the beam as seen<br>
by a line scan cameras and resultant profiles after spline<br>
fitting of discontinuous portions in the intermediate<br>
profiles,<br>
FIG 5 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary arrangement of a<br>
rotatable mirror with a line scan camera for scanning the 3D<br>
surface,<br>
FIG 6 is a schematic drawing illustrating correspondence<br>
between points on the synthesized inverse curve and points on<br>
the straight line seen by the line scan camera, and<br>
 <br>
FIG 7A and 7B respectively illustrate a virtual straight line<br>
drawn on the inverse curves of successive strips and the<br>
corresponding depth curve.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide an efficient and<br>
low cost three-dimensional camera system for obtaining<br>
intensity as well as high resolution three-dimensional<br>
surface information at realistic times. The surface can be<br>
arbitrary, having no regularity constraints.<br>
The proposed system integrates a dynamic beam projection<br>
beams, for example a programmable liquid crystal display<br>
(LCD) projector or a digital light processing (DLP™)<br>
projector, a line scan camera, and an adaptive beam reshaping<br>
algorithm. Conventional systems project a straight light<br>
sheet, capture the profiles using area scan cameras and use<br>
them for 3D reconstruction. The drawback of such systems is<br>
the unnecessary time consumed for acquisition of the whole<br>
image and high data transfer rates. Such drawbacks decrease<br>
the speed of execution and increase the cost of the system or<br>
limit the resolution. The proposed system is conceptualized<br>
inverse to the above paradigm. The objective here is to<br>
synthesize a curve which on incident on a section of the 3D<br>
surface appears as a straight line when seen from the line<br>
scan camera. Once the line scan camera sees the straight<br>
line, the synthesized curve now represents information about<br>
the surface. This process is repeated for different strips on<br>
the surface and combined to form a representative shape<br>
descriptor for the particular surface. The purpose of the<br>
dynamic beam projection means is to iteratively structure the<br>
incident light in a feedback loop with the line scan camera.<br>
Referring to FIG 1, a system 10 is shown for reconstructing a<br>
three-dimensional surface 14, which may be any arbitrarily<br>
curved surface. The system 10 includes a line scan camera 30<br>
and dynamic beam projection means 12, for example a<br>
programmable LCD or DLP projector 16, which is coupled to a<br>
computing device 18 (for example, a PC) that executes the<br>
 <br>
algorithm for synthesizing inverse curves for each of<br>
successive strips of the three-dimensional surface 14. In<br>
operation, the projector 16 projects a radiation beam 20 (in<br>
this case, a light beam) on a strip of the surface 14. The<br>
surface 14 is a three-dimensional surface, and hence, if the<br>
radiation beam 20 has a beam profile 22 (i.e, beam cross-<br>
section) in the form of a straight line, the projection 26 of<br>
the beam 20 on the strip of the 3D surface 14 would appear as<br>
a curved line to the line scan camera 30. The idea of the<br>
present invention is to modify or re-shape the beam profile<br>
of the beam 20 by synthesizing an inverse curve, such that<br>
when a radiation beam having a beam profile in the form of<br>
this inverse curve is projected on that strip of the 3D<br>
surface 14, the projection 28 as seen from the position of<br>
the line scan camera 30 is a straight line. The synthesized<br>
inverse curve profile 34 is stored. Similarly, inverse curves<br>
are synthesized and stored for successive strips of the 3D<br>
surface 14.<br>
In operation, a radiation beam 20 having an initial beam<br>
profile is projected on to the strip from the projector 16.<br>
An image of the projection of the beam 20 is captured by the<br>
line scan camera 30, and a resultant profile obtained from<br>
the image of that projection as captured by the line scan<br>
camera. The beam profile of the radiation beam 20 is then<br>
iteratively modified using feedback based mechanism between<br>
the projector 16 and the line scan camera 30, which reshapes<br>
the projected radiation beam 20 from the projector 16 such<br>
that the image of the projection of the radiation beam as<br>
captured by the line scan camera has a resultant profile<br>
which is a straight line. The beam profile projected by the<br>
projector which gives a resultant profile (captured by the<br>
line scan camera) as a straight line is in the form of a<br>
curve which is referred to herein as an inverse curve for<br>
that particular strip of the 3D surface.<br>
FIG 2 shows the successive deformations of the beam profiles<br>
vky (x) projected by the projector and the corresponding<br>
 <br>
resultant profiles fky (x) obtained from the line scan camera<br>
for a particular strip of the 3D surface as the iterations<br>
progress. The arrow 40 indicates the direction of iterations.<br>
The iterations stop when the line scan camera sees a<br>
continuous and straight resultant profile 154. This deformed<br>
curve beam profile is stored as an inverse curve 152 for a<br>
particular strip of the 3D surface. The entire surface<br>
profiling is completed when all strips are traversed and<br>
their corresponding inverse curves are stored.<br>
It should be noted that the line scan camera would not be<br>
able to image complete profile of the projection of the<br>
radiation beam on a given strip of the 3D surface, and would<br>
see only a part of the profile. So, in the illustrated<br>
embodiment, an intermediate profile is obtained from the<br>
image of the projection of the beam as captured by the line<br>
scan camera, and then, discontinuous portions of this<br>
intermediate profile are spline fitted to obtain the<br>
resultant profile. This is explained referring to FIGS 4A, 4B<br>
and 4C. FIG 4A shows the deformation of the beam profile<br>
vky(x) along a direction of iteration indicated by the arrow<br>
40. FIG 4B shows the corresponding intermediate profiles 72<br>
from the images of the projection of the beam having the<br>
corresponding beam profiles as shown in FIG 4A. As can be<br>
seen, the intermediate profiles are discontinuous, since the<br>
line scan camera can capture only portions of the projection<br>
of the beam on a given strip of the 3D surface. FIG 4C shows<br>
the resultant profiles fky(x) obtained by spine fitting of<br>
discontinuous portions in the intermediate profiles shown in<br>
FIG 4B. The beam-reshaping algorithm is carried out based on<br>
a feedback relationship between the beam profile vky(x) shown<br>
in FIG 4A and the resultant profile fky(x) obtained from the<br>
line scan camera as shown in FIG 4C.<br>
FIG 3 is a flowchart showing an exemplary beam re-shaping<br>
algorithm 50 for synthesizing inverse curves for successive<br>
strips of the 3D surface. The algorithm 50 begins at block 52<br>
when a target strip is selected on the 3D surface. Let *y' be<br>
 <br>
a strip in consideration at a certain point of time. The<br>
strip at 'y' denotes the position along the scanning axis.<br>
For example, if the 3D surface is placed on a conveyor, as<br>
the object travels, the conveyor belt movement represents the<br>
scanning axis; as the machine part traverses, the 'y' value<br>
(or position) increments. The iteration carried for each 'y'<br>
is as follows. The iterative beam re-shaping algorithm is<br>
carried out as explained in FIG 2. The objective profile is<br>
what is sought after. In this case, the objective function is<br>
Φy(x) = h/2 , where 'h' is the height in pixels of the<br>
scanning area.<br>
At block 54, a radiation beam having an initial beam profile<br>
is projected on to the selected strip of the 3D surface. The<br>
initial beam profile is v°y (x), where 'x' runs along the line<br>
of pixels, represented by the line scan camera (for a<br>
standard line scan camera available, x would be a vector from<br>
1:640 or 1:1024). At block 56, a discontinuous intermediate<br>
profile of the projection of the beam on the surface is<br>
captured by the line scan camera. The resultant profile<br>
obtained after spline fitting discontinuous portions of the<br>
intermediate profile is f°y (x). This information is fed to<br>
the iterative beam re-shaping algorithm (block 58).<br>
In the iterative algorithm (block 58), the new profile to be<br>
fed to the projector is iterated by <br>
The profile v1y (x) when projected on to the 3D surface would<br>
give a resultant profile as f1y (x). This iteration is carried<br>
out for every time step 't' as generalized as<br>
  . The iterations are performed until<br>
the quantity is minimized. The parameter 'k' is<br>
a relaxation parameter enhancing the convergence rates and<br>
incorporates the mapping between the physical space and the<br>
image plane.<br>
Next, at block 60, the synthesized inverse curve<br>
corresponding to the beam profile vfinaly (x) is stored. At<br>
 <br>
block 62, the next adjacent strip of the 3D surface is<br>
selected as the target strip and the above steps (blocks 52<br>
to 60) are repeated. The algorithm 50 ends at block 64 by<br>
storing all the inverse curves that are synthesized.<br>
FIG 5 shows an exemplary embodiment illustrating the<br>
mechanics of the line scan camera 30. A rotating mirror<br>
(rotatable from position 106 to position 108) sweeps for a<br>
range of angles (represented by numerals 102 and 104) to<br>
enable vertical scan over a 3D test surface 14. The projector<br>
16 projects a radiation beam 20 at a particular designated<br>
strip which is the focus strip as deflected by the scanning<br>
mirror at any instant of time such that the line scan sensor<br>
30 is focused on the strip.<br>
In alternate embodiments, instead of light beams, other forms<br>
of radiation can be used. For example, the radiation beam may<br>
comprise laser beams. Using a laser beam is useful in<br>
inspection of irregularities dark surfaces having very little<br>
contrast in intensity. Still alternately, the radiation beam<br>
may comprise x-ray beams. X-ray beams have lower wavelength<br>
and is useful in measuring surface irregularities of<br>
extremely small dimensions.<br>
Referring back to FIG 1, the synthesized inverse curves are<br>
fed to the reconstruction means 32 to reconstruct the 3D<br>
surface. Herein, as shown in FIG 6, a correspondence is<br>
established between points on each inverse curve and points<br>
on the straight line of the resultant profile obtained from<br>
the line scan camera. As shown, the inverse curve 152 has<br>
points 160 in a regular fashion marked on it. The<br>
corresponding points on the straight line 154 seen by the<br>
line scan camera are noted; hence correspondences in points<br>
between the inverse curves 152 and the seen straight line 152<br>
are determined.<br>
For different strips along the 'y' direction, different<br>
inverse curves 152 and the corresponding straight lines 154<br>
 <br>
seen by the line scan camera are shown in FIG 7A and FIG 7B<br>
respectively. Herein, inverse curves 152 obtained from<br>
scanning different strips with the corresponding points in<br>
the straight lines 154 are shown<br>
The next task involves obtaining the actual depth map from<br>
the inverse curves. It is shown that drawing a virtual<br>
straight line 158 on the set of inverse curves 152 (shown in<br>
FIG 7A). establishes the depth curve 156 (shown in FIG 7B)<br>
using, the point correspondence information explained with<br>
respect to FIG 6. Depth curves 156 are obtained at various<br>
'y' strips and transformed geometrically to account for<br>
perspective projection. They are then stacked to form a true<br>
3D surface map.<br>
The present invention is advantageous in a number of ways.<br>
The proposed system will be able to capture 3D surface data<br>
as well as intensity of light at a high speed. The line scan<br>
camera operates fast, hence iterations are performed quicker.<br>
The system also provides high resolution 3D surface data. The<br>
LCD or DLP projector provides dynamic structured lighting and<br>
this can be used at the invisible spectrum of light without<br>
actually making the user uncomfortable (as in case of face<br>
detection, etc). Moreover, the proposed system uses simple<br>
components to achieve the said performance and is cost<br>
effective. Other systems using stereo cameras fail to provide<br>
dense structure information due to lack of feature point<br>
distribution; they fail in the case of ill-contrasted images.<br>
The proposed method ensures effective 3D reconstruction in<br>
all scenarios of shape, texture and intensity contrast. The<br>
proposed system may be used in innumerous applications like<br>
face recognition, surface inspection, embossment inspection<br>
for sorting, virtualization of 3D objects etc.<br>
Summarizing, the present invention provides a system and for<br>
reconstruction of a three-dimensional surface. The proposed<br>
system comprises a line scan camera and includes a dynamic<br>
beam projection means adapted for synthesizing an inverse<br>
 <br>
curve corresponding to each strip, of successive strips of<br>
said three-dimensional surface, such that when a radiation<br>
beam having a beam profile in the form of said inverse curve<br>
is projected by said dynamic beam projection means on said<br>
strip of said three-dimensional surface, the projection of<br>
the radiation beam appears as a straight line from the<br>
position of the line scan camera. The dynamic beam<br>
projections means thus obtains synthesized inverse curves for<br>
successive strips of said three-dimensional surface. The<br>
proposed system further includes reconstruction means adapted<br>
for generating a virtual straight line across said<br>
synthesized inverse curves and obtaining a depth curve based<br>
upon a correspondence between points on said inverse curve<br>
and said straight lines seen by said line scan camera. The<br>
reconstruction means then transforms depth curves obtained<br>
for successive strips of said three-dimensional surface<br>
perspective projections and stacks said transformed depth<br>
curves to obtain a three-dimensional surface map.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to<br>
specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be<br>
construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the<br>
disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of<br>
the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the<br>
art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is<br>
therefore contemplated that such modifications can be made<br>
without departing from the spirit or scope of the present<br>
invention as defined.<br>

The present invention provides a system and for<br>
reconstruction of a three-dimensional surface (14). The proposed system (10) comprises a line scan camera (30) and includes a dynamic beam projection means (12) adapted for<br>
synthesizing an inverse curve (152) corresponding to each strip, of successive strips of said three-dimensional surface<br>
(14), such that when a radiation beam (20) having a beam profile (34) in the form of said inverse curve (152) is projected by said dynamic beam projection means (12) on said<br>
strip of said three-dimensional surface (14), the projection (28) of the radiation beam (20) appears as a straight line<br>
from the position of said line scan camera (30). The dynamic beam projections means (12) thus obtains synthesized inverse<br>
curves (152) for successive strips of said three-dimensional surface (14). The proposed system (10) further includes reconstruction means (32) adapted for generating a virtual straight line (158) across said synthesized inverse curves<br>
(152) and obtaining a depth curve (156) based upon a correspondence between points on said inverse curve (152) and said straight lines (154) seen by said line scan camera (30).<br>
The reconstruction means (32) then transforms depth curves (156) obtained for successive strips of said three-dimensional surface (14) perspective projections and stacks<br>
said transformed depth curves (154) to obtain a three-dimensional surface map.</td>
