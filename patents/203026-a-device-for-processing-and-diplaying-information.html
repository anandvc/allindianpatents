COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A DEVICE FOR PROCESSING AND DISPLAYING INFORMATION<br>
     WELCOME REAL TIME of EUROPARC DE PICHAURY, 550, RUE PIERRE BERTHIER 13855 AIX-EN-PROVENC E CEDEX 3,  FRANCE a FRENCH     National Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
21-03-2005/16-08-2004<br><br><br>
DEVICE AND METHOD  FOR STORING AND DISPLAYING CODED INFORMATION STORED IN A SMART CARD<br>
The present invention relates to a device for 5 processing and displaying information obtained from coded data stored in a smart card, corresponding to op¬erations associated with at least one program for keep¬ing a user loyal to at least one trader, of the type comprising means for reading coded data from the memory 10 of the smart card, storage means with reading/writing of the data, calculating means and data-display means.<br>
It also relates to a method employing such a de¬vice.<br>
It finds a particularly important although not 15  exclusive application in the field of the verification of the content of the data stored in smart cards, espe¬cially of loyalty cards or of banker"s cards, which are presented at the moment of payment by a holder of the card to a trader, for example a" shop or supermarket, to 20  a service station, or to a motor-car dealership, in or¬der to obtain advantages which are defined as a func¬tion of the recency, of the frequency, or of the amount of the purchase made by the user of the card.<br>
Apparatus is already known which makes it possi-25   ble to display the number of points contained in a loy¬alty card on a smart card, or even on a payment termi-  nal or an electronic key ring.<br>
2<br><br>
However, such apparatus exhibits drawbacks.<br>
It does not  allow the consumer, the user of the<br>
card, to read the" coded information freely on different<br>
types of card.<br>
5	Neither does it offer the user a clear, compre-<br>
hensible and immediate view of the accumulated points and advantages present on the card, for each of the programs and/or the traders concerned.<br>
In other words, with such apparatus, it is not 10  possible to obtain and to display in real time all the information present on different types of cards used by different traders.<br>
The user is therefore obliged to remember his position for each of the programs, and/or to keep the 15  till receipts issued ducting the transactions,  which necessarily entails errors and omissions.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a device and a method responding better than those known hith¬erto to the requirements of actual practice, especially 20 in that it makes it possible to read from a smart card and to display in real time, and in a uniform graphics form, on the one hand the contents of the various elec¬tronic loyalty programs issued by several traders, and, on the other hand, the position, at a given date, of 25 the carrier of the smart card for each of these differ¬ent programs.<br>
3<br><br>
With the invention, the consumer has access to the information with a user-friendly display system which is simple to understand, based, for example, on a scale, with graduations, a unit of measurement and an 5 associated qualitative state.         Furthermore, a single hardware device is re-quired to gain access in real time to all- the informa-tion stored on several different types of cards, relat-ing to different loyalty programs.<br>
10	The consumer no longer has to remember his posi-<br>
tion in each program or else to store paper tickets. As to the trader, he inherits all the advantages of the known systems of the prior art, while increasing his chances of keeping the consumer loyal.<br>
15	To that end, the .invention especially proposes a<br>
device for processing and displaying information ob-tained from coded data stored in a smart card, corre-sponding to operations associated with at least one program for  keeping  a  user  loyal  to  at  least  one<br>
20 trader, the device comprising means for reading coded data from the memory of the smart card, storage means with reading/writing of data, calculating means and data-display means, characterized in that, with the memory of the smart card including several data regis-<br>
25 ters respectively allocated to several different trad-ers and/or corresponding to several loyalty programs, said registers comprising files, called Behavior files,<br>
4<br><br>
relating to the behavior of the holder of the card with the trader or traders concerned, the calculating means include means for formatting data output from the reg¬isters in a uniform way, the display means being con-5  figured to display, also in a uniform way, said infor¬mation corresponding to said data thus formatted, and in that it further includes means for navigation through the stored data by a user of the device in or¬der to obtain the display of said information.<br>
10	Navigation means should be understood as meaning<br>
any touch or vocal means, for example a keyboard, a touch screen, a speech-recognition system, an infra-red remote control, etc.<br>
In advantageous embodiments,  recourse is had,<br>
15  moreover, to one and/or Other of the following arrange¬ments :<br>
-	the means for formatting the data and for dis¬<br>
playing the coded information in a uniform way comprise<br>
means for displaying a graduated scale;<br>
20	- the means for displaying a graduated scale in¬<br>
clude means for calculating and interpreting data<br>
stored in the card so as to update them dynamically as<br>
a function of the data corresponding to at least one<br>
 loyalty program, said calculating means being config-<br>
25  ured to:<br>
-	calculate for said program the number of in¬<br>
tervals corresponding to the scale as a func-<br>
5<br><br>
tion of a predetermined unit of measurement of said program,<br>
-	calculate the constant size of each interval,<br>
-	display the end points of said scale and a<br>
5            state,  called qualitative state,  associated<br>
beforehand with said scale,<br>
-	calculate the distance between two graduations<br>
of the scale corresponding to an interval,<br>
-	calculate the level of the scale as a function 0           of the data from the behavior files,<br>
-	and display said scale level.<br>
-	the navigation means comprise a touch screen;<br>
-	the device is a portable telephone;<br>
-	the device is a satellite decoder;<br>
5	- the device is a personal digital assistant,<br>
for example of the type sold by the American company US Robotics known by the name of Palm Pilot;<br>
-	the device includes:<br>
-	means for inputting the data of the coded<br>
0	information stored in the smart card into<br>
an intermediate storage memory and for displaying information obtained from said data,<br>
-	means for storing coded data corresponding<br>
5	to one or more programs for keeping a user<br>
loyal to several traders,<br>
6<br><br>
- means for comparison between the data in¬<br>
put into said intermediate memory and data<br>
stored in said information-storage means,<br>
and<br>
5	- means for processing the results of these<br>
comparisons in order to display updated<br>
information.<br>
The invention also proposes a method for employ¬<br>
ing the device described above.<br>
10	The invention will be better understood on read-<br>
ing the description which follows of embodiments given by way of nonlimiting example. The description makes reference to the drawings which accompany it, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows an overall diagram of a device<br>
15  according to one embodiment Of the invention.<br>
-	Figure 2 is a general flowchart showing one<br>
embodiment of the processing method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
-	Figure 3 shows an example application of a de-<br>
20  vice according to one embodiment of the invention with<br>
a touch screen.<br>
-	Figure 4 is an example screen showing the dis¬<br>
play of a scale with the device of Figure 3.<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagram of a device 1 allowing 25   the carrier of a multi-application card 2 to view, in a uniform way, the content of different loyalty programs.<br>
7<br><br>
A loyalty program is a program containing rules for issuing, the types of bonuses and the messages as¬sociated with promotional programs, which is stored on an electronic card or in an electronic-points counter.<br>
5	It employs loyalty mechanisms, such as the cal-<br>
culation of the recency of the visits, of the frequency of visits or of the amount of the purchases made by a consumer, for example, or a combination of these mecha¬nisms .<br>
10	The multi-application card 2 is of smart-card<br>
type, manufactured, for example, by the French company Schlumberger.<br>
The hardware device 1 ds, for example, an en¬hanced portable telephone, a satellite decoder with a<br>
15 card reader, a personal digital assistant or "organizer". That may also be a payment terminal, a personal computer with a card reader, an electronic ki¬osk, an interactive terminal such as a ticket dis¬penser, etc.<br>
20	The essential thing is that it can be programma-<br>
ble in order to carry out the functions of storage of information and of display of data stored on the card of the user.<br>
The device comprises a set of software modules<br>
25 carrying out the functions of reading and interpreting the data corresponding to loyalty information contained in the card and for distributing information inter-<br>
8<br><br>
preted for viewing, in a uniform way, incorporating a scale, graduations," a unit of measurement and an asso¬ciated qualitative state.<br>
More precisely, the device 1 comprises means 3 5  for reading the card 2 with a chip 4 which are con¬nected to a read/write interface circuit 5 which is in itself known, interpreter means 6, converting the data read by the reader into a uniform presentation which will then be processed by a main application module 7 10  interfaced with a navigation and display interface mod¬ule 8 .<br>
The interpreter means 6, and the modules 7 and<br>
8,	are configured to allow presentation and displaying,<br>
graphically in a uniform way, and in an identical way<br>
15 as far as navigation by^"the user in the various pro¬grams and for the various traders is concerned. These means are, for example, microprocessors programd by an algorithm described in more detail by reference to Fig¬ure 2 .<br>
20	The module 8 is connected to the display means<br>
9,	for example an LCD screen, which may be a touch<br>
screen, the navigation means 10 then being incorporated<br>
into the display means.<br>
In the embodiment more particularly described 25   here, the device 1 is configured to communicate updated information, via a protocol interface 11 and a communi¬cations module 12  (modem) with a server 13,  situated<br>
9<br><br>
remotely,  (of  PC  or microcomputer,  etc.  type)  and equipped with the necessary software.<br>
It is known that the loyalty programs are dif¬ferent as regards the objectives to be achieved,  a 5  chain of restaurants not having the same objectives or the same constraints as a chain of supermarkets, as a furniture retailer or as a network of cinemas.<br>
Likewise, the loyalty techniques used to meet<br>
these objectives are different.<br>
10	They may be.based on an accumulation of loyalty<br>
points, on a count of the number of visits, on an accu¬mulation of proofs of purchase, etc.<br>
Equally, the mechanism used will be different. For example, the acquisition of loyalty advantages may 15 be based on fixed or proportional rules such as the frequency of visits, the amount of purchases, the re¬cency between two visits, or a combination of several of these factors.<br>
Finally the rules for issuing and for the con-20  tent of the programs will vary infinitely, such as, for example:<br>
-	"1 point for 10 FF spent",<br>
-	"A bonus of 20 points as • from 200 FF of pur¬chases" ,<br>
25	- "Offer of a meal for 450 FF of purchases"<br>
-	"Offer of a meal for 450 FF spent during the<br>
month",<br>
10<br><br>
-	Offer of a coffee if you come back within 10<br>
days",<br>
-	"10% reduction on all the purchases you have<br>
made during your last 10 visits".<br>
5   The organization of the data files and the meth¬ods making it possible to carry out processing and dis¬play in a uniform way according to the invention will now be described.<br>
Description of the files contained on the card:<br>
10	In the embodiment more particularly described<br>
here, and in such a way as to allow this processing and this display in a uniform way, the information con¬tained in the card is distributed into " 4 different files:<br>
15	- the Card file this contains the information<br>
for describing the card, and especially:<br>
-	the number of the card,<br>
-	the name of the card (or an identifier<br>
making it possible to recover it),<br>
20	- the- expiry date,<br>
-	the Carrier file: this groups together infor¬<br>
mation describing the carrier of the card, such as:<br>
-	the name of the carrier,<br>
-	a number for identifying the carrier (such 25                as a bank identification number),<br>
-	demographic information, such as the date<br>
of birth, his address, etc.,<br>
11<br><br>
- biometric information, such as the height of the carrier, etc.<br>
-	the Points file: this stores the accumulated<br>
total of loyalty points acquired by the card carrier<br>
5  with one or more traders,<br>
-	the RFM file: this stores the history of the<br>
purchasing behavior for each of the traders frequented<br>
by the card carrier. It is structured into records,<br>
each record containing the information specific to the<br>
10  loyalty program(s). of a trader (or of several when the loyalty program is common to several traders). Each record contains:<br>
-	a number for identifying the loyalty program,<br>
the type of  loyalty program run by this<br>
15	trader,         <br>
-	the date of expiry of the loyalty program,<br>
the date of the. last visit made to this trader,<br>
-	the number of visits made to this trader,<br>
20	- the accumulated amount of the purchases made<br>
from this trader. Figure 2 shows a general processing flowchart for the uniform formatting of the information, its uni-"form display and easy navigation by a user allowing him 25  to obtain the information sought.<br>
At 14, the user inserts a smart card 2 into the device 1, the validity of which is tested at 13.<br>
12<br><br>
If the card is valid, the detector device reads<br>
the carrier file  (stage 14),  searches at 15 for the<br>
name of the carrier, displays it at 16, then reads the<br>
card file (stage 17) . If no carrier name is found, the<br>
5  test 15 makes it possible to access stage 17 directly.<br>
Next, the existence of a bank identifier or name   is tested at .18. If it is found, the name of the bank is displayed at 19.<br>
The reading of the RFM file is then carried out 10   (stage 20) either via the display stage 19, or directly in the case in which no bank is identified following the test 18.<br>
If the parameters sought are present (stage 21), the LCD screen displays the list at 22, namely and es-15  pecially the name of the ,Trader, his logo, his address, the validity date, etc.<br>
In the event that the parameters sought are not present, an interrogation (stage 23) of a server en¬tirely situated remotely is, for example and if appro-20  priate, carried out.<br>
Once the display has been produced, the loyalty program to be viewed is selected (stage 24).<br>
This selection stage is followed by a stage (25) for searching for the parameters of the loyalty pro-25  gram.<br>
If these parameters are present or identified (test 26), there is a display (stage 27, see below) of<br><br><br>
the type of program and of the units of measurement al¬lowing the uniform presentation of these parameters.<br>
Display of loyalty program (stage 27)<br>
Display scale and indicate the unit of measure-5  ment of the program (# of visits or accumulated amount of purchases);<br>
place  the  explicit  graduation  marks  on  the scale, according to their values;<br>
beside each graduation mark, place the legend 10  corresponding to the qualitative state associated with the graduation mark;<br>
fill in the scale according to the # of visits<br>
or accumulated amount recorded in the card of the car¬<br>
rier .<br>
15	If the parameters are not present, an interroga-<br>
tion, at 28, of a remote server is, for example and if appropriate, carried out.<br>
The display of the program is then followed by a stage 29 of calculation of the number of intervals and 20  of the size of each of these intervals, then of a dis¬play at 30 of the end points and of the associated qualitative state.<br>
Then a calculation of the size of the scale and its display according to the invention are carried out 25  at 31.<br>
14<br><br>
The return to the menu (stage 32) before a test 33 in order to continue the visual display is then car¬ried out.<br>
If the user decides not to quit, he then comes 5 back (link 34) to the stage 24 of selection of the loy¬alty program described above.<br>
The content of the stages of the embodiment of the invention more particularly described here will now be detailed, showing the algorithm for updating and 10  displaying the information in a dynamic way.<br>
A.	Search for and display of the general infor¬<br>
mation (stages 14 to 19) :<br>
-	reading of the carrier file from the card:<br>
name of the carrier<br>
15	- reading of the card file: name (or identifier<br>
of the bank<br>
-	date and time, etc.<br>
B.	Search by reading of the RFM file of the card<br>
or of the loyalty programs present in the card (stages<br>
20   20 to 23) :<br>
The RFM file is structured into records which contain the information specific to each loyalty pro¬gram present in said RFM file of the card of the car¬rier. Each record is characterized by an identification 25   number.<br>
For each of the programs identified:<br>
15<br><br>
1.	Search for the general information of the<br>
loyalty program (interrogation of the remote server, if<br>
necessary):<br>
-	name of the chain 5           - address<br>
-	date of validity of the program<br>
-	graphical logo of the trader, etc.<br>
2.	Display of the list of the loyalty programs<br>
and of the general information specific to each of<br>
0  them.<br>
C. Selection of a program and display (stages 24 to 31)<br>
1. Search for the parameters of the loyalty pro¬<br>
gram (interrogation of the remote server if necessary):<br>
5	-  type  of  the . program  (frequency,  amount,<br>
points, etc.)<br>
-	units of measurement (number of visits, FF,<br>
number of points, etc.)<br>
-	number of scenarios<br>
20	- end points of each of these scenarios<br>
-	qualitative state on each of the scenarios<br>
(example: wording of message or coupon) etc.<br>
giving, for example, a state of the type:<br>
-	Graduation 1: value and qualitative state, 25          - Graduation 2: value and qualitative state,<br>
-	Graduation 3: value and qualitative state,<br>
-	Graduation 4: value and qualitative state.<br>
16<br><br>
2. Display of the scale and of the parameters.<br>
A representation in pseudocode is given below,<br>
for example, for a loyalty program based on    the fre¬<br>
quency of the visits:<br>
5	- let   lower   end  point    (i)    be   the   value   of   the<br>
lower end point  of the  scenario   (i)<br>
-	let   upper end point (i)    be   the   value   of   the<br>
upper end point  of the  scenario   (i)<br>
-	associated  qualitative   state    (i) ,    the  message<br>
0  relating  to   the  implementation  of  the  scenario   (i)<br>
graduation size (i) , the size between two graduations over the interval corresponding to the sce¬nario   (i)<br>
-	Calculation of the number of intervals:<br>
5          Start	<br>
If lower  end point   (1)   =  0<br>
then  number of intervals  ~ number  of scenar¬ios<br>
otherwise    number    of    intervals    -    number    of<br>
0	scenarios  +  1<br>
Endif End<br>
-	Calculation of the constant size of each in¬<br>
terval :<br>
5	Size   of   each   interval   =   total   size   /   number   of<br>
intervals<br>
17<br><br>
-	Display of the end points and of the associ¬<br>
ated qualitative state (two cases depending on whether<br>
the first lower end point is equal to zero or not):<br>
Start<br>
5	If lower end point   (1)   =  0<br>
Then<br>
for i  =  1   to number of scenarios<br>
display lower end point  of scenarios   (i)<br>
display associated  qualitative  state   (i)<br>
10	End for<br>
Otherwise<br>
lower end point  of scenario   (0)   = 0<br>
associated qualitative  state   (0)   =  empty<br>
for i  =  0  to number of scenarios<br>
15	display   qualitative    state    of   scenarios<br>
(i)<br>
display associated qualitative  state   (i)<br>
end for<br>
End if<br>
20	End<br>
-	Calculation of the size between two gradua¬<br>
tions over each interval:<br>
Start<br>
If lower  end point    (1)   =   0<br>
25	Then<br>
lower  end point    (number  of  scenarios   +   1)   = upper  end point   (number  of scenarios)<br>
18<br><br>
for  i  =  1   to number  of scenarios<br>
graduation   size    (i)    =   size   of   each    in¬<br>
terval    /     (lower    end   point     (i    +    1)<br>
lower end point   (i))<br>
5	end for<br>
Otherwise<br>
lower  end point   (0)   = 0<br>

The description of the parameters contained in 5  the terminal is, moreover, as follows, for example. Campaign parameters:<br>
-	identification number of the loyalty program<br>
-	name of the loyalty program<br>
-	validity  of  the  program:  daily,  weekly, 10	monthly, bounded (from date to date), annual,<br>
infinite<br>
-	type of program: frequency, amount, recency<br>
-	frequency accepted: all the visits are taken<br>
r<br>
into account or one visit per day only<br>
15	- rules for issuing the advantages, presented in<br>
the form of bonus scenarios including: mini¬mum and maximum end points for activating the scenario, loyalty bonuses. Advantageously, the graduated scale includes an 20  associated qualitative state updated dynamically,  re¬sulting from a calculation and from an interpretation of the information contained on the card compared with the descriptive information on the loyalty program of the trader, the calculating rules playing a part in the 25  construction of the scale being:<br>
1. Calculation of the number of intervals<br>
20<br><br>
rules relating to the amount of the purchases made up to a cut-off date.<br>
The rules for issuing and the content of the<br>
program are, for example:<br>
5	- an offer of a drink as from 15 FF of pur-<br>
chases, (line 51)<br>
-	an   offer of a T-shirt as   from   40   FF of pur¬<br>
chases, (line 52)<br>
-	20% off a selection of discs as from 75 FF of<br>
10  purchases (line 53)<br>
-	an offer of a meal at the restaurant of the<br>
shop as from 120 FF of purchases, (line 54).<br>
A scale 55 makes it possible to view the thresh¬olds corresponding to the advantages directly.<br>
15	Information 56 on The validity, on the name of<br>
the trader 57 and on the navigation means 58 (return to the main menu 59 and/or move on 60 to the other traders or programs) are provided here directly on the screen 61, which is a touch screen.<br>
20	Other objectives can be sought, such as increas-<br>
ing the frequency of monthly visits and/or the average shopping basket, for example.<br>
The operation of the invention will now be de¬scribed in the  ontext of a particular example, by ref-<br>
25  erence to figure 1.<br>
When a card carrier 2 wants to get to know the contents of his smart card, it is sufficient for him to<br>
22<br><br>
insert it into the card reader incorporated in or con¬nected to the device 1.<br>
At that moment, the Interpreter means 6 access the information contained in the card 2, by way of the 5  Read/Write Interface circuit 5.<br>
When the information contained in the card is comprehensive, the Interpreter means 6 distribute these data to the Main Application Module 7.<br>
When the information contained in the card is 10 partial, the Interpreter means 6 obtain the missing in¬formation by means of a remote interrogation of the In¬formation Server 20 by way of the Communications Module 13 and of the Protocol Interface 11.<br>
The Interpreter means 6 then compare the Infor-15 mation from the card wIth that originating from the Server, then distribute it to the Main Application Mod¬ule.<br>
After receiving these data, the Main Application<br>
Module 7 formats them and transmits them to the display<br>
20  means 10 for viewing. These data can then be consulted<br>
by the carrier by means of the Navigation means or the<br>
Tool 10.<br>
It goes without saying, and it also results from the foregoing, that the present invention is not lim-25 ited to the embodiments more particularly described. On the contrary, it embraces all the variants.<br>
23<br><br><br>

scale as a function of a predetermined unit of measurement of said<br>
program,<br>
-calculate the constant size of each interval,<br>
-display the end points of said scale and a state, called qualitative state,<br>
associated beforehand with said scale,<br>
-calculate    the    distance   between   two    graduations    of   the    scale<br>
corresponding to an interval,<br>
24<br><br>
-calculate the level of the scale as a function of the data from the behavior<br>
files,<br>
-and display said scale level.<br>
