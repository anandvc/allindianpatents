				<td>Herbicidal compositions comprising pyroxasulfone IV<br>
The present invention relates to herbicidally active compositions, which comprise 3-[5-<br>
(difiuoromethoxy)-1-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazol-4-ylmethyisulfonyi]-4,5-dihydro-<br>
5,5-dimethyl-1,2-oxazole [common name pyroxasulfone] and at least one herbicide B.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In crop protection, it is desirable in principle to increase the specificity and the reliability<br>
of the action of active compounds. In particular, it is desirable for the crop protection<br>
product to control the harmful plants effectively and, at the same time, to be tolerated<br>
by the useful plants in question.<br>
Pyroxasulfone has been described in EP-A 1364946 and US 2005/0256004.<br>
Although pyroxasulfone is a highly effective pre-emergence herbicide, its activity at low<br>
application rates is not always satisfactory. Moreover, pyroxasulfone is known to have<br>
only poor post-emergence activity (Y. Yamaji et al., "Application timing and field per-<br>
formance of KlH-485", Conference Abstract l-1-ii-12B of 11. IUPAC International Con-<br>
gress of Pesticide Chemistry, 2006 Kobe, Japan). Apart from that, its compatibility with<br>
certain dicotyledonous crop plants, such as cotton, sunflower, soybean, brassica crops,<br>
such as canola and oilseed rape, and some gramineous crops such as rice, wheat, rye<br>
and barley is not always satisfactory, i.e. in addition to the harmful plants, the crop<br>
plants are also damaged to an extent which is not acceptable. Though it is In principle<br>
possible to spare crop plants by lowering the application rates, the extent of the control<br>
of harmful plants is naturally also reduced.<br>
It is known that combined application of certain different herbicides with specific action<br>
might result in an enhanced activity of a herbicide component in comparison with a<br>
simple additive action. Such an enhanced activity is also termed a synergism or syner-<br>
gistic activity. As a consequence, it is possible to reduce the application rates of herbi-<br>
cidally active compounds required for controlling the harmful plants.<br>
WO 2005/104848 describes compositions containing a herbicidal 3-sulfonylisoxazoline<br>
compounds such as pyroxasulfone and a herbicide-antagonistically active amount of a<br>
safener. Similar compositions are known from WO 2007/006509.<br>
US 2005/256004, for example, discloses that in a pre-emergence treatment, joint appli-<br>
cation of certain herbicidal 3-sulfonylisoxazoline compounds such as pyroxasulfone<br>
with atrazine or cyanazine results in an increased overall herbicide action against cer-<br>
tain monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous annual broadleaf weeds (lambsquarter,<br>
green foxtail, veivetleaf) in comparison with a simple expected additive action.<br>
WO 2006/097322 discloses a herbicidal composition comprising pyroxasulfone and a<br>
second herbicide selected from tembotrione, topramezone and 4-hydroxy-3-[[2-[(2-<br>
methoxyethoxy)methyl]-6-{trifluoromethyl-3-pyridinyl]carbonyl]bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-ene-2-<br>
one.<br>
WO 2006/097509 discloses a herbicidal composition comprising a herbicidal 3-<br>
sulfonylisoxazoline compound such as pyroxasulfone and a phenyluracil compound.<br>
Unfortunately, it is usually not possible to predict synergistic activity for combinations of<br>
known herbicides, even if the compounds show a close structural similarity to known<br>
synergistic combinations.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide herbicidal compositions, which show<br>
enhanced herbicide action in comparison with the herbicide action of pyroxasulfone<br>
against undesirable harmful plants, in particular against Alopecurus myosuroides,<br>
Avena fatua, Bromus spec, Echinocloa spec. Lolium spec, Phalaris spec, Setaria<br>
spec, Digitaria spec, Brachiaria spec, Amaranthus spec, Chenopodium spec, Abuti-<br>
lon theophrasti, Galium aparine, Veronica spec, or Solanum spec and/or to improve<br>
their compatibility with crop plants, in particular improved compatibility with wheat, bar-<br>
ley, rye, rice, soybean, sunflower, brassica crops and/or cotton. The composition<br>
should also have a good herbicidal activity in post-emergence applications. The com-<br>
positions should also show an accelerated action on harmful plants, i.e. they should<br>
effect damaging of the harmful plants more quickly in comparison with application of<br>
the individual herbicides.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by herbicidally active composi-<br>
tions comprising<br>
a) pyroxasulfone, i.e. 3-[5-(difluoromethoxy)-1-methyl-3-(trifiuoromethyl)pyrazol-4-<br>
ylmethylsulfonyl]-4,5-dihydro-5,5-dimethyl-1,2-oxazole (hereinafter also referred<br>
to as herbicide A);<br>
and<br>
b) at least one herbicide compound B which is an selected from inhibitors of the<br>
very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) synthesis.<br>
The invention relates in particular to compositions in the form of herbicidally active<br>
compositions as defined above.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the use of a composition as defined herein for con-<br>
trolling undesirable vegetation, in particular in crops. When using the compositions of<br>
the invention for this purpose the herbicide A and the at least one herbicide B can be<br>
applied simultaneously or in succession, where undesirable vegetation may occur.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the use of a composition as defined herein for con-<br>
trolling undesirable vegetation in crops which, by genetic engineering or by breeding,<br>
are resistant or tolerant to one or more herbicides and/or pathogens such as plant-<br>
pathogenous fungi, and/or to attack by insects; preferably resistant or tolerant to one or<br>
more herbicides that act as VLCFA synthesis inhibitors.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation,<br>
which comprises applying an herbicidal composition according to the present invention<br>
to the undesirable plants. Application can be done before, during and/or after, prefera-<br>
bly during and/or after, the emergence of the undesirable plants. The herbicide A and<br>
the at least one herbicide B can be applied simultaneously or in succession.<br>
The invention in particular relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation in<br>
crops, which comprises applying an herbicidal composition according to the present<br>
invention in crops where undesirable vegetation occurs or might occur.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation,<br>
which comprises allowing a composition according to the present invention to act on<br>
plants, their habitat or on seed.<br>
In the uses and methods of the present invention it is immaterial whether the herbicide<br>
A and the at least one herbicide B are formulated and applied jointly or separately, and,<br>
in the case of separate application, in which order the application takes place. It is only<br>
necessary, that the herbicide A and the at least one herbicide B are applied in a time<br>
frame, which allows simultaneous action of the active ingredients on the plants.<br>
The invention also relates to a herbicide formulation, which comprises a herbicidally<br>
active composition as defined herein and at least one carrier material, including liquid<br>
and/or solid carrier materials.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention have better herbicidal activity<br>
against harmful plants than would have been expected by the herbicidal activity of the<br>
individual compounds. In other words, the joint action of pyroxasulfone and the at least<br>
one herbicide B results in an enhanced activity against harmful plants in the sense of a<br>
synergy effect (synergism). For this reason, the compositions can, based on the indi-<br>
vidual components, be used at lower application rates to achieve a herbicidal effect<br>
comparable to the individual components. Moreover, the compositions of the present<br>
invention provide good post-emergence herbicidal activity, i.e. the compositions are<br>
particularly useful for combating/controlling harmful plants after their emergence. Apart<br>
form that, the compositions of the present invention show good crop compatibility, i.e.<br>
their use in crops leads to a reduced damage of the crop plants and/or does not result<br>
in increased damage of the crop plants.<br>
As used herein, the terms "controlling" and "combating" are synonyms.<br>
As used herein, the terms "undesirable vegetation" and "harmful plants" are synonyms.<br>
The compositions of the invention comprise pyroxasulfone as a first component a).<br>
As a second component b), the compositions of the invention comprise at least one<br>
herbicide B which is an inhibitor of the VLCFA synthesis (VLCFA inhibitor). VLCFA<br>
inhibitors are compounds which have a mode of action comprising the inhibition of the<br>
VLCA synthesis and/or the inhibition of cell division in plants and which belong to the<br>
group K3 of the HRAC classification system (see HRAC, Classification of Herbicides<br>
According to Mode of Action, http://www.plantprotection.org/hrac/MOA.html).<br>
VLCFA inhibitors include e.g. chloroacetamide herbicides, such as acetochlor, alachlor,<br>
butachlor, dimethachlor, dimethenamid, dimethenamid-P, metazachlor, metolachlor, S-<br>
metolachlor, pethoxamid, pretilachlor, propachlor, propisochlor and thenylchlor, oxya-<br>
cetamide heribicides, such as flufenacet and mefenacet, acetamide herbicides, such as<br>
as diphenamid, napropamide and naproanilide, tetrazolinone herbicides, such as fen-<br>
trazamide as well as herbicides not belonging to a common group, such as anilofos,<br>
cafenstrole and piperophos. The term "VLCFA inhibitor" is meant herein to also include<br>
the respective salts, isomers and esters of the above mentioned compounds. Suitable<br>
salts are e.g. salts of alkaline or earth alkaline metals or ammonium or organoammo-<br>
nium salts, for instance, sodium, pottasium, ammonium, isopropyl ammonium etc. Suit-<br>
able isomers are e.g. stereo isomers such as the enantiomers. Suitable esters are e.g.<br>
C1-C8-(branched or non-branched) alkyl esters, such as methylesters, ethylesters, iso<br>
propyl esters.<br>
Preferred VLCFA inhibitors according to the present invention are selected from the<br>
group consisting of chloroacetamide herbicides, in particular acetochlor, dimethachior,<br>
dimethenamid, dimethenamid-P, metazachlor, propisochlor, pethoxamide, metolachlor,<br>
and metolachlor-S and oxyacetamide herbicides, in particular flufenacet.<br>
In the compositions of the present invention the relative weight ratio of pyroxasulfone to<br>
herbicide B is preferably in the range from 1:250 to 250:1, in particular in the range of<br>
1:200 to 200:1 and more preferably from 150:1 to 1:150. Accordingly, in the methods<br>
and uses of the invention, pyroxasulfone and the at least one herbicide B are applied<br>
within these weight ratios.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also comprise, as a component c), one or more<br>
safeners. Safeners, also termed as herbicide safeners, are organic compounds which<br>
in some cases lead to better crop plant compatibility when applied jointly with specifi-<br>
cally acting herbicides. Some safeners are themselves herbicidally active. In these<br>
cases, the safeners act as antidote or antagonist in the crop plants and thus reduce or<br>
even prevent damage to the crop plants. However, in the compositions of the present<br>
invention, safeners are generally not required. Therefore, a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention relates to compositions which contain no safener or virtually no safener<br>
(i.e. less than 1 % by weight, based on the total amount of herbicide A and herbicide<br>
B).<br>
Suitable safeners, which can be used in the compositions according to the present in-<br>
vention, are known in the art, e.g. from<br>

oxabetrinil, as well as thereof agriculturally acceptable salts and, provided they have a<br>
carboxyl group, their agriculturally acceptable derivatives. 2,2,5-Trimethyl-3-<br>
(dichloroacetyl)-1,3-cxazolidine [CAS No. 52836-31-4] is also known under the name<br>
R-29148.4-(Dichloroacetyl)-1-oxa-4- azaspiro[4.5]decane [CAS No. 71526-07-03] is<br>
also known under the names AD-67 and MON 4660.<br>

oxazolidine, and 4-(dlchloroacetyi)-1-oxa-4-azaspiro[4.5]decane and oxabetrinil; and<br>
the agriculturally acceptable salt thereof and, in the case of compounds having a<br>
COOH group, an agriculturally acceptable derivative as defined below.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to compositions which contain no<br>
safener or virtually no safener (i.e. less than 1 % by weight, based on the total amount<br>
of herbicide A and the at least one herbicide B is applied).<br>
The compositions of the invention may also comprise, as a component d), one or more<br>
herbicides D which are different from the herbicides A and B. Such further herbicides D<br>
may broaden the activity spectrum of the inventive compositions. However, further<br>
herbicides D are generally not required. Therefore, a preferred embodiment of the in-<br>
vention relates to compositions which contain no further herbicide D or virtually no fur-<br>
ther herbicide D (i.e. less than 1 % by weight, based on the total amount of herbicide A<br>
and herbicide B).<br>
Another embodiment of the invention however relates to compositions which contain a<br>
herbicide D selected from the group consisting of quinmerac, salts of quinmerac and<br>
clomazone. A similar embodiment of the invention relates to compositions which con-<br>
tain a herbicide D selected from the group consisting of aminopyralid and the salts<br>
thereof.<br>
In particular, the compositions of the present invention consist of the herbicide A and<br>
the at least one herbicide B, i.e. they neither contain a safener nor a further herbicide D<br>
other than quinmerac, salts of quinmerac, aminopyralid, salts of aminopyralid and clo-<br>
mazone.<br>
If compositions of the present invention contain clomazone or quinmerac, the relative<br>
weight ratio of clomazone, aminopyralid or quinmerac to herbicide B is preferably in the<br>
range from 1:200 to 200:1, in particular in the range of 1:100 to 100:1 and more pref-<br>
erably from 1:50 to 50:1. The weight ratio of pyroxasuifone to the total amount of herbi-<br>
cide B + clomazone or quinmerac is then preferably from 1:500 to 250:1, in particular in<br>
the range of 1:250 to 100:1 and more preferably from 1:200 to 50:1.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention relates to compositions which additionally com-<br>
prise a herbicide D selected from the group consisting of imidazolinone herbicides and<br>
their mixtures with quinmerac, aminopyralid or their salts or clomazone. In the em-<br>
bodiment, the composition of the present invention preferably consists of herbicide A,<br>
the at least one herbicide B, and the further herbicide D which is selected from imida-<br>
zolinone herbicides, i.e. they neither contain a safener nor a further herbicide D other<br>
than an imidazolinone herbicide, quinmerac, aminopyralid or a salt thereof or cloma-<br>
zone.<br>
Imidazolinone herbicides include e.g. imazapic, imazamethabenz, imazamox, ima-<br>
zapyr, imazaquin, and imazethapyr and the salts thereof and in case of imazametha-<br>
benz the esters thereof such as imazamethabenz-methyl. Preferred imidazolinone her-<br>
bicides are selected from imazapic, imazamox and the salts and esters thereof.<br>
In the compositions of this particular embodiment the relative weight ratio of pyroxasul-<br>
fone to imidazolinone herbicide D is preferably in the range from 1:500 to 500:1, in par-<br>
ticular in the range from 1:250 to 250:1 and more preferably from 100:1 to 1:100. Ac-<br>
cordingly, in the methods and uses of the invention, pyroxasulfone and the imidazoli-<br>
none herbicide are applied within these weight ratios.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to compositions which additionally com-<br>
prise at least one further herbicide D which is selected from herbicides that are inhibi-<br>
tors of the photosystem II, which are also termed as PS-II inhibitors or ETP inhibitors.<br>
PS-II inhibitors are compounds, which have a mode of action comprising the inhibition<br>
of the electron transfer in photosystem II of the photosynthesis in plants and which be-<br>
long to the groups C1 to C3 of the HRAC classification system (see HRAC, Classifica-<br>
tion of Herbicides According to Mode of Action,<br>
http://www.plantprotection.org/hrac/MOA.html). In this embodiment, the composition of<br>
the present invention preferably consists of herbicide A, the at least one herbicide B,<br>
and the further herbicide D which is selected from PS-II inhibitor herbicides, i.e. they<br>
neither contain a safener nor a further herbicide D other than a herbicide of the group<br>
of PS-II inhibitors.<br>
Preferably, the PS-II inhibitors are selected from the group consisting of:<br>
d.1 arylurea herbicides;<br>

Arylurea herbicides (group d.1), triazin(di)one heribicides (group d.2), methylthiotriazine<br>
herbicides (group d.3) and chlorotriazine herbicides (group d.3)are known e.g. from K.-<br>
W. Munks and K.-H. Müller "Photosynthesis Inhibitors" in "Modem Crop Protection<br>
Compounds" Vol. 1, Wiley-VHC 2007, pp 359-400; C.D.S. Tomlin, "The Pesticide<br>
Manual", 13th Edition, BCPC (2003), and also from The Compendium of Pesticide<br>
Common Names, http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/.<br>
In the compositions of this particular embodiment the relative weight ratio of pyroxasul-<br>
fone to PS-II inhibitor herbicide D is preferably in the range from 1:500 to 500:1, in par-<br>
ticular in the range from 1:250 to 250:1 and more preferably from 100:1 to 1:100. Ac-<br>
cordingly, in the methods and uses of the invention, pyroxasulfone and the herbicide D<br>
are applied within these weight ratios.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to compositions which additionally com-<br>
prise at least one further herbicide D which is selected from herbicides that are inhibi-<br>
tors of the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which are also termed as HPPD<br>
inhibitors. HPPD inhibitors are herbicide compounds, which have a mode of action<br>
comprising the inhibition of the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase in plants and<br>
which belong to the group F2 of the HRAC classification system (see HRAC, Classifi-<br>
cation of Herbicides According to IVIode of Action,<br>
http://www.plantprotection.org/hrac/MOA.html). In this embodiment, the composition of<br>
the present invention preferably consists of herbicide A, the at least one herbicide B,<br>
and the further herbicide D which is selected from HPPD inhibitor herbicides, i.e. they<br>
neither contain a safener nor a further herbicide D other than a herbicide of the group<br>
of HPPD inhibitors.<br>
HPPD inhibitor herbicides include e.g. isoxafiutole, sulcotrione, mesotrione, tem-<br>

The compositions of the invention are particularly suitable for application in wheat, bar-<br>
ley, rye, corn, sugarcane, sorghum, soybean, pulse crops, sunflower, sugarbeet, po-<br>
tato, brassica crops and turf.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also be used in crop plants which are<br>
resistant or tolerant to one or more herbicides owing to genetic engineering or breed-<br>
ing, which are resistant or tolerant to one or more pathogens owing to genetic engi-<br>
neering or breeding, or which are resistant or tolerant to attack by insects owing to ge-<br>
netic engineering or breeding. Suitable are for example crop plants, preferably corn,<br>
wheat, sorghum, bariey, sunflower, rice, canola, oilseed rape, soybeans or lentils which<br>
are resistant or tolerant to herbicidal VLCA inhibitors, such as, for example, acetochlor,<br>
dimethachlor, dimethenamid, dimethenamid-P, metazachlor, propisochlor, pethox-<br>
amide, metolachlor, metolachlor-S or flufenacet, orcrop plants which, owing to intro-<br>
duction of the gene for Bt toxin by genetic modification, are resistant to attack by cer-<br>
tain insects.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be applied in conventional manner by<br>
using techniques a skilled person is familiar with. Suitable techniques include spraying,<br>
atomizing, dusting, spreading or watering. The type of application depends on the in-<br>
tended purpose in a well known manner; in any case, the technique should ensure the<br>
finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the invention.<br>
The compositions can be applied pre- or post-emergence, i.e. before, during and/or<br>
after emergence of the undesirable plants. When the compositions are used in crops,<br>
they can be applied after seeding and before the emergence of the crop plants. The<br>
compositions invention can, however, also be applied prior to seeding of the crop<br>
plants.<br>
It is a particular benefit of the compositions according to the invention that they have a<br>
very good post-emergence herbicide activity, i.e. they show a good herbicidal activity<br>
against emerged undesirable plants. Thus, In a preferred embodiment of invention, the<br>
compositions are applied post-emergence, i.e. during and/or after the emergence of the<br>
undesirable plants. It is particularly advantageous to apply the mixtures according to<br>
the invention post-emergent when the undesirable plant starts with leaf development of<br>
up to 6 leaves. Since the composition show good crop tolerance, even when the crop<br>
has already emerged, they can be applied after seeding of the crop plants and in par-<br>
ticular during or after the emergence of the crop plants.<br>
In any case herbicide A and the at least one herbicide B and the optional further ac-<br>
tives (safener C and herbicide D) can be applied simultaneously or in succession.<br>
The compositions are applied to the plants mainly by spraying, in particular foliar spray-<br>
ing. Application can be carried out by customary spraying techniques using, for exam-<br>
ple, water as carrier and spray liquor rates of from about 10 to 2000 I/ha or 50 to 1000<br>
I/ha (for example from 100 to 500 I/ha). Application of the herbicidal compositions by<br>
the low-volume and the ultra-low-volume method is possible, as is their application in<br>
the form of microgranules.<br>
If the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application tech-<br>
niques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of<br>
the spray apparatus, in such a way that they come into as little contact, if any, with the<br>
leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants,<br>
which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
In the case of a post-emergence treatment of the plants, the herbicidal mixtures or<br>
compositions according to the invention are preferably applied by foliar application.<br>
Application may be effected, for example, by usual spraying techniques with water as<br>
the carrier, using amounts of spray mixture of approx. 50 to 1000 I/ha.<br>
The required application rate of the composition of the pure active compounds, i.e. of<br>
pyroxasulfone, herbicide B and optionally safener or herbicide D depends on the den-<br>
sity of the undesired vegetation, on the development stage of the plants, on the climatic<br>
conditions of the location where the composition is used and on the application<br>
method. In general, the application rate of the composition (total amount of pyroxasul-<br>
fone, herbicide B and optional further actives) is from 15 to 6000 g/ha, frequently from<br>
15 to 5000 g/ha, preferably from 20 to 2500 g/ha of active substance.<br>

to 500 g/ha and preferably in the range from 5 g/ha to 400 g/ha or from 10 g/ha to 300<br>
g/ha of active substance.<br>
The required application rates of the herbicide B (total amount of herbicide B) are gen-<br>
erally in the range from 1 g/ha to 5000 g/ha and preferably in the range from 5 g/ha to<br>
4000 g/ha or from 10 g/ha to 3000 g/ha of active substance.<br>

1 g/ha to 5000 g/ha and preferably in the range from 2 g/ha to 5000 g/ha or from 5 g/ha<br>
to 5000 g/ha of active substance. Preferably no safener or virtually no safener is ap-<br>
plied and thus the application rates are below 5 g/ha, in particular below 2 g/ha or be-<br>
low 1 g/ha.<br>
The required application rates of the further herbicide D, if applied, depends from the<br>
nature of the herbicide D and may generally be in the range from 0.1 g/ha to 5000 g/ha<br>
and preferably in the range from 0.1 g/ha to 5000 g/ha or from 1 g/ha to 5000 g/ha of<br>
active substance.<br>
In case of nicosulfuron, the application rate is generally in the range of 0.1 to 200 g/ha,<br>
preferably from 1 to 150 g/ha, in particular from 2 to 100 g/ha of active substance.<br>

1. Products for dilution with water<br>
A Water-soluble concentrates<br>
10 parts by weight of active compound (or composition) are dissolved in 90 parts by<br>
weight of water or a water-soluble solvent. As an alternative, wetters or other adjuvants<br>
are added. The active compound dissolves upon dilution with water. This gives a<br>
formulation with an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
B Dispersible concentrates<br>
20 parts by weight of active compound (or composition) are dissolved in 70 parts by<br>
weight of cyclohexanone with addition of 10 parts by weight of a dispersant, for<br>

weight of an organic solvent (eg. alkylaromatics) with addition of calcium<br>
dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each case 5 parts by weight).<br>
Dilution with water gives an emulsion. The formulation has an active compound content<br>
of 15% by weight.<br>

This mixture is introduced into 30 parts by weight of water by means of an emulsifier<br>
(Ultraturrax) and made into a homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an<br>
emulsion. The formulation has an active compound content of 25% by weight.<br>

50 parts by weight of active compound (or composition) are ground finely with addition<br>
of 50 parts by weight of dispersants and wetters and made into water-dispersible or<br>
water-soluble granules by means of technical appliances (for example extrusion, spray<br>
tower, fluidized bed). Dilution with water gives a stable dispersion or solution of the<br>
active compound. The formulation has an active compound content of 50% by weight.<br>

or of an organic solvent are mixed to give a fine suspension. Dilution with water gives a<br>
stable suspension with active compound content of 20% by weight.<br>
2. Products to be applied undiluted<br>
I Dusts<br>
5 parts by weight of active compound (or composition) are ground finely and mixed<br>
intimately with 95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dusting powder<br>
with an active compound content of 5% by weight.<br>
J Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 parts by weight of active compound (or composition) are ground finely and<br>
associated with 99.5 parts by weight of carriers. Current methods here are extrusion,<br>
spray-drying or the fluidized bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted with an<br>
active compound content of 0.5% by weight.<br>
K U LV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of active compound (or composition) are dissolved in 90 parts by<br>
weight of an organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied<br>
undiluted with an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes,<br>
wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water.<br>
It may furthermore be beneficial to apply the compositions of the invention alone or in<br>
combination with other herbicides, or else in the form of a mixture with other crop<br>
protection agents, for example together with agents for controlling pests or<br>
phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt<br>
solutions, which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies.<br>
Other additives such as non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
Use Examples<br>
The effect of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention of herbicides A and<br>
B and, if appropriate, safener on the growth of undesirable plants compared to the her-<br>
bicidally active compounds alone was demonstrated by the following greenhouse ex-<br>
periments:<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, directly after sowing the active compounds, which<br>
had been suspended or emulsified in water, were applied by means of finely distributed<br>
nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and<br>
subsequently covered with transparent plastic hoods until plant had rooted. This cover<br>
caused uniform germination of the tests plants, unless this was adversely affected by<br>
active compounds.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to<br>
20 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated. Here, the herbicidal com-<br>
positions were suspended or emulsified in water as distribution medium and sprayed<br>
using finely distributing nozzles.<br>
The respective herbicides A and/or safener were formulated as 10% by weight strength<br>
emulsion concentrate and introduced to the spray liquor with the amount of solvent<br>
system used for applying the active compound. In the examples, the solvent used was<br>
water. Herbicide B and/or safener were used as commercially available formulations<br>
and introduced to the spray liquor with the amount of solvent system used for applying<br>
the active compound. In the examples, the solvent used was water.<br>
Metazachlor was used as a commercial aqueous suspension concentrate having an<br>
active ingredient concentration of 500 g/l.<br>
The test period extended over 21 days. During this time, the plants were tended, and<br>
their response to the treatments with active compound was evaluated.<br>
The evaluation for the damage caused by the chemical compositions was carried out<br>
using a scale from 0 to 100%, compared to the untreated control plants. Here, 0 means<br>
no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
The plants used in the greenhouse experiments belonged to the following species:<br>
Colby's formula was applied to determine whether the composition showed synergistic<br>
action. The value E, which is to be expected if the activity of the individual compounds<br>
is just additive, was calculated using the method of S. R. Colby (1967) "Calculating<br>
synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, p. 22 ff.<br>
<br>
where X = effect in percent using herbicide A at an application rate a;<br>
Y = effect in percent using herbicide B at an application rate b;<br>
E = expected effect (in %) of A + B at application rates a + b.<br>
If the value observed in this manner is higher than the value E calculated according to<br>
Colby, a synergistic effect is present.<br>
An accelerated activity is observed when the damage 8 days after treatment (8 DAT)<br>
achieved by the combination shows a synergistic effect.<br>
Table 1a relates to the herbicidal activity of the individual actives in pre-emergence<br>
application assessed 8 DAT and 20 DAT. Table 1b relates the herbicidal activity of the<br>
combined actives in pre-emergence application assessed 8 DAT and 20 DAT.<br>
Table 2a relates to the herbicidal activity of the individual actives in post-emergence<br>
application assessed 8 DAT and 20 DAT. Table 2b relates the herbicidal activity of the<br>
combined actives in post-emergence application assessed 8 DAT and 20 DAT.<br>
Table 3 relates to the herbicidal activity of the individual actives and of the combina-<br>
tions in post-emergence application assessed 20 DAT.<br>
