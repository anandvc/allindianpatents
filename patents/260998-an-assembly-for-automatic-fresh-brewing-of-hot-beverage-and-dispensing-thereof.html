				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to an assembly for automatic fresh brewing of hot<br>
beverage and dispensing thereof wherein when an operating command is given<br>
by an operator on an electronic control panel, the assembly in conjunction with<br>
an electronic processor provided therein, automatically brews and dispenses<br>
customized hot beverage using a single serving pod within a short time, as per<br>
input command signals relating to the consumer's preference like 'strong',<br>
Night', 'with milk', 'without milk', etc. selectable on the electronic control panel.<br>
A wide variety of hot brewed beverage, hot water infusion or other hot<br>
beverages may be prepared with the assembly by placing different brewing,<br>
infusible or other materials in the single serving pod of the present invention.<br>
The brewing, infusible or other materials which can be used in the pod include,<br>
without implying any limitation thereto, materials such as tea, coffee, materials<br>
of plant origin such as floral pieces like Jasmine flowers, vegetable pieces like<br>
carrots and onions, materials of animal origin such as honey or any other<br>
suitable beverage powder or material that can be used in the pod.<br>
The assembly is capable of brewing each individual single serving of hot<br>
beverage with perfect consistency and with high speed, the taste and flavor<br>
being like the beverage that has been manually prepared at that instant of time<br>
and at that location. The assembly is, specifically, but without implying any<br>
limitation thereto, useful for meeting the bulk demand for a brewed hot<br>
beverage, in a time-efficient manner, in offices, ceremonial functions, public<br>
meetings, etc.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Several hot beverage-dispensing machines known in the art use a pre-mix<br>
powder to provide a pre-mix based beverage to the consumer. The pre-mix<br><br>
powder used in such dispensing machines contains either tea or coffee powder<br>
mixed with sugar, milk powder, etc. Such pre-mix powder is combined with hot<br>
water dispensed from the machine, and the hot beverage thus prepared is<br>
served to the consumer.<br>
A drawback of the above type of dispensing machine is that the pre-mix based<br>
hot beverage prepared by just mixing hot water from the dispensing machine<br>
with a premix powder of tea or coffee is inferior in taste and flavor as compared<br>
to that of a freshly prepared hot beverage of the same type. For example,<br>
taste, aroma and flavor of the coffee prepared using a pre-mix powder would<br>
not match with that of a coffee that has been freshly prepared from coffee<br>
beans. A consumer generally prefers a freshly brewed hot beverage like tea or<br>
coffee, customized to his preference of strength and taste.<br>
Another drawback of the above type of dispensing machine is that any quality<br>
of pre-mix powder may be mixed with hot water to prepare final beverage. The<br>
quality of final beverage thus prepared depends upon the quality of the pre-mix<br>
powder used. Any inferior/spurious quality pre-mix powder used in the<br>
preparation of the hot beverage would provide poor quality beverage lacking in<br>
taste, aroma and flavor. The machines of this type have no inherent means to<br>
prevent the use of such inferior/spurious quality pre-mix powders.<br>
Further drawback of the above type of dispensing machines is that the<br>
beverage prepared may lack consistency due to variation in dosing of the pre-<br>
mix powder.<br>
An 'Espresso Brewing Device' reported in US patent No. 6,820,535 comprises a<br>
rotatable magazine table equipped with five magazine tubes arranged along the<br>
circumference of the said table, each magazine holding a stack of single-serving<br>
capsules with their bottom membrane facing downwards and each magazine<br><br>
tube storing a different type of coffee/tea capsules. Each magazine tube has an<br>
opening through which the lowest capsule in the magazine tube is pushed out<br>
by a capsule gripper. Means (like sensors or scanners, etc.) are provided for<br>
setting the position of the magazine table. The capsule conveying device<br>
comprises a motor with a drive mechanism equipped with a driving disc and a<br>
driving stud. An actuating lever, swivel-mounted on a rotation bearing, ejects<br>
out a single serving capsule and inserts it into the brewing unit.<br>
Once, the single serving capsule is inside the brewing unit, the spindle piston<br>
gets lowered into the brewing position by means of a spindle piston drive which<br>
includes a driving motor, a drive mechanism and a 'capsule piercer' provided in<br>
the upper part of the brewing chamber insert. The upper surface of the single<br>
serving capsule is pierced by the capsule piercer that points downwards and<br>
contains brewing water supply channels located inside therein. The brewing<br>
water flows into the single serving capsule at a pressure of 10 to 15 bars and at<br>
a temperature of approx. 95°C. When an inner pressure of 6 bars is reached<br>
within the capsule, the membrane forming the base of the capsule is pressed<br>
against the pyramid-shaped profile of a plate and the membrane gets pierced.<br>
The brew flows out through draining holes on the plate and the outlet opening<br>
of the brewing unit.<br>
A drawback of the above device is that it is a complex design requiring multiple<br>
piercing means. One side of the single serving capsule containing brewing<br>
substance is pierced by a capsule-piercer for entry of hot pressurized water into<br>
the capsule. The other side of the capsule is pierced by a plate having multiple<br>
pyramid-profiled points for allowing the brewed beverage to flow out.<br>
Another drawback of the above device is that there is a complex mechanism for<br>
conveying of the capsule from the magazine tube to the brewing unit which<br><br>
involves an actuating lever, drive motor, driving disc, driving stud, capsule<br>
gripper, and the actuating lever being swivel mounted on a rotation bearing.<br>
Similarly, the brewing unit also involves complex mechanism involving spindle<br>
piston drive consisting of a drive motor, drive mechanism, drive pin engaging<br>
with an outer gear tooth system of a spindle piston drive gear equipped with<br>
inner gear tooth system, and so on. The complexity of the machine and<br>
relatively more number of moving components may cause higher operating and<br>
maintenance costs, in addition to being more expensive to manufacture.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above brewing machine is that the outflow of<br>
the brewed liquid occurs through the holes in membrane of the capsule, which<br>
are caused due to piercing by a pyramid-profiled plate. These holes may allow<br>
fine tea/coffee particles to pass through along with the brewed liquid, thereby<br>
adversely affecting the quality of the hot beverage dispensed into the<br>
dispensing cup or blocking the exit tubes that convey the brewed liquid out of<br>
the brewing unit.<br>
Further drawback of the above assembly is that the inflow of hot water takes<br>
place from one side and outflow occurs from other side of the capsule with the<br>
result that the brewing of the brewing material contained in the capsule is not<br>
thorough as some of the brewing material particles may not be brewed.<br>
Additionally, the arrangement of inflow of water from one side and outflow<br>
from the other side of capsule results in the design of the assembly being very<br>
complex and the brewer unit becoming bulky.<br>
Another prior art dispensing machine is reported in the PCT application No.<br>
PCT/US2005/031604 titled as "Coffee and tea dispenser with removable pod<br>
turret wheel". The invention comprises a turret assembly, a water control<br>
system controlling the flow of water in the beverage dispenser, a heat<br><br>
exchanger placed in water reservoir heated by a heat source, an injector<br>
assembly, a loading assembly including a pod carousel with pod compartments<br>
containing pod cartridges and an electronic control. The turret assembly<br>
includes a turret frame, a turret plate and a turret shaft connecting the turret<br>
plate to the turret frame for rotation therewith, by a turret motor. The water<br>
control system in the above device includes a water source like a tap, water<br>
lines, a secondary water source, an extraction pump to pressurize the water<br>
and a flow sensor. An electronic control controls the operation of extraction<br>
pump, flow sensor, heat source, solenoid valve, etc. The injector assembly<br>
includes an injection nozzle, injector head movable vertically via a cam system,<br>
a drive motor and an eccentric cam. When eccentric cam rotates, an idler wheel<br>
pushes a support plate downward such that the injector head comes into<br>
contact with the pod cartridge. The electronic control then reverses the cam<br>
system and the injector head returns to its original position.<br>
A drawback of the above apparatus is that it is complex and cumbersome as<br>
compared to the machine of the present invention as the above apparatus<br>
requires a hot water reservoir of 7 to 19 liters capacity, a heat exchanger<br>
positioned within the said reservoir, and a network of water lines, besides,<br>
multiple electric, electronic and mechanical components as compared to the<br>
assembly of the present invention.<br>
Another drawback of the above apparatus is that the pod used in the apparatus<br>
is relatively complex and therefore may be more complex to manufacture and<br>
relatively more expensive as compared to the pod of simple design used in the<br>
present invention. In the above apparatus, the pod has thermoplastic insert<br>
with a plurality of apertures provided at the top of the pod, the insert being<br>
further covered with a foil. The bottom of the pod is made of a filter paper or a<br>
foil with a scored area, which becomes detached when the hot pressurized<br><br>
water gets injected into the pod. The hot pressurized water enters into the pod<br>
through the apertures in the insert and flows out through the scored area. The<br>
complexity and higher cost of the said pod result in increase of the final cost<br>
per cup of beverage, to the consumers.<br>
Further, in the above apparatus, the water flows into the pod from the top and<br>
flows out through the bottom, which necessitates provision of filter paper with<br>
apertures at one side and means for allowing the flow out of water from the<br>
other side.<br>
Still further drawback of the above apparatus is that the apparatus heats the<br>
water in the heat exchangers and thus heated water in turn heats the water<br>
flowing in the pipe placed inside the heat exchanger. The above device<br>
therefore, is not energy-efficient as compared to the assembly of the present<br>
invention wherein the heat exchanger is avoided and the hot water required for<br>
brewing is directly heated inside a sealed boiler tank by a heating element.<br>
Yet further drawback of the above apparatus is that the foil on the top side of<br>
the capsule is pierced by a separate injector assembly with complex<br>
configuration of an injection nozzle, injector head, a cam system drive motor,<br>
cam system, an eccentric cam, drive belt, an idler wheel support plate, injector<br>
frame and a number of guide wheels. Whereas in the present invention, the<br>
injection nozzle remains fixed to the base of the brewer and the plunger of the<br>
brewer sub-assembly presses the pod with its porous membrane facing<br>
downwards, against the conical tip of the injection nozzle leading to the<br>
puncturing of the porous membrane, thereby allowing the hot pressurized<br>
water from the boiler tank to flow into the pod through the interior of the<br>
injection nozzle.<br><br>

include, without implying any limitation thereto, materials such as tea, coffee,<br>
materials of plant origin such as floral pieces like jasmine flowers, vegetable<br>
pieces like carrots and onions, materials of animal origin such as honey or any<br>
other suitable beverage powder or material that can be used in the pod.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof wherein the<br>
single serving pods containing brewing material have external contour which<br>
conforms to the internal contour of the 'chute' where these are stacked and<br>
which also aligns with the inward contour of the forward end of the 'pod<br>
conveyor' for being conveyed by the pod-conveyor and being precisely<br>
positioned in the brewer sub-assembly. The assembly therefore has inherent<br>
means to limit the use to pods of specific design and dimensions thereby<br>
preventing the use of inferior/spurious pods.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof which enables<br>
the operator to prepare the beverages of different strengths customized to the<br>
consumer requirement like 'strong', 'light', 'with milk' and 'without milk', without<br>

brewing every minute particle of the brewing material contained in the pod.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof wherein the<br>
water at high temperature and pressure from the sealed boiler tank enters into<br><br>
the pod in the brewer sub-assembly during brewing, which enables a quick<br>

Still further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof which uses low<br>
cost single serving pods of simple structure as compared to some of the costly<br>
pods of complex structure known in the art (which incorporate puncturing or<br>
injecting means) and therefore the single serving pods of the present invention<br>
are easy to manufacture and are cost-effective thereby making the cost per cup<br>
viable for the consumers in the developing markets.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof which uses<br>
simple and static chutes containing stack of inverted single serving pods<br>
thereby minimizing the precision components required for alignment of pods<br>
within the chutes and thus also reducing the maintenance.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>

Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof wherein a non-<br>
corrosive and food grade filter disc having fine pores of up to 250 microns<br>
together with the porous membrane used on the top of the single serving pod<br>
prevents miniscule particles of brewing material from flowing into the<br><br>
dispensing cup along with the brewed liquid thereby ensuring fine quality of<br>
dispensed hot beverage.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof which uses<br>
completely sealed boiler tank that stores water at high temperatures without<br>
loss of dissolved oxygen contained within the water, which enhances the taste<br>
and quality of brewed beverage especially tea.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof wherein the<br>
brewer sub-assembly is substantially airtight during brewing which prevents the<br>
escape of the volatile chemicals which contribute to the aroma, flavor and taste<br>
of the prepared fresh hot beverage. These volatile chemicals which remain in<br>
the brewed liquid enhance the flavor, taste and aroma of the dispensed hot<br>
beverage.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof which uses<br>
completely sealed boiler tank, which makes the assembly energy-efficient.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof wherein the<br>
simplified design of water heating sub-assembly, pod-conveyor sub-assembly<br>
and the brewer sub-assembly results in lower manufacturing, operating and<br>
maintenance costs and higher reliability of the assembly.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof which<br>
incorporates a sensor placed beneath each chute. The sensor placed below the<br><br>
first chute which is in closer proximity to the brewer sub-assembly, detects and<br>
sends signal to an electronic processor when this chute is empty, which in turn<br>
triggers the pod-conveyor to move backward to behind a second chute placed<br>
adjacent to the first chute, on the same chute supporting plate, and convey<br>
pods from this chute. Similarly a sensor placed beneath the second chute<br>
senses when this second chute is empty and sends a signal to the electronic<br>
processor, which in turn causes pod-conveyor to move to its rest/start position<br>
behind first chute, causes halting of brewing process in the brewer sub-<br>
assembly till refill of the empty chutes with fresh pods and simultaneously<br>
sends signal to the electronic display panel providing message to the operator<br>
to refill the empty chutes with fresh pods. The presence of these sensors thus<br>
enhances the capability of the assembly to operate with a higher stock of pods<br>
stacked in plurality of chutes. This also eliminates the need for separate motor<br>
and associated mechanism for rotation of the base plate on which pod chutes<br>
are fitted, as is known in the art.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide an assembly for<br>
automatic fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof which<br>
incorporates a novel mechanism for brewing operations. The mechanism<br>
consists of a compressor, air storage tank and an air solenoid valve, which<br>
operates a pneumatic cylinder. This mechanism enables speedy up and down<br>
movements of the brewer plunger into the brewer chamber during brewing<br>
process resulting in significant reduction in cycle time per brew as compared to<br>
conventional methods using a cam type plunging mechanism<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention would be apparent from<br>
the understanding of the following detailed description when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings which are a part of this<br>
disclosure.<br><br>
Statement of Invention<br>
According to this invention, there is provided an assembly for automatic fresh<br>
brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof wherein the brewing, infusible<br>

rod (71) of the pneumatic cylinder (61) is operable up and down in the brewer<br>
chamber (65) by means of compressed air.<br>
The assembly of the present invention is capable of automatic fresh brewing of<br>
hot beverage and dispensing thereof using a single serving pod within short<br>
time of 15 to 20 seconds. A uniquely designed pod-conveyor having an inward<br>
contour at its forward end and lOtatable by an electric motor is capable of<br>
performing multiple functions by its rotational movement in a substantially<br><br>
horizontal plane and by holding the pod firmly within its inward contour at its<br>
forward end which is aligned with contour of the pod. The functions performed<br>
by the pod-conveyor include conveying the pod from a chute to brewer sub-<br>
assembly, precisely positioning it on the filter disc in the brewer sub-assembly<br>
without any provision of a guide channel having been provided in the assembly<br>
and then disposing off the used pod into the disposal bin. This greatly simplifies<br>
the design and minimizes mechanical components.<br>
The assembly is user friendly and easy to operate, as the operator/consumer<br>
has just to indicate his preference by selecting the switch on the electronic<br>
control panel corresponding to the consumer's preference for the type of<br>
beverage like 'strong', 'light', "with milk', "without milk', etc. The signal is<br>
conveyed by the electronic control panel to the electronic processor, which<br>
triggers the electrical components of other sub-assemblies in the required<br>
sequence and the assembly automatically performs all the necessary operations<br>
resulting in dispensing of ready-to-drink and customized hot beverage in a<br>
dispensing cup. The automatic operations of the assembly extend from<br>
conveying &amp; positioning of the pod into the brewer sub-assembly, injection of<br>
hot pressurized water into the pod containing brewing material, disposal of<br>
used pod into the disposal bin etc. to drawing of milk from a liquid milk<br>
container, heating milk in a milk-mixing chamber by steam from water-heating<br>
sub-assembly and the dispensing of thus heated milk directly into the<br>
dispensing cup when the milk is dosed with respect to the beverage. Each<br>
individual serving by the assembly is consistent in taste and flavor.<br>
The assembly includes a sensor placed underneath each chute. The sensor<br>
placed beneath the first chute which is in closer proximity to the brewer sub-<br>
assembly detects the availability of single serving pods in this chute. When it<br><br>
detects that this chute is empty, it gives signal to the electronic processor,<br>
which causes the pod-conveyor to move behind the second chute and convey<br>
pods therefrom to the brewer sub-assembly. A sensor placed beneath the<br>
second chute senses when this chute is empty and sends a signal to the<br>
electronic processor, which in turn causes the pod-conveyor to move to rest or<br>
start position behind first chute, causes halting till refill of the empty chutes<br>
with fresh pods, of the brewing process in the brewing sub-assembly by<br>
switching off power supply to air solenoid valve and also simultaneously sends<br>
a signal on the electronic display panel providing message to the operator to<br>
refill the empty chutes with fresh pods. Such provision of sensors enhances the<br>
capability of the assembly to operate with a substantially higher stock of pods<br>
stacked in plurality of static chutes to meet bulk demands like in offices, etc.<br>
This also eliminates the need for separate motor and associated mechanism for<br>
rotation of the base plate on which pod chutes are fitted, as is known in the art.<br>
A filter disc with pores less than 250 microns and the porous membrane used to<br>
cover and seal the brewing material contained in the single serving pods<br>
prevent miniscule brewing material particles from the pod to flow out along<br>
with the brewed liquid into the dispensing cup thereby ensuring high quality of<br>
brewed liquid.<br>
The sealed boiler tank stores water at high temperatures without loss of<br>
dissolved oxygen contained within the water, which enhances the quality of<br>
beverage especially tea. The use of a sealed boiler tank also makes the<br>
assembly energy-efficient. The brewer sub-assembly used in the present<br>
invention is substantially airtight during brewing which prevents the escape of<br>
aroma and other volatile chemicals. Such chemicals which remain in the brewed<br>
liquid further add to the flavor, taste and aroma of the dispensed hot beverage.<br><br>
The air, compressed by an air compressor and pumped and stored in an air<br>
storage tank, operates a pneumatic cylinder with the help of an air solenoid<br>
valve, thereby the pneumatic cylinder speedily moves the brewer plunger up<br>
and down into the brewer chamber, during the brewing process. This<br>
mechanism significantly improves the cycle time per brew when compared to<br>
conventional methods such as using a linear actuator consisting of a screw rod<br>
driven by an electric motor, or a cam and plunger assembly driven by an<br>
electric motor.<br>
The single serving pods used in the assembly have simple structure with no<br>
mechanism whatsoever embodied in the interior of the pods, thereby making<br>
the single serving pods easy to manufacture at low cost, thus making the cost<br>
per dispensed cup also low. The assembly is capable of brewing a wide variety<br>
of brewing, infusible and other materials that can be placed in these pods. Such<br>
brewing, infusible or other materials which can be used in the pod include,<br>
without implying any limitation thereto, materials such as tea, coffee, materials<br>
of plant origin such as floral pieces like Jasmine flowers, vegetable pieces like<br>
carrots and onions, materials of animal origin such as honey or any other<br>
suitable beverage powder or material that can be used in the pod.<br>
The brewer sub-assembly of the present invention uses an injection nozzle with<br>
a conical tip which is capable of performing both the functions of puncturing<br>
the porous membrane of the single serving pod as well as injecting the hot<br>
pressurized water from the sealed boiler tank into the interior of the pod<br>
resulting in brewing of the brewing material contained within the pod. The<br>
assembly ensures hygiene by having fully automatic operations with no human<br><br>
intervention and automatic spillage-free disposal of used pods into the disposal<br>
bin.<br>

Description of Invention w.r.t. Drawings<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an assembly for automatic<br>
fresh brewing of hot beverage and dispensing thereof, which automatically<br>
brews the brewing material contained in a single serving pod and dispenses the<br>
hot beverage within a short time of 15 to 20 seconds. The individual servings of<br>
freshly brewed hot beverage are consistent in taste and flavor and are like the<br>
beverage manually prepared at that instant and location. The ready-to-drink<br>
cups of hot beverage dispensed by the assembly are customized to the<br>
consumer's preferences like "strong" , "light", "with milk", "without milk", etc."<br>
in accordance with the input given by selecting switch on the electronic<br>
control panel of the assembly. The assembly of the present invention, being<br>
fully automatic and time-efficient, is specifically, but without implying any<br>
limitation thereto, useful for meeting bulk demands in offices, restaurants,<br>
ceremonial functions, public meetings, etc.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, the assembly of the present invention is housed in a housing<br>
(700), with its front side having a door hinged onto it. An electronic control<br><br>
panel (600) having a plurality of switches like (610), is fitted on to the said<br>
front door of the housing (700). The said switches (610) are internally<br>
connected by electric cables to an electronic processor (500) (Fig.2) housed<br>
inside the housing (700). Each switch (610) corresponds to an option of a<br>
particular type of hot beverage selectable by the operator based on a<br>
consumer's preference, such as "strong", "light", "with milk", "without milk",<br>
etc. Depending upon the consumer's preference for the type of hot beverage<br>
desired by him, the operator or the consumer selects the corresponding switch<br>
(610) on the electronic control panel (600). The signal generated through this<br>
input command is conveyed to the electronic processor (500) (Fig.2) through<br>
connecting electric cables. In accordance with this input command, the<br>
electronic processor (500) (Fig.2) triggers the necessary electrical components<br>
in the individual sub-assemblies, resulting in the automatic dispensing of the<br>
customized hot beverage into a dispensing cup.<br>
An electronic display panel (601) is provided on the front door of the housing<br>
(700). The electronic display panel (601) displays the current functional status<br>
of the assembly like "ready to vend", "currently vending", etc. A dispensing<br>
area is also provided in the front door of the housing (700) for placing the<br>
dispensing cup (19) so that there is direct flow of the brewed liquid from the<br>
brewer chamber (65) (Fig.2) into this dispensing cup (19) through the<br>
dispensing tube (17) (Fig. 2) and also of the heated liquid milk from the milk-<br>
mixing chamber (14) (Fig.2) (when milk is dosed) into this dispensing cup (19)<br>
through the dispensing tube (86) (Fig.2).<br>
A water reservoir (2) is preferably placed outside the housing (700). The water<br>
from the water reservoir (2) is pumped by a water pump (1) (Fig.2) via a tube<br>
(16) and is fed to a sealed boiler tank (3) (Fig.2) via the connecting tube (11)<br><br>
(Fig.2). The upper end of the sealed boiler tank (3) (Fig.2) is connected by tube<br>
(15) to water reservoir (2) through a pressure relief solenoid valve (7) (Fig.2)<br>
which is controlled by pressure sensor (8) (Fig.2).<br>
Referring to Fig.2, the assembly of the present invention inside the said housing<br>
(700) includes water heating sub-assembly (100), a pod-conveyor sub-<br>
assembly (200), a milk input sub-assembly (300), a brewer sub-assembly (400)<br>
and an electronic processor (500). The said electronic processor (500) is<br>
connected by electric cables to the electronic control panel (600) (Fig.1) fitted<br>
on the front door of the said housing (700) (Fig.l). The electronic processor<br>
(500) receives signals from the electronic control panel (600) (Fig.l) through<br>
the inter-connecting electric cables.<br>
The assembly also includes an air-compressor (120), which compresses the air<br>
and pumps such compressed air into the connected compressed air storage<br>
tank (110), which is a hollow metallic cylinder. The compressed air storage tank<br>
(110) is connected to air solenoid valve (83) via connecting tube (117) as well<br>
as to air solenoid valve (115) via connecting tube (116). The said air solenoid<br>
valve (115) is further connected to pneumatic cylinder (61) in brewer sub-<br>
assembly (400) via connecting tube (119). The compressed air from the<br>
compressed air storage tank (110) is used to operate pneumatic cylinder (61)<br>
and venturi valve (81).<br>
Referring to Fig.3, the water heating sub-assembly (100) includes a water<br>
pump (1), which draws water from a water reservoir (2) through a tube (16)<br>
made of food grade material. The water is pumped by the said water pump (1)<br>
into a sealed boiler tank (3) through a connecting tube (11) made of food<br>
grade material. The water reservoir (2) is preferably placed outside the housing<br><br>
(700) (Fig.1). The water in the sealed boiler tank (3) is heated by heating<br>
element (4), which heats the water to a pre-set temperature, controlled by the<br>
temperature sensor (9). The use of a sealed boiler tank (3) makes the assembly<br>
energy-efficient.<br>
Generally, the water in the sealed boiler tank (3) is kept in the temperature<br>
range of 60 to 160 degrees Celsius, preferably in the temperature range of 90<br>
to 140 degrees Celsius. The sealed boiler tank (3) maintains water at high<br>
temperature, without allowing escape of oxygen dissolved in the water, thereby<br>
further improving the quality of the brewed beverage, especially tea. The use of<br>
hot water at high temperature for brewing in the brewer sub-assembly (400)<br>
(Fig.2) also enables quick extraction of the brew. An outlet solenoid valve (5) is<br>
fitted to the sealed boiler tank (3), which enables supply of hot water for<br>
brewing into the brewer sub-assembly (400) (Fig.2) through connecting tube<br>
(70), which is made of food grade material. Another outlet solenoid valve (6) is<br>
provided on the sealed boiler tank (3), which enables supply of steam for<br>
heating milk in the milk-mixing chamber (14) (Fig. 2) through the connecting<br>
tube (13), which is made of food grade material.<br>
The pressure in the sealed boiler tank (3) is sensed by the pressure sensor (8)<br>
and is generally kept in the range of 15 to 45 psi. When the pressure exceeds<br>
the set pressure, a pressure relief solenoid valve (7) provided on the upper side<br>
of the sealed boiler tank (3) is activated with the help of the pressure sensor<br>
(8), which releases the extra pressure from inside the sealed boiler tank (3)<br>
through the tube (15) which enables to maintain the pressure inside the sealed<br>
boiler tank (3) below the set maximum pressure. This protects the sealed boiler<br>
tank (3) against any possibility of excessive pressure buildup inside it. The<br>
sealed boiler tank (3) is also fitted with a pressure gauge (10) for visual<br>
monitoring of the pressure inside the sealed boiler tank (3).<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the pod-conveyor sub-assembly (200) includes a<br>
novel pod-conveyor (31) having an integral shaft (41) from underneath around<br>
the middle portion of its front curvilinear contour. The pod-conveyor (31) is<br>
rotatable on the integral shaft (41) in clockwise and anti-clockwise direction in a<br>
substantially horizontal plane, within the space between a base plate (32) and<br>
chute supporting plate (37). The integral shaft (41) is fitted to the pusher gear<br>
(33) positioned underneath the base plate (32) through a bush (73) mounted<br>
on the base plate (32). The pusher gear (33) is engaged with the motor gear<br>
(35) of the pusher motor (34) so that when the motor gear (35) is rotated by<br>
the pusher motor (34), it results in the rotation of the pusher gear (33) in the<br>
opposite direction. When this happens, it also results in rotation of the pod-<br>
conveyor (31) in the same direction as the pusher gear (33).<br>
The single serving pods (18) containing the brewing material (111) (Fig. 10a,<br>
10b, 10c) are stacked in inverted position in the plurality of static chutes like<br>
chute (36) and chute (38) which are vertical hollow tubes. These chutes are<br>
fitted over the upper surface of a chute supporting plate (37). The chutes (36,<br>
38) extend vertically upwards from the apertures (91, 91) provided on the<br>
chute supporting plate (37). The apertures (91, 91) conform in dimension and<br>
shape to the internal dimensions and shape of the chutes (36, 38). Chutes (36,<br>
38) have one or more vertical slots (46) extending from top to the bottom of<br>
chutes (36, 38) to facilitate loading and stacking of the pods (18) therein.<br>
These chutes (36, 38) are designed to stack therein up to 100 single serving<br>
pods (18) each, in an inverted position with porous membrane (112) (Fig. 10a,<br>
10b, 10c) facing downwards. It is to be noted that the chutes (36, 38) may<br>
have different shapes conforming to the shape of pods (18), which may also<br>
vary in shape (like shown in Fig. 10(a), Fig. 10(b), Fig. 10(c)). For example, the<br>
chutes (36, 38) may have circular cross-section instead of square cross-section,<br><br>
when the pods (18) are circular in shape, instead of being square in shape. The<br>
single serving pods (18) can smoothly move downwards through chutes (36,<br>
38) as well as through the aligned apertures (91, 91) from where these are<br>
conveyed and positioned by the pod-conveyor (31) into the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (400).<br>
A sensor (39) is fixed below the base plate (32) and underneath the chute (36),<br>
which provides signal to the electronic processor (500) (Fig.2) when this chute<br>
(36) is empty, i.e. no pods (18) are remaining therein. When the sensor (39)<br>
senses that chute (36) is empty, the sensor (39) sends a signal to the electronic<br>
processor (500) (Fig.2), which in turn activates pusher motor (34) to cause<br>
pod-conveyor (31) to rotate in a clockwise direction to a position behind chute<br>
(38) till it activates limit switch (48) which sends a signal to the electronic<br>
processor (500) (Fig.2) to stop further clockwise rotational movement of the<br>
pod conveyor (31) by de-activating pusher motor (34).<br>
A sensor (40) is fixed below the base plate (32) and underneath the chute (38),<br>
which provides signal to the electronic processor (500) (Fig.2) when this chute<br>
(38) is empty, i.e. no pods (18) are remaining therein. When the sensor (40)<br>
senses that chute (38) is empty, the sensor (40) sends a signal to the electronic<br>
processor (500) (Fig.2), which in turn activates pusher motor (34) to cause<br>
pod-conveyor (31) to rotate in an anti-clockwise direction. This results in<br>
rotational movement of the inward contour (75) of the pod-conveyor (31) to a<br>
position behind chute (36) till it activates limit switch (52), which sends a signal<br>
to electronic processor (500) (Fig.2), which in turn stops further rotational<br>
movement of pod-conveyor (31) by switching off the power supply to the<br>
pusher motor (34). Simultaneously, the electronic processor (500) (Fig.2) also<br>
halts till refill of the empty chutes (36, 38) with fresh pods (18), of the brewing<br><br>
process in the brewer sub-assembly (400) by switching off power supply to the<br>
air solenoid valve (115) (Fig.2) and also sends a signal to the electronic display<br>
panel (601) (Fig.1) to provide message to the operator to refill chutes (36, 38)<br>
with pods (18). Thus sensor (40) prevents brewing within the assembly when<br>
chute (36) and chute (38) are both empty. The sensors (39, 40) increase the<br>
capability of the assembly to operate with larger number of pods (18) stacked<br>
in plurality of chutes like (36, 38) to meet bulk demands in short time.<br>
It is to be noted that though drawings show an embodiment of the present<br>
invention having two chutes (36, 38) fitted to the chute supporting plate (37)<br>
over the dimensionally aligned apertures (91, 91), however, more number of<br>
such chutes (36, 38) conforming to the shape of pods (18) used, can be<br>
provided and fitted to the chute supporting plate (37) by suitably modifying the<br>
chute supporting plate (37), pod conveyor (31) and the associated components.<br>
A pusher motor (34) is mounted on a motor plate (45) by suitable fixing means<br>
and the motor plate (45) is fixed underneath to the base plate (32) by fixing<br>
means such as four bolts (47, 47, 47, 47). The pod conveyor (31) has a<br>
curvilinear contour which enables its uninterrupted rotation in substantially<br>
horizontal plane in clockwise or anticlockwise direction within the space<br>
between the base plate (32) and the chute supporting plate (37). The forward<br>
end of the pod-conveyor (31) has an inward contour (75), which aligns with the<br>
external contour of the pod (18). Due to this, when this forward end of the<br>
pod-conveyor (31) comes in contact with the pod (18) during anti-clock wise<br>
rotation, it aligns with the external contour of the pod (18), holds the pod (18)<br>
firmly within its inward contour (75), and conveys the pod (18) from the chute<br>
(36 or 38) to the brewer sub-assembly (400), without any guide channel. The<br>
pod-conveyor (31) then precisely positions the pod (18) over the filter disc<br><br>
(63), which is placed on the filter disc holding plate (64) in the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (400). The precise positioning of the pod (18) in the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (400) is enabled by the limit switch (49) as hereinafter described.<br>
The pod-conveyor sub-assembly (200) includes different limit switches (48, 49,<br>
50, 51, 52) which when activated, stop the clockwise or anti-clockwise<br>
rotational movement of the pod-conveyor (31) at specific positions by giving<br>
signal to electronic processor (500) (Fig.2) which in turn switches off the<br>
power supply to the pusher motor (34). The limit switch (49) enables to stop<br>
the further anti-clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (31) after precise<br>
positioning of the pod (18) over the filter disc (63) in the brewer sub-assembly<br>
(400), as shown in Fig. 6(b). The limit switch (50) enables to stop the clockwise<br>
rotation of the pod-conveyor (31) and enables to hold the pod-conveyor (31) at<br>
a position between the chute (36) and the brewer sub-assembly (400) till the<br>
brewing of the brewing material (111) (Fig.10a, 10b, 10c) contained in the pod<br>
(18), is completed, as shown in Fig. 6(c). The limit switch (51) enables to stop<br>
the second anti-clock wise rotation of the pod-conveyor (31) after the used pod<br>
(18) has been disposed off by the pod-conveyor (31) (as shown in Fig.6(d)) to<br>
a disposal bin (79) placed by the side of the brewer sub-assembly (400). The<br>
limit switch (52) enables to stop the second clockwise rotation of the pod-<br>
conveyor (31) when the inward contour (75) of the pod-conveyor (31) reaches<br>
behind chute (36) (as shown in Fig. 6(a)). The limit switch (48) enables to stop<br>
the clock-wise rotation of the pod-conveyor (31) at a position behind chute (38)<br>
when chute (36) is sensed to be empty by the sensor (39). When sensor (40)<br>
detects chute (38) also to be empty, limit switch (52) is activated which enables<br>
to stop the anti-clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (31) after it reaches<br>
back to its rest/start position behind chute (36), as shown in Fig.6(a).<br><br>
Referring to Fig 7, the brewer sub-assembly (400), includes a pneumatic<br>
cylinder (61) with piston rod (71) mounted on a supporting plate (68) with said<br>
piston rod (71) being fitted through the dimensionally aligned circular aperture<br>
(97) on the said supporting plate (68). A brewer plunger (62) is fitted to the<br>
said piston rod (71) of the said pneumatic cylinder (61) from underneath the<br>
said supporting plate (68). The pneumatic cylinder (61) thus being over the<br>
supporting plate (68) whereas brewer plunger (62) being underneath the<br>
supporting plate (68). A perforated non-corrosive food-grade metallic filter disc<br>
(63)	is placed over a filter disc holding plate (64), which rests on three springs<br>
(69) placed between the filter disc holding plate (64) and the brewer chamber<br>
(65). The filter disc holding plate (64) is placed, through a dimensionally<br>
aligned aperture (95) in the base plate (32). The filter disc (63) has very fine<br>
pores up to 250 microns, which prevent miniscule particles of the brewing<br>
material (111) (Fig. 10a, 10b, 10c) from passing through and entering into the<br>
dispensing cup (19) (Fig.2).<br>
The brewer chamber (65) is fixed below the base plate (32) with its top open<br>
end aligned to the aperture (95). The brewer chamber (65), in fixed position, is<br>
also aligned to the brewer plunger (62) such that during the upward and<br>
downward movement of the brewer plunger (62) imparted to it by the piston<br>
rod (71), the brewer plunger (62) is able to move the filter disc holding plate<br>
(64)	along with filter disc (63) and pod (18) placed over it, up and down into<br>
the body of the brewer chamber (65) in a smooth tight-fitting and<br>
uninterrupted manner. A brewer base (66) is detachably fixed to the bottom of<br>
the brewer chamber (65) by a fixing means. An injection nozzle (12) is<br>
detachably and conveniently mounted to the said brewer base (66) by means<br>
of a flange. Due to this, at any point of time, the injection nozzle (12) can be<br>
easily detached for the purposes of cleaning or maintenance. A liquor outlet<br><br>
port (67) for the brewed beverage is provided at the brewer base (66), which<br>
lets the brewed beverage to flow out of the brewer chamber (65) into the<br>
dispensing cup (19) (Fig.2) via the dispensing tube (17) (Fig.2), which is made<br>
of food grade material.<br>
The pneumatic cylinder (61) is connected via connecting tube (119) (Fig.2) to<br>
air solenoid valve (115) (Fig.2), which in turn is connected via connecting tube<br>
(116) (Fig.2) to the compressed air storage tank (110) (Fig.2). The pneumatic<br>
cylinder (61) is operated using compressed air drawn from the said compressed<br>
air storage tank (110) (Fig.2), the flow of which is controlled by the air solenoid<br>
valve (115) (Fig.2). This arrangement enables speedy up and down movements<br>
of the brewer plunger (62) into the brewer chamber (65) during brewing<br>
process which significantly reduces the cycle time per brew.<br>
The injection nozzle (12) is a tube, preferably made of non-corrosive food<br>
grade metallic material such as stainless steel, which is connected to the sealed<br>
boiler tank (3) (Fig.2) through the outlet solenoid valve (5) (Fig.2) via<br>
connecting tube (70) (Fig.2). The said injection nozzle (12) has a conical tip,<br>
which is capable of puncturing the porous membrane (112) (Fig.10a, 10b, 10c)<br>
sealing the contents of the pod (18), when the pod (18) is pressed against the<br>
injection nozzle (12) by the brewer plunger (62) during the downward motion<br>
imparted to it by the piston rod (71). Once the porous membrane (112)<br>
(Fig. 10a, 10b, 10c) of the pod (18) is thus punctured, the conical tip of the<br>
injection nozzle (12) directs the hot pressurized water flowing through its<br>
interior, from the sealed boiler tank (3) (Fig.2), into the interior of the pod (18),<br>
thereby brewing the brewing material (111) (Fig 10a, 10b, 10c) contained<br>
inside the pod (18). The conical tip of the injection nozzle (12) penetrates up to<br>
the top end of the pod (18) kept in inverted position, which results in the<br><br>
splashing back of hot pressurized water inside the pod (18) causing uniform<br>
spread of hot pressurized water in the interior of the pod (18), thereby<br>
thoroughly brewing every minute particle of the brewing material (111) (Fig.<br>
10a, 10b, 10c) contained within the pod (18).<br>
Referring to Fig.8, the milk input sub-assembly (300) is designed to accept<br>
liquid milk from a liquid milk container (85). It includes a venturi valve (81)<br>
having suction tube (84), made of food grade material, which is inserted into<br>
the liquid milk container (85). The venturi valve (81) is also connected to a<br>
milk-mixing chamber (14) by a connecting tube (88) made of food grade<br>
material. The outlet solenoid valve (6) for steam, which has its one end<br>
connected to the sealed boiler tank (3) (Fig.2), has its other end connected to<br>
milk mixing chamber (14) via connecting tube (13), made of food grade<br>
material. The air solenoid valve (83) is connected to compressed air storage<br>
tank (110) (Fig.2) via a connecting tube (117) made of food grade material.<br>
The dispensing tube (86) made of food grade material conveys the heated milk<br>
from the milk mixing chamber (14) into the dispensing cup (19) (Fig.2).<br>
When the air solenoid valve (83) opens, it allows compressed air to flow from<br>
the compressed air storage tank (110) (Fig.2) into the venturi valve (81),<br>
thereby creating a vacuum inside the venturi valve (81), due to which liquid<br>
milk is sucked from the liquid milk container (85) via the suction tube (84) and<br>
is fed into the milk mixing chamber (14) through the connecting tube (88). At<br>
the same time, steam is injected into the milk-mixing chamber (14) from the<br>
sealed boiler tank (3) (Fig.2) through the outlet solenoid valve (6) via<br>
connecting tube (13). This steam heats the milk in the milk-mixing chamber<br>
(14) and the milk thus heated is dispensed through the dispensing tube (86)<br>
into the dispensing cup (19) (Fig.2). An exhaust pipe (87) is provided through<br><br>
the top of the milk-mixing chamber (14) to release the compressed air coming<br>
from the air solenoid valve (83).<br>
Referring to Fig.9, the electronic processor (500) is connected by electric cables<br>
to the electronic control panel (600) provided on the front door of the housing<br>
(700) (Fig.1). The electronic control panel (600) takes input from the operator<br>
of the assembly in regard to the preference of the consumer for the type of hot<br>
beverage desired by him, by operating one of the switches like (610) on the<br>
electronic control panel (600). The electronic control panel (600) sends the<br>
signal to the electronic processor (500) by means of connecting electric cables.<br>
The electronic processor (500) in turn is connected by electric cables to the<br>
electrical components of the other sub-assemblies. The electronic processor<br>
(500) controls the operations of pusher motor (34), outlet solenoid valve (5)<br>
for hot pressurized water, outlet solenoid valve (6) for steam, air solenoid<br>
valve (83), heating element (4), water pump (1) and air solenoid valve (115).<br>
Based on the selection on the electronic control panel (600), the electronic<br>
processor (500) triggers the required electrical components of the other sub-<br>
assemblies in the required sequence, and the assembly automatically brews<br>
and dispenses the desired type of hot beverage into the dispensing cup (19)<br>
(Fig.l).<br>
Referring to Figures 10a, 10b, 10c, the single serving pod (18) is a receptacle<br>
(118) made up of substantially rigid food grade material, containing the<br>
brewing material (111) for the desired beverage. The open side of the<br>
receptacle (118) is covered and sealed with a food grade porous membrane<br>
(112) like filter paper. The sealing of the brewing material (111) contained in<br>
pod (18) by a food grade porous membrane (112) keeps the brewing material<br>
(111) inside the pod (18) in a hygienic manner. The brewing material (111) in<br><br>
the pod (18) is of predetermined quantity, up to 20 grams, preferably in the<br>
range of 0.1 to 12 grams, depending upon the nature of the brewing material<br>
(111).<br>
It is to be noted that the pod (18) may have various embodiments as shown in<br>
Fig.10 (a), Fig.10 (b) and Fig.10 (c). The contents of the pod (18) may be<br>
sealed by any porous membrane (112) material which could be punctured by<br>
the conical tip of the injection nozzle (12) (Fig.7), when pod (18) is pressed<br>
against it during the downward motion of the brewer plunger (62) (Fig.7)<br>
imparted to it by piston rod (71) (Fig.7). The chutes (36, 38) (Fig.2) also need<br>
to be of the shape and dimensions conforming to the shape and dimensions of<br>
the pods (18) so that the pods (18) are stackable therein in the inverted<br>
position, with one pod (18) stacked over the other and with the porous<br>
membrane (112) facing downwards.<br>
Working of the Assembly<br>
Prior to beginning of operation of the assembly, the operator loads pods (18)<br>
into the chutes (36, 38) with the porous membrane (112) of the pod (18)<br>
facing downwards and one pod (18) stacked over the other. The vertical slot<br>
(46) provided in chute (36) and in chute (38) helps the operator to load and<br>
stack the pods (18) in correct alignment within the chutes (36, 38). During this<br>
pod loading operation, the pod conveyor (31) is positioned at its rest or start<br>
position with its inward contour (75) behind chute (36) as shown in Fig. 6(a).<br>
During the loading of chute (36) with pods (18), the lowermost pod (18)<br>
contained therein rests on base plate (32) directly in front of and in alignment<br>
with the inward contour (75) of pod conveyor (31). During the loading of chute<br>
(38) with pods (18), the lowermost pod (18) contained therein rests over the<br>
upper surface of the pod-conveyor (31).<br><br>
In the operation of the assembly, the operator makes the selection of switch<br>
(610) on electronic control panel (600) as per the consumer's preference for<br>
the type of beverage and the input signal through the selected switch is<br>
conveyed by electric cables to the electronic processor (500). The electronic<br>
processor (500) triggers the electrical components of other sub-assemblies in a<br>
definite sequence, according to the selection made. For example: If the<br>
selection is made for "strong tea with milk", then the electronic processor (500)<br>
sends a signal to the sensor (39) to first check for the stock of pods (18) in the<br>
chute (36). In case, chute (36) is not empty i.e. pod (18) is available in this<br>
chute (36), the electronic processor (500) first sends a signal to activate the<br>
pusher motor (34) which in turn rotates the pod-conveyor (31) in an anti-<br>
clockwise direction till the pod (18) is conveyed from the chute (36) and is<br>
precisely positioned over filter disc (63) as shown in Fig. 6(b). At this precise<br>
instant, limit switch (49) gets activated and sends a signal to the electronic<br>
processor (500) which in turn switches off power supply to the pusher motor<br>
(34), thereby stopping further anti-clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (31).<br>
Then, the electronic processor (500) gives signal to pusher motor (34) which<br>
activates clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (31) so as to move the pod-<br>
conveyor (31) away from brewer plunger (62) prior to when the brewer plunger<br>
(62) comes down into the brewer chamber (65) for brewing. The limit switch<br>
(50) is activated when the inward contour (75) of the pod-conveyor (31)<br>
reaches a position between chute (36) and the brewer sub-assembly (400) as<br>
shown in Fig.6(c), which then sends a signal to the electronic processor (500)<br>
which in turn switches off the power supply to the pusher motor (34) thereby<br>
stopping this clockwise rotation of the pod-conveyor (31).<br>
On the other hand, if the sensor (39) returns a 'no stock' signal to the<br>
electronic processor (500), the electronic processor (500) sends a signal to<br><br>
activate the pusher motor (34), which in turn rotates the pod-conveyor (31) in<br>
a clock-wise direction till the inward contour (75) of the pod-conveyor (31)<br>
reaches a position behind chute (38). At this position of the pod-conveyor (31),<br>
the limit switch (48) is activated which sends a signal to the electronic<br>
processor (500) which in turn stops the rotational movement of the pusher<br>
motor (34), thereby stopping the pod-conveyor (31) at this position. When this<br>
happens, and if pod (18) is available within chute (38), the pod (18) contained<br>
within chute (38) which was hitherto held in position within chute (38) resting<br>
over the upper surface of the pod conveyor (31), drops onto the base plate<br>
(32) directly in front of and in alignment with the inward contour (75) of pod<br>
conveyor (31). At this position of pod conveyor (31), the electronic processor<br>
(500) sends a signal to sensor (40) to check for stock of pods (18) in chute<br>
(38). If sensor (40) senses presence of pods (18) in chute (38), with the<br>
lowermost pod (18) in the said chute (38) resting over the base plate (32)<br>
directly in front of and in alignment with the inward contour (75) of pod<br>
conveyor (31), sensor (40) sends a signal to the electronic processor (500)<br>
which activates the pusher motor (34) which in turn rotates the pod-conveyor<br>
(31) in an anti-clockwise direction till pod (18) is conveyed from its position<br>
beneath the chute (38) and is precisely positioned over the filter disc (63) in<br>
the brewer sub-assembly (400) as shown in Fig. 6(b). At this position, limit<br>
switch (49) sends a signal to the electronic processor (500), which in turn stops<br>
further rotational movement of the pod-conveyor (31). Then the electronic<br>
processor (500) gives signal to pusher motor (34) which activates clockwise<br>
rotation of the pod conveyor (31) so as to move the pod conveyor (31) away<br>
from brewer plunger (62) prior to when the brewer plunger (62) comes down<br>
into the brewer chamber (65) for brewing. When the inward contour (75) of the<br>
pod conveyor (31) precisely reaches a position between chute (36) and the<br>
brewer sub-assembly (400) as shown in Fig.6 (c), the limit switch (50) sends a<br><br>
signal to the electronic processor (500) which in turn switches off the power<br>
supply to the pusher motor (34) thereby stopping further clockwise rotation of<br>
the pod conveyor (31).<br>
If the sensor (40) senses that chute (38) is empty, the sensor (40) sends a<br>
signal to the electronic processor (500), which in turn activates the pusher<br>
motor (34) to cause pod-conveyor (31) to rotate in an anti-clockwise direction.<br>
This results in rotational movement of the inward contour (75) of the pod-<br>
conveyor (31) to a position behind chute (36), as shown in Fig. 6(a) till it<br>
activates limit switch (52), which sends a signal to the electronic processor<br>
(500) which in turn stops further rotational movement of pod conveyor (31).<br>
Simultaneously, the electronic processor (500) also halts till refill of the chutes<br>
(36, 38) with pods (18), of the brewing process in the brewer sub-assembly<br>
(400) by switching off power supply to the air solenoid valve (115) and also<br>
sends a signal to the electronic display panel (601) providing message to the<br>
operator to refill chutes (36, 38) with pods (18). Thus sensor (40) prevents<br>
brewing within the assembly when chute (36) and chute (38) are both empty.<br>
On automatic conveying of the pod (18) from either of the chutes (36, 38) and<br>
after positioning of the pod over the filter disc (63) within the brewer sub-<br>
assembly (400), the electronic processor (500) signals to activate the air<br>
solenoid valve (115). This allows the compressed air from the compressed air<br>
storage tank (110) to pass through the connecting tube (116) and also through<br>
the connecting tube (119) into the pneumatic cylinder (61). The compressed<br>
air, which thus enters into the pneumatic cylinder (61), pushes the piston rod<br>
(71) downwards which in turn moves the brewer plunger (62) down into the<br>
brewer chamber (65). The single serving pod (18) which is directly below the<br>
brewer plunger (62) and over the filter disc holding plate (64), thereby moves<br><br>
downward into the brewer chamber (65) along with the brewer plunger (62)<br>
which results in pressing of the porous membrane (112) of the inverted pod<br>
(18) against the conical tip of the injection nozzle (12) resulting in the<br>
puncturing of the porous membrane (112) of the pod (18). After this, the<br>
electronic processor (500) activates the outlet solenoid valve (5), which enables<br>
the hot pressurized water from the sealed boiler tank (3) to pass through the<br>
connecting tube (70) and enter the pod (18) through the interior of the<br>
injection nozzle (12). The conical tip of the injection nozzle (12) penetrates<br>
right up to the top of the inverted pod (18) thereby enabling splashing and<br>
uniform spread of hot pressurized water within the pod (18) through the<br>
injection nozzle (12). The hot pressurized water thus injected into the pod (18)<br>
thoroughly brews every minute particle of the brewing material (111) contained<br>
in the pod (18) and the brewed hot beverage is filtered by the porous<br>
membrane (112) of the pod (18) and filter disc (63), which then flows into the<br>
dispensing cup (19) through the dispensing tube (17).<br>
After the specified time required for brewing is completed, the electronic<br>
processor (500) sends a signal to the outlet solenoid valve (5) to close, thereby<br>
shutting off the supply of hot pressurized water into the injection nozzle (12).<br>
The electronic processor (500) then sends a signal to air solenoid valve (83) to<br>
open, which allows compressed air from compressed air storage tank (110) to<br>
enter the venturi valve (81) which in turn sucks up liquid milk from the liquid<br>
milk container (85) through suction tube (84) and feeds it to the milk-mixing<br>
chamber (14), through connecting tube (88). At the same time the electronic<br>
processor (500) sends a signal to open outlet solenoid valve (6) for steam fitted<br>
to the sealed boiler tank (3), which allows steam to move into the milk-mixing<br>
chamber (14) through connecting tube (13), which heats up the milk in the<br>
milk-mixing chamber (14). The milk thus heated in the milk-mixing chamber<br><br>
(14) gets dispensed through the dispensing tube (86) into the dispensing cup<br>
(19). After the specified time for addition of milk into the dispensing cup (19),<br>
the electronic processor (500) concurrently deactivates the outlet solenoid valve<br>
(6), thereby shutting off the supply of steam from sealed boiler tank (3) to the<br>
milk-mixing chamber (14), as well as shutting off air solenoid valve (83) which<br>
in turn stops the flow of milk from the liquid milk container (85) via venturi<br>
valve (81) into the milk-mixing chamber (14). The addition of heated milk into<br>
the dispensing cup (19) is thus completed.<br>
The electronic processor (500) then deactivates the air solenoid valve (115),<br>
which allows the compressed air inside the pneumatic cylinder (61) to be<br>
released, thereby moving the piston rod (71) along with the brewer plunger<br>
(62) upward. Concurrent to this upward movement of the brewer plunger (62),<br>
the filter disc holding plate (64) along with the filter disc (63) and the used pod<br>
(18) lying over the said filter disc (63), move upwards simultaneously until the<br>
filter disc holding plate (64) returns to its initial rest position, prior to the<br>
brewing process, leaving the used pod (18) on the filter disc (63). The<br>
electronic processor (500) then activates the pusher motor (34) so as to cause<br>
rotational movement of the pod-conveyor (31) in an anti-clockwise direction<br>
pushing the used pod (18) from above the filter disc (63) towards the disposal<br>
bin (79) placed adjacent to the brewer sub-assembly (400). At the precise<br>
position of the inward contour (75) of pod-conveyor (31) when the used pod<br>
(18) falls into the disposal bin (79) (as shown in Fig. 6(d)), the limit switch (51)<br>
is activated and sends a signal to electronic processor (500) which in turn stops<br>
further anti-clockwise rotation of pod-conveyor (31) by switching off power<br>
supply to pusher motor (34). After this, the electronic processor (500) activates<br>
the pusher motor (34) so as to cause rotational movement of the pod-conveyor<br>
(31) in a clockwise direction. This clockwise rotational movement of the pod-<br><br>
conveyor (31) is stopped by the limit switch (52) at the instant when the inward<br>
contour (75) of the pod-conveyor (31) reaches its rest or start position behind<br>
the chute (36) as shown in Fig. 6(a).<br>
