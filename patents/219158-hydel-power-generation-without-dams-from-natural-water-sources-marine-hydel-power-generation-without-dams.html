				<td>The present system of dam based hydel power generation neglects huge water sources like sea as dams in the conventional way cannot be constructed on sea shores. But this invention seeks to conceive the natural water sources like sea as natural dam as such. This becomes possible when an under ground tunnel or pipe line connects the sea to a distant huge land cutting. By this water is directed to the land cutting in such a way that it forcefully rotates the turbine.~f an under ground generator and then water is released to the cutting to be pumped back to the sea either directly or after one more stage of power generation in a second generator pleaced on the sea shore. For this, the water in the land cutting should be first pumped into a massive over head tank and then directed to the second generator. A verient of this model has an array of power generation systems.</td>

Description<br>
Related Application Information (Prior Art)<br>
Presently dams are constructed in suitable places close to rivers and water from it is channeled through tunnels to generators. In this commonly known conventional method, only water from rivers are utilized for power generation and that too in limited quantity. Apart from it, construction of dams are creating problems everywhere like deforestation, spoiling the eco system and creating environmental imbalances leading to problems like earth quakes. There is also the problems associated with the eviction and resettlement of people and the consequent agitations as in the case of Narmada Sarovar Project. Another grave problem associated with the dam based hydel power generation is the scarcity of suitable spots for the construction of dams. Owing to this, major water sources like sea are out of the purview of conventional hydel power generation barring the unconventional experiments like tidal power generation.<br>
Objects of the Invention.<br>
1.	To generate enormous power from the huge water sources available throughout the world.<br>
2.	To keep environmental balance.<br>
3.	To tap the cheapest and most sustainable source of energy.<br>
4.	To bridge the gap between the demand for and supply of power in an environmental friendly way.<br>
5.	To locate the most reliable source of renewable energy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The search for renewable sources of energy has high importance these days as the world is approaching to a point of energy crisis. Each of the conventional source of power generation is strangled with one or other problem. Dam based hydel power generation is not totally dependable on all seasons. Besides, we cannot find out enough spots for construction of dams. Even if suitable spots are located, construction of dams are besetted with so many problems of political and environmental dimensions.<br><br>
In the case of the thermal power stations, environmental pollution is a big problem. Equally important is the high cost of production of electricity in thermal power station. The fact that coal is a non-renewable source of energy also needs special mention.<br>
The case of nuclear power stations is no better. Though massive production of electricity is possible in nuclear power plants, the fact that nuclear waste is hazarduous and pose severe threat to the peaceful existence of man is a cause of worry these days.<br>
When we come to the non-conventional energy sources, what we find is that though most of them are renewable sources, they are not fully dependable owing to a number of reasons. It is a fact that the issues of environmental degradation, national security and economic growth fuel the push toward renewable sources of energy such as wind energy and solar energy. Although pollution free and more affordable, renewable power has its drawbacks. For example, solar energy and wind power suffer from a lack of energy density. Because renewable energy is a very diffuse energy source, large numbers of renewable power generators on large areas of land are required to produce useful amounts of electricity. As a result renewable power facilities tend to be more costly to build on a cost per kw-hour basis under the present scenario. Consequently consumers tend to pay more for the electricity from renewable power sources.<br>
The fact that fossil fuels like petrol and diesel are getting fast depleted is also a thing of worry. The automobile culture of humanity would come to a stand still once the fossil fuels are completely depleted. The alternative for this is electricity. So large scale development of power generation has to shoulder the twin goals of becoming more and more renewable but cheap and an alternative to the fast depleting fossil fuels. The present invention is conventional in the sense that the basic principle of power generation is the same as that of dam based hydel power generation. But unlike the dam based hydel power generation, it is renewable as water is neither destroyed nor wasted away in the course of power generation. This is one of the glittering aspects of this invention.<br>
There is one more thing to be mentioned in this respect. Each day, newer and newer varieties of devices are invented so as to make human life easier, more efficient, more enjoyable, more peaceful and worthier. Almost all these devices function with the help of electricity. So the need and importance of locating worthy ways of generation of electricity has supreme importance. This<br><br>
The inventor of the present invention is frank enough to admit that sonic of the aspects of the present invention may appear to be crude at first sight. For instance one of the components of Marine Hydel Power Generation is the pumping out of sea water used for power generation from a huge (in dimensions of length, width and depth) land cutting back to the sea. It may at first seem to be unattractive. But when we compare with this the positive factor of converting an ocean into a natural dam, the negative factor would become something like the black spot upon the sun!<br>

Function<br>
Water from the sea (A) is channeled through the slopping tunnel/pipe line (B) and sent to the first generator (C 1). After power generation, water is released to the land cutting (D) and then carried to an overhead tank (L) through pipeline (G) and sent to the second generator (C2) through the slopping pipe (H) from the overhead tank (L) and after power generation, the water is released to the sea.<br><br>
A method of power generation using sea water, said method comprises discharging of water through slopping tunnel or pipeline to the land cutting or area which is below sea level; waterflow makes the turbine to rotate which is connected to the generator for power generation ; a pumping system is used to pump the water from low level area to a high level area tank; the water from the tank is discharged through a pipe line to the sea where a turbine is placed to generate power<br>
The present invention seeks to convert natural water sources into natural dams so that hydel power generation acquairs new dimensions. The present system of hydel power generation is defective in the sense that it cannot utilize the full potentials of power generation offered by the aplenty natural water sources like sea. As a result though 2/3 portion of the earth is covered by water, a lion share of it is presently out of the purview of hydel power generation.<br>
By converting the huge natural water sources like sea into natural dams, we can enter into an era of converting the conventional power generation systems, which in all cases are non-renewable in nature into a renewable one.The basic principle of the present discovery is the same as in the case of the present day dam based hydel power generation. However there are some fundamental differences too. Both underground and over ground power generation are conceived in the invention. Water from sea is channeled to the land cutting and power is generated in the which has its turbine positioned in the tunnel or pipeline. Then water is collected in a huge overhead tank in the land area and then water from its bottom is channeled through huge slopping pipeline to another generator placed on the seashore. The water forcefully coming through the slopping pipeline rotates its turbine and thus power is generated. The water after power generation can be directly released to the sea.<br>
There is a variant of two stage power generation. This is the method of arranging an array of two stage power generation systems either by having an array of underground tunnels or pipe lines starting from the sea to a massive cutting having enough length. Another is to have an array of over head tanks and pumping facilities of water and second stage generators (placed on the sea shore) which have turbines positioned in the pipe line coming from the bottom of the overhead tanks. In the case of the former, two stage power is generated in all units resorting to vigorous redirecting of water from the land cutting to the overhead tanks. In the case of the latter, power is generated only in the second generators except the first unit (main unit) having connection to sea and having underground power generation system.<br><br>
There are variety of options in the matter of pumping of water from the land cutting. One is to use human power or cattle power to draw water from the land cutting and taking it to a considerable height above ground and then let the water flow to the sea via slopping pipe line to sea. In this case, lakhs of people can be employed in different shifts in large scale power projects based on the present invention. This is an innovative venture to redress the burning problem of the unemployed too. Instread of drawing water in the crude form suitable other devises supplementing human labour to pull water out of the land cutting can also be resorted to. But these are only optional if the entire power generated has to be given to the distribuition line. But using iunnovative water pulling techniques of low power consumption, the water from the land cutting can be cleared of in a more efficient manner.<br>

Function<br>
Water from the sea (A) is channeled through the slopping tunnel/pipe line (B) and sent to the first generator (C 1). After power generation, water is colleted in the land cutting (D) This model can be used for one way power generation as well in the peak load period, when the land cutting is large enough to collect the sea water. In this method, a separate pumping system is not required since the generator will act as pump in the non-peak load period with the help of external power supply. The pumped water can be discharged directly to sea or it can be stored in an our head tank from which the water is discharged for power generation. Thus the value of power used to pump the water can be generated through this process \*^tCH can also be said as two way power generation system.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I claim,<br>
1 A method of power generation using sea water, said method comprises discharging of water through slopping tunnel or pipeline to the land cutting or area which is below sea level; waterflow makes the turbine to rotate which is connected to the generator for power generation ; a pumping system is used to pump the water from low level area to a high level area tank; the water from the tank is discharged through a pipe line to the sea where a turbine is placed to generate power<br>
