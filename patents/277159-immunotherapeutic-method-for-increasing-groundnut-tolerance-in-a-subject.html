 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new immunotherapeutic methods for increasing tolerance to groundnut in a subject. Particularly, the present invention discloses the use of a skin patch device for progressive desensitization of a subject to groundnut.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Peanut allergy is one of the most common and serious of the immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods in terms oi persistence and severity of reaction. In fact, this allergy is estimated to be involved in the majority of fatal and near-fatal food-related anaphylaxis in all age groups. The prevalence of this allergy has doubled in the last decade and it now affects between 0,6% and 1,2% of the general population (Sicherer et al., 2003).<br>
This allergy tends to present early in life and only 20% of allergic children become tolerant to peanut (Skolnick et al., 2001). Sensitization generally occurs in the gastrointestinal tract but can also occur as a consequence of direct or cross-sensitization by inhalation exposure to peanut or cross-reactive environmental antigens such as pollen.<br>
The allergic reaction provoked by peanuts is strictly an IgE mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction. The IgE-allergen complex causes mast cell receptors to cross-link inducing a signal transduction cascade that ends in degranulation and release of a variety of mediators that give rise to the clinical symptoms of peanut hypersensitivity.<br>
The major peanut allergens are seed storage proteins. Although 9 peanut allergens, namely Ara h 1 to Ara h 9, have been reported (Burks et al., 1992; Burks et al., 1991; Rabjohn et al., 1999; Koppelman et al., 2005; Mittag et al., 2004; Becker et al., 2001, Lauer et al., 2008), Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 3 are classified as the major peanut<br>
 <br>
allergens because they are generally recognized by more than 50% of peanut-allergic patients (Koppelman et al., 2001).<br>
Preventive treatment of this allergy consists of avoidance, which is very difficult because of the widespread and often disguised use of peanuts in the food industry. Current pharmacotherapies (antihistamines and corticosteroids) can be used to reduce the symptoms of allergic disease but do not prevent allergic reaction.<br>
Immunotherapy is the only available treatment that can modify the natural course of the allergic disease, by reducing sensitivity to allergens. For immunotherapy, a dose of an allergen is given in order to progressively induce an immune response characterized by tolerance to the antigen/allergen, also known as desensitization. This method is particularly indicated for patients with severe allergic IgE-dependent reactions.<br>
Even though immunotherapy has been in practice for more than 90 years, the exact mechanism of its action is still not clear. In humans, it involves (i) an increase of IgG, in particular IgG4 which is a blocking antibody that may block IgE mediated mechanisms by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils, (ii) an increase of regulatory T cells (Treg) leading to a better balance of the Th2 / Thl profile, and (iii) the production of T cells producing IL-10, also known as human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF), which counteracts the inflammatory effect of mast cells and promotes the production of IgG4.<br>
Until now, the immunotherapy could be administered by subcutaneous, sublingual or intra-nasal routes.<br>
Subcutaneous immunotherapy is the most common treatment used by allergists. Nevertheless, this method is quite expensive and requires a specialized practitioner for each injection. A major drawback of subcutaneous immunotherapy is its allergic side effects. These side effects can be either local or systemic. Groundnut allergy<br>
 <br>
immunotherapies using subcutaneous route have been demonstrated to induce a high rate of adverse systemic reaction (up to 50%) (Nelson et al., 1997 and Oppenheimer et al., 1992). Systemic side effects are caused by allergen inadvertently being injected into small subcutaneous blood vessels, or allergens diffusing into the subcutaneous blood vessels. Allergens may be transported to other organs such as the lung or distant sites of the skin, where they can provoke asthma or hives. They also may cause anaphylaxis which can result in death. Consequently, allergies with high anaphylaxis risks, such as peanut allergy, cannot be treated by subcutaneous route.<br>
Sublingual immunotherapy was accepted by WHO as a valid alternative to the subcutaneous route and should be used in all patients who require immunotherapy and do not accept the subcutaneous route of allergen administration. However, the dose of allergen required for sublingual immunotherapy is greater than subcutaneous immunotherapy and this method sometimes induces some local adverse effects such as oral pruritus, throat irritation, swelling of tongue or throat.<br>
Intra-nasal immunotherapy is another alternative to the subcutaneous route which has been proven to be efficient for seasonal rhinitis and asthma treatment (Hufnagl et al., 2008). Nevertheless, this route is generally not well tolerated by patients and most of them prematurely interrupt their treatment (Pajno et al., 2005).<br>
Consequently, there is a need for an immunotherapy method for groundnut allergy treatment which is safe, efficient and well tolerated by patients.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a new method of immunotherapy to groundnut allergies. More specifically, the invention shows, for the first time, that efficient immunotherapy of groundnut allergies can be achieved through the epicutaneous route.<br>
 <br>
The present invention provides a new immunotherapeutic method for increasing tolerance in a subject to groundnut, which comprises repeatedly administering to said subject one or more proteins derived from groundnut via the epicutaneous route by means of a skin patch device comprising a backing, the periphery of said backing being adapted to create with the skin a hermetically closed chamber, wherein the backing bears on its skin facing side within the chamber said one or more proteins in a dose sufficient to induce an immune reaction in said subject following application of the patch device to the skin, said one or more proteins being removed from the backing following application of the patch device to the skin and thereafter delivered to the subject via the epicutaneous route, said administration leading, on repetition, to a progressive increase in tolerance in the subject to groundnut.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention concerns a skin patch device comprising a backing, the periphery of said backing being adapted to create with the skin a hermetically closed chamber, wherein the backing bears on its skin facing side within the chamber one or more proteins derived from groundnut in a dose sufficient to induce an immune reaction in a subject following application of the patch device to the skin, said one or more proteins derived from groundnut being removed from the backing following application of the patch device to the skin and thereafter delivered to the subject via the epicutaneous route.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention also concerns (the use of) a skin patch device comprising a backing, the periphery of said backing being adapted to create with the skin a hermetically closed chamber, wherein the backing bears on its skin facing side within the chamber one or more proteins derived from groundnut in a dose sufficient to induce an immune reaction in a subject following application of the patch device to the skin, said one or more proteins derived from groundnut being removed from the backing following application of the patch device to the skin and thereafter delivered to the subject via the epicutaneous route, (in the manufacture of a composition) for increasing tolerance in a subject to groundnut.<br>
 <br>
In another aspect, the present invention also concerns a patch kit comprising a plurality of skin patch devices, each of said devices comprising a backing, the periphery of said backing being adapted to create with the skin a hermetically closed chamber, wherein the backing bears on its skin facing side within the chamber one or more proteins derived from groundnut in a dose sufficient to induce an immune reaction in a subject following application of the patch device to the skin, said one or more proteins derived from groundnut being removed from the backing following application of the patch device to the skin and thereafter delivered to the subject via the epicutaneous route. The different patches of the kit may contain the same or a different amount of groundnut allergen thus making it possible to maintain or to increase/ decrease the allergen doses over the course of the immunotherapeutic method of the invention.<br>
The invention may be used in any subject, particularly any human subject, including children and adults. Preferably, the subject is allergic to groundnuts.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an immunotherapeutic method for increasing groundnut tolerance in a subject using epicutaneous administration. This method is particularly safe for the patient considering that allergens have not been shown to cross the skin into the bloodstream. This approach could thus prevent severe allergic patients from the important risk of systemic or anaphylactic reactions during the immunotherapy protocol. Furthermore, the results obtained by the inventors show-that desensitisation to groundnuts through the epicutaneous route according to this invention is at least as efficient as desensitisation using other routes of administration, in particular intradermal route.<br>
In particular, the present invention shows that a specific immune reaction provoked by the skin application of groundnut allergens according to this invention induces a modification of the immune system oi the subject and leads to a progressive increase in tolerance in the subject to groundnut.<br>
The immunotherapeutic method of the invention involves the administration of a groundnut allergen composition to a subject via the epicutaneous route using particular patch devices, leading to tolerance.<br>
As used in this specification, the term "epicutaneous route" means the administration of an allergen to a subject by application of this allergen on the skin. The epicutaneous route does not require the use of a needle, syringe or of any other means to perforate or to alter the integrity of the superficial layer of the epidermis. The allergen is maintained in contact with the skin for period of time and under conditions sufficient to allow the allergen to penetrate into the stratum corneum of the epidermis. This diffusion induces the migration and the activation of Langerhans cells thereby promoting an immune reaction.<br>
 <br>
The term "tolerance" is here defined as a reduction in immunological reactivity of a subject towards specific allergens/ herein groundnut allergens.<br>
As used in this specification, the term "groundnut" or "peanut" means a species in the legume family Fabaceae, for example Arachis. Peanuts are also known as earthnuts, goobers, goober peas, pindas, jack nuts, pinders, manila nuts and monkey nuts.<br>
As used in the present specification, the term "groundnut allergen" refers to any protein or peptide derived from groundnut which is capable of evoking an allergic reaction. This allergen may be selected from natural or native allergens, modified natural allergens, synthetic allergens, recombinant allergens, allergoids, and mixtures or combinations thereof. Preferably, selected allergens are capable of causing an IgE-mediated immediate type hypersensitivity. The terms "polypeptide", "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is a modified residue, or a non-naturally occurring residue, such as an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers.<br>
In the present specification, the term "protein derived from groundnut" refers to any protein which can be obtained from groundnut or which comprises a portion or a sequence of a protein obtainable from groundnut. In a particular embodiment, the protein is selected from seed storage proteins. Preferably, the protein is selected from Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 4, Ara h 5, Ara h 6, Ara h 7, Ara h 8 and Ara h 9 from Arachis hypogaea. In a most preferred embodiment, the protein derived from groundnut comprises at least Ara h 1, Ara h 2 or Ara h 3 or their isoforms. The amino acid sequences oi Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3 are known to the skilled person. As an illustration, the Genbank accession numbers of Ara h 1 protein, two Ara h 2 isoforms and two Ara h 3 isoforms are, respectively, AAL27476, AAM78596, AAN77576, AAT39430 and AAC63045. These proteins can be obtained from a<br>
 <br>
groundnut extract or produced by a recombinant organism, such as genetically modified bacteria, yeasts or by any other methods known by the man skilled in the art. These proteins can be used in combination or separately. It should be understood that the term "protein derived from groundnut" also includes fragments or variants of the above antigens, such as epitope-containing fragments, or proteins obtained from groundnut and subsequently enzymatically, chemically, mechanically or thermally modified.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition comprises one or more proteins derived from groundnut.<br>
In another embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition comprises one or more proteins derived from groundnut selected from Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3, optionally in combination with others proteins derived from groundnut.<br>
In another embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition comprises a groundnut extract as a source of proteins derived from groundnut.<br>
A groundnut extract designates any preparation (lysate, filtrate, homogenate etc..) obtained from groundnut. The groundnut extract can be used directly or groundnut allergens can be at least partially purified from this extract. This purification process can involve filtration, centrifugation, precipitation or any other techniques known by the skilled person. Preferably, proteins derived from groundnut and administered to the subject are at least partially purified.<br>
In one embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition is in a liquid form, such as a solution or a dispersion of particles. In that case, effective epicutaneous administration is ensured by migration of the allergen from the liquid phase of the allergen composition to the skin in order to allow the allergen to penetrate into the stratum corneum of the epidermis. In a particular embodiment, the migration of the allergen from the liquid phase of the allergen composition is ensured by diffusion of<br>
 <br>
the allergen through the condensation formed within the hermetically closed chamber, e.g. as a result of perspiration.<br>
In another embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition is in a dry form, in particular in a particulate form, obtained, for example, by lyophilisation. The present invention indeed shows that an efficient tolerance to groundnut can be achieved using a groundnut allergen preparation in a solid (e.g., dry) form. The use of proteins in particulate form is advantageous. Indeed, such particulate allergens may be directly attached to the backing of the device, thereby avoiding any chemical interaction or any reaction which might disturb the immunogenicity of these proteins. Moreover, the use of the particles allows preserving the substance in a suitable packaging, such that there is no longer any need to carry out an extemporaneous preparation. In this case, the epicutaneous administration of groundnut allergens held on the backing of the patch may be ensured by dissolution of these allergens in the condensation formed within the hermetically closed chamber.<br>
In each embodiment, the condensation present within the hermetically closed chamber may come from condensed perspiration secreted by skin.<br>
As used herein, the term "perspiration", "sweating" or "transpiration" means the production of a fluid that is excreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals. This fluid contains mainly water but also various dissolved minerals and trace elements. In the present invention, perspiration secreted by the skin evaporates and condenses within the hermetically closed chamber.<br>
The term "condensation" refers, in this specification, to the change of the physical state of matter from gaseous phase into liquid phase, particularly the change of evaporated perspiration into liquid phase. The condensation formed by the perspiration within the chamber following application of the patch device to the skin causes or enhances removal and epicutaneous delivery of the allergens. In fact, the<br>
 <br>
allergens may be dissolved in the water contained in the condensed perspiration and thereafter delivered to the subject via the epicutaneous route.<br>
The allergen composition may further comprise additional components, such as adjuvants.<br>
In an embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition used in the present invention is formulated without any adjuvant. The invention indeed shows that groundnut immunotherapy can be accomplished through the epicutaneous route without the need tor additional adjuvant.<br>
In another embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition used in the present invention comprises or is applied with an adjuvant. Within the context of this invention, an adjuvant designates any substance that acts to activate, accelerate, prolong, or enhance antigen-specific immune responses when used in combination with specific antigen. Adjuvant compounds that can be used in combination with groundnut allergens include mineral salts, such as calcium phosphate, aluminium phosphate, and aluminium hydroxide; immunostimulatory DNA or RNA, such as CpG oligonucleotides; proteins, such as antibodies or Toll-like receptor binding proteins; saponins e.g. QS21; cytokines; muramyl dipeptide derivatives; LPS; MPL and derivatives including 3D-MPL; GM-CSF (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor); imiquimod; colloidal particles; complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant; Ribi's adjuvant or bacterial toxin e.g. cholera toxin or enterotoxin (LT). In a particular embodiment, the groundnut allergen composition is formulated with enterotoxin.<br>
The skin patch device used in the method of the invention comprises a backing, the periphery of said backing being adapted to create with the skin a hermetically closed chamber. This backing bears on its skin facing side within the chamber the groundnut allergen composition used to induce an immune reaction.<br>
 <br>
The term "hermetically closed chamber" as used in the present specification, means that the backing of the patch is moisture impervious and that the periphery of this backing constitutes an occlusive barrier thereby defining an enclosed space. The moisture impermeability of this chamber is required to allow allergens being removed from the backing, e.g., by dissolution or extraction, through the effect of moisture within said chamber and thereafter being delivered to the subject. The effectiveness of the patch is greatly conditioned by the creation of this liquid phase, in which the allergen is in solution or in suspension, thus promoting its passage through the pores.<br>
The term "moisture" as used in the present specification, means the presence of water or other liquid in either the liquid or vapour phase.<br>
Preferably, the periphery of the backing has adhesive properties and forms an airtight joint to create with the skin a hermetically closed chamber.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the groundnut allergens are maintained on the backing by means of electrostatic and/or Van der Waals forces. This embodiment is particularly suited where the groundnut allergens are in solid form (e.g., particles), although it may also be used, indirectly, where the allergens are in a liquid form.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the term "electrostatic force" generally designates any non-covalent force involving electric charges. The term Van der Waals forces designates non-covalent forces created between the surface of the backing and the solid allergen, and may be of three kinds: permanent dipoles forces, induced dipoles forces, and London-Van der Waals forces. Electrostatic forces and Van der Waals forces may act separately or together.<br>
In this respect, in a preferred embodiment, the patch device comprises an electrostatic backing. As used herein, the expression "electrostatic backing" denotes any backing made of a material capable of accumulating electrostatic charges and/or<br>
 <br>
generating Van der Waals forces, for example, by rubbing, heating or ionization, and of conserving such charges. The electrostatic backing typically includes a surface with space charges, which may be dispersed uniformly or not. The charges that appear on one side or the other of the surface of the backing may be positive or negative, depending on the material constituting said backing, and on the method used to create the charges. In all cases, the positive or negative charges distributed over the surface of the backing cause forces of attraction on conducting or nonconducting materials, thereby allowing to maintain the allergen. The particles also may be ionized, thereby causing the same type of electrostatic forces of attraction between the particles and the backing.<br>
Examples of materials suitable to provide electrostatic backings are glass or a polymer chosen from the group comprising cellulose plastics (CA, CP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylen terephtalate (PET), polyvinyl chlorides (PVCs), polypropylenes, polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polyacrylics, in particular poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and fluoropolymers (PTFE for example). The foregoing list is in no way limiting.<br>
The back of the backing may be covered with a label which may be peeled off just before application. This label makes it possible, for instance, to store the groundnut allergen in the dark when the backing is at least partially translucent.<br>
The intensity of the force between a surface and a particle can be enhanced or lowered by the presence of a thin water film due to the presence of moisture. Generally, the patch is made and kept in a dry place. The moisture shall be low enough to allow the active ingredient to be conserved. The moisture rate can be regulated in order to get the maximum adhesion forces.<br>
As discussed above, the use of an electrostatic backing is particularly advantageous where the allergen is in a dry form, e.g., in the form of particles. Furthermore, the particle size may be adjusted by the skilled person to improve the efficiency of<br>
 <br>
electrostatic and/or Van der Waals forces, to maintain particles on the support. Preferably, the size of the particles is in the range of 1 to 60 micrometers.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the patch comprises a polymeric or metal or metal coated polymeric backing and the particles of groundnut allergens are maintained on the backing essentially by means of Van der Waals forces. Preferably, to maintain particles on the support by Van der Waals forces, the average size of the particles is lower than 60 micrometers.<br>
In another embodiment, the groundnut allergens are maintained on the backing by means of an adhesive coating on the backing. The backing can be completely covered with adhesive material or only in part. Different occlusive backings can be used such as polyethylene or PET films coated with aluminium, or PE, PVC, or PET foams with an adhesive layer (acrylic, silicone, etc.).<br>
Groundnut allergen composition in particulate form can be loaded on the backing by means of a spray-drying process, such as an electrospray process as described in the French patent application n°08 50406. An electrospray device uses high voltage to disperse a liquid in the fine aerosol. Allergens dissolved in a solvent are then pulverized on the patch backing where the solvent evaporates, leaving allergens in particles form. The solvent may be, for instance, water or ethanol, according to the desired evaporation time. Other solvents may be chosen by the skilled person. This type of process to apply substances on patch backing allows nano-sized and mono-sized particles with a regular and uniform repartition of particles on the backing. This technique is adapted to any type oi patch such as patch with backing comprising insulating polymer, doped polymer or polymer recovered with conductive layer. Preferably, the backing comprises a conductive material.<br>
In another embodiment, the periphery of the backing is covered with a dry hydrophilic polymer, capable of forming an adhesive hydrogel film by contact with the moistured skin (as described in the French patent application n°07 57970). In this<br>
 <br>
embodiment, the skin has to be moistured before the application of the patch. When the hydrogel comes into contact with the moistured skin, the polymer particles absorb the liquid and become adhesive, thereby creating a hermetically closed chamber when the patch is applied on the skin. Examples of such hydrogels include polyvinylpyrolidone, polyacrylate of Na, copolymer ether methyl vinyl and maleic anhydride.<br>
In another particular embodiment, the liquid groundnut allergen composition is held on the support of the patch in a reservoir of absorbent material. The composition may consist in an allergen solution or in a dispersion of the allergens, for example in glycerine. The adsorbent material can be made, for example, of cellulose acetate.<br>
The backing may be rigid or flexible, may or may not be hydrophilic, and may or may not be translucent, depending on the constituent material. In the case of glass, the support may be made break-resistant by bonding a sheet of plastic to the glass.<br>
In one embodiment, the backing of the patch contains a transparent zone allowing directly observing and controlling the inflammatory reaction, without necessarily having to remove the patch. Suitable transparent materials include polyethylene film, polyester (polyethylene-terephtalate) film, polycarbonate and every transparent or translucent biocompatible film or material.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the portion of the backing bearing the allergen is not in direct contact with the skin. In this embodiment, the height of the chamber defined by the backing, the periphery of the backing and the skin is in the range of 0,1 mm to lmm.<br>
The method of the invention typically involves the repeated administration of one or more groundnut allergens to the subject as disclosed above, leading to a progressive increase in tolerance in the subject.<br>
 <br>
The specific dose of allergen as well as the number of applications and duration of contact can be adapted by the skilled artisan, depending on the subject, the nature of the allergen preparation, the type of patch device used, etc.<br>
Generally, the method comprises the application of at least two patch devices as disclosed above, preferably at least 3, 5,10 or 15, over a period of time comprised between a week and years. The treatment may be stopped at any time, e.g., once an effective tolerance has been established.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the invention involves the repeated application of 1 to 4 patches per day, at least once a week, over a period of 1 month to several years. In a preferred embodiment, the method of the invention involves the application of 1 patch per day, every day or at least once a week, over a period of 1 month to several years. The duration of contact of the patch with the skin for each application is in the range of 1 to 24 hours, preferably around 8 hours.<br>
The amount of groundnut allergens on each patch is typically in the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/cm2 of patch surface, preferably in the range of 20 to 500 ng/cm2 of patch surface, more preferably in the range of 20 to 200 µg/cm2 of patch surface. The patch surface is in the range of 1 cm2 to 10 cm2, preferably in the range of 1 cm2 to 5 cm2.<br>
For application, the patch devices may be applied directly to the skin, without any pre-treatment, preferably on a hairless part of the body. Alternatively, the skin may be treated prior to application of the device, to disrupt the stratum corneum, to remove hairs or simply to cause hydration of the skin, at the site of contact with the patch device. To efficiently increase the tolerance of the subject to groundnuts, groundnut allergens are preferably administered in a dose sufficient to induce an immune reaction in the subject.<br>
This immune reaction can involve an inflammatory reaction leading to a cascade of biochemical events involving the local vascular system and the immune system.<br>
 <br>
Inflammatory reaction is either moderate in the form of erythema (first clinical element of the inflammatory reaction), or in the form of a papula also indicating the presence of local edema (another component of the inflammatory reaction). The inflammatory reaction induced by the application of groundnut allergens via the epicutaneous route can be visible or non visible to the unaided eye.<br>
As disclosed in the experimental section, the method of the invention results in a reduction of specific IgE levels and an increase in some specific IgG levels, in particular in IgG4 levels, leading to a progressive increase in tolerance to groundnut. The term "specific Ig" refers herein to immunoglobulins which are specific to at least one allergen to which the subject is allergic. In a preferred embodiment, these immunoglobulins are specific to at least one protein derived from groundnut, especially Ara h 1, Ara h 2 or Ara h 3 or their isoforms.<br>
The method of the invention also leads to an immune deviation from a dominant Th2 profile to a more balanced Thl/Th2 profile. In other words, the method of the invention causes a raising of a Thl response to the proteins administered. Thl and Th2 cells are two types of CD4+ helper T-cells which differ in their pattern of cytokines production. Thl cells produce IFN-y, IL-2 and TNF-p and are involved in cell-mediated immune responses that are beneficial in host-defence against intracellular pathogens and malignant cells, but detrimental in mediating autoimmunity. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13, which increase antibody responses, including IgE production, and protect against parasitic infestations but can also cause allergy and asthma. Thl and Th2 responses are mutually antagonistic, such that they normally exist in equilibrium and cross-regulate each other. In allergic subject, the balance Thl/Th2 is altered and the Th2 profile is predominant. An immune deviation from dominant Th2 profile to a more balanced Thl/Th2 profile means a deviation from an allergic state to a tolerant state. This deviation, mediated by an increase of Treg cells, can be evaluated by any method known by the skilled person, such as a decrease in ratio IgGl/IgG4 or the analysis of cytokine production.<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method of the invention is free of systemic effects. An inflammatory reaction is likely to be observed on the skin of the subject only at the site of the epicutaneous administration or in the direct periphery of this site. This inflammatory reaction can be modulated by the dose of allergen laid on the backing.<br>
The present invention also provides a skin patch device, as described above, comprising a backing, the periphery of said backing being adapted to create with the skin a hermetically closed chamber, wherein the backing bears on its skin facing side within the chamber one or more groundnut allergens, as described in the present specification, in a dose sufficient to induce an immune reaction in the skin of a subject following application of the patch device to the skin, said one or more allergens being removed from the backing following application of the patch device to the skin and thereafter delivered to the subject via the epicutaneous route.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of a skin patch device as described above, in the manufacture of a composition for increasing tolerance to groundnut in a subject allergic to groundnut.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of a skin patch device as described above, in the manufacture of a composition for increasing a Thl-type immune response to groundnut in a subject allergic to groundnut.<br>
The present invention also relates to a patch kit comprising a plurality of patches as described above, the patches of the kit containing the same or a different amount of groundnut allergen. Also, the allergen composition used on the patches of the kit can be the same or different. For example, different groundnut proteins can be used, with or without adjuvant. Preferably, the same composition is used over the course of the desensitization treatment.<br>
The following examples are given for purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation.<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Methods<br>
Animals and protein extracts<br>
Four-week-old female BALB/c mice purchased from Charles River Laboratories (France) were sensitized to peanut proteins. The use of BALB/c mice as murine model of sensitization to peanut proteins was described in Adel-Patient et al., 2005. This model should reproduce the IgE fine specificity and the symptoms as observed in allergic humans upon challenge. All experiments were performed according to European Community rules of animal care.<br>
Peanut extract was prepared by mixing peanut powder (Allergon, Sweden) in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 M NaCl during 4 hours at room temperature. After centrifugation, supernatant was kept as peanut protein extract (PPE). PPE was then dialysed and protein content was quantified by BCA assay and analysed by SDS PAGE. Endotoxin levels were below 0,06 µ g/ml (E-toxate kit, Sigma, France).<br>
Protocol of sensitization<br>
Eight BALB/c mice received 1 mg of homogenized PPE mixed with 10 ug of Cholera Toxin (CT) on days 1, 6,12,18, 24, 30 by means of intra-gastric gavages. Sera were collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus on days 0,18 and 43, centrifuged, and the samples were stored at -20°C until further assays. Naive mice were bled on the same days (n=8). Sensitization was monitored by biological parameters as defined above.<br>
Protocol of desensitization<br>
Desensitization was perfomed once a week during 8 and 16 weeks via epicutaneous (EP) route as follow:<br>
Mice were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine and xylazine and shaved with an electric clipper and depilatory cream. The day after, skin patch devices with<br>
 <br>
a backing bearing 100 ug of PPE in dry form, the periphery of said backing being adapted to create with the skin of the mouse a hermetically closed chamber, were placed on the back of the mouse and maintained by a bandage for 48 hours.<br>
Allergen challenge and quantification of histamine release<br>
Mice were fasted overnight and challenged with intragastric gavage with PPE of 10 mg per mouse divided into 2 doses at 30 minutes intervals. Naive mice were challenged in the same manner. To determine plasma histamine levels, blood was collected 30 minutes after the second intragastric gavage challenge and stored at -20°C until analyzed. Histamine levels were determined by using an enzyme immuno-assay kit (SPI-BIO, France) as described by the manufacturer.<br>
Quantification of specific IgE, IgGl, IgG2a<br>
Blood samples were collected from retro-orbital venous plexus before and during immunotherapy and the plasma were stored at -30°C until further analyses. A quantitative ELISA, validated using ICH guidelines, was used for specific IgE, IgGl and IgG2a. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with PPE act at a concentration of 10 ug/ml. Serial dilutions of 100 µl of each serum were dispensed per well and incubated for 24 h at 4°C. An anti-mouse IgGl or IgG2a antibody labelled with phosphatase alkaline (Serotec, England) was used as a tracer. Reagent (pNPP) (Sigma, France) was used as an enzyme substrate. Specific IgE, IgGl and IgG2a were quantified by comparison with concentration-response curves obtained with a total IgE, IgGl or IgG2a assay performed under identical conditions using a solid phase coated with an anti-mouse IgE, IgG or IgG2a antibody (Serotec, England) instead of peanut proteins, which is complementary to tracers. Mouse immunoglobulin standards were obtained from Serotec.<br>
IgA assay<br>
Specific IgA were determined on sera samples. Sera (1/50) diluted in PBS buffer containing 0,1% BSA were incubated on plates coated with PPE at 10 µg.mR Specific IgA were detected using goat anti-mouse IgA (Southern Biotechnology<br>
 <br>
Associated, USA) labelled with phosphatase alkaline and detected as above. Results are reported as absorbance units at 405 nm.<br>
Cytokine production<br>
After the last blood sampling, mice were killed by vertebral dislocation and spleens were harvested under sterile conditions. Cell culture were performed in the presence of PPE (2.5 - 250 µg.ml-1), PBS (negative control) or concanavalin A (1 µg.ml-1, positive control). IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFNy and TGFJβ were assayed using CytoSetTM kits (BioSource International Europe, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Delayed-type hypersensitivity response (DTH)<br>
To elicit a DTH response, mice were challenged after the last oral immunization by an injection of 100 |ig peanut protein in PBS into the hind footpad. PBS was injected in the other footpad. Net swelling of the both footpad was measured using a microcalliper 24 h after challenge and was compared each other.<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
The Graph Pad Software (San Diego, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Data were analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's test when comparing treated mice with controls, or using ANOVA and Tukey's test when comparing all the groups with each other.<br>
Results<br>
Preliminary remarks<br>
The understanding of the immune system in mice and in human and the study of their similarities and differences in mechanisms such as Thl and Th2 responses are still going on. In order to assess the model which has been developed as a proof of concept of epicutaneous immunotherapy, some elements about the main allergic<br>
 <br>
biomarkers and their interpretation in human and mouse are provided, especially<br>
concerning the balance Thl/Th2.<br>
Degranulation of mast cells: In human, IgE is the only immunoglobulin isotype that<br>
directly triggers the degranulation of mast cells and subsequent manifestation of<br>
anaphylaxis, whereas in mouse, degranulation of mast cells is triggered by IgGl<br>
together with IgE.<br>
Production of IgG antibodies: In human, the production of IgG antibodies, primarily<br>
the IgG4 subtype, can antagonize and 'block' the allergic inflammation cascade<br>
resulting from antigen recognition by IgE. In mouse, equivalent antibodies are not<br>
described and the switch from Th2 to Thl profile consists of the increase of IgG2a<br>
antibody.<br>
In human, the production of IgE and IgG4 is stimulated in Th2 cells whereas the<br>
production of IgGl and IgG3 is stimulated in Thl cells.<br>
In mouse, the production of IgE and IgGl is stimulated in Th2 cells whereas the<br>
production of IgG2a and IgG3 is stimulated in Thl cells.<br>
To sum up, in murine model, the efficacy of immunotherapy was essentially assessed by the increase of specific IgG2a.<br>
1. Validation of sensitisation<br>
1.1	Specific IgE, IgGl, IgG2a during sensitization<br>
PPE specific antibodies induced in BALB/c mice after administration of PPE by gavage were analyzed. Peanut-sensitization in mice was marked by a production of specific IgE and IgGl as shown in figure 1. IgG2a was also produced but at to a lesser extent than specific IgGl. No specific antibodies could be detected in naive<br>
mice.<br>
1.2	Cytokines secreted after in vitro reactivation of splenocytes<br>
Splenocytes from mice sensitized with CT plus PPE secreted high quantities of allergen-specific IL-4 and IL-5, and small amounts of IL-10, IFNy and TGFp (figure<br>
 <br>
2). No cytokine was found in control mice. These results demonstrated that the PPE-specific Th2 response was induced in BALB/c mice receiving peanut proteins by means of gavage.<br>
1.3	Histamine levels after oral challenge<br>
Because histamine increased levels reflect mast cell degranulation and is one of the major mediators of anaphylactic reaction, histamine was assayed in plasma after oral challenge. Histamine was detectable only in plasma sample from sensitized mice (figure 3).<br>
1.4	Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTH)<br>
To complete the previous results showing the sensitization of mice to peanut proteins, the DTH response was investigated. A footpad challenge was performed at the end of sensitization and demonstrated a swelling only for sensitized mice (figure 4). No DTH response was found in footpad treated with PBS.<br>
2. Peanut Immunotherapy<br>
2.1	Formulation for immunotherapy<br>
Protein content of the formulation used for immunotherapy was characterized by SDS-PAGE (figure 5).<br>
2.2	Specific IgE, IgGl, IgG2a during immunotherapy<br>
IgE and IgGl: Peanut sensitization was particularly characterized by a production of specific IgE and IgGl. During immunotherapy, the evolution of specific antibodies was monitored. As shown in figure 6, the production of specific IgE was stabilized during 8 and 16 weeks of desensitization. The decrease of specific IgE is a long term process which can be observed only after some months. Furthermore, during the immunotherapy, no modification of specific IgGl was observed (data not shown).<br>
 <br>
gG2a: specific IgG2a significantly increased for treated mice after 8 weeks and 16<br>
veeks of desensitization (figure 7).<br>
"o confirm the immune deviation from a dominant Th2 profile to a balanced Th2/Thl profile, the ratio IgGl/IgG2a was evaluated for each group: EP desensitization, NT and control (figure 8). The ratio IgGl/IgG2a decreased only for treated mice showing a boosting of Thl profile in order to obtain a more balanced Th2 / Thl profile.<br>
2.3	Histamine<br>
Histamine is one of the major mediators of anaphylactic reaction. Histamine was assayed in plasma samples collected 30 minutes after oral challenges as a marker of the degranulation of mast cells. After 16 weeks of desensitization, the histamine release was quantified for mice of each group (treated or not) (figure 9). Mice treated epicutaneously with PPE showed a significantly lower release of histamine. This result confirmed an improvement of the allergic status of mice.<br>
2.4	Specific IgA during immunotherapy<br>
Titration of specific IgA was performed on serum samples after 8 weeks of desensitization (figure 10). Specific IgA were significantly increased in mice treated by epicutaneous route with PPE after 8 weeks of desensitization. No modification was observed in non treated mice. Specific IgA was not detectable in control mice. Specific IgA is described as having a similar action as IgG4 during immunotherapy. Its immunomodulatory effect could lead to IL-10 production and TGFp expression (Francis etal., 2008).<br>
Conclusion<br>
Epicutaneous route displays potent and original way of desensitization on peanut-sensitized mice.<br>
Epicutaneous desensitization led to an immune deviation from a dominant Th2 profile to a rebalanced Th2/Thl profile and increased specific IgA. As a marker of<br>
 <br>
allergenicity (degranulation of mast cells), histamine release was decreased in mice treated by epicutaneous route.<br>
