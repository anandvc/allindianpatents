				<td>AMINO ACID AND PEPTIDE CONJUGATES OF ARYLALKYLIC ACIDS FOR COSMETIC USE<br>
The present invention is directed to amino acid- or peptide conjugates with short chain Arylalkyl carboxylic acids and to compositions containing them. The compositions are preferably cosmetic preparations. It was found that the specific peptide or amino acid conjugates in particular the conjugates with phenylbutyric acid are particularly useful for treating wrinkles but also for thickening the epidermis, repairing the skins lipid barrier, for protection against hair loss and for improving hair growth.<br>
Human skin undergoes certain normal cornification processes which give the skin its characteristic appearance. Casual factors or external factors such as a raw climate, wind, photo-damage and irritation triggered by the sun, rain and snow, however, disturb this normal condition of the skin, and there appears a roughness, a formation of scales (for example on the scalp), an excessive keratinization and similar phenomena. Furthermore, in the course of aging of the skin various signs appear that are especially reflected by a change in the structure and function of the skin. One of these signs is the appearance of fine lines and deep wrinkles, the size and number of which increases with age. The microrelief of the skin becomes less uniform and is of unisotropic nature. In parallel with age the skin becomes more sensitive towards disturbing influences, either intrinsic or extrinsic, which may result in itch, redness or even darker spots, particular on hands and the facial area due to pigmentation disorders. These unwanted signs may lead to an undesired age judgment of a person.<br>
Cosmetic preparations are essentially useful for skin care. One aim of skin care in the cosmetic sense is to strengthen or rebuild the skin's natural function as a barrier against environmental influences (e.g. UV-light, dirt, chemicals, microorganisms) and against the loss of endogenous substances (e.g. water, natural lipids, electrolytes). If this function becomes impaired, increased resorption of toxic or allergenic substances or attack by microorganisms may result, leading to toxic or allergic skin reactions.<br>
Another aim of skin care is to compensate for the loss by the skin of lipids and water caused by daily washing. This is particularly important, if the natural regeneration ability is<br>
inadequate. Furthermore, skin care products should protect against environmental influences, in particular against sun and wind, and delay skin aging.<br>
Strengthening or thickening of the epidermis together with an optimized skin barrier lipid synthesis can rebuild the skin's barrier ability and is therefore of significant cosmetic value. Reduced transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is a sign of an intact lipid barrier, which acts also as first defense line to protect against the appearance of skin wrinkles.<br>
Another strategy to fight wrinkles is to stimulate the collagen synthesis in the dermis. A number of degenerative processes act on the collagen matrix and is triggered by extrinsic factors like UV radiation, pollution in general and particular cigarette smoke or intrinsic factors leading to any chronic or subchronic inflammation. Destruction and/or impaired repair efficacy leads to a denser and less elastic macro structure of the dermis, which in turn leads to the formation of deep wrinkles. Enhancing the de novo synthesis of collagen or other structural proteins of the dermis is considered a valuable therapy to reduce the existing wrinkles and to protect against the appearance of new wrinkles.<br>
Of particular importance for anti-aging cosmetics is to inhibit the senescence of skin cells in order to keep their regular metabolic level on a constant and beneficial level.<br>
Hair loss or alopecia is a common affliction of humans. The most common form of hair loss in both males and females is patterned baldness or androgenic alopecia.<br>
Hair follicles range in size from small, superficial, vellus follicles to large, deep, terminal follicles. The cyclic growth phases of hair follicles are telogen (resting), anagen l-lll (developing), anagen IV-VI (growing) and catagen (involuting).<br>
In the development of androgenic alopecia there is the gradual diminution of follicle size, with conversion of large, terminal follicles, producing thick, pigmented hair fibers (terminal hair) to small vellus follicles producing fine, non-pigmented hair fibers (vellus hair). In addition, the proportion of growing anagen follicles declines.<br>
There exists a wide variety of literature regarding cosmetic preparations, in particular regarding cosmetic preparations for treating wrinkles and for promoting hair growth. As<br>
examples of the extensive literature it can be referred e.g. to GB 906,000, EP-A 699 429 or WO 03/086342.<br>
WO 98/17273 discloses butyric acid derivatives for protecting against hair loss particularly in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Various butyric acid derivatives are mentioned, but the document does not disclose any peptide or amino acid conjugates of those acids.<br>
EP 1297830 discloses various alpha- or beta-amino acid derivatives for prevention and treatment of tissue damage by ozone; however the document is silent in terms of amides at the alpha or beta-nitrogen atom with aryl containing carboxylic acids.<br>
WO 00/15188 reports about specific peptides for the healing, hydrating and improving skin appearance as well as treatment of skin aging. For enhancing the lipophilicity the N-terminal amine is supposed to carry a fatty acid chain with 2 to 22 carbons. Aromatic carboxylic acids are not mentioned. The fatty acid residue should make the molecule more lipophilic.<br>
EP 0864563 discloses the use of N-Acyl-hydroxyamino acid esters for protection of skin and hair by designing biomimetic compounds of ceramids. Ceramids contribute significantly to the skin lipid barrier and require at two longchain fatty acid one of them having preferentially more than 16 carbon atoms. The document does not disclose amides with aryi-containing carboxylic acids.<br>
EP 1159952 suggest cosmetics containing Hydroxyproline or acylated Hydroxyproline. The document does not disclose aromatic carboxylic acids derivatives of amino acids or peptides.<br>
US 5492894 discloses compositions with tripeptides up to hexapeptides to treat skin wrinkles. The peptides can optionally be modified by various substitution patterns at N- as well as the C-terminus. Arylalkoyl residues at the N-terminus are not disclosed.<br>
While a variety of technologies exist to prevent and to fight the signs of skin aging, to improve the appearance of the skin or to treat or prevent hair loss, there is still a demand for more efficacious ingredients.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is the provision of novel compounds, of compositions containing these novel compounds, in particular of cosmetic preparations which are particularly useful for treating and/or preventing wrinkles, thickening of the epidermis, and preventing and/or treating of hair loss, but also preparations which are useful against other conditions which are observed with skin aging due to environmental or other external influences or due to age. The new compounds should have an activity which is comparable to the activity of known cosmetically active compounds but preferably is better than the activity of the prior art compounds.<br>
This problem is solved on the basis of the unexpected finding that certain phenylalkyl carboxylic derivatives, namely the peptide or amino acid conjugates thereof, show activity in cosmetic applications and related pharmaceutical applications, in particular for treating and preventing wrinkles and hair loss and thickening the epidermis, but also for ameliorating the effects of aging of the skin, which may be caused by external or environmental hazards or by the natural aging of the skin.<br>

Assessment of accelerated hair growth and protection hair growth<br>
The ability of the compounds and compositions of the present invention to stimulate or protect hair growth can be investigated with a mouse model described for example in WO 9817273. Instead of using Cyclophosphamide (Neostar, Pharmacia) to damage hair follicle Mitomycin, or Methotrexate can be used. It is also possible to detect hair growth acceleration with newborn mice. They have a synchronized hair cycle and approximately after 3 weeks all hair follicles go into the telogen phase. Then the animals are treated and it is evaluated how fast and to what extend the hair is growing. Similar tests using in vitro or in vivo setups can also be found in J. Invest. Dermato. symposium proceedings 3rd Int. Meeting of Hair Research Societies, 8/1, p.39 - 45 (2003).<br>
It also is possible to perform a clinical study including males suffering from alopecia using the TrichoScan analysis tool described in R. Hoffmann, J. Invest. Dermato. symposium proceedings 3rd Int. Meeting of Hair Research Societies, 8/1, p.109-115 (2003),<br><br><br><br><br><br>
