17p-HYDR0XYSTER0ID DEHYDROGENASE TYPE 3 INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANDROGEN DEPENDENT DISEASES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application number<br>
60/317,715, filed 6 September 2001.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel inhibitors of Type 3 17p- Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and the use of the compounds for the treatment or prevention of androgen dependent diseases.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Androgen dependent diseases, i.e. diseases whose onset or progress is aided by androgenic activity, are well known. These diseases include but are not limited to prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, precocious puberty, adrenal hyperlasia and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Estrogen dependent diseases, i.e. diseases whose onset or progress is aided by estrogenic activity are also well known. These include but are not limited to breast cancer, endometriosis, leiomyoma and precocious puberty.<br>
Androgenic and estrogenic activity may be suppressed by administering androgen receptor antagonists or estrogen receptor antagonists respectively. See e.g. WO 94/26767 and WO 96/26201. Androgenic and estrogenic activity may also be reduced by suppressing androgen or estrogen biosynthesis using inhibitors of enzymes that catalyze one or more steps of such biosynthesis. Type 3 17(3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (17p-HSD3) is the primary enzyme that converts androstenedione to testosterone in the testes. Androgenic and estrogenic activity may also be reduced by suppressing ovarian or testicular secretions by known methods. See e.g. WO 90/10462, WO 91/00731, WO 91/00733, and WO 86/01105. Type 5 17B-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase is described in WO 97/11162. Novel<br><br>
inhibitors of both Type 3 and Type 5 17B-Hyroxysteroid Dehydrogenase are described in WO 99/46279.<br>
US Pat. No. 5,665,735 discloses compounds useful in the treatment of asthma, allergy and inflammation, which are of the formula:<br><br><br><br><br>
in the ring structure,<br>
T represents CH, C or N.<br>
Current therapies for the treatment of androgenic and estrogenic dependent diseases include the use of glucocorticoids to block adrenal secretions, and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists which cause medical castration. Both therapies are associated with undesirable side effects. An improved therapy would include compounds that specifically inhibit type 3 17(3-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, while avoiding inhibition of other 17p-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Such an improvement is provided by this invention.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Unless where indicated otherwise, the following definitions apply throughout the present specification and claims. These definitions apply regardless of whether a<br><br>
term is used by itself or in combination with other terms. Hence the definition of "alkyl" applies to "alkyl" as well as to the "alkyl" portions of "alkoxy", etc.<br>
Unless otherwise known, stated or shown to be to the contrary, the point of attachment for a multiple term substituent (multiple terms that are combined to identify a single moiety) to a subject structure is through the last named term of the multiple term. For example, a cycloalkylalkyl substituent attaches to a targeted through the latter "alkyl" portion of the substituent (e.g., Structure-alkyl-cycloalkyl).<br>
When any variable (e.g., aryl, R2) occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
Unless stated, shown or otherwise known to be the contrary, all atoms illustrated in chemical formulas for covalent compounds possess normal valencies. Thus, hydrogen atoms, double bonds, triple bonds and ring structures need not be expressly depicted in a general chemical formula.<br>
Double bonds, where appropriate, may be represented by the presence of parentheses around an atom in a chemical formula. For example, a carbonyl functionality, -CO-, may also be represented in a chemical formula by -C(O)- or -C(=0)-. Similarly, a double bond between a sulfur atom and an oxygen atom may be represented in a chemical formula by -SO-, -S(O)- or -S(=0)-. One skilled in the art will be able to determine the presence or absence of double (and triple bonds) in a covalently-bonded molecule. For instance, it is readily recognized that a carboxyl functionality may be represented by -COOH, -C(0)OH, -C(=0)OH or -C02H.<br>
The term "substituted," as used herein, means the replacement of one or more atoms or radicals, usually hydrogen atoms, in a given structure with an atom or radical selected from a specified group. In the situations where more than one atom or radical may be replaced with a substituent selected from the same specified group, the substituents may be, unless otherwise specified, either the same or different at every position. Radicals of specified groups, such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl and heteroaryl groups, independently of or together with one another, may be substituents on any of the specified groups, unless otherwise indicated.<br><br>
"Alkyl" represents a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain having the designated number of carbon atoms. Preferrably the number of carbon atoms is 1 to 20, more preferrably 1 to 10, most preferrably the number of carbon atoms is 1 to 6. Where the number of carbon atoms is not specified, 1 to 20 carbons are intended. "Lower alkyl" represents a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "chemically-feasible" is usually applied to a ring structure present in a compound and means that the ring structure would be expected to be stable by a skilled artisan.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" or "cycloalkane," as used herein, means an unsubstituted or substituted, saturated, stable, non-aromatic, chemically-feasible carbocyclic ring, having, preferably, from three to fifteen carbon atoms, more preferably, from three to eight carbon atoms. The cycloalkyl carbon ring radical is saturated and may be fused, for example, benzofused, with one to two cycloalkyl, aromatic, heterocyclic or heteroaromatic rings. The cycloalkyl may be attached at any endocyclic carbon atom that results in a stable structure. Preferred carbocyclic rings have from five to six carbons. Examples of cycloalkyl radicals include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.<br>
The term "heterocycloalkyl" refers to a cycloalkyl group which has at least one heteroatom.<br>
The term "halogen" or "Halo" (halogen) is intended to include fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>

The term "aryloxy" as used herein, means an oxygen atom bonded to an aryl group (-O-aryl).<br>
The term "fluoroalkyl" represents a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain having the designated number of carbon atoms, substituted with one or more fluorine atoms. Where the number of carbon atoms is not specified, 1 to 20 carbons are intended.<br><br>
"Aryl" refers to a mono- or bicyclic ring system having one or two aromatic rings including, but not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, indenyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, anthracenyl, fluorenyl and the like. The aryl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three substituents independently selected from lower alkyl, halo, cyano, nitro, haloalkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, carboxyalkyl, carboxamide, mercapto, sulfhydryl, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, sulfonyl, sulfonamido, aryl and heteroaryl.<br>
The term "arylakyl" refers to an aryl group bonded directly to a subject structure through an alkyl group.<br>
The term "heteroatom," as used herein, means a nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen atom. Multiple heteroatoms in the same group may be the same or different.<br>
The term "heteroalkyl" refers to an alkyl group which has at least one heteroatom.<br>
The term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclic ring" is defined by all non-aromatic, heterocyclic rings of 3-7 atoms containing 1-3 heteroatoms selected from N, O and S, such as oxirane, oxetane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, tetrahydropyridine, tetrahydropyrimidine, tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiopyran, morpholine, hydantoin, valerolactam, pyrrolidinone, and the like.<br>
The term "heterocyclic acidic functional group" is intended to include groups such as, pyrrole, imidazole, triazole, tetrazole, and the like.<br>

N-oxides can form on a tertiary nitrogen present in an R substituent, or on =N-in a heteroaryl ring substituent and are included in the compounds of formula I.<br><br>
The term "prodrug," as used herein, represents compounds that are drug precursors which, following administration to a patient, release the drug in vivo via a chemical or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to a physiological pH or through an enzyme action is converted to the desired drug form). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of A.C.S. Symposium Series (1987), and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, E.B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Ass'n and Pergamon Press (1987), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

The phrase "effective amount," as used herein, means an amount of a compound or composition which is sufficient enough to significantly and positively modify the symptoms and/or conditions to be treated (e.g., provide a positive clinical response). The effective amount of an active ingredient for use in a pharmaceutical composition will vary with the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy, the particular active ingredient(s) being employed, the particular pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient(s) / carrier(s) utilized, and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the attending physician.<br>
As used herein the term "disease" is intended to include any abnormal physical or mental condition, including disorders, as well as any symptoms which are subject evidence of a disease or disorder.<br>
The term "compound having the formula I", and the like as used herein, represents a compound having a chemical structure encompassed by formula I, and includes any and all isomers (e.g., enantiomers, stereoisomers, diastereomers, rotomers, tautomers) and prodrugs of the compound. These compounds can be neutral, acidic or alkaline, and further include their corresponding pharmaceutically-acceptable salts, solvates, esters, and the like.<br><br>
All isomers of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The definition of compounds according to the invention embraces all the possible isomers and their mixtures.  It very particularly embraces the racemic forms and the isolated optical isomers having the specified activity. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives or separation by chiral column chromatography. Unless noted otherwise, inventive compounds designated with a 1 or 2 above the formula correspond to the first and second isomers, respectively, to elute from a chiral chromatography column during separation from a diastereomeric mixture.<br>

Microtubule affecting agents useful in the invention are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to allocolchicine (NSC 406042), Halichondrin B (NSC 609395), colchicine (NSC 757), colchicine derivatives (e.g., NSC 33410), dolastatin 10 (NSC 376128), maytansine (NSC 153858), rhizoxin (NSC 332598), paclitaxel (Taxol®, NSC 125973), Taxol® derivatives (e.g., derivatives (e.g., NSC 608832), thiocolchicine (NSC 361792), trityl cysteine (NSC 83265), vinblastine sulfate (NSC 49842), vincristine sulfate (NSC 67574), epothilone A, epothilone, and discodermolide (see Service, (1996) Science, 274:2009) estramustine, nocodazole,<br><br>
MAP4, and the like. Examples of such agents are also described in the scientific and patent literature, see, e.g., Bulinski (1997) J. Cell Sci. 110:3055-3064; Panda (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:10560-10564; Muhlradt (1997) Cancer Res. 57:3344-3346; Nicolaou (1997) Nature 387:268-272; Vasquez (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:973-985; Panda (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271:29807-29812.<br>
Particularly preferred microtubule affecting agents are compounds with paclitaxel-like activity. These include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives (paclitaxel-like compounds) and analogues. Paclitaxel and its derivatives are available commercially. In addition, methods of making paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives and analogues are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos: 5,569,729; 5,565,478; 5,530,020; 5,527,924; 5,508,447; 5,489,589; 5,488,116; 5,484,809; 5,478,854; 5,478,736; 5,475,120; 5,468,769; 5,461,169; 5,440,057; 5,422,364; 5,411,984; 5,405,972; and 5,296,506).<br>
More specifically, the term "paclitaxel" as used herein refers to the drug commercially available as Taxol®(NSC number: 125973). Taxol® inhibits eukaryotic cell replication by enhancing polymerization of tubulin moieties into stabilized microtubule bundles that are unable to reorganize into the proper structures for mitosis. Of the many available chemotherapeutic drugs, paclitaxel has generated interest because of its efficacy in clinical trials against drug-refractory tumors, including ovarian and mammary gland tumors (Hawkins (1992) Oncology, 6: 17-23, Horwitz (1992) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 13: 134-146, Rowinsky (1990) J. Natl. Cane. Inst. 82: 1247-1259).<br>
Additional microtubule affecting agents can be assessed using one of many such assays known in the art, e.g., a semiautomated assay which measures the tubulin-polymerizing activity of paclitaxel analogs in combination with a cellular assay to measure the potential of these compounds to block cells in mitosis (see Lopes (1997) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 41:37-47).<br>
Generally, activity of a test compound is determined by contacting a cell with that compound and determining whether or not the cell cycle is disrupted, in particular, through the inhibition of a mitotic event. Such inhibition may be mediated by disruption of the mitotic apparatus, e.g., disruption of normal spindle formation. Cells<br><br>
in which mitosis is interrupted may be characterized by altered morphology (e.g., microtubule compaction, increased chromosome number, etc.).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, compounds with possible tubulin polymerization activity are screened in vitro. The compounds are screened against cultured WR21 cells (derived from line 69-2 wap-ras mice) for inhibition of proliferation and/or for altered cellular morphology, in particular for microtubule compaction. In vivo screening of positive-testing compounds can then be performed using nude mice bearing the WR21 tumor cells. Detailed protocols for this screening method are described by Porter (1995) Lab. Anim. ScL, 45(2): 145-150.<br>
Other methods of screening compounds for desired activity are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically, these involve assays for inhibition of microtubule assembly and/or disassembly. Assays for microtubule assembly are described, for example, by Gaskin et al. (1974) J. Molec. Biol., 89: 737-758. U.S. Patent No. 5,569,720 also provides in vitro and in vivo assays for compounds with paclitaxel-like activity.<br>
Methods for the safe and effective administration of the above-mentioned microtubule affecting agents are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, their administration is described in the standard literature. For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the "Physicians' Desk Reference" (PDR), e.g., 1996 edition (Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ 07645-1742, USA.<br>

BIOLOGICAL DATA 17B-hvdroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibition data Methods:<br>
To prepare human recombinant type 3 17p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme (17p-HSD3), HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human 17(3-HSD type 3 were cultured to confluency and harvested for enzyme. The cells were suspended in isolation buffer (20 mM KH2P04, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M Sucrose, 1 mM PMSF, 5 ^ig/ml pepstatin A, 5 jig/ml antipain and 5 jig/ml leupeptin) to a concentration between 5.0 x 106 and 1.0 x 107 cells/ml. The cells were sonicated on ice using a micro-ultrasonic cell disrupter at an output setting of No. 40 for four 10 second bursts. The broken cells were then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min at 4°C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended, aliquoted into microfuge tubes, and stored at -80°C.<br>
To measure conversion of 14C-androstenedione to 14C-testosterone, which occurs primarily through the enzymatic action of 17p-HSD3, reaction buffer (12.5 mM KH2P04, 1 mM EDTA), NADPH cofactor (1 mM final), test compound, 17p-HSD3 enzyme (30^ig protein) and 14C-androstenedione substrate (100 nM; 2.7 nCi/tube) were added to 13 x 100 borosilicate glass tubes to a total volume of 0.5 mL/tube. The tubes were placed in a prewarmed 37°C water bath for 30 minutes. The reaction was then stopped by adding 1 ml of ethyl ether. The tubes were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm at 4°C in a table top centrifuge and then snap frozen in a dry ice-methanol bath. The ether layer was decanted into another glass tube, and then evaporated to dryness using compressed nitrogen gas. The samples were resuspended in chloroform (20 mL) and spotted onto silica G60 thin layer<br><br>
chromatography plates. 14C-Androstenedione substrate and 14C-testosterone product were separated by placing the plates in chlorofornrethyl acetate (3:1). The plates were dried, exposed overnight, scanned and quantitated on a FUJI FLA2000 phosphorimager.<br>
The percent inhibition of 17p-HSD3 activity is the difference between the percent of maximum specific binding ("MSB") and 100%. The percent of MSB is defined by the following equation, wherein "dpm" represents "disintegrations per minute":<br>
°/ M9R =      (dpm of unknown)" (dPm of nonspecific binding) (dpm of total binding) - (dpm of nonspecific binding)<br>
The concentration at which a compound having formula I produces 50% inhibition of binding is then used to determine an inhibition constant ("Ki") using the Chang-Prusoff equation.<br>
It will be recognized that the compounds having formula I can inhibit 17p-HSD3 to varying degrees. The compounds useful for practice of the invention exhibit potent affinities to bind 17p-HSD3 as measured by Ki values (in nM). The activities (potencies) for these compounds are determined by measuring their Ki values. The smaller the Ki value, the more active is a compound for inhibiting a particular NK enzyme.<br>
Compounds of this invention have a range of 17B-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 3 binding activity from about 0.005 nM to about &gt; 100 nM. Preferably, compounds of this invention have a binding activity in the range of about 0.005 nM to 100 nM, more preferably about 0.005 to 50 nM, and even more preferably about 0.005 nM to 10 nM. Yet even more preferred compounds have a binding activity in the range of about 0.005 nM to 0.050 nM.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g., magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets,<br><br>
powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pennsylvania.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.<br>
Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal composition can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably, the compound is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br>
The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 0.01 mg to about 750 mg, more preferably from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg, and most preferably from about 0.01 mg to about 250 mg, according to the particular application.<br>
The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the<br><br>
proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of formula (I) will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the disease being treated. A dosage regimen of the compound of formula (I) can be oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day, preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, more preferably 50 to 600 mg/day, in two to four (preferably two) divided doses. Intermittant therapy (e.g., one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks) may also be used.<br>
The chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be administered in association with the compounds of the present invention according to the dosage and administration schedule listed in the product information sheet of the approved agents, in the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) as well as therapeutic protocols well known in the art. Table 1.0 below gives ranges of dosage and dosage regimens of some exemplary chemotherapeutic agents useful in the methods of the present invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy can be varied depending on the disease being treated and the known effects of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy on that disease.
