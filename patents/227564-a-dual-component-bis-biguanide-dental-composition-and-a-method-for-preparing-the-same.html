				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a dual component bis-biguanide dental composition exhibiting reduced staining to teeth and particularly, to a dual component dentifrice composition containing a bis-biguanide compound which achieves plaque reduction with substantially less staining of teeth than normally occurs with bis-biguanide compound containing dentifrices.<br>
2. The Prior Art<br>
Denuil plaque is a soft deposit which forms on teeth and is comprised of an accumulation of bacteria and bacterial by-products. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity, e.g.. on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line and the like. Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and otn"-forms of periodoiual disease.<br>
A wide variety of antibacterial agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infection and dental disease associated with plaque formation. For example, bis-biguanide compounds such as chlorhexidine are well known to the art fpjiiheir antibacterial activity and have been used in oral compositions to counter plaque formalion by bacterial accumulation in ihe oral cavity. However, it is also well known that bis-biguanide compounds, when used as dental antiplaque agents cause unsightly staining of teeth. Many procedures have been proposed by the art to reduce such tooth staining: US Patent Nos. 3.925,543, 3,934,002, 3,937,807, 4,051,234, 4,080,441,4,256,931, 4,273,759 and 4,886,658.<br>
WO 94/12150 discloses an oral hygiene composition containing an antibacterial effective amount of resin and an antimicrobial effective amount of antimicrobial ager.l such as chloi'hexidine. WO 97/46462 discloses a duaJ chambered container for physically segregation at least two dentifrice compositions which contain interactive ingredients.<br>
However, the presence of bis-biguanide compound in dentifrice compositions containing<br>
Conventional ingredients such as abrasives, anionic surfactants and flavorants which are Necessary for adequate cleaning and payability of the dentifrice, these ingredients are normally incompatible with bis-biguanide compounds, and tend to diminish the bioavailability of such compounds necessary for antiplaque efficacy.<br>
There is a clear need in the art to formulate a dentifrice product capable of delivering a bis-biguanide antibacterial agent whereby the other ingredients used to prepare the dentifrice composition do not inhibit the bioavailability of the bis-biguanide compound concomitant with limited tooth staining caused by the compound.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention encompasses a dual component dental composition which when applied to teeth contains a combination of a bis-biguanide compound, an abrasive and other ingredients normally incompatible with the bis-biguanide compound whereby reduction of plaque is accomplished during tooth brushing with substantially less staining of teeth that normally accompanies the use of dental compositions containing bis-biguanide compounds<br>
The present invention is based upon the discovey that when a separately maintained bis-biguanide compound containing dental gel component which is free of anionic surfactant and abrasive ingredients and a second abrasive containing dentifrice component, which abrasive is normally incompatible with the bis-biguanide component are simultaneously combined and thereafter applied to the surface of the teeth, an undiminished antiplaque efficacy is unexpectedly obtained with limited staining of teeth when the teeth are brushed with the combined components.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a dual component dental composition of the present invention is provided which is comprised of separate bis-biguanide compound containing gel and an alumina abrasive containing paste components which are housed in a container wherein the components are maintained separate from each other and are not combined and admixed until simultaneous application to teeth is to be performed by the user as by brushing<br>
Unexpectedly, when the separately maintained gel paste components are contacted with each Other immediately prior to application to teeth, the ingredients contained in these dental components do not appreciably immediately react 10 inactivate the antiplaque efficacy of the bis-biguanide compound, thereby allowing the bis-biguanide compound in its full efficacious form, to be applied to the teeth simultaneously with a dentifrice component containing a normally incompatible tooth cleaning abrasive material.<br>

To prepare the bis-biguanide compound containing gel component of the present invention, the humectant and thickener are dispersed in a conventional mixer. Chlorhexidene, a polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymer and color are added and mixed for 30 minutes. The mixture is transferred to a vacuum mixer and mixed for 20-40 minutes under a vacuum mixer in the range of 5 to 100 millimeter of mercury pressure, preferably 5 to 20 mm Hg, providing a homogeneous mixture. The nonionic surfactant and flavor are then added to the mixture which is followed by mixing another 10 to 20 minutes under vacuum of 5 to 50 mm Hg   The resultant product is a non-fluid gel.<br>
To prepare the abrasive containing dentifrice component of the present invention, the humectant and thickener are dispersed in a conventional mixer until the mixture becomes a slurry which is smooth in appearance, after which water is added. This mixture is heated to 100-100°F and mixed for 10 to 30 minutes producing a homogeneous gel phase   Sweetener and color are added and mixed for 20 minutes. The mixture is transferred to a vacuum mixer and the abrasive is added and mixed for 10 to 30 minutes at high speed under a vacuum in the range of 5 to 100 millimeter of mercury pressure, preferably 5 to 50 mm Hg, providing a<br>
fffomogeneous mixture. The surfactant and flavor are then added to the mixture which is 'followed by mixing another 10 to 20 minutes under vacuum of 5 to 50 mm Hg. The resultant product is an abrasive dentifrice paste of a texture like that of normal toothpastes having a pH in the range of 5 to 8, preferably 6.5 to 7.5, e.g., 7, and of satisfactory flavor.<br>
The dual component composition of the present invention is packaged in a suitable dispensing container such as a tube or pump in which the components are maintained physically separated and from which the separated components may be dispensed synchronously.  Such containers are known to the art   Examples of suitable pump devices are disclosed 4,528,180 and US 5,332,124 Examples of a suitable dispensing tube are disclosed  in US 4,487,757 and 4,687,663 wherein the tube is formed from a collapsible plastic web and is provided with a partition within the tube defining separate compartments in which the physically separated components are stored and from which they are dispersed through a suitable dispensing outlet<br>
The following specific Example illustrates the present invention.  The individual gel and paste components described below were prepared by following the procedure described above The amounts of the various ingredients are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The resultant components were packaged in tubes or other containers provided with means for physical separation of the individual dentifrice components<br>
Example Chlorhexidine gel<br>
A chlorhexidine containing gel as a component of the dual component antiplaque composition of the present invention was prepared with the following ingredients<br>
(Table   Removed)<br>
Abrasive Dentifrice Component<br>
An abrasive containing dentifrice component of the dual component antiplaquue composition of the present invention was prepared with the following ingredients:<br>
(Table   Removed)<br>
The chlorhexidine gel and abrasive paste components prepared above were of extrudable consistency. The separate compartments of a multicompartment pump container were filled with the gel and paste components.  Ribbons of the two components were extruded synchronously and combined   The combined dentifrice ribbon that was formed was evaluated<br>
for antibacterial efficacy in vitro against S. mutans, a microorganism present in human plaque, by the short interval killing test (SIKT) method.<br>
The SIKT test is an in vitro anitmicrobial test which incorporates a fixed contact time wherein 1 ml of dental treatment composition diluted with water is mixed with a predetermined inoculum of bacteria (106-107) colony forming unit, (cfu/ml) for a 1-2 minute contact time   The system is then neutralized to inhibit further antibacterial activity.  The surviving bacteria are enumerated using plate count methodology. The reduction in cfu counts compared to a water control is the basis for expressing antibacterial activity of the agents.  The results of the SIKT test are recorded in Table I.  For the purposes of comparison, a commercially available antibacterial mouthrinse containing 012% by weight chlorhexidine was digluconate used as a comparative composition.<br><br>
(Table   Removed)<br>
The results recorded in Table I indicate that the antibacterial activity of the chlorhexidine in the dual component dentifrice was not impaired, when the abrasive and antibacterial compounds of the dual component dentifrice remain separated until dispensed together simultaneously for application to the teeth, the antibacterial efficacy of the dual component dentifrice of the present invention being at least equal to the commercial chlorhexidine<br>
mouthrinse.<br>
Tooth Staining Study<br>
In a two month pilot study to evaluate staining as well as product efficacy by the dual component chlorhexidine dentifrice composition of the present invention, 20 patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, one group of 10 subjects brushed their teeth<br>
'with a conventional fluoride toothpaste followed by a commercially available chlorhexidine rinse containing 012% chlorhexidine gluconate by weight   The second group used only the chlorhexidine dentifrice of the Example.  Product efficacy was clinically assessed using standard scoring methods namely Plaque Index (Quigley-Hein [Turesky Modification]) and Gingival Index (Loe-Silness).  Stain intensity was evaluated according to the method of Lobene, R R Journal of the American Dental Association, Vol  77, pages 849-855, October 1968, "Effects of Dentifrices on Tooth Stains with Controlled Brushing". Stain intensity was evaluated for both the gingival region of the tooth (i.e., near the gum line) and for the body or facial portion of the tooth (excluding the crown).  The scoring criteria was as follows:<br>
Score	Description<br>
0	=	No stain<br>
1	=	Light Stain - yellow tan<br>
2	=	Moderate stain - medium brown<br>
3	=	Heavy stain - dark brown/ black<br>
The combined components of the chlorhexidine dentifrice of the Example and the commercial chJorhexidine mouthrinse were found to be similarly efficacious against plaque, gingivitis and plaque microflora confirming the results of the SIKT test   The results of the stain intensity evaluation are recorded in Table II below and indicate that there was a very strong trend in the chJorhexidine dentifrice of the Example towards less severe staining of the teeth as compared to the commercial chlorhexidine mouthrinse.<br><br>
