				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an antenna, in particular to a stationary mobile<br>
radio antenna.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Antennas in particular in the form of stationary mobile radio antennas have<br>
been known for a long time.<br>
By way of example, EP 1 082 781 B1 discloses an antenna array having two or<br>
more primary antenna element modules which are arranged vertically one<br>
above the other and transmit and receive in one position, for example with a<br>
vertical alignment. Each individual antenna element may in this case comprise<br>
dipole antenna elements or dipole antenna element arrangements.<br>
In addition, antennas, in particular in the form of antenna arrays, are also<br>
known which transmit and/or receive on two mutually orthogonal polarization<br>
planes. Dual-polarized antennas such as diese are known, for example, from<br>
DE 198 60 121 A1. In this case, the two mutually perpendicular polarization<br>
planes are preferably rotated at an angle of 45° with respect to the horizontal<br>
(or vertical). The expression so-called X polarization or X alignment of the<br>
antenna elements is also frequency used in this case.<br>
These antennas or antenna arrays likewise once again preferably use dipole<br>
antenna elements, for example cruciform dipole antenna elements or else<br>
dipole squares. In addition, so-called vector dipoles may also be used, such as<br>
those which are known, in principle, from DE 198 60 121 Al. These dipole<br><br><br>
structures represent a dual-polarized antenna element arrangement which, from<br>
the electrical point of view, is constructed in the form of a cruciform dipole<br>
and, from the physical point of view, is approximately in the form of a square<br>
structure.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
Against the background of these fundamentally known antenna elements and<br>
antenna element arrangements, the object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an improved antenna, in particular in the form of a stationary antenna for a<br>
base station for the mobile radio range, which is equipped with a device for<br>
carrying out beamforming. One particular aim of the invention is to allow<br>
better shaping of far-field polar diagrams to be produced for antennas such as<br>
these.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved on the basis of the features<br>
specified in claim 1. Advantageous refinements of the invention are specified<br>
in the dependent claims.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, it is now possible to specifically<br>
improve the shaping of the far-field polar diagrams of corresponding antennas<br>
by measures that are additionally provided according to the invention.<br>
In this case, according to the invention, the shaping of the far-field polar<br>
diagram may be carried out just for a single antenna element, in particular even<br>
if there is only one antenna element emitting one polarization. In the same way,<br>
however, the invention can also be used for a dual-polarized antenna element<br>
or for a dual-polarized antenna element arrangement. The invention is in this<br><br>
case not just restricted to a single-band antenna but can also be used and<br>
provided for a dual-band antenna or, in general form, for a multiband antenna.<br>
In this case, the present invention is also distinguished in that the desired<br>
improvement that has been explained can be achieved by comparatively simple<br>
and low-cost measures. Furthermore, the measure that produce the<br>
improvement can be used specifically and, in particular, can be associated with<br>
individual antenna elements.<br>
In this case, the measures according to the invention can be used not just for<br>
dual-polarized antennas with dipole antenna elements, but, for example, also<br>
for patch antennas. In principle, there are no restrictions on the specific antenna<br>
element forms.<br>
The solution according to the invention is distinguished, inter alia, by the<br>
provision of a passive electrically conductive element, which is conductively<br>
connected or capacitively coupled at least indirectly to the electrically<br>
conductive reflector.<br>
The passive electrically conductive element according to the invention, which<br>
is additionally provided at least for one antenna element or one antenna<br>
element arrangement, is preferably subdivided into at least two parts and<br>
comprises a mounting section, which preferably originates from the reflector<br>
and is electrically connected or capacitively coupled to it, and in this case is<br>
preferably at least indirectly mechanically connected to the reflector. A so-<br>
called operating section, which is preferably arranged on a plane running<br>
parallel to the reflector, is then provided on the side of the mounting section<br>
facing away from the foot point of the mounting section (which is located in<br>
the vicinity of the reflector or of the reflector plane). This operating section<br>
may, moreover, be arranged such that it differs from the alignment of the<br><br>
reflector plane at least in an angular range of ± 20°, and preferably less than<br>
±10°, that is to say running at an angle to the reflector plane.<br>
The invention in this case provides for this operating section to have a length of<br>
preferably 0.2 λ up to and including 1.0λ, where λ corresponds to the<br>
wavelength in the frequency range or frequency band to be transmitted,<br>
preferably the mid-wavelength of the frequency range to be transmitted. The<br>
operating plane itself may be arranged above or below the antenna element<br>
plane of the active antenna element to be influenced by it. There is no<br>
restriction to this. However, the length of the mounting section, which is<br>
greater than the distance between the operating section of the passive<br>
electrically conductive element on the reflector, should not exceed a maximum<br>
value corresponding to twice the wavelength mentioned above.<br>
The material thickness and the transverse dimensions transversely with respect<br>
to the extent direction of the electrically conductive additionally provided<br>
beamformer element should preferably be less than 0.1 times the operating<br>
wavelength, preferably the mid-operating wavelength of the element to be<br>
influenced.<br>
In principle, mobile radio antennas which comprise decoupling elements that<br>
are in the form of rods and extend essentially at right angles to the reflector<br>
plane are known from the prior art, for example also from WO 01/04991 Al.<br>
These passive, electrically conductive coupling elements are conductively<br>
connected to the reflector plate, or are capacitively coupled at their foot point<br>
to the conductive reflector. However, these elements are electrically conductive<br>
passive decoupling devices, in order to achieve better decoupling between two<br>
dual-polarized antenna elements or antenna element devices.<br>
However, the aim of the present invention is not to ensure a decoupling<br><br><br>
element for improvement of the decoupling between two dual-polarized<br>
emission planes but, instead, the aim of the present invention is to change and<br>
to shape the polar diagram in a desired manner, for example even in the case of<br>
an antenna element device which emits only a single polarization plane,<br>
particularly when viewed in the far field. The invention therefore also provides<br>
for the operating section of the electrically conductive beamforming element<br>
according to the invention to run such that it is aligned at least essentially or<br>
approximately on the operating plane mentioned above, which is preferably<br>
parallel to the reflector plane, in the polarization direction of the element to be<br>
influenced. In this case as well, discrepancies of preferably less than 20% and<br>
in particular of less than 10%, can also still bring about the desired success<br>
according to the invention.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A first exemplary embodiment of an antenna according to the invention will be<br>
explained in more detail in the following text with reference to Figures 1 and 2.<br>
The antenna shown in Figures 1 and 2 has a reflector arrangement or a reflector<br>
1 which is conductive.<br>
An antenna element arrangement 5 which, in the illustrated exemplary<br>
embodiment, comprises a single antenna element 5a is preferably provided in<br>
the central area between the two longitudinal side areas 3. The single antenna<br><br>
element 5a in this exemplary embodiment is formed from a dual-polarized<br>
dipole antenna element which emits two mutually perpendicular planes (that is<br>
to say it transmits or receives two mutually perpendicular planes).<br>
The reflector 1 is essentially planar, at least in the area of the antenna element<br>
arrangement 5. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, projecting reflector<br>
webs or wall sections 1' are provided running in the emission direction on the<br>
longitudinal side areas 3 transversely with respect to the reflector plane. These<br>
need not necessarily be arranged at the outer lateral end of the reflector 1, but<br>
can also be provided further inwards. In addition, additional webs or outer side<br>
boundary sections may be provided, such as those which are known, for<br>
example, from the prior publications WO 99/62138 A1, US 5 710 569 A, or<br>
EP 0916 169 B1. The webs 1' which have been mentioned may in this case be<br>
aligned at right angles to the reflector plane, or else at some other, obliquely<br>
running angle.<br>
The explained antenna arrangement is generally installed such that the reflector<br>
1 runs lying on a vertical plane and, in the process, the webs 1' which have<br>
been mentioned and are arranged in the side area likewise run in the vertical<br>
direction. In contrast to the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the linear-<br>
polarized antenna element or the linear-polarized antenna element arrangement<br>
may also be aligned differently, for example such that the polarization plane<br>
does not lie on a horizontal plane, but on some other plane in contrast to this,<br>
for example in the vertical direction. In this case, the antenna element<br>
arrangement would then be aligned with the beamforming element (which will<br>
be explained later) rotated through 90°, so that the dipole antenna element then<br>
runs parallel to the webs 1' which are provided at the sides.<br>
The antenna element 5 is constructed essentially in a known manner and has<br>
two dipole halves 15, which are held via a dipole mounting device in the form<br><br>
of a balancing device 17. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the antenna<br>
element arrangement is arranged in an array 19 on the reflector 1 which, in a<br>
plan view, is at least approximately square and has a circumferential web or a<br>
circumferential wall 21.<br>
A passive electrically conductive element 25, which is sometimes also referred<br>
to in the following text as a beamforming element 25, is now provided, in<br>
particular for shaping of the polar diagram, especially with regard to the far<br>
field, but also in order to improve the matching of the active element, that is to<br>
say of the antenna element. This beamforming element 25 is subdivided at least<br>
approximately into two sections in the illustrated exemplary embodiment,<br>
specifically a mounting section 25a and a so-called operating section 25b. It<br>
can also be seen that the mounting section 25a which, like the operating section<br>
25b, is electrically conductive or is provided with an electrically conductive<br>
surface or partially with an electrically conductive surface, likewise contributes<br>
to the overall effect but that is to say the effect is not provided solely by the so-<br>
called operating section 25b.<br>
The mounting section 25a is preferably arranged directly electrically<br>
conductively on the reflector 1, and is electrically and preferably mechanically<br>
connected to it. However, the link may also be provided capacitively, so that<br>
the mounting section 25a and, in particular its foot point 25c, are capacitively<br>
coupled to the reflector 1. The mechanically and/or electrically conductive or<br>
electrically capacitive connection or coupling to the reflector 1 may, however,<br>
also be provided indirectly, by providing a corresponding link via an additional<br>
intermediate element or to the foot point of the balancing device 17. In the<br>
illustrated exemplary embodiment, a conductive ring structure 29 is provided<br>
circumferentially on the reflector 1 and at the foot point of the balancing device<br>
17, to which conductive ring structure 29 the foot section of the mounting<br>
section 25a is mechanically and electrically linked (or, in the case of capacitive<br><br>
coupling, is in this case capacitively coupled with the interposition of an<br>
insulator or dielectric).<br>
As can be seen in particular from the side view in Figure 2, a so-called<br>
transition area or transition point 25d is adjacent to the upper end of the<br>
mounting section 25a of the so-called operating section 25b, which preferably<br>
lies on an operating plane WE. This operating plane WE is preferably aligned<br>
parallel to the plane of the reflector 1, that is to say are arranged at least<br>
parallel to that reflector section in the area of the antenna elements or of the<br>
beamforming element. The operating section 25b or its essential or major part<br>
need not, however, necessarily be aligned exactly parallel to the relevant<br>
reflector section or reflector 1. Discrepancies with regard to the relevant<br>
section of the reflector of preferably less than ± 20°, in particular of less than<br>
± 10°, still lead to the desired effects.<br>
Owing to the configuration and arrangement of the mounting section, the<br>
length of the mounting section from the foot point 25c located at the bottom up<br>
to the level of the operating plane, that is to say in particular to the transition<br>
area 25d, is longer than the distance between the reflector plane RE and the<br>
operating plane WE. The mounting section 25a should in this case be larger<br>
than the distance between the operating plane WE and the reflector plane RE at<br>
least in the area of the antenna element arrangement or in the area of the<br>
beamforming element 25 to be influenced via it. The length of the mount<br>
should, however, preferably not exceed twice the wavelength (2 X) of the<br>
associated operating mid-wavelength of the antenna element arrangement 5,<br>
with this wavelength corresponding to the lower or upper end of the frequency<br>
band to be considered, preferably the wavelength in the mid-frequency band.<br>
The length of the operating section 25b in the direction of the operating plane<br>
WE should preferably correspond to 0.2 X, up to and including 
 <br>
respect to the operating wavelength (in particular the mid-operating<br>
wavelength of a frequency band to be transmitted).<br>
The operating plane itself may be located not only underneath but also above<br>
or at the same level as the active antenna element, that is to say the dipole<br>
halves 15. In this case, the operating plane (in particular in the area of the<br>
operating section 25b) should be located at a distance of preferably 0.2 λ up to<br>
and including 1.5 λ, where λ once again corresponds to the wavelength of the<br>
frequency band to be transmitted, preferably the mid-wavelength of the<br>
frequency band to be transmitted.<br>
The exemplary embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2 also shows that the<br>
operating section 25b is arranged to be copolar, that is to say it is aligned in the<br>
direction of the polarization plane. In this case, the operating section 25b is not<br>
only located parallel, but also on the polarization plane PE of the antenna<br>
element arrangement 5 to be influenced via it. In the exemplary embodiment<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 2, the polarization plane PE thus remains at right<br>
angles to the reflector 1, with the dipole halves 15 being located on this<br>
polarization plane PE and in this case, in the preferred embodiment, the<br>
mounting section 25a as well as the operating section 25b of the beamforrning<br>
elements 25, being located there as well.<br>
The illustrated exemplary embodiment also shows that two such beamforrning<br>
elements 25 according to the invention are provided for the single dipolar<br>
antenna element that is provided, which beamforming elements 25 are arranged<br>
symmetrically to a plane of symmetry at right angles to the reflector 1, as well<br>
as at right angles to the polarization plane PE and runs through the center of the<br>
antenna element arrangement 5.<br>
The following text refers to a modified exemplary embodiment, as shown in<br><br>
Figure 3.<br>
This exemplary embodiment likewise once again relates to an antenna element<br>
arrangement 5 which, in this exemplary embodiment, comprises two individual<br>
dipole antenna elements 5a and 5b, however, which are designed in the form of<br>
a dipole cruciform. The two dipole antenna elements which are aligned at right<br>
angles to one another are in this case preferably arranged rotated through an<br>
angle of +45° with respect to the horizontal or vertical plane, so that this<br>
antenna element arrangement has two polarization planes PE, which are at right<br>
angles to one another, at + 45° and - 45°.<br>
In this arrangement, two beamforming elements 25 according to the invention<br>
are in each case provided for each dipole half, that is to say for each<br>
polarization plane.<br>
The associated mounting sections 25 a are in this case preferably each once<br>
again located on one of the relevant polarization planes of the associated dipole<br>
arrangement. The operating section 25b, which is adjacent to the upper end of<br>
the respective mounting section 25a, is in this case in each case aligned at right<br>
angles in each case to the polarization plane in which the associated mounting<br>
section 25a is arranged running, that is to say they are aligned running parallel<br>
to the polarization plane of the respective other mounting section 25a. The<br>
length and size ratios are comparable to the exemplary embodiment shown in<br>
Figures 1 and 2. Thus, in this arrangement, the two side mounting sections 25a<br>
diverge from one another in the direction of the operating plane WE, starting<br>
from the reflector plane, with the operating sections 25b which are adjacent to<br>
the upper end of the mounting section 25a running toward one another on a<br>
common operating plane WE and, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment,<br>
ending at a short distance A from one another.<br><br>
In contrast to the illustrated exemplary embodiment, however, not only<br>
Figures 1 and 2 but also Figure 3 show the arrangement in such a way that the<br>
mounting section 25a does not necessarily lie on the respectively associated<br>
polarization plane PE, but also runs out of this plane between its foot point and<br>
its transition area to the associated operating section 25b, or, overall is arranged<br>
at an oblique angle to the polarization plane. Discrepancies of less than ± 20°,<br>
in particular of less than ±10°, are possible in this case. The more critical<br>
factor is, in particular, that the operating sections 25b each run parallel to an<br>
associated polarization plane PE (being located at a lateral distance from the<br>
polarization plane of the associated antenna element), with discrepancies of<br>
less than ± 20°, in particular of less than ±10°, with respect to the polarization<br>
plane also being possible here. Discrepancies between the operating plane WE<br>
and the alignment of the operating sections 25b with respect to the reflector<br>
plane can also move in the same range, that is to say this discrepancy can also<br>
be less than ± 20°, and in particular ± 10°.<br>
Once again, Figure 4 shows another different exemplary embodiment, which<br>
differs from that shown in Figure 3 in that a square compact antenna element is<br>
used as an antenna element arrangement 5 polarized in a cruciform shape. This<br>
is an antenna element arrangement as is known in principle from<br>
DE 198 60 121 A1. The outer corner points of the conductive structure may in<br>
this case be open (as has been described in DE 198 60 121 A1), or may be<br>
closed by means of an insulator or dielectric, or else electrically conductively.<br>
In this context, reference should be made to known solutions. Furthermore, in<br>
this case, the polarization planes are aligned at an angle of + 45° and - 45° with<br>
respect to the horizontal or vertical. The dipole antenna element structure,<br>
which is cruciform from the electrical point of view, in Figure 4 is an antenna<br>
element arrangement which in some cases is also referred to as a vector<br>
antenna element, cross-vector antenna element, or antenna element<br>
arrangement.<br><br>
Figures 5 to 7 serve only to show that, for example, a dual-band antenna array,<br>
in particular for a stationary mobile radio antenna, may have a conventional<br>
antenna element arrangement with antenna elements 115 for a relatively high<br>
frequency band, and antenna element arrangements 215 for transmission in a<br>
relatively low frequency band. The antenna element arrangement 215 for<br>
transmission in the relatively low frequency band in each case comprises two<br>
pairs of dipoles 215' and 215", which are arranged parallel to one another and<br>
are arranged so as to produce a dipole square. In this case, the antenna elements<br>
which are provided for transmission in the relatively high frequency band are<br>
arranged centrally in these dipole squares, with their dipole antenna elements<br>
lying on a plane which is closer to the reflector plane RE than the dipole<br>
elements 215' and 215" of the antenna elements which emit in the higher<br>
frequency band. The antenna element arrangement 215 is intended for<br>
transmission and/or reception in the relatively low frequency band (this may<br>
preferably be a frequency band operating, for example, at half the frequency of<br>
the frequency in the relatively high frequency band. However, there is no<br>
absolute necessity for any such restriction). Both the inner antenna elements<br>
215 and the outer antenna elements 115 are arranged and aligned such that both<br>
antenna element types emit on two mutually perpendicular polarization planes<br>
which, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, are aligned at an angle of<br>
+ 45° and - 45°, respectively, to the horizontal or vertical plane.<br>
An additional antenna element arrangement 115 is then also arranged between<br>
the centers of the two antenna element arrangements 115 on the reflector 1, for<br>
transmission in the relatively high frequency band (in particular for<br>
transmission in a frequency band that is twice as high as the low frequency<br>
band, the antenna element sequence and thus the antenna element separation<br>
between the antenna elements for the relatively high frequency band is thus<br>
only half as great as for the relatively low frequency band). If those<br><br><br>
beamforming elements 25 which have already been described for the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Figure 4 and in this case also used for the<br>
central antenna element arrangement 115, that is to say for the antenna element<br>
arrangement 115 which is in each case located between two antenna element<br>
arrangements 215 that are provided for the relatively low frequency range, then<br>
this results in a structure corresponding to the example shown in Figure 5.<br>
The corresponding plan view illustrated in Figure 6 shows that the<br>
beamfoiming elements 25 together with the respective mounting section 25 a<br>
and the operating section 25b adjacent to it, are in this exemplary embodiment<br>
shaped such that the respective mounting section 25a corresponds to that part<br>
of the mount or of the balancing device 17 with a corresponding dipole<br>
arrangement for the antenna element arrangement 115 which emits in the<br>
relatively low frequency band, and the operating section 25b (which is then<br>
adjacent to the mounting section 25a) of a respectively associated dipole half<br>
15' of an adjacent antenna element arrangement 215, that is to say can be<br>
aligned running parallel thereto. Thus, in this case, the mounting section 25'a<br>
essentially has the same length, the same alignment and gradient parallel to the<br>
one part of the mounting section or of the balancing device 17', and the further<br>
mounting section 25"a is arranged and positioned in a corresponding<br>
alignment, with a.90° offset in a plan view, otherwise with the same gradient<br>
and a similar or comparable length to the associated part of the mounting<br>
section or of the balancing device 17" for the antenna elements 215, that is to<br>
say also at the same distance from the vertical side edge 1' of the reflector 1'<br>
and at the same lateral distance from a central vertical plane etc., running at<br>
right angles to the reflector plane. Thus, in this exemplary embodiment, the<br>
operating sections 25b are arranged in an operating plane WE parallel to the<br>
reflector, on which the dipole elements 15' of the dipole antenna elements 215<br>
which are intended for the relatively low frequency band also come to rest. In<br>
addition, the length of the operating sections 25b corresponds approximately to<br><br><br>
the length of the respective dipole half for the relatively low frequency band, or<br>
differs by less than 40%, in particular by less than 30%, less than 20% or even<br>
less than 10%, from it. Finally, the arrangement of the operating sections with<br>
respect to the reflector is also comparable to the arrangement of the dipole<br>
halves of the adjacent antenna elements for transmission in the low frequency<br>
band. In other words, the operating sections are arranged above the reflector,<br>
such that, for example, the dipole half 215" starts and ends approximately at<br>
the same distance from the adjacent side boundary at 1' of the reflector at<br>
which the correspondingly parallel dipole half 215" of the antenna element for<br>
the relatively high frequency band likewise starts and ends. In a corresponding<br>
manner, the second operating section 25b' which is in each case at right angles<br>
to this, is arranged in the correspondingly same relative position with respect to<br>
the transverse direction of the reflector, as the parallel dipole half 215' of an<br>
adjacent antenna element for the relatively low frequency band.<br>
This allows particularly good results to be achieved since this allows not only<br>
shaping of the far-field polar diagram for not just one but also for two or more<br>
polarizations, and the use of the corresponding beamforrning elements 25<br>
furthermore makes it possible to achieve an improvement in the isolation<br>
between the polarizations, and hence an improvement in the matching of the<br>
respective active element for the relatively high frequencies.<br><br><br>
