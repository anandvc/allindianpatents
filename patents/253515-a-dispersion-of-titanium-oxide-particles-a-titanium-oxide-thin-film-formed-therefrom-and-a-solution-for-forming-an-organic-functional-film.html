Priority is claimed to Japanese application No. 2005-037616, filed February 15,<br>
2005, and Japanese application No. 2005-273905, filed September 21, 2005, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]<br>
The biodification of surfaces of substrates composed of glass, metal, plastic,<br>
ceramics and so forth has been carried out for many purposes in various fields in the prior<br>
art. For exajmple, a fluorine-containing silane coupling agent has been coated onto a<br>
glass or plastib surface to impart water repellency and oil repellency thereto.<br>
[0003]<br>
Examples of methods for forming a coating film for modifying a substrate surface<br>
are described in Patent document 1, which discloses a method for forming a chemically<br>
adsorbed film covalently bonded by means of siloxane bonds by contacting a mixed<br>
solution containing at least an alkoxysilane surfactant, a non-aqueous solvent free of<br><br>
active hydrogen, and a silanol condensation catalyst with a substrate surface. Examples<br>
of the silanol condensation catalyst disclosed therein include at least one substance<br>
selected from the group consisting of a carboxylic acid metal salt, carboxylic acid ester<br>
metal salt, carboxylic acid metal salt polymer, carboxylic acid metal salt chelate, titanic<br>
acid ester, and titanic acid ester chelate.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, these methods had problems such as film formation requiring a long<br>
period of time, and the silanol condensation catalyst inhibiting adsorption if film<br>
formation is Carried out with the catalyst still present in the solution, thereby preventing<br>
the formation of a fine monolayer.<br>
Thus; there has been a desire for the development of a technology for rapidly<br>
forming a fine monolayer having few impurities in fields such as fine patterning for the<br>
design of electrical devices in particular.<br>
[0005]<br>
Relating to the present invention, Patent document 2 discloses a composition for<br>

compound obtained by reacting the metal alcoholate and β-diketones and/or β-ketoesters,<br>
and a partial hydrolysate obtained by reacting the chelate compound with water,<br>
(d) hydrophilic organic solvent, and (e) water and co-condensation the above component<br>
(a) and the abbve component (b).<br>
The art in this document shows a composition for a coating in order to form a<br>
coating which has excellent water resistance, chemical resistance, crack resistance,<br>
weather resistance, and adhesive properties on the surface of the metal or plastics.<br>
[0007]<br>
Non-Patent document 1 discloses a solution having a composition of<br>
i<br>
Ti(OPr)3(acac)/PriOH/EtOKH=1/1/3 obtained by treating Ti(OPri)4 with acetyl acetone<br>
(acacH) followed by diluting with ethanol, this solution being a stabile photo-sensitive<br>
colloid solution, having a particle size of the colloid included in the solution of 30 to 60A.<br>
[0008]<br>

compound represented by Ti(OPr')4-x(L)x is obtained by adding a chelate agent such as<br>
acetyl acetone to Ti(OPr')4 solution, and dispersion of fine particles of titanium oxide is<br>
obtained by adding of a two-fold water equivalents to titanium atoms into the solution.<br>
[0009]<br>
However, the above Patent documents 2 and 3 and non-Patent documents 1 and 2<br>
do not disclose that dispersion of titanium oxide particles suitable for forming a titanium<br>
oxide thin film is obtained by adding excess amount of water (five-fold or more<br>

[0050]<br>
There is no limitation on a method for producing a titanium chelate compound<br>
and, for example, a method for adding a prescribed amount of chelate compound to an<br>
organic solvent solution of titanium alkoxide compound, as described later, and the like<br>
are included. The amount of chelate compound used is usually 1 to five-fold by mol and<br>
preferably 1 to three-fold by mol to 1 mol of titanium alkoxide compound.<br>
[0051]<br>
There is no limitation on the water used for adjusting the dispersion of the present<br>
invention, provided that the water is neutral. In view of obtaining a fine titanium oxide<br>
thin film haying few impurities, it is preferable to use pure water, distilled water, or<br><br>
ion-exchanged water.<br>
[0052]<br>
The amount of water used is excessive to the titanium chelate compound, and the<br>
specifically amount of water used is five-fold or more by mole, preferably ten-fold or<br>
more by mole, and more preferably twenty-fold or more by mole, to the titanium chelate<br>
compound.<br>
Also, the maximum amount of water used is determined according to the<br>
concentration of titanium chelate compound in dispersion to be adjusted. For example,<br>
in the case of adjusting dispersion having a concentration of 0.1% or more, the amount of<br>
water used is iten thousand-fold or less by mole and preferably five thousand-fold or less<br>
by mole to the titanium chelate compound. In the case of adjusting dispersion having a<br>

amount.<br>
[0054]<br>
Examples of the organic solvent used include the same examples as an organic<br>

By mixing the titanium chelate compound and an excess amount of water, a<br>
hydrolysis reaction of titanium chelate compound is begun.<br>
Examples of the method for mixing the titanium chelate compound and an excess<br>
amount of water include a method for adding water to an organic solvent solution of the<br>
titanium chelate compound or a method for adding an organic solvent solution of the<br>

[0056]<br>
There is no limitation on the organic solvent used in the organic solvent solution<br>
of the titaniurn chelate compound, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, or iso<br><br>
propanol; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, or<br>
chlorobenzene; hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, or xylene;<br>

[0057]<br>
Among them, because a hydrolysis reaction of titanium chelate compound or the<br>
like progresses with ease, a fine titanium oxide thin film can be uniformly formed, and<br>
dispersion which does not solidify at low temperature can be obtained, a water-miscible<br>
solvent is preferable and a solvent including alcohols is more preferable.<br>
[0058]<br>
Examples of the solvent including alcohols include a solvent consisting of at least<br>
one kind of alcohol or mixed solvent consisting of alcohols and another organic solvent,<br>
and a mixed solvent consisting of alcohols and another organic solvent is preferable.<br>

solvent which combines hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene and lower alcohols such<br>
as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or t-butanol is preferable.<br>

mixing ratio of hydrocarbons and lower alcohols is preferably whithin the range of 99/1 to<br>
50/50 by volume.<br>
[0060]<br>
There is no particular limitation on the concentration of the titanium chelate<br><br>

chelate compound depends on the reactivity, stability, or the like of the used titanium<br>
chelate compound, the reaction temperature is usually within the range of -100°C to the<br>
reflux temperature of the organic solvent used and preferably within the range of -20°C to<br>
room temperature. Also, the hydrolysis reaction and dehydration condensation reaction<br>
may be further conducted by raising the temperature of the reacting solution from room<br>
temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent used following adding water to a<br>
solution of titanium chelate compound at a lower temperature and aging for a certain time.<br>
[0062]<br>
The stirring time is usually from several minutes to several hours. In this case, it<br>
is preferable to conduct ultrasonic wave treatment in order to obtain uniform dispersion.<br>
[0063] <br>
In addition, an acid, base, or dispersiontabilizer may be added during the<br>
hydrolysis reaction of the titanium chelate compound with water. There are no particular<br>
limitations on the acid or base, provided that it functions as a dispersing agent for<br>
redispersing coagulated precipitate, a catalyst for producing a dispersoid such as colloidal<br>
particles by hydrolyzing and dehydrating/condensing the titanium chelate, or a dispersant<br>
for the formed dispersoid.<br>

the range of 0.1 to 10% by weight and preferably the range of 0.1 to 5% by weight as<br>
titanium oxide to the total dispersion.<br>
[0068] <br>
The dispersion of the present invention is a dispersion of titanium oxide particles<br><br>
in which the fine particles of titanium oxide being the hydrolysis product of the titanium<br><br><br>
chelate compound have the property of stably dispersing without aggregating in water<br>
solvent or organic solvent.<br>
Here, the state of stably dispersing without aggregating refers to the state in<br>
which a dispeirsoid of a hydrolysis product such as titanium chelate is not coagulated or<br>
non-uniformly separated in an organic solvent and preferably refers to a transparent,<br>
uniform state.<br>
In addition, transparent refers to the state of having high transmittance in visible<br>
light, and more specifically, refers to a state represented in terms of spectral transmittance<br>
as measured under conditions of a dispersoid concentration of 0.5% by weight as oxide, a<br>
quartz cell optical path length of 1 cm, the use of an organic solvent for the contrastive<br>
sample, and a! light wavelength of 550 nm, and preferably refers to transmittance of 80 to<br>
100%.<br>
[0069]<br>
The titanium oxide particles included in the dispersion of the present invention<br>
preferably have amphipathic property. In other words, the particles of the titanium oxide<br>
preferably have affinity for water solvent and organic solvent in order to obtain uniformly<br>
stable dispersion.<br>
A dispersion including such titanium oxide particles provides a titanium oxide<br>
thin film in the form of a uniform film in which water is not repelled when coating on a<br>
substrate, even if the water content exceeds 50% by weight to the total dispersion.<br>
[0070]<br>
There is no particular limitation on a particle size of a titanium oxide particles<br>
included in the dispersion of the present invention, although the range is normally 1 to 100<br>
nm, preferably 1 to 50 nm, and more preferably 1 to 20 nm. Also, a distribution of<br>
titanium oxide particles is preferably monodispersed.<br>
[0071] <br>

unchanged and dispersion do not become clouded, even after the dispersion of the present<br><br>
invention is kept stoppered tightly for 3 months at room temperature. Also, a titanium<br>
oxide thin film in the form of a uniform film can be obtained if dispersion which has been<br>
kept for 3 months is used.<br>
[0072]<br>
The dispersion and thin film of the present invention are fine and sensitive, has<br>
few impurities, and therefore can be used for an inorganic film for pattern formation, a<br>
surface treatment film for printing plates, groundwork inorganic film for forming a SAM<br>
film, LCD, PDP, SED (Surface Conduction Electron Emission Display);<br>
functional film used for various displays such as electronic paper, such as an insulating<br>

the glass substrate is coated, binders such as antimicrobial or mildewproofing agents, a<br>
carrier, or the like.<br>

later.<br>
[0073]<br>

dispersion of the present invention including mixing a solution obtained by adding<br>
prescribed chelate compound to an organic solvent solution of titanium alkoxide<br>
compound and an excess amount of water to the titanium alkoxide compound.<br>
According to this method, a titanium alkoxide compound which is easily<br>
available can be used to produce the dispersion of the present invention with ease and<br><br>

Ti(OC3H7-i)4, Ti(OC4H9)4, Ti[OSi(CH3)3]4, Ti[OSi(C2H5)3]4, and the like.<br>
These titanium alkoxides can be used alone or two or more types can be used in<br>
combination.<br>
[0076]<br>
A hydrolysis product of titanium alkoxide is a compound obtained by hydrolyzing<br>
all or part of titanium alkoxide with water. The amount of water used in order to obtain a<br>

[0081]<br>
There is no particular limitation on an organic solvent used in the present<br>
invention, although specific examples of the organic solvents include alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol or isopropanol; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform or chlorobenzene; hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene,<br>

Cl(CF2CFCl)2CF2CCl3, or Cl(CF2CFCl)3Cl.<br>
[0082]<br>
Of these, the organic solvent used is preferably a water-miscible solvent and more<br>
preferably a solvent including alcohol because the hydrolysis reaction of the titanium<br>
chelate compound or the like easily progresses, a fine uniform titanium oxide thin film can<br>
be formed, and dispersion which does not solidify at low temperature can be obtained.<br>
[0083]<br>
Examples of the solvent including the alcohols include solvents consisting of one<br><br>
or more kinds of alcohols or a mixed solvent consisting of alcohols and other organic<br>
solvent and a mixed solvent consisting of alcohols and other organic solvent is preferable.<br>
[0084]<br>
The solvent consisting of alcohols and other organic solvent is preferably a mixed<br>
solvent combining hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene and a lower alcohol such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or t-butanol. There is no particular limitation on the<br>
mixing ratio of the mixed solvent, although the mixing ratio of a hydrocarbon solvent and<br>
lower alcohol solvent is preferably within the range of 99/1 to 50/50 by volume.<br>
[0085]<br>
There is no particular limitation on the water used, provided that water is neutral,<br>
although it is preferable that pure water, distilled water, or ion-exchanged water be used in<br>
view of obtaining a fine titanium oxide thin film having few impurities.<br>
[0086]<br>
The water may be diluted by an organic solvent. Also, the water may be added<br>
at once, may tie added stepwise, and may be continuously added in a constant amount.<br>
Examples of organic solvents used herein include the same examples as the<br>
organic solvent dissolving the titanium alkoxide compound.<br>
[0087]<br>
The amount of water used is excessive to the titanium alkoxide compound, and<br>
the specific amount of water used is five-fold or more by mole, preferably ten-fold or<br>
more by mole, and more preferably twenty-fold or more by mole, to the titanium chelate<br>
compound or titanium alkoxide compound.<br>
Also, the maximum amount of water used is determined according to the<br>
concentration of titanium chelate compound in dispersion to be adjusted. For example,<br>
in the case of adjusting dispersion having a concentration of 0.1% or more, the amount of<br>
water used is ten thousand-fold or less by mole and preferably five thousand-fold or less<br>
by mole to the titanium chelate compound. In the case of adjusting dispersion having a<br>
concentration of 0.1% or less, the maximum amount of water used is greater.<br>
[0088]<br><br>
Examples of the method for mixing the solution obtained by adding a chelate<br>
compound to an organic solvent solution of titanium alkoxide compound and water<br>
include a method for adding water or water diluted with an organic solvent to the solution<br>
obtained by adding a chelate compound to an organic solvent solution of a titanium<br>
alkoxide compound and a method for adding a solution obtained by adding a chelate<br>
compound to an organic solvent solution of titanium alkoxide compound to water or<br>
organic solvent in which water is suspended or dissolved, although the former is<br>
preferable because of obtaining a hydrolysis product of the target product with high yield.<br>
[0089]<br>
It is conceivable that a chelate compound be added to an organic solvent solution<br>
of titanium alkoxide compound to obtain an organic solvent solution of a titanium chelate<br>
compound and an excess amount of water be added to this solution to start the hydrolysis<br>
reaction of titanium chelate compound or the like.<br>
[0090]<br>
Although a reaction temperature of this hydrolysis reaction depends on reactivity,<br>
stability, or the like of the titanium alkoxide compound or chelate compound used, the<br>
reaction temperature is generally within the range of-100°C to the reflux temperature of<br>
the organic solvent used and preferably in the range of-20°C to room temperature. Also,<br>
the hydrolysis reaction and dehydration condensation reaction may be further conducted<br>
by raising the temperature of the reacting solution from room temperature to the reflux<br>
temperature of the solvent used following adding water to the solution obtained by adding<br>
the chelate compound to the organic solvent solution of titanium alkoxide at a lower<br>
temperature and aging for a certain time.<br>
[0091]<br>
The stirring time is usually from several minutes to several hours. In this case, it<br>
is preferable to conduct ultrasonic wave treatment in order to obtain a uniform solution for<br>
forming an organic thin film.<br>
Also, when conducting the hydrolysis reaction with water in which water is added<br>
to a solution obtained by adding a chelate compound to an organic solvent solution of<br><br>
titanium alkoxide compound, acid, base, or dispersion stabilizer may be added. Specific<br>
examples of acid, base, or dispersion stabilizer include the same examples as acid, base, or<br>
dispersion stabilizer which can be added when conducting the hydrolysis reaction of<br>
titanium chelate compound with water.<br>
[0092] <br>

invention can be obtained.<br>
Also, in the present invention, the dispersion of the present invention can be<br>
produced by the method in which the titanium chelate compound is isolated from the<br>
solution obtained by adding the chelate compound to the organic solvent solution of<br>
titanium alkoxide compound, the isolated titanium chelate compound is re-dissolved in the<br>
organic solvent, and water is added.<br>
[0093]<br>
Although insoluble materials may be separated in the prepared dispersion, these<br>
separation materials can be removed by conducting filtration, decantation, or the like to<br>
obtain uniform dispersion.<br>
[0094]<br>
3) Titanium oxide thin film<br>
The third aspect of the present invention provides a titanium oxide thin film<br>
which is formed by contacting the surface of the substrate including at least one kind<br>
selected from the group consisting of metals, ceramics, glass, and plastics with the<br>
dispersion of the present invention.<br>
[0095] <br>
The substrate used in the present invention is preferably a substrate consisting of<br>
at least one kind selected from the group consisting of metal, ceramics, glass, and plastics<br>
and a substrate consisting of plastics is preferable.<br>
[0096]<br>
Although there is no limitation on plastics, examples of the plastics include<br>
polyimide, polyamide, polyamideimide, polyphenyleneether, polyetherketone,<br><br>
polyetheretherketone, polyolefin, polyester, polycarbonate, polysulphone, polyether<br>
sulphone, polyphenylenesulfide, polyallylate, acrylic-series resin, cyclolefin-series<br>
polymer, aromatic-series polymer, and the like.<br>
[0097]<br>
Although there is no limitation on the substrate used of the present invention, a<br>
substrate having an active hydrogen such as a hydroxyl group or the like on the surface<br>
may be used for the purpose of improving adhesion properties with a thin film.<br>
[0098]<br>
Although there is no limitation on the method for contacting dispersion of the<br>
present invention with the substrate surface, generally known methods may be adopted.<br>
Specific examples of the method include a dipping method, spin coating method, spray<br>
method, roller coating method, mayer bar coater method, screen printing method, brush<br>
coating method, and the like.<br>
[0099]<br>
The titanium oxide thin film of the present invention can decompose and/or<br>
remove an organic compound contacting with the thin film by photoirradiation.<br>
Although there is no limitation on the organic compound contacting with this thin film, a<br>
monolayer is effective because high-speed decomposition can proceed. Especially,<br>
silicon compound such as a silane-series surfactant or the like is effective, because a<br>
self-assembled monolayer is formed on the titanium oxide thin film.<br>
[0100]<br>
Although examples of the method for forming a monolayer of the organic<br>
compound include various methods such as a vapor phase evaporation method, method of<br>
chemical adsorption from a solution in which an organic compound is dissolved, or LB<br>
method, any method may be used.<br>
[0101]<br>
When using the method of chemical adsorption from a solution, there is no<br>
limitation on a temperature used to contact the solution with the substrate surface,<br>
provided that the temperature is within the range that maintains the stability of the solution.<br><br>
The temperature is normally within the range of room temperature to reflux temperature of<br>
the organic solvent used. It is acceptable to heat the dispersion or the substrate itself in<br>
order to set the preferable temperature for contact.<br>
[0102]<br>
Also, after contacting the dispersion of the present invention with the substrate<br>
i<br>
surface, an ultrasonic wave may be used in order to facilitate film formation.<br>
The step of contacting the substrate surface may be conducted for a long time at<br>
once or may be divided into several short-time applications.<br>
[0103]<br>
After forming the monolayer, a cleaning step may be performed in order to<br>
remove excess agent, impurities, or the like adhered on the film surface. By providing<br>
the cleaning step, the film thickness can be further controlled.<br>
[0104]<br>
There is no limitation on the cleaning step, provided that the step can remove an<br>
I<br>
adhered material. Examples of the method include a method for immersing a substrate in<br>
a solvent able to dissolve the titanium chelate compound; a method for leaving the<br>
substrate under a vacuum or normal pressure to vaporize the adhered material; a method<br>
for spraying With inactive gas such as dried nitrogen gas and blowing out the adhered<br>
material; and the like.<br>
[0105] <br>
After contacting the dispersion of the present invention with the substrate or<br>
cleaning the substrate, it is preferable to heat the substrate in order to stabilize the film<br><br>
formed on the substrate surface. The heating temperature can be determined according to<br>
the kind of substrate, the stability of the formed monolayer, or the like.<br>
[0106]<br>
Although a mechanism for forming the monolayer of silicon compound is not<br>
obvious in detail, it is assumed that the surface is coated by forming the rigid band of<br>
Ti-O-Si after silicon compound physically adsorbs or chemically adsorbs to a titanium<br>
oxide thin film having active hydrogen on the surface.<br><br>
[0107] <br>
Although there is no limitation on film thickness of the titanium oxide thin film<br>
of the present invention obtained as above, the film thickness is normally 500 nm or less,<br>
preferably 1 to 100 nm, and more preferably 5 to 50 nm.<br>

[0109]<br>
Also, a titanium oxide thin film of the present invention has excellent flatness.<br>
The average roughness Ra of the titanium oxide thin film is 2 nm or less and preferably 1<br>
nm or less. Therefore, a flat organic functional film can be formed on this titanium oxide<br>
thin film as described later.<br>
[0110]<br>
A titanium oxide thin film generally has thin film properties which are changed<br>
by photoirradiation. It is preferable that the titanium oxide thin film of the present<br>
invention be a photocatalytically active film which can decompose and/or remove an<br>
organic compound contacting with the titanium oxide thin film by photoirradiation.<br>
[0111]<br>
The irradiation light using the photoirradiation is preferably ultraviolet rays and<br>
more preferably ultraviolet rays having a wavelength of 250 to 350nm.<br>
The amount of the irradiation light is 40 J/cm2 or less and preferably 5 J/cm2 or<br>
less.<br>
[0112]<br>
The titanium oxide thin film of the present invention is preferably a hydrophilic<br>
film having a Water contact angle of 20 ° or less by photoirradiation.<br>
When the titanium oxide thin film of the present invention has these properties, a<br>
resist film with a prescribed pattern can be formed and a specific part of the titanium oxide<br>
thin film can be changed to be a hydrophilic thin film by photoirradiation with a<br><br>
prescribed pattern.<br>
[0113]<br>
The titanium oxide thin film of the present invention is quickly formed on the<br>
substrate surface by using the dispersion of the present invention and is a fine film having<br>
few impurities regardless of a kind of substrate used.<br>
[0114]<br>
These titanium oxide thin films can be applied to design patterns for forming<br>
electric devices or the like, electronic products, and especially ultra thin film coating such<br>
as for electric appliances, automobiles, industrial equipment, mirrors, eyeglass lenses, or<br>
the like which require heat resistance, resistance to weather, and abrasion resistance, as<br>
well as a photocatalyst film.<br>
Also, as described later, this titanium oxide thin film is coated with an organic<br>
functional film by using a solution for forming an organic functional film or the like to act<br>
as a photo catalyst layer and conduct photo lithography with ease.<br>

referred to as "Solution A-5" and the water content is 38.9-fold by moles to the total<br>
number of mole of titanium oxide and ODS) which included fine particles of reaction<br>
product obtained by reacting ODS with titanium oxide. The above operations ware<br>
conducted at room temperature.<br>
[0171]<br>
(Comparative {Example 1) Preparation of solution for forming thin film (6)<br>
181.8 g of diisopropoxy diacetylacetonatetitanium (Trade name: "T-50"<br>
manufactured by Nippon Soda Co., Ltd., the solid content of 16.5% by weight as titanium<br>
oxide) was dissolved in 2818.2 g of mixed solvent of ethanol/ethyl acetate=50/50 (volume<br>
ratio) to obtain a yellow, transparent solution for forming a thin film (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "Solution H-1") having a concentration of 1% by weight as titanium oxide. The<br>
above operations were conducted at room temperature.<br>
[0172]<br>
(Comparative Example 2) Preparation of solution for forming thin film (7)<br>
181.8 g of diisopropoxydisacetylacetonatetitanium (Trade name: "T-50"<br>
manufactured by Nippon Soda Co., Ltd., solid content of 16.5% by weight as titanium<br>
oxide) was dissolved in 2794.6 g of mixed solvent of ethanol/ethyl acetate=50/50(volume<br>
ratio). 24.31 g (3.6-fold by mol to diisopropoxy bisacetylacetonatetitanium) of<br>
ion-exchanged water was slowly added dropwise into this solution at room temperature<br>
while stirring io obtain a yellow, transparent solution for forming a thin film (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "Solution H-2") having a concentration of 1% by weight as titanium oxide.<br>
The above operations were conducted at room temperature.<br>
[0173] (2) Evaluation method of solution<br>
Physical properties of the solution for forming a thin film (Solution A-1 to<br>
Solution A-5) prepared in Examples 1 to 5 and the solution for forming a thin film<br><br>
(Solution H-1 and Solution H-2) prepared in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were<br>
evaluated by the following evaluation methods.<br>
[0174]<br>
(i) Measurement of particle size of metallic compound in solution<br>
The particle size of the metallic compound in the solution was measured by using<br>
a particle diameter measurement apparatus (HPPS, manufactured by Malvern Instruments<br>
Ltd.).<br>
Also, the particle size of the metallic compound in the solution for forming a thin<br>
film (Solution A-1 to A-5, H-1, and H-2) which had kept at room temperature for 3<br>
months was measured.<br>
The measurement results are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, "particle size"<br>
indicates an average particle size.<br>
[0175]<br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br>
[0176]<br>
As shown in Table 1, the titanium chelate compounds in Solution A-1 to A-5<br>
proceeded with the hydrolysis-condensation by adding a large amount of water and were<br>
polymerized to particles of titanium oxide having a particle size of 4 to 10 nm and were<br>
extremely similar structure to titanium oxide.<br>
[0177]<br>
A particle size distribution of titanium oxide particles included in Solution A-3 is<br>
shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the horizontal axis shows average particle size (nm) and the<br>
vertical axis shows peak strength (Intensity). The titanium oxide particles included in<br>
Solution A-3 show a monodispersed distribution with extremely sharp peak.<br>
[0178]<br>
Also, as shown in Table 1, the keep stability was excellent. Even the solution<br>
which had been kept for 3 months had particles having the particle size of 13 nm or less<br>
and was transparent. This showed that the examples of the present invention have<br>
excellent keeping stability.<br>
[0179]<br><br>
On the other hand, in case of Comparative Example 1 in which water was not<br>
added at all, particles of titanium compound were not formed and the particle size could<br>
not be measured, because the hydrolysis reaction did not occur.<br>
In the case of Comparative Example 2 in which the amount of the water added<br>
was 3.6-fold by mole to the titanium, the isopropoxy group proceeded with<br>
hydrolysis-condensation to produce particles having a particle size of about 1 nm.<br>
However, the! chelate portion did not sufficiently proceed with hydrolysis-condensation<br>
and, as a result, an aggregation occurred to form a large agglomerate having a size of 86<br>
nm and the stability was poor.<br>
[0180]<br>
(ii) TG/DTA measurement of titanium oxide particles in Solution A-3<br>
Solution A-3 was concentrated at 50°C under reduced pressure and dried at 50°C<br>
in a vacuum, to be a powder. TG/DTA (diffential thermogravimetric analysis) was<br>
measured under the condition in which the rate of temperature increase was 20°C/min<br>
under nitrogen gas. A result of measurement analysis is shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, a<br>
sharp endothermic peak according to decomposition of the propoxy group and<br>
acetylacetonate group, which was observed in the case of diisopropoxy<br>
diacetylacetoriatetitanium (T-50) as raw material, was not observed in the case of Solution<br>
A-3. For this reason, it was suggested that almost all of the isopropoxy group and<br>
acetylacetonate group in Solution A-3 were hydrolyzed. It was assumed that the weight<br>
was reduced by elimination of moisture adsorbing to particles, isopropanol, acetyl acetone<br>
alcohol, and hydroxyl group surface.<br>
Also, in FT-IR analysis and H-NMR analysis, isopropoxy group and<br>
acetylacetonate group bonding to titanium atom were not observed.<br>
[0181]<br>
(iii) Measurement of zeta potential of solution in pH titration<br>
The zeta potential was measured by changing pH of Solution A-3 in Example 3<br>
from 2 to 12 by using hydrochloric acid of 0.2 mol/L and aqueous sodium hydroxide of<br>
0.2 mol/L. The measurement results are shown in Fig. 3. The measurement results of<br><br>
zeta potential of Solution A-3 shown in Fig.3 showed pH of the isoelectric point of 6.29<br>
and almost the same results as anatase-type titanium oxide. It was suggested that the<br>
particles were charged positively to be stable, because pH of Solution A-3 was about 5.<br>
[0182]<br>
(iv) Amphipathic property evaluation of titanium oxide particles<br>
Each of Solutions A-1 to A-3 was added to a solution in either of 0.1 g or 1 g in<br>
which 1 g of toluene was added to 9 g of water and dispersed with supersonic waves, and<br>
whether or not the stably dispersed emulsification products were obtained was evaluated.<br>
In all cases of Solutions A-1 to A-3, stably, dispersed emulsification products were<br>
obtained. It seems that the outer surface of toluene drops was encircled with amphiphilic<br>
nanoparticles.<br>
[0183]<br>
In analysis results of 'H-NMR, the total of alkoxyl group and chelate group<br>
bonding to Ti was four-fold by mole in the case of the Comparative Example 1 and 0.8<br>
-fold by mole in case of the Comparative Example 2. In Solution H-1 of the<br>
Comparative Example 1 and Solution H-2 of the Comparative Example 2, the hydrolysis<br>
of titanium chelate compound was insufficient. Also, no obvious zeta potential was<br>
observed in Solutions H-1 and H-2.<br>
[0184]<br>
(3) Forming thin film<br>
(Examples 6 to 17, Comparative Examples 3 and 4)<br>
The following substrates for forming a thin film were prepared and the surfaces<br>
thereof were cleaned by ethanol and dried. Next, each substrate surface was coated with<br>
each solution (Solution A-1 to Solution A-5) prepared in the above Examples 1 to 5 and<br>
solution (Solution H-1 and Solution H-2) prepared in the above Comparative Examples 1<br>
and 2 by mayer bar coater (using bar No. 3) and dried at 60°C for 10 minutes to form a<br>
thin film. The obtained thin films were referred as to C-1 to C-12, CH-1, and CH-2.<br><br>
Because the film is obtained by drying at 60°C, the solution could be applied to the<br><br>
substrate such as plastics having no heat resistance.<br><br>
[0185]<br>
The following substrate was used as the substrate for forming a thin film.<br>
B-1: polyester sheet (Trade name "Lumirror" manufactured by Toray Industries, INC.)<br>
B-2: polyimide sheet (Trade name "Kapton" manufactured by DU PONT-TORAY<br>
CO.,LTD)<br>
B-3: Soda lime glass substrate plate (SLG)<br>
B-4: aluminum plate<br>
A kind of substrate and solution for forming a thin film are shown together in Table 1.<br>
[0186]<br>
(4) Evaluation method of thin film<br>
Next, the physical properties of the thin film (C-1 to C-12, CH-1, CH-2) formed<br>
in the above (3) were measured by the following test methods and evaluated.<br>
[0187]<br>
(i) Crystallizability of thin film<br>
The crystallizability of the thin film was evaluated by measuring with an X-ray<br>
diffraction instrument.<br>
All of thin films (C-1 to C-12) were amorphous films having a film thickness of<br>
10 to 40 ran.<br>
[0188]<br>
(ii) Film appearance<br>
The shifts of haze degree by coating the thin film were measured, the appearances<br>
of the thin films were observed by viewing, and the thin films were evaluated as follows.<br>
Evaluation O: transparent, shift of haze degree of 0.5% or less, film spot absence<br>
Evaluation X: shift of haze degree of 0.5% or more, film spot presence<br>
[0189] (iii) Adhesion properties (tape peeling test)<br>
After cellophane-tape was applied to each sample and rubbed a few times with a<br>
finger cushion, when the tape was peeled, whether or not the thin films on the substrate<br>
were separated was evaluated by elemental analysis with XPS and evaluated as follows.<br><br>
Evaluation O: no separation<br><br>
Evaluation X: separation<br>
[0190] <br>
The above evaluation results are shown in Table 2.<br>
In Table 2, the film appearances of the thin films (C-1 to C-12) were excellent<br>
and the adhesion properties were also excellent. The thin film (CH-1) of theComparative<br>
example 3 and the thin film (CH-2) of the Comparative Example 4 had fogging and the<br>
adhesion properties thereof were not excellent.<br>
[0191]<br>
(iv) Surface smoothness of thin film<br>
The average surface roughness (Ra) by scanning probe microscopy before and<br>
after coating bf Solution A-3 is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows that while the average<br>
surface roughness of polyester substrate was 1.37 ran, the average surface roughness Ra<br>
was 0.70 ran after coating of the film, and thus the surface roughness was improved to<br>
provide surface smoothness.<br>
[0192]<br>
(v) Element distribution in thin film<br>
The element distribution along the depth direction of the films was measured by<br>
using an XPS analyzer (Quantum 2000 manufactured by Ulvac-Phi, Inc).<br>
The film was removed by argon sputtering at 1 kV at 0.25 minute intervals and<br>
measured by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy to obtain the content rates by percentage of<br>
carbon atom, oxygen atom, titanium atom, or the like in the film by using the following<br>
formula.<br>
[0193] [Formula 1]<br>
Content ratio of carbon element by percentage (%)<br>
=(Concentration of carbon atom)/{(Concentration of oxygen atom) +<br>
(Concentration of carbon atom) + (Concentration of the total metal atom)}* 100<br>
[0194]<br><br>
The element distribution in the thin film (C-1) formed from Solution A-1 was<br>
evaluated by XPS and the results thereof are shown in Fig. 5. In the analysis result, the<br>
samples obtained by coating the substrate of polyester with Solution A-1 and drying at<br>
60°C were measured along the depth direction. In the thin film, the content rate of the<br>
carbon by percentage depending on the organic compound was extremely low, 10% or less<br>
by weight, showing that the thin film was almost an titanium oxide.<br>
[0195]<br>
The element distribution in the thin film (C-8) formed from Solution A-4 was<br>
evaluated by XPS and the results thereof are shown in Fig. 6. Even in this case, the<br>
content rate of residual carbon in the thin film was extremely low, 10% or less by weight,<br>
despite drying at 60°C.<br>
[0196]<br>
On the other hand, the thin film (CH-1) similarly formed by using Solution H-1<br>
of the Comparative Example 1, in which, as shown in Fig. 7, the hydrolysis proceeded by<br>
moisture in the air at the film surface (the depth of 0 to 100 nm) to be a comparatively low<br>
carbon content with a large amount of carbon remaining at the inside of the film (the depth<br>
of 10 to 40 nm) was non-uniform weak film having low hardness.<br>
[0197]<br>
Also, the thin film similarly formed by using Solution H-2 of the Comparative<br>
Example 2 in which, as shown in Fig. 8, the carbon content by percentage depending on<br>
the organic compound was high and titanium oxide was not formed, was a weak film.<br>
[0198]<br>
(vi) Measurement of Water Contact Angle<br>
After adding 5 ul of water and toluene onto the surface of each sample from a<br>
microsyringe, the contact angle was measured 30 seconds later using a contact angle<br>
measuring instrument (Model 360S manufactured by Erma Inc.).<br>
The measurement results are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0199] <br>
(vii) Evaluation of ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity<br><br>
I<br>
As a lamp for UV irradiation, the following two kinds of lamp were used.<br>
UV1: Bactericidal lamp (Trade name "GL-15" manufactured by Toshiba Corporation: UV<br>
of 254 nm), Intensity of 4 mW/cm2<br>
UV2: Black light (Trade name "FL15BLB" manufactured by Toshiba Corporation: UV of<br>
365 nm), Intensity of 2 mW/cm2<br>
[0200]<br>
The film was irradiated with the above ultraviolet and the water contact angle was<br>
measured to evaluate the change of the surface wettability. The UV irradiation energy<br><br>
was calculated until the water contact angle became 20° or less (the thin film became<br>
hydrophilic). <br>
The calculated results are shown in Table 2.<br>
An example in which Solution A-1 of Example 1 and UV2 as a light source was<br>
used, was defined as the Reference Example 1.<br>
[0201]<br>
The thin film obtained in examples immediately showed hydrophilicity by<br>
irradiation of UV of 254 nm to show the contact angle of 20° or less.<br>
The contact angle of the thin film of Example 13 was about 20° showing<br>
hydrophilicty, even before irradiation of UV. By the irradiation of UV of 254 nm, the<br>
hydrophilicity; of the thin film increased.<br>
[0202]<br>
The thin films (C-10 to C-12) formed by using Solution A-5 showed extremely<br>
high water repellency and showed hydrophilicity by irradiation of UV of 254 nm having<br>
low energy. Because of this, it is possible that a hydrophilic-hydrophobic pattern is<br><br>
produced by irradiation with a photomask, and the use in which a functional film is<br><br>
individuated by coating ink or plating can be expected.<br>
[0203]	<br>
When the thin film was treated with UV ozone for 3 minutes by using a UV<br>
ozone device (Eyeozon cleaning device, manufactured by Eyegraphics CO., LTD.,<br>
low-pressure marcury lamp) instead of irradiation of UV of 254 nm by UV 1, the thin film<br><br>
had hydrophilicity and the water contact angle of 10° or less. The thin film provided the<br>
same effects as the film when using UV1.<br>
[0204]<br>
However, the thin film formed from Solution H-1 could not active hydrophilicity<br>
by irradiation, because of the residual organic compound in the thin film.<br>
The thin film formed from Solution H-2 of the Comparative Example 2 showed<br>
hydrophilicity, although it needed a long time until the thin film showed hydrophilicity (i.e.<br><br>
the thin film needed a large energy for hydrophilicity).<br>
Also; the thin film of Example 1 did not show hydrophilicity by irradiation of UV<br>
of 365 nm and therefore it is different from the film having a normal anatase-type titanium<br>
oxide photo icatalyst which showed hydrophilicity by irradiation of UV of 365 nm<br>
(Reference Example 1).<br>
[0205]<br>
[Table 2]<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0206]<br>
(Example 18)<br>
The thin film C-13 was formed on the substrate B-1 by using Solution A-3. This<br>
substrate was set on the belt conveyer at the top of which a high pressure mercury vapor<br>
lamp (manufactured by Eyegraphics CO., LTD., 160 W/cm of lamp intensity, lamp height<br>
of 10 cm, wavelength distribution referring the following table 3) was provided so as to<br>
take the surface of the thin film C-13 at the upper side and passed at a rate of 16.67 cm/sec<br>
under the high pressure mercury vapor lamp by the belt conveyer. At this time, the<br>
irradiation time was 0.6 seconds by the high pressure mercury vapor lamp. This<br>
operation was repeated 10 times and the water contact angle of the thin film C-13 was<br>
measured each time. The measurement results are shown in Table 4.<br>
[0208]<br>
[0207]<br><br><br><br>
[0209]<br>
From Table 4, when the pass time was 7 times (4.2 seconds of the total irradiation<br>
time), the water contact angle of the thin film C-13 was 7.0°. The result shows that<br>
according the substrate of Example 18, the irradiated surface of the thin film C-13 can<br>
show hydrophilicity (the water contact angle of 20° or less) by irradiation of ultraviolet<br>
light for an extremely short time (about 3.0 seconds).<br>
[0210]<br>
