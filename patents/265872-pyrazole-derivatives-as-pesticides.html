				<td>Chemical comopounds, process for their preparation and use thereof Description<br>
The invention relates to novel phenylpyrazole-oximcarbamate derivatives, processes for their preparation; to compositions thereof, and to their use for the control of pests (including arthropods and helminths).<br>
The control of insects, arachnids and helminths with 5-alkoxycarbonylamino- and 5-haloalkoxycarbonylaminopyrazole compounds has been described in, for example, in EP-A-295,117, WO-A-2000/35,884 and WO-A-2003/74,493.<br>
Furthermore, WO-A-87/03,781and WO-A-2003/74,492 disclose 1-aryl-pyrazol derivatives and their use asj pesticidal agents.<br>
However, since modem pesticides must meet a wide range of demands, for example regarding level, duration and spectrum of action, use spectrum, toxicity, combination with other active substances, combination with formulation auxiliaries or synthesis, and since the occurrence of resistances is possible, the development of such substances can never be regarded as concluded, and there is constantly a high demand for novel compounds which are advantageous over the known compound!, at least as far as some aspects are concerned.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide new pesticides which may be used in domestic companion animals.<br>
It is advantageous to apply pesticides to animals in oral form so as to prevent the possible contamination of humans or the surrounding environment.<br>
Another o|ject of the invention is to provide new pesticides which may be used in lower dose than existing pesticides.<br>
Another ofject of the invention is to provide new pesticides which are substantially non-emetic.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide new pesticides which are safer to the user and the environment<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide new pesticides which show improved activity against ectoparasites in terms of application rate and long lasting activity as systemic ectoparasiticides.<br><br>
These objects are met in whole or in part by the present invention.<br>
The 5-aminopyrazole carbamate derivatives of the present invention are characterized by a ketone-oxime groups in the carbamate group.<br>

Collections! of compounds of the formula I which can be synthesized by the above mentioned process may therefore be prepared in a parallel manner, and this may be effected manually or in a semi-automated or fully automated manner. In this case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of t|e reaction, work-up or purificadon of the products or of the intermediates. In total, this is to be understood ace meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. Dewitt in "Annual report! in Combinatorial Chemistry of and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, pubjishing house Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
A series of commercially available apparatuses are offered by, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesfaury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England of or H+P laboratory technology Ltd., Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschleiflheim, Germany of or Radleys, Shirehill, Saffron Walden, Essex, England, May be used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and work-up.<br>
For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula I or of intermediates obtained during the preparation!, use may of be made, inter alia, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those by ISCO, Inc.,, 4700 superiors Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the .individual process steps are automated,! but manual operation must be performed between the process steps. This can be prevented by Employing semi-integrated or fully integrated automation of system of where the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Look automation of system of can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, of Hopkinton, MA 01748, for USA.<br>
In addition; to what has been described here, compounds of the formula I may be prepared in part or fully by solid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate  steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin. Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example Barry A., Bunin in "The Combinatorial index", Academic Press, 199$.<br>
The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols which are known from the literature and which, in does gymnastics, can be performed manually or in at automated manner. Far example, the "tea-bag method" (Houghten) U.S. 4,631,211; Houghten et al., Proc. Natl. Acadj.Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135, in which products by IRORI, 11149 North-Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla CA 92037 USA, are employed, May be semiautomated. The_automation of solid-phase-supp|&gt;rted, parallel syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses by Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech Ltd., Wullejner field 4, 58454 Witten, Germany.<br>

According to the invention all plants and plant parts can be treated. Plants are hereby understood to mean all plants and plant populations such as desirable and undesirable wild plants or cultigens (including naturally occurring cultigens). Cultigens can be plants that can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimisation methods or by biotechnology or genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including transgenic plants and including plant varieties that are protectable or not protectable by plant varieties protection rights. Plant parts are understood to be all above ground and below fcround parts and organs of the plants such as scion, leaf, blossom and root, including, for example, leaves, needles, stalks, stems, blossoms, fruiting bodies, fruits and seed as well as roots, bulbs, rhizomes. Harvest crops as well as vegetative and generative reproduction material, for example cuttings, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots and seed also belong to plant parts.<br>
In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or mites, or helminths, especially nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises applying to the plants or to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a compound of the invention. For such a method, the compound of the invention is generally applied to the locus in which the arthropod or nematode infestation  is to be controlled at an effective rate in the range of about 2g to about 1kg of the active compound jper hectare of locus treated. Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, a lower rate may offer adequate protection. On the other hand, adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest or other factors may require that the active ingredient be used at higher rates. The optimum rate depends usually upon a number of factors, for example, the type of pest being<br><br>
controlled,the type or the growth stage of the infested plant, the row spacing or also the method of application.; Preferably an effective rate range of the active compound is from about l0g/ha to about 400g/ha, more preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g/ha.<br>
When a pest is soil-borne, the active compound generally in a formulated composition, is distributed evenly (over the area to be treated (ie, for example broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner) and is applied at rates from about lOg ai/ha to about 400g ai/ha, preferably from about 50g ai/ha to about 200 g ai/ha (,,ai" means active ingredient). When applied as a root dip to seedlings or drip) irrigation to plants the liquid solution or suspension contains from about 0.075 to about 1000 |mg ai/1, preferably from about 25 to about 200 mg ai/1. Application may be made, if desired, to the field or crop-growing area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected frij)m attack.<br>
The compound of the invention can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over the area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall.<br>
During or after application, the formulated compound can, if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains. Application can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place, or after sprouting.<br>
The compound of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith are of particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard or vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantatio or forest trees, for example: cereals (such as wheat or rice), cotton, vegetables (such as peppers) field crops (such as sugar beets, soybeans or oil seed rape), grassland or forage crops (such as majze or sorghum), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fruit or citrus), ornamental plants, flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks, or forest trees (both deciduous and) evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries.<br>
They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted, stored or structural) from attack  for example, by sawflies or beetles or termites.<br>
They have Applications in the protection of stored products such as grains, fruits, nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or compounded into products, from moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack. Also protected are stored animal products such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains from beetle, mite or fly attack.<br><br>
Additionally, the compound of the invention and methods of use thereof are of particular value in the control of arthropods or helminths which are injurious to, or spread or act as vectors of diseases domestic animals, for example those hereinbefore mentioned, and more especially in the control of ticks, mites lice, fleas, midges, or biting, nuisance or myiasis flies. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in controlling arthropods or helminths which are present inside domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood of the animal, for which purpose they may be administered orally, parenterally, percutaneously or topically.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described for application to growing crops or crop growing loci or as a seed dressing may, in general, alternatively be employed in the protection of stored products, household goods, property or areas of the general environment. Suitable means of applying the compoundsjof the invention include:<br>
to growing crops as foliar sprays (for example as an in-furrow spray), dusts, granules, fogs or foams or also as suspensions of finely divided or encapsulated compositions as soil or root treatments by liquid drenches, dusts, granules, smokes or foams; to seeds of crops via application as seed dressings, e.g. by liquid slurries or dusts;<br>
to animals Infested by or exposed to infestation by arthropods or helminths, by parenteral, oral or topical appjication of compositions in which the active ingredient exhibits an immediate and/or prolonged ajction over a period of time against the arthropods or helminths, for example by incorporation in feed or suitable orally-ingestible pharmaceutical formulations, edible baits, salt licks, dietary supplements, pour-on formulations, sprays, baths, dips, showers, jets, dusts, greases, shampoos, creates, wax smears or livestock self-treatment systems;<br>
to the environment in general or to specific locations where pests may lurk, including stored products, timber, household goods, or domestic or industrial premises, as sprays, fogs, dusts, smokes, wax-smears, lacquers, granules or baits, or in tricklefeeds to waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
The compounds of formula I are particularly useful for the control 6f parasites of animals when applied orally, and in a further preferred aspect of the invention the compounds of formula I are used for the control of parasites of animals by oral application. The compounds of the formula I or salts thereojf may be administered before, during or after meals. The compounds of the formula I or salts thereof may be mixed with a carrier and/or foodstuff.<br><br>
The compound of the formula I or salt thereof is administered orally in a dose to the animal in a dose range generally from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg of the compound of the formula I or salt thereof per kilogram of (animal body weight (mg/kg).<br>
The frequency of treatment of the animal, preferably the domestic animal to be treated by the compound of th| formula I or salt thereof is generally from about once per week to about once per year, preferably from about once every two weeks to once every three months.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered most advantageously with another parasiti-cidally effective material, such as an endoparasiticide, and/or an ectoparasiticide, and/or an endec-toparasiticide. For example, such compounds include macrocyclic lactones such as avermectins or milbemycins e.g., ivermectin, pyratel or an insect growth regulator such as lufenuron or metho-prene.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can also be employed for controlling harmful organisms in crops of known genetically engineered plants or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by especially advantageous properties, for example by resistances to particular crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as particular bisects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties concern, for example, the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known where the starch content is increased, or the starch quality is altered, or where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
All plants fhat have received by genetic engineering modification genetic material that imparts particularly! advantageous valuable properties ("traits") to these plants belong to the transgenic (obtained by genetic engineering) plants or plant varieties to be preferably treated in accordance with the indention. Examples of such properties are improved plant growth, increased tolerance toward high or low temperatures, increased tolerance toward drought or toward water or soil salt content, improved blossoming performance, simplified harvesting, accelerated ripening, increased harvest yields, improved quality and/or nutritional value of the crop, better storage life and/or processing of the crop. Further and particularly emphasised examples of such properties are increased resistance of the plants toward zoopests and microbial pests, such as toward insects, mites, pathogenic plant fungi, bacteria and/or viruses as well as an increased tolerance of the plants toward certain herbicides. Examples of such transgenic plants are the important cultigens such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soy, potato, sugar beet, tomato, peas, and other vegetable varieties, cotton, tobacco, rape as well as fruit plants (with the fruits apple, pear, citrus fruits and grapes), whereby<br><br>
maize, soy, potato, cotton, tobacco and rape are especially emphasised. Properties ("traits") especially emphasised are the increased tolerance of the plants toward insects, arachnids, nematodes and gastropods through the toxins formed in the plants, especially those that are produced in the plants (hereinafter known as "Bt plants") by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (e.g. from the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CryIA(c), CryllA, CrymA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF as well as their combinations). Also particularly emphasised as properties ("traits") is the increasdd resistance of plants toward fungi, bacteria and viruses through systemically acquired resistance (BAR), systemin, phytoalexine, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed profeins and toxins. Further particularly emphasised properties ("traits") are the increased tolerance ot the plants to certain active herbicidal compounds, for example imidazolinones, sul-phonylureas;, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (e.g. "PAT'-gene). The respective genes imparting the desired properties ("traits") can also occur in the transgenic plants in combination with each other. Examples of such "Bt plants" are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soy varieties and potato varieties that are marketed under the trade marks YIELD GARD® (e.g. maize, cotton, soy), KnockOut® (e.g. maizej, StarLink® (e.g. maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide tolerant plants are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soy varieties that are marketed under the trade marks Roundup Ready® (tolerance toward glyphosate, e.g. maize, cotton, soy), Liberty Link® (tolerance toward phosphinotricin, e.g. rape), IMI® (tolerance toward imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance toward sulphonyl ureas, e.g. maize). Also mentioned as herbicidf resistant (conventionally bred for herbicide tolerance) plants are those varieties marketed under| the name Clearfield® (e.g. maize). Naturally these statements also apply to plant varieties developed or marketed in the future with these genetic properties ("traits") or those developed in the future<br>
The use in (economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals is preferred, for example of cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar belt, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When used) in transgenic crops, in particular those which have resistances to insects, effects are frequently observed, in addition to the effects against harmful organisms to be observed in other crops, whidh are specific for application in the transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened spectrum of pests which can be controlled, or altered application rates which may be employed for application.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula I for controlling harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants,<br><br>

The abovementioned components for combinations are known active substances, many of which are described in Ch.R Worthing, S.B. Walker, The Pesticide Manual, 12th Edition, British Crop Protection Council, Farnham 2000,<br>
The effective use doses of the compounds employed in the invention can vary within wide limits, particularlyjdepending on the nature of the pest to be eliminated or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests. In general, the compositions according to the invention usually contain about Cj.05 to about 95% (by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about to about 95% of one or more solid or liquid carriers and, optionally, about 0.1 to about 50% of one! or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents or the like.<br>
hi the present account, the term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate its application, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil. This carrier is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example, agronomically acceptable, particularly to the treated plant).<br>
The carrier may be a solid, for example, clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, bentonite or diatomaoeous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as silica, alumina, or silicates especially aluminium or magnesium silicates. As solid carriers for granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite; synthetic granules of inorganic or organic meals; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs, corn husks or tobacco stalks; kiesjelguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork, or absorbent carbon black; water soluble polymers, tesins, waxes; or solid fertilizers. Such solid compositions may, if desired, contain one or more compatible wetting, dispersing, emulsifying or colouring agents which, when solid, may also serve is a diluent.<br><br>
Suitable as splid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and natural mineral powders such a kaolin, clays, talc, chalk, quartz attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and synthetic mineral powders such as highly dispersed sillca, aluminium oxide and silicates, suitable as carriers for granulates are: for example crushed and (fractionated natural minerals such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite as well as synthetic granulates of inorganic and organic flours as well as granulates from organic materials such 4s paper, sawdust, coconut shells, maize ears and tobacco stalks; suitable as emulsifiers and foaming agents are; for example non-ionogenic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethyl-ene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylarylpolyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkylsulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates; suitable as dispersant are non-ionic; and/or ionic materials, for example from the class of alcohol-POE and/or POP ethers, acid- and/or POP or POE esters, alkyl-aryl- and/or POP or POE ethers, fat- and/or POP or POE adducts, POE- and/or POP-polyol derivates, POE- and/or POP-sorbitan or sugar adducts, alkyl or aryl sulphates, sulphonates and phosphates or the respective PO ether adducts. In addition suitable oligo- or pojymers, for example starting from vinylic monomers, of acrylic acid, from EO and/or PO alone on in combination with, for example (poly)alcohols or (poly)amines. In addition lignin and its sulp|onic acid derivatives, simple and modified celluloses, aromatic and/or aliphatic sul-phonic acids as well as their adducts with formaldehyde can be used .<br>
Deposit builders such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic powdery, granular or latex-like polymers can be used in the formulations, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate as w£ll as natural phospholipids such a cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids.<br>
The carrier may also be liquid, for example: water; alcohols, particularly butanol or glycol, as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglycol acetate; ketones, particularly acetone, cyclohexa-none, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutylketone, or isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraf-finic or aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes; mineral or vegetable oils; aliphatjc chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or methylene chloride; aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or strongly polar solvents such 4s dimethylformarnide, dimethyl sulphoxide, or N-methylpyrrolidone; liquefied gases; or the like or a mixture thereof.<br>
The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or wetting agent of the ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents.<br><br>
Amongst these are e.g., salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acids, salts of phenolsul-phonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted phenols (particularly alkylphenols or arylphe-nols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates), phosphoric esters of alcohols or of polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, esters of fatty acids with polyols, or fulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the above compounds. The presence of lat least one surface-active agent is generally essential when the active ingredient and/or the inert carrier are only slightly water soluble or are not water soluble and the carrier agent of the composition for application is water.<br>
Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as adhesives or colorants. Adhesives Such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or (lattices, such as arabic gum, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phospholip-ids, such as! cephalitis or lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. It is possible to bse colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides or Prussian Blue; organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs; or trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.<br>
For their agricultural application, the compounds of the invention are therefore generally in the form of corhpositions, which are in various solid or liquid forms.<br>
20 Solid forms of compositions which can be used are dusting powders (with a content of the compound of the invention, ranging up to 80%), wettable powders or granules (including water dis-persible granules), particularly those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular carrier, or granulation starting from a powder (the content of the compound of the invention, in these wettable powders or granules being between about 0.5 and about 80%). Solid homogenous or<br>
25 heterogenous compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention, for example granules, pellets, briquettes or capsules, may be used to treat standing or running water over a period of time. A similar effect may be achieved using trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible concentrates as described herein.<br>
Liquid conjipositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions (such 30      as emulsiflable concentrates, emulsions, flowables, dispersions, or solutions) or aerosols. Liquid compositions also include, in particular, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables, aerosols, wettable powders (or powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as forms of<br><br>
compositions) which are liquid or intended to form liquid compositions when applied, for example as aqueous sprays (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols.<br>
Liquid compositions, for example, in the form of emulsifiable or soluble concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80% by weight of the active ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions whfch are ready for application contain, in their case, about 0.01 to about 20% of the active ingredient. Besides the solvent, the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required, about 2 to about 50% of suitable additives, such as stabilizers, surface-active agents, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives. Emulsions of any required concentration, which are particularly suitable for application, for example, to plants, may be obtained from these concentrates by dilution with water. These compositions are included within the scope of the compositions which may be employed in the present invention. The emulsions may be in the form of water-in-oil or oil-in-water type and they may have a thick consistency.<br>
The liquid compositions of this invention may, in addition to normal agricultural use applications be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or liable to infestation by arthropods (or other pests controlled by compounds of this invention) including premises, outdoor or indoor storage or processing areas, containers or equipment or standing or running water.<br>
All these aqjieous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be applied, for example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates which are generally of the order of about 100 to about! 1,200 liters of spraying mixture per hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon the need or application technique. The compound or compositions according to the invention are conveniently applied to vegetation and in particular to roots or leaves having pests to be eliminated. Another method of application of the compounds or compositions according to the invention is by chemigation, that is to say, the addition of a formulation containing the active ingredient to irrigation water. This irrigation may be sprinkler irrigation for foliar pesticides or it can be ground irrigation or underground irrigation for soil or for systemic pesticides.<br>
The concentrated suspensions, which can be applied by spraying, are prepared so as to produce a stable fluid (product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about (j.l to about 10% of thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesives and, as the carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or insoluble Some organjc solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to help prevent settling or as antifreezes fbr water.<br><br>
The wettable powers (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they contain from about 10 to about (80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to about 90% of a solid carrier, from about 0 to ahout 5% of a wetting agent, from about 3 to about 10% of a dispersing agent and, when necessary, from about 0 to about 80% of one or more stabilizers and/or other additives, such as penetrating  agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the like. To obtain these wettable powders, the active ingredient is thoroughly mixed in a suitable blender with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettable powders, the wettability and the suspendabilrty of which are advantageous. They may be suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be employed very advantageously in particular for application to plant foliage.<br>
The "water dispersible granules (WG)" (granules which are readily dispersible in water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the* wettable powders.<br>
They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient with the inert filler and a little water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous solution of a dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening).<br>
The rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary according to the method of application  or the nature of the compositions or use thereof. Generally speaking, the compositions for application to control arthropod or plant nematode pests usually contain from about 0.00001% to about 95%, more particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the compounds of the invention, together with other substances toxic to arthropods or plant nematodes, synergists, trace elements or stabilizers). The actual compositions employed and their rate of application will be selected to achieve the desired effect(s) by the fanner, livestock producer, medical or veterinary practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.<br>
Solid or liqjuid compositions for application topically to animals, timber, stored products or household goods usually contain from about 0.00005% to about 90%, more particularly from about 0.001% to about 10%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. For administration to animals prally or parenterally, including percutaneously solid or liquid compositions, these normally contain from about 0.1% to about 90% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Medicated feedstuff's normally contain from about 0.001% to about 3% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Concentrates or supplements for mixing with feedstuffs normally contain from about 5% to about 90%, preferably from about 5% to about 50%, by weight of<br><br>
one or more compounds of the invention. Mineral salt licks normally contain from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of one or more compounds of formula I or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Dusts or liquid compositions for application to livestock, goods, premises or outdoor areas may contain from (about 0.0001% to about 15%, more especially from about 0.005% to about 2.0%, by weight, of onje or more compounds of the invention. Suitable concentrations in treated waters are between about 0.0001 ppm and about 20 ppm, more particularly about 0.001 ppm to about 5.0 ppm. of one or more compounds of the invention, and may be used therapeutically in fish fanning with appropriate exposure times. Edible baits may contain from about 0.01% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 1.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention.<br>
When administered to vertebrates parenterally, orally or by percutaneous or other means, the dosage of compounds of the invention, will depend upon the species, age, or health of the vertebrate and upon the  nature and degree of its actual or potential infestation by arthropod or helminth pests. A single dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mg, preferably about 2.0 to about 20.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal or doses of about 0.01 to about 20.0 mg, preferably about 0.1 to about 5.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal per day, for sustained medication, are generally suitable by oral or parenteral administration. By use of sustained release formulations or devices, the daily doses required over a period of months may be combined and administered to animals on a single occasion.<br>
