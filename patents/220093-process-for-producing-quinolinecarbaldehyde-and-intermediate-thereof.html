Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing of quinolinecarbaldehydes; a p-ketoaldehyde derivative and a quinolinecarbaldehyde derivative, which are novel starting materials or intermediates for a production method thereof; The quinolinecarbaldehydes obtained by the present invention are useful as synthetic intermediates for pharmaceutical agents, agricultural chemicals and the like, for example, synthetic intermediates for quinoline type mevalolactone derivatives known as inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis. Background Art<br>
Conventionally, as production methods of quinolinecarbaldehydes, such as 2-<br>
cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carbaldehyde, there are known (1) a<br>
method comprising reducing the corresponding quinolinecarboxylic acid ester with a<br>
metal hydride of diisobutyl aluminum hydride and the like to give the corresponding<br>
quinolinecarbinol,	namely,	4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-cyclopropyl-3-<br>
hydroxymethylquinoline, and then oxidizing the compound using an oxidant such as pyridinium chlorochromate, oxalylchloride/dimethyl sulfoxide/tertiary amine (Swem oxidation), a sulfur trioxide pyridine complex and the like (e.g., JP-A-01-279866, JP-A-06-329540), and (2) a method comprising oxidizing 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-cyclopropyl-3-hydroxymethylquinoline using a hypohalite salt in a solvent such as dichloromethane and the like in the presence of a nitroxyl radical derivative (e.g., JP-A-08-27114) are known. However, the above-mentioned method (1) and method (2) both use the corresponding quinolinecarbinol as a starting material for the production<br><br>
of quinolinecarbaldehydes and oxidize the alcohol moiety to aldehyde, wherein the<br>
quinolinecarbinol    needs    to    be    obtained    by    reducing    the    corresponding<br>
quinolinecarboxylic acid ester, thus making the    steps complicated.    In addition,<br>
method (1) is associated with a problem of the treatment of effluent containing<br>
environmentally  harmful  chrome   ion  with  regard  to   the   use   of pyridinium<br>
chlorochromate as an oxidant, and a problem of side production of dimethyl sulfide<br>
having excessive odor in the Swem oxidation and oxidation using a sulfur trioxide<br>
pyridine complex. In addition, method (2) has problems in that it generally requires<br>
environmentally harmful halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane and the<br>
like as a solvent, and the like.<br>
Therefore, these methods are hardly industrially advantageous production<br>
methods of quinolinecarbaldehydes, and a method capable of producing efficiently<br>
and industrially advantageously in a short step has been desired.<br>
Moreover, as a P-ketoaldehyde derivative, which is one of the starting compounds<br>
in the production method of quinolinecarbaldehydes, which is the new invention<br>
described in the present specification, for example, 3-cyclopropyl-l,l-diethoxy-3-<br>
oxopropane is known, and this compound is produced by reacting sodium cyclopropyl<br>
formyl methyl ketone enolate withethanol in the presence of sulfuric acid (Ukr. Khim.<br>
Zh., Vol. 42, No. 4, p. 407 (1976)).<br>
However, this compound is poor in stability and, for example, ethoxy group undergoes p-elimination and enolization under basic conditions, and acetal moiety easily gets hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. Therefore, when this compound is used as a starting material, problems occur m that the compound is decomposed, the yield of the object compound decreases and the like. Thus, a P -ketoaldehyde<br><br><br>
According to the present invention, useful quinolinecarbaldehyde derivative (III) is obtained by a ring opening reaction of a quinoline ring using P-ketoaldehyde derivative (V) of a novel acetal type, instead of conventional p-ketocarboxylic acid ester (VIII). Quinolinecarbaldehyde derivative (HI) can easily yield the object quinolinecarbaldehydes (IV) under mild conditions. Consequently, the production step has become simple based on the novel route and the oxidization step of quinolinecarbinol (X) associated with environmental problems and odor problems can be avoided.<br><br>
The present inventors have conducted intensive studies and found a method of conveniently and industrially advantageously producing quinolinecarbaldehydes in a short step as ccmpared to conventional methods, and also found a p-ketoaldehyde derivative useful as a starting compound of the production method, which resulted in the conpletion of the present invention.<br>
