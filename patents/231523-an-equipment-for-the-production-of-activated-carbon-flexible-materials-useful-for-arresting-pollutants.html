				<td>The present invention relates to an equipment for the production of activated carbon<br>
flexible materials useful for arresting pollutants <br>
In the present context of global awareness and consequent action to bring down pollution in all spheres, it is very important to provide suitable materials which are useful for arresting pollutants.<br>
The process of preparing activated carbon from cloth has been described in an Indian patent (#175522 July 1995). The said patent is a laboratory demonstration of the treatment of a rayon cloth showing the effect of the processing parameters on the pores size and the effective surface area . The said patent uses the step of treating the cloth with organic solvents for initial cleaning for removing the impurities .The time periods used has been in the range of 1-24 hours. The next essential step described in the said patent is that of carbonisation and then separately of activation.<br>
In another patent (#US4256607) the oxidation of acrylonitrile based fibre has been done in a temperature range of 200 -300° C separately. Subsequently the oxidised fibre is activated from 700-1000° C for ten minutes to three hours.<br>
Both the above noted processes are essentially batch processes.<br>
To the best of our knowledge the equipment of the present invention is not in use in any industrial production line of textile mills, paper and printing etc<br>

The equipment of the present invention essentially consists of drives for pulling and feeding the material to be activated . The drives are located in the initial feeding station, after the drying chamber serving as the feeder to the reactor and at the end of the reactor for pulling the activated material. The drives are fixed in such a way that by changing the speed of the drive the shrinkage and the residence time of the flexible<br><br>
material can be taken care of. The tension of the flexible material can also be adjusted accordingly.<br>
The pre- treatment chamber can be of any convenient shape and any non corrosive material. The dimensions of the treatment chamber are of suitable value for the convenience of erection . By adjusting the level of the treatment solution and the speed of the drive the material can be treated in the chamber for different intervals. There is a facility to heat the treatment solution by suitable means provided external to the chamber. There is a facility for monitoring the pH and the temperature of the treatment solution.<br>
The chamber meant for drying the pre-treated flexible cloth is also made of non corrosive material of any suitable size and geometry. The air meant for drying, blows in the chamber through a set of heaters installed in a suitable enclosure. The fumes so generated are sucked and diluted in an exhaust tank placed outside the equipment area. The main component of the equipment of the present invention is the heating reactor for effecting carbonisation and activation of the flexible material. The reactor is an air tight chamber heated by heating elements such that the chamber is heated from room temperature till 1000°C at a desired rate of heating, and can be maintained at the said temperature for a long time with a constancy of ±5°C. The material of the reactor chamber is of a suitable high temperature resistant and non corrosive material. In the bottom of the chamber a provision is made for feeding the treated and dried cloth. The chamber is divided into two parts by baffles. In the chamber there is a facility to provide hot gas at the reaction zone. A facility is also provided to suck the waste gases by controlled flow so that the positive pressure is always maintained in the chamber. A suitable device is fixed external to the reactor chamber for measuring the pressure. The top of the reactor chamber is connected to a cooling l' tower with a set of flexible bellows . This is required to take care of the expansion /contraction of the chamber due to high temperature differentials. In the cooling tank the activated flexible material is cooled in inert atmosphere. The cooling tower and the bellows are also of non corrosive material and of any convenient shape<br><br>
and size for ease of erection and commissioning. There is a top enclosure attached to cooling tower for coiling the flexible material.<br>
The main process of the present invention for the production of the activated carbon flexible material is described hereunder.<br>
Initially typically a viscose rayon cloth of approximately 10 meters length was taken on the first feed roller. The cloth was fed to the pre treatment chamber for chemical treatment in a suitable oxidising agent maintained at a temperature in the interval of 97+ 3°C. The treatment was done for a period of at least 1 hour. The pre-treated material was fed continuously to the drying chamber maintained at a temperature of 97 ± 3 °C . The drying was done for a period of at least 30 mins . Thedried material was collected on a drive feeder.  Next the treated and dried material<br>
was stacked in a bottom enclosure of the reactor such that one end of the material is connected to the drive fixed on the top enclosure. The temperature of the reactor is raised approximately at the rate of 3 -8° C/hr. till a temperature of 1000° C and simultaneously the cloth is pulled approximately at the rate of 25-80cm/hr. Pulling of the material is done till end of the material is reached The temperature is maintained at 1000°C throughout the run. During the pulling process, gases are flown into the reactor at the desired places with the desired flow rates for effecting carbonisation and activation . The exhaust of the gases are maintained such as there is a positive pressure in the chamber.<br>
Tne following examples are given by way of illustrations of the equipment of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
