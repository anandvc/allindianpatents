				<td>FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention relates to the technology in time-division duplex mobile communication apparatus, and more particular, to a method for constructing a self-organizing network system or an emergency communication apparatus, concerning the application of commercial terminals in emergency systems, and a time-division duplex self-organizing mobile communication apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the third-generation mobile communication system, the users can perform high-rate data communication while moving in high speed. However, under some circumstances, due to the impact of geographical environment etc, it is impossible (or very difficult) to erect optical cable links or electric cable links between base stations and base station controller, leading to impossibility of constructing mobile communication system; under other circumstances, because of war or natural disasters such as earthquake or flood, optical cable links or electric cable links already erected between base stations and base station controller may be destroyed, paralyzing the whole wireless mobile communication system at the time when people most need a communication system.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the network architecture of an existing public mobile communication system. At present, all public mobile communication systems are constructed     according    to    the    architecture     illustrated     in     FIG.     1.<br>
In FIG. 1, base stations are denoted as triangles with n base stations altogether denoted as 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and Zn, respectively; while base station controllers (or radio network controllers) are denoted as rectangles with denoted as 20 and 21 respectively. The n base stations and the base station controller 20 in FIG. 1 are cable-connected (optical cable or electric cable) or wirelessly connected, as is shown in the figure with real lines 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 and An. Diamond oblique frames in the figure denote m user terminals as 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 and 5m.<br>
Each user terminal is wirelessly connected to a base station, then accesses to the core network 10 through the base station controller 20, thus establishing links with other terminals or other users outside the local network and realizing communications. Obviously, if a connection between a base station and the base station controller is disconnected, for example, 44, those user terminals covered by the corresponding base station 34 will be unable to get communication service.<br>
It is obviously of particular importance at this time to have an emergency<br>
communication system with mobility and fast self-organizing network, and this is<br>
exactly the concept of a self-organizing mobile communication system.<br>
Generally, self-organizing mobile communication systems are all special systems<br>
and require special user terminals, which accordingly increase the cost, and<br>
make common citizens inconvenient to enjoy mobile communications under<br>
special	circumstances.<br>
If it requires commercial terminals instead of special terminals, such an emergency communication system will be able to provide communications with outside for common citizens, breaking the constraints of previous emergency communication systems, decreasing the cost of terminals, and making it possible for common citizens to enjoy mobile communication service. Under special circumstances, it is much more likely for those in emergency to survive with such emergency communication system available.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for constructing a time-division duplex self-organizing mobile communication system, which uses international standards for mobile communications with only those for base stations and Radio Resource Management (RRM) modified so as to make the mobile communication service available to users with only terminals accessible to common public networks, and to lower network-constructing cost and promote wide-spread applications. A time-division duplex self-organizing mobile communication system is also disclosed by the present invention.<br>
The technical solution to serve the purpose of the present invention is as follows: a method for constructing a time-division duplex self-organizing mobile communication apparatus, comprising:<br>
A.	Searching for the pilot signals of adjacent area base stations in a manner<br>
similar to user terminals by a base station without direct connection to a base station<br>
controller, setting the local area covered by the base station as the next lower-level<br>
area of the adjacent area through responding to the pilot signals by the base station so<br>
as to form a subordinate relationship to the adjacent area, wherein, the adjacent area<br>
base station is either a first-level area base station with direct connection to the base<br>
station controller or a second or below-second-level area base station without direct<br>
but relayed connection to the base station controller;<br>
B.	Conducting relay communications by base stations at each above level,<br>
wherein the relay communication starting from a second or below-second-level area<br>
base station by a commercial user terminal covered by the second or below-second-<br>
level area base station, eventually establishing communications between the<br>
commercial user terminal and the base station controller in a public mobile<br>
communication system via a first-level area base station directly connected with the<br>
base station controller, and constructing a self-organizing mobile communication<br>
system by the base stations at each level.<br>
Wherein the conducting relay communications is:<br>
Conducting communication with multi time slot frame structure, wherein, the uplink frame and downlink frame structure of each time slot is set by the system: at least one pair of receiving time slot and sending time slot in the first-level area base station are used to exchange information with the next lower-level area base station, at least one pair of receiving time slot and sending time slot in the first-level area base station are used to exchange information with the common commercial user terminals covered by the first-level area base station; at least one pair of receiving time slot and sending time slot in a second or below-second-level area base station are used to exchange information with the next upper-level area base station and at least one pair of receiving time slot and sending time slot to exchange information with the common commercial user terminals covered by the second or below-second-level area base station, as well as one pair of receiving time slot and sending time slot are used to exchange information with its next lower-level area base station given that the second or below-second-level area base station is not a lowest-level area base station.<br>
Wherein the step A comprising:<br>
The base station without direct connection with the base station controller responds according to the magnitudes of the Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) of the pilot signals when receiving more than one pilot signals; the network side determines the subordinate relationship to the adjacent area.<br>
Wherein the conducting relay communications is:<br>

1.	Since the system can be constructed with board a board vehicle, an emergency<br>
communication system may be readily constructed under special circumstances such<br>
as war, earthquake or flood.<br>
2.	There is no requirement for special terminal devices and users can<br>
communicate with the outside by utilizing common commercial terminals (So far no<br>
emergency communication system can implement communication with the outside<br>
utilizing common commercial terminals).<br>

Embodiments of the Invention<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention are mainly with time-division duplex mobile communication systems. Now take TD-SCDMA, one of the three third-generation mobile communication standards, for example, the technical solution to modify space interface of TD-SCDMA will be presented. With proper changes, this<br>
technical solution may also be used as standards for other time-division duplex mobile communication systems.<br>
Shown in Figure 2 is the basic network architecture of a self-organizing mobile communication system of the present invention. Some base stations in the system (n in number), such as 221, 222 and 22n, are either cable-connected or wirelessly connected with the base station controller 20 (direct connection) in the same way as in Figure 1. These base stations are referred to as parent base station or first-level area base station. Other base stations (m in number), however, are not able to get direct connects with the base station controller 20, such as 231, 232, 233, 234 and 23m. These base stations can be of fixed positions, or vehicle-mounted ones.<br>
With the method of the present invention, base stations that are not directly connected with the base station controller 20, such as 231, may perform, through the use of space interface signaling and service signal transmission, a direct wireless relay communication with a parent or first-level area base station such as 222, or, a base station without direct connection with the base station controller 20, such as 234, may first perform relay communication with another base station also without direct connection with the base station controller 20, such as 233, then perform relay communication with a parent base station like 222 through the base station 233, so that the user terminals in the covering areas of base stations 233 and 234 will be fully operative and perform communication with the base station controller 20.<br>
As shown in figure 2, let us suppose that the covering area of each base station is hexagonal (sectorial, circle or other shapes). A cellular network then may be constructed by the base stations not directly connected to the base station controller. In the schematic diagram, since base stations 221, 222 and 22n are directly connected to the base station controller 20, the areas covered by them are referred to as first-level areas, wherein the signals are transferred in the air only once when the user terminals in the areas are communicating with the base station controller 20. Since user terminals in the areas covered by the base stations 231 and 232 have to first transmit information to the base stations of first-level areas through space interfaces, and then communicate with the base station controller 20 via first-level base stations, these areas are referred to as second-level areas, such as the areas 231, 232 and 233,<br><br>
wherein the signals are transmitted twice in the air when user terminals in the areas are communicating with the base station controller 20. Likewise, if the signals are transmitted three times in the air when a user is communicating with the base station controller 20, the area where the user is located will be referred to as a third-level area, such as the area 234. If the signals are transferred four times in the air when a user is communicating with the base station controller 20, the area where the user is located will be referred to as a fourth-level area, such as the area 23m, and the rest may be deduced in the same manner.<br>
Presented next is the constructing process of a self-organizing mobile communication system, which is summarized in three main steps:<br>
Step 1: constructing the self-organizing network system.<br>
When the connection (e.g. Iub interface) between the base station controller 20 and a base station, such as base station 222 in figure 2, is disconnected, or when a mobile base station without direct connection to the base station controller 20, such as base station 233, arrives at the prearranged location and is available, the base station 222 in the former situation and 233 in the latter situation will both work as a user terminal, searching for pilot signals of adjacent base stations, the process of which is the same as that of the local searching of a user terminal.<br>
When the base station 222 receives the pilot signals from a base station in an adjacent area, like 221, it will preset itself as second-level area, and respond to the pilot signal of the first-level area (area covered by the adjacent base station 221). If the base station 222 receives more than one pilot signals, the base stations sending these pilot signals may all become upper-level area base station 222. As base station 222 cannot determine by itself which one will be its upper-level area base station, base station 222 will respond to each pilot signal according to the SNR magnitude of the received pilot signals, and finally it is the network side that will determine the subordinate relationship between the base stations. This process of response is like the random accessing process of a user terminal, only the signaling is different.<br>
The first-level base station 221 may designate the area covered by the base station 222 as its sub-area (second-level area) after establishing communications with the base station 222. The second-level base station (like 231), if found as a parent base station by a base station like 233, will designate the area covered by 233 as its sub-area (third-level area), and the rest may be deduced in the same manner. Each sub-area may have only one parent area. Above-second-level areas may have either one sub-area, a number of sub-areas or none at all.<br>
Step 2: determining the frame structure of the time slot in uplink and downlink communications of the base stations at the first level and each other level.<br>
Since the technical solution of the present invention is applied to time-division duplex mobile communication system, multi time slot structure is required for communications of this kind of system. Furthermore, both uplink and downlink frame structure of each time slot can be set by the system. Taking TD-SCDMA standard as an example, whose frame structure is shown in figure 3A. The frame is comprised of 7 main time slot TSO, TS1, ..., TS6 with some special time slots set between TSO and TS1, namely Downlink Pilot Time Slot (DwPTS), Uplink Pilot Time Slot (UpPTS), and guard time slot G.<br>
In the constructed self-organizing network, definitions of TSO, TS1, TS4 and special time slots in the system frame structure for all areas (including parent areas and sub-areas at each level) are completely the same as those defined in TD-SCDMA standard.<br>
As is shown in Figure 3B, however, for first-level areas (parent base stations), TS2 in the system frame structure is a receiving time slot while TS5 is a sending time slot, and this pair of time slots are used for communicating with second-level areas (Communication between a parent base station and the base station controller is performed in either wire or wireless mariner), other time slots are used for exchanging information with common commercial user terminals in the areas which they covered .<br>
As for second-level areas, with reference to Figure 3C, TS5 in the system frame structure is a receiving time slot while TS2 is a sending time slot, and this pair of time<br>
slots are used for communicating with the first-level base stations; TS3 in the system frame structure is a receiving time slot while TS6 is a sending time slot, and this pair of time slots are used for communicating with the third-level base station. Other time slots are used for exchanging information with common commercial user terminals in the areas which the second-level area base stations cover.<br>
As for third-level areas, TS6 is a receiving time slot while TS3 is a sending time slot, and this pair of time slots are used for communicating with second-level area base stations; TS2 is a receiving time slot while TS5 is a sending time slot, and this pair of time slots are used for communicating with fourth-level area base stations. Other time slots are used for exchanging information with common commercial user terminals in the areas the third-level area base stations cover. The rest may be deduced accordingly with levels extending. However, with the increasing of times of signal transmitting in the air, time delay will increase as well, leading to poorer communication, which is thus not recommended.<br>
As for areas at the last level, since there is no need to exchange information with the lower-level area base station, no corresponding time slots are assigned. All time slots except the pair assigned for exchanging information with the next upper-level area base station may be used to exchange information with common commercial user terminals in the corresponding area.<br>
With the system frame structure set as above, TS1 and TS4 are used for communication between mobile terminals and base stations in the areas at each level; TS2, TS3, TS5 and TS6 are used for exchanging information between upper and lower level area base stations, or may be used for communication between mobile terminals and base stations in the areas at each level (depending on the network organized). Finally, mobile terminals in any area will be able to establish communication with the system controller.<br>
Step 3: modifying the radio resource manager (base station and base station controller).<br><br>
When a time-division duplex system for public mobile communication is involved in the self-organizing mobile communication system of the present invention, there will be new requirements as follows for system's RRM (Radio Resource Management):<br>
1.	For all areas, only some uplink and downlink time slots are used for<br>
communication between the local base station and user terminals since other uplink<br>
and downlink time slots will be used for communication between the local base<br>
station and base stations at the upper or lower level. For instance, with the TD-<br>
SCDMA standards, only one pair, at most two pairs of time slots may be used for<br>
providing service, namely, an area with single carrier wave can support 16 to 32 users<br>
at most. When larger user capacity is required, multi carrier wave has to be utilized.<br>
Since the transmission condition between base stations is much better than that between a base station and a user terminal, communication between base stations at different levels can be performed through high modulation mode, such as QPSK or 16QAM. In particular, with a TD-SCDMA system in use, transmitting power may be greatly reduced while transmission capability is improved since all base stations employ intelligent antenna. As each code channel of time slot can be dynamically allocated according to capacity requirement of areas at different levels, it is possible for the time slots used for communication between two base stations to provide connects for a number of lower-level area base stations.<br>
Each base station provides exchange service for communication between local users. Therefore, only signaling is required to transmit to the system in communication between local users while no service data required, which will greatly reduce the requirement for radio channels in space, thus increasing system capacity.<br>
As shown in figure 3A, in order to make common commercial terminals communicate with the outside through the emergency communication system, TSO, TS1, TS4 and special time slots in the system frame structure are completely the same as those defined in the TD-SCDMA standard.<br><br>
Since base stations need to communicate with one another, it is no longer the case as defined in the TD-SCDMA standard that there are only two receiving/sending switching points in the system frame structure (as is shown in figure 3A). Instead, there may appear a number of them as in the frame structure of a parent base station of the self-organizing system shown in figure 3B and in the frame structure of a second-level area base station shown in figure 3C. In figures 3A, 3B and 3C, the upward arrows in each time slot denote sending while downward arrows denote receiving. Switching points in the system frame structure of base stations at or below the third level may be deduced accordingly.<br>
It is significant that intelligent antenna are employed in TD-SCDMA, therefore, base stations are systems with multi-antennas and communications between base stations can be performed by sending and receiving via multi-antennas technology, which will greatly increase SNR and improve transmission efficiency. For instance, time slots TS2, TS3, TS5 and TS6 can be modulated in the mode of 16QAM.<br>
The self-organizing mobile communication system of the present invention is constructed based on time-division duplex mobile communication systems, especially based on TD-SCDMA third-generation mobile communication systems. By way of relay communication, it is made possible for user terminals within the area covered by a base station which is unable to link directly with the base station controller to communicate with the base station controller of the system. It is a useful extension of the third-generation mobile communication system, and is widely applicable to emergency communication and circumstance in which it is not easy to erect optical or electric cables.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
