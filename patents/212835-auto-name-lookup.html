AUTO NAME LOOKUP<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1001] This invention relates to looking up names, and has particular relation to looking up names in preparation for making a telephone call.<br>
Background Art<br>
[1002] Many modem telephones include stored telephone numbers. This feature is particularly useful in wireless telephones, where the user is likely to be away from a telephone book, or even a private list of numbers. Dialing the first few digits is sufficient. Pressing the "Send" button on the wireless telephone causes the telephone to search for the number and place the call<br>
BRIEF DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[1003] Applicants have noted that it is sometimes undesirable to press the "Send" button in order for the telephone to search for the complete number which is the best match the partial number entered. The wrong number may-be selected, and a (potentially expensive) phone call will have been begun. Wrong numbers are especially likely when it is unknown how many digits are in the number. A speed-dial number typically has two digits, a local number has seven, a long distance number has ten or eleven, and an international number has even more.<br>
[1004] Applicants therefore provide a plurality of lists, each of a different size. Each list includes several phone numbers. Each phone number in a list has a number of digits which is not less than a predetermined minimum number, and not more than a predetermined maximum number. The maximum number is the "size" of the list. The minimum and maximum may be the same if desired. When a sequence of digits is entered into the phone, the phone searches for telephone numbers in only one list, namely, the list whose size is equal to the number of digits entered. If no list is that size, then the selected list is the list whose size is the smallest, but still greater than the number of digits entered.<br><br>
[1005] If an additional digit is entered during a search, then the phone compares the new total number of digits with the available lists, and selects a new list if appropriate. If no additional digit is entered, then the search continues until it is complete, and the results are displayed. [1006] Preferably, the phone waits slightly between digits, so that searches will not be begun and then immediately be terminated by the entry of the next digit. Also, the phone can be commanded to include or exclude private numbers, to periodically check to see if more important functior\s are being inordinately delayed by a lengthy search, and to check for entry of a new digit while the correct list was being selected.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[1007]       FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the components typically used to carry<br>
out the present invention.<br>
[1008]       FIG. 2 is a flow chart showing the basic steps of a method using the<br>
present invention,<br>
[1009]      FIG, 3 is a more complex version of the flow chart of FIG. 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENT<br>
[1010] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of the components typically used to carry out the present invention. A user interface (102), such as a touch screen, or a keypad in conjunction with a monitor, is used to enter digits into the telephone, and also shows the telephone number or numbers which match the digits thus far entered. Software (104) accepts these digits, and matches the digits thus far entered with the phone numbers included in a plurality of lists (106), as described in greater detail below. The term "software," as used herein, includes any functionality which performs the functions ordinarily performed by software. The term therefore includes, but is not limited to, firmware, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and the <br>
[1011] FIG, 2 is a flow chart showing the basic steps of a method using the present invention. The user begins by entering a digit (lA). The phone compares (IB) the number of digits entered with a plurality of lists, and selects (IC) the list of' the smallest size whose size is greater than or equal to the<br><br>
number of digits selected. Since only one digit has been selected, the list would typically be the speed-dial list, of size two. That is, the speed-dial list is the list of two-digit codes for up to a hundred frequently called numbers. [1012] The phone then searches (ID) the selected list. When the search is complete (IDD), the phone displays the results. Preferably only the first matching result is displayed. Other preferences may be used as desired. [1013] If no additional digit is entered (IF) during the search process, then the search process (ID) continues. If an additional digit is entered, then the comparing (IB) and selecting (IC) steps must be repeated. Continuing with the previous example, suppose that 87 phone numbers (and associated names) have been entered into the speed-dial list, and have been given codes "01" through "87" Entering "2" preferably causes the name and number associated with code "02" to be displayed. Then entering "6" would preferably cause the name and number associated with code "26" to be displayed. The phone would preferably not search again the numbers which had been searched and rejected between the entry of "2" and the entry of "6".<br>
[1014] Suppose now that, "26" having been entered, the user additionally enters "3". The comparing and selecting steps now direct the phone to search the list of local numbers (each phone number in which has seven digits), and not the speed-dial list (each phone number in which has only two digits). If only local numbers are included, the list's size is seven, and long-distance numbers may be contained in a separate list of size ten. Alternatively, long¬distance and local numbers may be contained in a single list of size ten. The first number which includes the digits "263" is thus displayed. As before, the entry of yet more digits preferably does not cause the phone to re-start the search of local numbers from the beginning. That is, it preferably does not search again the numbers which have previously been searched and rejected, [1015] FIG. 3 is a more complex version of the flow chart of FIG. 2, and shows a number of desirable enhancementSs<br>
[1016] The first enhancement takes place between the digit entering step (lA) and the comparing/selecting steps (IBC). The phone waits (2A) for aiirst predetermined period. If, during this period, an additional digit is entered (2BC), the phone returns to the waiting step and re-initializes the period. If the period expires with no additional digit being entered, program flow proceeds to the number comparing step (IB). Furthermore, the determination of whether<br><br>
a new digit has been entered (IF) is followed (if a new digit actually has been entered) by the waiting step (2A), rather than proceeding directly to the comparing step (IB).<br>
[1017] The second enhancement causes the phone to treat public phone numbers and private phone numbers differently, if desired. The user at some time makes a determination as to whether all numbers, or only public numbers, are to be searched. He sets this determination (3A) into the phone, FIG. 3 shows this as taking place before the entry of the first digit (lA), and this is preferred, but this step may be taken at any time before searching is begun. The searching step (ID) of FIG. 2 now becomes a step (SBC) of searching all of the phone numbers, or only the public phone numbers, in the chosen list, depending on the determination set in the setting step (3A). [1018] The third enhancement addresses the possibility that the search may be lengthy, and that some other, higher priority function may become pending. Such functions might include such things as receiving an incoming phone call, or undertaking a handoff between two base stations. Thus, while the search is progressing (IDD), the phone determines if at least one other function is pending (4A). If it is, the function is executed (4B), If it is not, program flow proceeds to new digit entry determination step (IF).<br>
[1019] The final enhancement (5) is an error-trap inserted immediately after the list selection step (IC). If an additional digit is entered before the search even begins (ID), program flow loops back at least to the comparing step (IB) to make sure that the correct list has been selected. It preferably loops backs to a previous step, such as the waiting step (2A).<br>
