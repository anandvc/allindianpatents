OPTICAL SCANNING DEVICE AND IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS USING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART<br>
This invention relates to an optical scanning device and an image forming apparatus using the same.  The present invention is particularly suitably usable in an image forming apparatus such as a laser beam printer (LBP), a digital copying machine or a multifunction printer, for example, having an electrophotographic process.<br>
Conventionally, various proposals have bee made in regard to color image forming apparatuses which include a plurality of optical scanning devices each having light source means, deflecting means and an imaging optical system and in which light beams the plurality of optical scanning devices are directed onto a plurality cf image bearing members corresponding to these beams, respectively, to thereby produce a color image.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 12 - FIG. 14, a main structure and an optical function of a color image forming apparatus, as a comparative example, will be explained.<br>
The color image forming apparatus shown in FIG, 12 comprises independent image bearing members (hereinafter "photosensitive drums") 20<br><br>
corresponding to the colors of yellow, magenta, cyan and black.  Each photosensitive drum 20 is comprised of an  electric conductive member having a photosensitive layer applied thereto.  An electrostatic latent image is formed thereon by a light beam (laser beam) from an optical scanning device.<br>
In FIG. 12, denoted at 21 is an optical scanning device (scanning optical device) for projecting a light beam based on imagewise information having been applied thereto from an image reading apparatus or a personal computer.<br>
Denoted at 22 is a developing device for forming a toner image on the photosensitive drum with triboelectrically charged toner particles, and denoted at 23   is an intermediate transfer belt for conveying the toner image on the pr.c~osensitive drum to a transfer paper sheet.<br>
Denoted at 24 is a paper cassette for storing paper sheets on which toner images are to be produced, and denoted at 25 is a fuser fixing device for fusing on the paper sheet the toner image transferred to the paper sheet by heat.<br>
Denoted at 26 is a paper stacking tray on which the transfer paper sheet having a toner image fixed thereon is loaded.  Denoted at 27 is a cleaning device for cleaning any toner particles<br><br>
remaining on the photosensitive drum.<br>
In FIG. 12, with regard to the image formation, a light beam irradiated by laser emission based on the imagewise information from the optical scanning device is projected on the photosensitive drum, by which an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum which is being charged with electricity by means of a charging device.<br>
Afterwards, toner particles being triboelectrically charged within the developing device 22 are adhered to the electrostatic latent image, whereby a toner image is formed on the photosensitive drum.<br>
The toner image is then transferred from the photosensitive drum onto the intermediate transfer belt, and subsequently it is transferred again onto a paper sheet conveyed from the paper cassette mounted at the bottom of the main assembly, by which an image is formed on the paper sheet.<br>
The toner of the image thus transferred onto the paper sheet is fixed by the fixing device 25, and the paper sheet is discharged onto the stacking tray 25.<br>
FIG. 13 is a sub-scan sectional view which illustrates the image forming station of FIG.<br><br>
12.  In FIG. 13, the image forming station is comprised of two optical scanning devices SR and SL.  Since these two optical scanning devices SR and SL have a laterally symmetric structure with respect to an optical deflector 28, reference numerals are assigned to only one (optical scanning device SR) of them and description will be made to only the one.<br>
The optical scanning device in the diagram comprises a rotary polygonal mirror 28 (hereinafter, also "polygon mirror") for scanningly deflect a light beam (laser beam) emitted based on the imagewise information, and two f-e lenses 29 and 30 for performing constant-speed scan of the light beam and imaging the same into a spot-like shape on the photosensitive drum.<br>
Then, the light beam passed through the !-■=■ lanses 29 and 30 advances via a plurality of reflecting mirrors 31a - 31d for reflecting light toward a predetermined direction and passes through dustproof glass 32 for protecting the optical scanning device from dust.<br>
Then, an   electrostatic   latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum surface by the light beam passed through the dustproof glass 32.<br>
In this type of optical scanning devices, in the trend toward smallness in size of<br><br>
the image forming apparatus, a method of scanning and exposing four photosensitive drums with the use of one polygon motor unit such as shown in FIG. 13 has been adopted.<br>
This method uses two optical scanning devices SR and SL for projecting a plurality of light beams toward opposed, surfaces of the polygon mirror 28,   respectively.<br>
Each optical scanning device SR or SL projects two light beams, mutually shifted in parallel by a predetermined distance in the vertical direction, upon the deflecting surface (reflection surface) of the polygon mirror 28 to carry out the deflective scan.<br>
There are two pieces of f-9 lenses 29 and 30 provided to image these light beams of the upper and lower light paths, upon the phoz"Sensitive drums, respectively.<br>
Each of these two f-9 lens 29 and 30 has the same lens surface at two vertical levels, that is, at the upper and lower surface portions thereof.  Such f-9 lens can be made by cementing two lens pieces, or it can be made by integral molding as a molded lens.<br>
In the optical scanning device having two vertical levels such as described above, it is necessary to use a deflecting surface for<br><br>
scanningly deflecting light beams to the upper and lower light paths, respectively.  Thus, a large-thickness polygon mirror or a polygon mirror having two-level structure has been used.<br>
In such structure, the load of the motor which drives a large-size polygon mirror has to be large.<br>
In contrast thereto, a color image forming apparatus in which the polygon mirror has a thinner thickness is illustrated in FIG. 14.<br>
In FIG. 14, the image forming station is comprised of two optical scanning devices SR and SL.  Since these two optical scanning devices SR and SL have a laterally symmetric structure with respect to an optical deflector 33, reference numerals are assigned to only one (optical scanning device SR) of them and description will be ~=.6.-e   to only the one.<br>
In this case, a polygon mirror 33 is made thinner by making light beams incident on a deflecting surface 33a of the polygon mirror 33, at different angles (oblique incidence) in the sub-scan section (oblique incidence optical system).<br>
After being scanningly deflected by the polygon mirror 33, the light beams go through two common f-e lenses 35 and 3 6.<br><br>
Therif one (U) of the light beams passed through the f-9 lenses 35 and 36 is directed to a photosensitive drum 38a via two reflecting mirrors 34a and 34c and one piece of concave mirror 34b.<br>
Furthermore, the other (L) of the light beams passing through the f-0 lenses 35 and 36 is directed to a photosensitive drum 38b via two reflecting mirrors 34d and 34f and one piece of concave mirror 34e.<br>
In the drawing, the separation of the light paths of the light beams is carried out by use of a reflecting mirror 3'4d which is disposed in the middle of the light path.<br>
More specifically, the light beam L which deflectively scans the lower part in the drawing is reflected by the reflecting mirror 3d upwardly in the drawing so that it intersects with the light beam U which deflectively scans the upper part in the drawing.  Then, the light beam L is directed to the photosensitive drum 38b by means of a plurality of reflecting mirrors 34c and 34f which are disposed in the upper portion of an optics box.<br>
In FIG. 14, as described above, a plurality of reflecting mirrors are used to direct a plurality of light beams to corresponding photosensitive drum surfaces (see Patent Documents<br><br>
Nos.1-6 below).<br>

Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.<br>
2004-317790<br>
The color image forming apparatus having been described above as a comparative example involves various problems to be mentioned below.<br>
The first problem is that it needs a great many reflecting mirrors to lead the light<br><br>
beam to the photosensitive drum.<br>
For example, in FIG. 13, three pieces of reflecting mirror 31b, 31c and 31d are used in all over the same light path.<br>
Furthermore, in FIG. 14 as well, it uses three pieces of reflecting mirror 34a, 34b and 34c (34d, 34e and 34f&gt; in all over the same light path.<br>
This results in complexity of the device due to the increased component number of items and also it leads to the necessity of the space for accommodating the mirrors.  It causes enlargement in size of the overall system.<br>
In contrast to this. Patent Document No. 1 proposes a method of reducing the height of the optical scanning device in the sub-scan direction and also for reducing the number of pieces of the refleering mirrors.<br>
In this approach, the light paths are designed specifically and, while taking into consideration of the size of imaging lens, the light paths are extended so as to avoid the imaging lens.<br>
Furthermore, Patent Document No. 3 proposes a method of reducing the height of the optical scanning device in the sub-scan direction.<br>
In this Patent Document No. 3,<br><br>
reduction of the height of the device is attempted while taking into account the reflection angle of the reflecting mirror, the distance from the imaging lens to the reflecting mirror, and the height of the imaging lens.  Particularly, it is stated that, by limiting the height of the imaging lens with to 6 - 10 mm, the reflection angle of the light path can be lowered.<br>
However, if the height of the imaging lens is lowered in a case of a lens made of a resin [hereinafter, also "resin lens") which has been used generally for the imaging lens, the following problems will be raised.<br>
In a resin lens molded by using a mold, if the lens height is lowered with respect to the thickness of the lens optical axis direction, during the cooling process just after the lens is disengaged from the mold, cooling occurs and progresses from the upper and lower portions of the lens.<br>
As a result of this, a refractive index distribution and a birefringence distribution are easily created inside the lens, within the sub-scan section (lens height direction).<br>
As a result of this, the imaging performance in the sub-scan direction will increase remarkably.  It can be said therefore<br><br>
rhat it is practically difficult to reduce the lens height as proposed in Patent Document No. 3.<br>
Furthermore, in an oblique incidence optical system such as shown in FIG. 14, there is another problem that, due to oblique incidence of a light beam on an f-9 lens (imaginq lens) in the sub-scan section, the aberration is deteriorated and the spot imaging performance is degraded. Furthermore, the scanning line on the scan surface is curved.<br>
In contrast to this, in Patent Document No. 6, as shown in FIG. 10 which illustrates a third embodiment, the power allocation of the f-9 lens of two-piece structures, in the sub-scan direction, is concentrated to the second f-B lens, and also the second f-9 lens is shifted in the sub-scan section relative to the light beam.<br>
With this arrangement, reduction of the deterioration of aberration and reduction of the quantity of scan line curve are realized.<br>
With regard to the light path setting, as shown in FIG. 13 of the bulletin, the light path is extended to surround the lens.<br>
In Patent Documents Nos. 4 and 5, like Patent Document No. 6, a portion of the f-6 lens is shifted relative to the light beam, in the sub-scan section.<br><br>
These structures are adopted to avoid the surface reflsction ghost of the imaging lens, and there is an assumption that all the imaging lenses to be shifted have a curvature in the sub-scan direction as well as a power.<br>
Patent Documents Nos. 4 and 5 do not fully discuss the approach for reduction in size of the overall system.<br>
Patent Document No. 2 discloses an example wherein an imaging lens is tilted by around 1 to 4 degrees to prevent the ghost, and an example wherein, after directing a scanning light beam through an imaging lens twice, the light beam is obliquely incident within the sub-scan section to separate the light path.<br>
Then, like Patent Document No. 6, definition of the reflection angle of a cylinder mirrcr is attempted to reduce the deterioration of the spot imaging performance and scan line curve due to the obligue incidence.<br>
However, Patent Document 2 does not fully discuss the light path extension for reduction in size of the overall system.<br>

The term 'sub-scan section" refers to a plane with respect to which the main-scan direction (Y-direction) is a normal.<br>
In FIG. 1 - FIG. 3, the image forming apparatus comprises two optical scanning devices SR and SL.  Since these two optical scanning devices SR and SL have a laterally symmetric structure with respect to an optical deflector 5 and they have the same optical function, the following description will be made mainly with regard to the optical scanning device SR.<br>
In these diagrams, denoted at 1 is light source means which comprises a semiconductor laser.  Denoted at 2 is a condenser lens (collimator lens) which serves to convert a div=rger_ light beam emitted from the light source means 1 into a parallel light beam.<br>
It should be noted that the incident light beam on the condenser lens 2 is not limited to a parallel light beam, but it may be a convergent light beam or a divergent light beam.<br>
Denoted at 3 is an aperture stop which restricts a light beam passing therethrough to shape the beam profile.  Denoted at 4 is a cylindrical lens which has a predetermined powet<br><br>
only in the sub-scan section (sub-scan direction) . It functions to image, in the sub-scan section, the light beam passed through the aperture stop 3 as a line image upon the deflecting surface (reflection surface) 51 of the deflecting means 5 to be described below.<br>
It should be noted that the condenser lens 2 and the cylindrical lens 4 may be constituted integrally as a single optical element (anamorphic lens).<br>
Furthermore, the elements such as the condenser lens 2, aperture stop 3 and cylindrical lens 4 are components of an input optical system LA which makes the light beam from the light source means be incident on the deflecting means 5.<br>
Denoted at 5 is an optical deflector as deflecting means (polygon mirror), having a six-surface s-ructure.  I~ scanningly deflects the light beam from the light source means 1.<br>
The optical deflector 5 is rotationally operable and, through the rotational motion at a constant speed in a predetermined direction made by a motor, not shown, it scans the scan surface II in the main-scan direction.<br>
Denoted at LB is an imaging optical system (f-S lens system). The imaging optical system LB in the present embodiment is comprised<br><br>
of a plurality of (two in this example) transmission type imaging optical elements (first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8) for directing the light beam from the optical deflector 5 to the scan surface 8.<br>
The imaging optical system LB functions to image, into a spot, the light beam based on the imagewise info-rmation and scanningly deflected by the optical deflector 5 which is being rotated, upon a photosensitive drum surface 11 as the scan surface, within the main-scan section (main-scan direction).<br>
Furthermore, it serves to provide an optically conj ugate relationship between the deflecting surface 51 of the rotating optical deflector 5 and the photosensitive drum surface 11, in the sub-scan section, thereby to accomplish surface tilt compensation.<br>
Denoted at 7 and 9 are first and second reflecting mirrors each for folding the light path. These mirrors are disposed along the light path between the optical deflector 5 and the scan surface 11.<br>
Of the first and second reflecting mirrors 7 and 9, the first reflecting mirror 7 which is the reflection type optical element optically nearest to the optical deflector 5 is<br><br>
located between the first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8 {two transmission type imaging optical elements).<br>
The first and second reflecting mirrors 7 and 9 as the reflection type optical elements are comprised of a plane mirror having no power.<br>
It should be noted that, in the present embodiment, the word "optical" means the direction in which a light beam advances.<br>
Denoted at 10 is a cover glass, and denoted at 11 is a photosensitive drum surface as the scan surface.<br>
Denoted at 61 is a central line of the contour (outer configuration) of a holding frams (not shown) of the transmission type imaging optical element, which holding frame is arranged to hold the imaging lens as an optical element. Denoted az 14 is a light beam (scan light beam) scanningly deflected by the deflecting surface 51. Denoted at 15 is a light path as reflected by the first mirror 7.  Denoted at 67 is a gate.<br>
The optical scanning device of the present embodiment is a deflection in-plane scanning system in which the scan is made within a plane perpendicular to the deflecting surface of the optical deflector (polygon mirror) 5, in the sub-scan section as shown in FIG. 1.<br><br>
Thus, the input optical system LA extending from the light source means 1 to the cylindrical lens 4 is disposed within the sheet of the drawing which corresponds to the deflecting surface, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Furthermore, the light beam being incident on the deflecting surface 51 of the optical deflector 5 is incident with a limited angle with respect to the optical axis of the imaging optical system LB, within the main-scan section.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, as can be seen from FIG. 2, identical optical scanning devices 3R and SL are disposed at the right-hand side and left-hand side of the optical deflector 5, and this optical deflector 5 is used in common for both of them to scan a plurality of scan surfaces.<br>

Here, the expression is defined as follows.<br>
The lens form {toric shape} comprises an aspherical shape which can be expressed by a function up to the tenth order with respect to the<br><br>
main-scan direction.  Where the point of intersection with the optical axis is taken as an origin, the optical axis direction is taken as an X-axis, an axis in the main-scan section and orthogonal to the optical axis is taken as a y-axis, and an axis in the sub-scan section and orthogonal to the optical axis is taken as a z-axis, the meridional direction corresponding to the main-scan direction is expressed by:<br><br>
wherein R is the curvature radius, and K, B4, Bg, Be and Bio sre aspherical coefficients.<br>
The sagittal direction corresponding to the suJo-scan direction (a direction including the optical axis and orthogonal to the main-scan direction) is expressed by:<br><br>
rO is the sagittal curvature radius on the optical axis, and D2, D4, Dg, Dg and Dio are coefficients. Furthermore, in the tables: The focal length of the first imaging lens in<br><br>

r'urthermore, in the tables, the symbol "e-X" means "xlO~".<br>
In the present embodiment, the divergent light beam emitted from the semiconductor laser 1 is converted into a parallel light beam by the condenser lens 2.  Then, the light beam (light quantity) is restricted by the aperture stop 3, and thereafter it is incident on the cylindrical lens 4.<br><br>
Inside the main-scan section, the liaht beam incident on the cylindrical lens 4 emerges therefrom without being changed, and impinges on the deflecting surface 51 of the optical deflector 5.<br>
Inside the sub-scan section, on the other hand, the light beam is further converged and imaged as a line im.age (a line image extending in the main-scan direction) upon the deflecting surface 51 of the rotating optical deflector 5.<br>
Here, the light beam from the input optical system LA is perpendicularly incident on the deflecting surface of the optical deflector 5 in the sub-scan section, and it is focused on the deflecting surface 51.<br>
Furthermore, the light beam being incident or. the deflecting surface 51 of the op-ical deflector 5 is incident with a   limited angle with respect to the optical axis of the imaging optical system LB in the main-scan section.<br>
Then, the light beam scanningly deflected by the deflecting surface 51 of the optical deflector 5 passes through the first imaging lens 6; then it is reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7; then it passes through the second imaging lens 8; then it is reflected by the second reflecting mirror 9; and finally it is<br><br>
imaged into a spot shape on the photosensitive drum surface 11.<br>
In this way, the image recording is carried out on the photosensitive drum surface 11 as a recording medium.<br>
Next,-the optical function of the imaging optical system LB which is comprised of first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8, will be explained.<br>
In the present embodiment, the first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8 are made of resin (plastic).<br>
The imaging optical system LB images the light beam scanningly deflected by the optical deflector 5 upon the scan surface 11 to form a beam spot thereon and to scan the scan surface 11 at a constant speed.<br>
he imaging lens made of resin is produced by a known molding technique of filling a die with resin and removing it out of the die after cooling.<br>
In this way, the imaging lens can be produced more easily as compared with a conventional imaging lens based on a glass lens.<br>
As shown in Table 1, the first imaging lens 6 having a power (refracting power) mainly in the main-scan direction has an aspherical surface<br><br>
shape having a lens form being expressed by the function of the equation given above.<br>
In the present embodiment, the first imaging lens 6 (transmission type imaging optical element A) whose distance between the light path 15 reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7 as a reflection type optical element and the outer circumferential" portion of one of the holding frames (not shown) for the transmission type imaging optical elements, holding a plurality of imaging lenses, is shortest has a smaller power in the sub-scan direction than the power in the main-scan direction.<br>
Also, the first imiaging lens 5 is comprised of a meniscus shaped lens (meniscus lens) having a non-arcuate shape in the main-scan section and having a concave surface facing to the cpztcal   deflector 5 side.<br>
Furthermore, the shape of the first imaging lens 6 in the main-scan section is symmetric with respect to the optical axis.<br>
Furthermore, with regard to the sub-scan direction, the light entrance surface and the light exit surface thereof have no power and have the same curvature.  However, both surfaces may have a cylindrical shape being flat in the sub-scan direction.<br><br>
It provides ar_ imaging function mainly in the main-scan direction, relative to the incident light beam.<br>
The holding frame is formed integrally with the transmission type imaging optical element through a molding process.  However, the holding frame may be formed separately from the transmission type imaging optical element.<br>
On the other hand, the second imaging lens 8 is an anamorphic lens having a power mainly in the sub-scan direction, as shown in Table 1. The lens form is an aspherical surface shape as expressed by the function of the equation given above.<br>
The second imaging lens 8 has a larger power in the sub-scan direction (in the sub-scan section) than the power in the main-scan direction ;±r -he main-scan section). Also, the light entrance surface thereof in the main-scan section has an arcuate shape, and the other surface has a non-arcuate shape.<br>
The shape in the main-scan section is symmetric with respect to the optical axis, and it has no power in the main-scan direction, on the axis .<br>
With regard to the shapes in the sub-scan section, the light entrance surface has a<br><br>
flat surface having an extraordinarily slow curvature, whereas the light exit surface has a convex shape in which the curvature changes gradually from the optical axis to the outside the optical axis, and the shape is symmetric with respect to the optical axis.<br>
For the light beam incident thereon, this lens has a function of imaging in the sub-scan direction and a function of slightly correcting the distortion in the main-scan direction.<br>
With regard to the imaging relationship in the sub-scan direction of the imaging optical system L3 which is comprised of the first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8, it provides a what can be called a surface tilt correction system in which the deflecting surface 51 and the scan surface 7 5.re in a conjugate relationship.<br>
It is to be noted that the imaging optical system LB should not always be a function expression as shown in the Table 1, but it may be a known expression.<br>
Furthermore, it may have an asymraetric shape with respect to the optical axis, for further improved imaging performance.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, after the light beam {scan light beam) 14<br><br>
scanningly deflected by the deflecting surface SI is incident on the first imaging lens 6, it is reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7.<br>
Within the sub-scan section, the first imaging lens 6 is so disposed that, to avoid interference with the light path reflected by the reflection optical element, the contour central line 61 of holding frame (not shown) of the transmission type imaging optical element is located at a side of the central line (principal ray) of the light beam incident on the first imaging lens 6, which side is remote from the reflected light path 15.<br>
Namely, in this embodiment, by shifting the first imaging lens 6 in a direction perpendicular to the scan light beam 14 and only by a physical distance (shift amount) dZ to be described belo"*;, the interference between the reflected light path 15 and the first imaging lens 6 is avoided.<br>
Based on this avoidance of interference, the reflection angle 9 at the first reflecting mirror 7 can be made small, and this contributes to the reduction in height of the device in the sub-scan direction.<br>
It should be noted that, as shown in Table 1, the curvature radius r of the first<br><br>
imaging lens 6 in the sub-scan direction is 1000, and this lens is so designed that the vertex thereof coincides with the contour central line 61.<br>
In this embodiment, if the angle defined between the principal ray of the light beam reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7 and a normal to the first reflecting mirror 7 is denoted by 9, the following condition is satisfied.<br>
e 
The conditional expression (3) specifies the reflection angle Q   reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7.<br>
If the upper limit of the conditional exoression (3) is exceeded, it does not contribute to reduction in size of the overall system any ricrs.  Namely, if the reflection angle S exceeds 4 5 degrees, tne angle defined betveen the principal ray of the scan light beam 14 and the reflected light path 15 becomes larger than 90 degrees and thus the compactness in the horizontal direction will be lost.<br>
Therefore, the reflection angle 9 had better be set not greater than 45 degrees.<br>
Preferably, the aforementioned conditional expression (3) had better be set as<br><br>
follows.<br>
G 
In the present embodiment, as shown in Table 1, e = 7.3 degrees.  This satisfies the conditional exprsssion (3) as well as the conditional expression (4).<br>
Furthermore, in the present embodiment, if the height of the outer configuration of the holding frame of the transmission type imaging optical element which holds the first imaging lens 6 is denoted by H, and the physical distance (shift amount) from the contour central line 61 to the principal ray of the incident light beam (scan light beam) 14 is denoted by dZ, then the following condition is satisfied.<br>
0.05 
The conditional expression (5) concerns the ratio between the physical distance from the contour central line 61 to the incident light beam 14 and the height of the contour.<br>
If the conditional expression (5) is not satisfied, the light path extension becomes difficult to do.  Also, it becomes difficult to<br><br>
reduce height of the device in the sub-scan direction.<br>
More preferably, the conditional expression (5) had better be set as follows.<br>
0.07 
In the present embodiment, H =   13.0 mm and dZ = 1.5 mm.  Thus, dZ/H = 0.115.  This satisfies the conditional expression (5) as well as the conditional expression (6).<br>
In the present embodiment, as can be seen from FIG. 3, the height of the device in the sub-scan direction can be reduced by making the angle 6 small.<br>
Here, the first imaging lens 6 should be shifted in a direction perpendicular to the sea- lighz bea 14 to avoid interference between the reflected light path 15 and the first imaging lens 6 .<br>
Although the height reduction effect can be enhanced if the shift amount dZ is made larger, the largest possible shift amount is 1/2 of the lens height H, and this determines the upper limit of the conditional expression (5) .<br>
Furthermore, in a resin lens which is molded by a die, if the lens height is made low as<br><br>
compared with the lens thickness in zhe   optical axis direction, during the cooling process just after the lens is disengaged from the mold, cooling occurs and progresses from the upper and lower portions of the lens.<br>
As a result of this, a refractive index distribution and a birefringence distribution are easily created ins-ide the lens, within the sub-scan section (lens height direction).<br>
It is known that this influence becomes more remarkable as the distance from the central axis of the lens contour becomes larger and that the imaging performance degrades steeply from around two-thirds (2/3) of the span from the contour center to the outer peripheral edge.<br>
Therefore, if the imaging performance of the device is a priority, the ratio should preferably 5£-f3fy QZ/H 
The upper limit of the conditional expression (6) specifies this.<br>
The lower limit of the conditional expressions (5) and (5) defines the lower limit of the shift amount of the first imaging lens 6.<br>
If the shift amount is small, the effect of interference prevention of the interference between the reflected light path 15 and the first imaging lens 6 become insufficient.<br><br>
and the interference would occur if the position of the reflected light path 15 or the position of the first imaging lens 6 varies because of the tolerance at the time of the assembly.<br>
In the present embodiment, as described above, the power of the first imaging lens 6 in the sub-scan direction is made smaller than the power thereof in the main-scan direction.<br>
Here, the light beam width of the light beam reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7 is taken as La, and that the distance from the first imaging lens 6 to the first reflecting mirror 7 is taken as L.<br>
Furthermore, the reflection angle defined between the principal ray of the light beam reflected by rhe first reflecting mirror 7 and a normLal zo   the first reflecting mirror 7 is ■cs5:er_ =5 5, and the height of the contour of the holding frame of the transmission type imaging optical element is taken as H.<br>
Then, the shift amount dZ of the first imaging lens 6 should preferably satisfy the following condition.<br>
5 
The conditional expression (7) is a<br><br>
condition for specifying the shift amount d2 of the first imaging lens 6.<br>
If the conditional expression (7) is not satisfied, the effect of interference prevention of the Interference between the reflected light path 15 and the first imaging iens 6 becomes insufficient, as like the conditional' expression (5), and the interference would occur if the position of the reflected light path 15 or the position of the first imaging lens 6 varies because of the tolerance at the time of the assembly.<br>
In this embodiment, if the power of the first imaging lens 6 (transmission type imaging optical element C) in the sub-scan section is denoted by tpi, and the power of the imaging optical system LB in the sub-scan section is den "Ted by 9=1;:, the following condition is satisfied.<br>
Icpi/tpalll  0.01	... CD<br>
The conditional expression (1) is a condition for specifying the ratio between the power of the imaging lens 6 in the sub-scan direction (l/"focal length") constituting the imaging optical system LB and the power (l/"focal<br><br>
length") of the imaging optical system LB.<br>
Namely, the condi'cional expression (1) specifies that the power ratio of the first imaging lens 5 is set to be smaller than a specified amount.<br>
If the power ratio of the first imaging lens 6 becomes large beyond the upper limit of the conditional expression (1), the aberration will deteriorate when the power ratio of the first imaging lens 6 is shifted in parallel relative to the optical axis, as described above, such that spot diameter deterioration and scan line curve will occur.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Table 1, there is a relation:<br><br>
This satisfies the conditional expression (1).<br>
More preferably, the conditional expression (1) had better be set as follows.<br><br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, if the curvature radii of the first imaging lens 6 at the<br><br>
optical deflector side end -che scan surface side are denoted by Rl and R2, respectively, the following condition is satisfied.<br>
11/R11+I1/R21 
The conditional expression {2} is a condition for specifying the curvature of the first imaging lens 6, constituting the imaging optical system LB, in the sub-scan direction.<br>
Namely, the conditional expression [2] specifies that the curvatures of the light entrance surface and the light exit surface of the first imaging lens 6, in the sub-scan direction, are set to be smaller than a specified amount.<br>
If the curvature of the light entrance surface and the light exit surface of the first izragi—c lens € ir, the sub-scan direction becomes large beyond the upper limit of the conditional expression (2), the aberration will deteriorate when the power ratio of the first imaging lens 6 is shifted in parallel relative to the optical axis, as described above, such that spot diameter deterioration and scan line curve will occur.<br>
The light entrance surface and the light exit surface are comprised of an optical surface (lens surface).<br><br>
In the present embodiment as shown in Table 1, there is a relation:<br>
[1/R1I + I1/R2I = 2.0E-03 (l/rrm)<br>
This satisfies the conditional expression (2).<br>
More preferably, the conditional expression (21 had better be set as follows.<br>
0.0010{l/mm) 
... (2al<br>
It is a feature of the present embodiment that, as described above, of the imaging lenses constituting the imaging optical system LB, the first imaging lens 6 having a very EELall "Dower ir_ -he s"o.b-scan direction is shifted in the sub-scan section relative to the scan light beam 14.<br>
It should be noted that the power of the first imaging lens 6 in the sub-scan direction may be zero (non-power).<br>
Furthermore the curvature of the first imaging lens 6 is very slow as described above. Therefore, even if it shifts in the sub-scan section, the Fresnel reflected light which occurs<br><br>
at the lens surface of ~he firsz imaging lens 5 goes back to the optical deflector 5.<br>
In consideration of this, in the present embodiment, a sufficient distance is secured between the optical deflector 5 and the first imaging lens 6 and, furthermore, the thickness of the optical deflector 5 in the height direction thereof is kept to 2 mm or less.  Thus, the structure is configured to avoid adverse influence of the Fresnel reflected light which might otherwise cause flare or ghost light.<br>
Furthermore, a coating may be provided on the lens surface of the first imaging lens 5.<br>
On the other hand, in the present embodiment as described above, of the first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8, the first imaging lens 6 (transmission type imaging optical element C) Br_lch has a snail est power or zero power in "the sub-scan direccion is shifted in the sub-scan section relative to the scan light beam 14.<br>
With this arrangement, in this embodiment, adverse influences on aberration deterioration and scan line curve are reduced.<br>
In this embodiment, the first imaging lens 6 is shifted in the sub-scan direction by a physical distance dZ - 1.5 mm, by which the drift of the scan line curve is suppressed to about 1 jim<br><br>
or less, which is a level T,hat can be disregarded.<br>
Furthermore, in the present embodiment as described above, 'che first reflecting mirror 7 is provided to be located on the light path between the first imaging lens 6 and the second imaging lens 8.<br>
With this arrangement, in this embodiment, the size of the system can be made small in both of the horizontal direction and vertical direction.<br>
If the first reflecting mirror 7 as a reflection type optical element is provided after the second imaging lens 8, the width in the horizontal direction becomes large.<br>
Furthermore, if the first reflecting mirror 7 as a reflection type optical element is proTided at the light path between the first imacing lens € and che optical deflector 5, the size in the vertical direction cannot be made small, though the size in the horizontal direction can be made small.<br>
Therefore, for smallness in size in both of the horizontal direction and vertical direction, the first reflecting mirror 7 should preferably be provided on the light path between the first imaging lens 6 and the second imaging lens 8.<br><br>
In zhis embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, optical scanning devices SR and SL having the same structure are provided at the right and left of the optical deflector 5, symmetrically with respect to the plane including the rotational axis of the optical deflector 5, and the optical deflector 5 is used in common for scanning a plurality of scan surfaces.<br>
However, the reflection angle of the second reflecting mirror 9 is different between the optical scanning devices SR and SL, as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The reflection angle of the second reflecting mirror 9 may be set appropriately in accordance with the component disposition of the image forming apparatus.<br>
In rhe present embodiment as described above, wizh the structure explained above, the interference between the light beam reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7 and the first imaging lens 6 can be avoided.  Therefore, the number of reflecting mirrors to be used can be reduced, and a compact structure of an optical scanning device is accomplished.<br>
Furthermore, since in this embodiment the power of the first imaging lens 6 in the sub-scan direction which is lens to be shifted is made<br><br>
low, by which deterioration of aberration due to the shift can be suppressed and a good imaging state of the spot can be held.<br>
Furthermore, in the present embodiment, in both of the left-hand side and right-hand side imaging optical systems LB as shown in FIG. 2, gate members (gates) 67 for the first imaging lenses 6 are provided in the same direction.<br>
By providing the gate members 57 in this way, the same components can be used for the left-hand side and right-hand side imaging lenses 6 and 8.<br>
It should be noted that the present embodiment may use light source means (multi-beaip, light source) having a plurality of light emitting members (light emission points).<br>

The expressions in the present embodiment are similar to the expressions in the abovementioned first embodiment.  Furthermore, the definition of parameters for various components in the tables is similar to those of the first embodiment.<br>
Next, the optical function of the imaging optical system LB which is comprised of first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8 in the<br><br>
present embodiment, will be explained.<br>
In the present embodiment, the first and second imaging lenses 5 and 8 are made of resin (plastic).<br>
The imaging optical system LB functions to image the light beam scanningly deflected by the optical deflector 5 and forms a beam spot on the scan surface 11, to scan the scan surface 11 at a constant speed.<br>
An imaging lens made of resin can be produced by a known molding technique of filling a die with resin and removing it out of the die after cooling.<br>
In this way, the imaging lens can be produced more easily as compared with a conventional imaging lens based on a glass lens.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the first imaging lens 6 haring a sower —ainly in the main-scan direction has an aspherical surface shape having a lens form being expressed by the function of the equation given above.<br>
The first imaging lens 6 has a larger power in the main-scan direction than its power in the sub-scan direction.  Also, it is comprised of a lens (meniscus lens) having a non-arcuate shape in the main-scan section and having a concave surface facing toward the optical deflector 5 side.<br><br>
Furthermore, the shape of 'he first imaging lens 6 in the main-scan section is symmetric with respect to the optical axis.<br>
Furthermore, although with respect to the sub-scan direction the light entrance surface and the light exit surface have the same curvature and have no power, the iens may have a cylindrical shape, for example, having both surfaces being flat in the sub-scan direction.<br>
This lens provides an imaging function mainly in the main-scan direction, to the light beam incident thereon.<br>
On the other hand, the second imaging lens 8 is an anamorphic lens having a power mainly in the sub-scan direction, as shown in Table 2. The lens form is an aspherical surface shape expressed by a function of the equation given above.<br>
The second irriaging lens 8 has a larger power in the sub-scan direction than its power in the main-scan direction.  Also, the light entrance surface in the main-scan section has an arcuate shape, while the other surface has a non-arcuate shape.<br>
The shape in the main-scan section is symmetric with respect to the optical axis, and it has no power in the main-scan direction, on the<br><br>
axis .<br>
With regard to the shape in the sub-scan section, the light entrance surface is a flat surface having a very slow curvature, while the light exit surface has a convex shape in which the curvature changes gradually from the optical axis to the outside the optical axis, and the shape is symmetric with respect to the optical axis.<br>
For the light beam incident thereon, this lens has a function of imaging in the sub-scan direction and a function of slightly correcting the distortion in the main-scan direction.<br>
With regard to the imaging relationship in the sub-scan direction of the imaging optical system LB which is comprised of the first and second imaging lenses 6 and 8, it provides a what can be call-ed = S'rf = ce "cilt correcuion system in which the deflecting surface 51 and the scan surface 7 are in a conjugate relationship.<br>
It is to be noted that the imaging optical system LB should not always be a function expression as shown in the Table 2, but it may be a known expression.<br>
Furthermore, it may have an asymmetric shape with respect to the optical axis, for further improved imaging performance.<br><br>
In ":;his embodiment, as shown in FIG, 9, after the scan light beam 14 scanningly deflected by the deflecting surface 51 goes through the first imaging lens 6 and then the second imaging lens 8, it is reflected by the first reflecting mirror 7.<br>
Here, denoted in FIG. 9 at 81 is the central line of the contour of the holding frame (not shown) for the transmission type imaging optical element, and denoted at 82 is the optical axis of the imaging optical system LB.<br>
In this embodiment, within the sub-scan section, the second imaging lens 8 is so disposed that the contour central line 81 of the holding frame of the transmission type imaging optical element is located at a side of the principal ray of the light beam incidenr on the second imaging lens 8, which side is rexote from the reflected light path 15.<br>
Namely, in this embodiment, by shifting the second imaging lens 8 in a direction perpendicular to the scan light beam 14 only by a distance (shift amount) dZ, the interference between the reflected light path 15 and the second imaging lens 8 is avoided.<br>
Based on this avoidance of interference, the reflection angle G at the first reflecting<br><br>
mirror 7 can be made small, and zhis contributes to the reduction in height of the device in the sub-scan direction.<br>
It should be noted that, as shown in Table 2, the curvature radius r of the second imaging lens 8 in the sub-scan direction is 1000, and this lens is so designed that the optical axis 82 connecting the vertexes does not coincide with the contour central line 81.<br>
In the present embodiment, as shown in Table 2, the angle G defined between the normal to the first reflecting mirror 7 as a reflection type optical element and the principal ray of the scan light beam 14 is:<br>
6=7.1 degrees<br>
ri'is satisfies the conditional expression ;3,' as well as -he conditional expression (4).<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, the height H of the contour of the holding frame of the transmission type imaging optical element which holds the second imaging lens 8 and the distance dZ from the contour central line 81 to the principal ray of the incident light beam (scan light beam) 14 are: H = 12.0 and dZ = 1.7.  Thus,<br><br>
dZ/H = 0.142.<br>
This satisfies the conditional expression (5) as well as the conditional expression (6).<br>
In the present embodiment, as can be seen from FIG. S&gt;,   the height of the device in the sub-scan direction can be reduced by making the angle 6 small.   "   -<br>
Here, the second imaging lens 8 should be shifted in a direction perpendicular to the scan light beam 14 to avoid interference between the reflected light path 15 and the second imaging lens 8,<br>
Although the height reduction effect can be enhanced if the shift amount dZ is made larger, the largest possible shift amount is 1/2 of the lens height H, and this determines the upper limi" zf.   -he ccr_ci.~ior_al expression (5).<br>
F'-irthermore, in a resin lens which is molded by a die, if the lens height is made low as compared with the lens thickness in the optical axis direction, during the cooling process just after the lens is disengaged from the mold, cooling occurs and progresses from the upper and lower portions of the lens.<br>
As a result of this, a refractive index distribution and a birefringence distribution are<br><br>
easily created inside the lens, within the sub-scan section (lens height direction).<br>
It is known rhat this influence becomes more remarkable as the distance from the central axis of the lens contour becomes larger and that the imaging performance degrades steeply from around two-thirds (2/3) of the span from the contour center to the outer peripheral edge.<br>
Therefore, if the imaging performance of the device is a priority, the ratio should preferably satisfy d2/H 
The upper limit of the conditional expression (6) specifies this.<br>
The lower limit of the conditional expressions (5) and (6) defines the lower limit of the shift amount of the second imaging lens 8.<br>
If the shift amount is small, the effeci: of ir.~erference prevention of the interference beiiween the reflected light path 15 and the second imaging lens 8 become insufficient, and the interference would occur if the position of the reflected light path 15 or the position of the second imaging lens 8 varies because of the tolerance at the time of the assembly.<br>
In this embodiment, the second imaging lens 8 having a power in the sub-scan direction is so configured that the contour central line 81 and<br><br>
zhe optical axis 82 are mutually shifted by a physical distance dZ while the principal rev of the scan light beam 14 and the optical axis 82 coincide with each other.<br>
With this arrangement, the interference between the reflected light path 15 and the second imaging lens 8 is prevented while, on the other hand, by making the principal ray of the scan light beam 14 and the optical axis 82 coincident with each other, aberration deterioration and occurrence of scan line curve are suppressed.<br>
It should be noted that the concept of any one of the second to sixth embodiments may be incorporated into the second imaging lens 8 of the present embodiment.<br>
Furthermore, although the reflecting miirror as a reflection type optical element used in the firs~ ~z   sixth eiib-odimenrs is a plane mirror having no power, it m,ay be a curved surface mirror.<br>
A curved surface mirror which is a reflecting mirror may have a power either in the main-scan direction or in the sub-scan direction.<br>
[Embodiment of Image Forming Apparatus]<br>
Figure 10 is a schematic and sectional view, in the sub-scan direction, of a main oortinn<br><br>
of an image forming apparatus according zo   an embodiment of the present invention.  Denoted generally at 104 in the drawing is the image forming apparatus.<br>
The image forming apparatus 104 receives code data Dc supplied thereto from an external machine 117 such as a personal computer, for example.  The code data Dc is then transformed by a printer controller 111 inside the apparatus, into imagewise data (dot data] Di-<br>
The imagewise data Di is then inputted into an optical scanning unit (optical scanning device) 100 which is configured in accordance with any one of the preceding embodiments described hereinbefore.  The optical scanning unit 100 produces a light beam 103 having been modulated in accordance wirh the imagewise data Di, and with this lighr bea: 1C3, "he ohotosensitive surface of a photosensitive drum 101 is scanned in the miain-scan direction.<br>
The photosensitive drum 101 which is an electrostatic latent image bearing member (photosensitive member) is rotated clockwise by means of a motor 115.  Through this rotation, the photosensitive surface of the photosensitive drum 101 is moved relatively to the light beam 103, in the sub-scan direction which is orthogonal to the<br><br>
ma in-scan direction.<br>
Disposed just above the photosensitive drum 101 is a charging roller 102 which is in contact with the photosensitive drum surface to electrically charge the drum surface uniformly. Onto the photosensitive drum 101 surface having been electrically charged by the charging roller 102, the light beam 103 being scanned by the optical scanning unit 100 is projected.<br>
As described above, the light beam 103 has been modulated in accordance with the imagewise data Di.  By irradiating the photosensitive drum 101 with this light beam 103, an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum 101 surface.  The electrostatic latent image thus formed is then developed into a toner image, by means of a developing device 10' -*-r.ich is provided at a position downstream of ■che irradiation position of the light beam 103 with respect to the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 101 and which is in contact with the photosensitive drum 101.<br>
The toner image thus developed by the developing device 107 is transferred onto a transfer sheet (transfer material) 112 below the photosensitive drum 101, by means of a transfer roller 108 which is disposed opposed to the<br><br>
photosensitive drum iGl.<br>
Transfer sheets 112 are stored in a sheet cassette lOS in front of (at the right-hand side as viewed in Figure 10) the photosensitive drum, but these can be supplied manually.  There is a sheet supplying roller 110 at an end portion of the sheet cassette 109, for supplying each sheet 112 in the cassette 109 into a sheet supply path.<br>
The paper sheet 112 having an unfixed toner image transferred thereto in the manner described above is conveyed to a fixing device behind (at the left-hand side as viewed in Figure 10) the photosensitive drum 101.  The fixing device comprises a fixing roller 113 having a built-in fixing heater (not shown] and a pressing roller 114 disposed to be press-contacted to the fixing roller 113.  The transfer sheet 112 supplied from the iiTLage transfer station is heated under pressure at the press contact area between the fixing roller 113 and the pressing roller 114, whereby the unfixed toner image on the transfer sheet 112 is fixed thereon.<br>
Behind the fixing roller 113, there are sheet discharging rollers 116 which function to discharge the image-fixed sheet 112 out of the image forming apparatus.<br><br>
While not shown in Figure 10, the orint controller 111 has various functions in addition to the data conversion function described hereinbefore, such as for controlling a motor 115 or any other components inside the image forming apparatus as well as a polygon motor inside the optical scanning unit (to be described later).<br>
There is no particular limitation with regard to the recording density of the image forming apparatus to be used in the present invention.  However, since the higher the recording density is, the higher the required image quality is, the structures according to the first and second embodiments of the present invention will be more effective when they are introduced into an image forming apparatus of a resolution 1200 dpi or higher.<br>
[Embodiment of Color Image Forming Apparatus]<br>
Figure 11 is a schematic view of a main portion of a color image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.  This embodiment is directed to a tandem type color image forming apparatus in which four optical scanning devices are provided so as to record imagewise data upon the surfaces of corresponding photosensitive drums (image bearing<br><br>
members) in parallel toeac;ho~her.<br>
In Figure 11, denoted generally at 60 is a color image forming apparatus, and denoted at 61, 62, 53 and 54 are optical scanning devices having a structure according to any one of the preceding embodiments.  Denoted at 71, 72, 73 and 74 are photosensitive drums {image bearing members), and denoted at 31, 32, 33 and 34 are developing devices, respectively.  Denoted at 51 is a conveyance belt.<br>
Although not shown in FIG. 11, the image forming apparatus further comprises a transfer device for transferring the toner image developed by the developing device to a transfer material, and a fixing device for fixing the transferred toner image on the transfer sheet.<br>
In Figure 11, he color image forming apparatus 5C receives color signals of R (red), G (green) and 3 (blue) supplied thereto fromi an outside machine 52 such as a personal computer, for example.  These color signals are transformed by means of a printer controller 53 inside the image forming apparatus, into imagewise data (dot data) corresponding to C (cyan), M (magenta), Y (yellow) and B (black).<br>
These imagewise data are inputted into the optical scanning devices 61, 52, 53 and 54,<br><br>
respectively.  In response, zhese opnicai scanning devices produce light beams 41, 42, 43   and 44 having been modulated in accordance with the associated imagewise data.  Through these light beams, the photosensitive surfaces of the photosensitive drums 71, 72, 73 and 74 are scanned in the main-scan direction.<br>
In the color image forming apparatus of this embodiment, four optical scanning devices 51, 62, 63 and 64 are provided and these correspond to colors of C (cyan), M (magenta), Y {yellow) and B (black), respectively.  These scanning devices are operable in parallel to each other to record imagewise signals upon the surfaces of the photosensitive drums 71, 72, 73 and 74, respectively, so that a color image can be printed at high speed.<br>
As de5c:ribed, "he color image form.ing apparatus of this enbodi-e~"c uses four optical scanning devices 161, 62, 63 and 6i   to produce latent images for different colors upon the surfaces of corresponding photosensitive drums 71, 72, 73 and 74, respectively, by use of light beams based on respective image data.  After that, these images are superposedly transferred onto a recording sheet, whereby a single full-color image is produced thereon.<br><br>
As regards the outside machine 52, a color image reading machine having a CCD sensor, for example, may be used.  In that occasion, this color image reading machine and the color image forming apparatus 60 will provide a color digital copying machine.<br>
