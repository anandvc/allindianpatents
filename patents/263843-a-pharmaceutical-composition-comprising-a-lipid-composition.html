				<td>Coated lipid complexes and their use<br>
The present invention is related to cationic lipids, compositions containing the same and use thereof as well as a method for transferring chemical compounds into cells.<br>
Both molecular biology as well as molecular medicine heavily rely on the introduction of biologically active compounds into cells. Such biologically active compounds typically comprise, among others, DNA, RNA as well as peptides and proteins, respectively. The barrier which has to be overcome is typically a lipid bilayer which has a negatively charged outer surface. In the art, a number of technologies have been developed to penetrate the cellular membrane and to thus introduce the biologically active compounds. Some methods conceived for laboratory use, however, cannot be used in the medical field and are more particularly not suitable for drug delivery. For example, electroporation and ballistic methods known in the art, would, if at all, only allow a local delivery of biologically active compounds. Apart from said lipid bilayer cellular membranes also comprise transporter systems. Accordingly, efforts were undertaken to use this kind of transporter systmes in order to transfer the biologically active compounds across the cell membrane. However, due to the specificity or cross-reactivity of such transporter systems, their use is not a generally applicable method.<br>
A more generally applicable approach described in the art for transferring biologically active compounds into cells, is the use of viral vectors. However, viral vectors can be used only for transferring genes efficiently into some cell types; but they cannot be used to introduce chemically synthesised molecules into the cells.<br>
An alternative approach was the use of so called liposomes (Bangham, J. Mol. Biol. 13, 238-252). Liposomes are vesicles which are generated upon association of amphiphilic lipids in water. Liposomes typically comprise concentrically arranged bilayers of phospholipids. Depending on the number of layers liposomes can be categorised as small unilamelar vesicles, multilamelar vesicles and large multilamelar vesicles. Liposomes have proven to be effective delivery agents as they allow to incorporate hydrophilic compounds into the aqueous intermediate layers, whereas hydrophobic compounds are incorporated into the lipid layers. It is well known in the art that both the composition of the lipid formulation as well as its method of preparation have an effect on the structure and size of the resultant lipid aggregates and thus on the liposomes. Liposomes are also known to incorporate cationic lipids.<br>
Cationic lipids have, apart from being components of liposomes, also attracted considerable attention as they may as such be used for cellular delivery of biopolymers. Using cationic lipids any anionic compound can be encapsulated essentially in a quantitive manner due to electrostatic interaction. In addition, it is believed that the cationic lipids interact with the negatively charged cell membranes initiating cellular membrane transport. It has been found that the use of a liposomal formulation containing cationic lipids or<br>
the use of cationic lipids as such together with a biologically active compound requires a heuristic approach as each formulation is of limited use because it typically can deliver plasmids into some but not all cell types, usually in the absence of serum.<br>
Charge and/or mass ratios of lipids and the biologically active compounds to be transported by them have turned out to be a crucial factor in the delivery of different types of said biologically active compounds. For example, it has been shown that lipid formulations suitable for plasmid delivery comprising 5,000 to 10,000 bases in size, are generally not effective for the delivery of oligonucleotides such as synthetic ribozymes or antisense molecules typically comprising about 10 to about 50 bases. In addition, it has recently been indicated that optimal delivery conditions for antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes are different, even in the same cell type.<br>
US patent 6,395,713 discloses cationic lipid based compositions which typically consist of a lipophilic group, a linker and a head group and the use of such compositions for transferring biologically active compounds into a cell.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention was to provide a means for introducing biologically active compounds into cells, preferably animal cells. A further problem underlying the present invention is to provide a delivery agent for nucleic acids, particularly small nucleic acids such as siRNA, siNA and RNAi or aptamers and spiegelmers.<br>

The present inventors have surprisingly found that a very effective delivery in in vivo applications of nucleic acids, in particular small nucleic acids such as RNAi, siRNA and siNA, can be achieved by using a lipid composition comprising at least a first lipid component, at least a first helper lipid and an shielding compound. The shielding compound provides for a longer circulation time in vivo and thus allows for a better biodistribution of the nucleic acid containing lipid composition. By this mechanism, it is possible to target sites within a human or animal body which are comparatively remote from the site of administration of such lipid composition as the lipid composition is not immediately absorbed by the tissue surrounding<br>
the injection site, usually the endothelial lining of the vasculature when an intravenous administration performed. The shielding compound as used herein is preferably a compound which avoids the immediate interaction of the lipid composition with serum compounds or compounds of other bodily fluids or cytoplasma membranes, preferably cytoplasma membranes of the endothelial lining of the vasculature into which the lipid composition is preferably administered. The term shielding also means that elements of the immune system do not immediately interact with the lipid composition again increasing its circulation time in a living organism. Insofar, the shielding compound acts as an anti-opsinizing compound. Without whishing to be bound by any mechanism or theory, it seems that the shielding compound forms a cover or coat which reduces the surface area of the lipid composition available for interaction with its environment which would otherwise result in the lipid composition to fuse with other lipids or being bound by factors of the human and animal body, respectively, at a time which is too early for such interaction although it has to be acknowledged that at a later stage, i. e. after a prolonged time upon administration of the lipid composition, such interaction is usually preferred at least to a certain extent so as to provide the delivery. Another mechanism on which the observed efficacy of the shielding compound seems to be based is the shielding of the overall charge of the lipid composition and in particular of the lipid composition containing a nucleic acid, preferably a functional nucleic acid as defined herein and more preferably a siRNA, siNA and RNAi. Again, the interaction of the lipid composition seems to be affected, whereby the effect arises from the shielding of the charges rather than the shielding of the lipid components. In connection with the present disclosure, it is to be acknowledged that a composition can comprise as little as one lipid.<br>
The shielding compound is preferably a biologically inert compound. More preferably, the shielding compound does not carry any charge on its surface or on the molecule as such. Particularly preferred shielding compounds are thus polyethylenglycoles, hydroxyethylglucose based polymers, polyhydroxyethyl starch (polyHES) and polypropylene, whereby any of said compounds preferably has a molecule weight from about 500 to 10000 Da, more preferably from about 2000 to 5000 Da.<br>
It is an important feature of the present invention that the shielding compound is removable from the lipid composition under in vivo conditions. Such removal exposes the other components of the lipid composition or part thereof to the environment such as the animal and human body, and ultimately allows the release and delivery, respectively, of a compound such as a nucleic acid contained in the lipid composition. The term in vivo conditions preferably means the conditions existing in an animal or human body, preferably in any bodily fluid such as blood, interstitium and intracellular liquids, and/or those existing in an endosome and/or lysosome. Depending on the design of the shielding compound, the removal can be affected in various ways as will be described in more detail in the following.<br>
A further effect arising from the loss of the shielding agent, particularly if the shielding agent is PEG, is due to the fact that providing lipid formulations with PEG which is also referred to as PEGylation, often<br>
results in an impaired functional delivery of the nucleic acid molecules to be delivered by such lipid roimation into the cytoplasm. The bulky presence of the PEG at the lipid formulation impairs the endosomal uptake of the liposomes typically formed by the lipid formulation or interferes with the necessary endosomale escape of the nucleic acid contained or associated with the lipid composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the shielding compound is selected from the group comprising PEG, HEG, polyhydroxyethyl starch (polyHES) and polypropylene, which is attached, preferably covalently attached, to a ceramide. The ceramide interacts with the lipid compound and, if present, with a helper lipid. Insofar, the ceramide can be either the first helper lipid or a second helper lipid. It is preferred that the ceramide conjugated to PEG is different from the first helper lipid. The ceramide is embedded into the lipid fraction of the lipid composition preferably formed by the first lipid component and the first helper lipid and will be released due to the comparatively short hydrocarbon chain at a certain rate. When the ceramide is thus released from the lipid composition, so is the shielding agent. Therefore, in this embodiment, the in vitro conditions allow for the desintegration of the lipid formulation and thus provides a prolonged lifetime or circulation time in vivo of the lipid composition.<br>
In a further embodiment, the shielding agent is attached to a nucleic acid contained in the lipid composition or associated therewith. Preferably, the shielding agent is covalently linked to the nucleic acid, most preferably through a linker. In a more preferred embodiment, the linker is designed such that it is cleaved under physiological conditions, i. e. conditions prevailing in an animal or human organism. In a preferred embodiment only a certain percentage of the nucleic acid is actually provided with such polymer through a linker. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it seems that it is sufficient that only a certain number of nucleic acid molecules forming part of the lipid composition has to have such a bulky moiety so as to provide the shielding effect to said lipid composition. Preferably, the portion of nucleic acid molecules ranges from about 0 to 20 %, more preferably 3 to 10 %, and even more preferably from 6 to 10 %. Preferred contents of nucleic acids having the shielding agent (which is also referred to herein as the shielding compound) are from about 0 to 3 %, 3 to 6 %, 6 to 10 % and 10 to 20 %, whereby % as used in this paragraph and throughout the present application, if not indicated to the contrary, is mole %.<br>
Such linker can be a single-stranded RNA linker, more preferably comprising 1 to 20 nucleotides which will be cleaved by RNA endonuclease activity existing in or under in vivo conditions. In a further embodiment, the linker is formed by a single-stranded DNA linker which is cleaved by DNA endonucleases also present in or under in vivo conditions. In further embodiments, the linker can be formed by a double-stranded RNA or a double-stranded DNA The stability of the linker consisting of a nucleic acid is typically as follows: ssRNA
In a further embodiment, the linker can be formed by a oligopeptide, polypeptide or protein which is cleaved by proteases present in or under in vivo conditions. A still further embodiment provides a linker comprising an S-S-linkage which is sensitive to redox conditions.<br>
In an even still further embodiment the linker is a pH sensitive linker. The concept of a pH sensitive linker resides in the observation that upon internalisation of a lipid composition which can, in principle, be either a lipoplex or a liposome, any shielding agent which is clearly advantageous when it comes to the protection of the lipid composition prior to internalisation can impose a limitation of the further use of the compounds thus transferred into the cell. As used herein, the shielding agent is coupled to the pH sensitive linker which is or comprises in a preferred embodiment an anionic moiety. In an acidic environment such as an endosome, the charge of such anionic moiety is changed. Because of this, the interaction of the pH sensitive linker with the cationic lipid contained in the lipid formulation based on electrostatics is also changed, usually reduced which results in a more or less gradual release of the pH sensitive linker from the cationic lipid comprising lipid formulation. Consequently, the liposome becomes devoid of the shielding agent and can thus exert its impact in the cell. This kind of linker comprises both linkers which are as such known in the art and new linkers of this kind, i. e. having this kind of characteristics. Preferably, such linker is any linker which has a charge characteristic which allows the linker to react as described above. Representatives of such pH sensitive linkers comprise, but are not limited to, oligo(glutamic acid), oligophenolates, and diethylene triamine penta acetic acid. Both the coupling of such linker to the shielding agent and the incorporation of such linker into the shielding agent which is then commonly referred to as a moiety of the shielding agent is known to the ones skilled in the art.<br>
The compound used as the first lipid component in the lipid composition according to the present invention which is also referred to herein as the compound(s) according to the present invention can, as depicted in Fig. 1, can be regarded as to comprise a lipophilic group formed by the R1-N-R2 moiety, a linker group formed by the C(O)-CH(NH3+) (CH2)n-NH moiety and a head group formed by the R3 moiety. The present inventor has surprisingly found that this kind of compound exhibiting a positive charge at the linker group is particularly suitable to transfer biologically active compounds over a cell membrane and preferably into cells, more preferably animal cells. Also, the present inventor has surprisingly found that the transfer mediated by the compounds according to the present invention will be particularly effective if the biologically active compound is a nucleic acid, more preferably siRNA and siNA.<br>

Preferred straight chain alkyl groups contain from 8 to 30 carbon atoms. More preferred straight chain alkyl groups contain from 12 to<br>

It is to be understood that the compounds according to the present invention are preferably cationic lipids. More preferably, any of the NH or NH2 groups present in the compounds according to the present invention are present in a protonated form. Typically, any positive charge of the compound according to the present invention is compensated by the presence of an anion. Such anion can be a monovalent or polyvalent anion. Preferred anions are halides, acetate and trifluoroacetate. Halides as used herein are preferably fluorides, chlorides, iodides and bromides. Most preferred are chlorides. Upon association of the cationic lipid and the biologically active compound to be transferred into a cell, the halide anion is replaced by the biologically active compound which preferably exhibits one or several negative charges, although it has to be acknowledged that the overall charge of the biologically active compound is not necessarily negative.<br>
It is to be acknowledged that any compound according to formula (I) comprises at least two asymmetric C atoms. It is within the present invention that any possible enantiomer of such compound is disclosed herein, i. e. in particular the R-R; S-S; R-S and S-R enantiomer.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention can form a composition or be part of a composition, whereby such composition comprises a carrier. In such composition which is also referred to herein as lipid composition the compounds according to the present invention are also referred to as the lipid component(s). Such carrier is preferably a liquid carrier. Preferred liquid carriers are aqueous carriers and<br>
non-aqueous carriers. Preferred aqueous carriers are water, aqueous buffer systems, more preferably r systems having a physiological buffer strength and physiological salt concentration(s). Preferred non-aqueous carriers are solvents, preferably organic solvents such as ethanol, and tert.-butanol. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, any water miscible organic solvent can, in principle, be used. It is to be acknowledged that the composition, more particularly the lipid composition can thus be present as or form liposomes.<br>
The composition according to the present invention may comprise one or more helper lipids which are also referred to herein as helper lipid components. The helper lipid components are preferably selected from the group comprising phospholipids and steroids. Phospholipids are preferably di- and monoester of the phosphoric acid. Preferred members of the phospholipids are phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids. Steroids, as used herein, are naturally occurring and synthetic compounds based on the partially hydrogenated cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene. Preferably, the steroids contain 21 to 30 C atoms. A particularly preferred steroid is cholesterol.<br>
Particularly preferred helper lipids are l,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPhyPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE).<br>
Particularly preferred compositions according to the present invention comprise any of p-arginyl-2,3-diaminopropionic acid-N-palmityl-N-oleyl-amide trihydrochloride [#6], p-arginyl-2,3-diaminopropionic acid-N-lauryl-N-myristyl-amide trihydrochloride [#11] or e-arginyl-lysine-N-lauryl-N-myristyl-amide trihydrochloride [#15] in combination with DPhyPE, whereby the content of DPhyPE is from about 90 to 20 mol %, preferably 80 mol %, 65 mol %, 50 mol % and 35 mol %, whereby the term mol % refers to the percentage of the overall lipid content of the composition, i. e. the lipid content of the composition including the cationic lipid according to the present invention and any additional lipid, including, but not limited to, any helper lipid.<br>
It is within the present invention that the composition according to the present invention preferably comprises the compound according to the present invention and/or one or several of the helper lipid(s) as disclosed herein, whereby either the compound according to the present invention, i. e. the cationic lipid, and/or the helper lipid component is present as a dispersion in an aqueous medium. Alternatively, the compound according to the present invention, i. e. the cationic lipid, and/or the helper lipid component is/are present as a solution in a water miscible solvent. As an aqueous medium, preferably any of the aqueous carrier as disclosed herein is used. Preferred water miscible solvents are any solvent which form a homogenous phase with water in any ratio. Preferred solvents are ethanol and tert.-butanol. It is to be acknowledged that the composition, more particularly the lipid composition can thus be present as or form liposomes.<br>
It is to be acknowledged that the composition according to the present invention in its various emoodiments is and may thus also be used as a pharmaceutical composition. In the latter case, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a pharmaceutically active compound and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may, preferably, be selected from the group of carriers as defined herein in connection with the composition according to the present invention. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that any composition as described herein may, in principle, be also used as a pharmaceutical composition provided that its ingredients and any combination thereof is pharmaceutically acceptable. A pharmaceutical composition comprises a pharmaceutically active compound. Such pharmaceutically active compound can be the same as the further constituent of the composition according to the present invention which is preferably any biologically active compound, more preferably any biologically active compound as disclosed herein. The further constituent, pharmaceutically active compound and/or biologically active compound are preferably selected from the group comprising peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides and nucleic acids.<br>
Preferably, any such biologically active compound is a negatively charged molecule. The term negatively charged molecule means to include molecules that have at least one negatively charged group that can ion-pair with the positively charged group of the cationic lipid according to the present invention, although the present inventor does not wish to be bound by any theory. In principle, the positive charge at the linker moiety could also have some effect on the overall structure of either the lipid as such or any complex formed between the cationic lipid and the negatively charged molecule, i. e. the biologically active compound. Apart from that, the additional positive charge introduced into the lipid according to the present invention compared to the cationic lipids disclosed in US patent 6,395,713, should contribute to an increased toxicity of this lipid as taught by Xu Y, Szoka FC Jr.; Biochemistry; 1996 May 07, 35 (18): 5616-23. In contrast to what the one skilled in the art would have expected from this document of the prior art the compounds according to the present invention are particularly suitable for the various purposes disclosed herein and are in particular devoid of any increased toxicity.<br>
A peptide as preferably used herein is any polymer consisting of at least two amino acids which are covalently linked to each other, preferably through a peptide bond. More preferably, a peptide consists of two to ten amino acids. A particularly preferred embodiment of the peptide is an oligopeptide which even more preferably comprises from about 10 to about 100 amino acids. Proteins as preferably used herein are polymers consisting of a plurality of amino acids which are covalently linked to each other. Preferably such proteins comprise about at least 100 amino acids or amino acid residues.<br>
A preferred protein which may be used in connection with the cationic lipid and the composition according to the present invention, is any antibody, preferably any monoclonal antibody.<br>
Particularly preferred biologically active compounds, i. e. pharmaceutically active compounds and further constituent as used in connection with the composition according to the present invention are nucleic acids. Such nucleic acids can be either DNA, RNA, PNA or any mixture thereof. More preferably, the nucleic acid is a functional nucleic acid. A functional nucleic acid as preferably used herein is a nucleic acid which is not a nucleic acid coding for a peptide and protein, respectively. Preferred functional nucleic acids are siRNA, siNA, RNAi, antisense-nucleic acids, ribozymes, aptamers and spiegelmers which are all known in the art.<br>
siRNA are small interfering RNA as, for example, described in international patent application PCT/EP03/08666. These molecules typically consist of a double-stranded RNA structure which comprises between 15 to 25, preferably 18 to 23 nucleotide pairs which are base-pairing to each other, i. e. are essentially complementary to each other, typically mediated by Watson-Crick base-pairing. One strand of this double-stranded RNA molecule is essentially complementary to a target nucleic acid, preferably a mRNA, whereas the second strand of said double-stranded RNA molecule is essentially identical to a stretch of said target nucleic acid. The siRNA molecule may be flanked on each side and each stretch, respectively, by a number of additional oligonucleotides which, however, do not necessarily have to base-pair to each other.<br>
RNAi has essentially the same design as siRNA, however, the molecules are significantly longer compared to siRNA. RNAi molecules typically comprise 50 or more nucleotides and base pairs, respectively.<br>
A further class of functional nucleic acids which are active based on the same mode of action as siRNA and RNAi is siNA. siNA is, e. g., described in international patent application PCT/EP03/074654. More particularly, siNA corresponds to siRNA, whereby the siNA molecule does not comprise any ribonucleotides.<br>
Antisense nucleic acids, as preferably used herein, are oligonucleotides which hybridise based on base complementarity with a target RNA, preferably mRNA, thereby activating RNaseH. RNaseH is activated by both phosphodiester and phosphothioate-coupled DNA. Phosphodiester-coupled DNA, however, is rapidly degraded by cellular nucleases with exception of phosphothioate-coupled DNA. Antisense polynucleotides are thus effective only as DNA-RNA hybrid complexes. Preferred lengths of antisense nucleic acids range from 16 to 23 nucleotides. Examples for this kind of antisense oligonucleotides are described, among others, in US patent 5,849,902 and US patent 5,989,912.<br>
A further group of functional nucleic acids are ribozymes which are catalytically active nucleic acids preferably consisting of RNA which basically comprise two moieties. The first moiety shows a catalytic activity, whereas the second moiety is responsible for a specific interaction with the target nucleic acid. Upon interaction between the target nucleic acid and the said moiety of the ribozyme, typically by<br>
hybridisation and Watson-Crick base-pairing of essentially complementary stretches of bases on the hybridising strands, the catalytically active moiety may become active which means that it cleaves, either intramolecularly or intermolecularly, the target nucleic acid in case the catalytic activity of the ribozyme is a phosphodiesterase activity. Ribozymes, the use and design principles thereof are known to the ones skilled in the art and, for example, described in Doherty and Doudna (Annu. Ref. Biophys. Biomolstruct. 2000; 30: 457-75).<br>
A still further group of functional nucleic acids are aptamers. Aptamers are D-nucleic acids which are either single-stranded or double-stranded and which specifically interact with a target molecule. The manufacture or selection of aptamers is, e. g., described in European patent EP 0 533 838. In contrast to RNAi, siRNA, siNA, antisense-nucleotides and ribozymes, aptamers do not degrade any target mRNA but interact specifically with the secondary and tertiary structure of a target compound such as a protein. Upon interaction with the target, the target typically shows a change in its biological activity. The length of aptamers typically ranges from as little as 15 to as much as 80 nucleotides, and preferably ranges from about 20 to about 50 nucleotides.<br>
Another group of functional nucleic acids are spiegelmers as, for example, described in international patent application WO 98/08856. Spiegelmers are molecules similar to aptamers. However, spiegelmers consist either completely or mostly of L-nucleotides rather than D-nucleotides in contrast to aptamers. Otherwise, particularly with regard to possible lengths of spiegelmers, the same applies to spiegelmers as outlined in connection with aptamers.<br>
As mentioned previously, the present inventor has surprisingly found that the compound according to the present invention and the respective compositions comprising such compound can be particularly effective in transferring RNAi, and more particularly siRNA and siNA into a cell. It is to be noted that although not wishing to be bound by any theory, due to the particular mol percentages of the helper lipid(s) contained in the lipid compositions according to the present invention, which helper lipid can be either a PEG-free helper lipid or in particular a PEG-containing helper lipid, surprising effects can be realised, more particularly if the content of any of this kind of helper lipid is contained within the concentration range specified herein, hi connection therewith, it is particularly noteworthy that if the composition according to the present invention contains a helper lipid comprising a PEG moiety, any delivery or transfection action using such PEG-derived helper lipid containing composition is particularly effective in delivering nucleic acid, particularly RNAi molecules, most particularly siRNA, siNA, antisense nucleotides and ribozymes.<br>
The reason for this is that the present inventors have surprisingly found that liposomes containing more than about 4% of PEG-containing helper lipid(s) are not active, whereas liposomes with less than 4% (preferably less than 3% but more than 0 %) do mediate functional delivery. Basically, the present<br>
inventors have discovered that the specific amount of PEG in the lipid compositions according to the invention is suitable to provide for an effective transfection and delivery, respectively.<br>
In a further aspect the present inventors have surprisingly found that the lipid compositions according to the present invention which are preferably present as lipoplexes or liposomes, preferably show an overall cationic charge and thus an excess of at least one positive charge. More preferably, the lipid compositions exhibit a charge ratio negative : positive of from about 1: 1.3 to 1:5. Therefore, the present invention is thus related in a further aspect to any lipid composition comprising at least one cationic lipid and a nucleic acid, preferably a RNAi, siRNA or siNA or any other of the functional nucleic acids defined herein, having a charge ratio negative : positive of from about 1: 1.3 to 1:5. The cationic lipid is preferably any cationic lipid described herein. The lipid composition comprises in a preferred embodiment any helper lipid or helper lipid combination as described herein.<br>
The present inventors have also found that in particular the molar ratio of siRNA and the cationic lipid can be crucial for the successful application of the lipid composition according to the present invention, especially in view of what has been said above in relation to the cationic overall charge of the nucleic acid containing lipid formulations. Without wishing to be bound by any theory it seems that 1 mole of cationic lipid, particularly as disclosed herein, can provide for a maximum of three positive charges per molecule, whereas the nucleic acid and more particularly the siRNA molecules as disclosed herein, provide for a maximum of 40 negative charges per molecule. In order to reach an overall positive charge of the siRNA containing lipid formulations according to the present invention, the molar ratio can range from 0 to a maximum of 0.075. A preferred molar ration range is from about 0.02 to 0.05 and even more preferred is a molar ratio range of about 0.037.<br>
It is within the present invention that the composition and more particularly the pharmaceutical composition may comprise one or more of the aforementioned biologically active compounds which may be contained in a composition according to the present invention as pharmaceutically active compound and as further constituent, respectively. It will be acknowledged by the ones skilled in the art that any of these compounds can, in principle, be used as a pharmaceutically active compound. Such pharmaceutically active compound is typically directed against a target molecule which is involved in the pathomechanism of a disease. Due to the general design principle and mode of action underlying the various biologically active compounds and thus the pharmaceutically active compounds as used in connection with any aspect of the present invention, virtually any target can be addressed. Accordingly, the compound according to the present invention and the respective compositions containing the same can be used for the treatment or prevention of any disease or diseased condition which can be addressed, prevented and/or treated using this kind of biologically active compounds. It is to be acknowledged that apart from these biologically active compounds also any other biologically active compound can be part of a composition according to any embodiment of the present invention. Preferably such other biologically active compound comprises at<br><br>

The composition, particularly the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be used for various forms of administration, whereby local administration and systemic administration are particularly preferred. Even more preferred is a route of administration which is selected from the group comprising intramascular, percutaneous, subcutaneous, intravenous and pulmonary administration. As preferably used herein, local administration means that the respective composition is administered in close spatial relationship to the cell, tissue and organ, respectively, to which the composition and the biologically active compound, respectively, is to be administered. As used herein, systemic administration means an administration which is different from a local administration and more preferably is the administration into a body fluid such as blood and liquor, respectively, whereby the body liquid transports the composition to the cell, tissue and organ, respectively, to which the composition and the biologically active compound, respectively, is to be delivered.<br>
As used herein, the cell across the cell membrane of which a biologically active compound is to be transferred by means of the compound and composition according to the present invention, respectively, is preferably an eukaryotic cell, more preferably a vertebrate cell and even more preferably a mammalian cell. Most preferably the cell is a human cell.<br>
Any medicament which can be manufactured using the compound and composition according to the present invention, respectively, is for the treatment and prevention of a patient. Preferably such patient is a vertebrate, more preferably a mammal and even more preferably such mammal is selected from the group comprising mice, rats, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, sheep, pigs, goats, cows, horses, poultry monkeys and humans. In a further aspect the compound and composition according to the present invention can be used as a transferring agent, more preferably as a transfection agent.<br>
used herein a transferring agent is any agent which is suitable to transfer a compound, more preferably a biologically active compound such as a pharmaceutically active compound across a membrane, preferably a cell membrane and more preferably transfer such compound into a cell as previously described herein. Even more preferably, such transfer also comprises the release from any endosome/liposome.<br>
In a still further aspect the present invention is related to a method for transferring, more particularly transfecting, a cell with a biologically active compound. In a first step, whereby the sequence of steps is not necessarily limited and in particular not limited to the sequence of steps outlined in the following, the cell and the membrane and cell, respectively, is provided. In a second step, a compound according to the present invention is provided as well as a biologically active compound such as a pharmaceutically active compound. This reaction can be contacted with the cell and the membrane, respectively, and due to the biophysical characteristics of the compound and the composition according to the present invention, the biologically active compound will be transferred from one side of the membrane to the other one, or in case the membrane forms a cell, from outside the cell to within the cell. It is within the present invention that prior to contacting the cell and the membrane, respectively, the biologically active compound and the compound according to the present invention, i. e. the cationic lipid, are contacted, whereupon preferably a complex is formed and such complex is contacted with the cell and the membrane, respectively.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention the method for transferring a biologically active compound and a pharmaceutically active compound, respectively, comprises the steps of providing the cell and the membrane, respectively, providing a composition according to the present invention and contacting both the composition and the cell and the membrane, respectively. It is within the present invention that the composition may be formed prior or during the contacting with the cell and the membrane, respectively.<br>
In an embodiment of any method for transferring a biologically active compound as disclosed herein, the method may comprise further steps, preferably the step of detecting whether the biologically active compound has been transferred. Such detection reaction strongly depends on the kind of biologically active compounds transferred according to the method and will be readily obvious for the ones skilled in the art. It is within the present invention that such method is performed on any cell, tissue, organ and organism as described herein.<br>
It is to be acknowledged that in a further embodiment the shielding agent is attached, as described herein, to the lipid component of the lipid composition according to the present invention, preferably to the cationic lipid.<br>

Example 1:     Synthesis of N-oleyl-palmityl amine according to the prior art<br>
N-oleyl-palmityl amine is an important starting material for the compounds according to the present invention. The N-oleyl-palmityl amine can, in principle, be synthesised as described in US 6,395,713. The respective reaction scheme is depicted in Fig. 2. However, the starting material is oleyl amine of technical grade as provided by, e. g., Fluka. An analysis of this starting material by gas chromatography shows a purity of &gt; 70 %, whereby 30 % of the material consist of amine having different chain lengths. The reason for this could be that the material as such is obtained from plant sources. Combining both oleyl amine and 1 -bromohexadecane (palmitylbromid) yields N-oleyl-palmityl amine after reacting both starting materials at 100 to 120° C for 30 minutes. The yield is about 83 %.<br>
Example 2:     Synthesis of N-palmityl-oleyl amine according to the present invention<br>
A new synthesis has been perceived by the present inventor in connection with the compounds according to the present invention (Fig. 3). This new reaction scheme is based on the finding of the present inventor<br>
that the high amount of impurities is affecting the quality of the transferring agent prepared based on this<br>
starting material. Accordingly, the reaction starts using oleic acid having a purity of &gt; 99 % as shown by gas chromatography and contacting such oleic acid with ethylchloroformate, TEA and CH2Cl2 and reacting the thus obtained mixed carboxylic-carbonic anhydride with hexadecylamine (palmitylamine) having again a purity of &gt; 99 % as shown by gas chromatography. The reaction product N-palmityl-oleoyl amide [#1] is subsequently reacted with LiAlH4 (in THF) resulting in 85 % N-palmityl-oleyl amine [#2] which is present as a colourless crystalline solid.<br>
The more detailed reaction conditions are outlined in the following. Synthesis of N-palmityl-oleoyl amide [#1]<br>

The volatile components were removed by a rotary evaporator and the residue is chromatography purified using 40 g silica gel 60 (Merck) using hexane/ethylacetate 5:1. The product was eluted using a step gradient consisting of ethylacetate, ethylacetate/methanol 4:1 and dichloromethane/methanol 4:1. 576 mg (0.85 mmol) Boc-Dap-N-palmityl-N-oleyl-amide were obtained as a yellow viscous oil.<br>

The mixture was steered under argon atmosphere at room temperature for 20 hours. Subsequently, the dichloromethane is removed by a rotary evaporator and the residue in 100 ml MtBE transferred into a separating funnel. The organic phase was thoroughly washed with 0.1 N HC1, 1 N NaOH and saturated NaHCO3 solution, dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent removed by a rotary evaporator.

The mixture was steered under argon inert gas at room temperature for 24 hours, whereby product precipitated as amorphous and partially as wax-like solid from the solution after about 6 to 8 hours. After completion of the reaction (thin layer control using CHCI3/MeOH/NH4OH 65:25:4) any volatile components were removed under high vacuum. 489 mg (0.58 mmol) p"-arginyl-2,3-<br>

18.54 g (100 mmol) dodecylamine (laurylamine), 6.36 g (60 mmol) Na2CO3 and 50 mg tetrabutyl ammonium iodide (TBAI) were suspended in 100 ml anhydrous DMF in a 500 ml 3-neck flask having a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. A solution of 16.4 ml (60 mmol) I-bromo tetradecane in 100 ml anhydrous dioxane were added dropwise at 100° C over a period of 110 minutes and the mixture was steered for another 3.5 hours at 100° C (Fig. 6). The solution was filtered at a temperature as hot as possible. The crystalline solid which precipitated at 4° C over night, was removed and was washed with a little of cold methanol. Subsequently, the solid was re-crystallised from 200 ml methanol. 9 g of colourless leaf-like crystals were obtained which are re-crystallised from 100 ml MtBE. The crystals which precipitated at -18° C, were sucked off from a cooled frit and washed with cold MtBE. 7.94 g (21 mmol) of a colourless crystalline solid were obtained, corresponding to a yield of 35 %.<br>

Example 18;   Manufacture of complexes consisting of cationic liposomes and siRNA (Lipoplexes)<br>
Lipoplexes consisting of cationic liposomes and siRNA were manufactured using standard Technologies known in the art such as lipid film/cake, ethanole injection procedure, reversed phase evaporation and detergent dialysis procedure [c.f. Liposomes as Tools in Basic Research and Industry; Jean R. Philippot and Francis Schuber; CRC Press January 1995 und Liposome Technology: Preparation of Liposomes:001 Gregory Gregoriadis CRC Press I Lie. April 1984.<br>
The thus obtained liposomes which are also referred to herein as lipoplexes comprise as the lipid beta-arginyl-2,3-diarninopropionic acid-N-palmityl-N-oleyl-amide trihydrochloride and additionally either 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, whereby the use of l,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine is preferred. The lipid fraction of such liposomes and lipoplexes, respectively, was 50 mol% beta-arginyl-2,3-diaminopropionic acid-N-palmityl-N-oleyl-amide trihydrochloride and either 50 mol% l,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or 50 mol% l,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.<br>
The combination of 50 mol% β-arginyl-2,3-diaminopropionic acid-N-palmityl-N-oleyl-amide trihydrochloride and 50 mol% l,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine is also referred to herein as atuFect.<br>
It is to be understood that in principle any other lipid and lipid composition as disclosed herein can be manufactured using the previously mentioned techniques as well as the further processing steps.<br>
The liposomes and lipoplexes, respectively, are subjected to further processing steps so as to trim them with regard to size, polydispersibility and layer design. These characteristics can be adjusted by sonication, extrusion such as through porous membranes, and homogenisation, preferably high pressure homogenisation.<br>
The thus formed liposomes were characterised by photon correlation spectroscopy with Beckman-Coulter N 5 submicron particle analyser and the results of such liposomes either sized by extrusion or by high-pressure homogenisation are depicted in Fig. 12A and 12B, respectively.<br>
From Fig. 12A it can be taken that the size distribution of the liposomes can be modified using different membranes having different size exclusions, in the present case 1,000 nm and 400 run, respectively. In both cases, the extrusion step was repeated 21 times. It is, however, within the present invention that the size exclusion can be from about 50 to 5000 nm, and that the extrusion steps can be repeated 10 to 50 times.<br>
As may be taken from Fig. 12B high-pressure homogenisation is also a suitable means to modify the size distribution of the liposomes, whereby upon applying such high-pressure homogenisation the size of the<br>
liposomes depends on the number of homogenisation cycles to which the liposomes were subjected. Typical pressure ranges are from 100-2500 bar, whereby in the present case the applied pressure was 1,500 bar.<br>
Example 19:   Lipid composition and PEG content<br>
In order to test the impact of PEG on the efficacy of transfection and delivery of lipid compositions comprising p-arginyl-2,3-diaminopropionic acid-N-palmityl-N-oleyl-amide trihydrochloride (cationic lipid) as the first lipid component, l,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPhyPE) as the first helper lipid and ceramide conjugated to PEG2000 (C8mPEG2000) and PEG5000 (C8mPEG5000), respectively, the following formulations were generated in accordance with the methods disclosed herein:<br>
A1 - A5 formulations:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
B1-B5 formulations:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
For any of the aforementioned formulations the lipid concentration was 1.445 mg/ml, siRNA concentration was 15 µM in 300 mM sucrose. Dilution of the concentrated stock-complexes formed yielded an end concentration of 20, 10, 5 nM siRNA in the cell culture medium.<br>
The RNAi molecules contained in said formulations were directed against PTEN and the sequences were as follows: First strand having the following sequence: uaaguucuagcuguggugg-P; second strand having the sequence ccaccacagcuagaacuua-P, whereby the modification pattern is such that the nucleotides which are printed in bold and, are 2'-O-methyl nucleotides; at any of the strands, the 3' end starts with a phosphate depicted by P in the aforementioned sequences.<br>
The lipid formulations were administered to HeLa cells contained in a 6 well plate each containing 40,000 cells/well. The cells were analysed for expression of PTEN and the results depicted in Fig. 13 as Western Blots, p110a expression was used as loading control and detected by an antibody. From any of the Western Blots depicted in Fig. 13 A and 13B it can be taken that the content of the PEG compound, i. e. the shielding compound can be increased up to 5 and 7.5 mol%, whereby the concentration can be higher or be at the higher end of this range in case of PEG2000 compared to PEG5000 used.<br>
This is a clear advantage compared to those PEG containing compositions where the PEG is not removable from the lipid composition. Lipid formulations of similar compositions comprising 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-polyethylen-glycole (DSPE-PEG2000) in the range from 1 to 5 mol% rather than the ceramide PEG conjugate allow only the introduction of 1 to 2 mol% so as to provide for an efficient knockdown.<br>
