GROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br><br>
[0001] The present application claims priority to Application No. 11/285,397 entitled "Double Data Rate Serial Encoder" filed November 23, 2005, which claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/630,853 entitled "MDDI Host Core Design" filed November 24, 2004, Provisional Application No. 60/631,549 entitled "Mobile Display Digital Interface Host Camera Interface Device" filed November 30, 2004, Provisional Application No. 60/632,825 entitled "Camera MDDI Host Device" filed December 2, 2004, Provisional Application No. 60/633,071 entitled "MDDI Overview" filed December 2, 2004, Provisional Application No. 60/633,084 entitled "MDDI Host Core Pad Design" filed December 2, 2004, and Provisional Application No. 60/632,852 entitled "Implementation of the MDDI Host Controller" filed December 2, 2004, which are assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br><br>
[0002] The present application is also related to commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.<br><br>
6,760,772 B2, titled "Generating and Implementing a Communication Protocol and Interface for High Speed Data Transfer", issued July 6, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
Field <br><br>
[0003] The present invention relates generally to a serial encoder for high data rate serial communication links. More particularly, the invention relates to a double data rate serial encoder for Mobile Display Digital Interface (MDDI) links.<br><br>
Background<br><br>
[0004] In the field of interconnect technologies, demand for ever increasing data rates, especially as related to video presentations, continues to grow.<br><br>
[0005] The Mobile Display Digital Interface (MDDI) is a cost-effective, low power consumption, transfer mechanism that enables very-high-speed data transfer over a short-range communication link between a host and a client. MDDI requires a minimum of just four -wires plus power for bi-directional data transfer that delivers a maximum bandwidth of up to 3.2 Gbits per second.<br><br>
[0006] In one application, MDDI increases reliability and decreases power consumption in clamshell phones by significantly reducing the number of wires that run across a handset's hinge to interconnect the digital baseband controller with an LCD display and/or a camera. This reduction of wires also allows handset manufacturers to lower development costs by simplifying clamshell or sliding handset designs.<br><br>
[0007] MDDI is a serial transfer protocol, and, as such, data received in parallel for transmission over an MDDI link needs to be serialized. U.S. Patent Application No. 11/285,397, entitled "Double Data Rate Serial Encoder", filed November 23, 2005 describes an MDDI Double Data Rate (DDR) serial encoder having a glitchless output. The glitchless output serial encoder benefits from a glitchless multiplexer, designed with a priori knowledge of a Gray code input select sequence. This a priori knowledge of the input select sequence allows for a reduction in the size of the multiplexer and, subsequently, of that of the DDR serial encoder.<br><br>
[0008] However, improvements can be made in several aspects to the DDR serial encoder design described in U.S. Application No. 11/285,397. In one aspect, it is <br><br>
noted that the glitchless multiplexer used in the DDR serial encoder described in U.S. Application No. 11/285,397 remains larger in size than a non-glitchless multiplexer. In another aspect, the number of logic layers between the final register stage and the encoder output, a factor that contributes to larger output skew and lower link rate, can be significantly reduced.<br><br>
[0009] What is needed therefore is an MDDI DDR serial encoder having reduced size, complexity, and output skew. What is also needed is that the MDDI DDR serial encoder has a glitchless output.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0010] A Double Data Rate (DDR) serial encoder is provided herein.<br><br>
[0011] In one aspect, the DDR serial encoder includes a non-glitchless multiplexer and digital logic for ensuring a glitch-free encoder output. By using a non-glitchless multiplexer, the size and complexity of the encoder is significantly reduced.<br><br>
[0012] In another aspect, the DDR serial encoder has a single layer of logic between the final register stage and the encoder output and a reduced number of paths from the final register stage to the encoder output, thereby resulting in reduced output skew and increased link rate. The reduced number of paths from the final register stage to the encoder output also simplifies output skew analysis.<br><br>

Mobile Display Digital Interface (MDDI)<br><br>
[0028] The Mobile Display Digital Interface (MDDI) is a cost-effective, low power consumption, transfer mechanism that enables very-high-speed serial data transfer over a short-range communication link between a host and a client.<br><br>
[0029] In the following, examples of MDDI will be presented with respect to a camera module contained in an upper clamshell of a mobile phone. However, it would be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) that any module having functionally equivalent features to the camera module could be readily substituted and used in various embodiments of this invention.<br><br>
[0030] Further, according to embodiments of the invention, an MDDI host may comprise one of several types of devices that can benefit from using the present invention. For example, the host could be a portable computer in the form of a handheld, laptop, or similar mobile computing device. It could also be a Personal Data Assistant (PDA), a paging device, or one of many wireless telephones or modems. Alternatively, the host could be a portable entertainment or presentation device such as a portable DVD or CD player, or a game playing device. Furthermore, the host can reside as a host device or control element in a variety of other widely used or planned commercial products for which a high speed communication link with a client is desired. For example, a host could be used to transfer data at high rates from a video recording device to a storage based client for improved response, or to a high resolution larger screen for presentations. An appliance such as a refrigerator that incorporates an onboard inventory or computing system and/or Bluetooth connections to other household devices, can have improved display capabilities when operating in an internet or Bluetooth connected mode, or have reduced wiring needs for in-the-door displays (a client) <br><br>
and keypads or scanners (client) while the electronic computer or control systems (host) reside elsewhere in the cabinet. In general, those skilled in the art will appreciate the wide variety of modern electronic devices and appliances that may benefit from the use of this interface, as well as the ability to retrofit older devices ¦with higher data rate transport of information utilizing limited numbers of conductors available in either newly added or existing connectors or cables. At the same time, an MDDI client may comprise a variety of devices useful for presenting information to an end user, or presenting information from a user to the host. For example, a micro-display incorporated in goggles or glasses, a projection device built into a hat or helmet, a small screen or even holographic element built into a vehicle, such as in a window or windshield, or various speaker, headphone, or sound systems for presenting high quality sound or music. Other presentation devices include projectors or projection devices used to present information for meetings, or for movies and television images. Other examples include the use of touch pads or sensitive devices, voice recognition input devices, security scanners, and so forth that may be called upon to transfer a significant amount of information from a device or system user with little actual "input" other than touch or sound from the user. In addition, docking stations for computers and car kits or desk-top kits and holders for wireless telephones may act as interface devices to end users or to other devices and equipment, and employ either clients (output or input devices such as mice) or hosts to assist in the transfer of data, especially where high speed networks are involved. However, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the present invention is not limited to these devices, there being many other devices on the market, and proposed for use, that are intended to provide end users with high quality images and sound, either in terms of storage and transport or in terms of presentation at playback. The present invention is useful in increasing the data throughput between various elements or devices to accommodate the high data rates needed for realizing the desired user experience. <br><br>
[0031] FIG. 1 is a block diagram that illustrates an example environment using an<br><br>
MDDI interface. In the example of FIG. 1, MDDI is used to interconnect modules across the hinge of a clamshell phone 100. It must be noted here that while certain embodiments of the present invention will be described in the context of specific examples, such as MDDI interconnections in a clamshell phone, this is done for illustration purposes only and should not be used to limit the present invention to such embodiments. As will be understood by a person skilled in the relevant art(s) based on the teachings herein, embodiments of the present invention may be used in other devices including any that may benefit from having MDDI interconnections.<br><br>
[0032] Referring to FIG. 1, a lower clamshell section 102 of clamshell phone 100 includes a Mobile Station Modem (MSM) baseband chip 104. MSM 104 is a digital baseband controller. An upper clamshell section 114 of clamshell phone 100 includes a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) module 116 and a camera module 118.<br><br>
[0033] Still referring to FIG. 1, an MDDI link 110 connects camera module 118 to<br><br>
MSM 104. Typically, an MDDI link controller is integrated into each of camera module 118 and MSM 104. In the example of FIG. 1, an MDDI Host 122 is integrated into camera module 112, while an MDDI Client 106 resides on the MSM side of the MDDI link 110. Typically, the MDDI host is the master controller of the MDDI link. In the example of FIG. 1, pixel data from camera module 118 are received and formatted into MDDI packets by MDDI Host 122 before being transmitted onto MDDI link 110. MDDI client 106 receives the MDDI packets and re-converts them into pixel data of the same format as generated by camera module 118. The pixel data are then sent to an appropriate block in MSM 104 for processing.<br><br>
[0034] Still referring to FIG. 1, an MDDI link 112 connects LCD module 116 to<br><br>
MSM 104. In the example of FIG. 1, MDDI link 112 interconnects an MDDI Host 108, integrated into MSM 104, and an MDDI Client 120 integrated into LCD module 116. In the example of FIG. 1, display data generated by a graphics controller of MSM 104 are received and formatted into MDDI packets by MDDI Host 108 before <br><br>
being transmitted onto MDDI link 112. MDDI client 120 receives the MDDI packets and re-converts them into display data for use by LCD module 116.<br><br>
[0035] FIG. 2 is a block diagram that illustrates MDDI link interconnection 110 according to the example of FIG. 1. As described above, one of the functions of MDDI link 110 is to transfer pixel data from camera module 118 to MSM 104. Accordingly, in the embodiment of FIG. 2, a frame interface 206 connects camera module 118 to MDDI Host 122. The frame interface 206 serves to transfer pixel data from camera module 118 to MDDI Host 122.<br><br>
[0036] Typically, camera module 118 receives pixel data from a camera through a parallel interface, stores the pixel data, and then transfers it to MDDI Host 122 when the host is ready. MDDI Host 122 encapsulates the received pixel data into MDDI packets. However, in order for MDDI Host 122 to be able to transmit the pixel data onto MDDI link 110, a serialization of the MDDI packets is necessary.<br><br>
[0037] In the embodiment of FIG. 2, a serializer module 202, integrated within<br><br>
MDDI Host 122, serves to serially shift out the MDDI packets onto MDDI link 110. At the MSM end of MDDI link 110, a de-serializer module 204, integrated within MDDI client 106, re-constructs the MDDI packets from the serial data received over MDDI link 110. MDDI client 106 then removes the MDDI encapsulation and transfers the parallel pixel data through a frame interface 208 to an appropriate block of MSM 104.<br><br>
MDDI Serial Encoder<br><br>
[0038] FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram that illustrates an MDDI serial encoder 300.<br><br>
MDDI serial encoder 300 is described in more detail in U.S. Application No. 11/285,397, entitled "Double Data Rate Serial Encoder", filed November 23, 2005. Serial encoder 300 includes a final data register stage, illustrated using flip-flops 320 and 322, a select input register stage, illustrated using flip-flops 314, 316, and 318, and a glitchless multiplexer circuitry 324. <br><br>
[0039] The final data register stage flip-flops 320 and 322 receive data input signals<br><br>
308 and 310, respectively. In one embodiment, data input signals 308 and 310 are each 4 bits. Accordingly, flip-flops 320 and 322 are each 4-bit flip-flops. In other embodiments, flip-flops 320 and 322 may be replaced with four 2-bit flip-flops or eight 1-bit flip-flops. As illustrated in FIG. 3, flip-flops 320 and 322 are D flip-flops, but other types of flip-flops or registers may also be used as understood by a person skilled in the art based on the teachings herein. Flip-flops 320 and 322 are controlled by a clock signal 312 and update their outputs at every rising edge of clock signal 312.<br><br>
[0040] The select input register stage flip-flops 314, 316, and 318 receive select input signals sel(2) 302, sel(l) 304, and sel(0) 306, respectively. Select input signals 302, 304, and 306 are typically provided by a counter and are used to select the input of multiplexer circuitry 324. In one embodiment, select signals 302, 304, and 306 are generated according to a Gray code sequence, which is known a priori by multiplexer circuitry 324, thereby allowing a glitchless multiplexer output. Flip- flops 314, 316, and 318 are D flip-flops, but other types of flip-flops may also be used as understood by a person skilled in the art based on the teachings herein. Flip-flops 314, 316, and 318 are also controlled by clock signal 312, with flip-flop 318 updating its output at rising edges of clock signal 312 and flip-flops 314 and 316 updating their outputs at falling edges of clock signal 312.<br><br>
[0041] Multiplexer circuitry 324 receives data input signals from the final data register stage and input select signals from the select input register stage, and generates the output 334 of serial encoder 300. Multiplexer circuitry 324 generates a glitchless encoder output using a priori knowledge of the Gray code input select sequence. Multiplexer circuitry 324 includes four layers of logic 326, 328, 330, and 332 that separate the final data register stage (flip-flops 320 and 322) and the select input register stage (flip-flops 318, 320, and 322) from the encoder output 334. Logic layer 326 includes inverter circuitry on certain paths from the select input register stage to the encoder output. Logic layer 326 is coupled via an interconnect to logic <br><br>
layer 328, "which includes a plurality of AND gates. In turn, logic layer 328 is coupled via an interconnect to logic layer 330. Logic layer 330 includes a plurality of OR gates, which provide the inputs of logic layer 332. Logic layer 332 includes an OR gate that provides the output 334 of the serial encoder.<br><br>
[0042] It is noted that the four logic layers 326, 328, 330, and 332 of multiplexer circuitry 324 are based on combinatorial logic and are not driven by clock signals. Accordingly, signal propagation delays on different paths from the final data register stage and/or the select input register stage to the encoder output may be different. Further, signal propagation delays could vary according to temperature and/or process variations in the encoder circuitry, making them difficult to monitor and/or to compensate for.<br><br>
[0043] Typically, having different signal propagation delays on paths to the encoder output results in what is known as "output skew", with the actual encoder output being skewed or distorted relative to a desired nominal output. Output skew may also result from the skewing of a single signal that contributes to the encoder output.<br><br>
[0044] FIGs. 4A-B illustrate examples of signal skew. FIG. 4A illustrates skew in an example signal 400, whereby falling and/or rising edges may occur earlier or later than when they should ideally occur. FIG. 4B illustrates skew between two signals Output 1 and Output 2. Output 1 and Output 2 result from synchronized input signals 402 and 402 propagating through paths 406 and 408 respectively of exemplary circuit 414, with paths 406 and 408 having different signal propagation delays. The skew between signals Output 1 and Output 2, illustrated as "W in FIG. 4B, represents the time difference magnitude between signals Output 1 and Output 2, which ideally would occur simultaneously. Note that the skew between signals Output 1 and Output 2 could result in an output skew at output 412 of exemplary circuit 414.<br><br>
[0045] In certain cases, output skew may cause a reduction in the maximum MDDI link rate. It is evident therefore that output skew should be minimized. <br><br>
Low Output Skew MDDI Serial Encoder<br><br>
[0046] According to the present invention, output skew is reduced by minimizing the effects of factors that contribute thereto. In one aspect, output skew is affected by the individual skew of each signal (from the final data register stage and/or the select input register stage) that contributes to the encoder output. In another aspect, output skew is proportional to the magnitudes of these individual signal skews, which, in turn, are proportional to the lengths of their respective signal paths (a function of the number of successive logic layers to reach the encoder output).<br><br>
[0047] As such, output skew can be reduced by minimizing: (1) the number of signals (from the final data register stage and/or select input register stage) that contribute to the encoder output, and (2) the number of logic layers from the final data register stage and/or the select input register stage to the encoder output.<br><br>
[0048] FIG. 5 is a block diagram that illustrates an MDDI serial encoder 500 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Serial encoder 500 includes a non-glitchless multiplexer 506 and a synchronizing circuit 510.<br><br>
[0049] Non-glitchless multiplexer 506 receives data input signal 504 and input select signals 502 and generates output signal 508. In an embodiment, data input signal 504 includes an 8-bit signal. In other embodiments, data input signal 504 includes two 4-bit signals, four 2-bit signals, or eight 1-bit signals. Input select signals 502 control multiplexer 506 to couple one of the received data input signals to the output of the multiplexer. Typically, the number, N, of input select signals 502 is such that 2N equals the number of data bits in signal 504. In FIG. 5, the number of input select signals 502 is 3, making multiplexer 506 an 8: 1 multiplexer.<br><br>
[0050] Since the output 508 of multiplexer 506 may be non-glitchless, serial encoder<br><br>
500 can be significantly simplified. In one aspect, data bits in input signal 504 are allowed to switch at any time and not only when they are not being selected for output, as in a glitchless multiplexer. In another aspect, the input selection sequence carried by input select signals 502 no longer need to adhere to a Gray code sequence. <br><br>
[0051] Accordingly, to generate a glitchless encoder output, a synchronizing circuit<br><br>
510 is used to ensure that any glitches in output 508 are removed at encoder output 512. In one embodiment, synchronizing circuit 510 includes a clock-driven final data register stage that enables signals contributing to the encoder output to have minimal skew relative to each other. In addition, the final data register stage is a very small number of logic layers away from the encoder output, further reducing output skew.<br><br>
[0052] FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram that illustrates an MDDI serial encoder 600 according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
[0053] Serial encoder 600 includes a data register stage, illustrated using flip-flop<br><br>
620, a select input register stage, illustrated using flip-flops 612, 614, and 616, a multiplexer 622, and a synchronizing circuit 626.<br><br>
[0054] The data register stage flip-flop 620 receives data input signal 610. In one embodiment, data input signal 610 includes an 8-bit signal. Accordingly, flip-flop 620 is an 8-bit flip-flop. In other embodiments, flip-flop 620 may be replaced with two 4-bit flip-flops, four 2-bit flip-flops, or eight 1-bit flip-flops. As illustrated in FIG. 6, flip-flop 620 is a D flip-flop, but other types of flip-flops or registers may also be used as understood by a person skilled in the art based on the teachings herein.<br><br>
[0055] The select input register stage flip-flops 612, 614, and 616 receive select input signals sel(2) 602, sel(l) 604, and sel(0) 606, respectively. Select input signals 602, 604, and 606 are typically provided by a counter and are used to select the input of multiplexer 622. Select signals 602, 604, and 606 need not adhere to any type of input selection sequence, such as a Gray code sequence, for example. Flip-flops 612, 614, and 616 are D flip-flops, but other types of flip-flops may also be used as understood by a person skilled in the art based on the teachings herein.<br><br>
[0O56] Multiplexer 622 receives data input signals from the data register stage and input select signals from the select input register stage, and generates output signal 624. In one embodiment, multiplexer 622 is an 8:1 multiplexer. <br><br>
[0057] Multiplexer 622 is a non-glitchless multiplexer. In other words, glitches may occur in output 624 of multiplexer 622. Accordingly, output 624 of multiplexer 622 is provided to a synchronizing circuit 626 to ensure that any glitches in output 624 are removed at encoder output 642.<br><br>
[0058] Synchronizing circuit 626 includes a first XOR stage, illustrated using XOR gates 628 and 630, a final data register stage, illustrated using flip-flops 632, 634, 636, and 638, and a final XOR stage, illustrated using XOR gate 640, to generate encoder output 642.<br><br>
[0059] The first XOR stage gates 628 and 630 receive output signal 624 and feedback signals from flip-flops 636 and 634, respectively. The outputs of XOR gates 628 and 630 are respectively received by flip-flops 632, 634 and 636, 638. Flip-flops 632, 634, 636, and 638 are controlled by a clock signal elk, with flip-flops 632 and 634 updating outputs at rising edges of the clock signal and flip-flops 636 and 638 updating outputs at falling edges of the clock signal.<br><br>
[0060] Flip-flops 634 and 636 are feedback flip-flops of the final data register stage having their outputs cross-coupled to XOR gates 628 and 630 of the first XOR stage. In other embodiments, the feedback signals to XOR gates 628 and 630 are provided from the outputs of flip-flops 638 and 632 respectively, with flip-flops 634 and 636 eliminated from the final data register stage. A more stable design, however, is achieved by using flip-flops 634 and 636 to provide the feedback signals to the first XOR stage. This reduces any additional routing of the outputs of flip-flops 632 and 638, which then need to only be input into the final XOR stage of synchronizing circuit 626.<br><br>
[0061] The final XOR stage of synchronizing circuit 626 includes a single XOR gate<br><br>
640, which receives the outputs of flip-flops 632 and 638 and outputs encoder output 642. Encoder output 642 is a glitchless output with low output skew.<br><br>
[0062] It is noted that in serial encoder 600, a single layer of logic separates the final data register stage from the encoder output. Accordingly, the individual skew of signals contributing to the encoder output remains very low. Further, it is noted <br><br>
that only two signals from the final data register stage (outputs of flip-flops 632 and 638) contribute to encoder output 642, further reducing output skew. The reduced number of paths from the final register stage to the encoder output also simplifies output skew analysis.<br><br>
[0063] FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram that illustrates an MDDI serial encoder 800 according to a further embodiment of the present invention. MDDI serial encoder 800 is similar in several respects to MDDI serial encoder 600 of FIG. 6, but employs a different synchronizing circuit implementation 812. It is noted that, in practice, the synchronizing circuit is equivalent to a dual edge flip-flop, and accordingly, any implementation of a dual edge flip-flop or functionally equivalent circuitry may be used for the synchronizing circuit according to embodiments of the present invention.<br><br>
[0064] In FIG. 8, synchronizing circuit 812 includes a final data register stage, illustrated using flip flops 804 and 806, and a multiplexer 808. Flip flops 804 and 806 receive output signal 624 of multiplexer 622 and are controlled by clock signal 802, with flip flop 804 updating its output at rising edges of clock signal 802 and flip flop 806 updating its output at falling edges of clock signal 802. The outputs of flip flops 804 and 806 subsequently form inputs to multiplexer 808. Multiplexer 808 is also controlled by clock signal 802, with the output of flip flop 804 being output from multiplexer 808 when the clock signal 802 is high and the output of flip flop 806 being output from multiplexer 808 when the clock signal 802 is low, to generate the encoder output 810. It is noted that, in embodiment 800, the encoder output 810 has a race condition on clock signal 802. This race condition is a result of a rising or falling edge in clock signal 802 causing the currently selected input to multiplexer 808 to change. The encoder output 810 is glitchless only if a rising or falling edge of clock signal 802 has selected the other input of the multiplexer 808 as the encoder output 810 before the current input changes. As an example, when clock signal 802 is low, the output of flip flop 806 is being output from multiplexer 808 as encoder output 810. At a rising edge of the clock signal 802, the output of flip flop 806 will <br><br>
update to a new state while at the same time the output of flip flop 804 is selected as the output of multiplexer 808 as encoder output 810. To avoid glitches on encoder output 810, the delay from clock signal 802 through multiplexer 808 to the encoder output 810 must be less than the delay from clock signal 802 through flip flops 804 or 806 to multiplexer 808. As long as this timing condition is met, encoder output 810 is a glitchless output with low output skew.<br><br>
[0065] It is also noted that in serial encoder 800, a single layer of logic separates the final data register stage from the encoder output with only two signals from the final data register stage contributing to encoder output 810, thereby resulting in a reduced output skew and simplified output skew analysis.<br><br>
Example Timing Diagrams<br><br>
[0066] FIG. 7 is an example timing diagram relating signals of MDDI serial encoder<br><br>
600 of FIG. 6. In this example diagram, the select inputs transitions, illustrated as signal sel[2:0] in FIG. 7, are in accordance "with a Gray code sequence as typically required for MDDI encoders with glitchless multiplexer. Accordingly, multiplexer 622 of FIG. 6 operates identically to a glitchless multiplexer, but without the glitch free output requirement. Note that the select inputs sequence in FIG. 7 is an exemplary one and that other select inputs sequences may also be used.<br><br>
[0067] Signal din[7:0] in FIG. 7 corresponds to data input signal 610 in FIG. 6. An exemplary sequence of signal din[7:0] is provided in FIG. 7.<br><br>
[0068] Signal din_reg[7:0] corresponds to signal din_reg[7:0] illustrated in FIG. 6, and can be generated from signal din[7:0] according to signal data_en in FIG. 7. An exemplary sequence of signal din_reg[7:0] is provided in FIG. 7.<br><br>
[0069] Signal desired_data_out corresponds to signal 624 in FIG. 6.<br><br>
[0070] Signals out_rise and out_fall correspond to the outputs of flip-flops 632 and<br><br>
638, respectively. Note that out_rise = (desired_data_out XOR out_fall) and that out_fall = (desired_data_out XOR out_rise). Also note that signal dout = out_rise <br><br>
XOR out_fall. Accordingly, either of the two final output registers can drive the desired_data_out value to dout by holding or inverting its output. Signal dout is equivalent to signal desired_data_out but is delayed by Vi clock cycle.<br><br>
[0071] FIG. 9 is an example timing diagram relating signals of MDDI serial encoder<br><br>
800 of FIG. 8. Similar to the example timing diagram of FIG. 7, the select inputs transitions, illustrated as sel[2:0] in FIG. 9, are in accordance with a Gray code sequence as typically required for MDDI encoders with glitchless multiplexer. Note, however, that the select inputs sequence illustrated in FIG. 9 is only exemplary and that other select inputs sequences may also be used.<br><br>
[0072] Signal din[7:0] in FIG. 9 corresponds to data input signal 610 in FIG. 8. An exemplary sequence of signal din[7:0} is provided in FIG. 9.<br><br>
[0073] Signal din_reg[7:0] corresponds to the output of flip-flop 620 in FIG. 8. An exemplary sequence of signal din_reg[7:0] is provided in FIG. 9.<br><br>
[0074] Signal desired_data_out corresponds to signal 624 in FIG. 8.<br><br>
[0075] Signals pos_reg and neg_reg correspond to the outputs of flip-flops 804 and<br><br>
806, respectively, in FIG. 8.<br><br>
[0076] Signal dout corresponds to encoder output dout 810 in FIG. 8. Note that dout is equivalent to desired_data_out signal, but is delayed by 1 clock cycle, with Vi clock cycle delay due to flip-flops 804 and 806 and Vi clock cycle delay due to multiplexer 808.<br><br>
