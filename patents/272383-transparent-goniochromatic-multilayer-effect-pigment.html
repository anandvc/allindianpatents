TRANSPARENT GONIOCHROMATIC MULTILAYER EFFECT PIGMENT<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/652,020, filed February 12, 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Effect pigments, also known as pearlescent or nacreous pigments, are<br>
based on the use of a laminar substrate such as mica or glass flake which has<br>
been coated with a metal oxide layer. These pigments exhibit pearl-like luster as<br>
a result of reflection and refraction of light, and depending on the thickness of the<br>
metal oxide layer, they can also exhibit interference color effects.<br>
Titanium dioxide-coated mica and iron oxide-coated mica effect pigments<br>
are the effect pigments which are encountered most often on a commercial basis.<br>
Pigments in which the metal oxide has been over-coated with another material<br>
are also well known in the art.<br>
The commercially available effect pigments which contain only a single<br>
coating of a high refractive index material provide only two reflecting interfaces<br>
between materials. These two material interfaces (and reflections) are therefore<br>
solely responsible for the reflectivity achieved from the platelet surface. A<br>
substantial percentage of the incident light is thus transmitted through the platelet<br>
and while this is necessary to create the nacreous appearance of the pigment, it<br>
also diminishes other desirable properties of the effect pigments such as luster,<br>
chromaticity and hiding power. To counteract this consequence, the art has either<br>
mixed the effect pigments with other pigments or added additional layers of<br>
transparent and/or selectively absorbing materials onto the effect pigment.<br>
Examples of prior art describing multi-coated effect pigments include JP<br>
7-246366, WO 98/53011, WO 98/53012 and U.S. Patent No. 4,434,010. All of<br>
such prior art requires that each coated layer possess an optical thickness equal to<br>
a whole number multiple of a one-quarter of the wavelength at which interference<br>
is expected. Such construction of the so-called quarter-wave stacks is a widely<br>
accepted and implemented condition in the thin-film industries. Because of this<br>
limitation, a unique layer thickness combination is essential in order to create<br>
each individual one of the interference colors of the visible spectrum. The base<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
2<br>
substrate is the only dimension common to all of the compositions displaying<br>
different interference colors.<br>
It has now been discovered that the adherence to the quarter-wave stack<br>
approach is unnecessary and suitable products, even with substantial gains in<br>
luster, chromaticity and hiding power, can be achieved without observing that<br>
requirement. Further, numerous other advantages can be realized.<br>
It is accordingly the object of this invention to provide a new multilayer<br>
effect pigment, including having improved luster, chromaticity and/or hiding<br>
power relative to other effect pigments.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a multilayer effect pigment and more<br>
particularly, to a multilayer effect pigment which includes a transparent substrate<br>
having a transparent high refractive index material layer thereon and at least one<br>
pair of layers which are a transparent high refractive index material and a<br>
transparent low refractive index material, in which the total number of layers is<br>
an odd number, in which every two adjacent non-substrate layers differ in<br>
refractive index by at least about 0.2 and in which at least one layer has an optical<br>
thickness which is different from all of the other layers, whereby the pigment is<br>
not a quarter-wave stack.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a multilayer effect pigment<br>
comprising: a transparent substrate having a first layer of titanium dioxide<br>
thereon, the optical thickness of the first layer of titanium dioxide being such as<br>
to provide a white hue to the substrate;<br>
a second layer of a low refractive index material on the first layer and an<br>
outermost layer of a high refractive index material placed on the second layer;<br>
the outermost layer comprising titanium dioxide having a optical<br>
thickness of from about 45 to 240 nm, the second layer of low refractive index<br>
material having a optical thickness of at least 150 nm to provide a variable<br>
pathlength for light dependent on the angle of incidence of light impinging<br>
thereon;<br>
each layer differs in refractive index from any adjacent layer by at least<br>
about 0.2 and wherein at least one layer has an optical thickness which is<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
3<br>
different from all of the other layers, whereby the pigment is not a quarter-wave<br>
stack; and the multilayer effect pigment having a non-white hue.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the effect pigment is a<br>
multilayered product composed of a transparent substrate having an odd number<br>
of layers thereon and in which at least one of the layers has an optical thickness<br>
which is different from all of the other layers causing the pigment not to be a<br>
quarter-wave stack.<br>
Any encapsulatable smooth and transparent platelet can be used as the<br>
substrate in the present invention. Examples of useable platelets include mica,<br>
whether natural or synthetic, kaolin, glass flakes, bismuth oxychloride, platy<br>
aluminum oxide, or any transparent platelet of the proper dimensions. The<br>
substrate need not be totally transparent but should, preferably, have at least<br>
about 75% transmission. The size of the platelet shaped substrate is not critical<br>
per se and can be adapted to the particular use. Generally, the particles have<br>
major dimensions averaging about 5-250 microns, preferably 5-100 microns, and<br>
an aspect ratio greater than about 5. The specific free surface area (BET) of the<br>
substrate is, in general, from about 0.2 to 25 m2/g.<br>
The layers encapsulating the substrate alternate between high refractive<br>
index materials and low refractive index materials. High refractive index<br>
materials include those with a refractive index from about 2.00 to about 3.10.<br>
Low refractive index materials include those with a refractive index from about<br>
1.30 to about 1.80. The high refractive index materials may be anatase titanium<br>
dioxide, rutile titanium dioxide, iron oxide, zirconium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc<br>
sulfide, bismuth oxychloride or the like.<br>

The phrase "a transparent substrate having a layer of titanium dioxide thereon" as<br>
used herein means that the titanium dioxide may be in direct contact with the<br>
transparent substrate or additives or other layers may be present between the<br>
transparent substrate and the layer of titanium dioxide. The phrase "a layer of a<br>
low refractive index material on said titanium dioxide layer" as used herein<br>
means that the low refractive index material layer may be in direct contact with<br>
the titanium dioxide layer or additives or other layers may be present between the<br>
low refractive index material layer and the titanium dioxide layer. The phrase<br>
"outermost titanium dioxide layer on said low refractive index material layer" as<br>
used herein means that the outermost titanium dioxide layer may be in direct<br>
contact with said low refractive index material layer or additives or other layers<br>
may be present between the low refractive index material layer and the outermost<br>
titanium dioxide layer.<br>
The individual layers can be applied to the substrate and to each other<br>
using techniques well known in the art. Any such technique can be utilized. One<br>
of the advantages of the invention is that sol-gel techniques can be used to apply<br>
the coatings. Such techniques are well known and widely practiced for thin film<br>
deposition, and are safe, economical and amenable to a wide variety of particle<br>
shapes and sizes. Chemical vapor deposition techniques which have been used in<br>
some prior art have a litany of negative aspects including safety hazards,<br>
expensive reagents and infrastructure and substrate particle size limitations.<br>
Monolithic web-based multilayer coating techniques have also been used in the<br>
prior art and suffer from the disadvantages that pigment particles are formed after<br>
the coatings are applied and therefore have discontinuities in the layers at the<br>
fracture points. The particles must also be classified according to size after the<br>
monolith is fractured, whereas in the present invention the particle size can be<br>
predetermined before the coating and can be constant. Useful additives include<br>
rutile directors for titanium dioxide such as tin.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the substrate and all<br>
layers have an appreciable degree of transparency and therefore the resulting<br>
pigments can exhibit unique angle dependent reflectivity ranging from nearly<br>
totally reflecting to substantially transmitting as the viewing angle is changed.<br>
Many multi-coated pigments in the prior art use metal flakes as substrates and<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
6<br>
such metal layers are not capable of transmitting light and the resulting pigment<br>
is therefore totally opaque.<br>
Because the pigment is not a quarter-wave stack, the first layer which is<br>
adjacent the substrate can be given a fixed optical thickness and by varying the<br>
thickness of the other layers, it is possible to prepare all of the interference colors<br>
desired. Further, the first and second coating layers may be fixed and such<br>
coated substrates may be used to prepare multiple final products by variation of<br>
the final layer only. The number of unique layer combinations necessary to<br>
prepare all of the interference colors with the present invention is much less than<br>
for the prior art. The adherence to the quarter-wave optical thickness condition<br>
for the layers of the prior art compositions precludes the use of universal single or<br>
double coated precursors to three layer compositions.<br>
While any odd number of layers equal to or greater than three can be<br>
employed, it has been found that substantial advantages are present when there<br>
are three layers and this is therefore preferred.<br>
As described below, the thicknesses of each of the individual layers<br>
applied to the substrate are described as the optical thickness values. Optical<br>
thickness is the product of the actual physical or geometric thickness (t) of the<br>
layer and the refractive index (n) of the material of the layer. While it may be<br>
possible to measure the physical thickness of the deposited layer on the substrate,<br>
the refractive index of the applied material will vary from published values<br>
depending on the density and uniformity of the deposited layer. Typically, the<br>
tabulated values of refractive index are well known but such values are<br>
determined from a uniform and highly packed structure and are almost always<br>
higher than the refractive index values of the actual layers deposited via the<br>
techniques of this invention. Accordingly, it may be difficult to obtain the desired<br>
color by simply applying the respective materials at a prescribed physical<br>
thickness of the layer in as much as the refractive index may vary widely<br>
depending on the density and uniformity of the coating. However, the optical<br>
thickness can be indirectly determined by measuring the wavelengths at which<br>
interferences occur in the sample and then solving for "nt" in the well-known<br>
constructive interference and/or destructive interference equations. The equations<br>
as written below are for normal angle incidence of light only, in which the cosine<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
7<br>
 term reduces to 1 and does not need to appear, in the interest of simplifying the<br>
present discussion.<br>
Constructive interference equation: nt=m λ/4 where in m =odd integer<br>
n = refractive index of the film material<br>
t = geometric (physical) thickness of the film material, in<br>
nanometers<br>
λ = the wavelength of maximum reflection, in nanometers<br>
nt = optical thickness of the film material, in nanometers<br>
Destructive interference equation: nt=m λ/2 where in m=any positive<br>
integer<br>
λ = the wavelength of minimum reflection, in nanometers<br>
By measuring the interference wavelength λ from samples having the<br>
desired color after each layer deposition, the optical thickness of each layer can<br>
be readily determined. It is important to note that in this invention, the optical<br>
thicknesses of all the layers are not the same and as such, the pigment of the<br>
present invention does not represent the typical quarter wave stack. A layer<br>
having the appropriate whole integer multiple for the coefficient "m" in the<br>
equations is considered to possess the same optical thickness as the m = 1 case,<br>
and therefore construction of a stack of layers in which the integer m is varied at<br>
a constant λ is still considered a quarter-wave stack based on its function. This<br>
practice is therefore avoided in this invention. Surprisingly, it has been found that<br>
non-quarter wave stack pigments can yield desired colors contrary to what was<br>
long considered in the art, that the optical thicknesses of all the layers had to be<br>
the same.<br>
The low refractive index material is preferably silica and while this can<br>
have other thicknesses, the silica layer preferably has a optical thickness of at<br>
least 150 nm, preferably in the range of about 180-730 nm, and more preferably<br>
about 215-470 nm. This maximizes the degree of angle dependent color travel,<br>
which is inherent in silica films. In this invention, the silica layers will have a<br>
optical thickness to provide a variable pathlength for light dependent on the angle<br>
of incidence of light impinging thereon. It is preferred that the low refractive<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
8<br>
index material layer have a sufficient thickness to provide greater than 75 and,<br>
more preferably, more than 100 degrees of hue angle color travel.<br>
The first layer on the substrate and the outermost layer can be the same or<br>
different, and are further preferably titanium dioxide. It will be appreciated that<br>
where the first or innermost layer has a fixed optical thickness and the low<br>
refractive index layer also has a predetermined optical thickness, the outermost<br>
high refractive index layer will control the interference color as a result of its<br>
optical thickness. The substrate/first layer/second layer combination thus acts as a<br>
universal base from which all interference colors can be realized by simply<br>
varying the optical thickness of the third layer. In general, it is useful to provide<br>
a first layer of titanium dioxide on the substrate, which will lead to a preliminary<br>
white-colored material. As such, the optical thickness of the first titanium<br>
dioxide layer will generally range from about 105 to 155 nm.<br>
The optical thickness of the third layer, when it is titania, in such an<br>
arrangement generally varies from about 45 to 240 nm, and preferably about 95-<br>
240 nm. More consistent color can be achieved if the outermost titania layer has<br>
an optical thickness of at least 95 nm. The pigments of this invention have non-<br>
white hues. A "non-white" hue according to this invention means the pigments<br>
of this invention will have a chromaticity (0° C*) of at least 40.0 and are not a<br>
white to pearl or silvery color.<br>
The phrase "grazing angle" as used herein means a viewing angle that is<br>
almost parallel to the sample surface. This is in contrast to the phrase "face<br>
angle" which means a viewing angle that is almost perpendicular to the sample<br>
surface.<br>
The products of the present invention can be used in any application<br>
where pearlescent pigments have been used heretofore. Thus, the products of this<br>
invention have an unlimited use in all types of automotive and industrial paint<br>
applications, especially in the organic color coating and inks field where deep<br>
color intensity is required. For example, these pigments can be used in mass tone<br>
or as styling agents to spray paint all types of automotive and non-automotive<br>
vehicles.	Similarly,	they	can	be	used	on	all<br>
clay/formica/wood/glass/metal/enamel/ceramic and non-porous or porous<br>
surfaces. The pigments can be used in powder coating compositions. They can be<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
9<br>
incorporated into plastic articles geared for the toy industry or the home. These<br>
pigments can be impregnated into fibers to impart new and esthetic coloring to<br>
clothes and carpeting. They can be used to improve the look of shoes, rubber and<br>
vinyl/marble flooring, vinyl siding, and all other vinyl products. In addition, these<br>
colors can be used in all types of modeling hobbies.<br>
The above-mentioned compositions in which the compositions of this<br>
invention are useful are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples<br>
include printing inks, nail enamels, lacquers, thermoplastic and thermosetting<br>
materials, natural resins and synthetic resins. Some non-limiting examples<br>
include polystyrene and its mixed polymers, polyolefins, in particular,<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, polyacrylic compounds, polyvinyl compounds,<br>
for example polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate, polyesters and rubber, and<br>
also filaments made of viscose and cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, polyamides,<br>
polyurethanes, polyesters, for example polyglycol terephthalates. and<br>
polyacrylonitrile.<br>

insect repellent lotion, mascara cake/cream, nail enamel, nail enamel remover,<br>
perfume lotion, and shampoos of all types (gel or liquid). In addition, they can be<br>
used in shaving cream (concentrate for aerosol, brushless, lathering), skin glosser<br>
stick, skin makeup, hair groom, eye shadow (liquid, pomade, powder, stick,<br>
pressed or cream), eye liner, cologne stick, cologne, cologne emollient, bubble<br>
bath, body lotion (moisturizing, cleansing, analgesic, astringent), after shave<br>
lotion, after bath milk and sunscreen lotion.<br>
The present effect pigments may also be used in combination with food or<br>
beverages or to coat foods.<br>
In order to further illustrate the invention, various examples are set forth<br>
below. In these examples, as well as throughout this specification and claims, all<br>
parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in degrees<br>
Centigrade, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A 5 liter Morton flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and charged<br>
with a suspension of 150 grams of mica of average diameter 50 microns in 1.0<br>
liter of H2O. The slurry was heated to 74° C and stirred at 200 RPM and lowered<br>
to pH 2.2 with HC1. A 40% TiCl4 solution was pumped in at 0.75 mls. per minute<br>
at pH 2.2 until the mica shade was a white pearl, requiring 190 grams of solution.<br>
The pH was kept constant by adding 35% NaOH solution during the addition.<br>
The slurry pH was raised rapidly to 8.25 by adding 35% NaOH solution,<br>
and the stirring rate was raised to 250 RPM. 1563.0 grams of 20% Na2SiO3 •<br>
5H2O solution were added at 5.7 grams/minute while maintaining the pH at 8.25<br>
with 28% HC1 solution. A small sample of suspension was then filtered and<br>
calcined at 850° C. The interference color of the platelet was yellow as predicted<br>
from the titania plus silica film combination.<br>
The suspension pH was then lowered to 2.2 by adding 28% HC1 solution<br>
at a rate of 0.75 mls/ minute. The stirring rate was lowered again to 200 RPM.<br>
The second titania layer was coated by again adding 40% TiCl4 solution at 0.75<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
11<br>
mls/minute. A few small samples of suspension were filtered, calcined at 850° C,<br>
and evaluated in drawdown until the target product was obtained at 253 grams of<br>
added 40% TiCl4. The entire suspension was then processed to yield the desired<br>
calcined product which exhibited a high chromaticity green normal color which<br>
flopped to a violet color at a grazing angle of the drawdown card. The color<br>
properties of the pigment agreed with the properties of Sample 19 in the Table of<br>
Example 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A 5 liter Morton flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and charged<br>
with a suspension of 832 grams of borosilicate glass flake of average diameter<br>
100 microns in 1.67 liters of H2O. The suspension was heated to 80° C, stirred at<br>
300 RPM and adjusted to pH 1.4 with 28% HC1. 47.0 grams of 20% SnCl4 • 5H2O<br>
solution were pumped in at 2.4 grams per minute while maintaining the pH at 1.4<br>
with 35% NaOH solution, and then the suspension was stirred for a 30 minute<br>
digestion period at temperature.<br>
A 40% TiCl4 solution was added at 2.0 grams per minute until a white<br>
pearl shade was imparted to the glass at 144 grams of added solution. No sample<br>
was withdrawn, and the suspension pH was rapidly raised to 8.25 by adding 35%<br>
NaOH solution, which was also used to control the pH at 1.4 during the TiCl4<br>
addition. The temperature was lowered to 74° C, and then 1290.0 grams of 20%<br>
Na2SiO3 • 5H2O solution were added at 5.4 grams per minute while controlling<br>
the pH at 8.25 with 28% HC1 solution. A small sample of the suspension was<br>
filtered and calcined at 625° C.<br>
The suspension pH was lowered to 1.4 with 28% HC1 solution added at<br>
0.8 mis/minute, and the temperature was returned to 80° C. The previous SnCl4 •<br>
5H2O addition step was repeated verbatim, as was the 40% TiCl4 addition. Three<br>
samples of the suspension were filtered and calcined at 625° C after 106 grams,<br>
164 grams and 254 grams of added TiCl4 solution respectively. The normal<br>
interference colors of the 3 samples were blue, turquoise and green which flopped<br>
to red, violet and blue-violet respectively at grazing viewing angles. The green<br>
normal color sample was essentially an exact analog to the final product yielded<br>
in Example 1. All three samples exhibited substantially higher chromaticity than<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
12<br>
the commercially available singly coated glass flake products (Engelhard<br>
Corporation REFLECKS™). The blue pigment had color properties which<br>
agreed with Sample 8 of the Table in Example 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Following the general procedure given in Example 2, a red to yellow<br>
color shifting effect pigment was prepared by repeating the first TiO2 layer white<br>
pearl shade of Example 1, adding 860.3 grams of the 20% Na2SiO3 • 5H2O<br>
solution, and a final TiO2 layer from 293 grams of 40% TiCl4 solution. The<br>
pigment had color properties which agreed with Sample 3 of the Table of<br>
Example 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Following the general procedure given in Example 2, a violet to orange<br>
color shifting effect pigment was prepared by repeating the first TiO2 layer white<br>
pearl shade, adding 1147.0 grams of the 20% Na2SiO3 • 5H2O solution, and a<br>
final TiO2 layer from 133 grams of added 40% TiCl4 solution. The pigment had<br>
color properties which agreed with Sample 5 of the Table of Example 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
A 5 liter Morton flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and charged<br>
with a suspension of 250 grams of borosilicate glass flake of average diameter 81<br>
microns and a BET specific surface area measured at 0.75 m2/gr. in 1.2 liters of<br>
H2O. The suspension was heated to 82° C, stirred at 300 RPM and adjusted to pH<br>
1.4 with 28% HC1. 56.0 grams of 20% SnCl4 • 5H2O solution were pumped in at<br>
2.4 grams per minute while maintaining the pH at 1.4 with 35% NaOH solution,<br>
and then the suspension was stirred for a 30 minute digestion period at<br>
temperature.<br>
A 40% TiCl4 solution was added at 2.0 grams per minute until a white<br>
pearl shade was imparted to the glass at 173 grams of added solution. No sample<br>
was withdrawn, and the suspension pH was rapidly raised to 8.25 by adding 35%<br>
NaOH solution, which was also used to control the pH at 1.4 during the TiCl4<br>
addition. The temperature was lowered to 74° C, and then 1393.8 grams of 20%<br>
 <br>
5099A<br>
13<br>
Na2SiO3 • 5H2O solution were added at 5.4 grams per minute while controlling<br>
the pH at 8.25 with 28% HC1 solution. A small sample of the suspension was<br>
filtered and calcined at 625° C and the dry interference color was the same as that<br>
of the titania plus silica combination in example 1.<br>
The suspension pH was lowered to 1.4 with 28% HC1 solution added at<br>
1.0 mis/minute, and the temperature was returned to 82° C. The previous SnCl4 •<br>
5H2O addition step was repeated verbatim, as was the 40% TiCl4 addition. Three<br>
samples of the suspension were filtered and calcined at 625° C after 133 grams,<br>
190 grams and 281 grams of added TiCl4 solution respectively. The normal<br>
interference colors of the 3 samples were blue, turquoise and green which flopped<br>
to red, violet and blue-violet respectively at grazing viewing angles. The 3<br>
samples were essentially exact analogs to the products yielded in Example 2.<br>
