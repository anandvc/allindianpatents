The present invention envisages ready-to-use electric insulation coating and a process for producing the same.<br>
Background<br>
An insulator is a material that resists the flow of an electric current. Purpose of the electric insulation system is to ensure safety of human beings by avoiding current leakage from the live objects like conductors, bush bars, overhead cables, poles, etc., to ensure safety of electric equipments by avoiding flashovers due to vermin entries, moisture, contaminations etc, to safeguard maintenance engineer during repairs &amp; rectification. Insulating material should satisfy the following requirements:<br>
•	Resistance to UV Radiation <br>
•	Resistance to Moisture<br>
•	Resistance to Puncture<br>
•	Resistance to Fire<br>
•	Ease of Application<br>
•	On Site Application<br>
Various Insulating Materials that are currently used include PVC Heat shrinkable Sleeves, Polyester sleeves, Shrouds, Insulating Papers, XLP Coating, Epoxy Coating LDPE Coating.<br>
However, the above mentioned insulating materials suffer from one or more of the shortcomings which include the insulating materials not suitable for outdoor exposure. In many cases, it is not possible to use the electrical insulating material for on-site application because of the form in which they are used. Furthermore, the application of the electrical insulating material is a very complicated process which necessitates various equipment and skilled man power. This adds to the overall cost of insulation. Still furthermore, once the insulation material is applied further touch up as well as rectification can prove to be a cumbersome and tedious exercise, especially because of the equipment and the man-power involved. Incase of fire, some of the insulating material releases harmful gases. Further the presently used electric insulation systems are all solid type of material. Storage, Handling, Usage &amp; maintenance are of big concern.<br>
Moreover, all the properties of an ideal electrical insulation system as mentioned above cannot be fulfilled by either of the systems and use of such products is limited to specific service conditions<br>
There thus exists a need for a simple cost effective electric insulation coating which is easy to handle, easy to apply and which offers flexibility as regards to the maintenance and touch up options.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an electric insulation coating suitable for an on-site application.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an electric insulation coating that is easily applied on variety of surfaces by spraying, dipping, brushing , bar coating or rolling.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an electric insulation coating that does not necessitate complicated equipments and skilled man power.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an electric insulation coating that is in ready-to-use form.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an electric insulation coating that is air dried at room temperature and does not necessitate the external drying equipments.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an electric insulation coating that can be applied to the conducting surface without any prior special surface treatment of the conducting material.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an electrical insulation coating that has high electrical strength and high tracking resistance.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a cost effective electrical insulation coating.<br>

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing the Polymeric Based Electric Insulation coating comprising:<br>
a) Polymerizing a resinous mixture containing 10 to 60% by weight of styrenic based monomers, 5 to 45% by weight of acrylate based, monomers and 20 to 60% by weight of methacrylate based monomers in the presence of about 0,1- about 3 % initiators by weight of total monomers and 20-70% solvent by weight of total monomers at a temperature range of about 50°C to about 150°C;<br>

d)	adding 5 to 20% fillers by weight of composition and 2 to 25% additives by weight of composition to the resultant thermoplastic polymer to obtain a coating composition for electric insulation.<br>
In the present invention, mixture of initiators based on organic peroxides and organic azo compounds such as Benzoyl Peroxide and azobisisobutyronitrile are used in a proportion of 0.1 to 3 % by weight of total monomers<br>
In a peculiar polymerization reaction, monomers in specified proportion are added at a time to the reactor. Mix of initiators are dissolved either in monomers or in 20 to 70 % solvents based on aromatic hydrocarbons like Toluene, xylene etc. Reactants are heated with continuous agitation. The reactants are heated and polymerization reaction is carried out in the temperature range of 50 to 150°C for a period of about 2 to 10 hrs to obtain thermoplastic polymer. <br>
The initiator mixture is dissolved in the monomer premix and the resultant resinous mixture is polymerized by Bulk or Solution polymerization technique, preferably polymerization is allowed to advance until the degree of conversion to thermoplastic polymer reaches to 60 to 99 %.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, 85 to 90 % conversion to polymer is essential to develop high electric strength values. The high conversion is achieved by using 0.5 to 2 % of initiator mix comprising of Bezoyl Peroxide &amp; azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN).<br>
In case of bulk polymerization or solution polymerization, the chain transfer agent is preferably added at a stage where the degree of conversion of thermoplastic polymer reaches 70 to 90%.<br>

Typically, the ratio of weight-average molecular weight, Mw to number average molecular weight Mn ( Mw / Mn) or molecular weight distribution of thermoplastic polymer measured by GPC must be within range of 2 to 5 to obtain desired performance properties as a coating.<br>
Similarly at higher molecular weight the mechanical, chemical, physical properties improve but the application with conventional tools becomes very difficult resulting into cob-webbing. At lower molecular weight, application becomes easy but loss of properties of the polymer makes the composition of no practical use.<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the following examples which do not limit the invention in any way and only exemplify the invention.<br>

The polymerizaton is carried out at temperature ranging from 50 to 150° C in the presence of mixture of initiators like benzoyl peroxide and AIBN 0.1 to 3% and organic solvent like toluene, xylene in the range of 20 to 70%. Once the polymer conversion is reached to 85 to 95 % the polymer, chain transfer agent is added to yield thermoplastic polymer. The thermoplastic polymer is cooled to 35°C. Coating composition is prepared using above polymer, colorants &amp; Coating additives. <br>
