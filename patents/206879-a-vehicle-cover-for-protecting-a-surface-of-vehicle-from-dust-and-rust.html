				<td>A VEHICLE COVER FOR PROTECTING A SURFACE OF VEHICLE FROM DUST AND RUST<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle cover for protecting the exterior finish and maintaining aesthetic appeal of a vehicle, and more particularly, the present invention relates to a vehicle cover which is installed on the body of a vehicle for protecting paint finish exposed to natural conditions such as foreign materials, sunlight, and the like.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, as a painted surface of a vehicle is exposed to foreign materials including small pebbles, debris, dust, smog, and so forth and weather elements such as sunlight comprising of strong ultraviolet rays, rainwater, etc., there is a possibility for the painted surface to undergo quality degradation such as discoloring and scratching.<br>
In the case of a vehicle discharged from a factory, before it is delivered to a dealer or purchaser, the exterior finish of the vehicle must be protected to the<br>
1<br><br>
maximum. In particular, this has critical importance when the vehicle is stored for a lengthy period of time at a wharf or ship for export.<br>
In order to export a vehicle, about 6 months are required for conducting customs formalities and transportation. In this regard, a method for attaching an opaque vinyl wrapper to the vehicle using adhesive, and a method of applying a rust resistor to the vehicle are disclosed in the art as a technique for protecting a painted surface of a vehicle.<br>
Also, when a hood of a vehicle is opened by a ring suspended to an elastic string band in the hood cover, a method for holding the hood cover to the vehicle body with inserting it into an opening inside of a hood grille, or a method for holding the hood cover to the vehicle body with inserting a fitting means into a gap of both rear ends of the trunk is used.<br>
However, in the method for attaching an opaque vinyl wrapper to the vehicle using adhesive, problems are induced in that adhesive remains on the surface of a vehicle, and due to difficulties in mounting and removing the opaque vinyl wrapper, a number of workers and a long period of time are required. Therefore, loss is caused in terms of both time and cost.<br>
2<br><br>
Moreover, in the method of applying a rust resistor to the vehicle, drawbacks are provoked in that the paint finish is likely to be discolored when bird droppings adhere thereto. Further, since wastewater is produced upon washing a vehicle to remove the rust resistor, environmental pollution is incurred. Consequently, the use of the rust resistor is not allowed in a diversity of countries.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problems occurring in the related art, and the object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle cover which is easily mounted and removed from a vehicle and does not cause any environmental pollution.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a vehicle cover comprising: a hood cover segment to cover the hood of the vehicle; a roof cover segment for covering a roof of the vehicle; and a trunk cover segment for covering a trunk door of the vehicle.<br>
Due to the features of the present invention, by deploying and installing the cover segments on the hood, roof,  and trunk door of the vehicle respectively,  the<br>
3<br><br>
mounting operation of the vehicle cover as a whole is completed and it is possible to protect the vehicle body and paint finish thereon.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br><br>
The above objects, and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent after reading the following detailed descriptions when read in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a plan view illustrating a hood cover segment;<br>
FIG. 2 is a plan view illustrating a roof cover segment;<br>
FIG. 3 is a plan view illustrating a trunk cover segment; and<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view illustrating the state wherein a vehicle cover for protecting a surface of vehicle from dust and rust, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, is installed on a vehicle.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in greater detail to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.   Wherever<br>
4<br><br><br>
possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings and the descriptions to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
A vehicle cover according to the present invention is formed by super-fine, high-density, non-directional polyethylene fiber. Each strand of which has a diameter of 0.5-10  m. Due to the fact that the vehicle cover is formed by heat and pressure without addition of any binder or filler, the vehicle cover is lightweight and durable and has excellent elasticity and flexibility. Furthermore, since the vehicle cover does not produce dust, it does not induce any flaws on a painted surface of a vehicle.<br>
Also, the vehicle cover in accordance with the present invention does not react with acid, alkali, saline matter, and so on. It has chemical resistance which enables the vehicle cover not to be susceptible to chemical substances. The vehicle cover is not torn while conducting folding and unfolding operations in excess of 20,000 times and has conformability by which it smoothly fits about an undulating surface contour of a vehicle body.<br>
In addition, even in the case that the surface of the vehicle body holds moisture, it is dried in a short period of time, because the vehicle cover has air permeability and waterproofness. Thus, the painted surface of the vehicle body can always be maintained in a dried state. The vehicle<br>
5<br><br>
cover does not absorb moisture even in high humidity climatic conditions, and thus moisture proof of the vehicle cover is ensured so that mold does not gather thereon.<br>
Furthermore, the vehicle cover has heat and ultraviolet ray insulating characteristics, and is made from antistatic material such that it can exhibit optimum performance for protecting the painted surface of the vehicle body.<br>
FIG. 1 is a plan view illustrating a hood cover (10). In order to install the hood cover, an end (19) of the hood cover (10) is inserted into an inside of the hood, and then double-sided tapes (11, 12, 13, 14) are attached to all four ends of the hood cover (10) so that the cover is directly attached to the hood of the vehicle body, thereby inflow of rainwater or foreign materials is effectively prevented through perfect closeness of the hood cover. A coated tape is provided to the attached portion of the double-sided tape to attach and/or detach it several times. Therefore, the hood cover (10) can be recycled.<br>
Also, the end (19) of the hood cover is double-sewed so as to reinforce it. Therefore, the end (19) is not teared. Further, the end (19) of the hood cover forms a reference point of working. A silicon tape (18) is provided to connect a tape release paper to each cutting portion of<br>
6<br><br>
the roof cover (20) into undulating surfaces of the variety of vehicle parts, the roof cover (20) is cutted from the cutting line (28-1), after the cutted cover (20) is attached to the vehicle body, a reinforcement tape (28) is attached on it.<br>
To easily remove and/or install the cover attached to the vehicle body, a triangle tape release paper (29) is provided.<br>
FIG. 3 is a plan view illustrating a trunk cover (30) . In order to install the trunk cover, an end (39) of the trunk cover is inserted into an inside of the trunk, and then double-sided tapes (31, 32, 33, 34) are attached to all four ends of the trunk cover (30) so that the cover is directly attached to the trunk of the vehicle body. The end .(39) of the trunk cover (30) forms a reference point of working, and the installation of the trunk cover is easily achieved by the end (39) of the trunk cover. Further, in order to easily attach the double-sided tapes to the vehicle body, a tape release paper (35) is provided. The tape release paper (35) is externally protruded from the double-sided tape(31), thereby the tape release paper (35) can be easily removed from the double-sided tape (31).<br>
In order to fix a shape of the tape release paper (35) to the protruded state of it, a silicon tape (36) is<br>
8<br><br>
provided. Therefore, the trunk cover (30) can be attached to the vehicle body in a short time.<br>
A triangle tape release paper (37) is provided to easily remove and/or install the trunk cover (30) attached to the vehicle body.<br>
Also, after the covers (10, 20, 30) are removed, a remaining tape on the vehicle body is cleared by a rectangular tape release paper.<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view illustrating a state wherein a vehicle cover in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is installed on a vehicle.<br>
In FIG. 4, the vehicle cover according to the present invention includes a hood cover (10), a roof cover (20) and a trunk cover(30) which is divided into three parts.<br>
As described above, by dividing the vehicle body into three parts and installing the corresponding cover segments on the three parts, mounting of the vehicle cover is fulfilled.<br>
The vehicle cover according to the present invention has characterizing features in that it comprises three separate cover segments in such a manner that it not only protects the painted finish of the vehicle, but also does not impose a limitation on the usual travel of the vehicle, such as transportation, inspection, shipping, etc.<br>
9<br><br>
In the case that the vinyl wrapper is used as in the conventional art, air bubbles flow into the space between each cover segment and the corresponding part of the vehicle. If moisture inflow occurs, since moisture cannot be easily vaporized and discharged to the outside, the painted surface of the vehicle body can be damaged.<br>
In the present invention, two persons can complete a mounting operation of the vehicle cover as a whole in 2-3 minutes by simply installing the cover segments on the corresponding parts of the vehicle, and thus workability is improved. In the case that the vinyl wrapper is used as in the conventional art, 10 times the amount of the above-described time is needed. Further, in the case that an elastic string band or an insertion means is used, many workers and long working time is required.<br>
By the fact that the variety of parts of the vehicle are separately covered or obscured by the cover segments, it is not necessary to remove the cover segments from the vehicle for the purpose of inspection or movement of the corresponding vehicle. An initial painted state is maintained, and mounting and removing operations of the cover segments are not needed to be repeatedly performed.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The cover segments according to the present invention are configured, that is, designed and cut in a manner such<br>
10<br><br>
that they fit about undulating surfaces of the variety of vehicle parts. As a consequence, inflow of foreign materials between the cover segments and the variety of parts is prevented, and rattling of the cover segments while running is minimized. Hence, a design which remarkably reduces the likelihood of fine scratches to be formed on the painted surface of the vehicle body, is achieved. Due to the fact that the cover segments are separately installed on the variety of parts (for example, a hood, a door, a trunk door or the like), painted finish protection of the vehicle and mounting convenience of the vehicle cover are enhanced to the maximum.<br>
A coating-treated tape is provided to an attaching portion of a double-sided tape so that the double-sided tape can be attached and detached several times. Accordingly, the cover segments can be reused.<br>
Moreover, because the vehicle cover is made of polyethylene fiber, upon disposal of a wasted vehicle cover by burning under proper circumstances, precipitates and other environmental polluting substances are not created. Consequently, the vehicle cover according to the present invention is advantageous in view of the protection of the environment.<br>
Additionally, when the vehicle cover is installed on the vehicle, a fresh outer appearance is rendered to the<br>
11<br><br>
finished vehicle. In the case that a logo, etc. are printed on the vehicle cover, advertising effectiveness and reliability of the finished vehicle to a customer can be accomplished.<br>
In the drawings and specifications, there have been<br>
disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in<br>
a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes<br>
of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth<br>
