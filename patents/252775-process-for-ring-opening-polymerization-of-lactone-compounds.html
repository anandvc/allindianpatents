[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for ring-opening polymerization using an activated carbon as a catalyst, and a catalyst for ring-opening polymerization. Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Ring-opening polymerization is a polymerization process in which polymerization proceeds as a result of ring opening of a cyclic compound as a monomer to synthetically yield a polymer.  Industrially important synthetic polymers such as nylons (polyamides), polyesters, polyethers, polyethyleneimines, and polysiloxanes are now produced through ring-opening polymerization.<br>
[0003]<br>
In general, a catalyst must be added to a reaction system so as to develop ring-opening polymerization.  The catalyst herein acts upon the cyclic compound and accelerates its ring-opening reaction.  For example, catalysts for cation-reactive monomers such as cyclic ethers, cyclic formals, and cyclic imines include Lewis acids such<br>
as BF3-O(C2H5)2, SnCl4, and A1C13; alkyl halides such as alkyl chlorides and alkyl bromides; super strong acids such as CF3SO3H; esters of super strong acids, such as CF3SO3R, wherein R represents an alkyl group; and cation salts such as R3C+PF6~ and R3O+BF4~, wherein R represents an alkyl group. Catalysts for anion-reactive monomers such as cyclic siloxanes, lactams, and acid anhydrides include Li, Na, K, RCOONa, RONa, and R2NLi, wherein R represents an alkyl group. As a catalyst for a fluorooxetane, there is disclosed an alkali metal fluoride supported on a support such as an activated carbon.  In this catalyst, however, the active site is the alkali metal fluoride, and the activated carbon only plays a role as a support (Patent Document 1). Catalysts for coordinate anion-reactive monomers such as cyclic ethers and lactones include, for example, (C2H5)2Zn-H20, (C2H5)2Zn-ROH, and AlR3-acetylacetone-H20, wherein R represents an alkyl group; and those for metathesis reactive monomers such as cyclic olefins include Mods and WC16.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, when these known catalysts are used, 1) side reactions other than polymerization may occur, and/or 2) residual catalysts, if remained in the resulting polymers, may exhibit some toxicity or may cause deterioration in performance of the polymers.<br>
[0005]<br>
In contrast, activated carbons have been known to be used as adsorbents and supports for solid catalysts but have<br>
A<br>
not yet been known to be usable, if used alone, as catalysts for ring-opening polymerization.<br>
[0006]<br>

In the present invention, the term "ring-opening homopolymerization" refers to ring-opening polymerization of one cyclic compound (A), and the term "ring-opening copolymerization" refers to ring-opening polymerization of two or more different cyclic compounds (A).<br>
[0025]<br>
[Activated Carbon]<br>
Activated carbons for use as catalysts in the present invention can be articles known as porous carbonaceous absorbents.  These activated carbons can be prepared by<br><br>
carbonizing carbonaceous materials through heat treatment, and activating the carbonized materials.  Examples of such<br><br>

[0030]<br>
[Active Hydrogen-containing Compound]<br>
When a cyclic compound (A) for use in the present invention is one having active hydrogen, such as glycidol, ring-opening homopolymerization of glycidol or ring-opening copolymerization of glycidol with another cyclic compound (A) having no active hydrogen can be carried out using hydroxyl group of glycidol as an initiator.<br>
[0031]<br>
Ring-opening homopolymerization of a cyclic compound (A) and ring-opening copolymerization of a cyclic compound (A) with another cyclic compound (A) can also be carried out using an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) as an initiator.  The "active hydrogen-containing compound (b)" refers to, for example, a compound having one or more of hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, amino group and/or thiol group.<br>
[0032]<br><br>
Examples of such active hydrogen-containing compounds (b) include water; diols such as ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
4<br>
glycol, butanediol, neopentyl glycol, and hexanediol; ether diols as condensates of these; and trifunctional or higher polyhydroxy compounds such as glycerol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, and dipentaerythritol. Products from glycidol as the cyclic compound (A) and at least one of these compounds as the active hydrogen-containing compound (b) are herein referred to as polyglycidols.<br>
[0033]<br>
The active hydrogen-containing compounds (b) further include monohydroxy compounds.  Among them, aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic alcohols having one to thirty carbon atoms are preferred, of which aliphatic alcohols are more preferred.  More specific examples thereof include lower alcohols having one or more carbon atoms, and higher alcohols having ten or more carbon atoms.  Products from glycidol as a cyclic compound (A) and any of these compounds as an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) are corresponding alcohol esters of polyglycidols.  The use of an aliphatic alcohol, for example, as an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) yields a polyglycidol aliphatic alkyl ether.<br>
[0034]<br><br>
The active hydrogen-containing compounds (b) also include monocarboxy or polycarboxy compounds.  Specific<br>
t<br>
examples of such carboxy compounds include lower aliphatic carboxylic acids such as those ranging from formic acid, acetic acid to decanoic acid, polymerizable unsaturated carboxylic acids such as (meth)acrylic acids, and higher aliphatic carboxylic acids such as those ranging from lauric acid (dodecanoic acid) to stearic acid (octadecanoic acid); aliphatic saturated or polymerizable unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, succinic acid, and adipic acid; alicyclic dicarboxylic acids such as cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid; aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid and analogues thereof; tricarboxylic acids such as propanetricarboxylic acid, trimellitic acid, and aminotriacetic acid; tetracarboxylic acids such as butanetetracarboxylic acid, pyromellitic acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and other polycarboxylic acids.  Products from glycidol and any of these compounds, if used as a cyclic compound (A) and an active hydrogen-containing compound (b), respectively, are corresponding carboxylic acid esters of polyglycidols.  The use of an aliphatic carboxylic acid, for example, as an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) yields a polyglycidol aliphatic carboxylic acid ester. [0035]<br>
The reaction temperature and reaction time of ring-opening polymerization are not specifically limited.  The<br>
t<br>
ring-opening polymerization is carried out at temperatures of, for example, 100°C to 200°C preferably for one hour or longer and more preferably for five hours or longer. [0036]<br>
A reaction system in ring-opening polymerization contains a cyclic compound as a monomer and an activated carbon as essential components.  It may further contain, where necessary, one or more solvents as reaction diluents. Examples of such solvents (reaction diluents) include low molecular weight hydrocarbons such as aliphatic hydrocarbons having about four to about twelve carbon atoms; alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene; chain ethers such as those ranging from dimethyl ether to ethylene glycol dimethyl ether; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone; amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide; and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
[0037]<br>
A reaction may be carried out according to a batch mode, a semibatch mode, or a continuous mode.  Reactors for use herein include stirred tank reactors; flow reactors such as packed columns; and fluidized bed reactors.  The reaction is<br>
preferably carried out according to a procedure, in which an activated carbon as a catalyst is packed in a packed-column reactor to form a catalytic layer, and a cyclic compound (A) alone or a mixture of a cyclic 'compound (A) and an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) is allowed to pass through the catalytic layer.  This procedure not only saves the time and efforts for filtering the catalyst but also enables easy reactivation and drying of a deactivated catalyst by allowing steam to pass through the catalytic layer. EXAMPLES<br>

The catalyst can be easily separated and removed from a target product through filtration, and does not cause deterioration in safety and performance of the target product, in contrast to known catalysts.  A process according to the present invention is very excellent as a process for industrially producing ring-opened polymers of cyclic compounds.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for ring-opening polymerization that proceeds through ring opening of at least<br>
one cyclic compound (A) as a monomer, the process comprising the step of using an<br>
activated carbon as a catalyst, wherein the cyclic compound (A) is an oxirane compound<br>
(a) represented by following General Formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 maybe the same as or different from each other and each represent one selected from the group consisting of hydrogen (H); a branched- or straight-chain alkyl group having one to thirty carbon atoms or an aryl group; and a functional group represented by -CH2-M, wherein M represents OH, F, C Br, or -OR3 wherein R3 represents an alkyl group having one to twenty carbon atoms, alkyl group, or an aryl group.<br>
2.	The process for ring-opening polymerization as claimed in claim 1, wherein the activated carbon comprises a powdered activated carbon.<br>
3.	The process for ring-opening polymerization as claimed in claim 1 and 2, wherein the ring-opening polymerization is ring-opening homopolymerization of one cyclic compound (A) or ring-opening copolymerization of two or more different cyclic compounds (A).<br>
4.	The process for ring-opening polymerization as claimed in claim 1, wherein the oxirane compound (a) is at least one selected from the group consisting of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, an α-olefln epoxide having six to thirty carbon atoms, styrene oxide, glycidol, and epichlorohydrin.<br>
5.	The process for ring-opening polymerization according to claim 4, wherein the oxirano compound (a) is glycidol.<br><br>
6.	The process for ring-opening polymerization as claimed in claim 5, optionally comprising carrying out a reaction of glycidol using an active hydrogen-containing compound (b) as an initiator.<br>
7.	The process for ring-opening polymerization as claimed in claim 6, optionally comprising using water or a polyhydroxy compound as the active hydrogen-containing compound (b) to yield a polyglycidol.<br>
8.	The process for ring-opening polymerization as claimed in claim 6, optionally comprising using an aliphatic alcohol as the active hydrogen-containing compound (b) to yield a polyglycidol aliphatic alkyl ether.<br>
9.	The process for ring-opening polymerization as claimed in claim 6, optionally comprising using an aliphatic carboxylic acid as the active hydrogen-containing compound (b) to yield a polyglycidol aliphatic carboxylic acid ester.</td>
