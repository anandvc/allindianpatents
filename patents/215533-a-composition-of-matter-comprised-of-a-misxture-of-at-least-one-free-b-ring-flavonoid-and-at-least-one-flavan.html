FREE B RING FLAVONOID AND AT LEAST ONE FLAVAN"<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the prevention and treatment of diseases and<br>
conditions mediated by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)<br>
pathways. Specifically, the present invention relates to a novel composition of matter<br>
comprised of a mixture of a blend of two specific classes of compounds --Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids and flavans- for use in the prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions<br>
mediated by the COX-2 and 5-LO pathways. Included in the present invention is a method<br>
for the simultaneous inhibition of the protein function of the COX-2 and 5-LO enzymes,<br>
and a method for modulating the production of mRNA by administration of the novel<br>
composition of this invention. Also included in the present invention is a method for the<br>
prevention and treatment of COX-2 and 5-LO mediated diseases and conditions, including<br>
but not limited to joint discomfort and pain associated with conditions such as<br>
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other injuries that result from overuse. Further<br>
included in the present invention is a method for reducing blood glucose levels and<br>
promoting weight loss.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The liberation and metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) from the cell membrane<br>
results in the generation of pro-inflammatory metabolites by several different pathways.<br>
Arguably, two of the most important pathways to inflammation are mediated by the<br>
enzymes 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and cyclooxygenase (COX). These parallel pathways<br>
result in the generation of leukotrienes and prostaglandins, respectively, which play<br>
important roles in the initiation and progression of the inflammatory response. These<br>
vasoactive compounds are chemotaxins, which promote infiltration of inflammatory cells<br>
into tissues and serve to prolong the inflammatory response. Consequently, the enzymes<br>
responsible for generating these mediators of inflammation have become the targets for<br>
many new drugs aimed at the treatment of inflammation that contributes to the<br>
pathogenesis of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer"s disease<br>
and certain types of cancer.<br>
Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme is the mechanism of action<br>
attributed to most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAJDS). There are two distinct<br>
isoforms of the COX enzyme (COX-1 and COX-2) that share approximately 60%<br>
sequence homology, but differ in expression profiles and function. COX-1 is a<br>
constitutive form of the enzyme that has been linked to the production of physiologically<br>
important prostaglandins involved in the regulation of normal physiological functions such<br>
as platelet aggregation, protection of cell function in the stomach and maintenance of<br>
normal kidney function (Dannhardt and Kiefer (2001) Eur. J. Med. Chem. 36:109-26).<br>
The second isoform, COX-2, is a form of the enzyme that is inducible by pro-<br>
inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and other growth factors<br>
(Herschmann (1994) Cancer Metastasis Rev. 134:241-56; Xie et al. (1992) Drugs Dev.<br>
Res. 25:249-65). This isoform catalyzes the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from<br>
AA. Inhibition of COX-2 is responsible for the anti-inflammatory activities of<br>
conventional NSAIDs.<br>
Inhibitors that demonstrate dual specificity for COX-2 and 5-LO, while<br>
maintaining COX-2 selectivity relative to COX-1, would have the obvious benefit of<br>
inhibiting multiple pathways of AA metabolism. Such inhibitors would block the<br>
inflammatory effects of PGE2, as well as, those of multiple leukotrienes (LT) by limiting<br>
their production. This includes the vasodilation, vasopermeability and chemotactic effects<br>
of LTB4 and LTD4 and the effects of LTE4, also known as the slow reacting substance of<br>
anaphalaxis. Of these, LTB4 has the most potent chemotactic and chemokinetic effects<br>
(Moore (1985) in Prostanoids: Pharmacological. Physiological and Clinical Relevance.<br>
Cambridge University Press, N.Y., pp. 229-30) and has been shown to be elevated in the<br>
gastrointestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Sharon and Stenson<br>
(1983) Gastroenterology 84:1306-13) and within the synovial fluid of patients with<br>
rheumatoid arthritis (Klicksein et al. (1980) J. Clin. Invest. 66:1166-70; Rae et al. (1982)<br>
Lancet ii: 1122-4).<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned benefits of dual COX-2/5-LO inhibitors, many<br>
dual inhibitors do not cause some of the side effects that are typical of NSAIDs or COX-2<br>
inhibitors, including the gastrointestinal damage and discomfort caused by traditional<br>
NSAEDs. It has been suggested that NSAID-induced gastric inflammation is largely due to<br>
metabolites of 5-LO, particularly LTB4, which attracts cells to the site of a gastric lesion<br>
thus causing further damage (Kircher et al. (1997) Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty<br>
Acids 56:417-23). Leukotrienes represent the primary AA metabolites within the gastric<br>
mucosa following prostanoid inhibition. It appears that these compounds contribute to a<br>
significant amount of the gastric epithelial injury resulting from the use of NSAIDs.<br>
(Celotti and Laufer (2001) Pharmacol. Res. 43:429-36). Dual inhibitors of COX-2 and 5-<br>
LO were also demonstrated to inhibit the coronary vasoconstriction in arthritic hearts in a<br>
rat model (Gok et al. (2000) Pharmacology 60:41-46). Taken together, these<br>
characteristics suggest that there may be distinct advantages to dual inhibitors of COX-2<br>
and 5-LO over specific COX-2 inhibitors and non-specific NSAIDs with regard to both<br>
increased efficacy and reduced side effects.<br>
Because the mechanism of action of COX inhibitors overlaps that of most<br>
conventional NSAIDs, COX inhibitors are used to treat many of the same symptoms, such<br>
as the pain and swelling associated with inflammation in transient conditions and chronic<br>
diseases in which inflammation plays a critical role. Transient conditions include the<br>
treatment of inflammation associated with minor abrasions, sunburn or contact dermatitis,<br>
as well as, the relief of pain associated with tension and migraine headaches and menstrual<br>
cramps. Chronic conditions include arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and<br>
osteoarthritis. Although rheumatoid arthritis is largely an autoimmune disease and<br>
osteoarthritis is caused by the degradation of cartilage in joints, reducing the inflammation<br>
associated with each provides a significant increase in the quality of life for those suffering<br>
from these diseases (Wienberg (2001) Immunol. Res. 22:319-41; Wollhiem (2000) Curr.<br>
Opin. Rheum. 13: 193-201). As inflammation is a component of rheumatic diseases in<br>
general, the use of COX inhibitors has been expanded to include diseases such as systemic<br>
lupus erythromatosus (SLE) (Goebel et al. (1999) Chem. Res. Tox. 12:488-500; Patrono et<br>
al. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 76:1011-1018) and rheumatic skin conditions such as<br>
scleroderma. COX inhibitors are also used for the relief of inflammatory skin conditions<br>
that are not of rheumatic origin, such as psoriasis, in which reducing the inflammation<br>
resulting from the over production of prostaglandins could provide a direct benefit (Fogh<br>
etal. (1993) Acta Derm. Venereol (Oslo) 73:191-3).<br>
In addition to their use as anti-inflammatory agents, another potential role for COX<br>
inhibitors is the treatment of cancer. Over-expression of COX-2 has been demonstrated in<br>
various human malignancies and inhibitors of COX-2 have been shown to be efficacious<br>
in the treatment of animals with skin, breast and bladder tumors. While the mechanism of<br>
action is not completely understood, the over-expression of COX-2 has been shown to<br>
inhibit apoptosis and increase the invasiveness of tumorgenic cell types (Dempke et al.<br>
(2001) J. Can. Res. Clin. Oncol. 127:411-17; Moore and Simmons (2000) Current Med.<br>
Chem. 7:1131-44). It is possible that enhanced production of prostaglandins, resulting<br>
from the over-expression of COX-2, promotes cellular proliferation and consequently<br>
increases angiogenesis. (Moore (1985) in Prostanoids: Pharmacological, Physiological<br>
and Clinical Relevance. Cambridge University Press, N.Y., pp. 229-30; Fenton et al.<br>
(2001) Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 24:453-57).<br>
There have been a number of clinical studies evaluating COX-2 inhibitors for<br>
potential use in the prevention and treatment of different types of cancer. In 1999, 130,000<br>
new cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed in the United States. Aspirin, a non-<br>
specific NSAID, has been found to reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer by 40-50%<br>
(Giovannucci et al. (1995) N. Engl. J. Med. 333:609-614) and mortality by 50% (Smalley<br>
et al (1999) Arch. Intern. Med. 159:161-166). In 1999, the FDA approved the COX-2<br>
inhibitor celecoxib for use in FAP (Familial Ademonatous Polyposis) to reduce colorectal<br>
cancer mortality. It is believed that other cancers with evidence of COX-2 involvement<br>
may be successfully prevented and/or treated with COX-2 inhibitors including, but not<br>
limited to, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, cervical<br>
cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (Jaeckel<br>
et al. (2001) Arch. Otolarnygol. 127:1253-59; Kirschenbaum et al. (2001) Urology<br>
58:127-31; Dannhardt and Kiefer (2001) Eur. J. Med. Chem. 36:109-26). COX-2<br>
inhibitors may also prove successful in preventing colon cancer in high-risk patients.<br>
There is also evidence that COX-2 inhibitors can prevent or even reverse several types of<br>
life-threatening cancers. To date, as many as fifty studies show that COX-2 inhibitors can<br>
prevent pre-malignant and malignant tumors in animals, and possibly prevent bladder,<br>
esophageal and skin cancers as well. COX-2 inhibition could prove to be one of the most<br>
important preventive medical accomplishments of the century.<br>
Recent scientific progress has identified correlations between COX-2 expression,<br>
general inflammation and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer"s Disease (AD) (Ho et al. (2001)<br>
Arch. Neurol. 58:487-92). In animal models, transgenic mice that over-express the COX-2<br>
enzyme have neurons that are more susceptible to damage. The National Institute on<br>
Aging (NIA) is launching a clinical trial to determine whether NSAIDs can slow the<br>
progression of Alzheimer"s disease. Naproxen (a non-selective NSAID) and rofecoxib<br>
(Vioxx, a COX-2 specific selective NSAID) will be evaluated. Previous evidence has<br>
indicated that inflammation contributes to Alzheimer"s disease. According to the<br>
Alzheimer"s Association and the NLA, about 4 million people suffer from AD in the United<br>
States and this is expected to increase to 14 million by mid-century.<br>
The COX enzyme (also known as prostaglandin H2 synthase) catalyzes two<br>
separate reactions. In the first reaction, AA is metabolized to form the unstable<br>
prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), a cyclooxygenase reaction. In the second reaction, PGG2 is<br>
converted to the endoperoxide PGH2, a peroxidase reaction. The short-lived PGH2 non-<br>
enzymatically degrades to PGE2. The compounds described herein are the result of a<br>
discovery strategy that combined an assay focused on the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2<br>
peroxidase activity with a chemical dereplication process to identify novel inhibitors of the<br>
COX enzymes.<br>
The term gene expression is often used to describe the broad result of mRNA<br>
production and protein synthesis. In fact, changes in actual gene expression may never<br>
result in observable changes on the protein level. The corollary, that changes in protein<br>
level do not always result from changes in gene expression, can also be true. There are six<br>
possible points of regulation in the pathway leading from genomic DNA to a functional<br>
protein: (1) transcriptional regulation by nuclear factors and other signals leading to<br>
production of pre-mRNA; (2) pre-mRNA processing regulation involving exon splicing,<br>
the additions of a 5" cap structure and 3" poly-adenylation sequence and transport of the<br>
mature mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm; (3) mRNA transport regulation<br>
controlling localization of the mRNA to a specific cytoplasmic site for translation into<br>
protein; (4) mRNA degradation regulation controlling the size of the mRNA pool either<br>
prior to any protein translation or as a means of ending translation from that specific<br>
mRNA; (5) translational regulation of the specific rate of protein translation initiation and<br>
(6) post-translation processing regulation involving modifications such as glycosylation<br>
and proteolytic cleavage. In the context of genomics research it is important to use<br>
techniques that measure gene expression levels closer to the initial steps (e.g. mRNA<br>
levels) rather than later steps (e.g. protein levels) in this pathway.<br>
Recent reports have addressed the possible involvement of flavonoids, isolated<br>
from the medicinal herb Scutellaria baicalensis, in alterations in cox-2 gene expression<br>
(Wakabayashi and Yasui (2000) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 406:477-481; Chen et al. (2001)<br>
Biochem. Pharmacol. 61:1417-1427; Chi et al. (2001) 61:1195-1203 and Raso et al.<br>
(2001) Life Sci. 68:921-931). Each of above cited studies on cox-2 gene expression used a<br>
Western Blot technique to evaluate putative alterations in gene expression without<br>
validation on the molecular level. Since this method only measures protein levels and not<br>
the specific transcription product, mRNA, it is possible that other mechanisms are<br>
involved leading to the observed increase in protein expression. For example, LPS has<br>
been reported to modulate mRNA half-lives via instability sequences found in the 3"<br>
untranslated region (3"UTR) of mRNAs (Watkins et al. (1999) Life Sci. 65:449-481),<br>
which could account for increased protein expression without alternations in the rate of<br>
gene transcription. Consequently, this leaves open the question of whether or not these<br>
treatment conditions resulted in a meaningful change in gene expression.<br>
Techniques, such as RT-qPCR and DNA microarray analysis, rely on mRNA levels<br>
for analysis and can be used to evaluate levels of gene expression under different<br>
conditions, i.e. in the presence or absence of a pharmaceutical agent. There are no known<br>
reports using techniques that specifically measure the amount of mRNA, directly or<br>
indirectly, in the literature when Free-B-ring flavonoids or flavans are used as the<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
Flavonoids are a widely distributed group of natural products. The intake of<br>
flavonoids has been demonstrated to be inversely related to the risk of incident dementia.<br>
The mechanism of action, while not known, has been speculated as being due to the anti-<br>
oxidative effects of flavonoids (Commenges et al (2000) Eur. J. Epidemiol. 16:357-363).<br>
Polyphenol flavones induce programmed cell death, differentiation and growth inhibition<br>
in transformed colonocytes by acting at the mRNA level on genes including cox-2,<br>
Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFkB) and bcl-X(L) (Wenzel et al. (2000) Cancer Res. 60:3823-<br>
3831). It has been reported that the number of hydroxyl groups on the B ring is important<br>
in the suppression of cox-2 transcriptional activity (Mutoh et al. (2000) Jnp. J. Cancer Res.<br>
91:686-691).<br>
Free-B-ring flavones and flavonols are a specific class of flavonoids, which have<br>
no substituent groups on the aromatic B ring (referred to herein as Free-B-ring flavonoids),<br>
as illustrated by the following general structure:<br>
wherein <br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of-H,<br>
-OH, -SH, OR, -SR, -NH2, -NHR, -KR2, -NR3+X-, a carbon, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur,<br>
glycoside of a single or a combination of multiple sugars including, but not limited to<br>
aldopentoses, methyl-aldopentose, aldohexoses, ketohexose and their chemical derivatives<br>
thereof;<br>
wherein<br>
R is an alkyl group having between 1-10 carbon atoms; and<br>
X is selected from the group of pharmaceutically acceptable counter anions<br>
including, but not limited to hydroxyl, chloride, iodide, sulfate, phosphate, acetate,<br>
fluoride, carbonate, etc.<br>
Free-B-ring flavonoids are relatively rare. Out of 9,396 flavonoids synthesized or<br>
isolated from natural sources, only 231 Free-B-ring flavonoids are known (The Combined<br>
Chemical Dictionary, Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, Version 5:1 June 2001). Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids have been reported to have diverse biological activity. For example, galangin<br>
(3,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) acts as an anti-oxidant and free radicalscavenger and is believed<br>
to be a promising candidate for anti-genotoxicity and cancer chemoprevention. (Heo et al.<br>
(2001) Mutat. Res. 488:135-150). It is an inhibitor of tyrosinase monophenolase (Kubo et<br>
al. (2000) Bioorg. Med. Chem. 8:1749-1755), an inhibitor of rabbit heart carbonyl<br>
reductase (Imamura et al. (2000) J. Biochem. 127:653-658), has antimicrobial activity<br>
(Afolayan and Meyer (1997) Ethnopharmacol. 57:177-181) and antiviral activity (Meyer et<br>
al. (1997) J. Ethnopharmacol. 56:165-169). Baicalein and two other Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids, have antiproliferative activity against human breast cancer cells. (So et al.<br>
(1997) Cancer Lett. 112:127-1331<br>
Typically, flavonoids have been tested for activity randomly based upon their<br>
availability. Occasionally, the requirement of substitution on the B-ring has been<br>
emphasized for specific biological activity, such as the B-ring substitution required for<br>
high affinity binding to p-glycoprotein (Boumendjel et al. (2001) Bioorg. Med. Chem.<br>
Lett. 11:75-77); cardiotonic effect (Itoigawa et al. (1999) J. Ethnopharmacol. 65: 267-<br>
272), protective effect on endothelial cells against linoleic acid hydroperoxide-induced<br>
toxicity (Kaneko and Baba (1999) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 63:323-328), COX-1<br>
inhibitory activity (Wang (2000) Phytomedicine 7:15-19) and prostaglandin endoperoxide<br>
synthase activity (Kalkbrenner et al. (1992) Pharmacology 44:1-12). Only a few-<br>
publications have mentioned the significance of the unsubstituted B-ring of the Free-B-<br>
ring flavonoids. One example is the use of 2-phenyl flavones, which inhibit NADPH<br>
quinone acceptor oxidoreductase, as potential anticoagulants (Chen et al. (2001) Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol. 61:1417-1427).<br>
The reported mechanism of action with respect to the anti-inflammatory activity of<br>
various Free-B-ring flavonoids has been controversial. The anti-inflammatory activity of<br>
the Free-B-ring flavonoids, chrysin (Liang et al. (2001) FEBS Lett. 496:12-18), wogonin<br>
(Chi et al. (2001) Biochem. Pharmacol. 61:1195-1203) and halangin (Raso et al. (2001)<br>
Life Sci. 68:921-931) has been associated with the suppression of inducible<br>
cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase via activation of peroxisome-proliferator<br>
activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) and influence on degranulation and AA release<br>
(Tordera et al. (1994) Z. Naturforsch [C] 49:235-240). It has been reported that oroxylin,<br>
baicalein and wogonin inhibit 12-lipoxygenase activity without affecting cyclooxygenases<br>
(You et al. (1999) Arch. Pharm. Res. 22:18-24). More recently, the anti-inflammatory<br>
activity of wogonin, baicalin and baicalein has been reported as occurring through<br>
inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cox~2 enzyme production induced by<br>
nitric oxide inhibitors and lipopolysaccharides (Chen et al. (2001) Biochem. Pharmacol.<br>
61:1417-1427). It has also been reported that oroxylin acts via suppression of NF?B<br>
activation (Chen et al. (2001) Biochem. Pharmacol. 61:1417-1427). Finally, wogonin<br>
reportedly inhibits inducible PGE2 production in macrophages (Wakabayashi and Yasui<br>
(2000) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 406:477-481).<br>
Inhibition of the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and<br>
inhibition of Ca2+ ionophore A23187 induced PGE2 release by baicalein has been reported<br>
as the mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of Scutellariae radix (Nakahata et al.<br>
(1999) Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi 114, Supp. 11:215P-219P; Nakahata et al. (1998) Am. J.<br>
Chin. Med. 26:311-323). Baicalin from Scutellaria baicalensis reportedly inhibits<br>
superantigenic staphylococcal exotoxins stimulated T-cell proliferation and production of<br>
IL-1ß, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and interferon-y (IFN-?) (Krakauer et al.<br>
(2001) FEBS Lett. 500:52-55). Thus, the anti-inflammatory activity of baicalin has been<br>
associated with inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines mediated signaling pathways<br>
activated by superantigens. However, it has also been proposed that the anti-inflammatory<br>
activity of baicalin is due to the binding of a variety of chemokines, which limit their<br>
biological activity (Li et al. (2000) Immunopharmacol. 49:295-306). Recently, the effects<br>
of baicalin on adhesion molecule expression induced by thrombin and thrombin receptor<br>
agonist peptide (Kimura et al. (2001) Planta Med. 62:331-334), as well as, the inhibition<br>
of MAPK cascade (Nakahata et al. (1999) Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi 114, Supp 11:215P-<br>
219P; Nakahata et al. (1998) Am. J. Chin Med. 26:311-323) have been reported.<br>
The Chinese medicinal plant Scutellaria baicalensis contains significant amounts<br>
of Free-B-ring flavonoids, including baicalein, baicalin, wogonin and baicalenoside.<br>
Traditionally, this plant has been used to treat a number of conditions including clearing<br>
away heat, purging fire, dampness-warm and summer fever syndromes; polydipsia<br>
resulting from high fever; carbuncle, sores and other pyogenic skin infections; upper<br>
respiratory infections such as acute tonsillitis, laryngopharyngitis and scarlet fever; viral<br>
hepatitis; nephritis; pelvitis; dysentery; hematemesis and epistaxis. This plant has also<br>
traditionally been used to prevent miscarriage (see Encyclopedia of Chinese Traditional<br>
Medicine. ShangHai Science and Technology Press, ShangHai, China, 1998). Clinically,<br>
Scutellaria is now used to treat conditions such as pediatric pneumonia, pediatric bacterial<br>
diarrhea, viral hepatitis, acute gallbladder inflammation, hypertension, topical acute<br>
inflammation resulting from cuts and surgery, bronchial asthma and upper respiratory<br>
infections (Encyclopedia of Chinese Traditional Medicine. ShangHai Science and<br>
Technology Press, ShangHai, China, 1998). The pharmacological efficacy of Scutellaria<br>
roots for treating bronchial asthma is reportedly related to the presence of Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids and their suppression of eotaxin associated recruitment of eosinophils<br>
(Nakajima et al. (2001) Planta Med. 67(2): 132-135).<br>
To date, a number of naturally occurring Free-B-ring flavonoids have been<br>
commercialized for varying uses. For example, liposome formulations of Scutellaria<br>
extracts have been utilized for skin care (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,643,598; 5,443,983). Baicalin<br>
has been used for preventing cancer due to its inhibitory effects on oncogenes (U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 6,290,995). Baicalin and other compounds have been used as antiviral, antibacterial<br>
and immunomodulating agents (U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,921) and as natural anti-oxidants<br>
(Poland Pub. No. 9,849,256). Chrysin has been used for its anxiety reducing properties<br>
(U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,538). Anti-inflammatory flavonoids are used for the control and<br>
treatment of anorectal and colonic diseases (U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,371) and inhibition of<br>
lipoxygenase (U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,875). These compounds are also formulated with<br>
glucosamine collagen and other ingredients for repair and maintenance of connective<br>
tissue (U.S. Pat. No. 6,333,304). Flavonoid esters constitute the active ingredients for<br>
cosmetic compositions (U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,294). U.S. Application Serial No. 10/091,362,<br>
filed March 1, 2002, entitled "Identification of Free-B-ring Flavonoids as Potent COX-2<br>
Inhibitors," discloses a method for inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme COX-2 by<br>
administering a composition comprising a Free-B-ring flavonoid or a composition<br>
containing a mixture of Free-B-ring flavonoids to a host in need thereof. This is the first<br>
report of a link between Free-B-ring flavonoids and COX-2 inhibitory activity. This<br>
application is specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Japanese Pat. No. 63027435, describes the extraction, and enrichment of baicalein<br>
and Japanese Pat. No. 61050921 describes the purification of baicalin.<br>
Flavans include compounds illustrated by the following general structure:<br>
wherein<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -<br>
OH, -SH, -OCH3, -SCH3, -OR, -SR, -NH2, -NRH, -NR2, -NR3+X- esters of the mentioned<br>
substitution groups, including, but not limited to, gallate, acetate, cinnamoyl and hydroxyl-<br>
cinnamoyl esters, trihydroxybenzoyl esters and caffeoyl esters, and their chemical<br>
derivatives thereof; a carbon, oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur glycoside of a single or a<br>
combination of multiple sugars including, but not limited to, aldopentoses, methyl<br>
aldopentose, aldohexoses, ketohexose and their chemical derivatives thereof; dimer, trimer<br>
and other polymerized flavans;<br>
wherein<br>
R is an alkyl group having between 1-10 carbon atoms; and<br>
X is selected from the group of pharmaceutically acceptable counter anions<br>
including, but not limited to hydroxyl, chloride, iodide, sulfate, phosphate, acetate,<br>
fluoride, and carbonate, etc.<br>
Catechin is a flavan, found primarily in Acacia, having the following structure<br>
Catechin works both alone and in conjunction with other flavonoids found in tea, and has<br>
both antiviral and antioxidant activity. Catechin has been shown to be effective in the<br>
treatment of viral hepatitis. It also appears to prevent oxidative damage to the heart,<br>
kidney, lungs and spleen and has been shown to inhibit the growth of stomach cancer cells.<br>
Catechin and its isomer epicatechin inhibit prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase<br>
with an IC50 value of 40 µM. (Kalkbrenner et al. (1992) Pharmacol. 44:1-12). Five<br>
flavan-3-ol derivatives, including (+)-catechin and gallocatechin, isolated from the four<br>
plant species, Atuna racemosa, Syzygium carynocarpum, Syzygium malaccense and<br>
Vantanea peruviana, exhibit equal to or weaker inhibitory activity against COX-2, relative<br>
to COX-1, with IC50 values ranging from 3.3 µM to 138 µM (Noreen et al. (1998) Planta<br>
Med. 64:520-524). (+)-Catechin, isolated from the bark of Ceiba pentandra, inhibits<br>
COX-1 with an IC50 value of 80 µM (Noreen et al. (1998) J. Nat. Prod. 61:8-12).<br>
Commercially available pure (+)-catechin inhibits COX-1 with an IC50 value of around<br>
183 to 279 µM, depending upon the experimental conditions, with no selectivity for COX-<br>
2 (Noreen et al. (1998) J. Nat. Prod. 61:1-7).<br>
Green tea catechin, when supplemented into the diets of Sprague dawley male rats,<br>
lowered the activity level of platelet PLA2 and significantly reduced platelet<br>
cyclooxygenase levels (Yang et al. (1999) J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 45:337-346). Catechin<br>
and epicatechin reportedly weakly suppress cox-2 gene transcription in human colon<br>
cancer DUD-1 cells (IC50 = 415.3 jjM) (Mutoh et al. (2000) Jpn. J. Cancer Res. £1:686-<br>
691). The neuroprotective ability of (+)-catechin from red wine results from the<br>
antioxidant properties of catechin, rather than inhibitory effects on intracellular enzymes,<br>
such as cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase or nitric oxide synthase (Bastianetto et al. (2000)<br>
Br. J. Pharmacol. 131:711-720). Catechin derivatives purified from green tea and black<br>
tea, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-<br>
gallate (ECG) and theaflavins showed inhibition of cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-<br>
dependent metabolism of AA in human colon mucosa and colon tumor tissues (Hong et al.<br>
(2001) Biochem. Pharmacol. 62:1175-1183) and induced cox-2 gene expression and PGE2<br>
production (Park et al. (2001) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 286:721-725).<br>
Epiafzelechin isolated from the aerial parts of Celastrus orbiculatus exhibited dose-<br>
dependent inhibition of COX-1 activity with an IC50 value of 15 µM and also<br>
demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenin-induced mouse paw edema<br>
following oral administration at a dosage of 100 mg/kg (Min et al. (1999) Planta Med.<br>
65:460-462).<br>
Catechin and its derivatives from various plant sources, especially from green tea<br>
leaves, have been used in the treatment of HPV infected Condyloma acuminata (Cheng,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,911) and in the treatment of hyperplasia caused by papilloma virus<br>
(Cheng, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,968,973 and 6,197,808). Catechin and its derivatives have also<br>
been used topically to inhibit angiogenesis in mammalian tissue, in conditions such as skin<br>
cancer, psoriasis, spider veins or under eye circles (Anderson, U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,341),<br>
against UVB-induced tumorigenesis in mice (Agarwal et al. (1993) Photochem. Photobiol.<br>
58:695-700), for inhibiting nitric oxide synthase at the level of gene expression and<br>
enzyme activity (Chan, U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,756), and as hair-growing agents (Takahashi,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,940). Catechin-based compositions have also been formulated with<br>
other extracts and vitamins for treatment of acne (Murad, U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,517),<br>
hardening the tissue of digestive organs (Shi, U.S. Pat. No. 5,470, 589) and for inhibiting 5<br>
alpha-reductase activity in treating androgenic disorder related diseases and cancers (Liao,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,929). Green tea extract has been formulated with seven other plant<br>
extracts for reducing inflammation by inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme, without identification<br>
of any of the specific active components (Mewmark, U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,995).<br>
Acacia is a genus of leguminous trees and shrubs. The genus Acacia includes more<br>
than 1,000 species belonging to the family of Leguminosae and the subfamily of<br>
Mimosoideae. Acacias are distributed worldwide in places such as tropical and<br>
subtropical areas of Central and South America, Africa, parts of Asia, as well as, Australia,<br>
which has the largest number of endemic species. Acacias axe present primarily in dry and<br>
arid regions where the forests are often in the nature of open thorny shrubs. The genus<br>
Acacia is divided into 3 subgenera based mainly on leaf morphology —Acacia, Aculiferum<br>
and Heterophyllum. Based on the nature of the leaves of mature trees, however, the genus<br>
Acacia can be divided into two "popular" groups —the typical bipinnate-leaved species and<br>
the phyllodenous species. A phyllode is a modified petiole expanded into a leaf-like<br>
structure with no leaflets, an adaptation to xerophytic conditions. The typical bipinnate-<br>
leaved species are found primarily throughout the tropics, whereas the phyllodenous<br>
species occur mainly in Australia. More than 40 species of Acacia have been reported in<br>
India. Gamble in his book entitled Flora of Madras Presidency listed 23 native species for<br>
southern India, 15 of which are found in Tamil Nadu. Since that time, however, many new<br>
Acacia species have been introduced to India and approximately 40 species are now found<br>
in Tamil Nadu itself. The indigenous species are primarily thorny trees or shrubs and a<br>
few are thorny stragglers, such as A. caesia, A. pennata and A. sinuata. Many species have<br>
been introduced from Africa and Australia, including A. mearnsii, A. picnantha and A.<br>
dealbata, which have bipinnate leaves and A. auriculiformis, A. holoserecia and A.<br>
mangium, which are phyllodenous species.<br>
Acacias are very important economically, providing a source of tannins, gums,<br>
timber, fuel and fodder. Tannins, which are isolated primarily from the bark, are used<br>
extensively for tanning hides and skins. Some Acacia barks are also used for flavoring<br>
local spirits. Some indigenous species like A. sinuata also yield saponins, which are any<br>
of various plant glucosides that form soapy lathers when mixed and agitated with water.<br>
Saponins are used in detergents, foaming agents and emulsifiers. The flowers of some<br>
Acacia species are fragrant and used to make perfume. For example, cassie perfume is<br>
obtained from A. ferrugenea. The heartwood of many Acacias is used for making<br>
agricultural implements and also provides a source of firewood. Acacia gums find<br>
extensive use in medicine and confectionary and as sizing and finishing materials in the<br>
textile industry. Lac insects can be grown on several species, including A. nilotica and A.<br>
catechu. Some species have been used for forestation of wastelands, including A. nilotica,<br>
which can withstand some water inundation and a few such areas have become bird<br>
sanctuaries.<br>
To date, approximately 330 compounds have been isolated from various Acacia<br>
species. Flavonoids, a type of water-soluble plant pigments, are the major class of<br>
compounds isolated from Acacias. Approximately 180 different flavonoids have been<br>
identified, 111 of which are flavans. Terpenoids are second largest class of compounds<br>
isolated from species of the Acacia genus, with 48 compounds having been identified.<br>
Other classes of compounds isolated from Acacia include, alkaloids (28), amino<br>
acids/peptides (20), tannins (16), carbohydrates (15), oxygen heterocycles (15) and<br>
aliphatic compounds (10). (Buckingham, in The Combined Chemical Dictionary.<br>
Chapman &amp; Hall CRC, version 5:2, Dec. 2001).<br>
Phenolic compounds, particularly flavans are found in moderate to high<br>
concentrations in all Acacia species (Abdulrazak et al. (2000) J. Anim. Sci..13:935-940).<br>
Historically, most of the plants and extracts of the Acacia genus have been utilized as<br>
astringents to treat gastrointestinal disorders, diarrhea, indigestion and to stop bleeding<br>
(Vautrin (1996) Universite Bourgogne (France) European abstract 58-01C:177; Saleem et<br>
al. (1998) Hamdard Midicus. 41:63-67). The bark and pods of A. arabica Willd. contain<br>
large quantities of tannins and have been utilized as astringents and expectorants<br>
(Nadkarni (1996) India Materia Medica, Bombay Popular Prakashan, pp. 9-17).<br>
Diarylpropanol derivatives, isolated from stem bark of A. tortilis from Somalia, have been<br>
reported to have smooth muscle relaxing effects (Hagos et al. (1987) Planta Med. 53:27-<br>
31,1987). It has also been reported that terpenoid saponins isolated from A. victoriae have<br>
an inhibitory effect on dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced murine skin carcinogenesis<br>
(Hanausek et al. (2000) Proc. Am. Assoc. Can. Res. Annu. Mtg. 41:663) and induce<br>
apoptosis (Haridas et al. (2000) Proc. Am. Assoc. for Can. Res. Annu. Mtg. 41:600).<br>
Plant extracts from A. nilotica have been reported to have spasmogenic, vasoconstrictor<br>
and anti-hypertensive activity (Amos et al. (1999) Phytotherapy Research 13:683-685;<br>
Gilani et al. (1999) Phytotherapy Research 11:665-669), and antiplatelet aggregatory<br>
activity (Shah et al. (1997) Gen. Pharmacol. 29:251-255). Anti-inflammatory activity has<br>
been reported for A. nilotica. It was speculated that flavonoids, polysaccharides and<br>
organic acids were potential active components (Dafallah and A1-Mustafa (1996) Am. J.<br>
Chin. Med. 24:263-269). To date, the only reported 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor isolated from<br>
Acacia is a monoterpenoidal carboxamide (Seikine et al. (1997) Chem. Pharm. Bull.<br>
(Tokyo) 45:148-11).<br>
Acacia gums have been formulated with other plant ingredients and used for ulcer<br>
prevention without identification of any of the active components (Fuisz, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,651,987). Acacia gums have also been formulated with other plant ingredients and used<br>
to improve drug dissolution (Blank, U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,684), by lowering the viscosity of<br>
nutritional compositions (Chancellor, U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,411).<br>
The extract from the bark of Acacia was patented in Japan for external use as a<br>
whitening agent (Abe, JP10025238), as a glucosyl transferase inhibitor for dental<br>
applications (Abe, JP07242555), as a protein synthesis inhibitor (Fukai, JP 07165598), as<br>
an active oxygen-scavenging agent for external skin preparations (Honda, JP 07017847,<br>
Bindra U.S. Pat. No. 6,1266,950), and as a hyaluronidase inhibitor for oral consumption to<br>
prevent inflammation, pollinosis and cough (Ogura, JP 07010768).<br>
Review of the literature has revealed no human clinical applications using mixtures<br>
of Free-B-ring flavonoids and flavans for relief of pain or measuring biochemical clinical<br>
outcomes for osteoarthritis treatment. This report appears to be the first randomized,<br>
double blind, placebo controlled study of the safety and efficacy of these compounds in<br>
humans.<br>

need thereof an effective amount of a composition comprising a mixture of Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids and flavans synthesized and/or isolated from a single plant or multiple plants<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. While not limited by theory, Applicant believes<br>
that the ability to modulate the production of mRNA is accomplished via a decrease, by<br>
the active ingredients in the Free-B-ring/flavan composition, in the production of mRNA<br>
by the cox-2 gene, but not the cox-1 gene. The ratio of Free-B-ring flavonoids to flavans<br>
in the composition can be in the range of 99:1 to 1:99 Free-B-ring flavonoids:flavans. In<br>
specific embodiments of the present invention, the ratio of Free-B-ring flavonoids to<br>
flavans is selected from the group consisting of approximately 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40,<br>
50:50, 40:60, 30:70, 20:80 and 10:90. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
ratio of Free-B-ring flavonoids: flavans in the composition of matter is approximately<br>
85:15. In a preferred embodiment the Free-B-ring flavonoids are isolated from a plant or<br>
plants in the Scutellaria genus of plants and flavans are isolated from a plant or plants in<br>
the Acacia genus of plants.<br>

10/104,477, filed March 22, 2002, entitled "Isolation of a Dual COX-2 and 5-<br>
Lipoxygenase Inhibitor from Acacia," which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
The present invention implements a strategy that combines a series of in vivo<br>
studies as well as in vitro biochemical, cellular, and gene expression screens to identify<br>
active plant extracts and components that specifically inhibit COX-2 and 5-LO enzymatic<br>
activity, and impact cox-2, but not cox-1 mRNA production. The methods used herein to<br>
identify active plant extracts and components that specifically inhibit COX-2 and 5-LO<br>
pathways are described in Examples 1 to 13 (Figures 1-10). These methods are described<br>
in greater detail in U.S. Application Serial No. 10/091,362, filed March 1, 2002, entitled<br>
"Identification of Free-B-ring Flavonoids as Potent COX-2 Inhibitors" and U.S.<br>
Application Serial No. 10/104,477, filed March 22, 2002, entitled "Isolation of a Dual<br>
COX-2 and 5-Lipoxygenase Inhibitor from Acacia," each of which is specifically<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
These studies resulted in the discovery of a novel composition of matter referred to<br>
herein as Univestin™, which is comprised of a proprietary blending of two standardized<br>
extracts, which contain Free-B-ring flavonoids and flavans, respectively. A general<br>
example for preparing such a composition is provided in Example 14 using two<br>
standardized extracts isolated from Acacia and Scutellaria, respectively, together with one<br>
or more excipients. The Acacia extract used in Example 14 contained &gt;60% total flavans,<br>
as catechin and epicatechin, and the Scutellaria extract contained &gt;70% Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids, which was primarily baicalin. The Scutellaria extract contained other minor<br>
amounts of Free-B-ring flavonoids as set forth in Table 11. One or more excipients are<br>
optionally added to the composition of matter. The amount of excipient added can be<br>
adjusted based on the actual active content of each ingredient desired. A blending table for<br>
each individual batch of product must be generated based on the product specification and<br>
QC results for individual batch of ingredients. Additional amounts of active ingredients in<br>
the range of 2-5% are recommended to meet the product specification. Example 14<br>
illustrates a blending table that was generated for one batch of Univestin™ (Lot#G1702-<br>
COX-2). Different blending ratios of the formulated Univestin™ product were tested for<br>
their ability to inhibit COX-2 and 5-LO enzyme activities, and to reduce cox mRNA<br>
production as described in Examples 15-17.<br>
The COX-2 inhibition assay relied on the activity of the enzyme peroxidase in the<br>
presence of heme and arachidonic acid. In order to screen for compounds that inhibited<br>
COX-1 and COX-2 activity, a high throughput, in vitro assay was developed that utilized<br>
inhibition of the peroxidase activity of both enzymes as illustrated in Examples 2 and 6.<br>
After isolating plant fractions that inhibited COX-2 activity in the screening process, the<br>
two individual standardized extracts, one composed primarily of Free-B-ring flavonoids<br>
(isolated from Scutellaria) and the other of flavans (isolated from Acacia), were compared,<br>
as well as, purified components from each extract and different ratios of the combined<br>
extracts by titrating against a fixed amount of the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This study<br>
revealed that the purified Free-B-ring flavonoids, baicalin and baicalein isolated from<br>
Scutellaria baicalensis and the purified flavan, catechin isolated from Acacia catechu,<br>
inhibited COX-2 and 5-LO activity. Additionally, each of the individual standardized<br>
extracts, which contained concentrations of Free-B-ring flavonoids in the range of 10-90%<br>
(based on HPLC) and fiavans in the range of 10-90% (based on HPLC), also inhibited<br>
COX-2 and 5-LO activity. Finally, the study revealed that compositions containing<br>
mixtures of each of the individual standardized extracts having ratios of Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids to fiavans of approximately 80:20, 50:50, and 20:80, were also all highly<br>
effective at inhibiting COX-2 enzymatic activity in vitro. The results are set forth in<br>
Figures 11-13).<br>
Example 16 describes cell assays performed that targeted inhibition of compounds<br>
in the breakdown of arachidonic acid in the 5-LO pathway, namely LTB4. The results are<br>
set forth in Figures 14 and 15.<br>
Example 17 describes an experiment performed to determine differential inhibition<br>
of the cox-2 gene by Univestin™. Gene expression data was obtained for the inhibition of<br>
cox-l and cox-2 mRNA production in a semi-quantitative RT-qPCR assay. The results are<br>
set forth in Figures 16 and 17. With reference to Figure 16 it can be seen that Univestin™<br>
inhibited cox-2 mRNA production without effecting cox-l gene expression. In addition,<br>
when compared with other COX-2 inhibitor drugs, Univestin™ was able to decrease LPS-<br>
stimulated increases in cox-l and cox-2 gene expression. Importantly, celecoxib and<br>
ibuprofen both increased cox-2 gene expression (Figure 17).<br>
In vivo efficacy was demonstrated by the application of skin irritating substances,<br>
such as AA, to the ears of mice and measuring the reduction of swelling in mice treated<br>
with Univestin™ as described in Example 18. The results are set forth in Figure 18.<br>
Additionally, efficacy at the site of inflammation and pain, was determined by the injection<br>
of an irritant into the ankle joints of mice and measuring the reduction of swelling in mice<br>
treated with Univestin™, as described in Example 19. The results are set forth in Figure<br>
19.<br>
Individual standardized extracts containing concentrations of Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids in the range of 10-99% (based on HPLC) and fiavans in the range of 10-99%<br>
(based on HPLC) as well as the product Univestin™ were tested for toxicity in mice with<br>
chronic and acute administration (data not shown). In the chronic administration protocol,<br>
mice were fed the test articles by oral gavage with daily doses of 90 mg/kg (equivalent to<br>
the human daily dose of 500 mg), 450 mg/kg (five times the daily-dose equivalent) and<br>
900 mg/kg (ten times the daily-dose equivalent). Mice showed no adverse effects in terms<br>
of weight gain, physical appearance or behavior. Gross necropsy results showed no organ<br>
abnormalities and histology of the stomach, kidney, and liver showed no differences<br>
compared to untreated control mice. Full blood work measuring electrolytes, blood<br>
proteins, blood enzymes, and liver enzymes showed no abnormalities compared to the<br>
untreated control mice. In the acute protocol, individual standardized extracts containing<br>
concentrations of Free-B-ring flavonoids in the range of 10-99% (based on HPLC) and<br>
flavans in the range of 10-99% (based on HPLC) as well as the product Univestin™ given<br>
at 2 grams/kg (20 times the daily-dose equivalent) showed no abnormalities in weight<br>
gain, appearance, behavior, gross necropsy appearance of organs, histology of stomach,<br>
kidney, and liver or blood work.<br>
Example 20 describes a clinical study performed to evaluate the efficacy of<br>
Univestin™ on the relief of pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis of the<br>
knee and/or hip. The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-<br>
controlled study. Sixty subjects (n=60) with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis of the<br>
knee and/or hip were randomly placed into four groups and treated for 90 days with a<br>
placebo, Univestin™ (250 mg/day or 500 mg/day) or Celebrex™ (also known as<br>
celecoxib) (200 mg/day). The Univestin™, as illustrated in Example 14, Table 11,<br>
consisted of a proprietary blend of standardized extract of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi<br>
with a baicalin content of 82.2% (w/w) and total Free-B-ring Flavonoids &gt;90% (w/w) and<br>
a standardized extract of Acacia catechu with a total flavan content of 77.2% (w/w) in a<br>
ratio of 85:15. Celebrex™ is a trade name for a prescription drug that is a COX-2 selective<br>
inhibitor. Table 12 sets forth the WOMAC index scores for pain, stiffness and function<br>
before treatment (baseline scores) and at 30, 60 and 90 days. Table 13 sets forth the<br>
absolute changes in WOMAC index scores for pain, stiffness and function after treatment<br>
for 30, 60 and 90 days. Figures 20-31 illustrate the results of this study graphically<br>
plotting the 95% confidence intervals for all data,<br>
As shown in the Figures 20 to 31, the WOMAC composite scores and individual<br>
subscores, related to pain, stiffness and physical function exhibited significant<br>
improvements during administration of Univestin™ compared to the placebo group.<br>
Further, Univestin™ exhibited a similar effectiveness on pain relieve, better effectiveness<br>
at decreasing stiffness, and marked improvement of physical function compared to the<br>
prescription drug Celebrex™. The greatest significance can be seen in comparing each<br>
dose of Univestin™ to the placebo and celecoxib in relieving pain, stiffness and functional<br>
impairment associated with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Multiple post-hoc comparisons for each treatment group pairs within the Analysis<br>
of Variance models showed that Univestin™ at 500 mg/day was significantly more<br>
effective than celecoxib at 200 mg/day for the reduction of pain caused osteoarthritis<br>
during the 30 days (p=0.020) of treatment. In addition, the administration of a dose of 500<br>
mg/day of Univestin™ was also significantly more effective than the placebo for the<br>
reduction of pain within 30 days (p=0.044), 60 days (p=0.032) and 90 days (p=0.001) of<br>
treatment. Celecoxib at 200 mg/day showed significance for the reduction of pain vs. the<br>
placebo at 60 days (p=0.009) of treatment. At 90 days, the 500 mg/day Univestin™ dose<br>
showed significantly higher effectiveness compared to the 250 mg/day dose within 90 days<br>
(p=0.038) of treatment.<br>
Univestin™ at 250 mg/day was significantly more effective than the placebo for the<br>
reduction of stiffness caused by osteoarthritis, within 30 days (p=0.00), 60 days (p=0.027)<br>
and 90 days (p=0.015) of treatment. In addition, Univestin™ at a dose of 500 mg/day was<br>
significantly more effective than placebo for reduction of stiffness caused by osteoarthritis,<br>
within 30 days (p=0.001) and 90 days (p=0.005) of treatment. Celecoxib at 200 mg/day<br>
showed significantly more effectiveness than the placebo for the reduction of stiffness<br>
caused by osteoarthritis only at 30 days (p=0.023) of treatment.<br>
For reduction of functional impairment caused by osteoarthritis, Univestin™ was<br>
significantly more effective than celecoxib at 200 mg/day within 30 days (p=0.010) of<br>
treatment. In addition, the 250 mg/day dose of Univestin™ was also significantly more<br>
effective than placebo for the reduction of functional impairment caused by osteoarthritis<br>
within 30 days (p=0.010), 60 days (p=0.043) and 90 days (p=0.039) of treatment. The 500<br>
mg/day dose of Univestin™ was more effective than celecoxib at 200 mg/day within 30<br>
days (p=0.015), 60 days (p=0.043) and 90 days (0.039) of treatment. Finally, the 500<br>
mg/day dose of Univestin™ was also significantly more effective than placebo for the<br>
reduction of functional impairment caused by osteoarthritis within 30 days (p=0.015), 60<br>
days (p=0.016) and 90 days (p=0.003) of treatment.<br>
These results suggest that Univestin™, particularly at a dosage of 500 mg/day, is<br>
much more effective than the placebo and celecoxib at relieving pain, stiffness and<br>
improving functional impairment caused by osteoarthritis. Additionally, Univestin™<br>
administered at a dosage of 250 mg/day is also very effective at relieving stiffness and<br>
improving functional impairment caused by osteoarthritis compared to the placebo and<br>
celecoxib. Celecoxib also showed only marginal improvement overall in relieving pain,<br>
stiffness and functional impairment caused by osteoarthritis.<br>
In addition to the effects of Univestin™ on pain, stiffness and functional<br>
impairment caused by osteoarthritis, Example 21 shows a measurable effect by<br>
Univestin™ on body mass index (BMI) and weight loss. While not limited by theory, this<br>
effect may be due to an increase in mobility as a result of the administration of an anti-<br>
inflammatory or may also be due to a specific mechanism that increases metabolism or<br>
reduces the utilization of fats and carbohydrates in the body. Table 14 shows the effect of<br>
Univestin™ administered at a dose of 250 and 500 mg/day as well as celecoxib and<br>
placebo on weight and BMI after 30 and 90 days of treatment. The results are illustrated<br>
graphically in Figures 32 and 33. With reference to Figures 32 and 33, it can be seen that<br>
Univestin™ administered at a dosage of both 250 and 500 mg/day resulted in a significant<br>
drop in weight and BMI after thirty days, with weight loss almost doubling after 90 days.<br>
Celecoxib had a smaller effect on weight and BMI as compared to Univestin™.<br>
Multiple post-hoc comparisons for each treatment group pairs with the Analysis of<br>
Variance models were also performed for weight loss and BMI as described in Example<br>
21. These analyses showed that Univestin™ at 250 mg/day and 500 mg/day doses caused<br>
statistically significant weight loss (p=0.011 vs. p=0.118) against the placebo after 30 days<br>
of treatment. Celecoxib did not cause significant weight loss against placebo at 30 days.<br>
The weight loss continued throughout 90 days of treatment with Univestin™ at 250 and<br>
500 mg/day with statistical significance versus placebo (p=0.001 and 0.01 receptively).<br>
Celecoxib still did not show significance relative to the placebo. The decrease of BMI<br>
followed similar trends for the 250 mg/day dose of Univestin™ which was significant<br>
relative to the placebo after 30 days (p=0.008) as well as 90 days (p=0.001). The 500<br>
mg/day dose of Univestin showed decreasing of BMI without statistical significance at<br>
30 days of treatment. However, the decrease of BMI reached statistical significance 90<br>
days of treatment (p=0.011). Again, after 90 days of treatment, the celecoxib treatment<br>
group showed no statistically significant changes in BMI versus placebo.<br>
Example 22 suggests that administration of Univestin™ may affect blood glucose<br>
levels as we{l as its effect on weight loss and BMI. Measurable differences in blood<br>
glucose levels are detected with 30 days of initiating treatment with Univestin™. At 90<br>
days, both the 250 and 500 mg/day Univestin™ treated groups showed significant drops in<br>
blood glucose levels. The effect of celecoxib on blood glucose was less dramatic. The<br>
results are set forth in Table 15 and illustrated graphically in Figure 34.<br>
Once again multiple post-hoc comparisons for each treatment group pairs with the<br>
Analysis of Variance models were also performed for blood glucose as described in<br>
Example 22. Only the 500 mg/day dose of Univestin™ showed statistically relevant<br>
significance versus the placebo group (after30 days, p=0.028; after 90 days, p=0.022). T he<br>
250 mg/day dose of Univestin™, however, showed clinically significant changes in blood<br>
glucose levels versus the placebo.<br>
The applicant believes that U.S. Application Serial No. 10/104,477, filed March<br>
22, 2002, entitled "Isolation of a Dual COX-2 and 5-Lipoxygenase Inhibitor from Acacia,"<br>
is the first report of a composition of matter isolated from the Acacia genus of plants that<br>
demonstrates dual specificity for COX-2 and 5-LO and that U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
10/091,362, filed March 1, 2002, entitled "Identification of Free-B-ring Flavonoids as<br>
Potent COX-2 Inhibitors," is the first report of a correlation between Free-B-ring flavonoid<br>
structure and COX-2 inhibitory activity. These discoveries led to a novel blending of two<br>
classes of specific compounds —Free-B-ring flavonoids and flavans—to produce a<br>
composition of matter, referred to herein as Univestin™, which can be used for alleviating<br>
joint pain and stiffness, improving mobility and physical function and preventing and<br>
treating the pathological conditions of osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
While not limited by theory, the identified mechanism of action of this formulation<br>
is believed to be the direct inhibition of both the peroxidase activity of the COX-2 enzyme<br>
and the 5-LO enzyme activity, together with a decrease in the mRNA production of each<br>
of these enzymes. Univestin™ can also be utilized to prevent and treat COX-2 and 5-LO<br>
mediated diseases and conditions, including, but are not limited to osteoarthritis,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, menstrual cramps, arteriosclerosis, heart attack, obesity, diabetes,<br>
syndrome X, Alzheimer"s disease, respiratory allergic reaction, chronic venous<br>
insufficiency, hemorrhoids, Systemic Lupus Erythromatosis, psoriasis, chronic tension<br>
headache, migraine headaches, inflammatory bowl disease; topical infections caused by<br>
virus, bacteria, fungus, sunburn, thermal burns, contact dermatitis, melanoma and<br>
carcinoma. Finally, Univestin™ has been found in human clinical study that it can cause<br>
weight loss and reduce blood glucose level due to improvement of flexibility, mobility and<br>
increase physical activity.<br>
The present invention is also directed toward therapeutic compositions comprising<br>
the therapeutic agents of the present invention. The therapeutic agents of the instant<br>
invention can be administered by any suitable means, including, for example, parenteral,<br>
topical, oral or local administration, such as intradermally, by injection, or by aerosol. The<br>
particular mode of administration will depend on the condition to be treated. It is<br>
contemplated that administration of the agents of the present invention may be via any<br>
bodily fluid, or any target or any tissue accessible through a body fluid. In the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the agent is administered by injection. Such injection can be<br>
locally administered to any affected area. A therapeutic composition can be administered<br>
in a variety of unit dosage forms depending upon the method of administration. For<br>
example, unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration of an animal include powder,<br>
tablets, pills and capsules. Preferred delivery methods for a therapeutic composition of the<br>
present invention include intravenous administration and local administration by, for<br>
example, injection or topical administration. A therapeutic reagent of the present<br>
invention can be administered to any animal, preferably to mammals, and more preferably<br>
to humans.<br>
For particular modes of delivery, a therapeutic composition of the present invention<br>
can be formulated so as to include other components such as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient, an adjuvant, and/or a carrier. For example, compositions of the present<br>
invention can be formulated in an excipient that the animal to be treated can tolerate.<br>
Examples of such excipients, include but are not limited to cellulose, silicon dioxide,<br>
dextrates, sucrose, sodium starch glycolate, calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, water,<br>
saline, Ringer"s solution, dextrose solution, mannitol, Hank"s solution, and other aqueous<br>
physiologically balanced salt solutions. Nonaqueous vehicles, such as fixed oils, sesame<br>
oil, ethyl oleate, or triglycerides may also be used. Other useful formulations include<br>
suspensions containing viscosity-enhancing agents, such as sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Excipients can also contain minor amounts<br>
of additives, such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Examples<br>
of buffers include phosphate buffer, bicarbonate buffer, Tris buffer, histidine, citrate, and<br>
glycine, or mixtures thereof, while examples of preservatives include thimerosal, m- or o-<br>
cresol, formalin and benzyl alcohol. Standard formulations can either be liquid injectables<br>
or solids, which can be taken up in a suitable liquid as a suspension or solution for<br>
injection. Thus, in a non-liquid formulation, the excipient can comprise dextrose, human<br>
serum albumin, preservatives, etc., to which sterile water or saline can be added prior to<br>
administration.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the composition can also include an<br>
adjuvant or a carrier. Adjuvants are typically substances that generally enhance the<br>
function of the formula in preventing and treating indications related to COX &amp; LO<br>
pathways. Suitable adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund"s adjuvant; other<br>
bacterial cell wall components; aluminum-based salts; calcium-based salts; silica; boron,<br>
histidine, glucosamine sulfates, Chondroitin sulfate, copper gluconate, polynucleotides;<br>
vitamin D, vitamin K, toxoids; shark and bovine cartilage; serum proteins; viral coat<br>
proteins; other bacterial-derived preparations; gamma interferon; block copolymer<br>
adjuvants, such as Hunter"s Titermax adjuvant (Vaxcel.TM., Inc. Norcross, Ga.); Ribi<br>
adjuvants (available from Ribi ImmunoChem Research, Inc., Hamilton, Mont.); and<br>
saponins and their derivatives, such as Quil A (available from Superfos Biosector A/S,<br>
Denmark). Carriers are typically compounds that increase the half-life of a therapeutic<br>
composition in the treated animal. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to,<br>
polymeric controlled release formulations, biodegradable implants, liposomes, bacteria,<br>
viruses, oils, esters, and glycols.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a controlled release formulation that is<br>
capable of slowly releasing a composition of the present invention into an animal As used<br>
herein, a controlled release formulation comprises a composition of the present invention<br>
in a controlled release vehicle. Suitable controlled release vehicles include, but are not<br>
limited to, biocompatible polymers, other polymeric matrices, capsules, microcapsules,<br>
microparticles, bolus preparations, osmotic pumps, diffusion devices, liposomes,<br>
lipospheres, and transdermal delivery systems. Other controlled release formulations of<br>
the present invention include liquids that, upon administration to an animal, form a solid<br>
or a gel in situ. Preferred controlled release formulations are biodegradable (i.e.,<br>
bioerodible).<br>
Once the therapeutic composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile<br>
vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or dehydrated or lyophilized powder,<br>
or directly capsulated and/or tableted with other inert carriers for oral administration. Such<br>
formulations may be stored either in a ready to use form or requiring reconstitution<br>
immediately prior to administration. The manner of administering formulations containing<br>
the compositions for systemic delivery may be via oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous, intranasal or vaginal or rectal suppository.<br>
The amount of the composition that will be effective in the treatment of a particular<br>
disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder of condition, which can be<br>
determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays may<br>
optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be<br>
employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the<br>
seriousness or advancement of the disease or condition, and should be decided according<br>
to the practitioner and each patient"s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated<br>
from dose-response curved derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. For<br>
example, an effective amount of the composition can readily be determined by<br>
administering graded doses of the composition and observing the desired effect.<br>
The method of treatment according to this invention comprises administering<br>
internally or topically to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of the<br>
composition comprised of a mixture of Free-B-ring flavonoids and flavans. The purity of<br>
the mixture includes, but is not limited to 0.01% to 100%, depending on the methodology<br>
used to obtain the compound(s). In a preferred embodiment, doses of the mixture of Free-<br>
B-ring flavonoids and flavans and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same are an<br>
efficacious, nontoxic quantity generally selected from the range of 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of<br>
body weight. Persons skilled in the art using routine clinical testing are able to determine<br>
optimum doses for the particular ailment being treated.<br>
The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Preparation of Organic and Aqueous Extracts from Acacia and Scutellaria<br>
Plants<br>
Plant material from Acacia catechu (L) Willd. barks, Scutellaria orthocalyx roots,<br>
Scutellaria baicalensis roots or Scutellaria lateriflora whole plant was ground to a particle<br>
size of no larger than 2 mm. Dried ground plant material (60 g) was then transferred to an<br>
Erlenmeyer flask and methanol:dichloromethane (1:1) (600 mL) was added. The mixture<br>
was shaken for one hour, filtered and the biomass was extracted again with methanol:<br>
dichloromethane (1:1) (600 mL). The organic extracts were combined and evaporated<br>
under vacuum to provide the organic extract (see Table 1 below). After organic extraction,<br>
the biomass was air dried and extracted once with ultra pure water (600 mL). The aqueous<br>
solution was filtered and freeze-dried to provide the aqueous extract (see Table 1 below).<br>
The bioassay directed screening process for the identification of specific COX-2<br>
inhibitors was designed to assay the peroxidase activity of the enzyme as described below.<br>
Peroxidase Assay. The assay to detect inhibitors of COX-2 was modified for a<br>
high throughput platform (Raz). Briefly, recombinant ovine COX-2 (Cayman) in<br>
peroxidase buffer (100 mM TBS, 5 mM EDTA, 1 µM Heme, 1 mg epinephrine, 0.094%<br>
phenol) was incubated with extract (1:500 dilution) for 15 minutes. Quantablu (Pierce)<br>
substrate was added and allowed to develop for 45 minutes at 25 °C. Luminescence was<br>
then read using a Wallac Victor 2 plate reader. The results are presented in Table 2.<br>
Table 2 sets forth the inhibition of enzyme by the organic and aqueous extracts<br>
obtained from five plant species, including the bark of Acacia catechu, roots of two<br>
Scutellaria species and extracts from three other plant species, which are comprised of<br>
structurally similar Free-B-ring flavonoids. Data is presented as the percent of peroxidase<br>
activity relative to the recombinant ovine COX-2 enzyme and substrate alone. The percent<br>
inhibition by the organic extract ranged from 30% to 90%.<br><br>
Comparison of the relative inhibition of the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms requires<br>
the generation of IC50 values for each of these enzymes. The IC50 is defined as the<br>
concentration at which 50% inhibition of enzyme activity in relation to the control is<br>
achieved by a particular inhibitor. In these experiments, IC50 values were found to range<br>
from 6 to 50 µg/mL and 7 to 80 µg/mL for the COX-2 and COX-1 enzymes, respectively,<br>
as set forth in Table 3. Comparison of the IC50 values of COX-2 and COX-1 demonstrates<br>
the specificity of the organic extracts from various plants for each of these enzymes. The<br>
organic extract of Scutellaria lateriflora for example, shows preferential inhibition of<br>
COX-2 over COX-1 with IC50 values of 30 and 80 µg/mL, respectively. While some<br>
extracts demonstrate preferential inhibition of COX-2, others do not. Examination of the<br>
HTP fractions and purified compounds from these fractions is necessary to determine the<br>
true specificity of inhibition for these extracts and compounds.<br>
Example 3. HTP Fractionation of Active Extracts<br>
Organic extract (400 mg) from active plant was loaded onto a prepacked flash,<br>
column. (2 cm ID x 8.2 cm, 10g silica gel). The column was eluted using a Hitachi high<br>
throughput purification (HTP) system with a gradient mobile phase of (A) 50:50<br>
EtOAc:hexane and (B) methanol from 100% A to 100% B in 30 minutes at a flow rate of 5<br>
mL/min. The separation was monitored using a broadband wavelength UV detector and<br>
the fractions were collected in a 96-deep-well plate at 1.9 mL/well using a Gilson fraction<br>
collector. The sample plate was dried under low vacuum and centrifugation. DMSO (1.5<br>
mL) was used to dissolve the samples in each cell and a portion (100 µL was taken for the<br>
COX inhibition assay.<br>
Aqueous extract (750 mg) from active plant was dissolved in water (5 mL), filtered<br>
through a 1 µm syringe filter and transferred to a 4 mL High Pressure Liquid<br>
Chromatography (HPLC) vial. The solution was then injected by an autosampler onto a<br>
prepacked reverse phase column (C-18, 15 µm particle size, 2.5 cm ID x 10 cm with<br>
precolumn insert). The column was eluted using a Hitachi high throughput purification<br>
(HTP) system with a gradient mobile phase of (A) water and (B) methanol from 100% A<br>
to 100% B in 20 minutes, followed by 100% methanol for 5 minutes at a flow rate of 10<br>
mL/min. The separation was monitored using a broadband wavelength UV detector and<br>
the fractions were collected in a 96-deep-well plate at 1.9 mL/well using a Gilson fraction<br>
collector. The sample plate was freeze-dried. Ultra pure water (1.5 mL) was used to<br>
dissolve samples in each cell and a portion (100 µL) was taken for the COX inhibition<br>
assay.<br>
Example 4. Inhibition of COX Peroxidase Activity by HTP Fractions from Acacia and<br>
Scutellaria Species<br>
Individual bioactive organic extracts were further characterized by examining each<br>
of the HTP fractions for the ability to inhibit the peroxidase activity of both COX-1 and<br>
COX-2 recombinant enzymes. The results are presented in Figures 1 and 2, which depict<br>
the inhibition of COX-2 and COX-1 activity by HTP fractions from organic extracts of the<br>
bark of Acacia catechu and the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis isolated as described in<br>
Examples 1 and 3 and assayed as described in Example 2. The profiles depicted in Figures<br>
1 and 2 show multiple peaks of inhibition that indicate multiple active components in each<br>
extract. Several active peaks are very selective for COX-2. Other Scutellaria sp.<br>
including Scutellaria orthocalyx and Scutellaria lateriflora demonstrate a similar peak of<br>
inhibition (data not shown). However, both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes demonstrate<br>
multiple peaks of inhibition suggesting that there is more than one molecule contributing<br>
to the initial inhibition profiles.<br>
Example 5. Isolation and Purification of the Active Free-B-ring Flavonoids from the<br>
Organic Extract of Scutellaria<br>
The organic extract (5 g) from the roots of Scutellaria orthocalyx, isolated as<br>
described in Example 1, was loaded onto prepacked flash column (120 g silica, 40 µm<br>
particle size 32-60 µm, 25 cm x 4 cm) and eluted with a gradient mobile phase of (A)<br>
50:50 EtOAc:hexane and (B) methanol from 100% A to 100% B in 60 minutes at a flow<br>
rate of 15 mL/min. The fractions were collected in test tubes at 10 mL/fraction. The<br>
solvent was evaporated under vacuum and the sample in each fraction was dissolved in 1<br>
mL of DMSO and an aliquot of 20 µL was transferred to a 96 well shallow dish plate and<br>
tested for COX inhibitory activity. Based on the COX assay results, active fractions #31 to<br>
#39 were combined and evaporated. Analysis by HPLC/PDA and LC/MS showed a major<br>
compound with a retention times of 8.9 minutes and a MS peak at 272 m/e. The product<br>
was further purified on a C18 semi-preparation column (25 cm x 1 cm), with a gradient<br>
mobile phase of (A) water and (B) methanol, over a period of 45 minutes at a flow rate of<br>
5 mL/minute. Eighty-eight fractions were collected to yield 5.6 mg of light yellow solid.<br>
Purity was determined by HPLC/PDA and LC/MS, and comparison with standards and<br>
NMR data. 1H NMR: 5 ppm. (DMS0-d6) 8.088 (2H, m, H-3",5"), 7.577 (3H, m, H-<br>
2",4",6"), 6.932 (1H, s, H-8), 6.613 (1H, s, H-3). MS: [M+l]+ = 271m/e. The compound<br>
was identified as baicalein. The IC50 of baicalein against the COX-2 enzyme was<br>
determined to be 10 µg/mL.<br>
Using preparative C-18 column chromatography, other Free-B-ring flavonoids<br>
were isolated and identified using a standardized extract isolated from the roots of<br>
Scutellaria baicalensis (lot # RM052302-01), having a Free-B-ring flavonoid content of<br>
82.2%. Eleven structures were elucidated using HPLC/PDA/MS as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
With reference to Figure 3, the eleven compounds identified were baicalin, wogonin-7-<br>
glucuronide, oroxylin A 7-glucuronide, baicalein, wogonin, chrysin-7-glucuronide, 5-<br>
methyl-wogonin-7-glucuronide, scutellarin, norwogonin, chrysin and oroxylin A.<br>
Example 6. COX Inhibition of Purified Free-B-ring Flavonoids<br>
Several Free-B-ring flavonoids have been obtained and tested at a concentration of<br>
20 µg/mL for COX-2 inhibitory activity using the methods described in Example 2. The<br>
results are summarized in Table 4.<br>
Measurement of the IC50 of baicalein, baicalin and a standardized Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoid extract isolated from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis was performed using<br>
the following method. A cleavable, peroxide chromophore was included in the assay to<br>
visualize the peroxidase activity of each enzyme in the presence of arachidonic acid as a<br>
cofactor. Typically, the assays were performed in a 96-well format. Each inhibitor, taken<br>
from a 10 mg/mL stock in 100% DMSO, was tested in triplicate at room temperature using<br>
the following range of concentrations: 0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 µg/mL. To<br>
each well, 150 µL of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was added along with 10 µL of 22 µM<br>
Hematin diluted in tris buffer, 10 µL of inhibitor diluted in DMSO, and 25 units of either<br>
COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme. The components were mixed for 10 seconds on a rotating<br>
platform, after which 20 µL of 2 mM HN,N"N"-Tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine<br>
dihydrochloride (TMPD) and 20 µL of 1.1 mM AA was added to initiate the reaction. The<br>
plate was shaken for 10 seconds and then incubated for 5 minutes before reading the<br>
absorbance at 570 nm. The inhibitor concentration vs. percentage inhibition was plotted<br>
and the IC50 determined by taking the half-maximal point along the isotherm and<br>
intersecting the concentration on the x-axis. The IC50 was then normalized to the number<br>
of enzyme units in the assay. The dose response and IC50 results for baicalein, baicalin and<br>
a standardized Free-B-ring flavonoid extract isolated from the roots of Scutellaria<br>
baicalensis are provided in Figures 4,5 and 6, respectively.<br>
The presence and quantity of Free-B-nng flavonoids in five active extracts isolated<br>
from three different plant species have been confirmed and are set forth in the Table 5.<br>
The Free-B-ring flavonoids were quantitatively analyzed by HPLC using a Luna C-18<br>
column (250 x 4.5 mm, 5 pan) a using 1% phosphoric acid and acetonitrile gradient from<br>
80% to 20% in 22 minutes. The Free-B-ring flavonoids were detected using a UV detector<br>
at 254 run and identified based on retention time by comparison with Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoid standards.<br>
Example 8. Isolation and Purification of Active Compounds from the Organic Extract of<br>
Acacia catechu<br>
The organic extract (5 g) from the roots of A. catechu, isolated as described in<br>
Example 1, was loaded onto prepacked flash column (120 g silica, 40 (Jim particle size 32-<br>
60 /an, 25 cm x 4 cm) and eluted with a gradient mobile phase of (A) 50:50 EtOAc:hexane<br>
and (B) methanol from 100% A to 100% B in 60 minutes at a flow rate of 15 mL/min.<br>
The fractions were collected in test tubes at 10 mL/fraction. The solvent was evaporated<br>
under vacuum and the sample in each fraction was dissolved in DMSO (1 mL) and an<br>
aliquot of 20 µL was transferred to a 96 well shallow dish plate and tested for COX<br>
inhibitory activity. Based upon the COX assay results, active fractions #32 to #41 were<br>
combined and evaporated to yield 2.6 g of solid. Analysis by HPLC/PDA and LC/MS<br>
showed two major compounds with retention times of 15.8 and 16.1 minutes, respectively.<br>
The product was farther purified on a C18 semi-preparatory column (25 cm x 1 cm),<br>
loaded with 212.4 mg of product and eluted with a gradient mobile phase of (A) water and<br>
(B) acetonitrile (ACN), over a period of 60 minutes at a flow rate of 5 mL/minute. Eighty-<br>
eight fractions were collected and two active compounds were isolated. Compound 1<br>
(11.5 mg) and Compound 2 (16.6 mg). Purity was determined by HPLC/PDA and LC/MS<br>
data by comparison with standards (catechin and epicatechin) and NMR data.<br>

291 m/e. This compound was identified as epicatechin.<br>
The dose response and IC50 results for catechin and a standardized flavan extract<br>
isolated from the bark of A catechu are illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, using the method<br>
described in Example 6. The IC50 values of epicatechin against the COX-1 and COX-2<br>
enzymes are 7 µg/mL and 20 µg/mL, respectively.<br>
Example 9. HPLC Quantification of Active Extracts from Acacia catechu<br>
The flavan content in the organic and aqueous extracts isolated from Acacia<br>
catechu were quantified by HPLC using a PhotoDiode Array detector (HPLC/PDA) and a<br>
Luna C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm). The fiavans were eluted from the column using an<br>
acetonitrile gradient from 10% to 30% ACN over a period of 20 minutes, followed by 60%<br>
ACN for five minutes. The results are set forth in Table 6. A profile of the HPLC<br>
purification is shown in Figure 9. The flavans were quantified based on retention time and<br>
PDA data using catechin and epicatechin as standards. The retention times for the two<br>
major flavans were 12.73 minutes and 15.76 minutes, respectively.<br>
Example 10. In vitro Study of COX Inhibitory Activity of Organic Extracts from Acacia<br>
catechu and Scutellaria Species<br>
In vitro efficacy and COX-2 specificity of organic extracts isolated from Acacia<br>
catechu and various Scutellaria species were tested in cell-based systems for their ability<br>
to inhibit the generation of AA metabolites. Cell lines HOSC, which constitutively<br>
express COX-2 and THP-1, which express COX-1 were tested for their ability to generate<br>
PGE2 in the presence of AA.<br>
COX-2 Cell Based Assay. HOSC (ATCC#8304-CRL) cells were cultured to 80-<br>
90% confluence. The cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in 10 mL at 1 x 106<br>
cells/mL in tissue culture media (MEM). The cell suspension (200 µL) was plated out in<br>
96-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. The media<br>
was then replaced with new HOSC media containing 1 ng/mL IL-1b and incubated<br>
overnight. The media was removed again and replaced with 190 mL HOSC media. Test<br>
compounds were then added in 10 µL of HOSC media and were incubated for 15 minutes<br>
at 37°C. Arachidonic acid in HOSC media (20 mL, 100 /iM) was added and the mixture<br>
was incubated for 10 minutes on a shaker at room temperature. Supernatant (20 /xL) was<br>
transferred to new plates containing 190 µL/well of 100 µM indomethacin in ELISA<br>
buffer. The supernatants were analyzed as described below by ELISA.<br>
COX-1 Cell Based Assay. THP-1 cells were suspended to a volume of 30 mL<br>
(5x105 cells/mL). TPA was added to a final concentration of 10 nM TPA and cultured for<br>
48 hours to differentiate cells to macrophage (adherent). The cells were resuspended in<br>
HBSS (25 mL) and added to 96-well plates in 200 mL volumes at 5 x 105 cells/well. The<br>
test compounds in RPMI1640 (10 µL) were then added and incubated for 15 minutes at<br>
37°C. Arachidonic acid in RPMI (20 µL) was then added and the mixture was incubated<br>
for 10 minutes on a shaker at room temperature. Supernatant (20 fiL) was added to ELISA<br>
buffer (190 µL) containing indomethacin (100 µM). The supernatants were then analyzed<br>
by ELISA, as described below.<br>
COX-2 Whole Blood Assay. Peripheral blood from normal healthy donors was<br>
collected by venipuncture. Whole blood (500 µL) was incubated with test compounds and<br>
extracts for 15 minutes at 37°C. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from E. coli serotype 0111 :B4)<br>
was added to a final concentration of 100 µg/mL and cultured overnight at 37°C. The<br>
blood was centrifuged (12,000 x g) and the plasma was collected. Plasma (100 µL) was<br>
added to methanol (400 µL) to precipitate proteins. Supernatants were measured for PGE2<br>
production by ELISA. This procedure is a modification of the methods described by<br>
Brideau et al (1996) Inflamm. Res. 45:68-74.<br>
COX-1 Whole Blood Assay. Fresh blood was collected in tubes not containing<br>
anti-coagulants and immediately aliquoted into 500 µL aliquots in siliconized<br>
microcentrifuge tubes. Test samples were added, vortexed and allowed to clot for 1 hour<br>
at 37°C. The samples were then centrifuged (12,000 x g) and the plasma was collected.<br>
The plasma (100 µL) was added to methanol (400 µL) to precipitate proteins.<br>
Supernatants were measured for TXB2 production by ELISA. This procedure is a<br>
modification of the methods described by Brideau et al. (1996) Inflamm. Res. 45:68-74.<br>
ELISA Assays. Immunolon-4 ELISA plates were coated with capture antibody<br>
0.5-4 µg/mL in carbonate buffer (pH 9.2) overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed and<br>
incubated for 2 hours with blocking buffer (PBS + 1% BSA) at room temperature. The<br>
plates were washed again and test sample (100 µL) was added and incubated for 1 hour at<br>
room temperature while shaking. Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody was added in<br>
a 50 µL volume containing 0.5-4 mg/mL and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature<br>
while shaking. The plates were then washed three times and TMB substrate (100 µL) was<br>
added. The plates were allowed to develop for 30 minutes, after which the reaction was<br>
stopped by the addition of 1 M phosphoric acid (100 µL). The plates were then read at 450<br>
run using a Wallac Victor 2 plate reader.<br>
Cytotoxicity. Cellular cytotoxicity was assessed using a colorimetric kit (Oxford<br>
Biochemical Research) that measures the release of lactate dehydrogenase in damaged<br>
cells. Assays were completed according to manufacturer"s directions. Both purified<br>
flavans and standardized extract from Acacia catechu were tested. No cytotoxicity was<br>
observed for any of the tested compounds.<br>
The results of the assays are set forth in Table 7. The data are presented as IC50<br>
values for direct comparison. With reference to Table 5, IC50 values are generally lower<br>
for COX-1 than COX-2. Additionally, whole blood was also measured for the differential<br>
inhibition of PGE2 generation (a measure of COX-2 in this system) or thromboxane B2<br>
(TXB2) (a measure of COX-1 activation). Referring to Table 7, these studies clearly<br>
demonstrate specificity for COX-2 inhibition within the assays based on whole blood cells.<br>
However, studies using the THP-1 and HOSC-based model system actually showed greater<br>
selectivity for COX-1. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are the fundamental<br>
differences between immortalized cell lines that constitutively express each of the enzymes<br>
and primary cells derived from whole blood that are induced to express COX enzymes.<br>
Primary cells are a more relevant model to study inflammation in vivo. Additionally, the<br>
compounds used to identify COX-1 vs. COX-2 activity vary in each of these systems and<br>
consequently are not directly comparable.<br>
Example 11. Inhibition of 5-Lipoxvgenase bv the Catechin from Acacia catechu<br>
As noted above, one of the most important pathways involved in the inflammatory<br>
response is produced by non-heme, iron-containing lipoxygenases (5-LO, 12-LO, and 15-<br>
LO), which catalyze the addition of molecular oxygen onto fatty acids such as AA (AA) to<br>
produce the hydroperoxides 5-, 12- and 15-HPETE, which are then converted to<br>
leukotrienes. There were early indications that the flavan extract from A. catechu may<br>
provide some degree of 5-LO inhibition, thereby preventing the formation of 5-HPETE. A<br>
Lipoxygenase Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Inc., Cat# 760700) was<br>
used to assess whether the purified flavan catechin from Acacia catechu directly inhibited<br>
5-LO in vitro. The 15-LO from soybeans normally used in the kit was replaced with<br>
potato 5-LO, after a buffer change from phosphate to a tris -based buffer using<br>
microfiltration was performed. This assay detects the formation of hydroperoxides<br>
through an oxygen sensing chromagen. Briefly, the assay was performed in triplicate by<br>
adding 90 µL of 0.17 units/µL potato 5-LO, 20 µL of 1.1 mM AA, 100 µL of oxygen-<br>
sensing chromagen, and 10 µL of purified flavan inhibitor to final concentrations ranging<br>
from 0 to 500 µg/mL. The IC50 for 5-LO inhibition from catechin was determined to be<br>
1.38 µg/mL/unit of enzyme.<br>
Example 12. Preparation of a Standardized Extract from Acacia catechu<br>
Acacia catechu (500 mg of ground bark) was extracted with the following solvent<br>
systems. (1) 100% water, (2) 80:20 water:methanol, (3) 60:40 watermethanol, (4) 40:60<br>
water.methanol, (5) 20:80 watermethanol, (6) 100% methanol, (7) 80:20 methanol:THF,<br>
(8) 60:40 methanol:THF. The extracts were concentrated and dried under low vacuum.<br>
The identification of the chemical components in each extract was achieved by HPLC<br>
using a PhotoDiode Array detector (HPLC/PDA) and a 250 mm x 4.6 mm C18 column.<br>
The chemical components were quantified based on retention time and PDA data using<br>
catechin and epicatechin as standards. The results are set forth in Table 8 and Figure 9.<br>
As shown in Table 6, the fiavan extract generated from solvent extraction with 80%<br>
methanol/water provided the best concentration of flavan components.<br>
Scutellaria orthocalyx (500 mg of ground root) was extracted twice with 25 mL of<br>
the following solvent systems. (1) 100% water, (2) 80:20 water:methanol, (3) 60:40<br>
water:methanol, (4) 40:60 watenmethanol, (5) 20:80 water:methanol, (6) 100% methanol,<br>
(7) 80:20 methanol:THF, (8) 60:40 methanol:THF. The extracts were combined,<br>
concentrated and dried under low vacuum. Identification of chemical components in each<br>
extract was performed by HPLC using a PhotoDiode Array detector (HPLC/PDA) and a<br>
250 mm x 4.6 mm C18 column. The chemical components were quantified based on<br>
retention time and PDA data using baicalein, baicalin, scutellarein, and wogonin as<br>
standards. The results are set forth in Table 9.<br>
Scutellaria baicalensis (1000 mg of ground root) was extracted twice using 50 mL<br>
of a mixture of methanol and water as follows: (1) 100% water, (2) 70:30 water:methanol,<br>
(3) 50:50 water:methanol, (4) 30:70 water:methanol, (5) 100% methanol. The extracts<br>
were combined, concentrated and dried under low vacuum. Identification of the chemical<br>
components was performed by HPLC using a PhotoDiode Array detector (HPLC/PDA),<br>
and a 250 mm x 4.6 mm C18 column. The chemical components in each extract were<br>
quantified based on retention time and PDA data using baicalein, baicalin, scutellarein,<br>
and wogonin standards. The results are set forth in Table 10.<br>
Example 14. Preparation of a Formulation with a Standardized Free-B-ring Flavonoid<br>
Extract from the Roots of Scutellaria baicalensis and a Standardized Flavan Extract from<br>
the Bark of Acacia catechu<br>
A novel composition of matter, referred to herein as Univestin™ was formulated<br>
using two standardized extracts isolated from Acacia and Scutellaria, respectively,<br>
together with one or more excipients. A general example for preparing such a composition<br>
is set forth below. The Acacia extract used in this example contained &gt;60% total flavans,<br>
as catechin and epicatechin, and the Scutellaria extract contained &gt;70% Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids, which was primarily baicalin. The Scutellaria extract contained other minor<br>
amounts of Free-B-ring flavonoids as set forth in Table 11. One or more exipients is<br>
added to the composition of matter. The ratio of flavan and Free-B-ring flavonoids can be<br>
adjusted based on the indications and the specific requirements with respect to inhibition<br>
of COX-2 vs. 5-LO and potency requirements of the product. The quantity of the<br>
excipients can be adjusted based on the actual active content of each ingredient. A<br>
blending table for each individual batch of product must be generated based on the product<br>
specification and QC results for individual batch of ingredients. Additional amounts of<br>
active ingredients in the range of 2-5% are recommended to meet the product<br>
specification. Table 11 illustrates a blending table that was generated for one batch of<br>
Univestin™ (Lot#G1702-COX-2).<br>
Scutellaria baicalensis root extract (38.5 kg) (lot # RM052302-01) having a Free-<br>
B-ring flavonoid content of 82.2% (baicalin); Acacia catechu bark extract (6.9 kg) (lot #<br>
RM052902-01) with total flavan content of 80.4%; and excipient (5.0 kg of Candex) were<br>
combined to provide a Univestin™ formulation (50.4 kg) having a blending ratio of 85:15.<br>
Table 9 provides the quantification of the active Free-B-ring flavonoids and flavans of this<br>
specific batch of Univestin™ (Lot#G1702-COX-2), determined using the methods<br>
provided in Examples 7 and 9.<br>
With reference to Table 9, this specific batch of Univestin™ contains 86% total<br>
active ingredients, including 75.7% Free-B-ring flavonoids and 10.3% flavans. Two<br>
different dosage levels of final product in capsule form were produced from this batch of<br>
Univestin™ (50.0 kg): 125 mg per dose (60 capsules) and 250 mg per dose (60 capsules).<br>
The final product was evaluated in a human clinical trial as described in Example 15.<br>
Using the same approach, two other batches of Univestin™ were prepared using a<br>
combination of a standardized Free-B-ring flavonoid extract from Scutellaria baicalensis<br>
roots and a standardized flavan extract from Acacia catechu bark having a blending ratio<br>
of 50:50 and 20:80, respectively.<br>
Example 15. Measurements of Dose Response and IC50 Values of COX Enzyme<br>
Inhibitions from Three Formulations of Univestin™<br>
The three different formulations of Univestin™ are produced as provided in<br>
Example 14 were tested for COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activity as described in<br>
Example 6. All three formulation show significant dose response inhibition of COX<br>
enzyme activities as illustrated in Figures 11,12 and 13).<br>
Example 16. Measurements of Dose Response and IC50 Values of LO Enzyme Inhibition<br>
from a Formulation of Univestin™<br>
A Univestin™ sample was produced as outlined in Example 14, using a<br>
combination of a standardized Free-B-ring flavonoid extract from Scutellaria baicalensis<br>
roots and a standardized flavan extract from Acacia catechu bark with a blending ratio of<br>
80:20. The sample was titrated in tissue culture media containing THP-1 or HT-29 cells;<br>
monocyte cell lines that express COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LO. A competitive ELISA for<br>
LTB4 (LTB4; Neogen, Inc., Cat#406110) was used to assess the effect of Univestin™ on<br>
newly synthesized levels of LTB4 present in each cell line as a measure of Univestin™"s<br>
inhibitory effect on the 5-LO pathway. The assay was performed in duplicate by adding<br>
160,000 to 180,000 cells per well in 6-well plates. Univestin™ was added to the THP-1<br>
cultures at 3,10, 30 and 100 µg/mL and incubated overnight (~12-15 hrs) at 37°C with 5%<br>
CO2 in a humidified environment. The results are set forth in Figure 14, which shows that<br>
the production of newly LPS-induced LTB4 was almost completely inhibited by the<br>
addition of Univestin™ to theTHP-1 cultures between 3 and 10 µg/mL.<br>
Univestin™ and ibuprofen, another known 5-LO inhibitor, were added to the HT-<br>
29 cells at 3 µg/mL and incubated 48 hrs at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified<br>
environment. Each treated cell line was then harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by<br>
gentle dounce homogenization lysis in physiological buffers. As shown in Figure 15,<br>
Univestin™ inhibited generation of 80% of the newly synthesized LTB4 in HT-29 cells.<br>
Ibuprofen only showed a 20% reduction in the amount of LTB4 over the same time period.<br>
Example 17. Differential Inhibition of cox-2 but not cox-1 Gene Expression by<br>
Univestin™ vs. Other NSAIDs<br>
To evaluate whether Univestin™ is operating on the genomic level, isolated<br>
human, peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide<br>
(LPS), treated with Univestin™ as illustrated in Example 14, celecoxib, ibuprofen or<br>
acetaminophen, and the total RNA produced was then harvested and evaluated by semi-<br>
quantitative RT-qPCR. Specifically, the assay was constructed by adding 130,000 cells<br>
per well in 6-well plates. The cells were then stimulated with 10 ng/mL LPS and co-<br>
incubated with Univestin™ at 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 |ig/mL and celecoxib, ibuprofen and<br>
acetaminophen at 3 µg/mL for 18 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified<br>
environment. Each cell-treatment condition was then harvested by centrifugation and total<br>
RNA produced was isolated using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen™ Life Technologies,<br>
Cat#15596-026) and the recommended TRIzol® reagent protocol. Total RNA was reverse<br>
transcribed using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT;<br>
Promega Corp., Cat#M1701) using random hexamers (Promega Corp., Cat#C1181).<br>
qPCR experiments were performed on an ABI Prism®7700 Sequence Detection System<br>
using pre-developed validated Assays-on-Demand products (AOD from Applied<br>
Biosystems, Inc., Cat# 4331182) for 18S rRNA internal standard and gene specific assays.<br>
Gene specific expression values were standardized to their respective 18S rRNA gene<br>
expression values (internal control) and then the no-LPS no-drug treatment condition<br>
normalized to 100. Treatment conditions are relative to this null condition.<br>
Univestin™ decreased normalized gene expression of cox-2 by over 100-fold, while<br>
cox-1 normalized gene expression showed little variation. When PBMCs were treated<br>
with 3 µg/mL of Univestin™, celecoxib, ibuprofen or acetaminophen, only Univestin™ did<br>
not increase gene expression of cox-2. It is believed that this is the first report of changes<br>
in gene expression levels of eicosinoids, cytokines, chemokines and other genes implicated<br>
in pain and inflammation pathways following treatment with a mixture of Free-B-ring<br>
flavonoids and flavans using semi-quantitative RT-qPCR techniques. This work has been<br>
coupled work with ELISA-based assays to evaluate changes in protein levels as well as<br>
enzyme function assays to evaluate alterations in protein function. As a result of these<br>
studies, both genomic and proteomic coupled effects following treatment with Univestin™<br>
have been demonstrated. Other studies cited in the literature have used protein specific<br>
methods to infer gene expression rather than show it directly. The results are set forth in<br>
Figures 16 and 17.<br>
Example 18. Evaluation of the Efficacy of Univestin™ with in vivo Mouse Ear Swelling<br>
Model<br>
In order to test whether Univestin™ could be used to treat inflammation in vivo,<br>
the composition, prepared as described in Example 14, was administered by oral gavage to<br>
4-5 week old ICR mice (Harlan Labs) one day before treatment of their ears with AA.<br>
Test mice were fed dose equivalents of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of Univestin™ suspended<br>
in olive oil while control mice were fed only olive oil. The following day, 20 uL of 330<br>
mM AA in 95% alcohol was applied to one ear of each mouse, while alcohol was applied<br>
to the other ear as a control. Mice treated with Univestin™ showed a measurable dose<br>
response that tracked with increasing doses of Univestin™, as demonstrated in Figure 18.<br>
With reference to Figure 18, the 200 mg/kg dose reduces swelling by over 50% as<br>
compared to the minus Univestin™ control. The 50 mg/kg dose of Univestin™ was as<br>
effective as the 50 mg/kg dose of another strong anti-inflammatory, indomethacin.<br>
Example 19. Evaluation Efficacy of Univestin™ with in vivo Mouse Ankle Joint Swelling<br>
Model<br>
Since Univestin™ is designed to target joint pain, a solution of 20 µL of 100 mM<br>
AA in 95% ethanol was injected into the hind ankle joints of 4-5 week old ICR mice<br>
(Harlan Labs) to generate swelling. The test group was fed 100 mg/kg of Univestin™<br>
suspended in olive oil -12 hours before while another group was not given Univestin™.<br>
Control groups included mice that had not received arachidonic acid injections (negative<br>
control) and a group that had 95% ethanol without AA injected (vehicle control). These<br>
groups were also not given Univestin™. The results are set forth in Figure 19. With<br>
reference to Figure 19, the mice given Univestin™ that were injected with AA showed<br>
background levels of swelling as compared to the controls and the untreated arachidonic<br>
injected group. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Univestin™ for reducing<br>
swelling in joints, the site of action.<br>
Example 20. Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy of Free-B-ring Flavonoids and Flavans<br>
on the Relief of Pain Caused by Rheumatoid Arthritis or Osteoarthritis of the Knee and/or<br>
Hip<br>
This clinical study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-<br>
controlled study. Sixty subjects (n=60) with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis of the<br>
knee and/or hip were randomly placed into one of the following four groups:<br>
The Univestin™ was prepared as described in Example 14. This specific batch of<br>
Univestin™ (lot#G1702-COX-2) contains 86% total active ingredients, including 75.7%<br>
Free-B-ring flavonoids and 10.3% flavans. Celecoxib, also known as Celebrex™, is a<br>
trade name for a prescription drug that is a COX-2 selective inhibitor.<br>
Subjects were sex-matched and recruited from ages 40 to 75. Treatment consisted<br>
of oral administration for 90 days of the placebo or active compound (Univestin™ or<br>
celecoxib) according to the above dose schedule. Subjects taking NSAIDs engaged in a<br>
two-week washout period before beginning the study. Physical activity was not restricted,<br>
nor were the subjects given any advice as to diet. Subjects were free to withdraw from the<br>
trial at any time for any reason. The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated at 30, 60 and<br>
90 days of oral administration by physicians, using the Western Ontario and McMaster<br>
Universities (WOMAC) Osteo-Arthritis Index (See Lingard et al. (2001) J. Bone &amp; Joint<br>
Surg. 83:1856-1864; Soderman and Malchau (2000) Acta Orthop. Scand. 71(1):39-46).<br>
This protocol was reviewed and approved by an IRB board from University of Montreal.<br>
The WOMAC was administered to subjects preferably in the doctor"s office. They<br>
were asked to read and respond to a questionnaire on their own or via proxy in the waiting<br>
room of the doctor"s office or were interviewed by project personnel over the telephone<br>
and the data were transcribed in the computer database. This offered a stable environment<br>
among patients and reduced the possibility of bias due to different home environments<br>
among patients. Between groups differences for all measurements were evaluated with<br>
One-Way Analysis of Variance and Tukey"s Least Significant Difference for multiple<br>
comparisons. All questions were assigned a weight from 0 to 4 depending on the severity<br>
of pain, stiffness or impaired function. These values were then converted to percentages<br>
normalized to 100 and reported as WOMAC scores. Higher values are indicative of<br>
greater impairment. Table 12 sets forth the mean WOMAC index scores for pain, stiffness<br>
and function for 250 mg and 500 mg per day Univestin™ compared to celecoxib at 200 mg<br>
per day and the placebo before treatment (baseline) and at 30, 60 and 90 days after<br>
treatment. The lower the score, the less pain and stiffness and better function a patient has.<br>
Table 13 sets forth the mean absolute change in WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness<br>
and function. They are expressed as the difference between the baseline and the scores<br>
given at 30, 60 and 90 days. The more negative the score, the greater the improvement.<br>
It is very difficult to ascribe a standard deviation to a group mean in a clinic trial<br>
due to the severe differences that appear in the data. Rather, confidence limits for the<br>
mean are preferred because they give a lower and upper limit for the mean and the<br>
narrower the interval, the more precise the estimate of the mean. Confidence limits are<br>
expressed in terms of a confidence coefficient. A 95% confidence interval is the most<br>
commonly used interval to describe a mean in this type of statistical analysis. This does<br>
not imply that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains the true mean. Instead,<br>
the level of confidence is associated with the method of calculating the interval. The<br>
confidence coefficient is simply the proportion of samples of a given size that may be<br>
expected to contain the true mean. That is, for a 95% confidence interval, if many samples<br>
are collected and the confidence interval computed, in the long run about 95% of these<br>
intervals would contain the true mean. With this in mind, the 95% confidence interval was<br>
computed for the WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness and function at 30, 60 and 90 days.<br>
Raw / non standardized scores for the WOMAC scores based on a five point Likert<br>
scale with a range between 1 and 5 were chosen to represent the final pain, stiffness and<br>
impaired function indices (Figures 20-31). Standardization to a scale between 0 and 100<br>
was used in other sections for uniformity (see Tables 12 and 13) and to enhance the<br>
appreciation of the magnitudes of changes. However, given that all the figures are based<br>
on the same 1-5 point scales the raw data were plotted since they more accurately reflect<br>
the methods by which these scores were obtained from the patient questionnaires. In other<br>
words, since the patients were given a choice between 1 and 5 these representations better<br>
reflect the patient"s response as opposed to the standardized or transformed score of 0 -100<br>
that does not reflect the patient"s perception of possible range of answers.<br>
Clear trends exist showing that for the pain indice that Univestin™ at 250 and 500<br>
mg/day reduced pain over the 90 day treatment period based on the patient responses.<br>
Celecoxib also reduces pain over this same period of time compared to the placebo, which<br>
does not. However, celecoxib does not seem to be as effective as Univestin™ at both<br>
dosages in reducing stiffness, since the confidence intervals heavily overlapped those of<br>
the placebo. Finally, Univestin™ at both doses clearly improved functional impairment,<br>
but celecoxib does not compared to placebo. The graphic representations contain all<br>
subjects even if they did not complete the study. Each confidence interval, however, is<br>
valid based on the number of subjects that were present at the time the WOMAC tests<br>
were taken so the trends still hold. These data are plotted in Figures 20 through 31.<br>
Example 21. Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy of Free-B-ring Flavonoids and Flavans<br>
on BMI and Weight Loss Due to an Increase in Function.<br>
Additional measurements taken during the clinical trial were height and weight.<br>
All subjects in all groups (see Example 20) were measured for height and weight at 30 and<br>
90 days of treatment. The subjects were given no recommendations on diet or exercise in<br>
order not to bias the results toward reduction of BMI and weight loss. Table 14 illustrates<br>
the changes in weight and BMI that occurred after treatment for 30 and 90 days.<br>
Based on these data, the 250 mg/day dose of Univestin™ gave the greatest amount<br>
of weight loss and change in BMI followed by the 500 mg/day dose of Univestin™ and<br>
then celecoxib. The placebo had no effect on weight or BMI.<br>
It is not believed that there are any other reports in the literature of anti-<br>
inflammatory compounds being used to effect weight loss or changes in BMI. Though the<br>
subjects were given no advice on exercise, the greater functional capabilities gained after<br>
treatment, especially with Univestin™, may have allowed them to exercise more on their<br>
own accord. Alternatively, Univestin™ may be increasing thermogenesis, lipolysis, or<br>
causing an under utilization of carbohydrates or fat in the diet. Figures 32 and 33 illustrate<br>
the BMI and weight loss seen for Univestin™ after 30 and 90 days of treatment.<br>
Example 22. Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy of Free-B-ring Flavonoids and Flavans<br>
on Lowering of Blood Glucose Due to an Increase in Function.<br>
Blood glucose was also taken at 0 (baseline), 30 days and 90 days after treatment<br>
(see Example 20). These measurements were reported in mmole per liter. The data is also<br>
shown in mg/dL. Table 15 sets forth blood glucose levels after 30 and 90 days of<br>
treatment with Univestin™ at 250 and 500 mg/day.<br>
These data suggest that both the 250 and the 500 mg/day doses of Univestin™ are<br>
significantly lowering blood glucose levels over time. This impact may or may not be<br>
related to the loss of weight observed above or to the presumed increase in activity as<br>
functional impairment improved. It may also be possible that Univestin™ is acting directly<br>
to improve glucose metabolism by decreasing glucose tolerance or by utilizing<br>
carbohydrates more effectively.<br>
