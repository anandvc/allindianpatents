There are several prior arts related to the anti-fungal N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-naphthaIenemethanamine hydrochloride. WO2001EP00562 20000120 (EP 1259261), describes a pharmaceutical composition comprising of solid oral dosage forms of the compound and its rapid disintegration along with taste masking preparations. WO0211764 describes a topical application of the above drug using the laser beam technique for the treatment of fungus infection. WO 01/54675 A2 describes a pharmaceutical composition of the compound in emulsifiable or self-emulsifying oral formulations. WO 02/078648 A2 describes the topical application of the compound along with a second drug viz., Diclofenac or Indomethacin for the treatment of fungal infections.<br>
US 19970952288, PCT/EP96/02022, WO96/35423 uses a combination of N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethanamine hydrochloride and a-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)- α-(lH-I,2,4-triazole-l-ylmethyI)-lH-l,2,4-triazoIe-l-ethanoi to treat resistant strains of mycoses.<br>
WO 01/95890 A2 describes the oral administration of a pharmaceutical composition of N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethanamine hydrochloride comprising of Sustained Release dosage form.<br>
The above state-of-art clearly reveal the continuing need for anti-fungal compositions for various end uses / applications such as oral, parenteral and topical. However, all such known forms of anti-fungal formulations presently available are found to involve complex manufacturing technique which make its difficult and cost-extensive to obtain.<br>
In particular, anti-fungal such as α-(2,4-Difluoropheny 1)- α-( 1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ylmethyl)-lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-ethanol required to treat widely rampant and menacing infections caused due to mycoses has limitations in its use as the known methods of its preparation   do not allow the compound to be solubilized in higher strengths for the<br><br>
3<br>
therapeutic purpose as the solubility of α-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)- α-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-<br>
ylmethyl)-lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-ethanoI in saline is at a maximum of about 8 mg/ml leading<br>
to difficulties in formulating preparations.	~*	'<br>
Likewise the other well known anti-fungal N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethanamine- hydrochloride, an allylamine anti-fungal agent, has an inherent limited aqueous solubility of about ~6mg/ml. An emulsion form is known to be used along with a vehicle but this form has an inherent drawback viz., of limited solubility in aqueous media thus making it difficult to be easily formulated.<br>
To overcome the drug resistance problems and achieve proper therapeutic compliance the anti-fungal actives such as α-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)- α-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-ylmethyl)-lH-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanolandN-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-<br>
naphthalenemethanamine- hydrochloride is required in higher concentrations which cannot be provided due to limitations in solubility of the said α-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)- α-(lH-1,2,4-triazole-1-y lmethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol and N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-<br>
hepten4-ynyl]-N-methyl-1 -naphthalenemethanamine- hydrochloride.<br>
Also the existing formulation of α-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)-α-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-ylmethyl)-lH-l,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol is only available in the form of tablet/capsule requiring cumbersome powder technology to prepare the same. Some references show that the suspension preparation is administered orally by crushing the tablet and mixing the same with fruit juice to overcome the taste or the infusion is filled in the syringe for the oral application.<br>
However, the formulation of tablet and low concentration infusion poses difficulty for the proper administration in case of debilated and pediatric/geriatric patients. These patients often shows poor drug compliance<br>
There is thus need in the art to provide anti-fungal formulations such as α-(2,4-Difluoropheny 1)- α-( 1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ethanol and N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethanamine- hydrochloride with high concentrations of actives which would avoid problems of drug resistance and also favour effective treatment of fungal infections such as mycotic infections.<br>
Also in view of the widespread fungal infections especially mycotic infections prevailing in tropical and under developed countries there is an ever increasing demand for such anti¬fungal compositions which would be simple to obtain at affordable and cost-effective rates and at the same time suitable for oral, parenteral and local/topical administration for treating wide range of fungal/mycotic infections.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for anti -fungal pharmaceutical compositions which would be simple and cost effective to obtain and serve as effective anti -fungal formulations to treat/eradicate various fungal/mycotic infections.<br><br>
4<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple and cost effective anti-fungal formulation, which would be simple to manufacture but would serve as a good anti -fungal preparations with good bio-availability and patient compliance.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide a solution to the much required readily obtainable anti -fungal preparation, which would be safe and suitable for oral, parenteral as well as topical administration.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide simple and cost-effective anti -fungal formulations suitable for oral, parenteral and topical application, which would be storage, stable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

It is surprisingly found by way of the present invention that anti-fungal agents such as β-(2,4-DifIuorophenyl)-α-( 1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ethanol and N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethanamine-hydrochloride can be effectively solubilized by the use of the selected carrier 2,5-di-O-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol and its derivatives.<br>
The above pharmaceutical composition of the invention resolves all the existing difficulties in the preparation of anti-fungal compositions through a simple technology, whereby anti¬fungal compounds, which are otherwise difficult to solubilize can be selectively solubilized to be easily prepared in various formulations.<br>
This, therefore, unexpectedly provides for the much desired simple and cost-effective pharmaceutical composition for wide range of anti-fungal application.<br>
It is found by way of the present invention that various anti-fungal preparations such as of α-(2,4-Difluoropheny l)-α-( 1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1 -ethanol and N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl]-N-methyl-l-naphthalenemethanamine hydrochloride in the form of injectables, tablets, oral liquids, pessaries, suppositories, gels, lotions, sprays and ear or eye drops could be formulated using 2,5-di-O-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol and its derivatives as solvents in an appropriate proportions for treating fungal infections found in animals including mammals.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the anti-fungal composition of the invention comprising:<br>
providing at least one anti-fungal agent selected from anti -fungal azoles, anti-fungal allylamines, anti-fungal hydroxy pyridines and anti-fungal polymers in a selective carrier media comprising at least one of 2,5-di-O-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol and its derivatives.<br>
In particular, the formulations can be prepared by dissolving at least one of said anti-fungal<br>
agents such as atleast one of a-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)- α-(lH-l,2,4-triazole-l-ylmethyl)- 1H-<br>
1,2,4-triazole-l-ethanol;	and     N-[(2E)-6,6-Dimethyl-2-hepten-4ynyl]-N-methyl-l-<br>
naphthalenemethanamine hydrochloride in the selective carrier 2,5-di-O-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol or its derivatives.<br>
Alternatively the pharmaceutical composition of the invention in solution form can be added to formulate tablets containing excipients such as starch or lactose or may be directly filled in capsules, alone or with suitable excipient/s, or in the form of drops or suspension containing flavouring or coloring agents or directly for parenteral administration.<br><br>
6<br>
