				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing plantation white sugar and refined sugar simultaneously from sugar cane.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is known that plantation white sugar has a colour value of about 100-120 I .U. in comparison to that of refined sugar which has a colour value of less than 45 I. U.<br>
The process for producing plantation white sugar consists in crushing cane to produce juice, which is subjected to the step of purification by addition of sulphur and milk of lime. Such a treated juice is subjected to the step of evaporation to produce a syrup. The syrup is sulphated and then subjected to a first step of crystallization followed by centrifugation to produce a mother liquor and plantation white sugar. The mother liquor is subjected to a second step of crystallization and centrifugation to produce B sugar and B molasses. The B sugar is recycled to the first step of crystallization, and the B molasses is subjected to a third step of crystallization and centrifugation to produce C sugar and C molasses. The C sugar is washed in a set of centrifugals and is recycled to the first step of crystallization. The 'C' wash is recycled to C massecuite.<br>
The step for producing refined sugar having a colour value of less than 45 I.U. consists in processing raw sugar to produce a melt by dissolving in water, and treating the solution with chemicals such as carbondioxide, colour precipitant, phosphoric acid and milk of lime. The treated melt is decolourised through an ion exchange column and/or active carbon treatment to produce a fine melt and then subjected to the step of crystallization. The raw sugar which has a colour value of approximately 1000 I.U. is used as starting material for producing refined sugar. The raw sugar is produced by adopting procedure as for plantation white sugar but without the use of sulphur.<br>
As will be apparent, the known processes produced essentially only plantation white sugar which had a high colour value of 100-120 I.U. or refined sugar with a low colour value of less than 45 I.U.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a novel process for simultaneous production of plantation white sugar and refined sugar.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for production of plantation white sugar and refined sugar, which is an efficient and simple process.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>

(j) recycling the C2R refined molasses thus obtained to step ( c) above;<br>
There are distinct advantages which ensue from the process of the present invention. One such advantage is that the process allows the production of plantation white sugar as well as refined sugar. Yet another disadvantage is that raw sugar used as the starting material for production of refined sugar is obtained from the process stream of plantation white sugar. Yet another advantage is that the mill for producing plantation white sugar need not be<br>
substantially modified, except for the addition thereto of certain additional apparatuses for producing refined sugar.<br>
