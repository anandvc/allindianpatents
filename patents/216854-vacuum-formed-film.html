				<td>VACUUM FORMED FILM TOPSHEETS HAVING A SILKY TACTULE <br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO EARLIER APPLICATIONS<br>
This patent application claims priority from United States Patent Application<br>
No. 09/876,440, filed on June 6, 2001 entitled "VACUUM FORMED FILM<br>
TOPSHEETS HAVING A SILKY TACTILE IMPRESSION".<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to disposable absorbent products. More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to an apertured, vacuum formed film having properties that<br>
give the film a silky tactile impression or silky feel when the film is stroked by a user.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Advances in film forming technology have yielded improvements in disposable<br>
absorbent products such as disposable diapers, feminine hygiene products and the like.<br>
"Film" is a common term for thermoplastic polymer webs made from any variety of<br>
processes. The most common method of producing films is with an extrusion process.<br>
Cast extrusion and blown extrusion are commonly known methods in the film<br>
producing industry. In a blown extrusion process, a circular die extrudes an inflated<br>
bubble of film that is cooled by cool air streams blown onto the bubble"s perimeter by an<br>
air ring. The bubble is then flattened in a nip and subsequently slit into flat sheets that can<br>
then be reheat embossed or otherwise manipulated. Blown film can be used to create a<br>
roll of precursor film that may be fed into a reheat vacuum formed film (VFF) process.<br>
This method is taught by United States patent 4,151,240 to Lucas. Additionally, it is also<br>
known to use a precursor roll of cast film.<br>
In a cast extrusion process, a flat web is extruded from a slot die. The flat web is<br>
subsequently cooled and set by a variety of chilling roller means. As an example, United<br>
States patent 4,456,570 to Thomas teaches a cast extrusion in a direct melt vacuum<br>
formed film (VFF) process. In a vacuum formed film process, a pressure differential is<br>
applied across a forming screen. In the case of a direct melt VFF process, a molten web<br>
is extruded onto a forming area of a forming screen. An example of a direct melt VFF<br>
process is taught by United States patent 4,456,570 to Thomas. United States patent<br>
4,151,240 to Lucas teaches reheating and partially melting a web while the web is over<br>
the forming area of the forming screen. A melted polymer is desirable to form three-<br>
dimensional apertures since a melted polymer is more easily sucked into the apertures in<br>
a forming screen. Both USPN 4,456,570 to Thomas and USPN 4,151,240 to Lucas teach<br>
primarily using vacuum as a main source of pressure differential energy that is used for<br>
the work energy that changes a two dimensional web into a three dimensional cell and<br>
causes an aperture to open in a film web. During the formation of a VFF, the polymer<br>
of the film typically undergoes a phase change from molten state in a flat form to a<br>
crystalline state in the new three dimensional form.<br>
In some cases, it is desirable to form textures on the lands of the VFF. To form<br>
textures on the lands of the vacuum formed film, lands are provided on the forming screen<br>
with textures provided thereon. The textures on the forming screen are then incorporated<br>
into the direct melt VFF film. Due to vacuum pressure, textures form on the lands of the<br>
subsequently formed VFF. As discussed above, the vacuum pressure differential also<br>
causes 3-D cells with apertures to be formed in the film.<br>
The textures imparted on the VFF may be formed in a pattern. Examples of<br>
embossing patterns include straight lines, pyramids, diamonds, squares, and random matte.<br>
Further, more exotic patterns may be used including, exotic squiggly lines, spiral pattens,<br>
microscopic flower petals, and other ornamental designs.<br>
A micropattem can also be incorporated into a precursor film by a reheat VFF<br>
process, via either cast embossing or blown embossing processes that are well known in<br>
the industry and that are discussed above. In a reheat process, external heat is applied to<br>
partially melt and form three dimensional cells with apertures. Portions of the precursor<br>
film rest on the lands of the screen, which partially protects these portions of the precursor<br>
film from the heat. Therefore, only the portion of the film suspended over an opening of<br>
a cell in the forming screen is fully unprotected from exposure to heat. Thus, the<br>
suspended portion becomes melted and forms a three dimensional cell with an aperture.<br>
When a film layer is applied to a forming screen, the film layer typically has about<br>
25 to 80 times less mass than a metallic screen mass beneath the film layer. Because of<br>
the mass ratio of the film layer to the screen, the screen acts as a "heat sink" in the land<br>
area where the precursor film is in intimate contact with the lands of the forming screen.<br>
The heat passes through the thin film and is absorbed by the screen such that no, or<br>
negligible, thermal distortion occurs on the land regions. As a result, any texturizing<br>
pattern embossed into the precursor film is maintained in the finished VFF.<br>
Films produced by the methods above may be constructed of various materials<br>
having a selected mesh count, embossed thickness, a selected aperture pattern, a selected<br>
width of the lands or spaces between the apertures, and a selected pattern may be formed<br>
on the lands. The "mesh count" is the number of cells aligned in 2.54 cm (one inch) of<br>
distance. Other variations may also be possible. Each configuration will exhibit distinct<br>
properties with respect to performance.<br>
When measuring a VFF for percent open area, it is common to use any of the<br>
many computerized video devices that are available. The video camera, via magnification<br>
and contrast, can discern the openings from the lands and digitize the data to calculate the<br>
percent open area.<br>
Unlike nonwoven material (NW), which exhibits capillary action for wicking<br>
fluids, formed films are made from polymer webs that do not transmit fluid unless the<br>
formed film is "formed" into a three-dimensional apertured sheet. Formed films may be<br>
tested for rewet. A lower rewet value is more desirable. Generally, preferred products<br>
have had a rewet value of less than one gram; i.e. a "fractional gram". It has been found<br>
that products with a gram or more of rewet are typically viewed by consumers as being<br>
wet or damp in use.<br>
Fluid acquisition rate is also critical to a functional topsheet. If the fluid<br>
acquisition rate is too slow, then a product using the topsheet may leak. The fluid<br>
acquisition rate is affected by several factors. The surface energy of the vacuum formed<br>
film is critical for fluid acquisition rate. Additionally, the fluid acquisition rate is directly<br>
correlated to open area. Additionally, the "loft", or the required spacial distance between<br>
a fluid containing absorbent core and the skin of the user, must also have a certain<br>
measure to prevent a wetness factor of one gram or greater as exhibited by rewet values.<br>
Simply stated, if there are relatively large openings, as indicated by high % open area, and<br>
comparatively little separation space, as indicated by low loft, then fluid can overcome<br>
the short expanse of space through the center of the large opening, which results in<br>
reverse flow, or "rewet".<br>
Table 1, below, is derived from selected feminine napkin products from around the<br>
world that use a formed film coversheet. From the data in Table 1, the ratio correlation<br>
can be seen. From such data, the apparent line of separation of the loft to % open area<br>
ratio (L/OA Ratio) between a "dry" coversheet and "damp" coversheet would logically<br>
The term "rewet" implies that all of the fluid passes through the topsheet and then<br>
only the fluid coming back to the surface to "rewet" it is measured. However, with the<br>
many varieties of micro-embossing, crimping, and punching involved with these materials,<br>
often "wells" can be formed that trap fluid on the surface. The entrapped fluid accounts<br>
for about 15% of variation in the data. Also, as with any reliable test method, the method<br>
itself will have some variation of results, even within a given single material. This is<br>
offered to explain why the correlation is not exactly linear as, in theory, it should be.<br>
Hole diameter is determined by the narrowest width of an aperture (specifically<br>
for aperturing oval or elliptical shapes) that can be determined as a function of mesh count<br>
and land width. From mesh count and land width, one can derive an approximate hole<br>
diameter, or span of the "supports" for the polymer sheet to be apertured.<br>
A hole diameter of a typically known 60 mesh forming screen is usually no more<br>
than 200mm. Since a reasonable amount of metal must remain between holes in a forming<br>
screen (such that it will be robust enough to run in the VFF process), one can calculate<br>
hole diameter as follows. As explained above, "mesh" is the number of cells aligned in<br>
one inch of distance; hence, 2.54cm/60 = 425mm (1/60 =.017 inch) center to center. One<br>
will need about 230,mm of metal land area to have a robust screen, leaving the nominal<br>
200 mm hole diameter for a 60 mesh pattern.<br>
In addition to rewet performance and fluid acquisition performance during use, it<br>
has been found that the feel or tactile impression of a topsheet is important to consumers.<br>
Silk has been known for centuries to impart a unique and highly desirable tactile<br>
impression that has no other description than to say, "This feels silky". The term "silky"<br>
alone provides enough description for average global consumers to grasp its meaning and<br>
recognize whether or not a product feels "silky" or merely soft and clothlike. In repeated<br>
blind panel tests various fabrics such as felt, flannel, cotton diapers, polyester/cotton<br>
clothing fabric, wool, and silk were tested. The panels easily discern a silky tactile<br>
impression (STI) of silk cloth over the other cloth materials.<br>
For many years, the feminine napkin market has been segmented into women who<br>
prefer a nonwoven coversheet and women who prefer a film coversheet. The market<br>
segmentation is particularly found in westernized countries. Those who prefer the<br>
nonwoven type seem to prefer the clothlike tactile impression and the perceived "comfort"<br>
that they derive from it.<br>
Users of the nonwoven type, however, sacrifice the dry cleanliness of the VFF<br>
type. Nonwovens have capillarity due to having their many fibers in close proximity to<br>
the absorbent core. Capillarity is good for transmitting fluid through a coversheet via the<br>
capillary action of the nonwoven. Unfortunately, "wicking" by capillary action can also<br>
act in reverse. Therefore, nonwovens are not known for providing good rewet values.<br>
A good rewet value is indicative of dry cleanliness during use.<br>
Those who prefer the film type seem to prefer the improved cleanliness and anti-<br>
rewet, particularly that of the VFFs. Many VFF coversheets have large openings which<br>
readily accept semi-coagulated matter found in menses. VFFs also provide the afore-<br>
mentioned prevention of the fluid rewetting to the top plane of the film. The prevention<br>
of rewet is derived from the superior loft of the VFF material. Hence, those who prefer<br>
the prior art film type forgo a bit of clothlike tactile impression derived from the presence<br>
of fibers of a nonwoven to achieve the cleanliness, which is especially true of a VFF. A<br>
film that delivers the perceived comfort of a nonwoven with the improved cleanliness and<br>
anti-rewet is desirable. Therefore, much effort has been made in attempts to derive the<br>
benefits of both types, some with market success; however, no VFF to date has delivered<br>
both the cleanliness and a silky tactile impression.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a vacuum formed film that delivers desirable rewet<br>
properties and possesses a desirable silky tactile impression or silky feel to a user. In one<br>
embodiment, the vacuum formed film has a plurality of cells, wherein the cells are ellipse<br>
shaped, each having a major axis and minor axis. In another embodiment, the cells are<br>
boat shaped, wherein the ends on each end of the major axis are rounded off. In another<br>
embodiment the cells may be oval shaped. Major axes of the cells are aligned in the<br>
stroking direction of the vacuum formed film. The cells define stroking direction lands<br>
and a transverse direction lands in areas between the cells. In one embodiment, the<br>
stroking direction lands are raised with respect to said transverse direction lands. In yet<br>
another embodiment, micro-ridges are formed on the lands for imparting a silky feel to the<br>
vacuum formed film. The various film aspects, above, each contribute to the silky tactile<br>
impression of the film. In still further embodiments, some or all of the various aspects<br>
described above may be combined to achieve a further improved silky tactile impression.<br>
The loft to open area ratio of the vacuum formed film is preferably greater than about 9<br>
and preferably has a rewet of less than about 1 gram.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Both direct melt and reheat processes are, in this invention, considered to be<br>
equivalent methods under the term vacuum formed films (VFF). Since both melt, form,<br>
and recrystallize in a three dimensional shape, each of the processes may be used to form<br>
films wherein the loft of the cells are robust. Polymer webs have a property known as<br>
"memory" wherein a polymer web will tend to revert to its original shape. Therefore, if<br>
a polymer web is formed as a flat web and then forced into a three dimensional shape<br>
without undergoing melting and recrystallizing, the polymer web will try to revert again<br>
to its original flat shape when any stresses are subsequently applied. Robustness in the<br>
third dimension is critical for obtaining and then maintaining "loft", which prevents rewet.<br>
Two important variables are commonly discussed when describing a VFF, loft and<br>
% AO. "Loft" is defined as the top to bottom thickness of the vacuum formed film, which<br>
is typically the required spacial distance between a fluid containing absorbent core and the<br>
skin of the user or the thickness of the vacuum formed film. Loft is typically measured by<br>
the same means used to measure "Embossed Thickness" in the polymer film industry.<br>
Embossment is merely imparting a third dimension to the film, typically one with defined<br>
pattern and shape. Commonly used devices for this measurement are called "Low Load<br>
Micrometers". A wide area of displacement with a low compression load is utilized to<br>
insure one is measuring the full depth of pattern and one is not compressing the pattern<br>
to render a false reading. A TMI® Model 49-70 manufactured by Testing Machines, Inc.<br>
of Amityville, NY was used for the loft measurements herein. This relationship oi<br>
properties ties directly to rewet performance and is a simple calculation of dividing loft,<br>
as measured in micrometers (mm), by the percent open area (17.3%, for example). As an<br>
example, a packing of 60 mesh round holes on a square pattern packing array, has a<br>
percent open area (OA%) that can be calculated as follows:<br>
SI Units:<br>
OA%={((mesh x mesh [due to square array]) x area of each hole, in cm)-+(2.54cm)2} X 100<br>
A 60 mesh hole is 200mm in diameter, 200mm / 10,000mm/cm = 0.02 cm diameter<br>
D/2=Radius; hence, Radius (R) = 0.02cm/2 = 0.01 cm<br>
Area = tcR2 = 3.14159 x (0.01cm)2 = 0.00031cm2<br>
mesh x mesh = 60 X 60 = 3600<br>
-{( 3600 x (0.00031cm2 )H (2.54cm)2} x 100 = 17.3% Open Area<br>
US Units:<br>
OA%={((mesh x mesh [due to square array]) x area of each hole, in inches) + 1 inch2} X 10C<br>
A 60 mesh hole is 200mm in diameter, 200mm /( 25,400mm/inch) = 0.00787 inch diameter<br>
D/2=Radius; hence, Radius (R) = 0.00787inch/2 = 0.0039 inch<br>
Area = R2= 3.14159 x (0.0039 inch)2= 4.8xlO5 inch2<br>
mesh x mesh = 60 X 60 = 3600<br>
{( 3600 x (4.8 x 10"3inch2)) 1 inch2} x 100 = 17.3% Open Area<br>
Fof this invention it has been surprisingly discovered that by a combination of<br>
pattern, plane and texture, a VFF providing adequate "loft to % open area ratio" for<br>
achieving good rewet values can also attain a desirable silky tactile impression (STI).<br>
It has been discovered that STI may be improved by selecting a specific range of<br>
mesh count from about 28 to 60, preferably 40. If fewer cells exist, it has been found that<br>
users can begin to sense the individuality of cells, which can detract from the STI effect.<br>
The STI may be further improved with an oval boat shaped or elliptical cell having a<br>
major axis to minor axis ratio of at least about 1.05; 1.0 to as much as about 6.5:1, more<br>
preferably ranging from about 1.5:1 to 4:1. The STI may be still further improved by<br>
aligning all the major axes substantially in the same direction. For purposes of this<br>
application, the stroking direction (SD) shall be defined as the direction along a length of<br>
an end product, e.g., feminine napkin or the like. Figure 1 shows sample product 5.<br>
Arrow 7 shows the stroking direction. The stroking direction is typically the direction<br>
that a consumer strokes the material when assessing the film. It is desirable to align the<br>
stroking direction in a direction most likely to rub back and forth against a user during<br>
use, i.e. typically in a front to back orientation. By implementing the above steps, a<br>
discernable panel test result may be achieved for STI as compared to other VFF topsheets<br>
and synthetic silk-like nonwoven materials previously known in the art.<br>
Further, it is commonly understood by those skilled in the art that the "machine<br>
direction" (MD) is the processing direction when manufacturing formed films, and with<br>
rare exception, when converting the formed film as a topsheet on an absorptive device.<br>
The MD is the direction where the web of the material(s) moves continuously down a<br>
machine. As it relates to the forming screens, the MD is the circumference of the screen<br>
and the "Transverse Direction" (TD) is from the end to end length of the screen. As is<br>
commonly understood, the forming screen rotates around a stationary seal. Therefore,<br>
the circumferential direction is the direction of continuous motion feeding film down the<br>
machine in the "Machine Direction". While not typical or commonly used, alterations<br>
from this norm will be understood by a man of the art; therefore, these are not intended<br>
as limiting to this invention.<br>
On most conversion lines that take the VFF and place it as a topsheet, diapers or<br>
pads or bandages or whatever absorptive device is being manufactured will align the MD<br>
of topsheet down the length, or greatest dimension, of the product. Especially for<br>
feminine napkins, the difference of length to width is significant. In many tests when<br>
napkins are handed to women, they will typically stroke the topsheet down the length of<br>
the product as shown in Figure 1. Consequently, it is generally the case that the stroking<br>
direction is synonymous with the machine direction, although this need not be the case to<br>
fall within the scope of the applicant"s invention. For a consumer, the first perceptive<br>
triggers are gained by stroking the topsheet in the fashion described above when a<br>
consumer desires to know how the product will feel in use.<br>
The length is also aligned with the anatomy of common disposable articles. Since<br>
disposable articles are typically held in the groin between the legs there is little chance of<br>
side to side or TD motion. If the product shifts during the natural motions of the user, the<br>
shift will almost always occur in the MD creating a "stroking" action of the topsheet<br>
against the skin. As explained above, and from all these correlated factors it can be seen<br>
that the term "MD" and "SD" are typically synonymous. The STI effect is gained by a<br>
stroking motion. Hence, the reference to the "Stroking Direction" (SD).<br>
For purposes of this application, the term "oval" shall relate to a rounded shape<br>
with a major and minor axis whose lines along the major axis direction are essentially<br>
curved. The term "ellipse" shall differ in that the lines along the major axis direction are<br>
essentially straight. Hereafter, the ratio of major axes to minor axes shall be referred to<br>
as the SD:TD ratio wherein SD is the stroking direction"s alignment of the major axes, and<br>
TD is the transverse direction of the minor axes. Although not essential for achieving the<br>
STI effect, it has been found that the STI effect is enhanced if the centers of major axes<br>
are commonly aligned with each other.<br>
Again, while not essential for attaining STI effect, the STI effect may be further<br>
enhanced if the lands in the SD are on a slightly higher plane than the lands in the TD.<br>
Also, the STI can be triggered with this step alone. If SD lands are in a slightly higher<br>
plane, higher STI rankings are received when compared to single plane material of the<br>
same configuration. It has been found that as little as 15mm variance shows a slight<br>
distinction, although a 35mm variance is preferred. If a film has greater than a 145mm -<br>
variance between the SD lands and the TD lands, then problems can occur with the<br>
strength of the forming screen, especially in the case of finer mesh counts. Winding<br>
issues, such as roll blocking due to nesting, may be introduced, as well. Since the SD<br>
lands are raised, it is less critical to have rounded cell geometries. Many polygonal shapes<br>
will also function, such as squares, hexagons, pentagons or other shapes.<br>
The variance in the height of the planes of the SD land plane and the TD land<br>
plane can be achieved by machining a forming screen with cutting tools, grinding, etching,<br>
cutting with energy beams, or affixing wires to alter the external profile of the screen to<br>
form bi-planar lands. Additionally, other means may be used for varying the height of SD<br>
lands.<br>
Also non-essential, but preferred, for increasing the STI effect is the addition of<br>
various texturizations to the lands. More preferred is the addition of micro-ridges (MR)<br>
of a specific height and spacing. Films having micro-ridges received surprisingly high<br>
panel test recognition of STI when the micro-ridges were applied to films having mesh<br>
counts of 28 or greater and especially to films having a 40 Hex pattern. To form micro-<br>
ridge patterns, the pattern is typically etched into the land areas of the screen. The micro-<br>
ridges will readily form on the lands of the film, so long as there remains a direct pathway<br>
of air evacuation in the spaces between the ridges. The air evacuation requirement applies<br>
to all patterns intended for texturization of the lands of the film. If the molten film lays<br>
over a cavity and forms a seal around a perimeter of the cavity, thereby sealing off an air<br>
evacuation pathway, the film will be prevented from being suctioned into micro-pattern<br>
depressions. Consequently, the film will be prevented from conforming to the shape of<br>
the micro-pattern depressions.<br>
Ail or some of these features and enhancements, e.g, commonly aligned centers<br>
of major axes, elevated SD lands, and micro-ridges, may be combined to create a VFF<br>
material that will exhibit an STI effect among a majority of panelists assembled to test<br>
product. Other important aspects are maintaining the adequate VFF aperture diameter<br>
and product quality for transmission of fluids through the topsheet and into the absorbent<br>
core (especially the more viscous menses fluid), as well as maintaining the desired "loft<br>
to % open area ratio" of the VFF such that good rewet values are achievable.<br>
Additionally, it has been shown that a preferred range of mesh count can<br>
contribute to the desired STI. As stated above, mesh count is the number of cells aligned<br>
in 2.54 cm (one inch) of length. The higher the mesh count, the greater the number of<br>
cells that are packed together. The lower the mesh count, the fewer the number of cells in<br>
a given linear measure and/or square area. Cells or three-dimensional apertures may be<br>
patterned in any of a variety of arrays that are conducive to the desired objectives. Once<br>
an array is chosen, cells can then be counted per 2.54 cm (one inch) of length to<br>
determine "mesh".<br>
Referring now to Figure 1A, a section of forming screen 10, which exhibits an<br>
oriented ellipse pattern is shown. In the preferred pattern, ellipse shaped cells or apertures<br>
12 have a major axis 14 and a minor axis 16. The major axis 14 is aligned in the machine<br>
direction (MD), which is indicated by arrow 18. The transverse direction (TD), is<br>
indicated by arrow 20. In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of lengths of major axis 14 to<br>
minor axis 16, i.e., "SD:TD" is about 3:1. Preferably, all major axes 14 are aligned with<br>
each other and are aligned in the machine direction 18. Additionally, all minor axes 16<br>
are correspondingly aligned in the TD 20. Areas between cells 12 are SD lands 22 and<br>
TD lands 24.<br>
 Referring now to Figure IB, a cross-section of forming screen 10 is shown taken<br>
along line 2-2 of Figure 1A. Figure IB is an embodiment of forming screen 10 wherein<br>
SD land 22 is on a higher plane than TD land 24. The SD lands may be seen more clearly<br>
in Figure 1C, which is a cross section of forming screen 10 taken along lines 1C-1C of<br>
Figure 1A.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 2A, a section of forming screen 10", which exhibits an<br>
oriented ellipse pattern is shown. In the preferred pattern, ellipse shaped cells or apertures<br>
12" have a major axis 14" and a minor axis 16". The major axis 14" is aligned in the<br>
machine direction (MD), which is indicated by arrow 18". In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
ratio of lengths of major axis 14" to minor axis 16", i.e., "SD:TD" is about 3:1. Preferably,<br>
all major axes 14" are aligned with each other and are aligned in the machine direction 18.<br>
Additionally, all minor axes 16" are correspondingly aligned in the TD 20. Areas between<br>
cells 12" are SD lands 22" and TD lands 24".<br>
Referring now to Figure 2B, a cross-section of forming screen 10" taken along<br>
lines 2B-2B is shown. Figure 2B depicts an embodiment wherein an upper surface of SD<br>
301and 22" and TD land 24" are in the same plane. The SD lands may be seen more clearly<br>
in Figure 2C, which is a cross-section of forming screen 10" taken along lines 2C-2C<br>
of Figure 2B.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, a single plane VFF 26 is shown. VFF 26 is<br>
produced from a forming screen having an elliptical pattern with MD alignment of the<br>
5major axes 28 of cells 30. The pattern shown in Figure 3 is a 40 mesh pattern when<br>
counting cells in the TD. Apertures 30 of vacuum formed film 26 measures about<br>
750um in the SD or major axis 28 direction and about 250um in the TD or minor axis<br>
32 direction. The thickness of the cells, which are from top to bottom of the three-<br>
dimensional cells 30, i.e, loft, is about 345mm. The VFF 26 has an open area of<br>
1014.5%. Therefore, the loft to % open area ratio of the VFF 26 is about 24. The VFF<br>
26 has a rewet value of .08 grams. The variance between the upper surface of the SD<br>
lands 34 and the TD lands 36 in the bi-planar material 26 is about 20mm.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, a multi-plane VFF 38 is shown wherein the highest<br>
plane is the upper surface of the SD lands 40. VFF 38 is produced from a forming<br>
screen having an elliptical pattern with MD alignment of the major axes 42 of cells<br>
43. The pattern shown in Figure 6 is a 40 mesh pattern. Cells 43 of vacuum formed<br>
film 38 measure about 750mm in the SD or major axis 42 direction and about 250mm<br>
in the TD or minor axis 44 direction. The thickness of the apertures 43, which are<br>
from top to bottom of the three-dimensional cells 43, i.e, loft, is about 345mm. The<br>
VFF 38 has an open area of 14.5%. Therefore, the loft to % open area ratio of the<br>
VFF 38 is about 24. The VFF 38 has a rewet value of 0.08 grams. The variance<br>
between the upper surface of the SD lands 40 and the TD lands 46 in the bi-planar<br>
material 38 is about 20mm.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5A and 5B, Figures 5A and 5B show another<br>
embodiment of VFF that shall be referred to as a VFF having "Boat Shape Cells"<br>
(BSC) 50. The "Boat Shaped Cell" embodiment 50 preferably has a mesh count of 40.<br>
"Boat Shape Cell" refers to the oval shape apertures 52 having rounded tips.<br>
Apertures 52 have a major axis 54 and a minor axis 56. Preferably, the ratio of length<br>
of major axis 54 to minor axis 56 of the cells is about 1.75:1. It has been found that<br>
rounding off the extremities of either an oval shaped cell, as shown in Figures 5A and<br>
5B, or an ellipse shaped cell, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, further enhances the STI,<br>
especially in a single plane material. The BSC embodiment 50 of Figures 5A and 5B<br>
has cells 50 having a<br>
length along the major axis 54 of about 425mm and a length along the minor axis of about<br>
240mm. The BSC film 50 has a loft of 315mrn and an open area of 22%, which yields a<br>
loft to % open area ratio of 14 and a rewet value of 0.15 grams. Of course, the above<br>
dimensions are illustrative and other dimensions of may be used.<br>
An additional feature of the BSC embodiment 50 is that the major axis 54 of the<br>
boat shaped cells or three dimensional apertures 52 are aligned in the SD but are not<br>
commonly aligned with each other, i.e., the cells 52 are presented in a "staggered"<br>
arrangement. Consequently, SD lands 58 are not straight as is the case with SD lands 34<br>
(Fig. 3) and 40 (Fig. 4) of VFF films 26 and 38, respectively. A film having bi-planar<br>
lands, e.g, the embodiment shown in Figure 1A and IB, are not preferred for the<br>
staggered BSC embodiment because it has been found that bi-planar lands are best<br>
achieved when all the SD lands, e.g. 34 and 40 are co-aligned with each other. Despite<br>
these less preferred variations, it has been found that panelists have still been able to<br>
derive a noticeable ST1 from the 40 mesh BSC (when counting the mesh in the TD)"<br>
embodiment 50. Application of a random matte texture to the lands further enhances the<br>
material and slightly improves a panel"s STI rating of the material.<br>
While it is known that the addition of any of the aforementioned VFF-capable<br>
textures to the lands will contribute to improvement of the tactile impression and eliminate<br>
any perceptive triggers that are indicative of a plastic type material, it has surprisingly been<br>
found that "micro-ridges" (MR) alone can create a perceptible STI. Referring to Figures<br>
6 A, 6B and 7, microphotographs of a top view of VFF 100 (the side to the user; Fig. 6 A)<br>
and a bottom view of VF 100 (the side away from the user; Fig. 6B), and an expanded<br>
graphic in cross-section of VFF 100 (Fig. 7) are given to show the MR of this invention.<br>
VFF 100 has a 40 hex pattern. To form textures on lands 102 of VFF 100, lands on a<br>
forming screen that is used to make VFF 100 are ground to be substantially flat to accept<br>
the artwork for etching the micro-ridges in the land region of the forming screen. As a<br>
result, lands 102, formed between apertures 104, are imparted with micro-ridges 106.<br>
The machine direction (MD) or stroking direction (SD) is indicated by arrow 108.<br>
Micro-ridges 106 preferably have individual distinction with a range of height and<br>
spacing and have an optimum STI effect when aligned on a bias, i.e., at offset angle 110<br>
to the SD 108. Offset angle 110 may be 5° to 80° to achieve some effect, but the<br>
preferred range for offset angle 110 is from 30° to 60°, and ideally 45° is used. The<br>
height of the MR 106 can range from 5mm to 75mm, but the preferred range is from 5mm<br>
to 35mm. Ideally, MR 106 have a height of 20mm. Spacing between micro-ridges 106<br>
can range from 25mm to 250mm, but more preferably range from 50mm to 150mm. Most<br>
preferably, a 95mm spacing is used. The micro-ridges 106 must also maintain<br>
"individuality". If micro-ridges 106 become interconnected, then micro-ridges 106 will<br>
not create the desired STI but rather the micro-ridges 106 will exhibit a planar and plastic-<br>
like feel instead.<br>
TEST DATA<br>
Various formed films were tested by ten panelists for silky tactile impression<br>
(STI). The results are presented in Table 2, below. The panel method was based upon<br>
the AATCC (1997) Evaluation Procedure 5, Fabric Hand: Guidelines for the Subjective<br>
Evaluation of Fabric, a Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists<br>
and Colorists. Volume 72 (pp.3 52-3 54). Research Triangle Park. NC; and. ASTM (1968)<br>
Manual on Sensory Testing Methods. ASTM Special Technical Bulletin 434, 1968.<br>
The evaluation procedure utilized a common pad of standard thickness and<br>
material yielding a standard compressibility. Values for thickness and compressibility are<br>
not particularly important, so long as the values are consistent. The pad was cut into 3.81<br>
cm by 7.62 cm (1.5 inch by 3.0 inch) rectangles. The films were wrapped fully around and<br>
taped closed, much like wrapping a gift, leaving on one side a continuous, smooth area<br>
of material. The continuous, smooth side comprise the tested side. Panelists washed their<br>
hands so that the samples were not tainted; tainting potentially creating an anomalous<br>
variance between panelist one and panelist ten, as the samples are passed from one<br>
panelist to another.<br>
The samples were coded by an identifier, such as a number or letter, but no<br>
information was provided to avoid any pre-biasing of a panelist. The panelists were asked<br>
to rate the samples from 1 to 10 with 1 being the silkiest and 10 being not silky.<br>
All but one of the products in the test data of Table 2 below are apertured film<br>
embodiments, except for "Unicharm"s TS Threads on NW". The Unicharm product is not<br>
a formed film product, but it has been added to Table 2 because it is recognized as<br>
succeeding as a feminine napkin topsheet in Asia and is known to be viewed as triggering<br>
a favorable STL It is constructed by an unknown method wherein synthetic silk threads<br>
are bonded to a top plane (skin contact side) of a nonwoven web. Holes are punched<br>
through the material, apparently to increase the rate of fluid acquisition. Its fluid<br>
acquisition rate value is believed to be over 3.0 grams. The Unicharm product is included<br>
here to assist in obtaining a stronger reading on the panel test"s apparent line of separation<br>
between STI and non-STI materials. Also included for that purpose is Comfort Silk®.<br>
Comfort Silk® is a mechanically formed apertured film but is not a VFF. It too<br>
has been accepted as "Silky" in the marketplace. Therefore, the inclusion of Comfort<br>
Silk® aids in making STI and non-STI distinctions.<br>
In reviewing the data, it is commonly accepted that an average ranking of a film<br>
by ten panelists of a value of 
rankings given by panelists can also serve as an indication that an STI has been "triggered".<br>
Another important test for comparing various films is a "Rewet Test". For testing<br>
rewet a test fluid comprising two parts Pepto-Bismol and one part distilled water was<br>
used. The sample assembly consisted of a 12.7 cm by 12.7 cm (5 inch by 5 inch) piece of<br>
vacuum formed film or nonwoven topsheet placed with the user side up and the garment<br>
side down over 3 pties of absorbent medium. An amount of 2-ml test fluid was delivered<br>
through a pipette onto the center surface of the topsheet. The time, in seconds, taken for<br>
all of the liquid to penetrate through the topsheet was recorded with a stopwatch. This<br>
portion of the test indicates the fluid acquisition rate. After the initial insult, an additional<br>
15-ml of the test fluid was delivered to the center surface of the topsheet. An 3.63 kg (8<br>
lbs) rewet weight with a 10.16 cm by 10.16 cm (4 inch by 4 inch) footing was placed on<br>
the top of the topsheet for 3 minutes for the fluid to thoroughly spread out into the core<br>
pads. Then, two pre-weighted pickup papers were pressed against the topsheet with the<br>
3.63 kg (8 lbs) rewet weight for an additional 2 minutes. The amount of weight increase<br>
of the pickup papers was measured in grams as the rewet amount, which reflects the<br>
amount of fluid that successfully reversed flow and overcame the spatial separation of the<br>
topsheet material.. It has been found that data using this fluid for both acquisition rate and<br>
rewet values correlates well to comparative data generated from the same VFF materials<br>
tested by this method and by undisclosed methods used by major corporations who<br>
produce feminine napkin products.<br>
Table 3, below, compares existing products and shows that embodiments of this<br>
invention provide a desirable STI, and also maintain a L/OA Ratio that exhibits functional<br>
rewet: -<br>
It is thus believed that the operation and construction of the present invention will<br>
be apparent from the foregoing description. While the apparatus and compositions shown<br>
or described have been characterized as being preferred it will be obvious that various<br>

and transverse direction lands (36. 46) between the<br>
cells. The stroking direction lands may be raised with<br>
respect lo the transverse direction lands. Micro-ridges<br>
(106) may be formed on the lands. The various film<br>
aspects, above, each contribute to the silky tactile<br>
impression of the film. Some or all of the various<br>
aspects described above may be combined to achieve<br>
a further improved silky tactile impression.</td>
