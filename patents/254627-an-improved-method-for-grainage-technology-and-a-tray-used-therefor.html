FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved method for grainage and a tray<br>
used therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Grainage is as such known in the art, comprising the steps of<br>
transportation, preservation, emergence, egg laying, washing and egg<br>
drying.<br>
Transportation involves transferring of cocoons in bamboo baskets,<br>
cartons or gunny bags. This allows limited transportation of alive<br>
cocoons in the form of garlands. Preservation of alive cocoons is carried<br>
out in the form of garlands of length 100-150 cm, which are placed on<br>
the stretched wire in the preservation room. The garlands and two<br>
consecutive rows of wires are separated by a distance of 4-9 inch and 2-<br>
21/2 feet respectively.<br><br>
As a result of preservation, emergence takes place from the garland. The<br>
egg-laying is done in the bamboo monias, earthen cups/pots, plastic<br>
boxes as well as in the nylon bags. The eggs are collected mechanically,<br>
which are processed in Musling cloth. Finally, spreading of the washed<br>
eggs is done on ash or oven/bioting paper so as to obtain the final<br>
product.<br>
The above process is associated with the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	Deficiency of grainage which results in high cost of seed<br>
production.<br>
2.	More space requirement.<br>
3.	Consumption of more time.<br>
4.	Decentralization of process, which requires more manpower.<br>
5.	It is hazardous.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to propose an improved<br>
method for grainage technology and a tray used therefor, which causes<br>
convenience in the sorting of alive cocoons.<br><br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved<br>
method for grainage and a tray used therefor which facilitates more<br>
production per unit area because of more preservation at a time.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose an improved method<br>
for grainage which is simple and easy to conduct.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an improved<br>
method for grainage and a tray used therefore which is more hygienic<br>
than the prior art thereby avoids dis-insfection.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved method for<br>
grainage comprising steps of transportation, preservation and emergence<br>
wherein the cocoons are disposed in the small holes and big holes of a<br>
tray provided with cones, which are closed with perforated cups; egg<br>
laying, for which the perforated caps are replaced with the cones; dipping<br>
of the tray with the cones in both sides in NaOH solution for 20 seconds<br>
and ringing in water is carried out for 5 times for 2 minutes each in 5<br>
different pots separately; dis-infection of the eggs is carried out in 3% Hcl<br>
and KOH solution for 30 minutes taken in the ratio of 1:1.<br>
».<br><br><br>
Further according to this invention there is provided a tray assembly for<br>
improved grainage comprising of a base tray provided with a plurality of<br>
big and small holes for the placement of cocoons therein, the big holes<br>
are disposed with a plurality of cones, perforated caps and pathological<br>
caps.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent<br>
from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows: plan and front elevation of the tray of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows: sectional view of the tray.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO<br>
ACCOMPANYING DRAWING.<br>
This invention proposes improved grainage technology which is<br>
conducted in a tray of the present invention. The tray is disposed with a<br>
plurality of big and small holes (1 and 2) symmetrically. The invention is<br>
carried out in 6 stages namely, transportation, preservation, emergence,<br>
egg laying, egg washing and egg drying as it was in prior art;<br>
In the process of transportation, the big holes of the tray are fixed with<br>
the cones (3) and tasar cocoons are placed in the small holes.<br>
This step is followed by placement of second tier of cocoons inside the<br>
cone on its reverse side, which is closed with perforated cup. The trays<br><br><br>
are piled after filling each tray. The cones are provided with a plurality of<br>
slits on their circumference and perforations on their top portion.<br>
The cocoons in the tray are allowed for preservation and emergence for a<br>
prescribed time period with the cones and perforated caps. During<br>
preservation, each tray is put on the rack in the preservation room. The<br>
emergence is followed by egg laying for which the perforated cap is<br>
replaced with cone.<br>
Thereafter, the moth are taken to the Examination room for testing,<br>
which confirms the dis-infection of the moth. This test is carried out in<br>
an other tray, the big holes of which are fixed with the pathelogical cups<br>
provided with pastals. The pathelogical cups are used for moth smear<br>
preparation. The infected eggs are taken out of the tray. Subsequently,<br>
the tray with eggs and cones on both sides is dipped in NaOH solution<br>
for maximum 20 second and thoroughly ringed in water for atleast 5<br>
times for 2 minutes each in 5 different pots separately. Ultimately the<br>
eggs are dis-infected with 3% Hcl and 3% KOH solution for 30 minutes<br>
taken in the ratio of 1:1 and the dis-infected eggs are washed with water<br>
and allowed to dry in-situ condition.<br><br><br>
The eggs are prepared in the cellular condition which can be collected by<br>
taking out the lower cones for mass production and supply.<br>
The base tray is made of for example: plastic (HDP/LDP) or PVC. The<br>
collars are extended upwardly and downwardly so as to facilitate the<br>
placement of the different components like cones etc. The big holes are<br>
provided in for example: 6X7 rows. The small holes are extended in one<br>
direction having collar provided in for example: 6X5 rows.<br>
In the present invention, the upside down placement of cocoons against<br>
the traditions enables smooth emergence and conserves energy of moth<br>
resulting in better fecundity.<br>
This is in confirmation with other sericigenous insects such as Bombyx<br>
mori. The statistically pooled data on emergence efficiency, crippled<br>
moth, pupal mortality and egg laying co-efficient are presented in Table -<br>
1 given below:-	<br><br><br>
The perusal of data indicates that there is non-significant difference at<br>
5% level in emergence efficiency of both the sexes, mean emergence of<br>
male and female crippled moth and egg laying coefficient under existing<br>
practices. However, moth and pupal mortality showed statistically<br>
significant difference at 5% level. It adjudicated that the application of<br>
TGT is at par with the existing grainage practices. It indicated<br>
statistically significant reduced pupal mortality (7.77 ± 2.37) and moth<br>
mortality (0.92 ± 0.21) in non-diapausing population against control i.e<br>
26.63 ± 2.33 and 2.28 ± 0.54 respectively. The perusal of Table 3<br>
indicates that a total of 38660 cocoons processed and produced 7965<br>
dfls with 4.85:1 (cocoon dfl) is at par with expected result of 5:1. The<br>
second crop grainage gave 3.86:1 in DTv and 4.9:1 in DBv indicates<br>
better results which can be further improvised with TGT applications.<br>
The economics of TGT projections against the existing practices to<br>
adjudicate the unit cost of tasar seed production is depicted in Table 2. It<br>
is note that with TGT applications, the unit cost of BV and TV dfls comes<br>
to Rs. 3.51 and Rs. 2.86 respectively against Rs. 4.35 and Rs. 3.50, with<br>
existing technology. With introduction of total modality in grainage has<br>
an economic efficiency of 19.3% and 18.29%. This also<br><br>
reduces drastically the capital expenditure on infrastructures with<br>
partial reduction in working capital.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to<br>
modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such<br>
variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this<br>
invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention,<br>
which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br>
