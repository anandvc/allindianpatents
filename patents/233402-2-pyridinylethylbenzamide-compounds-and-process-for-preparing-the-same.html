				<td>New 2-pyridinylethylbenzamide compounds<br>
The present invention relates to novel N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]benzamide derivatives, their process of preparation, their use as fungicides, particularly in the form of fungicidal compositions, and methods for the control of phytopathogenic fungi of plants using these compounds or their compositions.<br>
The international patent application WO 01/11965 discloses a broad family of fungicidal compounds in which the 2-pyridyl group is substituted by at least one halogenoalkyl group.<br>
It is always of high-interest in agriculture to use novel pesticidal compounds in order to avoid or to fight the development of resistant strains to the active ingredients used by the farmer. It is also of high-interest to use novel compounds being more active than those already known, with the aim of decreasing the amounts of active material to be used by the farmer, whilst at the same time maintaining an effectiveness at least equivalent to the already known compounds.<br>
We have now found a new family of compounds which possess the above mentioned characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]benzamide derivative of general formula (I):<br>

It will nevertheless be understood that, on the basis of his general knowledge and of available publications, the skilled worker will be able to adapt this method according to the specifics of each of the compounds, whidi it is desired to synthesise.<br>
The present invention also relates to a fungicidal composition comprising an effective amount of an active material of general formula (I). Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a fungicidal composition comprising, as an active ingredient, an effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) as defined above and an agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or filler.<br>
In the present specification, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic material with which the active material is combined to make it easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid. Examples of suitable supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water, alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents, mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports may also be used.<br>
The composition may also comprise additional components. In particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surfactants. Mention may be made, for example, of polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates),<br>
phosphoric esters of polyoxyethylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the above compounds containing sulphate, sulphonate and phosphate functions. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when the active material and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content may be comprised between 5% and 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Optionally, additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents. More generally, the active materials can be combined with any solid or liquid additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.<br>
In general, the composition according to the invention may contain from 0.05 to 99% (by weight) of active material, preferably 10 to 70% by weight.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention can be used in various forms such as aerosol dispenser, capsule suspension, cold fogging concentrate, dustable powder, emulsifiable concentrate, emulsion oil in water, emulsion water in oil, encapsulated granule, fine granule, flowable concentrate for seed treatment, gas (under pressure),gas generating product, granule, hot fogging concentrate, macrogranule, microgranule, oil dispersible powder, oil miscible flowable concentrate, oil miscible liquid, paste, plant rodlet, powder for dry seed treatment, seed coated with a pesticide, soluble concentrate, soluble powder, solution for seed treatment, suspension concentrate (flowable concentrate), ultra low volume (ulv) liquid, ultra low volume (ulv) suspension, water dispersible granules or tablets, water dispersible powder for slurry treatment, water soluble granules or tablets, water soluble powder for seed treatment and wettable powder.<br>
These compositions include not only compositions which are ready to be applied to the plant or seed to be treated by means of a suitable device, such as a spraying or dusting device, but also concentrated commercial compositions which must be diluted before application to the crop.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be mixed with one or more insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, attractant acaricides or pheromones or other compounds with biological activity. The mixtures thus obtained have a broadened spectrum of activity. The mixtures with other fungicides are particularly advantageous.<br>
The fungicidal compositions of the present invention can be used to curatively or preventively control the phytopathogenic fungi of crops. Thus, according to a further<br>
aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for curatively or preventively controlling the phytopathogenic fungi of crops characterised in that a fiingicidal composition as hereinbefore defined is applied to the seed, the plant and/or to the fruit of the plant or to the soil in which the plant is growing or in which it is desired to grow.<br>
The composition as used against phytopathogenic fungi of crops comprises an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of an active material of general formula (I).<br>
The expression "effective and non-phytotoxic amount" means an amount of composition according to the invention which is sufficient to control or destroy the fungi present or liable to appear on the crops, and which does not entail any appreciable symptom of phytotoxicity for the said crops. Such an amount can vary within a wide range depending on the fungus to be controlled, the type of crop, the climatic conditions and the compounds included in the fungicidal composition according to the invention.<br>
This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the capabilities of a person-skilled in the art.<br>
The method of treatment according to the present invention is useful to treat propagation material such as tubers or rhizomes, but also seeds, seedlings or seedlings pricking out and plants or plants pricking out. This method of treatment can also be useful to treat roots. The method of treatment according to the present invention can also be useful to treat the overground parts of the plant such as trunks, steins or stalks, leaves, flowers and fruits of the concerned plant.<br>
