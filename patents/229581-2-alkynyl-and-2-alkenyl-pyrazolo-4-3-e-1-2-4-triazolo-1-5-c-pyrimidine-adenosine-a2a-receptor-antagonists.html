				<td>2-ALKYNYL- AND 2-ALKENYL-PYRAZOL044,3reVI ,2,4-TRlAZOLO-11.5-s1-PYRIMIDINE ADENOSINE A20 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to 2-alkynyl- and 2-alkenyl-pyrazoIo-[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazo!o[1,5-c]pyrimidine adenosine A2a receptor antagonists, the use of said compounds in the treatment of central nervous system diseases, in particular Parkinson's disease, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds.<br>
Adenosine is known to be an endogenous modulator of a number of physiological functions. At the cardiovascular system level, adenosine is a strong vasodilator and a cardiac depressor. On the central nervous system, adenosine induces sedative, anxiolytic and antiepileptic effects. On the respiratory system, adenosine induces bronchoconstriction. At the kidney level, it exerts a biphasic action, inducing vasoconstriction at low concentrations and vasodilation at high doses. Adenosine acts as a lipolysis inhibitor on fat cells and as an antiaggregant on platelets.<br>
Adenosine action is mediated by the interaction with different membrane specific receptors which belong to the family of receptors coupled with G proteins. Biochemical and pharmacological studies, together with advances in molecular biology, have allowed the identification of at least four subtypes of adenosine receptors: Ai, A2a, A2b and A3. Ai and A3 are high-affinity, inhibiting theactivity of the enzyme adenylate cyclase, and A2a and A2b are low-affinity, stimulating the activity of the same enzyme. Analogs of adenosine able to interact as antagonists with the Ai, A2a, A2b and A3 receptors have also been identified.<br>
Selective antagonists for the A2a receptor are of pharmacological interest because of their reduced level of side effects. In the central nervous system, A2a antagonists can have antidepressant properties and stimulate cognitive functions.<br><br>
Moreover, data has shown that A2a receptors are present in high density in the basal ganglia, known to be important in the control of movement. Hence, A2a antagonists can improve motor impairment due to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, senile dementia as in Alzheimer's disease, and psychoses of organic origin.<br>
Some xanlhine-related compounds have been found to be Ai receptor selective antagonists, and xanthine and non-xanthine compounds have been found to have high A2a affinity with varying degrees of A2a vs. Ai selectivity. Triazolo-pyrimidine adenosine A2a receptor antagonists have been disclosed previously, for example in WO 95/01356; US 5,565,460; WO 97/05138; WO 98/52568, WO 01/92264, and PCT/US02/32630, filed October 11, 2002.<br>
Adenosine A2a receptor antagonists have been disclosed as being useful in the treatment or prevention of Extra Pyramidal Syndrome, dystonia, restless leg syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) in PCT/US03/40456, filed December 17, 2003, and have been disclosed as being useful in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in WO 02/055083.<br><br><br><br><br>
R10 is H, alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, OH or hydroxyalkyl; R17 is H or alkyl; and R18 is H or alkyl.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of formula I in a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of treating central nervous system diseases such as depression, cognitive diseases and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, senile dementia or psychoses of organic origin, and stroke, comprising administering at least one compound of formula I to a mammal in need of such treatment.<br>
The invention also relates to the treatment of attention related disorders such as attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The invention also relates to the treatment or prevention of Extra-Pyramidal Syndrome (e.g., dystonia, akathisia, pseudoparkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia), the treatment of primary (idiopathic) dystonia, and the treatment or prevention of dystonia in patients who exhibit dystonia as a result of treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant, lithium or an anticonvulsant, or who have used cocaine, comprising administering at least one compound of formula I to a mammal in need of such treatment. The invention further relates to treatment of abnormal movement disorders such as restless leg syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS), comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of formula I.<br>
In particular, the invention is drawn to the method of treating Parkinson's disease comprising administering at least one compound of formula I to a mammal in need of such treatment.<br>
Still another aspect of the invention is a method of treating Parkinson's disease with a combination of at least one compound of formula I and one or more agents useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, for example dopamine; a dopaminergic agonist; an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, type B (MAO-B); a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI); or a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. Also claimed is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of<br><br>
formula I and one or more agents known to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The invention also comprises a method of treating RLS or PLMS comprising aciministering a combination of at least one compound of formula I with another agent useful in treating RLS or PLMS, such as levodopa/carbidopa, levodopa/benserazide, a dopamine agonist, a benzodiazepine, an opioid, an anticonvulsant or iron, to a patient in need thereof.<br>

The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms "salt", "solvate" "prodrug" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be prepared by known methods from starting materials either known in the art or prepared by methods known in the art; see, for example, WO 95/01356, J. Med. Chem., 39 (1996) 1164-1171, and WO 01/92264.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be prepared by several methods. A<br><br>
Aldehyde 2 is reacted with hydrazine to furnish 3, preferably in DMF at room temperature. Reaction of 3 with an alkylating reagent, such as bromide 4, yields chloride 5. This conversion is carried out in the presence of a base such as NaH, in a solvent such as DMF at room temperature. Reaction of 5 with 6, a protected form of hydrazine, furnishes 7. The reaction is best carried out in DMF at elevated temperature of 80-100°C. The protective group Q is preferably f-butoxycarbonyl (Boc). Compound 7 is converted to 9 by reaction with a piperazine 8. The reaction is preferably carried out in DMF at elevated temper3tures of 80-100°C with catalytic Kl. When the protective group Q in 9 is Boc, treatment with HCI/dioxane furnishes hydrazine 10. Acylation of 10 with a carboxylic acid is effected, for example, with the acid and a carbodiimide, or with a preformed mixed anhydride, such as that with isopropyl chloroformate. Hydrazide 11 is cyclized to I. This cyclization can be accomplished with N,0-bis(trimethylsiIyI)acetamidfe in DMF at 120°C or other known cyclization methods can be used.<br>
In certain cases, the initial R group may contain a protective group, such as trimethylsilyl for an acetylene or t-butyldimethylsilyl for an alcohol. The protective group may be removed following the conversion to formula I by employing well known<br><br>
Compound 7 is deprotected as for 9, and 12 is acylated as for 10. Hydrazide 13 is cyclized as for 11. Amination of 14 to yield I takes place at temperatures of 100-160°C, preferably in DMF and in the presence of Kl. Heating may also be effected by microwave irradiation in a sealed vessel yielding temperatures of 190-210°C<br>
Another method is illustrated in Scheme 3.<br><br><br>
A hydroxyalkylpyrazole 15, prepared by methods well-known in the art, is aminated with 8. The amination involves activation of the alcohol with a reagent such as methanesulfonyl chloride or thionyl chloride and a base, typically an amine. Reaction of the activated alcohol with 8 provides piperazine 16. Reaction of 16 with a trialkyl orthoformate in the presence of an acid such as methanesulfonic acid provides 17. Heating 17 with hydrazide 18 in a solvent such as anisole in the presence of an acid such as isobutyric acid furnishes tricyclic 19. Treatment of 19 with aqueous acid, typically hydrochloric acid, provides amine 20. Cyclization of 20 with cyanogen bromide, preferably in the presence of a catalyst such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine and a solvent such as aqueous acetonitrile, yields. I.<br>

Haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the rat<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Calco, Italy) weighing 175-200 g are used. The cataleptic state is induced by the subcutaneous administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol (1 mg/kg, sc), 90 min before testing the animals on the vertical grid test. For this test, the rats are placed on the wire mesh cover of a 25x43 plexiglass cage placed at an angle of about 70 degrees with the bench table. The rat is placed on the grid with all four legs abducted and extended ("frog posture"). The use of such an unnatural posture is essential for the specificity of this test for catalepsy. The time span from placement of the paws until the first complete removal of one paw (descent latency) is measured maximally for 120 sec.<br>
The selective A2A adenosine antagonists under evaluation are administered orally at doses ranging between 0.03 and 3 mg/kg, 1 and 4 h before scoring the animals.<br>
In separate experiments, the anticataleptic effects of the reference compound, L-DOPA (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, ip), were determined.<br>
6-OHPA Lesion of the Middle Forebrain Bundle in Rats<br>
Adult male Sprague-Dowley rats (Charles River, Calco, Como, Italy), weighing 275-300 g, are used in all experiments. The rats are housed in groups of 4 per cage,<br><br>
with free access to food and water, under controlled temperature and 12 hour light/ dark cycle. The day before the surgery the rats are fasted over night with water ad libitum.<br>
Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of the middle forebrain bundle is performed according to the method described by Ungerstedt et al. (Brain Research, 1971, 6-OHDA and Cathecolarnine Neurons, North Holland, Amsterdam, 101-127), with minor changes. Briefly, the animals are anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, ip) and treated with desipramine (10 mpk, ip) 30 min'prior to 6-OHDA injection in order to block the uptake of the toxin by the noradrenergic terminals. Then, the animals are placed in a stereotaxic frame. The skin over the skull is reflected and the stereotaxic coordinates (-2.2 posterior from bregma (AP), +1.5 lateral from bregma (ML), 7.8 ventral from dura (DV) are taken, according io the atlas of Pellegrino et al (Pellegrino L.J., Pellegrino A.S. and Cushman A J., A Stereotaxic Atlas of the Rat Brain, 1979, New York: Plenum Press). A burr hole is then placed in the skull over the lesion site and a needle, attached to a Hamilton syringe, is lowered into the left MFB. Then 8 fig 6-OHDA-HCI is dissolved in 4 μl of saline with 0.05% ascorbic acid as antioxidant, and infused at the constant flow rate of 1 μl /1 min using an infusion pump. The needle is withdrawn after additional 5 min and the surgical wound is closed and the animals left to recover for 2 weeks.<br>
Two weeks after the lesion the rats are administered with L-DOPA (50 mg/kg, ip) plus Benserazide (25 mg/kg, ip) and selected on the basis of the number of full contralateral turns quantified in the 2 h testing period by automated rotameters (priming tesf). Any rat not showing at least 200 complete turns /2h is not included in the study.<br>
Selected rats receive the test drug 3 days after the priming test (maximal dopamine receptor supersensitivity). The new A2A receptor antagonists are administered orally at dose levels ranging between 0.1 and 3 mg/kg at different time points (i.e., 1, 6,12 h) before the injection of a subthreshold dose of L-DOPA (4 mpk, ip) plus benserazide (4 mpk, ip) and the evaluation of turning behavior.<br>
Using the above test procedures, the following results were obtained for preferred and/or representative compounds of the invention.<br>
Results of the binding assay on compounds of the invention showed A2a Ki values of 0.3 to 57 nM, with preferred compounds showing Ki values between 0.3 and<br><br>
5.0 nM. Compound 1-17 had a Ki of 2.2 nM; compound 5-4 had a Ki of 2.3 nM; compound 5-117 had a Ki of 0.5 nM; and compound 5-124 had a Ki of 0.6 nM.<br>
Selectivity is determined by dividing Ki for A1 receptor by Ki for A2a receptor. Preferred compounds of the invention have a selectivity ranging from about 100 to about 2000.<br>
Preferred compounds showed a 50-75% decrease in descent latency when tested orally at 1 mg/kg for anti-cataleptic activity in rats.<br>
In the 6-OHDA lesion test, rats dosed orally with 1 mg/kg of the preferred compounds performed 170-440 turns in the two-hour assay period.<br>
In the haloperidol-induced catalepsy test, a combination of sub-threshold amount of a compound of formula I and a sub-threshold amount of L-DOPA showed a significant inhibition of the catalepsy, indicating a synergistic effect. In the 6-OHDA lesion test, test animals administered a combination of a compound of formula I and a sub-threshold amount of L-DOPA demonstrated significantly higher contralateral turning.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 70 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection.<br>
Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.<br><br>
Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably the compound is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br>
The quantity of active compound of formula I in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg to 300 mg, according to the particular application.<br>
The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.<br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen for compounds of formula i is oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses to provide relief from central nervous system diseases such as Parkinson's disease or the other disease or conditions listed above.<br>
The doses and dosage regimen of the dopaminergic agents will be determined by the attending clinician in view of the approved doses and dosage regimen in the<br><br>
package insert, taking into consideration the age, sex and condition of the patient and the severity of the disease. It is expected that when the combination of a compound of formula I and a dopaminergic agent is administered, lower doses of the components will be effective compared to the doses of the components administered as monotherapy.<br>
