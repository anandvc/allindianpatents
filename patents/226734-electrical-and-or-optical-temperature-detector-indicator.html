				<td>ELECTRICAL AND/OR OPTICAL TEMPERATURE<br>
DETECTOR/INDICATOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an electrical and/or optical temperature<br>
detector / indicator on the basis of conductive polymers, said detector / indicator<br>
being suitably used in packages for products, the temperature changes of which<br>
need to be monitored.<br>
Prior Art<br>
At present, various temperature-sensitive indicators based on colour change,<br>
used for montoring the storage of highly perishable products such as food<br>
products, drugs, biological materials, chemicals, coating compositions,<br>
adhesives, cosmetics, food additives, materials for photography, and vaccines,<br>
are known. The life span of food products is often rather short, and the shelf life<br>
thereof is clearly dependent on the uninterrupted cold storage chain. Especially<br>
meat and milk products keep best at low temperatures where the proliferation of<br>
harmful bacteria is slower. However, if the temperature of the product is allowed<br>
to increase even momentarily, the bacterial growth will accelerate, and<br>
notwithstanding the recooling of the food product, the shelf life thereof will be<br>
considerably shortened. The process of shipping of products such as food<br>
produts from production plants to retail stores, and finally to the customers<br>
includes several steps wherein the cold chain may be interrupted. It is important<br>
for consumers, retail trade wholesalers, and producers of food products to<br>
readiv notice the interruption of the cold chain with for instance electrical or<br>
optical means.<br>
The temperature detectors used at present mainly indicate the maximum, or<br>
minimum storage temperature of the product, and they are normally attached as<br><br>
self-adhesive labels on the food product packages. Said temperature detectors<br>
must be activated by suitable procedures before use. WO 9931501 discloses a<br>
method and means for activating an indicator comprising a pair of ampoules filled<br>
with liquids, said ampoules being separated by an element that may be broken<br>
readily. A compressive force is applied to the breakable element, thus breaking it,<br>
whereupon the liquids are mixed and activation is completed.<br>
Ba:;ed on what is said above, there is an evident need for such a temperature<br>
detector / indicator that may directly be incorporated into the particular packing<br>
material of the product, thus avoiding the steps of attachment and activation of<br>
self-adhesive labels. Particularly in food industry, there is a need for improved<br>
control of the cold storage chain, and for a low-cost temperature detector /<br>
ind cator for monitoring and controlling said cold chain.<br>
General Description of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an electrical and/or optical temperature<br>
detector / indicator allowing the monitoring of the temperature of a product, and<br>
electrical and/or optical detection of the exceeded temperature limit.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrical and/or optical<br>
temperature detector / indicator based on a conductive polymer and/or<br>
polyelectrolyte.<br>
Still Luiother object of the present invention is a method for producing an electrical<br>
and/or optical temperature detector / indicator.<br>
Further, an object of the present invention is the use of an electrical and/or optical<br>
temperature detector / indicator for monitoring temperatures of product packages<br>
and tor detectmg exceeded temperature limits.<br><br>
The electrical and/or optical temperature detector / indicator according to the<br>
invention comprises a conductive polymer layer incorporated into, or onto a<br>
substrate material, and at least one dedoping or doping layer. Said layers are<br>
preferably separated from each other by a thin protective layer preventing the<br>
dedoping or doping agent from diffusing into the conductive polymer layer at<br>
correct storage temperatures.<br>
Characteristic features of the electrical and/or optical temperature detector /<br>
indicator according to the invention, the method for the production thereof, and<br>
the use thereof are presented in the claims.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that the problems associated with solutions according to<br>
prior art inay be avoided, or substantially reduced by the electrical and/or optical<br>
temperatare detector / indicator according to the invention. On one hand, said<br>
temperature detector / indicator is based on the redox reaction of said conductive<br>
polymers, and on the other hand, on transition temperatures of organic or<br>
inorganic polymeric or low molecular weight dedoping or doping compounds<br>
and/or protective layer materials. A doping compound means here a compound<br>
having a pH value not higher than 6, and/or a compound that increases the<br>
conductivity of a non-doped conductive polymer more than a 10-fold, whereas a<br>
dedoping compound means a compound having a pH value not less than 8, and/or<br>
a compound that decreases the conductivity of a doped conductive polymer more<br>
than 10-fold.<br>
In a preferable embodiment a temperature-sensitive protective layer material is<br>
used, whtreby the protective layer melts by a temperature increase, thus allowing<br>
the doping/dsdoping compound to be partly or totally dissolved in said protective<br>
layer material, and/or the doping/dedoping compound may otherwise react with<br>
the conductive polymer.<br><br>
Temperature detection / indication takes place electrically by monitoring electrical<br>
conductivity changes of the conductive polymer and/or optically by means of<br>
following a colour change. One of these phenomena is, or both are, an irreversible<br>
change in the detector / indicator structure.<br>
The mobility of solid state dedoping compounds is substantially lower than that of<br>
liquid or gaseous dedoping compounds, and accordingly, also dedoping of the<br>
conductive polymers is essentially slower. Transition temperatures of chemical<br>
dedoping compounds include melting temperature and glass transition<br>
temperature, above which chemical reactions with conductive polymers are<br>
accelerated, and electrical conductivity is rapidly lowered. The doping compound<br>
and the protective layer material may have identical transition states with the<br>
dedoping compound, that is melting and glass transition.<br>
The electrical temperature detector / indicator according to the invention<br>
comprises a conductive polymer layer incorporated mto, or onto a substrate<br>
material, said conductive polymer layer comprising a conductive polymer in<br>
conductive form and at least one dedoping layer, or a conductive polymer in non-<br>
conducting form and at least one doping layer. The thickness of the conductive<br>
polymer layer is from 0 to 2 mm, preferably from 0.001 to 1 mm, and particularly<br>
preferably from 0.001 to 0.1 mm.<br>
Said layers are separated from each other by one or more thin protective layer. In<br>
some cases it is preferable to substitute a doping compound for the dedoping<br>
compound, and accordingly, a-non-conducting form of the conductive polymer is<br>
used. The conductive polymer layer and dedoping/doping layer may be<br>
superimposed, or they may lie as parallel stripes, dots or geometric patterns,<br>
separated by a protective layer. The thickness of the protective layer is from 0 to 2<br>
nun, preferably from 0.001 to 1.0 mm, and particularly preferably from 0.001 to<br>
0.1 mm.<br><br>
In the present invention, doping and dedoping of a conductive polymer is<br>
combined to a change caused by transition temperatures of organic/inorganic<br>
compounds for controlling the cold chain of temperature sensitive products. In the<br>
electrical and/or optical temperature detector / indicator according to the<br>
invention, the conductive polymer and the dedoping/doping compound are in<br>
sepiirate layers.<br>
Suitable dedoping compounds are basic compounds having a pH of ≥ 8, and/or<br>
agents decreasing the conductivity of a doped conductive polymer by a factor of<br>
at least 10 (Σ = 10, Σ = Σintial / Σfmal), preferably Σ = 103, and more preferably<br>
Σ = more than 105. Suitable bases include organic and inorganic bases such as<br>
aromatic and aliphatic amines, pyridine, urea derivatives, alkalimetal, alkaline<br>
earth metal, and metal hydroxides and carbonates, preferably octadecyl amine,<br>
hexadecyl amine, hexamethyl tetraamine, and derivatives thereof<br>
Suitable doping compounds are substances having a pH of ≤ 6, and/or agents that<br>
increase the conductivity of a non-doped conductive polymer by a factor of at<br>
least. 10 (Σ = 10, Σ = Σintial / Σfmal),, preferably ACT = 103, and more preferably<br>
Σ = more than 105. Examples of doping agents include organic and inorganic<br>
acidis such as sulphonic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, nitric<br>
acid. nitrous acid, HC1, HI, HF, HBr, HC104, HClO3, H2CO3, and some carboxylic<br>
acids such as acetic acid, formic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid,<br>
tartaric acid, citric acid, famaric acid, malic acid, and derivatives thereof Two or<br>
more of said dedoping/doping layers may also be present. Processability and<br>
stability of the dedoping and doping compounds may be improved by adding a<br>
suitable polymer, i.e. a support not altering transition temperatures, dedoping or<br>
doping rates or not otherwise influencing the operation of the detector. Suitable<br>
supporting polymers include polymeric materials such as polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, polystyrene, polymethyhnetacrylate, polyvinylphenol, polystyrene-<br>
polybutadiene latexes, and polystyrene-polyethylene-butylene block copolymers.<br><br>
The conductive polymer and the dedoping/doping compound are preferably<br>
separated from each other by a thin protective layer. Said protective layer<br>
comprises a material not significantly influencing the conductivity of the doped or<br>
undoped conductive polymer. Examples of suitable protective layer materials<br>
include alkyl alcohols and phenols, 1-dodecylalcohol, 1-tetradecylalcohol and 1-<br>
decylalcohol being preferable. Said protective layer may comprise a single<br>
material, or a mixture of several materials, thus allowing the adjustment of the<br>
transition temperature. The protective layer materials may be further selected from<br>
materials not reacting with the dedoping or doping compound, and/or the reaction<br>
may not influence the operation of the detector/indicator. The stability and<br>
sensitivity of the detector/indicator may be improved with the temperature-<br>
sensitive protective layer, thus avoiding "crawling effect", that is, slow alteration<br>
of resistance during storage at low temperatures.<br>
Above the transition temperature and at a precisely defined temperature, the<br>
deJoping/doping agent may penetrate the protective layer to reach the conductive<br>
polymer layer, and accordingly, cause a change in the electrical conductivity. The<br>
change in the electrical conductivity may for instance be measured with galvanic<br>
circuitry as a resistance measurement, and/or as a change in capacitance, and/or in<br>
a wireless manner. Suitable temperature range for the operation of the<br>
detector/indicator of the invention is between -50 °C and +200 °C.<br>
U.seful conductive polymers include for instance polyelectrolytes, polythiophenes,<br>
pc lypyrroles, polyaniline, and the derivatives thereof). A preferable conductive<br>
polymer is polyaniline (PANI), which theoretically contains in the polymer chain<br>
equal amounts of imines and amines in emeraldine base form, one of the forms<br>
being, however, actually often present in excess. The general structure of PANI is<br>
presented by the formula I below.<br><br><br>
The emeraldine base is structurally not conjugated, and thus it is not electrically<br>
conducting, the conductivity thereof being about 10-12 S/cm. When a conductive<br>
polymer is contacted with a strong acid, a proton is transferred fronn the acid to<br>
the polymer whereupon the polymer forms a conjugated structure allowing the<br>
electrons to migrate along the polymer chain, thus providing a conductivity of<br>
even more than 102 S/cm. Protonation may thus alter the conductivity by a factor<br>
of about 1014. Alterations of the conductivity of the conductive polymer may be<br>
utlized in the temperature detectors / indicators according to the invention.<br>
Irrines present in the polymer chain are weak bases in comparison to low<br>
molecular basic compounds, and for this reason, a strong acid reacts more<br>
readily with such molecules rather than with polymers. When a conductive<br>
polyaniline is; added with amines or similar basic compounds having low<br>
molecular weight, a strong acid is cleaved from the polyaniline, thus lowering the<br>
conductivity cf the polymer.<br>
The invention is now illustrated by means of the appended Figures without<br>
wishing to limit the scope thereof.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows two alternative principal structures of the electrical temperature<br>
detector / indicator of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the change of the resistance for the structure of Figure 1.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows the change of the resistance for another electrical temperature<br>
detector / indicator according to the invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows the change of the resistance, when a protective layer having a<br>
higher melting point was used.<br>
Figure 5 shows the change of the resistance, when protective layer materials<br>
having different melting points were mixed with each other.<br>
In Figure 6, the effect of mixing on the melting point was studied by DSC<br>
method.<br>
Figure 7 shows melting points vs. parts by weight of a protective layer material<br>
melting at 7 °C.<br>
Figure 8 shows the increase of the relative resistance of an indicator for a deep-<br>
frozen product vs. time at -6 °C, and in case the product/deep-frozen product is<br>
thawed for a moment.<br>
In Figure 1, layer A represents a conductive polymer layer, layer B means a<br>
protective layer, and layer C means a dedoping/doping layer before reaching the<br>
transition temperature. D represents the substrate having the temperature<br>
detector/indicator incorporated therein/thereon. In Figure la, the layers are<br>
superimposed, and in Figure lb, the conductive polymer layer A and the<br>
dec.oping/doping layer C are in the form of parallel stripes separated by the<br>
protective layer B.<br>
Figure 2 shows the change of resistance vs. time (1 - 1000 min) at different<br>
temperatures for a electrical temperature detector / indicator structure of Figure 1.<br>
Octadecyl amine is used as the dedoping agent, and polymethylmetacrylate is<br><br>
used as the protective layer. Such a structure is very suitable for example for<br>
monitoring the heating of food products for microwave ovens.<br>
Figure 3 shows resistance measurements for a temperature-sensitive protective<br>
layer (1-dodecyl alcohol). Changes in the conductivity take place near the storage<br>
temperature of the product. Melting point of the protective layer was 22 °C. The<br>
resistance hardly "crawls" with time although the temperature is just below the<br>
melting temperature of the protective layer.<br>
Figure 4 shows the change of resistance, when a protective layer having a higher<br>
melting point (1-tetradecyl alcohol) was used. In this test series, a protective layer<br>
melting at Tm, = 38 °C was tested, and the Figure shows the change of resistances<br>
of these samples at different temperatures vs. time.<br>
Figure 5 shows the change of the resistances when protective layer materials<br>
having different melting points were mixed with each other, the effect of said<br>
mixing on the melting temperature was studied indirectly with conductivity<br>
measurements. The change of the resistance is presented at different temperatures<br>
vs. time, when two protective layer materials (1-tetradecyl alcohol and 1-dodecyI<br>
alcohol) were mixed with each other, the mixing ratio being (38 °C : 22 °C = SO :<br>
20). From Figures 3 - 5, it may be seen that the melting temperature may be<br>
adjusted by mixing protective layer materials.<br>
In Figure 6, the effect of mixing on the melting temperature was studied by DSC<br>
(differential scamiing calorimetry). The melting temperatures of the protective<br>
layer materials to be mixed were, 7 °C, and 22 "C, respectively. The Figure shows<br>
DSC graphs obtained with different mixing ratios (1-decyl allcohol and 1-dodecyl<br>
alcohol).<br>
Figun; 7 shows melting temperatures vs. parts by weight of a protective layer<br>
material meltmg at 7 "C. As may be seen from the Figure, the melting temperature<br><br>
may be adjusted by altering the mixing ratio of the materials. It may thus be<br>
concluded that the sensitivity of the indicator may be significantly improved by a<br>
temperature-sensitive protective layer. On the other hand it was shown that the<br>
indication temperature may be adjusted.<br>
Figure 8 shows the increase of the relative resistance of an indicator for a deep-<br>
frozen product vs. time at -6 °C, and in case the product/deep-frozen product is<br>
thawed for a moment. This indicator indicates changes of the storage temperature<br>
around 0 °C, the indication precision being a few degrees. The Figure shows the<br>
results for an indicator comprising, in addition to conductive polymer, protective<br>
and chemical dedoping layers, a temperature sensitive protective layer for<br>
improving the sensitivity of the indicator. The Figure shows the relative resistance<br>
vs. time for a protective layer structure. A sample constantly at -6 °C will not age<br>
significantly, whereas the resistance starts to increase if the sample is warmed to<br>
+2 °C. With said structure, also the quality of the product/deep-frozen product<br>
may be measured since the increase of the resistance is significantly slower with<br>
the temperature being relowered to -6 °C.<br>
The electrical and/or optical temperature detector / indicator of the invention may<br>
be manufactured on a substrate selected from the group consisting of paper,<br>
cardboard, paperboard, plastic materials for food products, or metals, paper,<br>
cardboard, and paperboard being preferable. It may be produced by printing or<br>
coating processes, for instance using processing teclinologies suitable for<br>
packaging machines, such as gravure printing, spray coating, inkjet, blade coating,<br>
offset, flexo, spincoating, silk screen printing, or lamination processes. The entire<br>
surface of the packaging material may also be coated by said electrical and/or<br>
optical temperature detector / indicator, and if necessary, self-adhesive labels may<br>
be manufactured therefrom for attaching on the package. Each layer may also be<br>
printed on its respective substrate followed by adhesion thereof with each other<br>
e.g. for producing self-adhesive labels. An adhesive layer may optionally be<br>
printed between the layers. Also, the conductive polymer layer and the<br><br>
dedoping/doping layers may be printed on their respective foils that will<br>
subsequently be adhered to each other.<br>
Said electrical and/or optical temperature detector / indicator may optionally be<br>
coated with a protective varnish layer or protective foil preferably comprising<br>
polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, or polysulphone, and further, electrodes<br>
or similar elements for example using silver paste, may be printed on the detector<br>
/ indicator for possible resistance measurements.<br>
The colour change of said electrical and/or optical temperature detector / indicator<br>
may' be observed and determined either visually by comparing to a reference<br>
sample, or by an optical colour reader, moreover, a change in electrical<br>
conductivity may be measured electrically using a contact device by bringing an<br>
electrode close to the temperature detector / indicator, or further, using a non-<br>
contracting method wherein capacitance is measured, or the temperature detector /<br>
indicator is incorporated as a part into a Rf tag or RfID by covering it with said<br>
temperature detector / indicator and frequency characteristics are measured,<br>
and/or the temperature detector / indicator is othervise present as a part in a Rf tag<br>
or RID, and/or it otherwise detectably influence the operation of Rf tag or RID.<br>
Advantages of the electrical and/or optical temperature detector / indicator<br>
according to the present invention include adjustable electrical conductivity and<br>
temperature range as well as convenient and low-cost processibility making it also<br>
suitable for packages of everyday low-price consumer goods. The electrical and/or<br>
optical temperature detector / indicator according to the present invention is very<br>
suitable for controlling the cold chain of products since it indicates the<br>
temperatures, to which a product has been exposed. Product packages wherein the<br>
electrical and/or optical temperature detector / indicator according to the present<br>
invention has been incorporated, are able to transmit electronically a message<br>
corresponding to the state of the product by means of readers that may be<br>
incorporated in refrigerators, microwave ovens, or associated with other electrical<br><br>
appliances, for instance in households and stores, thus allowing the operation of<br>
said appliances to be controlled. Said electrical and/or optical temperature detector<br>
/ indicator for instance tells the household appliances whether the temperature<br>
limit was reached in a refrigerator or microwave oven.<br><br>
