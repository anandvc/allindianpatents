				<td>INK-JET INKS WHICH PREVENT KOGATION AND PROLONG RESISTOR<br>
LIFE IN INK-JET PENS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to ink compositions suitable for thermal ink-jet<br>
printing, and, more particularly, to ink compositions for preventing kogation and<br>
prolonging resistor life in ink-jet pens.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
[0002] The use of ink-jet printing systems has grown dramatically in recent years. This<br>
growth may be attributed to substantial improvements in print resolution and overall print<br>
quality coupled with appreciable reduction in cost. Today"s ink-jet printers offer<br>
acceptable print quality for many commercial, business, and household applications at<br>
costs fully an order of magnitude lower than comparable products available just a few<br>
years ago. Notwithstanding their recent success, intensive research and development<br>
efforts continue toward improving ink-jet print quality, while further lowering cost to the<br>
consumer.<br>
[0003] An ink-jet image is formed when a precise pattern of dots is ejected from a drop-<br>
generating device known as a "printhead" onto a printing medium. The typical ink-jet<br>
printhead has an array of precisely formed nozzles located on a nozzle plate and attached<br>
to an ink-jet printhead substrate. The substrate incorporates an array of firing chambers<br>
that receive liquid ink (colorants dissolved or dispersed in a solvent) through fluid<br>
communication with one or more ink reservoirs. Each chamber has a thin-film resistor,<br>
known as a "firing resistor," located opposite the nozzle so ink can collect between the<br>
firing resistor and the nozzle. In particular, each resistor element, which is typically a pad<br>
of a resistive material, measures about 35 .mu.m.times.35 .mu.m. The printhead is held<br>
and protected by an outer packaging referred to as a print cartridge, i.e., ink-jet pen.<br>
[0004] Upon energizing of a particular resistor element, a droplet of ink is expelled<br>
through the nozzle toward the print medium, whether paper, transparent film or the like.<br>
The firing of ink droplets is typically under the control of a microprocessor, the signals of<br>
which are conveyed by electrical traces to the resistor elements, thereby forming<br>
alphanumeric and other characters on the print medium.<br>
[0005] The small length scale of the nozzles, typically 10 to 40 .mu.m in diameter,<br>
require that the ink not clog the nozzles. Further, repeated firings of the resistor elements<br>
that must withstand many millions of firings over the life of the ink cartridge to be<br>
commercially practical, can result in fouling of the resistor elements and degrading pen<br>
performance. This build up of residue on the resistor elements is unique to thermal ink-jet<br>
printers and is known as kogation and defined as the build-up of residue (koga) on the<br>
resistor surface.<br>
[0006] Besides the problem of kogation, thermal ink-jet printer resistor surfaces are<br>
susceptible to passivation layer damage by cavitation, contamination and many other<br>
sources. Such passivation layer damage literally results in microscopic holes on the<br>
resistor surface which significantly shorten resistor life.<br>
[0007] Customer and profit demands require smaller drop volumes, color-laser-like ink<br>
permanence, and "permanent" print heads. Smaller drop volumes give better spatial and<br>
chroma resolutions. However, kogation appears to be worse in smaller drop volume pens.<br>
Smaller drop volumes also means that each resistor must fire a greater number of times to<br>
transfer the same amount of ink to the page. The greater number of firings required of the<br>
resistor results in more passivation layer damage.<br>
[0008] In spite of the increased pressure on kogation and passivation layer damage, the<br>
trend is towards longer print-head life, using pens with replaceable ink supplies such as<br>
(but not limited to) off-axis ink reservoirs that are connected to the pens by hoses and ink<br>
reservoirs that snap onto the print head. Infrequent need for replacement of the print<br>
heads with prolonged resistor life reduces the cost and servicing required of the customer.<br>
High-speed, high-throughput photocopier-like products that may be envisioned for the<br>
future will greatly increase ink usage and will most likely greatly push further the<br>
demands on print-head life. With higher pen-to-paper relative speeds, high-throughput<br>
products will be more sensitive to kogation induced drop velocity variations.<br>
[0009] It has been previously disclosed that oxyanions, especially phosphates, reduce<br>
kogation. The mechanism was attributed to the additive eliminating or reducing<br>
adsorption of dye and/or decomposition products onto the resistor. Furthermore, the<br>
phosphate ester disclosed for kogation control are short chain phosphate ester, not long-<br>
chained, surface active phosphate ester as in the present invention. It has also been<br>
disclosed that organic acid sulfonate, such as sodium methane sulfonate, and bile sail<br>
(e.g., sodium cholate) additives can be used for reducing kogation. Other disclosed ways<br>
of achieving kogation control are, for example, macrocyclic polyethers to complex<br>
cations in ink-jet ink compositions; isopropanol/water rinse to remove phosphate<br>
antistatic material from ink foam; and removing koga by various mechnical means such<br>
as applying pressure to the channels of the ink-jet pen or dry-firing the resistor. Recently,<br>
it has been disclosed that phytic acid in ink-jet ink can be used to reduce foreign matter<br>
deposits on a surface of an ink-jet heating head.<br>
[0010] The use of phosphate ester in ink-jet inks has also been disclosed. However, such<br>
disclosures only show the general utility of phosphate ester to produce a surfactant effect,<br>
such as for improved water-fastness, and do not propose phosphate ester as a solution to<br>
the problem of kogation or passivation layer damage.<br>
[0011] The use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to capture calcium for<br>
improving the problem of crusting/decap (i.e., formation of ink precipitate either in the<br>
pen nozzle or immediately outside the pen nozzle due to exposure of ink to air) in ink-jet<br>
inks has also been disclosed. Furthermore, above 100 ppm EDTA was found to erode<br>
away the resistor coating, while a slight amount of EDTA was asserted to have the<br>
positive effect of preventing a large amount of the koga from adhering to the resistor<br>
surface, thus maintaining the resistor surface in a smooth state.<br>
[0012] Nitrate and phosphate ions have been used in ink-jet ink compositions to prevent<br>
kogation. In ink-jet pens currently on the market, these two solutions have proved to have<br>
little benefit and substantial drawbacks. Both nitrate and phosphate ions have potential<br>
health and environmental complications and phosphate ion has been shown to etch the<br>
tantalum surfaces of resistors in ink-jet pens. Something is therefore needed to reduce<br>
kogation on ink-jet resistors which does not have the negative effects that accompany<br>
nitrate and phosphate ions.<br>
[0013] Even though some kogation and/or passivation layer damage control methods in<br>
ink-jet ink pens are known, all of them are either limited in their effectiveness, are not<br>
economically feasible or have undesirable side effects for pens needing long resistor life.<br>
Thus, there is even more of a need to find a way to effectively deal with the problem of<br>
kogation and passivation layer damage on ink-jet resistors.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0032] The invention described herein is directed to ink-jet inks for printing ink-jet<br>
images using commercially available ink-jet printers such as, for example but not limited<br>
to, HP DeskJet.RTM. printers, manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Company, of Palo Alto,<br>
Calif. The inks enable production of near photographic images having little or no<br>
coalescence, excellent waterfastness, and reduced dry time, on a range of print media, in<br>
particular, for example but not limited to, plain white, 81/2.times.l 1", 20 lb. weight,<br>
printer paper conventionally used for office and home computers.<br>
[0033] As stated above in the background, something is needed to reduce kogation on<br>
ink-jet resistors which does not have the negative effects that accompany nitrate and<br>
phosphate ions. Applicants have found that phosphate ester in ink-jet inks create a<br>
beneficial microsurface on the tantalum layer of the ink-jet resistor. This microsurface<br>
has the effect of preventing passivation layer damage of the resistor by decreasing pitting<br>
and etching on the resistor surface as well as preventing kogation. This combination of<br>
protection of the resistor surface from etching and pitting as well as preventing kogation<br>
has the overall effect of improving resistance to early life failure of resistors, especially<br>
when compared to the effect of using phosphate, nitrate ion and the use of no ion at all.<br>
The combination of phosphate ester with chelating agents provides even greater kogation<br>
prevention by preventing the formation of precipitates of phosphate ester surfactants"with<br>
free metal ions in pens and by preventing precipitation of the colorants with free metals.<br>
[0034] The use of phosphate ester with or without chelating agent provides the best<br>
kogation resistance and improvement in the rate of resistor failure seen to date of all<br>
known solutions involving additives to normal ink components. One can diminish<br>
kogation by choosing water-soluble dyes, but this has the disadvantage of providing less<br>
image permanence under wet conditions.<br>
[0035] Kogation is considered a "charring" of ink components on the resistor surface in a<br>
thermal-inkjet pen, leading to a buildup of a deposit on the resistor that is visible under an<br>
optical microscope. This deposit, or "koga," results in a loss of both drop velocity and<br>
drop weight. The koga either disrupts even growth of the vapor-drive bubble by<br>
providing low energy nucleation sites, or interferes with heat transfer by acting as a<br>
thermal insulator. A loss of drop weight over the life of the pen reduces the chroma or<br>
optical density of the ink on the paper and thus degrades print quality. A loss of drop<br>
weight over the life of the pen reduces the accuracy of drop placement on the paper and<br>
thus degrades print quality.<br>
[0036] Addition of a surface-active phosphate ester to a thermal-inkjet ink prevents or<br>
reduces kogation and passivation layer damage and can prolong resistor life. However,<br>
the kogation/passivation layer damage prevention power of the surface-active phosphate<br>
ester is greater if combined with a metal chelating agent such as EDTA. In addition,<br>
surface-active phosphate ester tend to form gummy precipitates with metal ions,<br>
especially aluminum and trivalent iron ions even at low bulk concentrations around 1<br>
ppm. By chelating the metal ions the formation of salts with the phosphate head-group of<br>
the surface-active phosphate ester is prevented and ink is less susceptible to metal ion<br>
contamination. Furthermore, surface-active phosphate ester form viscous precipitates<br>
with organotin compounds, especially with those from dioctyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin<br>
dilaurate. By chelating the organotin compounds with a chelator such as 2,6-<br>
pyridinedicarboxylic acid (a.k.a. dipicoline acid), aminodiacetic acid and 2-pydine<br>
carboxylic acid (Picoline Acid) (structures shown in FIG. 17), the formation of the<br>
viscous precipitate is prevented.<br>
[0037] Resistors in thermal-inkjet pens are coated first with passivation layers that<br>
electrically and chemically protect the resistor from the ink. On top of these passivation<br>
layers is a hard refractory or noble metal layer, for example, titanium, zirconium,<br>
hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, gold, silver<br>
and platinum, preferably, tantalum, that minimizes cavitation damage to the resistor<br>
during the vapor drive-bubble collapse. A soak of a tantalum surface in an ink containing<br>
a surface-active phosphate ester followed by a water rinse produces a surface with a<br>
higher contact angle with water (more hydrophobic) than the original surface. This is<br>
probably because phosphate headgroups chemi-sorb to the tantalum, leaving the<br>
hydrocarbon tails "sticking-out" away from the tantalum. Though it is difficult to be sure<br>
of the exact mechanism for the kogation prevention, it is believed the surface-active<br>
phosphate ester reduces adsorption of dyes and other ink components onto the tantalum<br>
resistor coating. This prevents surface reactions on the tantalum that would degrade the<br>
adsorbed ink components into insoluble deposits, e.g., koga. It also prevents wearing<br>
away of the tantalum layer resulting in damage to the passivation layer, thus prolonging<br>
the life of the resistor.<br>
[0038] Metal ions promote kogation by either forming precipitates with the dyes or other<br>
ink components or by acting as catalysts in degradation reactions. Strong effects are seen<br>
for trivalent metal ions such as iron (III), aluminum and chromium (III). The kogation<br>
effect of iron (III) and aluminum appears to be much stronger in the presence of a<br>
surface-active phosphate ester most likely due to the strong interaction of the metal with<br><br>
the phosphate headgroup.<br>
[0039] Sources of metal ions include impurities in the raw materials, catalysts used in<br>
dye synthesis, corrosion of pen filling equipment and corrosion of metal parts within the<br>
pens. Corrosion is a particular concern because it can result in locally high metals<br>
concentrations that can precipitate the surface-active phosphate ester. These precipitates<br>
can clog print-head nozzles.<br>
[0040] Organotin compounds promote nozzle clogging by forming viscous precipitates<br>
with surface-active phosphate ester. Sources of organotin compounds include catalysts<br>
used in the synthesis of polymeric pen materials and polymeric adhesives.<br>
[0041] In one embodiment, the present invention relates to an ink-jet ink composition for<br>
reducing kogation and prolonging ink-jet pen life comprising at least one colorant; and an<br>
aqueous vehicle, the vehicle comprising at least one refractory or noble metal-reactive<br>
component in an amount sufficient, when the composition is used in an ink-jet pen, to<br>
form a protective thin layer on an outer layer of a resistor surface of the ink-jet pen, the<br>
outer layer comprising a refractory or noble metal, the refractory or noble metal being<br>
selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium,<br>
tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, gold, silver and platinum.<br>
[0042] In a preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the refractory or noble<br>
metal-reactive component for preventing kogation and prolong resistor life is from 0.1 to<br>
3% by weight of the ink composition. In a more preferred embodiment, for preventing<br>
kogation, the refractory or noble metal-reactive component is from 0.2 to 0.5% by weight<br>
of the ink composition. In another more preferred embodiment, for prolonging resistor<br>
life, the refractory or noble metal-reactive component is from 0.5 to 3% by weight of the<br>
ink composition.<br>
[0043] In another preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the at least one<br>
refractory or noble metal-reactive component of the above-described ink-jet ink<br><br>
composition comprises phosphate ester.<br>
[0044] In a more preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the phosphate<br>
ester have the structure<br><br>
where R is a branched hydrocarbon, unbranched hydrocarbon, or perfluoronated<br>
hydrocarbon with at least eight carbons; E is an ethyoxy group (--CH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 O--<br>
); X is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and Y is an integer from 1 to 3.<br>
[0045] In yet another more preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the<br>
refractory or noble metal coating the outer layer of the resistor surface is tantalum.<br>
[0046] Applicants have found that low drop volume domains are more prone to kogation.<br>
It follows that the benefits of kogation control with phosphate ester, metal chelators<br>
and/or organometal chelators on the function and longevity of small drop volume pens<br>
are especially significant. Therefore, in another preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink<br>
composition, the ink-jet pen has a minimum drop volume range of from 1 to 10 picoliters.<br>
In yet a more preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the ink-jet pen has a<br>
minimum drop volume range of from 3 to 6 picoliters.<br>
[0047] In still another preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the ink-jet<br>
pen can be fired at least 50 million times without being replaced and in a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the ink-jet pen can be fired at least 100 million times without being<br>
replaced. In another preferred embodiment, ink in the ink-jet pen is refillable.<br>
[0048] In yet another preferred embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the at least<br>
one colorant is selected from a group consisting of a dye and a pigment.<br>
[0049] In still another embodiment of the ink-jet ink composition, the aqueous vehicle<br>
further comprises at least one chelating agent and in a more preferred embodiment, the at<br>
least one chelating agent is from 0.1 to 1% by weight of the ink composition.<br><br>

SURFACTANT<br>
[0063] Surfactants suitably employed in the practice of the invention include anionic and<br>
nonionic surfactants. Examples of anionic surfactants include: Sulfonate surfactants such<br>
as Sulfosuccinates (Aerosol OT, A196; AY and GP, available from CYTEC) and<br>
Sulfonates (Aerosol DPOS45, OS available from CYTEC; Witconate C-50H available<br>
from WITCO; Dowfax 8390 available from DOW); and Fluoro surfactants (Fluorad<br>
FC99C available from 3M). Examples of nonionic surfactants include: Fluoro surfactants<br>
(Fluorad FC170C available from 3M); Alkoxylate surfactants (Tergitol series 15S-5,<br>
15S-7, and 15S-9 available from Union Carbide); and Organosilicone surfactants (Silwet<br>
L-77 and L-76-9 available from WITCO). These surfactants provide the necessary dot<br>
spread on plain paper and special media, such as photobase glossy paper, for providing<br>
excellent image quality.<br>
COLORANTS<br>
[0064] The inks made according to the present invention comprise at least one colorant,<br>
preferably at least one dye. The amount of dye added to the vehicle in prior compositions<br>
and the inventive compositions tend to be a function of choice, and is largely dependent<br>
upon solubility of the dye in the vehicle and the color intensity of the dye. Typical<br>
amounts of dye are between about 0.1 wt % to about 10 wt % of ink composition,<br>
preferably, between about 0.1 and 5 wt %. In compositions of the invention, the dye is<br><br>
preferably colored rather than black, although any of the dyes used in inks for in-jet<br>
printers may be employed. Illustrative suitable dyes include Direct Blue 199 (available<br>
from Avecia as Projet Cyan Special), Acid Blue 9; Direct Red 9, Direct Red 227,<br>
Magenta 377 (available from Ilford AG, Rue de I"lndustrie, CH-1700 Fribourg,<br>
Switzerland), Acid Yellow 23, Direct Yellow 132, Direct Yellow 86, Yellow 104 (Ilford<br>
AG), Direct Yellow 4 (BASF), Yellow PJY H-3RNA (Avecia), and Direct Yellow 50<br>
(Avecia). More preferably, Direct Blue 199, Magenta 377, and Ilford Yellow 104 are<br>
employed as the cyan, magenta, and the yellow colorants. Although in a preferred<br>
embodiment, the invention is directed to dye-based ink, addition of surface active<br>
phosphate ester would also provide benefit to pigment-based ink.<br>

Example 10<br>
[0084] Addition of 0.10% EDTA virtually eliminated the kogation problems in a bad lot<br>
of HR4C with excess chromium on the order of 2-3 ppm. EDTA addition should in<br>
general help the ink tolerance to several transition metals. HR4C is an ink, which in<br>
addition to cyan dyes contains (in a typical, non-limiting embodiment): 4.00% Succinic<br>
Acid; 2.50% Mackam.RTM. OCT50 (a trademark of Mclntyre Group Limited Corp.);<br>
0.50% phosphate ester surfactant N-3 Acid; 0.50% Tergitol.RTM. 15-S-5 (a trademark of<br>
Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Company); 10.19% Pentane Diol; 9.56% 2-<br>
Pyrrolidone; 4.25% Tetraethylene glycol; and balance water. HR4C does not contain a<br><br>
metal chelating agent such as EDTA. Previously anomalous kogation in a particular lot of<br>
HR4C had been traced to excess chromium in the dye concentrate. The net chromium<br>
content in the ink was 2-3 ppm. A catalyst used in the dye synthesis was the source of the<br>
chromium.<br>
[0085] Because of the sensitivity of kogation to metals, the concentrations of free metals<br>
must be limited in the inks. But tight specifications on the ink purity to limit the<br>
concentration of metals would add to manufacturing costs because it is difficult to protect<br>
against inadvertent contamination from the pen filling equipment (such as from corroding<br>
metal fittings) and from corrosion inside the pen.<br>
[0086] 0.10% EDTA is added to the "bad" lot of HR4C with the intent of increasing the<br>
metal tolerance of the inks. Rather than a deliberate addition (or "spiking") of<br>
contamination in the ink, the chromium contamination in the "bad" lot represents a true<br>
ink manufacturing variation. The results of the experiment show that EDTA dramatically<br>
helps control kogation with the "bad" cyan lot. Without EDTA, the drop velocities<br>
degraded quickly with a small number of firings. With EDTA the drop velocities were<br>
relatively constant and not reduced by kogation. The koga is virtually eliminated on<br>
resistors fired up to 200 million drops with four different pens (See FIG. 9). In contrast,<br>
the control pens without EDTA have severe koga build up. (See FIG. 10). FIG. 11 is a<br>
photograph of a resistor fired 200 million drops of HR4C without EDTA. FIG. 12 is a<br>
photograph of a resistor fired 200 million drops of HR4C with 0.10% EDTA.<br>
Example 11<br>
[0087] Spiking experiments are useful to determine the sensitivity of the various metals<br>
that may be added as impurities in the formulation, carried over from ink manufacturing<br>
or produced as corrosion products in the pens and ink supplies. A loss of drop weight<br>
over the life of the pen reduces the accuracy of drop placement on the paper and thus<br>
degrades print quality. Therefore, the consistency of the drop velocity can be used as a<br>
measure of potential print quality. To quantify metal sensitivities, linear regression was<br><br>
applied to the average drop velocity data for resistors fired 50, 100 and 200 MDPN from<br>
metal spiked HR4M ink. HR4M is an ink, which in addition to magenta dyes contains (in<br>
a typical, non-limiting embodiment): 5.00% Succinic Acid; 2.50% Mackam<br>
OCT50.RTM; 0.50% phosphate ester surfactant N-3 Acid; 0.50% Tergitol 15-S-5.RTM;<br>
9.6% Pentane Diol; 7.00% 2-Pyrrolidone; 2.50% Tetraethylene glycol; and balance<br>
water. HR4M does not contain a metal chelating agent such as EDTA. A 1 m/s velocity<br>
decrease is predicted at the following metal concentrations: 0.2 ppm Cr, 1.3 ppm Al, and<br>
2.5 ppm Fe. Therefore, the metal tolerance is low and addition of a chelating agent to the<br>
inks will be important. In these experiments, Na.sub.2 EDTA at 0.10% was also shown-to<br>
control both the aluminum and iron. HR4M contains phosphate ester surfactant N-3 Acid<br>
but no chelating agent for metal ions.<br>
HR4M was spiked with the nitrate salts of aluminum, chromium and iron (III). For one<br>
ink a nominal amount of 0.10% disodium EDTA was added to the ink to chelate the<br>
aluminum and iron ions. Pen performance was quantified by drop velocity measurement<br>
after firing different sets of resistors with increasing number of drops. Pens were run at<br>
30% over energy.<br>
[0088] To help summarize the data, average velocities were calculated for the velocity<br>
data at 50, 100 and 200 Million Drops Per Nozzle (MPDN). (See FIG. 13) A measure of<br>
the "dose-response" was calculated by linear regression with the y-intercept fixed at the<br>
average of the velocities of the control pens. When there is a 1 m/s decrease in the drop<br>
velocity, on the order of 0.2 ppm Cr, 1.3 ppm Al and 2.5 ppm Fe can be tolerated.<br>
[0089] Chromium clearly has the stronger effect and causes a significant increase in the<br>
drop velocity variability. Also shown on the graph are the velocity data for pens with<br>
0.10% EDTA with 3.3 ppm Al and 4 ppm Fe. The EDTA markedly improves the drop<br>
velocity. One pen has a lower drop velocity that may be due more to pen variations than a<br>
metals effect. In inks comprising EDTA or other metal chelating agents the metals<br>
tolerance before a kogation effect is found will be much greater compared to inks without<br>
metal chelating agents.<br><br>
Example 12<br>
[0090] HR5Y is distinguished from HR4Y primarily by the addition of 0.10% EDTA.<br>
HR4Y is an ink, which in addition to yellow dyes contains (in a typical, non-limiting<br>
embodiment): 3.03% Succinic Acid; 2.50% Mackam.RTM. OCT50; 0.50% phosphate<br>
ester surfactant N-3 Acid; 0.73% Tergitol.RTM. 15-S-5; 5.92% Pentane Diol; 9.56% 2-<br>
Pyrrolidone; 3.25% Tetraethylene glycol; and balance water. HR4Y does not contain a<br>
metal chelating agent such as EDTA. Nozzle clogs in pens with HR4Y ink are due to a<br>
"gummy precipitate" composed of an iron-phosphate ester surfactant salt. Experimental<br>
results show that EDTA considerably reduces the effect of ferric precipitate at relatively<br>
high spiking levels if sufficient time is allowed for the metal digestion. Given that the<br>
"gummy precipitate" takes some time to form in the pen, EDTA chelation of the free<br>
metals can compete with the precipitation reaction of the free metals with the surface-<br>
active phosphate ester.<br>

[0091] Samples were initially prepared by addition of a .about. 1%<br>
Fe(NO.sub.3).sub.3.9H.sub.2 O salt solution to the ink samples in glass test tubes. In all<br>
samples, a precipitate immediately formed upon dripping the solution onto the ink and<br>
persisted after mixing. After 4 hours the 4062-6-4 sample became much clearer; the<br>
background cloudiness disappeared with only the larger particles persisting. The 4062-6-<br>
5 was still cloudy at this time but less than the 4062-3 sample.<br>
[0092] After 10 days the 4062-64 and 4062-6-5 samples were more or less clear. Selected<br><br>
samples were filtered through a 0.2 .mu.m pore-size syringe filter attached to a 10 ml<br>
syringe. In filtering the 4062-6-2 sample, only .about.2 ml could be pressed through the<br>
filter before the filter was blocked. Water through the same filter had considerable<br>
resistance because the filter pores were irreversibly blocked by the gummy precipitate.<br>
Both the 4062-6-4 and -5 samples could be pressed through the filter with some<br>
resistance and the heavier spiked sample with more resistance. Water passed through the<br>
same filters with little resistance, showing that the pores were not blocked by a gummy<br>
precipitate. The filtration results demonstrate the negative effect of precipitation of free<br>
metal ions with the surface-active phosphate ester and chelation of the free metal ions<br>
with EDTA can eliminate the precipitation.<br>
Example 13<br>
[0093] The surface-active phosphate ester in HR4Y and HR5Y inks (specifically the<br>
ester is phosphate ester surfactant N-3 Acid) forms gummy precipitates when combined<br>
with free metal ions, especially aluminum, iron or some combination. The EDTA metal<br>
chelator in the HR5Y (HR4Y does not contain EDTA) binds up the metal ions and<br>
prevents the gummy precipitate from forming.<br>
[0094] Iron and aluminum nitrate solutions in water were prepared (1.0 and 1.4%,<br>
respectively) and added to weighted amounts of the two inks in test tubes with screw<br>
caps. The relative amounts are shown below with the "A" samples being HR4Y and the<br>
"B" samples being HR5Y. Mole ratios of metals to EDTA and phosphate ester surfactant<br>
are also indicated. In no case did the number of moles of metal exceed the moles of<br>
EDTA. Spiking with calcium does not produce a precipitate unless high concentrations<br>
(&gt;100 ppm) are used and the precipitate in this case is primarily a calcium slat of the dye<br>
rather than with the surface-active phosphate ester. The 9A and B samples were not<br>
spiked to provide controls for visual observations.<br><br>

[0095] Metal solutions were added to the ink in the test tubes with pipettes. Because of<br>
the high concentrations at the top before mixing, precipitate formed in all samples.<br>
Samples were aged overnight at 60.degree. C. to help bring the samples to equilibrium, to<br>
let the metal ions exchange from the precipitate to an EDTA complex. After aging, all of<br>
the HR4Y (the "A" samples) had varying amounts of cloudiness or precipitate in<br>
proportion to the amount of metal added. All of the HR5Y samples containing 0.10%<br>
EDTA in the formulation were indistinguishable from the 9B control sample without<br>
added metals. Therefore, HR5Y is much more robust against Fe and Al metal impurities.<br><br>
Example 14<br>
[0096] Under certain conditions the surface-active phosphate ester forms a precipitate<br>
that blocks the ink-jet pen nozzle in spite of the presence of EDTA metal chelator in the<br>
ink. Precipitates causing nozzle clogs were characterized by Fourier Transform Infra-Red<br>
(FTIR) microscopy to obtain a "fingerprint" spectrum that showed characteristics of<br>
phosphate ester surfactant N-3 Acid, the surface-active phosphate ester in HR5Y ink. The<br>
precipitate had the appearance of a viscous oil and was also found to contain phosphate<br>
and tin. The precipitate was shown to be an interaction between the surface active<br>
phosphate ester and dioctyltin dilaurate formulated in the adhesive of nozzle tape as a<br>
polymerization catalyst.<br>
[0097] Spiking HR5Y with dibutyltin dilaurate reproduced essential features of the IR<br>
spectrum of the viscous oil-like precipitate. To promote the reaction, the spiked sample<br>
(0.16% dibutyltin dilaurate) was heated at 90.degree. C. for two days in a test tube with a<br>
threaded cap. Initially the dibutyltin dilaurate floated on top of the ink with an oil-like<br>
appearance. After the heating an oil-like substance was found on the bottom of the test<br>
tube. Ink was poured out of the test tube with the "oil" adhering to the bottom of the tube.<br>
The sample was rinsed several times with water and transferred to a silicon wafer for IR<br>
analysis.<br>
[0098] As shown in the spectra in FIG. 14, in the heteroatom stretching region (below<br>
.about.2000 cm.sup.-1) the spectrum of the bottom "oil" showed a reasonable match to<br>
viscous oil-like precipitate that was found in the pen and formed by the reaction of the<br>
surface-active phosphate ester with the dioctyltin dilaurate catalyst which had leached<br>
from the nozzle adhesive. Additional peaks around 1710 cm.sup.-1 and 1600 cm.sup.-1<br>
that are not seen in the viscous oil-like precipitate show a good match in shape and<br>
position to peaks in the dibutyltin dilaurate impurity from unreacted spiking material.<br>
[0099] Though not very apparent in the spectra shown in FIG. 14, the CH.sub.2<br>
stretching strengths are relatively stronger in the spectrum of the viscous oil-like<br><br>
precipitate made by interaction of the tape with the ink than the spectra of the spike-<br>
created sample. The longer hydrocarbon substitutions are consistent with the differences<br>
in the hydrocarbon stretching strengths of dioctyltin dilaurate relative to those of<br>
dibutyltin dilaurate.<br>
Example 15<br>
[0100] The viscous oil-like precipitate is due to a precipitation reaction between<br>
dioctyltin dilaurate catalyst in the tape and the surface-active phosphate ester added into<br>
the ink to provide kogation protection. A chelating agent for the organotin can prevent<br>
this precipitation and nozzle blockage. Chelating agents for organotin were tested in test<br>
tube experiments with HR5Y ink spiked with dibutyltin dilaurate. A chelating agent must<br>
bind more strongly to the organotin and the surface-active phosphate ester to prevent the<br>
formation of the viscous oil-like precipitate. The 2,6 pyridinedicarboxylic acid was found<br>
to be an effective chelator for the organotin. Additional EDTA, the chelator already<br>
formulated in the HR5Y ink, did not have any beneficial effect against the organotin.<br>
[0101] The reaction producing viscous oil-like precipitate in HR5Y occurs under<br>
accelerated storage life conditions at temperatures as low as 40.degree. C. Some of the<br>
viscous oil-like precipitate can be blown out of the pen during initial servicing of the pen<br>
on start up. However a few nozzles remain blocked. A replacement tape without the<br>
organotin catalyst in the adhesive may not have the same balance of material properties<br>
as the current nozzle tape. The surface-active phosphate ester additive is needed to<br>
prevent kogation and prolong resistor life.<br>
[0102] One solution for correcting viscous oil-like precipitate without removing the<br>
phosphate ester surfactant or changing the tape is the addition of a chelating agent that<br>
bonds more strongly to the organotin than phosphate ester surfactant. EDTA is already<br>
added to the HR5 inks. Because the tin is in an organo form not a tin salt, the EDTA is<br>
not an effective chelating agent, presumably because the alkyl groups sterically interfere<br><br>
with the multi-dentate binding of the EDTA. An additional chelator specifically for the<br>
organotin would have to be added to the ink. Candidates include rigid ring structures in<br>
which bonding to the organotin has less of an entropy penalty and can lock into the tin in<br>
between the covalently attached alkyl chains.<br>
For testing chelation, dibutyltin dilaurate was used in place of the dioctyltin dilaurate<br>
reported to be formulated in the tape. The dibutyltin form is a reasonable substitute for<br>
spiking experiments and is predicted to have a very similar reaction chemistry.<br>
[0103] A ~about.0.2% mixture of dibutyltin dilaurate in HR5Y ink was prepared. The<br>
spiked ink is vigorously mixed with a magnetic stirrer. Weighed amounts of potential<br>
chelators (or dispersing aids) are added to capped test tubes. The ink is then separated<br>
into the test tubes and placed overnight in the 90.degree. C. oven. The following day<br>
samples are evaluated by observing the tubes in front of a light source.<br>
[0104] Addition of disodium EDTA well above stoichiometric concentrations had no<br>
effect on the viscous oil-like precipitate formation, confirming that EDTA is not an<br>
appropriate chelator for organotin.<br>
[0105] The 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (a.k.a. dipicoline acid) worked well for<br>
organotin chelation but the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate-dibutyltin complex does have a<br>
limited solubility at room temperature. When the test tube containing this chelator was<br>
removed from the oven, the ink was completely clear without a trace of the viscous oil-<br>
like precipitate. However, about an hour after cooling to room temperature, the ink<br>
became cloudy and a fine white precipitate settled to the bottom of the tube. In a series of<br>
test tubes with different amounts of the chelator added but the same amount of organotin,<br>
the amount of precipitate was roughly constant, suggesting the precipitate is the<br>
organotin-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate complex rather than undissolved chelator. The<br>
filtrate of the ink was characterized by IR spectroscopy and compared to the starting<br>
chelator material (see FIGS. 15 and 16). The IR spectrum of the filtrate looks like a salt<br>
of the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid. Also considered was precipitation of the lauric acid<br><br>
byproduct but this does not agree with the IR spectrum of the precipitate.<br>
[0106] Precipitation of the complex with the organotin may or may not be a problem.<br>
Additions of dibutyltin dilaurate as low as 0.2% is still well above the solubility even at<br>
90.degree. C. For the dioctyltin dilaurate in the tape, the solubility is expected to be even<br>
less. It is possible that the addition of less than 40 ppm or less of a chelating agent is<br>
enough to correct the viscous oil-like precipitate problem.<br>
[0107] It is interesting that chelators with related structures were not effective (see FIG-<br>
17). Aminodiacetic acid did not eliminate the viscous oil-like precipitate. Perhaps in the<br>
case of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, having the carboxylate groups attached to a rigid<br>
aromatic ring reduces some of the entropy penalty of chelating the organotin. Picoline<br>
acid with only one carboxylate group also did not work, suggesting the multi-dentation is<br>
important in the stronger chelation ability of the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid.<br>
[0108] The chelator with the acid and amine groups on one side of the aromatic ring is<br>
potentially very surface active on the tantalum surface and it is thought that the chelator<br>
can have strong effects on resistor health by etching away the tantalum. As a quick check,<br>
HR5Y inks with different amounts of 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid has no effect on the<br>
drop velocity; even up to the 1070 ppm concentration; the drop velocity behavior is for<br>
the most part the same as the control. Even after pens were fired 200 million drops per<br>
nozzle with ink containing up to 1070 ppm of the chelator, there was no evidence of the<br>
tantalum resistor coating being eroded by high concentrations of the chelator.<br>
[0109] The reagent, 1,2-pyridylazo-2-naphthol, is a "metallizing" dye which turns from a<br>
pale yellow to a dark red after reacting with the organotin. The dye has a poor solubility<br>
in the ink and may not be an appropriate chelator because of its color except if used in<br>
very sparing amounts. Another metallizing dye, pyrocatecholl violet can also chelate<br>
organotin in the presence of the surface-active phosphate ester.<br>
Example 16<br><br>
[0110] The viscous oil-like precipitate is due to a precipitation reaction between<br>
dioctyltin dilaurate in the nozzle tape and the surface-active phosphate ester added in the<br>
HR5Y ink. A chelating agent for the organotin such as 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid can<br>
prevent this precipitation and nozzle blockage.<br>
Three lots of ink were produced by the addition of different quantities of the organotin<br>
chelating agent to HR5Y ink. Lot 1 was the control ink without an addition of the<br>
organotin chelating agent. Lot 2 and Lot 3 had 20 and 40 ppm respectively of the 2,6-<br>
pyridinedicarboxylic acid organotin chelator added to the ink. Pens were filled with the<br>
different inks and taped with nozzle tape containing dioctyltin dilaurate in the adhesive.<br>
The pens were pouched in air-impermeable bags and stored nozzles up in 60.degree. C.<br>
ovens for 2 weeks. The elevated temperature storage simulates long-term aging of the<br>
pens by speeding reaction times. Upon removal from the oven, pens were printed to<br>
detect pens with missing nozzles. The pens with missing nozzles were printed 190,000<br>
drops per nozzles and examined a second time for missing nozzles that had not been<br>
cleared during the printing.<br>
[0111] The control set of pens (34 pens total) filled with the Lot 1 ink had two pens with<br>
nozzles out due to contamination that had the appearance under the light microscope of<br>
the viscous oil-like precipitate. A total of five nozzles were affected. The FTIR spectrum<br>
of the precipitate taken from one of the pens matched the spectrum of the viscous oil-like<br>
precipitate formed from the precipitation reaction between the dioctyltin dilaurate in the<br>
tape and the surface-active phosphate ester.<br>
[0112] The second pen set (35 pens total) filled with Lot 2 ink comprised of 20 ppm of<br>
the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid had no pens affected by the viscous oil-like precipitate.<br>
Only one nozzle of one pen was blocked, it was determined that the affected nozzle was<br>
blocked by an air bubble, which may be cleared in the normal servicing of a pen in a<br>
normal printer device.<br><br>
[0113] The third set of pens (35 pens total) filled with Lot 3 ink comprising 40 ppm of<br>
the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid had no pens affected by the viscous oil-like precipitate.<br>
One pen had one nozzle with a solid substance clogging the nozzle. By FTIR analysis this<br>
solid substance was confirmed to be the precipitate of the organotin-chelator complex of<br>
dioctyltin and the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid organotin chelator.<br>
[0114] Addition of the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid organotin chelator at 40 and 30 ppm<br>
can completely eliminate the formation of the viscous oil-like precipitate. A solid<br>
substance that can block nozzles forms by the precipitation of the chelation complex. The<br>
precipitation of the organotin chelator complex can be prevented or minimized by the use<br>
of an organotin chelator that forms a more soluble organotin-chelator complex or by the<br>
use of small concentrations of the organotin chelator in order to reduce the rate of<br>
reaction of the organotin chelator with the organotin and to allow time for the organotin-<br>
chelator complex to diffuse into the bulk ink away from the nozzle channels before the<br>
solubility limit is reached.<br>
Example 17<br>
[0115] In order to test the effect of phosphate ester on resistor life in thermal ink-jet pens,<br>
100 pens were filled with HR3Y ink with 3% phosphate ester surfactant and 100 pens<br>
were filled with HR3Y ink with only 0.5% phosphate ester surfactant. HR3Y is an ink,<br>
which in addition to yellow dyes contains (in a typical, non-limiting embodiment): 1.94%<br>
Succinic Acid; 6.00% Pentane Diol; 10.22% 2-Pyrrolidone; EHPD 4.25%; and balance<br>
water. HR3Y does not contain a metal chelating agent such as EDTA. All pens were<br>
resistor-life tested to 200 million drops per nozzle. Over 50% of the pens with 0.5%<br>
phosphate ester surfactant had one or more resistor failures at 200 MDPN. None of the<br>
100 pens with 3% phosphate ester surfactant had resistor failures by 200 MDPN.<br>
Example 18<br>
[0116] Eight 6.0 picoliter ink-jet pens and eight 2.7 picoliter ink-jet pens were filled with<br><br>
RR2C ink and resistance-life tested at 30% OE. RR2C is an ink, which in addition to<br>
cyan dyes contains (in a typical, non-limiting embodiment): 3.9% Butanediol; 3.2%<br>
Neopentyl glycol; 2.0% Multranol 4012; 1.6% Dantocol DHE; 0.55% Dowfax 8390;<br>
0.5% Silwett L77; 0.5% Tergitol 15-S-7; 0.2% MOPS-buffer; 0.2% Proxel GXL-biocide<br>
and balance water. Pens were removed from the test for a drop weight loss of 10% below<br>
the original drop weight or when they had exceeded 500 MDPN. Three of the eight 2.7<br>
picoliter pens failed for drop weight loss before 500 MDPN, while none of the eight 6.0<br>
picoliter pens failed before 500 MDPN. However, an autopsy of the 6.0 picoliter pens<br>
after firing 500 MDPN clearly showed the same kogation formation on the resistor<br>
surface as the 2.7 pL pens. Both the 2.7 picoliter and 6.0 picoliter pens show a steady<br>
decline in drop weight with the number of drops fired. But the 2.7 picoliter pens failed<br>
earlier in life than the 6.0 picoliter pens, showing that the 6.0 picoliter pens continue to<br>
function longer in spite of kogation than the 2.7 picoliter pens.<br>
