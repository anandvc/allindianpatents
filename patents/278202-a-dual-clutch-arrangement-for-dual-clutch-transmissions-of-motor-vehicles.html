				<td>Dual clutch arrangement<br>
The present invention relates to a dual clutch arrangement for a dual clutch trans-<br>
mission for motor vehicles, having<br>
- 	a first and a second friction clutch which are each fluidically actuable,<br>
-	a first piston arrangement which serves to actuate the first friction clutch and<br>
has a first piston, a first piston space and a first centrifugal force equalizing<br>
space,<br>
-	a second piston arrangement which serves to actuate the second friction<br>
clutch and has a second piston, a second piston space and a second centrifu-<br>
gal force equalizing space,<br>
-	with the piston spaces and the centrifugal force equalizing spaces being<br>
situated in each case on opposite sides of the associated piston and being<br>
connected by means of feed lines to a valve arrangement.<br>
A dual clutch arrangement of said type is generally known.<br>
 <br>
2<br>
Dual clutch transmissions have a dual clutch arrangement and two partial transmis-<br>
sions. The partial transmissions are generally designed as layshaft transmissions.<br>
Here, one of the partial transmissions is assigned to the even gear stages, and the<br>
other partial transmission is assigned to the odd gear stages.<br>
It is consequently possible, by means of overlapping actuation of the two clutches of<br>
the dual clutch arrangement, to carry out a gearshift without an interruption in<br>
tractive force.<br>
Said type of dual clutch transmission is suitable for motor vehicles, in particular for<br>
passenger vehicles.<br>
Nowadays, fluidically operated friction clutches, for example wet-running multiplate<br>
clutches, are generally used in dual clutch arrangements.<br>
It is often preferable here, in order to attain a short axial design, for the two dual<br>
clutches to be nested one inside the other radially, with one friction clutch being<br>
situated radially at the inside and the other being situated radially at the outside.<br>
In order to supply fluid, in particular hydraulic oil, to the friction clutches, it is<br>
known to provide a rotary leadthrough with a spigot section onto which is placed a<br>
common hub of the two dual clutches.<br>
Here, in a known dual clutch arrangement, in each case four ducts are provided on<br>
the rotary leadthrough and on the hub, with two of the ducts being assigned to the<br>
two piston spaces, and with the other two ducts being assigned to the two centrifugal<br>
force equalizing spaces.<br>
Here, the duct for the first piston space is situated axially at one end. Adjacent<br>
thereto is a duct for the first centrifugal force equalizing space. Adjacent thereto is in<br>
 <br>
3<br>
turn a duct for the second piston space, and arranged at the axially other end is a<br>
duct for the second centrifugal force equalizing space.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to specify an improved dual clutch arrange-<br>
ment.<br>
Said object is achieved in the dual clutch arrangement specified in the introduction<br>
in that the centrifugal force equalizing spaces are connected to the valve arrange-<br>
ment by means of a common line.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, the object is achieved in the dual clutch<br>
specified in the introduction in that the friction clutches are embodied as radially<br>
nested multiplate clutches and have in each case one inner plate carrier and one<br>
outer plate carrier, with the input member of the radially outer multiplate clutch<br>
being the outer plate carrier and with the input member of the radially inner clutch<br>
being the inner plate carrier.<br>
It is possible by means of the measures as per the first aspect of the invention to<br>
provide an axially more compact dual clutch arrangement overall, in particular since<br>
fewer feed lines to the piston spaces and fluid equalizing spaces are required for<br>
introducing fluid. There is also a resulting weight advantage.<br>
With the dual clutch arrangement as per the second aspect of the present invention,<br>
it is likewise possible to achieve a small installation length and a resulting weight<br>
advantage.<br>
In the dual clutch arrangement according to the present invention, it is advanta-<br>
geous if the friction clutches have in each case one input member, with the input<br>
members being mounted on a hub and with the hub being rotationally fixedly<br>
connected to a drive input shaft.<br>
 <br>
4<br>
Said measure generally permits an axially compact construction of the dual clutch<br>
arrangement.<br>
Here, it is particularly advantageous if the drive input shaft is connected to the hub<br>
by means of a cage which radially surrounds the friction clutches.<br>
It is advantageously possible by means of said measure to provide that the drive<br>
output members of the friction clutches are guided radially past the hub in the<br>
vicinity of the drive input shaft.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the hub is mounted on a spigot<br>
section, which is fixed to the housing, of a rotary leadthrough.<br>
It is hereby possible to provide that the friction clutches are supplied with fluid for<br>
their operation via the rotary leadthrough and the hub.<br>
It is particularly advantageous here if the hub has radial ducts in order to supply the<br>
friction clutches with fluid.<br>
It is also advantageous here if the hub has at least two radial actuating ducts for<br>
actuating the two friction clutches. In the present context, the term "radial duct" is<br>
to be understood in a broad sense. In the illustration of the radial ducts and of the<br>
associated rotary leadthrough, a longitudinal section view is generally assumed in<br>
which, thus, in each case only one radial duct or one projection of radial ducts can<br>
be seen. It is however self-evident that a radial duct can for example also be under-<br>
stood as a plurality of individual ducts, for example bores, which are distributed in<br>
the peripheral direction. An individual radial duct is also to be understood within the<br>
context of the present invention as when two individual ducts which are offset in the<br>
peripheral direction are connected to one single annular duct of a rotary<br>
leadthrough, but radially outwardly deviate from one another in the axial direction.<br>
 <br>
5<br>
The rotary leadthrough preferably has an annular duct which forms the common<br>
line to the two centrifugal force equalizing spaces.<br>
Here, it is particularly advantageous if the annular duct is arranged.in the axial<br>
direction between the two actuating radial ducts.<br>
It is possible by means of said measure to connect the annular duct to the two<br>
centrifugal force equalizing spaces, in particular when the latter are arranged adjacent<br>
to one another in the axial direction between the two piston spaces.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the hub has at least one first radial<br>
auxiliary duct, which is connected to the first centrifugal force equalizing space, and<br>
at least one second radial auxiliary duct which is connected to the second centrifugal<br>
force equalizing space, with the radial auxiliary ducts being connected radially at the<br>
inside to the annular duct.<br>
Here, the radial auxiliary ducts can on the one hand be composed in each case of<br>
radially outwardly branching, in each case interconnected ducts. It is however<br>
preferable for the first radial auxiliary duct and the second radial auxiliary duct to be<br>
offset relative to one another in the peripheral direction. Only one individual radial<br>
duct can be seen in a projection in the peripheral direction, so that in the present<br>
case, for simplicity, reference is at some points made to "one" radial auxiliary duct.<br>
Here, it is also particularly advantageous for an input member of one of the friction<br>
clutches to be connected to the hub in a region between the two radial auxiliary<br>
ducts.<br>
In this way, the input member of said friction clutch can be used as a separating<br>
member between the two centrifugal force equalizing spaces. The friction clutch<br>
whose input member is connected to the hub in this way is preferably a radially<br>
inner friction clutch.<br>
 <br>
6<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the annular duct serves to supply at<br>
least one of the friction clutches with cooling fluid.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the centrifugal force equalizing spaces<br>
are fluidically connected to one another.<br>
The centrifugal force equalizing spaces are generally always in an unpressurized state,<br>
that is to say are supplied with fluid which is not pressurized. If, for example, a<br>
clutch is actuated by introducing pressurized fluid into the associated piston space,<br>
fluid is forced out of the associated centrifugal force equalizing space. This is easier to<br>
provide if the two centrifugal force equalizing spaces are fluidically connected to one<br>
another. There is in particular no requirement for complicated duct arrangements in<br>
the rotary leadthrough and/or in the hub.<br>
It is however generally also conceivable, in the case of the adjacent centrifugal force<br>
equalizing spaces, for the latter to be fluidically connected to one another for exam-<br>
ple by means of openings in a separating member (such as an input member of a<br>
radially inner friction clutch).<br>
According to an embodiment which is preferable overall, the friction clutches are<br>
embodied as radially nested multiplate clutches, or multiplate clutches which are<br>
arranged one inside the other, and have in each case one inner plate carrier and one<br>
outer plate carrier.<br>
In said embodiment, it is particularly advantageous for the input member of the<br>
radially outer multiplate clutch to be its outer plate carrier and for the input member<br>
of the radially inner clutch to be its inner plate carrier.<br>
In this way, it is provided in a structurally simple manner that the dual clutch<br>
arrangement can be of an axially short overall design.<br>
 <br>
7<br>
It is self-evident that the features stated above and the features yet to be explained in<br>
the following can be used not only in the respectively specified combination but also<br>
in other combinations or individually without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the drawing and are<br>
explained in more detail in the following description. In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1 	shows a schematic longitudinal section view of a dual clutch arrange-<br>
ment (half-section view of a substantially rotationally symmetrical ar-<br>
rangement) as per one embodiment of the present invention, in con-<br>
junction with associated components of a dual clutch transmission;<br>
and<br>
Figure 2 shows a longitudinal section of a hub of the dual clutch arrangement<br>
from figure 1.<br>
In figure 1, a drivetrain for a motor vehicle is denoted generally by 10.<br>
The drivetrain 10 has a schematically indicated internal combustion engine 12 whose<br>
output is connected to a dual clutch transmission 14.<br>
The drivetrain 10 is particularly suitable for motor vehicles. The motor for driving<br>
the motor vehicle can be the internal combustion engine 12 or any other desired<br>
drive motor such as for example an electric drive, a hybrid drive or the like.<br>
The dual clutch transmission 14 contains a multistep transmission, denoted sche-<br>
matically in the figure by 16, which is designed as a layshaft transmission and<br>
contains two partial transmissions.<br>
 <br>
8<br>
In addition, the dual clutch transmission 14 has a dual clutch arrangement 20 whose<br>
input is connected to the output of the internal combustion engine 12 and which is<br>
connected at the output side to the multistep transmission 16,<br>
More precisely, the dual clutch transmission 20 has an input shaft 22 which can be<br>
rotationally fixedly connected by means of a toothing or the like to the drive output<br>
shaft of the internal combustion engine 12.<br>
The dual clutch arrangement 20 also has a first output shaft 24 in the form of a solid<br>
shaft which is connected to a first partial transmission of the multistep transmission<br>
16. In addition, the dual clutch arrangement 20 has a second output shaft 26 in the<br>
form of a hollow shaft which is connected to the second partial transmission. The<br>
shafts 24, 26 are arranged concentrically with respect to one another.<br>
The dual clutch arrangement 20 has a first friction clutch 28 which is designed to<br>
connect the input shaft 22 to the first output shaft 24, and has a second friction<br>
clutch 30 which is designed to connect the input shaft 22 to the second output shaft<br>
26.<br>
The two friction clutches 28, 30 are radially nested, with the first friction clutch 28<br>
being arranged radially at the outside and with the second friction clutch 30 being<br>
arranged, concentrically with respect thereto, radially at the inside.<br>
The two friction clutches 28, 30 are held in a cage 32 which is connected to the input<br>
shaft 22. More precisely, the cage 32 has a first cage section 34 which is connected to<br>
the input shaft 22 and extends radially outward from the latter. In addition, the cage<br>
32 has a second cage section 36 which is rotationally fixedly connected to the first<br>
cage section 34 and has a cylindrical section, in the form of an outer plate carrier 38<br>
of the first friction clutch 28, and a radially inwardly extending partial section.<br>
 <br>
9<br>
An inner plate carrier 40 of the first friction clutch 28 is connected to a first basket 42<br>
which runs directly adjacent to the first cage section 34 and is connected by means<br>
of a first toothing 44 to the first output shaft 24.<br>
The second friction clutch 30 has an outer plate carrier 46 which is connected to a<br>
second basket 48. The second basket 48 runs in the direct vicinity of the first basket<br>
42 and is connected by means of a second toothing 50 to the second output shaft 26<br>
(the hollow shaft).<br>
As is schematically indicated in the figure, axial bearings can be arranged between<br>
the first cage section 34 and the first basket 42 and between the first basket 42 and<br>
the second basket 48.<br>
In the figure, 60 denotes a clutch carrier which is mounted so as to be fixed to the<br>
housing, that is to say does not rotate. In addition, schematically illustrated at 58 is a<br>
valve arrangement or a hydraulic control arrangement, by means of which the dual<br>
clutch arrangement can be operated.<br>
Fastened to the clutch carrier 60 is a rotary leadthrough arrangement 62 which has<br>
an axially projecting hollow spigot section 64 which is arranged concentrically<br>
around the two output shafts 24, 26. The spigot section 64 extends axially from the<br>
side of the second cage section 36 towards and almost as far as the second basket 48<br>
which is connected to the second output shaft 26. Here, the spigot section 64 is<br>
situated radially within the two friction clutches 28, 30.<br>
A hub 66 is rotatably mounted on the spigot section 64 of the rotary leadthrough<br>
arrangement 62. The figure shows two bearings, by means of which the hub 66 is<br>
rotatably mounted on the spigot section 64 of the rotary leadthrough arrangement<br>
62.<br>
 <br>
10<br>
The second cage section 36 is rigidly connected to the hub 66, so that the hub 66<br>
forms an input member of the dual clutch arrangement 20 and rotates at the rota-<br>
tional speed of the attached motor 12.<br>
An inner plate carrier 68 of the second friction clutch 30 is fixed to the hub 66.<br>
Between the inner plate carrier 68 and the second cage section 36, a first piston 70 of<br>
the first friction clutch 28 is mounted so as to be axially displaceable relative to the<br>
hub 66. The piston 70 is of disk-like design and extends from the hub 66 radially<br>
outward as far as the first friction clutch 28.<br>
A first piston space 72 is formed between the second cage section 36 and the first<br>
piston 70. The first piston space 72 is connected by means of the rotary leadthrough<br>
arrangement 62 and the clutch carrier 60 to the valve arrangement 58. By supplying<br>
fluid (generally hydraulic fluid such as for example ATF oil) into the first piston space<br>
72 (via the first radial actuating duct 74, see below), the first piston 70 is displaced<br>
axially relative to the second cage section 36 and presses the plates of the first fric-<br>
tion clutch 28 together, so that said plates come into frictional engagement in order<br>
to thereby close the first friction clutch 28 and to connect the input shaft 22 to the<br>
first output shaft 24.<br>
The transition from the open state into the closed state of the first friction clutch 28<br>
can take place in a controlled fashion in such a way that a suitable slip phase occurs<br>
in order to thereby permit jerk-free starting and gearshifts, respectively.<br>
For the purpose of supplying hydraulic fluid into the first piston space 72, a first<br>
radial actuating duct 74 (formed for example by means of a plurality of bores which<br>
are offset in the peripheral direction) is provided in the hub 66, which first radial<br>
actuating duct 74 connects the first piston space 72 to a corresponding first annular<br>
duct (not denoted in any more detail in the figure) of the spigot section 64, with the<br>
 <br>
11<br>
first annular duct in turn being connected, by means of suitable ducts in the rotary<br>
leadthrough arrangement 62, to the clutch carrier 60 or to the valve arrangement 58.<br>
Also formed on the inner plate carrier 68 is a web (not denoted in any more detail),<br>
against which are supported a plurality of first return springs 76 which are arranged<br>
so as to be distributed uniformly about the periphery. The actuation of the first<br>
piston 70 accordingly takes place counter to the force of the first return springs 76.<br>
A first centrifugal force equalizing space 78 is provided between the piston 70 and<br>
the inner plate carrier 68 of the second friction clutch 30.<br>
The centrifugal force equalizing space 78 has the function of generating a counter-<br>
force to a clutch actuating force which is generated by the centrifugal force and is<br>
generated in the associated first piston space 72.<br>
At high rotational speeds in particular, the hydraulic fluid which is present in the<br>
first piston space 72 is pushed outward in such a way that ultimately a force is<br>
exerted on the piston in the direction of actuation of the first friction clutch 28. Said<br>
force, in the manner of an interference force, consequently counteracts a return force<br>
which is exerted by the return springs 76 as the first friction clutch 28 opens. In<br>
order to equalize said "interference force", hydraulic fluid is allowed to flow, unpres-<br>
surized, into the opposite centrifugal force equalizing space 78. There, as a result of<br>
the centrifugal force, a counter-force in the opening direction of the first friction<br>
clutch 28 is generated which counteracts said "interference force" and cancels out<br>
the latter.<br>
For this purpose, the first centrifugal force equalizing space 78 is connected by means<br>
of a first radial auxiliary duct 80 to a second annular duct 82 on the spigot section<br>
64, with the second annular duct 82 in turn being connected by means of corre-<br>
sponding ducts or lines in the rotary leadthrough arrangement 62 to the valve<br>
arrangement 58.<br>
 <br>
12<br>
A second centrifugal force equalizing space 86 is set up at the other side of the inner<br>
plate carrier 68. Said centrifugal force equalizing space 86 is connected by means of a<br>
second radial auxiliary duct 84 to the second annular duct 82 of the spigot section<br>
64.<br>
The two centrifugal force equalizing spaces 78, 86 are consequently adjacent to one<br>
another and separated from one another merely by the inner plate carrier 68 of the<br>
second friction clutch 30.<br>
The second centrifugal force equalizing space 86 is delimited at the axially other side<br>
by a second piston 90 which is likewise mounted so as to be displaceable in the axial<br>
direction relative to the hub 66.<br>
A support member 89 is fastened to the hub 66. Said support member 89 extends<br>
outward in the radial direction axially between the second piston 90 and the second<br>
basket 48. A second piston space 92 is set up between the support member 89 and<br>
the second piston 90. The second piston space 92 is connected by means of a second<br>
radial actuating duct 94 to a third annular duct on the spigot section 64. The second<br>
piston space 92 is connected to the valve arrangement 58 by means of said third<br>
annular duct.<br>
Furthermore, second return springs 96 are arranged in the second centrifugal force<br>
equalizing space 86, which second return springs 96 are supported against a bearing<br>
element 88. The bearing element 88 is in turn supported against a free end of the<br>
inner plate carrier 68 or is fixed thereto. The bearing element 88 also serves to delimit<br>
the second centrifugal force equalizing space 86 by means of a seal between the<br>
bearing element 88 and the second piston 90.<br>
The functioning of the second friction clutch 30 corresponds to that of the first<br>
friction clutch 28, merely with the actuating direction being aligned in the opposite<br>
direction. While the first piston 70 is arranged at the one side of the two friction<br>
 <br>
13<br>
clutches 28, 30, the second piston 90 is arranged at the opposite side. The second<br>
piston 90 is likewise embodied as a disk-like element, which is mounted on the hub<br>
66 in an axially central region of the second friction clutch 30. The second piston 90<br>
extends radially outward around the second friction clutch 30 from said axially<br>
central region. The second centrifugal force equalizing space 86 is hereby arranged<br>
substantially radially within the second friction clutch 30. The second return springs<br>
96 are also arranged radially within the second friction clutch 30.<br>
As a result of said measure, the dual clutch arrangement 20 can be designed overall to<br>
be particularly compact in the axial direction.<br>
This is also facilitated in that the two centrifugal force equalizing spaces 78, 86 are<br>
arranged adjacent to one another and can be connected to the valve arrangement 58<br>
by means of the second annular duct 82 on the spigot section 64 of the rotary<br>
leadthrough arrangement 62, that is to say can ultimately be supplied with unpres-<br>
surized hydraulic fluid via one single duct (a common line).<br>
It is also possible for the friction clutches 28, 30 to be supplied with cooling fluid via<br>
the second annular duct 82 or via the radial auxiliary ducts which are arranged so as<br>
to be offset in the peripheral direction. Said cooling fluid passes out, for example<br>
through bores in the plate carriers, radially outward as a result of the centrifugal<br>
forces, and cools the two friction clutches 28, 30. The fluid returns from there (gen-<br>
erally via a cooler).<br>
The return springs 76, 96 are illustrated in the figure as coil springs. Plate springs<br>
could however also be used instead.<br>
It is particularly significant that only three peripheral grooves (annular ducts) which<br>
are offset in the axial direction are required on the spigot section 64 of the rotary<br>
leadthrough arrangement 62 for feeding hydraulic fluid to the dual clutch arrange-<br>
ment 20. This also results in a short axial installation length and a weight advantage.<br>
 <br>
14<br>
In order to actuate the friction clutches 28, 30, hydraulic fluid at a pressure in the<br>
region of for example 15 bar is introduced in each case into the respective piston<br>
spaces 72 and 92.<br>
Although, in the figure, the hub 66 is illustrated with in each case one first radial<br>
actuating duct 74, one third radial actuating duct 94 and with two radial auxiliary<br>
ducts 80, 84, it is self-evident that corresponding ducts or bores can be arranged so as<br>
to be distributed about the periphery of the hub 66.<br>
The hub 66 is illustrated in a longitudinal section view in figure 2. It can be seen here<br>
that the "radial ducts" 74, 80, 84, 94 can in each case be composed of a plurality of<br>
peripherally distributed bores. Here, the bores of the ducts 80, 84 are provided so as<br>
to alternate in the peripheral direction. The ducts 80, 84 open out radially at the<br>
inside into a common line 102.<br>
The bores of the duct 80 run radially vertically; the bores of the duct 84 run radially<br>
outward at an angle.<br>
Bores of the ducts 84, 94 of the clutch 30 open out at the outside in each case on one<br>
axial line 101. The bores of the ducts 80, 74 correspondingly open out in each case<br>
on an axial line 103 which is offset in the peripheral direction.<br>
