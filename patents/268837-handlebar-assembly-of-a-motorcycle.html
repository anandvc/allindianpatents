TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The subject matter described herein in general relates to handlebar assembly of a motorcycle and in particular relates to a rear cover for the handlebar assembly of a motorcycle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Conventionally, a motorcycle handlebar assembly includes a front cover and a rear cover adapted to constitute a handle cover. Headlamp and other signaling devices of the motorcycle are housed in the front cover. Other parts such as control switches, electric start, indicators etc are housed in the rear cover. The handlebar assembly comprising the front cover and the rear cover is mounted on the handlebar of the motorcycle. In such a design, front cover is rigidly fixed to the handlebar of the motorcycle. A relief is provided on the rear cover to locate the master cylinder.<br>
The master cylinder is filled with oil. The predetermined level of oil should be maintained inside the master cylinder so as to achieve optimum performance of the braking system of the motorcycle. In order to examine the level of oil present inside the master cylinder, a portion of the master cylinder is kept protruding out of the rear cover. In such type of layout, wherein the master cylinder is kept protruding, the movement of the handlebar is hindered due to the unusual protrusion. Moreover this protrusion results in a recess, which allows the entry for unwanted dust particles and water to ingress inside the opening. Entry of dust particle and water leads to corrosion and rusting of the parts housed beneath the rear cover of the motorcycle.<br>
In other existing layouts, the master cylinder is enclosed by the front cover. In such type of layouts, a view hole is provided on top of the front cover and a person needs to lean forward in order to observe the level of oil present inside the master cylinder. Further, the view hole is typically kept open. Since the view hole is kept open, it allows the unwanted dust particles and water to penetrate through the view hole, thereby leading to corrosion and rusting of the parts present beneath the rear cover of the motorcycle. Also, the positioning of master cylinder in front cover makes it inconvenient for a rider of the two-wheeler to view the level of oil present inside the master cylinder. Therefore, a challenge is to enhance the ease of view-ability of oil level inside the master cylinder. Another challenge is to prevent the ingress of water and other external particles, such as dust particles, into the opening or recess, thereby preventing rusting and corrosion of the parts underneath.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The subject matter described herein is directed to the a rear cover of a handlebar assembly for a motorcycle that enhances the view-ability of the oil level inside the master cylinder in addition to preventing the rusting and the corrosion of the parts present underneath the rear cover by stopping the ingress of water and other environmental particles, such as dust, inside the opening or recess formed.<br>
According to one aspect of the present subject matter, the handlebar assembly includes a handlebar and a steering system, the steering system being secured to the handlebar by means of an upper bracket. The other end of the upper bracket is attached to the rear cover. The rear cover includes a first opening, one or more switch recesses, and one or more second opening wherein the first opening is disposed at the centre of the rear cover in order to accommodate a meter. One or more switch receivers are disposed crosswise at one or more peripheral ends of the rear cover. In order to view the level of oil present inside the master cylinder, one or more second openings are formed in between the first opening and the switch recesses in such a way that master cylinder is positioned directly behind the second opening and is clearly visible.<br>
In another aspect of the present subject matter, the first opening and the second openings are covered with a transparent sheet, which eliminates the infiltration of water and environmental particles inside the opening, thereby preventing the rusting and the corrosion of the parts disposed beneath the first and the second openings.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present subject matter will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>

Fig.l.<br>
Fig.3 shows a perspective view of a rear cover of the handlebar of Fig.2.<br>
Fig.4 shows a sectional perspective view of the rear cover of Fig.3. DESCRIPTION<br>
In order to address the aforesaid challenges, a rear cover for the handlebar assembly which enhances the view-ability of the oil level inside the master cylinder is designed. Further, the rear cover also prevents infiltration of water and other environmental particles inside the opening or recess, thereby preventing the rusting and wear of parts consequently resulting in increased life span of parts disposed underneath the rear cover.<br>
According to one embodiment of the subject matter described herein, an opening of a predetermined shape is formed on the rear cover. The opening is covered with a transparent sheet in such a way that it allows easy and convenient viewing of oil level present inside the master cylinder. Thus by employing the aforesaid methodology, irregular protrusion of the master cylinder is evaded. Secondly, penetration of the water and the unwanted environmental particles inside the handlebar assembly is eliminated.<br>
Fig.l illustrates a perspective view of a motorcycle in accordance with one embodiment of the present subject matter. The embodiments disclosed herein are described in the context of a motorcycle. However, the embodiments and the subject matter herein can also be applied to other vehicles, such as scooter type two or three- wheeled vehicles, all terrain vehicles, and other vehicles with more than two wheels.<br>
As used herein, the terms "front", "rear", "left", "right", "up", and "down", correspond to the direction assumed by a driver of the vehicle. The motorcycle is configured for accommodating two persons, a rider and a pillion. The motorcycle includes a seat, a front wheel, a rear wheel, and a handlebar assembly 100(shown in Fig.2). At the front end of the motorcycle, a handlebar assembly 100 is provided, which includes a front cover 150 and a rear cover 120 to constitute a handle cover.<br>
The two wheeled motorcycle further includes a wheel braking apparatus which comprises a front brake and a rear brake for a front wheel and a rear wheel, and a master cylinder 145 (shown in Fig.4) disposed on the handlebar 105 (shown in Fig.2). A master cylinder 145 assembly actuates the brake system or the clutch system or both. Master cylinder 145 is filled with oil or brake fluid and is disposed on right hand side of the handlebar 105 of the motorcycle. The oil or brake fluid present inside the master cylinder 145 is delivered to the brakes of the motorcycle through a circuit. In another embodiment master cylinder 145 is disposed on left hand side of the handlebar 105. In yet another embodiment, master cylinder 145 is disposed either on left hand side or right hand side or both sides of the handlebar 105 of the motorcycle.<br>
Fig.2 shows the perspective view of a handlebar assembly 100 of the motorcycle of Fig.l. The handlebar assembly 100 comprises a handlebar 105, a steering system 110 secured rigidly to the handlebar 105 by means of an upper bracket 115. The handlebar 105 is attached to a first end of upper bracket 115 by means of fasteners such as handlebar holders and bolts. The second end of upper bracket 115 is attached to steering system 110 by means of fasteners such as nuts and bolts. Master cylinder 145 (shown in <br>
