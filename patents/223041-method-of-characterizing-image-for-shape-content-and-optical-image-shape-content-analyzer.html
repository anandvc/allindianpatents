				<td>METHOD OF CHARACTERIZING IMAGE FOR SHAPE CONTENT AND<br>
OPTICAL IMAGE SHAPE CONTENT ANALYZER<br>
Related Patent Application<br>
This patent application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application serial<br>
no. 09/536,426, filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on March 27, 2000<br>
(corresponding Indian Patent No. 199001).<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to spatial light modulators and, more particularly, to<br>
a spatial light modulator with radially oriented active light modulating sectors for radial and<br>
angular analysis of beams of light, including Fourier transform optic patterns, for uses such<br>
as characterizing, searching, matching or identifying shape content of images. Background<br>
Art<br>
There are situations in which useful information can be derived from spatially<br>
dispersed portions of light beams. In particular, when an image is being carried or<br>
propagated by a light beam, it may be useful to gather and use or analyze information from<br>
a particular portion of the image, such as from a particular portion of a cross-section of a<br>
beam that is carrying an image.<br>
For example, in my co-pending U.S. Patent Application, serial no. 09/536,426,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference, narrow, radially oriented portions of a Fourier<br>
transform of an image are captured, detected, and used to characterize and encode images<br>
by shape for storage, searching, and retrieval. As explained therein, such radially oriented,<br>
angularly or rationally spaced portions of a Fourier transform of an image are captured<br>
sequentially by positioning a rotating, opaque mask or wheel with a radially oriented slit in<br>
the Fourier transform plane of a light beam carrying the image after passing the light beam<br>
through a Fourier transform lens and detecting the light that passes through the slit at<br>
various angular orientations, i.e., degrees of rotation. The light energy detected at each<br>
angular orientation is characteristic of the portions of the image content that are generally<br>
linearly aligned in the same angular orientation as the slit in the rotating mask when the<br>
light energy is detected.<br>
That system with the rotating, radially oriented, slit does perform the task of<br>
characterizing and encoding images by shape content of the images quite well and quite<br>
efficiently. However, it still has several shortcomings. For example, resolution of spatial<br>
frequency of an image at each angular orientation of the rotating slit is not as good as some<br>
applications or uses of such a system might require. Also, the spinning mask or wheel with<br>
an associated drive mechanism, like all mechanical devices, has stability and long term<br>
reliability issues, not to mention size and weight requirements.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is a general object of this invention to provide an improved<br>
apparatus and method for capturing and recording optical information from portions of<br>
optical images.<br>
A more specific object of this invention is to provide an improved apparatus and<br>
method for spatial analysis of Fourier transform optical patterns of images for shape content<br>
of such images.<br>
Another specific object of this invention is to provide an improved apparatus and<br>
method for characterizing and encoding images by shape content for storing, searching,<br>
comparing, matching, or identifying images.<br>
This and other objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention shall be set<br>
forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art upon examination of the following description or may be learned by the practice<br>
of the invention. The objects and the advantages may be realized and attained by means of<br>
the instrumentalities and in combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
To further achieve the foregoing objects, the apparatus of this invention includes a<br>
spatial light modulator with a plurality of addressable, active optic elements that extend<br>
radially at various angular orientations in relation to an axis. The active optic elements are<br>
preferably shaped to modulate portions of light beams incident on discrete sectors of an<br>
active optic area on which the beam of light can be focused. Therefore, active optic<br>
modulators in the shape of individual sectors, i.e., essentially wedge-shaped, are preferred,<br>
although other shapes are also feasible and, in special circumstances, possibly even more<br>
desirable, such as rectangular for better resolution or curved for detection of curved shape<br>
content of an image. For better resolution of spatial frequency of shape content, the radially<br>
extending wedges or rectangles of the active optic area can be comprised of individually<br>
addressable segments, which can be activated separately or in groups, depending on the<br>
resolution desires. Wedge-shaped sectors can comprise segments of smaller, truncated<br>
wedge-shaped active optic elements or groups of sensors in pixel arrays that, in composite,<br>
form such shapes. Rectangular areas can also comprise smaller rectangular segments or<br>
composited groups of sensors in pixel arrays to form such radially extending, angularly<br>
spaced, active optic components or areas. For shape content characterization of an image,<br>
an optic pattern that is a Fourier transform of the image is focused on the active optic area,<br>
and radially disposed portions of the Fourier transform optic pattern at various angular<br>
orientations are selected and isolated by the spatial light modulator for detection of shape<br>
content of the image that is aligned with such angular orientations. The intensities of light<br>
detected from such respective portions are characteristic of such shape content and can be<br>
recorded, stored, or used to compare with similarly analyzed shape content of other images<br>
to find and identify matches or near matches of images with such shape content. Optional<br>
image pre-processing to add ghost images at various radial and angular relationships to the<br>
image and at various light intensities can enhance detectability of shape content and can<br>
enable near matching of images with similar shape content.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A segmented radial spatial light modulator (SLM) device SO according to the present<br>
invention is illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1 with a beam of light 27(p) focused on<br>
the active optic area 54 in the center portion of the segmented radial SLM device 50. As<br>
illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1, the segmented radial SLM device 50 is preferably,<br>
but not necessarily, constructed as an integrated circuit 52 mounted on a chip 56 equipped<br>
with a plurality of electrical pins 58 configured to be plugged into a correspondingly<br>
configured receptacle (not shown) on a printed circuit board (not shown). In such a<br>
preferred embodiment, the pins 58 are connected electrically by a plurality of wires 59<br>
soldered to contact pads 55 of the integrated circuit 52 to enable addressing and operating<br>
optic components in the active optic area 54, as will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
An enlarged elevation view of the active optic area 54 of the integrated circuit 52 is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2, and an even more enlarged view of the active optic segments 502,<br>
504, 506, 508 of one modulator sector 500 (sometimes hereinafter "sector" for convenience)<br>
of the active optic area 54 is illustrated in Figure 3. Essentially, the segmented radial SLM<br>
device 50 is capable of selectively isolating radially disposed portions of the incident light<br>
energy at various angular orientations in relation to a central axis 40 for detection, as will be<br>
explained in more detail below. One way of accomplishing such isolation is by reflecting,<br>
as well as rotating plane of polarization of, the selected radially disposed portions of the<br>
light beam 27(p) that is incident on the active optic area 54, while other portions of the light<br>
beam 27(p) are reflected, but without rotation of the plane of polarization, or vice versa. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, each of the active optic segments, such as segments 502, 504,<br>
506, 508 of sector 500 in Figure 3, are addressable individually through electrically<br>
conductive traces 503, 505, 507, 509, respectively, although the invention also can be<br>
implemented, albeit with less spatial frequency resolution, by a sector 500 comprising only<br>
one active optic modulator or by activating one or more of the individual segments<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The selection and isolation of a portion of the incident light beam 27(p) is illustrated<br>
in Figure 4, which is a partial cross-section of active optic segments 506, 508. An incident<br>
light beam 27(p), which is designated, for examples as being p-polarized, i.e., polarized in<br>
the p-plane, will be reflected by, and will emerge from, segment 508 as s-polarized light<br>
27(s), i.e., light polarized in the s-plane, or vice versa, when the segment 508 is activated by<br>
a voltage V+ on trace 509, while the unactivated segment 506 reflects, but does not rotate<br>
plane of polarization of, the incident light 27(p). In Figure 4, the light reflected by the<br>
activated segment 508 is designated as 61 (s) to indicate its s-plane polarization, while light<br>
reflected by the non-activated segment 506 is designated as 61(p) to indicate its p-plane<br>
polarization. The structure and function of the segments 506, 508, which are typical of all<br>
the segments of all the sectors 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610,<br>
620, 630, 640, 650 of the active optic area 54, will be explained in more detail below.<br>
Suffice it to say at this point that a s-polarization plane is orthogonal to i.e., rotated 90° in<br>
relation to, a p-polarization plane and that such rotation of plane of polarization of a portion<br>
of a light beam 61 (p) (see Figure 1) enables filtration or separation of that portion from the<br>
remainder of the light beam 61 (p), as will be explained in more detail below.<br>
The system 10 for characterizing, encoding, and storing images by shape content of<br>
such images, as illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 5, is an example application of the<br>
segmented radial SLM device 50 described above and is a part of this invention. In this<br>
system 10, any number n of images 12, 14,..., n, can be characterized and encoded by the<br>
shape content in such images, and such encoded shape information about each image can be<br>
stored, for example, in database 102 for subsequent searching, retrieval, and comparison to<br>
shape content of other images that is characterized and encoded in the same manner.<br>
The images 12, 14,..., n can be in virtually any form, for example, visual images<br>
on photographs, films, drawings, graphics, arbitrary patterns, ordered patterns, or the like.<br>
They can also be stored and/or generated in or from digital formats or analog formats. Such<br>
images can have content that is meaningful in some manner when viewed by humans, or<br>
they can be meaningless or not capable of being interrupted by humans but characteristic of<br>
some other content, e.g., music, sounds, text, software, and the like. Essentially, any optic<br>
pattern of light energy intensities that can be manifested or displayed with discernable shape<br>
content can be characterized and encoded with this system 10.<br>
A sample image 12, which can be obtained from any source (e.g., Internet,<br>
electronic data base, web site, library, scanner, photograph, film strip, radar image,<br>
electronic still or moving video camera, and other sources) is entered into the optical image<br>
shape characterizer 10, as will be described in more detail below. Any number n of other<br>
sample images 14,..., n, are shown in Figure 5 queued for entry in sequence into the<br>
optical image characterizer 10. Entry of any number n of such sequential images 12, 14,...<br>
, n can be done manually or, preferably, in an automated manner, such as a mechanical slide<br>
handler, a computer image generator, a film strip projector, an electronic still or video<br>
camera, or the like. The computer 20 in Figure 5 is a preferred embodiment, but is also<br>
intended to be symbolic of any apparatus or system that is capable of queuing and moving<br>
images 12, 14,..., n into the image characterizer 10. The example image 12 of an<br>
automobile displayed on the video monitor 22 represents and is symbolic of any image that<br>
is placed in a process mode for characterizing and encoding its shape content according to<br>
this invention, although it should be understood that such display of the image being<br>
processed is not an essential feature of this invention. The description that follows will, for<br>
the most part, refer only to the first image 12 for convenience and simplicity, but with the<br>
understanding that it could apply as well to any image 12,14,..., n etc.<br>
In the embodiment of the system 10 illustrated in Figure 5, the image 12 is inserted<br>
into the optical image characterizer 10 in an image plane 19 that is perpendicular to the<br>
beam of light 27 emanating from the E-SLM 26, i.e., perpendicular to the plane of the view<br>
in Figure 5. However, to facilitate explanation, illustration, and understanding of the<br>
invention, the images 12, 14,..., n are also shown in phantom lines in the plane of the<br>
view in Figure 5, i.e., in the plane of the paper. This same convention is also used to project<br>
image 12' produced by the E-SLM 26, the Fourier transform optic pattern 32, the active<br>
optic area 54, isolated and filtered optic pattern 60, and the detector grid 82 from their<br>
respective planes perpendicular to the light beams into the plane of the paper for purposes of<br>
explanation, illustration, and understanding. These components and their functions in the<br>
invention will be explained in more detail below.<br>
As mentioned above, the image 12 can be entered into the optical image<br>
characterizer 10 by the computer 20 and E-SLM 26, as will be described in more detail<br>
below. However, the image 12 will undergo a significant transformation upon passing<br>
through the thin, positive lens 30, also called the Fourier transform (FT) lens. A Fourier<br>
transform (FT) of the sample image 12' rearranges the light energy of the optic pattern of<br>
image 12' into a Fourier transform (FT) optic pattern 32, which is unique to the image 12',<br>
even though it is not recognizable as the image 12' to the human eye and brain, and which<br>
can be characterized by intensities, i.e., amplitudes, of light energy distributed spatially<br>
across the optic pattern 32. The complex amplitude distribution of light energy 34 in the<br>
optic pattern 32 is the Fourier transform of the complex light distribution in the image 12'.<br>
Image 12' is a recreation of the image 12 in monochromatic, preferably coherent, light<br>
energy, as will be described in more detail below, although white light will also work.<br>
Concentrations of intense light energy in the Fourier transform (FT) optic pattern 32<br>
generally correspond to spatial frequencies of the image 12', i.e., how closely together or far<br>
apart features in the image 12' change or remain the same. In other words, spatial<br>
frequencies are also manifested by how closely together or far apart light energy intensities<br>
across the light beam 27 change or remain the same. For example, a shirt with a plaid fabric<br>
in an image (not shown), i.e., having many small squares, would have a higher spatial<br>
frequency, i.e., changes per unit of distance, than a plain, single-color shirt (not shown) in<br>
the image. Likewise, portions of an image, such as the bumper and grill parts 35 of the<br>
automobile in image 12', would have a higher spatial frequency than the side panel 36<br>
portion of the automobile image 12', because the bumper and grill parts 35 comprise many<br>
small pieces with various edges, curves, and other intricate changes within a small spatial<br>
distance, whereas the side panel 36 is fairly smooth and uniform over a large spatial<br>
distance. Light energy from the finer and sharper details of an image (more spatial<br>
frequency), such as the more intricate bumper and grill parts 35 of the image 12', tend to be<br>
dispersed farther radially outward from the optical center or axis 40 in the Fourier<br>
transformed image than light energy from more course or plain details of an image (less<br>
spatial frequency), such as the side panel 36 of the image 12'. The amplitude of light energy<br>
34 dispersed radially outward in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 is related to the light<br>
energy of the corresponding portions of the optic pattern of image 12' from which such light<br>
energy emanates, except that such light energy is concentrated into areas or bands 34 at the<br>
plane of the Fourier transform (FT) optic pattern 32 after they are refracted by the FT lens<br>
30, i.e., into bands of intense light energy separated by bands of little or no light energy,<br>
which result from constructive and destructive interference of the diffracted light energy. If<br>
the high spatial frequency portions of the image 12', such as the bumper and grill portion 35,<br>
are bright, then the intensity or amplitude of light energy from those high spatial frequency<br>
portions of the image 12', which are dispersed by the FT lens 30 to the more radially<br>
outward bands of light energy 34 in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32, will be higher,<br>
i.e., brighter. On the other hand, if the high spatial frequency portions of the optic pattern of<br>
image 12' are dim, then the intensity or amplitude of light energy from those high spatial<br>
frequency portions of the optic pattern of image 12', which are dispersed by the FT lens 30<br>
to the more radially outward bands of light energy 34 in the Fourier transform optic pattern<br>
32, will be lower, i.e., not so bright. Likewise, if the low spatial frequency portions of the<br>
optic pattern of image 12', such as the side panel portion 36, arc bright, then the intensity or<br>
amplitude of light energy from those low spatial frequency portions of the optic pattern of<br>
image 12' which are dispersed by the FT lens to the less radially outward bands of light<br>
energy 34 in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 (i.e., closer to the optical axis 40), will<br>
be higher, i.e., brighter. However, if the low spatial frequency portions of the optic pattern<br>
of image 12' are dim, then the intensity or amplitude of light energy from those low spatial<br>
frequency portions of the optic pattern of image 12", which are dispersed by the FT lens 30<br>
to the less radially outward bands of light energy 34 in the Fourier transform optic pattern<br>
32, will be lower, i.e., not so bright.<br>
In summary, the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 of the light emanating from the<br>
image 12': (i) is unique to the image 12'; (ii) comprises areas or bands of light energy 34<br>
concentration, which are dispersed radially from the center or optical axis 40, that represent<br>
spatial frequencies, i.e., fineness of details, in the image 12'; (iii) the intensity or amplitudes<br>
of light energy 34 at each spatial frequency area or band in the Fourier transform optic<br>
pattern 32 corresponds to brightness or intensity of light energy emanating from the<br>
respective fine or course features of the image 12'; and (iv) such light energy 34 in the areas<br>
or bands of the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 are detectable in intensity and in spatial<br>
location by this invention.<br>
Since this optical image characterizer 10 of this invention is designed to characterize<br>
an image 12 by shapes that comprise the image 12, additional spatial filtering of the Fourier<br>
transform light energy pattern 32 is used to detect and capture light energy emanating from<br>
the finer or sharper details or parts of such finer or sharper details in the image 12', which<br>
are aligned linearly in various specific angular orientations. Such spatial filtering can be<br>
accomplished in any of a number of different ways, as will be explained in more detail<br>
below, but an exemplary spatial filter arrangement for this function is included in a<br>
combination of the segmented radial spatial light modulator device 50 with the polarizing<br>
beam splitter 70. Essentially, the segmented radial SLM device 50 rotates the plane of<br>
polarization of selected portions of the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 from p-plane<br>
polarization to s-plane polarization, or vice versa, as explained above, and the polarizing<br>
beam splitter 70 separates light energy of those portions that is isolated and polarized in one<br>
plane from the light energy of the rest of the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 that remains<br>
polarized in the other plane so that such light energy of the selected and isolated portions<br>
can be detected separately.<br>
Only the portions of the light energy 34 in the Fourier TRANSFORM pattern 32 that<br>
align linearly with selected active optic segments, for example, segment 502, 504, 506,<br>
and/or 508 (Figure 3), have the plane of polarization rotated in the reflected light 61 (s) by<br>
the segmented radial SLM 50. Such selected portions 61(s) of the beam 27(p) represent,<br>
i.e., emanated largely from, details or features of the image 12', such as straight lines and<br>
short segments of curved lines, that align linearly with the angular orientation of the<br>
respective sectors 500, 510,520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590,600, 610, 620, 630,<br>
640,650 in which selected segments are located in the active optic area 54 of the segmented<br>
radial SLM 50. For example, if one or more of the segments 502, 504, 506,508 in sector<br>
500 is selected and activated to rotate plane of polarization of light energy reflected from<br>
such segments(s), the reflected light energy 61 (s) will have emanated largely from details or<br>
features of the image 12' that align linearly with the vertical orientation of the sector 500 in<br>
which segments 502, 504, 506, 508 are positioned. Further, since the light energy 34 from<br>
higher spatial frequency content of the image 12', e.g., closely spaced bumper and grill parts<br>
35, are dispersed farther radially outward in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 than light<br>
energy 34 from lower spatial frequency content, e.g., side panel 36, the light energy in<br>
reflected light beam 61 (s) will also be characteristic of a confined range of such spatial<br>
frequency content of image 12', depending on which segment of a sector is selected. For<br>
example, activation of outer segment 508 of sector 500 (Figure 3), which is positioned<br>
farther radially outward from the optic axis 40 of the incident beam 27(p) than segment 502,<br>
will cause the light energy in reflected beam 61(s) to be characteristic of higher spatial<br>
frequency content of vertically oriented features in image 12', e.g., vertical edges of bumper<br>
and grill parts 35. In contrast, activation of inner segment 502 of sector 500, will cause the<br>
light energy in reflected beam 61(s) to be more characteristic lower spatial frequency<br>
content of vertically oriented features in the image 12', e.g., the vertical rear edge of the<br>
trunk lid 37. The result is a filtered pattern 60 of light energy bands 62 that represent or are<br>
characteristic of the unique combination of features or lines in the content of image 12' that<br>
corresponds to light energy of the FT optic pattern 32 at the radial distance of the selected<br>
segment and that align linearly with the sector in which the selected segment is positioned.<br>
Therefore, in addition to being able to provide rotational spatial filtering of the FT optic<br>
pattern 32 at different angular orientations about the optic axis, the segments of each sector,<br>
such as segments 502, 504, 506, 508 of sector 500, provided the additional capability of<br>
scalar spatial filtering FT optic pattern 32 at different radial distances from the optic axis.<br>
Of course, segments in different sectors of different angular orientations about the<br>
optic axis 40 will align linearly with features or lines in the image 12' that have different<br>
angular orientations, as will be described in more detail below. Thus, the light energy bands<br>
62 in the filtered pattern 60 will change, as active optic segments in different sectors are<br>
selected and activated, to represent different features, details, edges, or lines in the optical<br>
pattern of image 12' at various angular orientations, intricateness or fineness, and<br>
brightness, as will be explained in more detail below. In general, however, the light energy<br>
bands 62, if inverse Fourier transformed from the FT optic pattern 32 after the above-<br>
described spatial filtering 54, will be located in the same spatially-related sites as the<br>
features in the original image 12' from which such light energy emanated. For example,<br>
light energy in a band 62 in pattern 60 that originally emanated from bumper and grill parts<br>
35 in image 12', after spatial filtering with the vertical sector of the spatial filter SLM 5<br>
and inverse transmission, as explained above, will correspond to the vertical bumper an<br>
grill parts 35 in image 12'.<br>
The spatially filtered light energy in bands 62 of the filtered pattern 60 can be<br>
detected by a photodetector 80 at any of the various angular orientations of the activated<br>
sectors and fed electronically to a computer 20 or other microprocessor or computer for<br>
processing and encoding. While only one photodetector 80 with an example 16x16 array 82<br>
of individual photosensitive energy transducers 84 is illustrated in Figure 5 and is sufficient<br>
for many purposes of this invention, other detector arrangements, for example, the two<br>
offset detector arrays described in co-pending patent application, serial no. 09/536,426, or<br>
one or more larger detector arrays, could also be used.<br>
The computer 20, with input of information about the filtered optical patterns 60,<br>
i.e., light energy intensity (I) distribution, from the detector array 82, along with information<br>
about the image 12 (e.g., identification number, source locator, and the like), information<br>
about the angular orientation (R) of the sector in which a segment is activated, and<br>
information about the radial distance or scale (S) of the activated segment relating to spatial<br>
frequency, can be programmed to encode the characteristics of the image 12 relating to the<br>
shape content of the image 12. One useful format for encoding such information is by pixel<br>
of the filtered image 60, including information regarding x, y coordinate location of each<br>
pixel, Rotation (i.e., angular orientation of the sector in which a segment is activated, thus<br>
of the linear features of the image 12 that align with such angular orientation), and Intensity<br>
(i.e., amplitude of light energy from the filtered pattern 60 that is detected at each pixel at<br>
the angular orientation R. A searchable flag, such as a distortion factor X, can also be<br>
provided, as explained in more detail co-pending patent application, serial no. 09/536,426 or<br>
by the ghost image pre-processing feature of this invention, which will be explained in more<br>
detail below. Such combination of angular orientation or rotation R, light energy intensity I<br>
for each pixel, and distortion factor X can be called a "RIXcl" for short. Scale (i.e., spatial<br>
frequencies of image 12 content at such angular orientations) can also be included in such<br>
encoding, if desired. When including a scale factor S, the combination can be called a<br>
"RIXScl". Each RlXel or RJXSel can then be associated with some identifier for the image<br>
12 from which it was derived (e.g., a number, name, or the like), the source location of the<br>
image 12 (e.g., Internet URL, data base file, book title, owner of the image 12, and the like),<br>
and any other desired information about the image, such as format, resolution, color,<br>
texture, content description, search category, or the like. Some of such other information,<br>
such as color, texture, content description, and/or search category, can be information input<br>
from another data base, from human input, or even from another optical characterizer that<br>
automatically characterizes the same image 12 as to color, texture, or the like—whatever<br>
would be useful for searching, finding, or retrieving image 12 or for comparing image 12 to<br>
other images.<br>
Some, all, or additional combinations of such information about each image 12, 14 .<br>
.., n characterized for shape and encoded, as described above, can be sent by the computer<br>
20 to one or more data base(s) 102. Several example data base architectures 104, 106, 108<br>
for storing RIXel or RlXSel information about each image 12, 14.....n are shown in<br>
Figure 5, but many other architectures and combinations of information could also be used.<br>
In the optical image characterizer 10 illustrated in Figure 5, the image 12 has to be<br>
recreated with monochromatic, preferably coherent, light energy, e.g., at image 12', with a<br>
spatial light modulator (SLM) 26 illuminated with a beam of monochromatic light 24 from<br>
a light source 23, such as a laser diode or gas diode. This feature of the invention could also<br>
be implemented with white light, although the resultant Fourier transform optic patterns and<br>
spatially filtered optic patterns would be more blurred than with monochromatic light.<br>
Therefore, while this description of the invention will proceed based on monochromatic,<br>
preferably coherent, light, it should be understood that white light is a suitable, albeit not a<br>
preferred, substitute. The spatial light modulator (SLM) 26 can be optically addressable (0-<br>
SLM), such as the one illustrated in co-pending patent application 09/536,426, or it can be<br>
electrically addressable (E-SLM) and driven, for example, by a computer 20 in Figure 5 or<br>
by a video camera (not shown). As is known by persons skilled in the art, a spatial light<br>
modulator (SLM) can "write" an image into a polarized beam of light 25 by rotating or<br>
partially rotating the polarization plane of the light on a spatial basis across the beam 25 so<br>
that, upon reflection as beam 27, it is either transmitted through, or reflected by, the<br>
polarization beam splitter 116, depending on what is needed to create the image 12' in<br>
monochromatic light. In an optically addressed SLM (not shown), the image plane is<br>
addressed on a spatial basis by incident light energy on a semiconductor material adjacent<br>
the polarization rotating material (usually a liquid crystal material), whereas, in an<br>
electrically addressable SLM 26, the liquid crystal, polarization rotating material is<br>
addressed electrically on a pixel by pixel basis. The pixel portions of the polarized light that<br>
have the plane of polarization rotated 45 degrees as they pass once through the liquid crystal<br>
material, whereupon such light is reflected and passed back through the liquid crystal again,<br>
where it is rotated another 45 degrees. Thus, the pixels of light in polarized beam 25 that<br>
have their plane of polarization rotated in the SLM 26 are reflected and emerge from the<br>
SLM along the optical path 27, which has an optic axis 40 that coincides with the optic axis<br>
of the incident beam 25 but in an optic pattern imposed by the E-SLM 26 that forms an<br>
image 12' and with its plane of polarization rotated 90 degrees from the plane of<br>
polarization of the incident beam 25. The remaining pixels of light, which do not undergo<br>
rotation of the plane of polarization, are also reflected, but they can be separated from those<br>
that have undergone rotation of plane of polarization, as will be explained below. Various<br>
light intensities or brightnesses of the image 12 can be recreated in gray scales in image 12'<br>
by partial rotations of plane of polarization.<br>
In the Figure 5 embodiment, the coherent light beam 24 from laser source 23 is<br>
passed first through a polarizer 28 to create a polarized beam of coherent light 25 with all<br>
the light polarized in one plane, such as, for example, but not for limitation, in the s-plane,<br>
as indicated by 25(s). The s-polarized beam 25(s) is then passed through a spatial filter 110<br>
comprised essentially of a pin hole 112 and a lens 114 to focus the beam 25(s) on the pin<br>
hole 112. This spatial filter 110 is provided primarily to condition the beam 25(s) to get a<br>
good Gaussian wavefront and, if necessary, to limit the power of the beam 25(s). Lens 114a<br>
then columnates the light.<br>
The beam 25(s) is then passed through a polarizing beam splitter 116, which reflects<br>
light polarized in one direction at plane 118 and transmits light polarized in the orthogonal<br>
direction. In this example, the polarizing beam splitter 116 reflects s-polarized light and<br>
transmits p-polarized light, and it is oriented to reflect the s-polarized beam 25(s) toward the<br>
electrically addressed spatial light modulator (E-SLM) 16. the monochromatic, preferably<br>
coherent, light beam 25(s) incident on the E-SLM 36 provides the light energy that is<br>
utilized to carry the shape content of the image 12' for further analysis, characterization, and<br>
encoding according to this invention.<br>
As mentioned above, there are many ways of "writing" images 12, 14,..., n into a<br>
light beam, one of which is with an E-SLM 16. In this example, computer 20 has the<br>
content of image 12 digitized, so the computer 20 can transmit digital signals via link 21 to<br>
the E-SLM 26 in a manner that addresses and activates certain pixels in the E-SLM 26 to<br>
"write" the image 12' into reflected light beam 27(p), as is understood by persons skilled in<br>
the art. Essentially, the addressed pixels rotate the plane of polarization by 90 degrees from<br>
the s-plane of incident beam 25(s) to the p-plane of reflected beam 27(p), or by some lesser<br>
amount for gray-scales, in a manner such that the reflected light energy with partially or<br>
fully 90-degree polarization plane rotation is in an optical pattern of the image 12'. Of<br>
course, persons skilled in the art will also understand that the image 12' could also be<br>
created with an E-SLM that operates in an opposite manner, i.e., the plane of polarization is<br>
rotated in reflected light, except where pixels are activated, in which case the computer 20<br>
would be programmed to activate pixels according to a negative of the image 12 in order to<br>
write the image 12' into reflected beam 27. Either way, the emerging beam 27(p) of<br>
coherent light, carrying image 12', is p-polarized instead of s-polarized or vice versa.<br>
Consequently, in the above example, the monochromatic light beam 27(p), with its light<br>
energy distributed in an optic pattern that forms the image 12', is transmitted by the<br>
polarizing beam splitter 116 to the FT lens 30, instead of being reflected by it.<br>
The positive Fourier transform (FT) lens 30, as explained above is positioned in the<br>
light beam 27(p) and redistributes the monochromatic light energy from the image 12' into<br>
its Fourier transform optic pattern 32, which occurs at the focal plane of the FT lens 30.<br>
Therefore, the segmented radial SLM SO of this invention has to be positioned in the focal<br>
plane of the FT lens 30, as indicated by the focal distance F in Figure 5, and the FT lens 30<br>
is also positioned the same focal distance F from the E-SLM 26, so that the E-SLM 26 is<br>
also in a focal plane of the lens 30. As also explained above, the complex amplitude<br>
distribution of light energy 34 in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 at the focal plane of<br>
the FT lens 30 is the Fourier transform of the complex amplitude distribution in the image<br>
12'. The Fourier transform optic pattern 32 has all of the light energy from the image 12'<br>
distributed into the symmetrical pattern 32 based on the spatial frequencies of the image 12',<br>
with intensities of the light energy in the various spatial frequency distributions 34 based on<br>
the light energy in the corresponding portions of the image 12' where those respective<br>
spatial frequencies occur.<br>
The Fourier transform optic pattern 32, as mentioned above, is symmetrical from top<br>
to bottom and from left to right, so that each semicircle of the Fourier transform optic<br>
pattern 32 contains exactly the same distribution and intensity of light energy as its opposite<br>
semicircle. Light energy from lower spatial frequencies in the image 12' are distributed<br>
toward the center or optical axis 40 of the Fourier transform optic pattern 32, while the light<br>
energy from higher spatial frequencies in the image 12' are distributed farther away from the<br>
optical axis 40 and toward the outer edge of the pattern 32, i.e., farther radially outward<br>
from the optic axis 40. Light energy from features in the image 12' that are distributed<br>
vertically in the image 12' to create those various spatial frequencies is likewise distributed<br>
vertically in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32. At the same time, light energy from<br>
features in the image 12' that are distributed horizontally in the image 12' to create those<br>
various spatial frequencies is distributed horizontally in the Fourier transform optic pattern<br>
32. Therefore, in general, light energy from features in the image 12' that are distributed in<br>
any angular orientation with respect to the optical axis 40 to create the various spatial<br>
frequencies in the image 12' is also distributed at those same angular orientations in the<br>
Fourier transform optic pattern 32. Consequently, by detecting only light energy distributed<br>
at particular angular orientations with respect to the optical axis 40 in the Fourier transform<br>
optic pattern 32, such detections are characteristic of features or details in the image 12' that<br>
are aligned linearly in such particular angular orientations. The radial distributions of such<br>
detected light energy at each such angular orientation indicate the intricateness or sharpness<br>
of such linear features or details in the image 12', i.e., spatial frequency, while the intensities<br>
of such detected light energy indicate the brightness of such features or details in the image<br>
12'.<br>
Therefore, a composite of light energy detections at all angular orientations in the<br>
Fourier transform optic pattern 32 creates a composite record of the shapes, i.e., angular<br>
orientations, intricateness or sharpness, and brightness, of linear features that comprise the<br>
image 12'. However, for most practical needs, such as for encoding shape characteristics of<br>
images 12, 14,..., n for data base storing, searching, retrieval, comparison and matching to<br>
other images, and the like, it is not necessary to record such light energy detections for all<br>
angular orientations in the Fourier transform pattern 12'. It is usually sufficient to detect<br>
and record such light energy distributions and intensities for just some of the angular<br>
orientations in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 to get enough shape characterization to<br>
be practically unique to each image 12, 14,..., n for data base storage, searching, and<br>
retrieval of such specific images 12, 14,..., n. For purposes of explanation, but not for<br>
limitation, use of 11.25-degree angular increments is convenient and practical, because<br>
there are sixteen (16) 11.25-degree increments in 180 degrees of rotation, which is sufficient<br>
characterization for most purposes and has data processing and data storage efficiencies, as<br>
explained in co-pending U.S. patent application, serial no. 09/536,426. However, other<br>
discrete angular increments could also be used, including constant increments or varying<br>
increments. Of course, varying increments would require more computer capacity and more<br>
complex software to handle the data processing, storing, and searching functions.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the segmented radial SLM 50, shown<br>
in Figure 1, with its active optic sectors 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590,<br>
600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650 shown in Figure 2, is used to select only light energy from<br>
specific angular orientations in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 for detection at any<br>
instant in time or increment of time on the detector array 82. As explained above with<br>
reference to the sector 500 in Figure 3, which, except for angular orientation, is typical of all<br>
the other sectors 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590,600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650<br>
in Figure 2, any active optic segment, e.g., segments 502, 504, 506, 508, in vertical sector<br>
500, can be addressed via respective electric traces, e.g., traces 503, 505, 507, 509 for sector<br>
500, so that the detector array 82 can detect light energy distribution and intensity (I) in the<br>
Fourier transform optic pattern 32 at any angular orientation (R) of a sector 500, 510, 520,<br>
530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650 and at selected radial<br>
distances from the optic axis 40. For example, sector 500 is oriented substantially vertical<br>
in relation to the optic axis 40. If all of the active optic segments 502, 504, 506, 508 of<br>
sector 500 are selected and activated simultaneously, virtually all of the light energy that is<br>
distributed vertically in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 will be incident on, and<br>
detected by, the photodetector array 82 (Figure 5). However, if only one of the active optic<br>
segments, for example, outer segment 508, is selected and activated, then only the light<br>
energy in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 that is distributed vertically and the farthest<br>
radially outward from the optic axis 40 will be detected by the photodetector array 82.<br>
Thus, any one, all, or combination of the active optic segments, e.g., 502, 504, 506, 508, can<br>
be activated sequentially or simultaneously to detect and record various distributions of<br>
light energy in the Fourier transform optic pattern 32. Also, any one or more sectors 500,<br>
510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630,640,650 can be selected<br>
and activated sequentially, simultaneously, or in various combinations, depending on the<br>
detail or particular light energy distributions in the FT optic pattern 32 it is desired to detect.<br>
The preferred, but not essential, shape of the active optic sectors, e.g., sector 500, in<br>
the segmented radial SLM 50 is a narrow, elongated wedge. The width of the wedge will<br>
depend on the light energy available or needed and the optic resolution desired. A wider<br>
sector will direct more light energy 34 to the detector 80, but precision of line or feature<br>
resolution of the image 12' will degrade slightly. A narrower sector will get better line<br>
resolution, but with a corresponding increase in the complexity of the resulting pattern<br>
shape generalization and complexity and a decrease in light energy directed to the detector<br>
80. There may also be a practical limitation as to how narrow and close the wedges can be<br>
made with the connecting electric traces in a limited active optic area 54 in an economic and<br>
efficient manner. Therefore, a desirable balance between these resolution, detectability, and<br>
size considerations may be struck in choosing sector size. Also, for specialized<br>
applications, sectors of different shapes (not shown), such as ovals, or other shapes could be<br>
used to capture shapes other than lines from the image 12.<br>
The number of active optic segments in a sector, e.g., the four segments 502, 504,<br>
506, 508 sector 500, also has similar constraints. Smaller segments direct less light energy<br>
to the detector 80, but may provide more resolution of shape characteristics of the image<br>
12', whereas larger segments direct more light to the detector 80, thus are more easily<br>
detectable, but resolution decreases. For lower resolution applications or requirements, the<br>
sectors may not even need to be divided into segments, and this invention includes radial<br>
spatial light modulators in which each sector 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560,570, 580,<br>
590,600, 610, 620, 630, 640,650 is not segmented, thus comprises a single active optic<br>
element for each sector. However, the same lower resolution effect can be achieved in the<br>
illustrated embodiment 50 in Figures 1 - 3 by activating all the segments 502, 504, 506, 508<br>
in a sector simultaneously, as described above.<br>
In the preferred embodiment 50, each sector, e.g., sector 500, comprises four<br>
individually addressable, active optic segments, e.g., segments 502, 504, 506, 508, as shown<br>
in Figure 3, although any number of segments other than four can also be used according to<br>
this invention. The length of each successive radial outward segment is twice as long as the<br>
next adjacent radially inward segment. Thus, in sector 500, the near inner segment 504 is<br>
about twice as long as the inner segment 502. Likewise, the near outer segment 506 is<br>
about twice as long as the near inner segment 504, and the outer segment 508 is about twice<br>
as long as the near outer segment 506. Expressed another way, if the radial length of inner<br>
segment 502 is L, the radial length of near inner segment 504 is 2L, the radial length of the<br>
near outer segment 506 is 4L, and the radial length of the outer segment 508 is 8L. The<br>
distance d between the optic axis 40 and the inner edge 501 of inner segment 502 is about<br>
the same as the length L of inner segment 502, so the diameter of the center area 57 is about<br>
2L. These proportional lengths of the active optic segments enable the inner segments (e.g.,<br>
502) to capture shape features of the image 12' that have sizes] in a range of about 25 - 50<br>
percent of the size of the image 12' produced by the spatial light modulator 26 in Figure 5,<br>
the near inner segments (e.g., 504) to capture shape features of the image 12' that have sizes<br>
in a range of about 12'/j - 25 percent of the size of image 12', the near outer segments (e.g.,<br>
506) to capture shape features of the image 12' that have sizes in a range of about 614 - 12'/i<br>
percent of the size of image 12, and the outer segments (e.g., 508) to capture shape features<br>
of the image 12' that have sizes in a range of about 3 1/8-6^4 percent of the size of the<br>
image 12". Therefore, any features of the image 12' that have sizes over 50 percent of the<br>
size of image 12', which light energy is incident on the center area portion 41, can either be<br>
captured and detected as an indicator of general brightness of the image 12' for intensity<br>
control or calibration purposes or just ignored and not captured or detected at all, because<br>
there is little, if any, useable shape information or content in the light energy that comprises<br>
that 50 percent of the size of the image 12'. Likewise, the approximately 3 1/8 percent of<br>
the size content of the image 12' that is radially outward beyond the outer segments is not<br>
detected and can be ignored in this preferred configuration. The light in the center 41 can<br>
be made optically active to capture light energy incident thereon, if it is desired to capture<br>
and detect such light energy for general brightness indication, intensity control, or<br>
calibration purposes, as will be understood and within the capabilities of persons skilled in<br>
the art, once they understand this invention. Of course, other configurations of the<br>
segmented radial SLM 50 could also be made and used within the scope of this invention.<br>
While the radial configuration of the active optic sectors with or without the<br>
multiple, active optic segments in each sector in the spatial light modulator 50 is a<br>
significant feature of this invention, persons skilled in the art of designing and fabricating<br>
spatial light modulators can readily understand how such a spatial light modulator 50 can be<br>
constructed and function, once they become familiar with the features and principles of this<br>
invention, and there are many known materials, fabrication techniques, and the like, known<br>
to persons skilled in the art that could be used to design, make, and use state-of-the-art<br>
spatial light modulators that are applicable to the specialized spatial light modulator<br>
embodiments of this invention. Therefore, a detailed recitation of such available materials<br>
is not necessary to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use this invention. Never-<br>
the-less, reference is now made to Figure 4 in combination with Figures 1 - 3 and 5 to<br>
illustrate how selection and activation of any particular active optic segment, for example,<br>
near outer segment 506 and outer segment 508, function to selectively enable detection of<br>
light energy from the Fourier transform optic pattern 32 that is incident on such segments.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, the optic active segments 506, 508, which are typical of<br>
other active optic segments, are part of an integrated circuit 52, which is mounted on a chip<br>
base or platform 56. The integrated circuit 52 has a variable birefringent material 180, such<br>
as a liquid crystal material, sandwiched between two transparent substrates 182, 184, such<br>
as high quality glass. The variable birefringent material 180 is responsive to a voltage to<br>
change its birefringence in the area of the voltage, which results in rotation of the plane of<br>
polarization of the light that passes through the material 180. The division between near<br>
outer segment 506 and outer segment 508 is made by a separation of respective metal layers<br>
186, 188. An intervening dielectric or electrical insulation material 185 can be used to<br>
maintain electrical separation of these metal layers 186, 188. As shown by a combination of<br>
Figures 3 and 4, electrically conductive trace 507 is connected to the metal layer 186 of near<br>
outer segment 506, and trace 509 is connected to the metal layer 188 of outer segment 508.<br>
In fact, the electric traces 507, 509 and metal layers 186, 188 can be deposited the same<br>
metal and can be on the back substrate 184 concurrently with their respective metal layers<br>
186, 188 during fabrication of the integrated circuit 52, as would be understood and within<br>
the capabilities of persons skilled in the art of designing and fabricating spatial light<br>
modulators, once they are informed of the principles of this invention. Therefore, the metal<br>
layers 186, 188 can be addressed individually through their respective connected traces 507,<br>
509 by connecting positive (+) or negative (-) voltages Vt and V2, respectively, to traces<br>
507, 509.<br>
A transparent conductive layer 190 deposited on the front substrate 182 is connected<br>
by another lead 513 to another voltage V3. Therefore, a voltage can be applied across the<br>
portion of the liquid crystal material 180 that is sandwiched between the metal layer 186<br>
and the transparent conductive layer 190 by, for example, making V1 positive and V3<br>
negative and vice versa. Likewise, when a voltage can be applied across the portion of the<br>
liquid crystal material 180 that is sandwiched between the metal layer 188 and the<br>
transparent conductive layer 190 by, for example, making V2 positive and V3 negative and<br>
vice versa.<br>
As mentioned above, the function of the respective segments 506, 508 is to rotate<br>
the plane of polarization of selective portions of the incident light beam 27(p) so that those<br>
portions of the light beam 27(p), which carry corresponding portions of the Fourier<br>
transform optic pattern 32, can be separated and isolated from the remainder of the light<br>
beam 27(p) for detection by the photodetector array 82 (Figure 5). As understood by<br>
persons skilled in the art, there are a number of spatial light modulator variations, structures,<br>
and materials that can yield the desired functional results, some of which have advantages<br>
and/or disadvantages over others, such as switching speeds, light transmission efficiencies,<br>
costs, and the like, and many of which would be readily available and satisfactory for use in<br>
this invention. Therefore, for purposes of explanation, but not for limitation, the segmented<br>
radially spatial light modulator illustrated in Figure 4 can have respective alignment layers<br>
192, 194 deposited on the transparent conductive layer 190 on substrate 182 and on the<br>
metal layers 186, 188 on substrate 184. These alignment layers 192, 194 are brushed or<br>
polished in a direction desired for boundary layer crystal alignment, depending on the type<br>
of liquid crystal material 180 used, as is well-understood in the art. See, e.g., J.Goodman,<br>
"Introduction to Fourier Optics, 2nd ed., chapter 7 (The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc.)<br>
1996. An antireflective layer 196 can be deposited on the outside surface of the glass<br>
substrate 182 to maintain optical transmissive efficiency.<br>
One example system, but certainly not the only one, can use a liquid crystal material<br>
180 that transmits light 27(p) without affecting polarization when there is a sufficient<br>
voltage across the liquid crystal material 180 and to act as a 1/4-wave retarder when there is<br>
no voltage across the liquid crystal material. An untwisted crystal material 180 that is<br>
birefringent in its untwisted state can function in this manner. Thus, for example, when no<br>
voltage is applied across the liquid crystal material 180 in segment 508, there is no<br>
molecular rotation of the liquid crystal material 180 in outer segment 508, and the liquid<br>
crystal material in outer segment 108, with the proper thickness according to the liquid<br>
crystal manufacturer's specifications, will function as a 1/4-wave plate to convert p-polarized<br>
light 27(p) incident on outer segment 508 to circular polarization as the light passes through<br>
the untwisted liquid crystal material 180. Upon reaching the metal layer 188, which is<br>
reflective, the light is reflected and passes back through the liquid crystal material to<br>
undergo another 1/4-wave retardation to convert the circular polarization to linear<br>
polarization, but in the s-plane, which is orthogonal to the p-plane. The reflected light<br>
61(s), therefore, has its plane of polarization effectively rotated by 90 degrees in relation to<br>
the incident light 27(p).<br>
Meanwhile, if there is a sufficient voltage on, for example, the near outer segment<br>
506, to rotate the long axes of the liquid crystal molecules into alignment with the direction<br>
of propagation of the incident light waves 27(p), thereby eliminating the birefringence of<br>
the liquid crystal material 180, then there is no change of the linear polarization of the light<br>
on either its first pass through the liquid crystal material 180 or on its second pass through<br>
the liquid crystal material after being reflected by metal layer 186. Consequently, under this<br>
condition with a voltage applied across the liquid material 180 in ear outer segment 506, the<br>
reflected light 61(p) is still polarized in the p-plane, i.e., the same plane as the incident light<br>
27(p).<br>
Many liquid crystal materials require an average DC voltage bias of zero, which can<br>
be provided by driving the voltage V3 with a square wave function of alternating positive<br>
and negative voltages for equal times. Therefore, for no voltage across the liquid crystal<br>
material 180, the other voltages V1, V2, etc., can be driven in phase with equal voltages as<br>
V3. However, to apply a voltage across the liquid crystal material 180 adjacent a particular<br>
metal layer 186, 188, etc., to activate that particular segment 506, 508, etc., as described<br>
above, the respective voltage V1 or V2, etc., can be driven out of phase with V3. If the<br>
frequency of the square wave function is coordinated with the switching speed of the liquid<br>
crystal material 180, one-half cycle out of phase for a voltage V1, V2, etc., will be enough to<br>
activate the liquid crystal material 180 to rotate the plane of polarization of the light as<br>
described above.<br>
As mentioned above, other alternate arrangements and known liquid crystal<br>
materials can reverse the results from an applied voltage. For example, a twisted liquid<br>
crystal material 180 may be used to rotate plane of polarization under a voltage and to not<br>
affect plane of polarization when there is no voltage.<br>
Referring again primarily to Figure 5 with continuing secondary reference to Figure<br>
4, the light energy in the beam 27'(p), which passes through the polarizing beam splitter 116<br>
and 70 without reflection by planes 116 and 72, is focused as the Fourier transform optic<br>
pattern 32 on the segmented radial SLM 50. Selected active optic segments, for example,<br>
segments 502, 504, 506, 508, in the segmented radial SLM, can rotate the plane of<br>
polarization of portions of the incident light beam 27(p), as described above, in order to<br>
separate and isolate light energy from selected portions of the FT optic pattern 32 for<br>
detection by photodctector 80. The computer 20 can be programmed to provide signals via<br>
link 198 to the segmented radial SLM 50 to select and coordinate activation of particular<br>
segments, for example, segments 502, 504, 506, 508, with displays of particular images 12,<br>
14,..., n. The computer 20 can also be programmed to coordinate laser source 23 via a<br>
link 29 to produce the required light energy 24, when the selected segment of the segmented<br>
radial SLM 50 is activated.<br>
The reflected light 61 (s) from the segmented radial SLM 50, e.g., light polarized in<br>
the s-plane reflected from an activated segment, as explained above, does not pass back<br>
through the polarizing beam splitter 70 along with p-polarized reflected light. Instead, the<br>
s-polarized reflected light 61(s) is reflected by the plane 72 in the polarizing beam splitter<br>
70 to the detector 80. The lens 78 magnifies and focuses the isolated beam 61 (s) in a<br>
desired size on the detector array 82 of photodetector 80.<br>
The photodetector array 82, as mentioned above, can be a 16 x 16 array of individual<br>
light sensors 84, such as charge coupled devices (CCDs), as shown in Figure 5, or any of a<br>
variety of other sizes and configurations. The x, y coordinates of individual sensors 84 in<br>
the array 82 that detect light 61(s) can be communicated, along with light intensity (I)<br>
information, to the computer 20 or other controller or recording device via a link 86, where<br>
it can be associated with information bout the image 12, 14,..., n and the angular<br>
orientation and/or radial position of the activated segment(s) in the segmented radial SLM<br>
50 that provided the beam 61(s) to the detector 80.<br>
The spatial filtering process described above and its characterization of the image 12<br>
by shape content is illustrated in more detail in Figures 6a-c, 7a-c, 8a-c, 9a-c, and l0a-c.<br>
With reference first to Figure 6a, the active optic area 54 from Figures 1 and 2 is shown in<br>
Figure 6a with the example sectors 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600,<br>
610, 620, 630,640,650, but, to avoid unnecessary clutter, without the electric traces that<br>
were described above and shown in Figures 1-3. As mentioned above, the sectors can be<br>
any desired width or any desired angular orientation, but a convenient, efficient, and<br>
effective configuration is to provide sectors of 11.25°. For example, a circle of 360° divides<br>
into 32 sectors of 11.25° each, and a semicircle of 180° divides into sixteen sectors of 11.25°<br>
each. Further, as mentioned above, the light energy distribution in any semicircle of a<br>
Fourier transform optic pattern 32 is symmetric with its opposite semicircle. Therefore,<br>
detection of the light energy pattern in one semicircle of the FT optic pattern 32, for<br>
example, in the semicircle extending from 0° to 180°, provides effective information for the<br>
entire image 12', and detection of the light energy pattern in the opposite semicircle<br>
extending from 180° to 360° provides the same information. Consequently, to alleviate<br>
clutter and better accommodate the electric traces (shown in Figures 1 - 3, some of sectors<br>
can be positioned in one semi-circle of the optic area 54 with intervening spaces to<br>
accommodate the electric traces (shown in Figures 1 - 3), while others of the sectors can be<br>
positioned in the opposite semicircle of the optic area 54 diametrically opposite to the<br>
intervening spaces. For example, when the circle is divided into 32 sectors of 11.25° each,<br>
only 16 of those sectors, such as sectors 500,510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590,<br>
600, 610,620, 630, 640, 650 have to be optically active to detect all of the light energy<br>
incident on the area 54. All 16 of such optically active sectors could be positioned in one<br>
semicircle of the area 54, or, as explained above, it is more convenient and less cluttered to<br>
position some of the optically active sectors in one semicircle with intervening spaces and<br>
others in the opposite semicircle diametrically opposite to the intervening spaces. In the<br>
example of Figure 6a, any eight of the sectors, e.g., sectors 640,650, 500, 510, 520, 530,<br>
540, 550, separated by non-active areas 641,651, 501, 511, 521, 531, 541, are positioned in<br>
one semicircle of the area 54, while the remaining eight of the sectors 560, 570, 580, 590,<br>
600, 610, 620, 630, also separated by non-active areas 561, 571, 581, 591, 601, 611,621,<br>
can be positioned in the opposite semicircle, as shown in Figure 6a. When each of the 16<br>
active optic sectors 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630,<br>
640,650 in this arrangement is positioned diametrically opposite a non-active area, the<br>
symmetry of the FT optic pattern 32 (Figure 5) effectively allows all of the light energy<br>
distribution in FT optic pattern 32 to be directed with these sectors.<br>
This principle also facilitates design and fabrication of an effective segmented radial<br>
SLM 50, because, for every active optic sector, there can be an adjacent inactive sector or<br>
area available for placement of electrically conductive traces to the segments, as shown by<br>
reference back to Figures 2 and 3. For example, the inactive area 651 between active optic<br>
segments 500 and 650 accommodates placement of traces 503, 505, and 507 (shown in<br>
Figure 3) to respective segments 502, 504, 506 of active optic sector 500. To provide active<br>
optic sectors to detect light energy incident on the non-active areas, for example, the non-<br>
active area 501 in Figure 6a between active optic sectors 500, 510, the above-described<br>
symmetry principle is applied by providing an active optic sector 590 in a position<br>
diametrically opposite the said non-active area 501. Therefore, detection of light energy<br>
detected in the active optic sector 590 is effectively detecting light energy incident on the<br>
non-active area 501 between sectors 500, 510. In order to have an active optic sector<br>
positioned diametrically opposite a non-active area, two of the active optic sectors, e.g.,<br>
sectors 550, 560 are positioned adjacent each other without any significant intervening non-<br>
active area, so the diametrically opposite non-active area 631 is twice as big as other non-<br>
active areas. Therefore, according to the above-described symmetry principle, substantially<br>
all light energy 34 of FT optic pattern 32 (Figure 5) is detectable by the sixteen 11.25°<br>
active optic sectors 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620,630,<br>
640,650.<br>
Returning now to Figure 6a, vertical angular orientation is arbitrarily designated as<br>
0°, so horizontal angular orientation is at 90°. Each active optic sector 500, 510, 520, 530,<br>
540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620,630, 640, 650 is about 11.25°. Active optic<br>
sectors from sector 640 clockwise to sector 550 are each separated by respective non-active<br>
areas 641, 651, 501, 511, 521, 531, 541 of 11.25°. Therefore, each active optic sector from<br>
sector 560 clockwise to sector 630 is positioned diametrically opposite a respective non-<br>
active area 561, 571, 581, 591,601,611, 621. Therefore, to detect all the light energy<br>
distribution in the FT optic pattern 32 (Figure 4) incident on the active area 54 can be<br>
detected in 11.25° intervals by the 11.25° sectors 500, 510, 520, 503, 504, 550, 560, 570,<br>
580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630,640, 650 positioned as described above.<br>
For example, light energy characteristic of that incident on both the vertical 11.25°<br>
sector 500 centered at 0° as well as on the non-active area 581 centered at 180° can be<br>
detected by effectively activating the active optical segments 502, 504, 506, 508 of sector<br>
500. Light energy characteristic of that incident on the 11.25° sector 590 centered at<br>
191.25" as well as on the non-active area 501 centered at 11.25° can be detected effectively<br>
by activating the active optic segments of sector 590, because the active optic sector 590 is<br>
centered diametrically opposite the non-active area of 11.25°. Light energy characteristic of<br>
that incident on either the 11.25° sector 510 centered at 22.5° or the non-active area 591<br>
centered at 202.5° can be detected by activating the active optic segments of sector 510.<br>
Light energy characteristic of that incident on either the 11.25° non-active area centered at<br>
33.75° or active sector 600 centered at 213.75° can be detected by activating the active optic<br>
segments of sector 600, which is centered diametrically opposite 33.75° at 213.75". Light<br>
energy characteristic of that incident on either the 11.25° sector 520 centered at 45° or non-<br>
active area 601 centered at 225° can be detected by activating the active optic segments of<br>
sector 520. Light energy characteristic of that incident on either the 11.25° non-active area<br>
521 centered at 56.25° or the active sector 610 centered at 236.25° can be detected by<br>
activating the active optic segments of sector 610, which is centered diametrically opposite<br>
56.25° at 256.25°. Light energy characteristic of that incident on either the 11.25° sector<br>
530 centered at 67.5° or the non-active area 611 centered at 247.5° can be detected by<br>
activating the active optic segments of sector 530. Light energy characteristic of that<br>
incident on either the 11.25° non-active area 531 centered at 78.75° or active sector 620<br>
centered at 258.75° can be detected by activating the active optic segments of sector 620,<br>
which is centered diametrically opposite 78.75" at 258.75". Light energy characteristic of<br>
that incident on either the 11.25° sector 540 centered at 90° or non-active area 621 centered<br>
at 270° can be detected by activating the active optic segments of sector 540. Light energy<br>
characteristic of that incident on either the 11.25° non-active area 541 centered at 101.25° or<br>
the active sector 630 centered at 281.25° can be detected by activating the active optic<br>
segments of sector 630, which is centered diametrically opposite 101.25° at 281.25°. Light<br>
energy characteristic of that incident on either the 11.25° sector 550 centered at 112.5° the<br>
diametrically opposite portion of non-active area 631 that is centered at 292.5° can be<br>
detected by activating the active optic segments of sector 550. Light energy characteristic<br>
of that incident on the 11.25° sector 560 centered at 123.75°. The diametrically opposite<br>
portion of non-active area 631 that is centered at 303.75° can be detected by activating the<br>
active optic segments of sector 560. Light energy characteristic of that incident on the<br>
11.25° non-active area 561 centered at 135° or active sector 640 centered at 315° can be<br>
detected by activating the active optic segments of sector 640, which is centered<br>
diametrically opposite 135° at 315°. Light energy characteristic of that incident on the<br>
11.25° sector 570 centered at 146.25° or non-active area 641 centered at 326.25° can be<br>
detected by activating the active optic segments of sector 570. Light energy characteristic<br>
of that incident on the 11.25° non-active area 571 centered at 157.5° or active sector 650<br>
centered at 337.5° can be detected by activating the active optic segments of sector 650,<br>
which is centered diametrically opposite 157.5° at 337.5°. Finally, light energy<br>
characteristic of that incident on the 11.25° sectors 580 centered at 168.75° or non-active<br>
area 651 centered at 348.75° can be detected by activating the active optic segments of<br>
sector 580.<br>
While it would be unnecessarily cumbersome to illustrate and describe the shape<br>
detecting and characterizing functionality of all the active optic segments of all the sectors<br>
500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580,590, 600, 610, 620, 630,640, 650, it may be<br>
helpful for an understanding of the invention to illustrate and describe the functionality and<br>
results of activating several representative examples of the active optic segments in the<br>
active optic area 54. Therefore, Figure 6a illustrates activation of the outer segment 508 of<br>
the active optic sector 500 by depicting bands of light energy 34 from the FT optic pattern<br>
32 that are incident on and reflected by the outer segment 508. These bands of light energy<br>
34, which are dispersed fartherest radially outward in the vertical direction in the FT optic<br>
pattern 32, emanated originally from, and correspond to, substantially vertically oriented<br>
lines, edges, features, or details in the image 12' that have a higher spatial frequency, such<br>
as the substantially vertical lines of the bumper and grill parts 35 in Figure 6b. As<br>
explained above, the light energy 34 from the more intricate or closely spaced vertical parts<br>
or lines 66 (i.e., higher spatial frequency), such as those in the front bumper and grill<br>
portion 35 of image 12', are dispersed farther radially outward from the optical center or<br>
axis 40, thus detectable by activating outer segments 506, 508 of vertical sector 500, while<br>
the light energy 34 from the less intricate, more isolated and semi-isolated or farther spaced<br>
apart vertical parts, edges, or lines (i.e., lower spatial frequency), such as the substantially<br>
vertical parts or lines 66' in the trunk and rear bumper portions of the image 12' in Figure<br>
6b, are dispersed not so far radially from the optical center or axis 40 and would be more<br>
detectable by inner segments 502, 504. The intensity of the light energy 34 in those<br>
respective dispersion bands, as explained above, depends on the brightness of the<br>
corresponding respective vertical features 35,66, 66' in the image 12'. Again, the central<br>
portion 41 of the active optic area 54 can be ignored, if desired, because the light energy 54<br>
in and near the center or axis 40 of the Fourier transform 32 (Figure 5) emanates from<br>
features in image 12' with very low or virtually no spatial frequencies, such as the overall<br>
brightness of the image, which do very little, if anything, to define shapes. On the other<br>
hand, as also explained above, the center portion 41 can be fabricated as an active optic<br>
component to capture and reflect the light energy incident on the center portion 41 to the<br>
detector 80 as a measure of overall brightness, which may be useful in calibrating, adjusting<br>
brightness of the source light 25(s) (Figure 5), calibrating intensity (I) measurements of<br>
sensors 84 in detector 80, and the like.<br>
The light energy bands 34, when reflected by the activated outer segment 508, are<br>
filtered through the polarizing beam splitter 70 and projected in the filtered optic pattern 60,<br>
which is comprised primary of vertical lines or bands 62 of light energy illustrated<br>
diagrammatically in Figure 6c, to the photodetector 80 (Figure 5). As discussed above, the<br>
light energy in the filtered optic pattern 60 is detected by the light sensors 84 in detector<br>
array 82. The intensity (I) of light energy on each sensor 84 is recorded along with the<br>
sensor (pixel) location, preferably by x-y coordinates, and the angular orientation (R) of the<br>
sector 500. The radial position or scale (S) of the activated segment 508 is also recorded,<br>
for example, as RIXSel values described above. These values can be stored in a database<br>
102 in association with information about the characterized image 12, such as image<br>
identification (ID), source location (URL, database address, etc.) of the image 12, digital<br>
format, resolution, colors, texture, shape, subject matter category, and the like.<br>
To illustrate further, the near inner segment 504 of active optic sector 500 is shown<br>
in Figure 7a as being selected to rotate plane of polarization of selected portions of the light<br>
energy bands 34 from the FT optic pattern 32 for isolation by the polarizing beam splitter 70<br>
and then detection by the photodetector 80. This near inner segment 504 is also in the<br>
vertically oriented sector 500, but it is positioned or scaled radially closer to the optic axis<br>
40 than the outer segment 508, which was activated in the previous example. Therefore,<br>
this near inner segment 504, when activated, captures light energy 34 in the FT optic pattern<br>
32 that also corresponds to vertical lines, edges, etc., of the image 12', but to such lines,<br>
edges, etc., of lesser spatial frequency than those selected by the outer segment 508. For<br>
example, instead of the closely spaced, vertically oriented bumper and grill parts 35, the<br>
light energy 34 from the FT optic pattern 32 selected by the near inner segment 504 may be<br>
more characteristic of the more spatially semi-isolated vertical edge 66' of the trunk lid and<br>
other vertical lines and edges 66 of similar semi-isolation in the automobile image 12' in<br>
Figure 6b. Therefore, the light energy bands 62 in the resulting filtered beam 61(s), as<br>
shown in optic pattern 60 in Figure 7c, are characteristic of such vertical shape content 66,<br>
66'in the image 12'.<br>
Another example angular orientation of light energy 34 from the FT optic pattern 32<br>
is illustrated by Figures 8a-c. The near outer segment 526 in this example is activated to<br>
capture light from lines, edges, or features extending radially at an angular orientation of 45°<br>
from vertical. Such light energy 34 is characteristic of lines, edges, or features in the image<br>
12' that extend at about 45° and that have some spatial frequency, i.e., are not isolated, such<br>
as, perhaps, the window post and roof support 67 in Figure 8b. Such 45° oriented lines in<br>
the image 12' with even less spatial frequency, i.e., even more isolated, for example, the<br>
portions of the fender and hood edges 67' might be captured more by the near inner segment<br>
524 or inner segment 522, although it is possible that some of such light energy could also<br>
be captured by near outer segment 506. The reflected and filtered beam 61(s) with the<br>
optical pattern 60 for these 45° angular oriented shape contents have bands 62 of the light<br>
energy oriented at about 45°, as illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 8c. Such light energy<br>
bands 62 are detected by sensors 84 for photodetector 80 (Figure 5) and are recorded and<br>
stored as characteristic of the spatial frequency of 43"-oriented shape content of the image<br>
12".<br>
Capture and detection of horizontal portions of lines, edges, and features 68, 68' of<br>
the image 12' is accomplished by activation of one or more segments 542, 544, 546, 548 of<br>
Horizontal sector 540, which is oriented 90° from the vertical 0°. The portion of the light<br>
energy 34 that is reflected by any activated segment 542, 544, 546, 548 of the horizontal<br>
sector 540 is characteristic of all of the substantially horizontal features, parts, and lines 68<br>
of the image 12', as shown in Figure 9b. Some curved features, parts, or lines in the image<br>
12' have portions or line segments 68' that are also substantially horizontal, so those<br>
horizontal portions or line segments 68' also contribute to the light energy 34 that gets<br>
reflected by the horizontal sector 540 in Figure 9a. The bands 62 of light energy in the<br>
filtered pattern 60, shown in Figure 9c, resulting from the horizontal orientation of an<br>
activated segment 542, 544, 546, 548 in Figure 9a, are also oriented substantially horizontal<br>
and are indicative of some or all of the shape characteristics 68, 68" of image 12' that arc<br>
oriented substantially horizontal. Again, the inner segments 542, 544 are activated to detect<br>
light energy bands 34 from the FT optic pattern 32 that are dispersed closer to the optic axis<br>
40, thus are characteristic of lower spatial frequency, horizontal shape content of the image<br>
12", while higher spatial frequency, horizontal shape content can be detected by activating<br>
the outer segments 546, 548 of the horizontal sector 540. Thus, detection of the light energy<br>
bands 62 in Figure 9c by detector array 82 (Figure 5) facilitates encoding and recording of<br>
the horizontal shape characteristics of the image 12', as was described above.<br>
One more example activated segment 598 in sector 590, is illustrated in Figure 10a<br>
to describe the symmetric light energy detection feature described above. As explained<br>
above, the light energy bands 34 of the FT optic pattern 32 that are incident on the non-<br>
active area between the active optic sectors 500, 510 are symmetric with the diametrically<br>
opposite light energy bands 34, which are incident on the active optic segments 529, 594,<br>
569, 598 in sector 590. Therefore, activation of a segment, for example, outer segment 598,<br>
as illustrated in Figure 10a, will enable effective detection of the diametrically opposite,<br>
equivalent light energy 34 that is incident between the segments 508, 518 of respective<br>
sectors 500, 510. Likewise, activation of any other segment 592, 594, 596 enables effective<br>
detection of other diametrically opposite portions of light energy that is incident in the non-<br>
active area 501 between active sectors 500 and 510. Therefore, detecting light energy 34<br>
incident on the sector 590, which is centered at 191.25° in the example of Figure 10a, is the<br>
equivalent of detecting light energy 34 that is incident on the non-active area 501 centered<br>
at 11.25°. The opposite also holds, i.e., detection of light energy 34 incident on the vertical<br>
sector 500, as illustrated in Figures 6a and 7a and described above, is the equivalent to<br>
detecting light energy from the FT optic pattern 32 that is incident on the non-active area<br>
581 between active sectors 580 and 590.<br>
Referring again to Figures lOa-c, the light energy 34 detected in the sector 590<br>
corresponds to shape content 69, such as lines, edges, portions of curves, and the like in the<br>
image 12' that are oriented substantially at about 191.25°, which, being linear, can also be<br>
expressed as oriented at about 11.25°. The light energy bands 62 in the reflected and<br>
filtered optic pattern 60 also have that same angular orientation, which is characteristic of<br>
the linear shape content of the image 12' that has that angular orientation and that has higher<br>
spatial frequency if reflected by outer segments 596, 598 or lower spatial frequency if<br>
reflected by inner segments 592, 594. The optic patterns 60 resulting from such various<br>
reflected portions of the FT optic pattern 32 are detected by the sensors 84 in detector array<br>
82 for recording and storage, as described above.<br>
It should be clear by now that any particular angular orientation R of segments of<br>
sectors in the active optic area 54 will allow detection of all the shape characteristics of<br>
image 12' that have substantially that same angular orientation R. It should also be clear<br>
that radial outward spacing or scale (S) of the segments relates to spatial frequency of such<br>
shape characteristics. Thus, all of the shape characteristics of the image 12' can be detected<br>
by detecting the bands 62 of the respective filtered patterns 60 with the segments at all<br>
angular orientations. However, as mentioned above, it is sufficient for most purposes to<br>
detect some, preferably most, but not necessarily all, of the shape characteristics of the<br>
image 12' by choosing to detect the light energy bands 34 of filtered patterns 60 at certain<br>
selected increments of or angular orientation or rotation R. Obviously, the bigger the<br>
increments of angular orientation of the sectors where light energy bands 34 are detected,<br>
the less precise the detected shape characteristics or contents of the image 12' will be. On<br>
the other hand, the smaller the increments of angular orientation, the more data that will<br>
have to be processed. Therefore, when selecting the angular increments of sectors at which<br>
light energy bands 34 will be detected and recorded, it may be desirable to strike some<br>
balance between preciseness of shape characteristics needed or wanted and the speed and<br>
efficiency of data processing and storage required to handle such preciseness. For example,<br>
but not for limitation, it is believed that detection and recording of the shape characteristics<br>
at angular increments of in a range of about 5 to 20 degrees, preferably about 11.25-degrees,<br>
will be adequate for most purposes. Also, the angular area of detection can be varied. For<br>
example, even if active optic sectors are oriented to detect shape characteristics at angular<br>
increments of 11.25°, the active optic areas could be narrow, such as in a range of 3° to 8°,<br>
more or less, which would filter out some of the optic energy from the FT optic pattern 32<br>
between the sectors. However, such loss of light energy from non-active areas between<br>
sectors or other radially extending sensors, as described elsewhere in this specification, may<br>
not be detrimental shape characterization by this invention, depending on specific<br>
applications of the technology to particular problems or goals.<br>
Instead of the radially extending, wedge-shaped active optic sectors and segments of<br>
sectors described above, an alternate configuration can be comprised of radially extending,<br>
rectangular-shaped active optic modulators as illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 11.<br>
These rectangular-shaped modulators 500',510', 520', 530', 540', 550', 560', 570', 580', 590',<br>
600', 610', 620', 630', 640', 650' can be at the same or different angular orientations as the<br>
wedge-shaped sectors described above, and each angular orientation can comprise several<br>
rectangular, active optic segments, such as segments 502', 504', 506', 508' of the modulator<br>
500'. This arrangement does not capture as much of the light energy of an incident FT optic<br>
pattern 32 (Figure 5) as the wedge-shaped segments and sectors described above, but shape<br>
resolution may be greater.<br>
Another, albeit less efficient embodiment, is illustrated in Figure 12, where the<br>
desired sectors and segments, which are shown in phantom lines, can be formed by<br>
activating selected groups of light modulator elements 702 in a pixel array 700 type of<br>
spatial light modulator simultaneously. For example, a virtual outer segment 508" of a<br>
vertical sector 500" can be activated by activating simultaneously a segment group 508" of<br>
the light modulator pixel elements 602. While there are versatility advantages to this type<br>
of implementation, such advantages may be outweighed by the complexity and cost as<br>
compared to the simpler configurations described above.<br>
While the reflective spatial light modulator structure described above in connection<br>
with the cross-sectional view of Figure 4 may be applicable to all of the segmented radial<br>
SLM 50 configurations described above, an alternative transmissive spatial light modulator<br>
structure 50' illustrated in Figure 13 could also be used with each of the configurations. In<br>
this embodiment 50', the metal reflective layers 186, 188 are replaced by transparent<br>
conducting layers 186', 188', such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or any of a number of other<br>
well-known transparent conducting materials. Therefore, incident 27(p) may or may not<br>
have its plane of polarization rotated, depending on whether a voltage V+ is applied to<br>
either layer 186' or 188', but, instead of being reflected, the light is transmitted through the<br>
device 50' to emerge as light energy 61 (s) or 61 (p), as indicated in Figure 13. this device is<br>
mounted around its periphery in a base 56, so the base 56 does not interfere with the light<br>
61(s) and 61(p) propagation. A different liquid crystal material 180' and/or a different<br>
thickness of liquid crystal material than the liquid crystal material 180 for the Figure 4<br>
embodiment would be required, since the light passes only once through the liquid crystal<br>
material 180'. However, such materials and their applications are readily available and<br>
well-known in the art and can be implemented by persons skilled in the art, once the<br>
understand the principles of this invention. Also, since the light 61 (s) is transmitted rather<br>
than reflected, the polarizing beam splitter 70 (Figure 5) would also have to be positioned<br>
behind the segmented radial SLM 50' of Figure 13 instead of in front of it. However, this<br>
modification could also be implemented quite easily by persons skilled in the art, thus is not<br>
shown explicitly in Figure 5.<br>
The accuracy, versatility, and efficiency of shape characterizing, processing, storing,<br>
searching, comparing, and matching images according to this invention can be enhanced by<br>
some pre-processing of the images 12, 14,..., n when creating the optical patterns for the<br>
images 12', 14',. .., n' at the SLM 26 in Figure 5. One particularly beneficial method of<br>
such pre-processing is "ghosting" the image to allow more light energy into the optic<br>
pattern 12', thus also allowing more light energy into the FT optic pattern 32.<br>
With reference now to Figures 14a-c, the ghosting process of this invention is<br>
illustrated first with an image content of a simple dot, such as a typed period 600, which is<br>
illustrated as greatly enlarged in Figure 14a. The computer 20 (Figure 5) or other<br>
microprocessor can first create an image of only the edge 602 of the dot 600, as illustrated<br>
in Figure 14b. Myriad edge-finding software programs are available commercially to<br>
perform such edge-finding tasks, such as Labview IMAQ™ available from National<br>
Instrument Corporation, of 11500 Mopac Expressway, Austin, Texas. More complex<br>
images 12, 14,..., n would, of course, have more edge content. Elimination of non-edge<br>
content of the images 12, 14,..., n does not degrade the shape characterizing function or<br>
performance of this invention, because the edges define the shape characteristics and<br>
produce the detectable FT optic patterns 32. As was explained above, plain, uniform,<br>
unchanging portions of images, such as the side panel 36 of the automobile in image 12' or<br>
the clear blue sky in a landscape picture 14 do not contribute significant detectable shape<br>
content to such images. As also explained above, light energy from such plain, uniform,<br>
unchanging portions of images tends to focus on or very near the optic axis 40 in Fourier<br>
transform optic patterns 32, thus would be incident primarily on the center section 41 of the<br>
segmented radial SLM SO (see Figure 2) and is either not detected at all or detected only to<br>
determine background brightness of the image, as explained above.<br>
After the image 600 is converted to an optic pattern of the edge content 602 of the<br>
image 600, as illustrated in Figure 14b, it is ghosted by creating a plurality of ghost images<br>
602 the edge content 602. For example, as illustrated in Figure 14c, a plurality of ghost<br>
images 602A, 602b 602c are created and added to the optic pattern of the edge image 602.<br>
In this example, a first set of eight ghost images 602a is added a first radial distance r1<br>
outward from the original edge image 602 at 45° angular increments. A second set of eight<br>
more ghost images 602b are added another radial distance r2 outward from the ghost images<br>
602A and at 45° angular increments, and a third set of eight ghost images 602c are added<br>
another radial distance r3 outward and at 45° increments. Each of the ghost images 602 a,<br>
602b, 602c have the same shape and are of the same size as the original edge image 602.<br>
Therefore, while there is more light energy and more spatial frequency in the ghosted image<br>
602' of Figure 14c than in the edge image 602 of Figure 14b, there is no new shape content.<br>
Consequently, there will be both a wider radial dispersement and increased intensity of light<br>
energy 34 in the FT optic pattern 32 (Figure 5), which can be detected with the segmented<br>
radial SLM SO and detector 80. the higher intensity light energy makes it easier for the<br>
sensors 84 in detector 80 to detect the light energy diverted by the segmented radial SLM 50<br>
to the detector 80<br>
The wider radial dispersion of light energy in FT optic pattern 32 due to the higher<br>
spatial frequency content in the ghosted image 602' of Figure 14c, as compared to the non-<br>
ghosted image 602 of Figure 14b, would also make the recorded pixels of detected light<br>
energy by the sensors 84 (Figure 5) somewhat less precise, thus less unique to the image<br>
600 or 602 than would be obtained by producing the image 600 or 602 on the SLM 26<br>
instead of the ghosted image 602'. However, this decrease in resolution capability can<br>
actually be turned to an advantage for search and comparison applications, where near<br>
matches as well as matches are desired. As illustrated in Figure 14c, the initial edge image<br>
pattern 602 is bright, the nearest ring of ghost edge images 602A is less bright, the next ring<br>
of ghost edge images 602b is even less bright, and the outermost ring of ghost edge images<br>
602c is less bright yet. However, the ghost images 602a, 602b, 602c increase the spatial<br>
frequency of the image 602', thus cause more radial dispersion of the light energy bands 34<br>
in the FT optic pattern 32, so the portions of the light energy bands 34 that originate from<br>
the initial edge image 602 in the center of the ghosted pattern 602' are brighter, i.e., more<br>
intense, than portions of the light energy bands 34 that originate from the ghost images<br>
602A, 602b, 602c. Therefore, while more sensors 84 of the detector array 82 will detect<br>
light energy reflected by the segmented radial SLM SO to the detector 80 for a ghosted<br>
image 602', the sensors 84 that sense the highest intensity (I) light energy will be the sensors<br>
84 that correspond to the initial edge image 602, and those intensities can be recorded and<br>
stored for future access, analysis, searching, matching, and/or retrieving, as described<br>
above. The lesser intensities detected by other sensors 84 for light energy emanating from<br>
the nearest ring of ghost images 602A are also recorded and stored, as are those even lesser<br>
light intensities emanating from the other rings of ghost images 602b, 602c sensed by still<br>
other sensors 84. Therefore, in a search and matching process with other images, matches<br>
to the brightest or highest intensities of both images would indicate the highest probability<br>
that the respective images are the same. If no such match can be found to the brightest or<br>
highest intensity pixels, RIXels, or other records of optic patterns that are characterized as<br>
described above, then comparisons to lesser intensities corresponding to ghost images 602A,<br>
602b, 603c can be attempted to find near matches.<br>
The ghosting process is quite simple and can be scaled to achieve a desired result.<br>
Essentially, a software program can simply be applied to reproduce each pixel of an image<br>
at selected locations at selected distances and at selected angular orientations in relation to<br>
such pixel, as illustrated in the simple example of the dot 600 in Figures 14a-c. An example<br>
of this ghosting process in a slightly more complex image 610 in the shape of a house is<br>
illustrated in Figures 15a-c. The edges of the uniform or featureless areas of the house<br>
image 610 are found and produced in an edge image 612,, which maintains the shape<br>
content of the image 610, as explained above. Then the ghosting process described above is<br>
applied to the edge image 612, as illustrated in Figure 14c, to create ghost images 612A,<br>
612b, 612c at selected distances, angular orientations, and decreasing brightnesses the<br>
farther the ghost images 612a, 612b, 612c are from the initial edge image 612.<br>
The ghosting process of this invention can also be applied to images for which edges<br>
have not been found or produced, as described above. However, more pixel processing by<br>
the computer 20 or other processor would be required, and resulting shape resolution may<br>
not be as sharp.<br>
Since these and numerous other modifications and combinations of the above-<br>
described method and embodiments will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not<br>
desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and process shown and described<br>
above. For example, Accordingly, resort may be made to all suitable modifications and<br>
equivalents that fall within the scope of the invention as defined by the claims which follow.<br>
The words "comprise," "comprises," "comprising," "include," "including," and "includes"<br>
