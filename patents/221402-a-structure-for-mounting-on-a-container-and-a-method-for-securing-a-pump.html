				<td>CONSTANT DOSAGE PUMP SECURING DEVICE AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pump and a pump securing device for mounting a pump on a container, which ensure that the pump will operate with consistent dosage accuracy. More specifically, the present invention relates to <t low-profile pump and a mounting cup or ferrule which is securely mounted to the without crimping prevents variations in dosags size of allows venting container.></t>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
In the art of container-mounted pumps, it is known to crimp the pump on the neck of the container using a mounting cup or ferrule. Conventionally, it has been required, during a sub-assembly step, to crimp the mounting cup or ferrule to the pump body, so that the resulting assembly can be mounted as a unit to a container neck. In order to ensure proper sealing of the pump on the container, thereby to minimize leacage, it is conventional to use a resilient gasket or gaskets which interact with the container neck and/or the pump mousing. A disadvantage of such conventional arrangements is that when the pump is secured to the container by conventional mounting<br>
reconigues   e.g.,   crimping   --   the   lower   (i.e.,   axially inner)     gasket    is    often   compressed   during    the    crimping process,   and  the amount of lower gasket  compression cannot easily   be    controlled.       As   a   result,    variations   in   the amount    of    compression   of   the    Lower   gasket   will    cause variations   in the stroke length of   the pump piston,   due  to upward pressure on  the pump housing caused by the  crimped and   compressed gasket.     This   upward pressure  on   the  pump housing   can   cause   reduction   in   the   stroke   length   of   the pump piston in two ways:  first,   by moving the pump housing upwardly,   and second,   by causing  the upper portion of  the pump   housing   to   compress   the   outer   edges   of   the   upper (i.e.,   axially outer)   gasket   (also  called   the   diaphragm) and   thereby   forcing   down   the   central   part   of   the   upper gasket,    reducing   the   stroke   length   of   the   pump   piston. Dosage variations are therefore created during the process of   crimping   the pump  and  mounting  cup  to  the   container. Such dosage  variations,   in many us.es  of  container-mounted pumps,   are not acceptable.<br>
SUMMARY OF   INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a pump and pump securing device which eliminate the problems; with conventional pump securing techniques. The mounting cup of the present invention includes, at its axially-outer end, a radially-inwardly projecting axially-outer step and a radially-inwardly projecting axially-inner step. These steps are used to interact with a radially-projecting flange with axial slots on the pump housing, thsreby allowing the pump to be securely snapped into the mounting cup without the need for crimping. The inner and outer steps also control the position of the pump relative to the mounting cup. As a result, the steps prevent the pump housing from moving up during crimping, preventing compressing of the upper gasket or diaphragm, and thereby preventing variations in pump dosage resulting from pump housing movements relative to the mounting cup or ferrule during crimping or variations<br>
In the method of the present invention, at least one upper gasket or diaphragm is inserted into the mounting cup or ferrule, preferably, as the pump is snapped into the mounting cup or ferrule, by snapping the flange between inner and outer steps. An actuator may then be attached to the pump piston stem. The completed structure may thereafter be secured to the container by any known method, such a crimping, screwing etc.<br>
The present invention, therefore, provides a structure for mounting on a container, the structure comprising:<br>
•	a pump, the pump comprising a housing, characterized in that the<br>
housing comprising an axially outer surface; and<br>
•	a securing device, the securing device surrounding the pump when<br>
assembled to the pump, the securing device comprising a top, the<br>
securing device also comprising a radially-inwardly projecting first<br>
step, the first step being axially-inwardly spaced from the top,<br>
contact between the first step and the axially outer surface of the<br>
housing preventing movement of the pump housing toward the top.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of securing a pump, comprising the steps of:<br>
•	providing a pump comprising a housing having a radially outer<br>
surface, the housing comprising on the radially outer surface at least<br>
one radial projection, the radial projection comprising axially outer<br>
and axially inner surfaces;<br>
•	providing a securing device comprising a top, a radially-inwardly<br>
projecting first step axially-inwardly spaced from the top, and a<br>
radially-inwardly projecting second step axially-inwardly spaced from<br>
the first step; and<br>
•	snapping the at least one radial projection into a space between the<br>
first and second steps.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the specification and claims, when considered in connection with the attached sheets of drawings, illustrating one form of the invention, wherein like characters represent like parts and in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional, view of a pump and mounting cup of the present invention;<br>
Pig. 2 is a detail, cross- sectiona1 view of circled area I ;<br>
Fig. 3 is a detailed top viev along line III-III of Fig. 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
?ig. l is a cross-sectional view of a pump P of an embodiment of the present invention. Pump P includes a housing 1. in which a piston 2 slides. The pump P housing 1 can include a larger diameter section 1.1 and a smaller diameter section 1.2. The pump P piston 2 can include a larger diameter section 2.1, mating with and sliding reciprocally in larger diameter section 1.1, and a smaller diameter section 2.2, mating with and sliding reciprocally in smaller diameter section 1.2. Smaller diameter section 2.2 includes at least one slot 2.3 to allow  fluid in smaller diameter section 1.2 to flow into larger diameter<br>
section 1.1, and smaller diameter section 2.2 is preferably used to snap sliding seal 12 into place as the pump is being assembled. Piston 2 includes an outlet passage 3 on a pump stem 2.4 which leads to an atomizing nozzle 4. A sliding seal 12 seals the ir.let end of a pump chamber 13 created within housing 1. The sliding seal 12 can be of the type described in, e. o., U.S. Patent No. 5,277,559. A valva stem 8 and spring 22, at; known in the art of precompression pumps. can conr.rol the delivery of pressurized liquid to the nozzle 4, Atomizing nozzle 4 is housed in an actuator assembly 5. The pump P can be mounted on a container or bottle C having a neck N, as described in more detail below.<br>
The mounting cup or ferrule 5 of the present invention can reconstructed of a stepped design, including a larger diameter, axially-inner (i.e., relative to pump axis A) section \6.1 and a smaller diameter, axially-outer section 6,2.     Axially-inner  section  6.1  can  include  a circumferential indent 62 near the transition area 60 between axially-outer 6.2 and. axially-inner 6.1 sections. Indent 62 is useful for retaining a lower gasket 7.1 against transition area 60, and therefore for securely holding lower gasket 7.1 within mounting cup or ferrule 6, Lower gasket 7.1 is used to provide a seal against the upper end of neck N, ro thereby prevent leakage of liquid in container C between mounting cup or ferrule 6 and neck N- As is known in the, art, the lower end of axially-inner section 6.1 may be crimped or otherwise deformed to attach it to the lower surface L of a flange on neck N, or alternatively the lower end of axially-inner section 6.1 can include known securing structures -- i.e.,  screw threads - for securing the mounting cup or ferrule 6 to the neck N.<br>
Axially-outer section 6.2 may include an opening O to allow the pump " stem 2,4 of piston 2 to project therethrough. Axially-outer section 6.2 also includes radially-inwardly projecting, circumferential, axially-<br>
outer 71 and axially-inner 72 steps on its inner surface near the top 70. The steps 71, 72 may be formed by stamping or molding a circumferential ring 73 in the axially-outer section 6.2 of mounting cup or ferrule 6, or Alternatively, scamping or molding two indents in the axially-oute:r section 6.2 of mounting cup or ferrule 6. Axially-outer step 71 is axially spaced from the top 70 of mounting cup or ferrule 6 a distarce D (Fig. 2) which is equal to or slightly greater than the thickness t (Fig. 2) of an upper gasket or diaphragm 7.2. This spacing ensures that the pump P housing 1 cannot move up to compress upper gasket or diaphragm 7.2 -- because of the interaction of flange 80 and step 71 -- thereby preventing alteration of the dosage of the pump P resulting from upper gasket or diaphragm 7.2 compression.<br>
As shown particularly in the detail view of Fig. 2, the radially-outer surface of the axially-outer end of larger diameter section 1.1 includes at least one radial projection, which in the preferred embodiment is in the form of a flange BO with axial slots 81. Flange 80 is axially sized so as to snap into the gap between the axially-outer 71 and axially-inner 72 steps, such that the axially-outer step 71 prevents upward movement of the housing 1 relative to the mounting cup or ferrule 6 by contact with che axially outer surface 8.1 of flange 80, and the axially-inner step 72 prevents; downward movement of the housing 1 relative to the mounting cup or ferrule 6 by contact with the axially inner surface 8,2 of flange 80. As can be seen particularly in Fig. 3, flange 80, can include a series of slots 81 which are spaced circumferentially around the larger diameter section 1.1 and which slots 81 are sized to create vent paths V between the larger diameter section 1.1 and the mounting cup or ferrule 6. The larger diameter section 1.1 may include circumferentially-spaced notches 90 which assist in creating a vent path V between the larger diameter section 1.1 and lower gasket 7.1.<br>
cup or ferrule 6 by suitable manufacturing methods, upper<br>
gasket or diaphragm 7.2 and lower gasket 7.1 may be placed,<br>
respectively, in axially-outer 6.2 and axially-inner 6.1<br>
sections.  Upper gasket or diaphragm 7.2 may be inserted at<br>
the same time as pump P is" inserted into mounting cup or<br>
ferrule 6, by mounting upper gasket or diaphragm 7.2 on<br>
pump stem 2,4.  At least lower gasket 7.1 may be held in<br>
place by snapping or forcing it, between  circumferential<br>
indent 62 and transition area 60, or may be held in place<br>
by friction, without the need for circumferential indent<br>
62.  Thereafter, assembled pump P (less actuator 5) may be<br>
inserted into mounting cup or ferrule 6.    As an<br>
alternative,  lower  gasket  7,1  may be  inserted into<br>
mounting cup or ferrule 6 after insertion of assembled pump<br>
P into mounting cup or ferrule 6.  Pump P is inserted so<br>
that the pump stem 2.4 of piston 2 fits through opening O,<br>
and the flange 80 is snapped into the space between<br>
axially-outer 71 and axially-inner 72 steps ,  This snap fit<br>
prevents the need for any crimping of mounting cup or<br>
ferrule 6 to pump P.  Axially-outer step 71 prevents the<br>
top of housing 1 from contacting, and compressing upper<br>
gasket or diaphragm 7,2. The snap-in fit of pump P housing<br>
1 on counting cup or ferrule 6 ensures that the pump 1 and<br>
mounting cup or ferrule 5 can be securely assembled<br>
together as a unit without the need for crimping or other<br>
such steps requiring deformation of mounting cup or ferrule<br>
6.  The speed of such assembly, therefore, can be greatly<br>
increased.  After actuator 5 has been mounted on pump P,<br>
the entire assembly may be placed on the neck N of<br>
container C, and thereafter crimped or otherwise secured to<br>
neck N,<br>
In operation, depression of actuator 5 will cause the piston 3 to move downwardly. Such downward movement will draw a step S on piston 3 away from upper gasket or diaphragm 7.2. This movement creates a gap which produces<br>
a vent path V between the piston 3 and the upper gasket or diaphragm 7.1, allowing air to enter into the interior of<br>
container C along vent path V which passes between piston<br><br>
3   and   upper  gasket   or  diaphragm  7.2,    through  sloes   81   in flange   80,    between   axially-outer   section   6.2   and   larger diameter   section   1.1,    and   through   notches   90)    to   thereby vent   the   interior   of   the   container   C.      Axially-inner   72 step   will   prevent:   any  downward   force   on   actuator   5   from moving pump F relative  to mounting cup or  ferrule   6.     As   is known    id    the    art,    downward   movement    of    piston    2    will pressurize   any   liquid   in  pump  chamber   13   until   the   point where    the   pressure    overcomes    the    force    of    spring   22, thereby   moving   valve    stem   8   downward    and   allowing    the passage of pressurized liquid to nozzle  4.     Upon release of force on actuator 5,   spring 22 will ;push piston 2 upwardly, drawing liquid  into pump chamber 13  through  seal  12  until step   S   contacts   upper   gasket   7.2.       The   contact   between upper   gasket   or   diaphragm   7.2   and   step   S   seals   off   vent path V,   preventing  liquid from leaking through vent   path V. of   course,   it   will  be  recognized by those  skilled  in the   art   that   a   variety   of   variations   may  be  made   in   the construction of the above invention without  departing  from the  claims.
