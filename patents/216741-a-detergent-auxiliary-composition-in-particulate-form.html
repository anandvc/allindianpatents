				<td>A COMPOSITION COMPRISING A SURFACE DEPOSITION ENHANCING CATIONIC POLYMER.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to detergent auxiliary compositions in particulate form comprising a surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer, methods of making said detergent auxiliary compositions, laundry detergent compositions comprising said detergent auxiliary compositions and use of said surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer to enhance the deposition of a perfume onto a fabric surface.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Surface treatment compositions, such as fabric treatment compositions including laundry detergent compositions, typically comprise systems mat deposit actives onto the surface to be treated. For example, laundry detergent compositions may comprise active components that need to be deposited onto the fabric surface before they can carry out their intended action. These active components include perfumes.<br>
However, laundry detergent compositions are typically designed to remove material, i.e. soil, from the surface of a fabric during a laundering process. Therefore, the majority of the chemistry that is formulated into a laundry detergent composition is designed and tailored to carry out this task. Thus, it is difficult to deposit any active component onto a fabric surface during a laundering process due to this chemistry. This problem is especially true for active components that are liquid or liquefiable, such as perfumes, which are particularly troublesome to deposit onto a fabric surface during a laundering process.<br>
Attempts have been made to improve the deposition of perfume onto a fabric surface during a laundering process by using hydrophobia perfume raw materials that have high boiling points; thus not readily evaporating from the wash liquor and more readily associating with the fabric surface due to having an increased hydrophobic interaction with the fabric surface. These perfumes are known as quadrant 4 perfume raw materials and are described in more detail in US5500138 and US6491728. However, the disadvantage of using quadrant 4 perfumes in laundry detergent compositions is that the perfumer is very limited in the choice of perfume raw materials that he can use, and the odours these quadrant 4 perfumes deliver are very musky odours that are not always suitable for use in laundry detergent compositions. In addition, the deposition of<br>
quadrant 4 perfumes onto the surface of a fabric during a laundering process is still not very efficient and still needs to be improved.<br>
Other attempts to improve the fabric surface deposition of perfumes during a laundering process include the encapsulation of perfume raw materials, for example in starch to obtain a starch-encapsulated perfume accord. These starch-encapsulated perfume accords and their applications in laundry detergent compositions are described in more detail in WO99/55819. However, these starch-encapsulated perfume accords, although giving good wet stage odour benefits, are not designed to give optimal deposition of perfume onto the surface of a fabric during a laundering process, presumably being due to the fact that they are readily water-soluble and/or water-dispersible in the wash liquor and the majority of the perfume is lost in the wash liquor during the laundering process. Thus, there is a need to improve the deposition of perfume onto a fabric surface during a laundering process.<br>
Another approach is the loading of perfume onto porous carrier materials such as zeolite. This perfume-loaded zeolite approach is described in more detail in EP701600, EP851910, EP888430,EP888431,BP931130,EP970179,EP996703,US5691383,US5955419and WOO 1/40430. However, there is a risk that the perfume may leak from the zeolite onto the detergent matrix during storage and/or leak into the wash liquor (i.e. before the zeolite has been deposited onto a fabric surface) during a laundering process. In order to overcome this problem, attempts have also been made to encapsulate these perfume-loaded zeolites with starch; this is described in more detail in EP859828, EP1160311 and US5955419. However, there is still a need to further improve the deposition of perfume onto the surface of a fabric during a laundering process.<br>
There still remains a need to further improve the deposition of liquid or liquefiable active components such as perfume onto a fabric surface during a laundering process. The inventors have surprisingly found when a cationic polymer is incorporated into a detergent auxiliary composition in particulate form that comprises a solid support component, an active component and an encapsulating material, the surface deposition of the active component is improved. The inventors have also surprisingly found that when the cationic polymer is of a specific highly preferred weight average molecular weight or has a specific highly preferred average degree of cationic substitution or both, then the surface deposition of the active component is improved whilst avoiding cleaning negatives.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a detergent auxiliary composition in particulate form, comprising: (i) a liquid or iiquefiable active component; and (ii) a water-insoluble solid support component and (iii) a water-soluble and/or water dispersible encapsulating material; and (iv) optionally one or more adjunct components, characterised in that the composition further comprises (v) a surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer, wherein the cationic polymer is adsorbed onto the solid support component, and wherein the encapsulating material encapsulates the active component, the solid support component and the cationic polymer.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Detergent auxiliary composition in particulate form<br>
The detergent auxiliary composition is suitable for incorporation into a detergent composition, such as a laundry detergent composition; i.e. to make a fully formulated detergent composition. Alternatively, the detergent auxiliary composition is suitable for use in combination with a detergent composition such as a laundry detergent composition: i.e. as an additive to an already fully formulated detergent composition. The detergent auxiliary composition is in particulate form and comprises a liquid or Iiquefiable active component, a water-insoluble solid support component, a water-soluble and/or water dispersible encapsulating material, a surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer and optionally one or more adjunct components. All of these are discussed in more detail below.<br>
Since the composition is designed to deposit the active component onto the treated surface, the particle should be capable of coming into close proximity with the treated surface. One means of achieving this is to ensure that there is little or no repulsion between the particles of the composition and the treated surface, i.e. little or no electrochemical repulsion. It is therefore desirable to keep the electrokinetic potential, also known as the zeta potential, of the composition low in order to minimize any electrochemical repulsion that may occur between the composition and the treated surface. Zeta potential is described in more detail in the Physical Chemistry of Surfaces, 4th Edition, 1982, written by Adamson and published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, especially pages 198-205 of the above document.<br>
The zeta potential of the composition is typically determined by the following method:<br>
1,	Add lOg of composition to 200ml of water at 25°C and agitate for 5 minutes.<br>
2.	Centrifuge the product of step 1 for S.OOOrpra for lOmins in a Sigma 4-10 centrifuge.<br>
3.	Separate the sediment collected during step 2 and suspend 0.02g of the sediment in 500ml of an<br>
aqueous solution of ImM KC1.<br>
4.	Fill the chamber of a Brookhaven ZetaPlus Zeta Potential Analyzer with the above suspension<br>
of step 3.<br>
5.	Insert the full chamber into the analyser and analyse the zeta potential according the<br>
manufacturer's instructions.<br>
6.	Take an average of 10 readings to determine the zeta potential of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the composition has a zeta potential that is more neutral than -30mV, preferably more neutral than—20mV. It is believed that the lower (i.e. more neutral) zeta potential is achieved due to the presence of the surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer in the composition. The composition preferably comprises from 1.2wt% to 10wt% surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer.<br>
The composition typically has a mean particle size of from 5 micrometers to 200 micrometers, preferably from 10 to 50 micrometers, and/or typically no more than 10wt% of the composition has a particle size less than 5 micrometers and/or typically no more than 10wt% of the composition has a particle size\greater than 80 micrometers. These particle size requirements and distributions are especially preferred when the detergent auxiliary composition is incorporated in a laundry detergent composition, as particles having these particle size requirements and distributions do not segregate in the laundry detergent composition during transport and storage, and are stable in the laundry detergent composition during storage.<br>
The composition may be obtainable, and/or may be obtained, by an agglomeration, spray-drying, freeze-drying or extrusion process. However, there is a highly preferred order in which the components that make up the composition are contacted to each other during the process of making the composition. This preferred process is described in more detail below.<br>
Active component<br>
The active component is in a liquid or liquefiable form. Preferably the active component is in liquid form. The active component typically needs to be brought into close proximity with or even deposited onto the treated surface during the treatment process before it can carry out its intended function. An active component is any component for which there is a need and/or requirement to deposit it onto the treated surface, for example, to enhance its performance. The active components are not limited to active components mat are inactive until they are in close proximity to, or deposited onto, the treated surface, A highly preferred active component is<br>
perfume, especially when it is desired to deliver a good dry fabric odour benefit to a fabric during a laundering process.<br>
The perfume can be formulated to provide any olfactory perception that is desired. For example, the perfume can be a light floral fragrance a fruity fragrance or a woody or earthy fragrance. The perfume typically comprises one or more perfume raw materials (PRMs), more typically the perfume comprises numerous PRMs, i.e. at least two, or at least five or even at least ten and typically even more than that, which are typically blended together to obtain a perfume that has the desired odour. The perfume may be of a simple design and comprise only a relatively small number of PRMs, or alternatively the perfume may be of a more complex design and comprise a relatively large number of PRMs. Suitable PRMs are typically selected from the group consisting of aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols, propionates, salicylates, ethers and combinations thereof. Preferred perfumes and PRMs are described in more detail in WO97/11151, especially from page 8, line 18 to page 11, line 25.<br>
The perfume typically has a threshold olfactory detection level, otherwise known as an<br>
odour detection threshold (ODT) of less than or equal to 3ppm, more preferably equal to or less<br>
than lOppb. Typically, the perfume comprises PRMs that have an ODT of less than or equal to<br>
3ppm, more preferably equal to or less than lOppb, Preferred is when the perfume comprises at<br>
least 70wt%, more preferably at least 85wt%, PRMs that have an ODT of less than or equal to<br>
3ppm, more preferably equal to or less than lOppb. A method of calculating ODT is described in<br>
WO97/11151, especially from page 12, line 10 to page 13, line 4.	Typically, the perfume<br>
has a boiling point of less than 300°C. Typically, the perfume comprises at least 50wt%, more preferably at least 75wt%, of PRMs that have a boiling point of less than 300°C. In addition, the perfume typically has an octanol/water partition coefficient (ClogP) value greater than 1.0. A method of calculating ClogP is described in W097/11151, especially from page 11, line 27 to page 12, line 8.<br>
The active component, or at least part thereof, is typically adsorbed and/or absorbed onto the solid support component This is especially preferred when the solid support component is porous and the active component (or if the active component is a perfume, then the PRMs that make up the perfume), or part thereof, can pass through the pores of the porous solid support component and be held within the porous matrix of the solid support component. Active components, especially perfumes, that are adsorbed/absorbed onto the porous solid support component can be tailored in such a way to delay the release of the active component from the solid support component.<br>
One means of tailoring a perfume to be released slowly from a porous material is to ensure that the perfume comprises one or more PRMs that have good affinity for the porous material. For example, PRMs that have a specific size, shape (i.e. a molecular cross-sectional area and molecular volume) and surface area relative to the pores of (he porous material, exhibit improved affinity for the porous material and are capable of preventing other PRMs that have less affinity to the porous material from leaving the porous material during the washing and/or rinsing stage of a laundering process. This is described in more detail in WO97/11152, especially from page 7, line 26 to page 8, line 17.<br>
Another means of tailoring a perfume to be released slowly from a porous material is to ensure that the perfume comprises PRMs that are small enough to pass through the pores of the porous material, and that are capable of reacting together, or with a small non-perfume molecule (otherwise known as a size-enlarging agent) to form a larger molecule (otherwise known as a release inhibitor) that is too large to pass through the pores of the porous material. The release inhibitor, being too large to pass through the pores of the porous material, becomes entrapped within the porous matrix of the porous material until it breaks down (i.e. hydrolyses) and reverts back to the smaller PRM and size enlarging agent, which are then capable of passing through the pores of, and exiting, the porous material. Typically, this is achieved by the formation of hydrolysable bonds between a small PRM and a size-enlarging agent, to form a release inhibitor within the porous material. Upon hydrolysis, the small PRM is released from the larger molecule and is then capable of exiting the porous material. This is described in more detail in WO97/34981, especially from page 7, line 4 to page 5, line 14.<br>
In addition, the above approach of forming a release inhibitor by reacting a PRM with a size-enlarging agent can be further adapted by using a size enlarging agent that has a hydrophilic portion and a hydrophobic portion (e.g. a sugar based non-ionic surfactant such as a lactic acid ester of a Cig monoglyceride). This is described in more detail in WO97/34982, especially from page 6, line 27 to page 7, line 17.<br>
Solid support component<br>
The solid support component is insoluble in water. The solid support component interacts with the active component to provide a support for and to protect the active component during a treatment process such as a laundering process. The solid support component also enhances the deposition of the active component onto a treated surface, e.g. a fabric surface, typically by being deposited onto the treated surface itself and carrying the active component onto the treated surface with it.<br>
The solid support component can be any water-insoluble material that is capable of supporting (e.g. by absorption or adsorption) the active component, whilst, of course, still being able to release the active component at some stage during and/or after the treatment process. Preferred solid support components are porous materials, such that the active component can pass through the pores of the porous solid support component and be held within the porous matrix of the solid support component.<br>
Preferred solid support components are selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, amorphous silicates, calcium carbonates and double salts thereof, clays, chitin micro beads, crystalline non-layered silicates, cyclodextrins and combinations thereof. More preferably, the solid support component is an aluminosilicate, most preferably a zeolite, especially a faujustitc zeolite, such as zeolite X, zeolite Y and combinations thereof. An especially preferred solid support component is zeolite 13x, Preferred aluminosilicates are described in more detail in WO97/11151, especially from page 13, line 26 to page 15, line 2.<br>
It may be preferred for the solid support component to have a crystalline structure and to have an average primary crystal size in the range of from 2 to 80 micrometers, preferably from 2 to 10 micrometers and/or typically no more man 10wt% of the primary crystals have a particle size less man 0.8 micrometers and/or typically no more than 10wt% of the primary crystals have a particle size greater than 20 micrometers. Solid support components having these primary crystal size requirements show good deposition onto the treated surface, show good release dynamics of the active component, show unproved active component loading capability and do not give rise to any cleaning and/or treatment negatives.<br>
Preferably, the outer surface of the solid support component has a negatively charged surface, especially when at neutral pH (i.e. pH 7), Typically, the solid support component comprises an oxide outer surface; i.e. the outer surface of the solid support component comprises oxide moieties. A solid support component having a negatively charged outer surface charge, more readily interacts with the surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer, due to increased electrochemical attraction between the cationic polymer and negatively charged outer surface of the solid support component This is especially preferred when the surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer has a specific charge density and/or a specific degree of cationic substitution, as then there is an optimal affinity between the cationic polymer and the solid support component, which results in improved deposition of the active component onto the treated surface, especially a fabric surface during a laundering process.<br>
polysaccharides, and combinations thereof. Most preferably, the encapsulating material is a starch. Preferred starches are described in EP922499, US4977252, US5354559 and US5935826.<br>
Surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer<br>
The surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer enhances the deposition of the active component, which is usually held within or by the solid support component, onto the surface to be treated. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the cationic polymer, once adsorbed onto the solid support component, diminishes, preferably negates, any repulsion, i.e. electrostatic repulsion, that may occur between the outer surface of the solid support component and the treated surface; this is believed to be especially true when the outer surface of the solid support component is negatively charged and the treated surface is a fabric surface. The surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer typically reduces the zeta potential of the composition.<br>
Surface deposition enhancing cationic polymers having a highly preferred average degree of cationic substitution, more readily interact with the solid support component and further enhance the deposition of the active component onto the treated surface during the treatment process. This is especially true for laundering processes and also when the active component is a perfume. The cationic polymer preferably has an average degree of cationic substitution of from 1% to 70%, preferably from above 20% to 70%, more preferably from 40% to 60%.<br>
The average degree of cationic substitution typically means the molar percentage of monomers in the cationic polymer that are cationically substituted. The average degree of cationic substitution can be determined by any known methods, such as colloid titration. One such colloid titration method is described in more detail by Horn, D., in Prog. Colloid &amp;Polymer Sci., 1978, 8, p243-265.<br>
Whilst it is desirable for the cationic polymer to be able to (i) reduce Hie zeta potential of the composition, (ii) increase the hydrophobicity of the composition and (iii) increase the area of contact between the treated surface and the composition, as this promotes deposition of the solid component and/or active component onto the treated surface, it is also desirable that coacervation and flocculation involving the cationic polymer and other components of the composition and/or soil present in the wash liquor do not occur as this can give rise to cleaning negatives. The ability of the cationic polymer to provide the above benefits whilst avoiding coacervation and flocculation can be controlled by controlling the weight average molecular weight of the cationic polymer and the average degree of cationic substitution of the cationic polymer. It is also desirable that the cationic polymer remains adsorbed on the solid support component during the treatment process as any cationic polymer that does not remain adsorbed on the solid support<br>
component, i.e. cationic polymer that becomes free in the wash liquor, is capable of interacting with components of the composition and/or soil and can cause cleaning negatives.<br>
If the molecular weight of the cationic polymer is too great, then the cationic polymer may promote flocculation and cleaning negatives may be observed. If the molecular weight of the cationic polymer is too small, then the deposition of the active component onto the treated surface is not optimal. Preferred cationic polymers have a weight average molecular weight of from above 100,000 Da. to below 10,000,000 Da., preferably from 500,000 Da. to 2,000,000 Da..<br>
Any known gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement methods for determining the weight average molecular weight of a polymer can be used to measure the weight average molecular weight of the cationic polymer. GPC measurements are described in more detail in Polymer Analysis by Stuart, B. H., pi 08-112, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, UK, © 2002.<br>
A typical GPC method for determining the weight average molecular weight of a polymer is described below:<br>
1.	Dissolve 1.5g of polymer, in 1 litre of deionised water.<br>
2.	Filter the mixture obtained in step 1., using a Sartorius Minisart RC25 filter.<br>
3.	According the manufacturer's instructions, inject 100 Hires of the mixture obtained in step 2.,<br>
on a GPC machine mat is fitted with a Suprema MAX (8mm by 30cm) column operating at 35°C<br>
and aBRC7510 detector, with 0.2M aqueous solution of acetic acid and potassium chloride<br>
solution being used as an elution solvent at a flux of 0.8 ml/min.<br>
4.	The weight average molecular weight is obtained by analysing the data from the GPC<br>
according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Cationic polymers having this preferred weight average molecular weight and preferred average degree of cationic substitution can be used to enhance the deposition of a perfume onto a fabric surface.<br>
The cationic polymer is typically water-soluble and/or water-dispersible, preferably water-soluble. Water-soluble and/or water dispersible cationic polymers, especially water-soluble cationic polymers show a surprising good ability to deposit the active component onto the treated surface.<br>
Preferred cationic polymers comprise (i) acrylamide monomer units, (ii) other cationic monomer units and (iii) optionally, other monomer units. Suitable surface deposition enhancing cationic polymers are cationically modified polyacrylamides or co-polymers thereof; any cationic modification can in theory be used for these polyacrylamides. Highly preferred cationic polymers are co polymers of acrylamide and a methyl chloride quaternary salt of dimethylaminoethyl<br><br>
acrylate (DMA3-MeCl), for example such as those supplied by BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany, under the tradename Sedipur CL343.<br>
The general structure for DMASMeCl is:<br><br>
The general structure of acrylamide is:<br>
Preferred cationic polymers have the following general structure:<br>
wherein n and m independently are numbers in the range of from 100 to 100,000, preferably from 800 to 3400. The molar ratio of n:m is preferably in the range of from 4:1 to 3:7, preferably from 3:2 to 2:3.<br>
Suitable cationic polymers are described in more detail in, and can be synthesized according to the methods described in, DE10027634, DE10027636, DE10027638, US6111056, US6147183, WO98/17762, WO98/21301, W001/05872 and, WO01/05874.<br>
Laundry detergent compositions comprising the detergent auxiliary composition<br>
The detergent auxiliary composition is preferably incorporated in a laundry detergent composition. The laundry detergent composition is used to launder fabrics and provides a good dry fabric odour benefit to the fabric due to the presence of the detergent auxiliary composition in the laundry detergent composition. The laundry detergent composition typically comprises one or more adjunct components. These adjunct components are described in more detail below. The laundry detergent composition may be the product of a spray-dry and/or agglomeration process.<br>
Optional adjunct components<br>
The detergent auxiliary composition and/or the laundry detergent composition may optionally comprise one or more adjunct components. These adjunct components are typically<br>
selected from the group consisting of detersive surfactants, builders, polymeric co-builders, bleach, chelants, enzymes, anti-redeposition polymers, soil-release polymers, polymeric soil-dispersing and/or soil-suspending agents, dye-transfer inhibitors, fabric-integrity agents, brigbteners, suds suppressors, fabric-softeners, flocculants, and combinations thereof. Suitable adjunct components are described in more detail in WO97/11151, especially from page 15, line 31 to page 50, line 4.<br>
Method of making the detergent auxiliary composition<br>
The detergent auxiliary composition is typically obtained by a method comprising the steps of: (i) contacting a water-insoluble solid support component with a liquid or liquefiable active component to form a first mixture; and (ii) contacting the first mixture obtained in step (i) with a surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer to form a second mixture; and (iii) contacting the second mixture obtained in step (ii) with a water-soluble and/or water-dispersible encapsulating material to form a composition; and (iv) optionally, drying the composition, wherein step (ii) occurs subsequent to step (i) and prior to steps (iii) and (iv).<br>
Step (i) of contacting a solid support component with an active component to form a first mixture is typically carried out in a high shear mixer such as a Schuggi mixer or other high shear mixer, for example a CB mixer, although other lower shear mixers, such as a KM mixer, may also be used. Typically, the solid support component is passed through the mixer and the active component is sprayed onto the solid support component If the active component adsorbs or absorbs onto the solid support component, which is the case if the active component is a perfume and the solid support component is a zeolite, then this reaction is typically exothermic and heat is generated during this stage of the process. This of course depends on the active component used and the solid support component used. Furthermore, the build up of heat during this step is more likely to occur when the process is a continuous process (as opposed to a batch process). The generation of heat can be controlled by any suitable heat management means; such as placing water jackets or coils on the mixer or other vessel used in step (i), or by direct cooling, for example by using liquid nitrogen, to remove the heat that is generated, and/or by controlling the flow rate of the active component and/or the solid support component in the mixer or other vessel used in step (i).<br>
Step (ii) of contacting the first mixture obtained in step (i) with a surface deposition enhancing cationic polymer to form a second mixture can occur in any suitable vessel such as a tank. Alternatively, step (ii) can occur in an online mixer. The stirred tank can be a batch<br>
tank or a continuous tank. Typically this step is carried out in an aqueous environment. Typically, the cationic polymer is diluted in water to form an aqueous mixture and to this aqueous mixture is added the first mixture obtained in step (i). The concentration of the cationic polymer in the aqueous mixture is from 0.3g/1 to 50g/l, preferably from 10g/l to 30g/L Cationic polymers being present at these preferred concentrations show optimal adsorption onto the solid support component.<br>
In addition to this, it is also desirable to control the concentration of the solid support component in the aqueous mixture. Preferably, the concentration of the solid support component in the aqueous mixture is from 7g/l to 2,000g/l, preferably from 500g/l to 1,000 g/1. Solid components being present at these preferred concentrations enable an efficient particle production process and efficient uptake of the cationic polymer.<br>
It may also be desirable to control the electrochemistry of the cationic polymer and the solid support component during step (ii) to ensure that they have optimal affinity to each other during this step. One means of controlling the electrochemistry is to control thepH of step (ii). Preferably step (ii) is carried out in an aqueous environment having a pH of from 3 to 9, most preferably from 4 to 7.<br>
The time of step (ii) should typically be sufficient to allow adsorption of the cationic polymer onto the solid support material. Preferably the time of step (ii) is from 5 minutes to 25 minutes, most preferably from 10 minutes to 15 minutes.<br>
Step (iii), of contacting the second mixture obtained in step (ii) with a water-soluble and/or water-dispersible encapsulating material to form a composition, can occur in any suitable vessel such as a stirred tank. Alternatively, step (iii) can occur in an online mixer. The stirred tank can be a batch tank or a continuous tank. It may be preferred to control the temperature of step (iii) especially in order to obtain a composition comprising a high level of active component,<br>
Preferably, step (ii) and/or (iii) is carried out a temperature of less than 50°C, or even less than 20°C. It may be preferred that cooling means such as a water jacket or even liquid nitrogen are used in step (ii) and/or (iii), this is especially typical when it is desirable to carry out step (ii) and/or (iii) at a temperature that is below the ambient temperature. It may also be preferred to limit the energy condition of step (ii) and/or (iii) in order to obtain a composition comprising a high level of active component.<br>
Step (ii) and/or (iii) is preferably done in a low shear mixer, for example a stirred tank. This is especially preferred if the active component is a perfume.<br>
Optional step (iv), of drying the composition of step (iii), can be carried out in any suitable drying equipment such a spray-dryer and/or fluid bed dryer. Typically, the composition<br>
of step (Hi) is forced dried (for example, spray-dried or fluid bed dried) and is not left to dry by evaporation at ambient conditions. Typically, heat is applied during this drying step. Typically, the product of step (iii) is spray-dried. If the active component is volatile, e.g. a perfume, then preferably, the temperature of the drying step is carefully controlled to prevent the active component from vapourising and escaping from the composition obtained in step (iii). Preferably, the composition of step (iii) is spray-dried in a spray-drying tower, and preferably the difference between the inlet air temperature and the outlet air temperature in the spray-drying tower is less than 100°C. This is a smaller temperature difference than is conventionally used, for example hi spray-drying laundry detergent components, but is preferred in order to prevent the unwanted vapourisation of any volatile active component from the composition that was obtained in step (iii). Typically, the inlet air temperature of the spray-drying tower is from 170°C to 220°C, and the outlet air temperature of the spray-drying tower is from 90°C to 110°C. Highly preferred is when the inlet air temperature of the spray-drying tower is from 170°C to 180°C, and the outlet air temperature of the spray-drying tower is from 100°C to 105°C. It is also important drat a good degree of atomisation of the composition obtained in step (iii) is achieved during the spray-drying process, as this ensures that the resultant detergent auxiliary composition has the optimal particle size distribution, having good flowability, solubility, stability and performance. The degree of atomisation can be controlled by carefully controlling the tip speed of the rotary atomiser in the spray-drying tower. Preferably, the rotary atomiser has a tip speed of from 100ms"1 to 500ms"1.<br>
It may be preferred that during its processing and storage thereafter, the composition and any intermediate composition/product that is formed during its processing, is kept in an environment having a low relative humidity. Preferably the air in contact with the composition (or intermediate composition/product thereof) is equal to or lower than, preferably lower than, the equilibrium relative humidity of the composition (or intermediate composition/product thereof). This can be achieved, for example, by placing the composition in air tight containers during storage and/or transport, or by the input of dry and/or conditioned air into the mixing vessels, storage and/or transport containers during the process, transport and/or storage of the composition (or intermediate composition/product thereof).<br>
