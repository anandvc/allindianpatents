APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR UPDATING LOCATION OF<br>
IDLE-MODE MOBILE STATION IN A BROADBAND<br>
WIRELESS ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates generally to a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) com-<br>
munication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for fast processing<br>
downlink traffic that has been generated during a location update procedure in an idle-<br>
mode Mobile Station (MS).<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Provisioning of services with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements at or<br>
above 100Mbps to users is an active study area for a future-generation communication<br>
system called a 4th Generation (4G) communication system. Particularly, active<br>
research is conducted on provisioning of high-speed service by ensuring mobility and<br>
QoS to a BWA communication system such as a Wireless Local Area Network<br>
(WLAN) and a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN). Examples of such<br>
systems are Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16a and IEEE<br>
802.16e systems.<br>
[3]	According to the IEEE 802.16e standards, an idle-mode MS shall update its location,<br>
if any of a plurality of location update conditions are met. The IEEE 802.16e-2005<br>
standard defines four location update conditions: Zone Update, Timer Update, Power<br>
Down Update, and Medium Access Control (MAC) Hash Skip Threshold Update.<br>
[4]	Before describing the location update conditions, it is to be clarified that Downlink<br>
Channel Descriptor (DCD), Uplink Channel Descriptor (UCD), Mobile Paging Ad-<br>
vertisement (MOB_PAG-ADV), Paging Group Identifier (PG-ID), MAC Hash Skip<br>
Threshold, MAC Hash Skip Counter, Deregistration Command (DREG-CMD),<br>
Ranging Request (RNG-REQ), and Ranging Response (RNG-RSP) messages are in<br>
compliance with the IEEE 802.16e- 2005 standard.<br>
[5]	In Zone Update, the MS performs a location update process when it detects a change<br>
in its paging group by comparing a PG-ID stored in the MS with a PG-ID included in a<br>
DCD or MOB_PAG-ADV message broadcast by a preferred BS during a Paging<br>
Listening Interval (PLI) known to the MS. If the two PG-IDs are different, the MS<br>
determines that its paging group has been changed.<br>
[6]	In Timer Update, the MS periodically performs the location update process prior to<br>
the expiration of an idle-mode timer. The idle-mode timer is set to 128 to 65536<br>
seconds as defined in IEEE 802.16e-2005 Parameters and Constants.<br><br>
[7]	In Power Down Update, the MS attempts a location update as part of its orderly<br>
power-down procedure. As the MS informs its power-down to a paging controller<br>
being a network entity that handles the idle mode of the MS, the paging controller<br>
deletes information about the MS.<br>
[8]	In MAC Hash Skip Threshold Update, the MS performs the location update process<br>
if an MS MAC Hash Skip Counter exceeds a MAC Hash Skip Threshold. The MAC<br>
Hash Skip Threshold is known from a DREG-CMD message that the MS receives<br>
from a network in order to enter the idle mode. When the location update is successful,<br>
the MS and the BS need to initialize their MAC Hash Skip Counters.<br>
[9]	A description will be made of FIG. 1, which is a flowchart illustrating a conventional<br>
location update process when a prefeixed BS is changed within the same paging group.<br>
[10]	Referring to FIG. 1, a first BS 110 and a second BS 120 are in the same paging<br>
group. When the first BS 110 is a preferred BS, an MS 100 monitors occurrence of a<br>
location update event in idle mode in step 130. Upon occurrence of a location update<br>
event, the MS 100 updates its location with the first BS 110 in step 132 and proceeds<br>
to step 134. If a location update event does not occur in step 130, the MS 100 jumps to<br>
step 134. The MS receives a MOB_PAG-ADV message from the first BS 110 during a<br>
PLI in step 134. Steps 136 to 140 are the same as steps 130 to 134 except that the<br>
preferred BS has changed to the second BS 120.<br>
[11]	As illustrated in FIG. 1, in the case where the preferred BS changes from the first BS<br>
110 to the second BS 120, an analysis of the occurrence of a location update event in<br>
step 136 reveals that the two BSs 110 and 120 are in the same paging group. Hence the<br>
MS jumps from step 136 to step 140 without a location update.<br>
[12]	FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for a conventional Zone Update process.<br>
[13]	Referring to FIG. 2, when detecting a change in its paging group, the MS 100<br>
transmits an initial/dedicated ranging Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Code<br>
(M20) to a preferred BS, herein the BS: 120, according to valid DCD and UCD in-<br>
formation received from the BS 120.<br>
[14]	The BS 120 transmits Uplink BandWidth (UL BW) allocation information to the MS<br>
100 by a RNG-RSP message with status=success (M21) and a CDMA-Allocation-IE<br>
message (M22) so that the MS 100 can transmit an uplink message.<br>
[15]	The MS 100 transmits a RNG-REQ message with ranging purpose=0x02 (M23)<br>
according to the UL BW allocation information. That is, the MS 100 sets Value of a<br>
Ranging Purpose Indication Type, Length, Value (TLV) to indicate a location update<br>
request.<br>
[16]	The BS 120 replies with an RNG-RSP message with location update response (M24),<br>
i.e. including a Location Update Response (LUR) TLV indicating success. The BS 120<br>
may include paging information such as a new paging cycle, a new paging offset, and a<br><br>
new PG-ID in the RNG-RSP message (M24).<br>
[17]	Upon receipt of the RNG-RSP message (M24), the MS 100 determines whether the<br>
location update is successful in step 202. If the location update is successful, the MS<br>
100 completes the location update process in step 204. If the location update has failed,<br>
the MS performs initial network entry in step 206.<br>
[18]	FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for a conventional process for<br>
processing pending downlink traffic during the Zone Update. Steps or messages<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 1 and 2 will not be described herein.<br>
[19]	Referring to FIG. 3, when detecting the change of the preferred BS from a first BS<br>
310 to a second BS 320 in a different paging group in an idle mode, the MS 100 and<br>
the second BS 320 exchange M20 to M24 messages as illustrated in FIG. 2. Upon<br>
receipt of a RNG-RSP message (M24), the MS completes the location update in step<br>
336.<br>
[20]	Upon receipt of the RNG-RSP message (M24), the MS 100 also monitors a valid PLI<br>
from the second BS 320 using new paging information included in the RNG-RSP<br>
message (M24). Hence, the MS 100 can receive a MOB_PAG-ADV message (M30)<br>
indicating occurrence of downlink traffic in the valid PLI.<br>
[21]	When detecting the presence of the downlink traffic, the MS releases itself from the<br>
idle mode and performs network reentry in step 338.<br>
[22]	If the first BS 310 or second 320 receives downlink traffic for the MS 100 but does<br>
not transmit the downlink traffic, i.e. leaves the downlink traffic pending during the<br>
time period between step 332 and transmission of the RNG-RSP message (M24) from<br>
the second BS 320, the MS 100 does not reenter the network until it is aware of the<br>
occurrence of the downlink traffic by the MOB_PAG-ADV message (M30), despite<br>
the completion of the location update by the time of receiving the RNG-RSP message<br>
(M24).<br>
[23]	A shortcoming with the above conventional location update process is that the MS<br>
does not know whether downlink traffic exists for the MS even after a successful<br>
location update. The MS knows the occurrence of the downlink traffic only when an<br>
updated PLI comes.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[40]	Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawmgs. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
[41]	The present invention provides an apparatus and method for updating the location of<br>
an idle-mode MS so as to reduce the delay of downlink traffic directed to the MS, in<br>
particular to overcome the problem encountered with the present IEEE 802.16e<br>
standard in that an MS is not aware of the presence of downlink traffic until an updated<br>
PLI, in a BWA communication system.<br>
[42]	FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a signal flow for a process for processing pending<br>
downlink traffic during a Zone Update in a BWA communication system according to<br>
the present invention. A description of steps or messages described earlier with<br>
reference to FIGs. 1, 2 and 3 is not provided herein.<br>
[43]	Referring to FIG. 4, when an MS 400 detects in an idle mode that a preferred BS has<br>
changed from a first BS 410 to a second BS 420 in a different paging group in step<br>
432, it transmits an initial/dedicated ranging CDMA Code (M20) to the second BS<br>
420. The BS 420 transmits a RNG-RSP message (M21) and a CDMA-Allocation-IE<br>
message (M22) to the MS 400. Then the MS 400 transmits a RNG-REQ message<br>
(M23) to the second BS 420.<br>
[44]	Detennining that there is downlink traffic pending for the MS 400 in step 434, the<br>
second BS 420 transmits a RNG-RSP message (M40) to the MS 400. The RNG-RSP<br>
message (M40) contains new paging information and information indicating the<br>
presence of the downlink traffic.<br>
[45]	As the MS 400 is aware of the pending downlink traffic by the RNG-RSP message<br>
(M40), it completes the location update process and performs network reentry from the<br>
idle mode in step 436.<br>
[46]	The RNG-RSP message (M40) includes an LUR TLV configured as shown in Table<br>
1 below.<br>
[47]	Table 1<br><br><br>
[48]	In Table 1, the TLV values other than a Value of 0x02 are in compliance with the<br>
IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard.<br>
[49]	FIG. 5 is a block diagram of a BS in the BWA communication system according to<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, the BS includes a controller 500, an<br>
interface module 502, a RNG-REQ processor 504, a RNG-RSP processor 506, and a<br>
downlink traffic processor 508.<br>
[50]	The interface module 502 is a module for communicating with an MS, including a<br>
Radio Frequency (RF) processor and a baseband processor. The RF processor<br>
downconverts an RF signal received through an antenna to a baseband signal and<br>
provides the baseband signal to the baseband processor. It also upconverts a baseband<br>
signal received from the baseband processor to an RF signal transmittable over air and<br>
transmits the RF signal through the antenna. In BWA, for example, the baseband<br>
processor processes an RF signal received from the RF processor by Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (FFT) and channel decoding and provides the original information data to<br>
the controller 500. In the reverse order, the baseband processor processes data received<br>
from the controller 500 by channel encoding and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform<br>
(IFFT) and provides the processed data to the RF processor.<br>
[51]	The RNG-REQ processor 504 processes a RNG-REQ message (M23) received from<br>
the idle-mode MS 400. It identifies whether the ranging purpose of the RNG-REQ<br>
message (M23) is location update, initial ranging, or network entry and operates corre-<br>
spondingly. If the RNG-REQ message (M23) includes the ID of the MS 400 and<br>
Ranging Purpose Indication Bit#1=1, the RNG-REQ processor 504 considers that the<br>
RNG-REQ message (M23) requests a location update.<br>
[52]	The downlink traffic processor 508 operates after the location update requested by<br>
the MS 400 is performed. If the location update is successful, the downlink traffic<br>
processor 508 monitors generation of downlink traffic for the MS 400 and provides the<br><br>
monitoring result to the RNG-RSP processor 506.<br>
[53]	The RNG-RSP processor 506 generates a RNG-RSP message (M40) with an LUR<br>
TLV parameter configured as shown in Table 1 according to whether the location<br>
update is successful and there is pending downlink traffic.<br>
[54]	The controller 500 controls the interface module 502, the RNG-REQ processor 504,<br>
the RNG-RSP processor 506, and the downlink traffic processor 508. That is, the<br>
controller 500 can implement the functionalities of the interface module 502, the RNG-<br>
REQ processor 504, the RNG-RSP processor 506, and the downlink traffic processor<br>
508. While the interface module 502, the RNG-REQ processor 504, the RNG-RSP<br>
processor 506, and the downlink traffic processor 508 are shown separately for il-<br>
lustrative purposes, all or part of them may be incorporated into the controller 500 in<br>
real implementation.<br>
[55]	FIG. 6 is a block diagram of an MS in the BWA communication system according to<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, the MS includes a controller 600, an<br>
interface module 602, a RNG-REQ processor 604, a RNG-RSP processor 606, a<br>
location update processor 608, and a network reentry processor 610.<br>
[56]	The interface module 602 is a modulle for communicating with the BS, including an<br>
RF processor and a baseband processor. The RF processor downconverts an RF signal<br>
received through an antenna to a baseband signal and provides the baseband signal to<br>
the baseband processor. It also upconverts a baseband signal received from the<br>
baseband processor to an RF signal transmittable over air and transmits the RF signal<br>
through the antenna. In BWA, for example, the baseband processor processes an RF<br>
signal received from the RF processor by FFT and channel decoding and provides the<br>
original information data to the controller 600. In the reverse order, the baseband<br>
processor processes data received from the controller 600 by channel encoding and<br>
IFFT and provides the processed data to the RF processor.<br>
[57]	The RNG-REQ processor 604 generates a RNG-REQ message (M23) for a location<br>
update when any of location update conditions is met in an idle mode. The RNG-REQ<br>
message (M23), whose ranging purpose is location update includes the ID of the MS<br>
(herein, the MS 400) and Ranging Purpose Indication Bit#1=1.<br>
[58]	The RNG-RSP processor 606 processes a RNG-RSP message (M40) received from<br>
the BS 420 to update the location of the MS 400. The RNG-RSP processor 606<br>
provides location update information according to an LUR TLV value to the location<br>
update processor 608 and informs the network reentry processor 610 whemer there is<br>
pending downlink traffic according to the LUR TLV value. Herein, the location update<br>
information can be new paging information with a new paging cycle, a new paging<br>
offset, and a new PG-ID.<br>
[59]	The location update processor 608 updates a PLI using the new paging cycle and the<br><br>
new paging offset, and stores the new PG-ID.<br>
[60]	The network reentry processor 610 attempts network reentry to the BS 420, being the<br>
preferred BS, when the RNG-RSP processor 606 indicates that there is pending<br>
downlink traffic.<br>
[61]	The controller 600 controls the interface module 602, the RNG-REQ processor 604,<br>
the RNG-RSP processor 606, the location update processor 608, and the network<br>
reentry processor 610. That is, the controller 600 can implement the functionalities of<br>
the interface module 602, the RNG-REQ processor 604, the RNG-RSP processor 606,<br>
the location update processor 608, and the network reentry processor 610. While the<br>
