				<td>-1A-<br>
The present invention relates to a gear case unit as a mechanical speed reduction unit, i.e., to a mechanical device for transmitting power constituted by coupled mechanical elements, for example shafts and gears, which is interposed between a motor, which is generally electric, and any user device to be driven at a reduced speed, or even at a higher speed, assuming more appropriately the name' of "step-up or overgear unit" in the latter case; in any case, the moving mechanical elements, which constitute the reduction or step-up unit, are enclosed in a casing which rotationally supports at least the drive shaft and the driven shaft in mutual alignment or even the drive shaft arranged off-axis with respect to the driven shaft.<br>
The state of the art comprises mechanical speed reduction and step-up units, hereinafter briefly referenced to as "reduction units", whose casing can be provided with:<br>
— a mounting surface which is parallel to the axis of<br>
the shaft (or shafts) and is constituted by a continuous or<br>
discontinuous base provided with holes for the passage of<br>
corresponding screws or bolts (version generally known as<br>
B3, as shown in figures 1 and 2);<br>
— a wall mounting surface which lies normal to the<br>
shaft axis and is constituted by a monolithic flange, with<br>
holes for the passage of corresponding screws or bolts<br>
inserted from the motor side or from the opposite side<br>
(monolithic version B5, as shown in figures 3 and 4);<br>
-	a wall mounting surface which lies normal to the<br>
shaft axis and is constituted by a peripherally continuous<br>
or discontinuous flange with threaded holes for screwing<br><br>
2<br>
therein screws which can be operated on from the opposite side with respect to the motor side (version B14, as shown in figures 5 and 6);<br>
— a continuous or discontinuous base mounting surface<br>
and a mounting surface which lies normal to the axis with a<br>
continuous or discontinuous flange provided with threaded<br>
holes (version B3/B14, as shown in figures 7 and 8);<br>
— a mounting surface which lies normal to the axis and<br>
is constituted by an applied flange provided with through<br>
holes (add-on version B5 as shown in figures 9 and 10);<br>
— a continuous or discontinuous base mounting surface<br>
and a mounting surface which lies normal to the axis on an<br>
applied flange with through holes (add-on version B3/B5, as<br>
shown in figures 11 and 12).<br>
This state of the art, however, entails considerable drawbacks caused by the fact that a single reduction unit provided with one or two mounting surfaces as mentioned above cannot meet a plurality of different requirements for mounting it along surfaces which lie parallel or normal to the axis.<br>
Accordingly, versions which allow a single kind of mounting (B3, B5) force one to purchase two different reduction units, whilst versions which allow two kinds of mounting, respectively (B3/B14) and (add-on B3/B5), are not satisfactory, since for example for type B3/B14 wall mounting requires accessibility of said wall on the opposite side with respect to the motor side, and this is often impossible and in any case more complicated, whilst for the add-on B3/B5 type it is necessary to assemble an additional flange.<br><br>
3<br>
Moreover, amidst the complexity of systems, it often happens that the reduction unit, in addition to the need to be mounted to a lower or wall support, must also be mounted to an upper support; since the reduction unit is not preset therefor, it would have to be turned upside down, with the consequent need to provide special lubrication means.<br>
Finally, the reduction unit axis may sometimes have to assume different distances from the supporting surface: however, since this is not immediately feasible, it is necessary to provide for specific corrective structures.<br>
It is understood that reduction units can also be coupled in vertical or otherwise inclined arrangements.<br>
This prior state of the art is susceptible of considerable improvements as regards the possibility to eliminate the above drawbacks.<br>
The above description first of all clearly shows the need to solve the technical problem of finding a reduction unit which can be coupled to any electric or non-electric motor and can meet new installation requirements for coupling to supporting surfaces, i.e., immediate adaptability for mounting to an upper support, and advantageously simultaneously meets at least two of the following requirements:<br>
— mounting on an upper support;<br>
— mounting on a front wall;<br>
— mounting on a lower support;<br>
as regards adaptability for simultaneous mounting on lower and upper supports, since it is necessary to meet the most disparate overall size requirements according to the kind of<br><br>
4<br>
motor associated with the reduction unit and according to the space available in the supporting structure, another aspect of the same problem is to mount the reduction unxt on a surface, for example an upper surface, despite the presence of the terminal strip which protrudes from the electric motor on the same side or of protrusions, in general, of other kinds of motors.<br>
The invention solves the above problem by adopting, in the reduction unit, an additional mounting surface which is parallel to the axis and is advantageously arranged above it, and as regards achieving an increase in the installation possibilities, by adopting, in the reduction unit, at least one front mounting surface and another mounting surface which is parallel and opposite to the upper one; as regards the application of the mounting surface, for example on the terminal strip side, by adopting between the two upper and lower mounting surfaces a different distribution of their distances with respect to the axis, the greatest of said distances being, in the specific case, located on the side of said terminal strip.<br>
The advantages achieved by the present invention are: as regards the adoption of an additional mounting surface which is parallel to the axis, advantageously in opposition with respect to the conventional one, the possibility to immediately choose between lower mounting and upper mounting, both with equal distances between the two mounting surfaces and the axis and with different distances; said axis being able to assume the smallest or greatest of the distances from the mounting surface of the reduction unit-user machine assembly; as regards the adoption of the front<br><br>
5<br>
mounting surface, the possibility, together with provisions for mounting along at least one surface which is parallel to the axis, to allow insertion of the mounting means both from the motor side and from the other side; another advantage being constituted by the possibility to neutralize the bulk of the terminal strip of the electric motor (or other equivalent protrusion of a non-electric motor) to mount the reduction unit on the same side; this by arranging the coupling of the reduction unit which has the greatest distance between the mounting surface and the axis on the same side as said terminal strip or protrusion.<br>
Some embodiments of the invention are illustrated,<br>
accompanying merely by way of example, in the/              drawings,<br>
