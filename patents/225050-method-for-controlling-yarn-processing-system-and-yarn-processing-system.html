METHOD FOR CONTROLLING YARN PROCESSING SYSTEM AND<br>
YARN PROCESSING SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a method according to the preamble part of claim 1 and to a yarn processing system according to the preamble part of claim 5.<br>
During operation of a yarn processing system a lively communication takes place among many components and the main control unit.   During the communication not only operational information of the textile machine is transmitted but also, in some cases, confirmations are transmitted and functions are initiated at or via components.   Due to the volume of the data which is to be transmitted, the communication bus system and/or the main control unit of the textile machine may be overwhelmed in case of certain operation conditions.   In such cases a data jam occurs or important data is not transmitted sufficiently rapidly.   Signals of the sensor monitoring yarn movements and/or yarn breakages (OK signs and/or fault signals) are time critical for the correct course of the operation or for power downs or for correction measures which are to be initiated rapidly.   For this reason it is known to connect each sensor via a separate signal transmission line to the main control unit which main control unit needs to have a complex design in order to be able to identify and to allocate the signals.   Furthermore, the main control unit has to evaluate and process the received signals while the main control unit in some cases at the same time is communicating with other components of the yarn processing system.  A complex layout of the main control unit is costly and may constitute a source for system disturbances or delays.<br>
It is known from Internet information "TE 400 Cmatic" of the company Nuova Roj Electrotex, Biella, Italy, to connect a weft yarn multi-detector for rapier weaving machines, which multi-detector is controlled by a microcontroller, to the CAN-bus system provided in the yarn processing system and to use the CAN-bus system to control the sensor in order to permanently optimise the response sensitivity.  This control method comprises the variation of the response sensitivity, the activation and the de-activation of the sensor and the sourcing of data while monitoring the response sensitivity.   The adjustment of the arrival of the weft yarn can be optimised automatically for each yarn quality by the optimisation of the response sensitivity of the sensor without the necessity of interference by operating personnel.   Operation information of the weaving machine is transmitted in a CAN-bus<br><br>
system, e.g. the termination of each insertion, in order to then automatically carry out an adjustment of the response sensitivity of the sensor.  An optimal adjustment then will be achieved after several insertion cycles.   The output signal of the sensor which in some cases is monitoring several running weft yarns at the same time, is varying and is evaluated in the main control unit of the textile machine.   In the case that upon evaluation of the output signal a determination is made that the output signal is relevant with respect to a measure for a power down of the system and/or a correction in the system the main the control unit initiates the respective necessary measure.   Either the yarn processing system is switched off totally or, e.g. in case of a yarn breakage in one yarn channel the task of the additional yarn feeding function is transferred to another functioning yarn channel without switching the textile machine off.   This means that the main control unit is evaluating the signals while the main control unit as well may have to communicate at the same time with other components of the yarn processing system.<br>
It is an object of the invention to improve a method and a yarn processing system of the type as mentioned above such that the main control unit of the textile machine is relieved and such that operation disturbances caused by an excessive data flood are minimised. This object is to be achieved equally for yarn processing systems comprising as the yarn consuming textile machine either a weaving machine or a knitting machine.<br>
This object is achieved according to the method by the features of claim 1 and according to the device by the features of claim 5, respectively.<br>
â€¢ According to the method the main control unit of the textile machine is relieved because the evaluation of the signals of the sensors does not have to be carried out any longer in the main control unit since this task is delegated to the selected sub-control unit.   This means that the main control unit only seldom will receive signals which have been evaluated as being relevant which signals then can be processed immediately for initiating a measure for either switching the system off and/or initiating a correction measure in the system.<br>
%A selected sub-control unit within the yarn processing system is equipped with an evaluation circuit.   The selected sub-control unit has the task of evaluating the signals of the sensors and of transmitting only the relevant evaluated signals to the main control unit and of taking care that signals representing the normal operation cannot reach the main<br><br>
control unit.   In order to make the sub-control unit capable of carrying out the evaluation the sub-control unit receives or holds the information from the transmitter which information allow the judgement of the signals within the course of the operation of the yarn processing system.   Expediently, a sub-control unit is selected which anyhow is already supplied for other reasons with operation information of the textile machine and which expediently uses this information to also evaluate the signals of the sensor   In this fashion the communication volume in the region of the main control unit and with signals of the sensors is restricted to a necessary minimum only.   The main control unit is relieved.<br>
As not each signal of the sensor is transmitted to the main control unit but only signals which have been evaluated as being relevant, the communication bus system can be used without overloading problems for the transmission of each signal which has been evaluated as being relevant.<br>
Alternatively, e.g. in a complex yarn processing system comprising a plurality of communicating components, a signal which has been evaluated as being relevant may be transmitted via a separate event line to the main control unit.   The communication bus system then is used in order to provide information on the importance and on the sender for the main control unit already prior to the actual relevant signal transmission which relevant signal then will be transmitted via the event line such that the main control unit is enabled to react accordingly.   In this case the signal which has been evaluated as being relevant does not load the other communication of the main control unit as it is transmitted separately via the event line.<br>
Expediently, signals which have been evaluated as not being relevant are already abolished by the sub-control unit and are not transmitted further to the main control unit in cases in which such signals do not need any measures in the system.<br>
The main control unit itself may be the information centre for the sub-control unit within the yarn processing system.   The sub-control unit receives all information from the main control unit which information is needed by the sub-control unit for the evaluation of the signals of the sensor.   This information is related e.g. to the rotary angle of the main shaft of the textile machine and/or to the weaving pattern.<br><br>
Expediently, the yam processing system comprises several yam channels.   In this case the selected sub-control unit will carry out the signal evaluation for all yarn channels centrally and separated from the main control unit.<br>
Alternatively, the information centre may be an information memory which is provided with the information which is needed by the sub-control unit for the evaluation.   Preferably, a programmable or actualisable information memory is provided which either is integrated into the sub-control unit or which is in data transmitting connection with the sub-control unit.<br>
Since a signal which has been evaluated as being relevant has to be transmitted to the main control unit relatively seldom, even the communication bus system itself may be used for the signal transmission which communication bus system per se also transmits operation information of the textile machine to all connected components.   In this fashion separate signal transmission lines can be saved.   The communication bus system transmits a signal which has been evaluated as being relevant in the form of a complete message which then is read out by the main control unit and which then is considered accordingly.<br>
Alternatively, the sub-control unit may be connected to the main control unit in parallel via an event line and the communication bus system.  The respective signal which is evaluated as being relevant is transmitted on the event line to the main control unit.   Prior to the transmission the signal is identified via the communication bus system for the main control unit such that the main control unit will be precisely informed of the importance and the sender of the signal which has been evaluated as being relevant, and which measure then has to be initiated.   The identification e.g. may be made such that the communication bus system defines a time window or a rotary angle window within which an arriving signal has to be a signal from the sensor which signal has been evaluated as being relevant.<br>
Expediently, the communication bus system is a CAN-bus system operating with a protocol within which different messages are allocated different priorities such that signals which are particularly time critical are transmitted in the format of messages of highest priority and very rapidly, e.g. serially, e.g. with a maximum delay of e.g. 300 ps.<br><br>
In order to further relieve the communication bus system a separate textile machine rotary angle bus line may be provided at least between the main control unit and the selected sub-control unit. The sub-control unit may use the rotary angle information transmitted on this bus line for the evaluation of the signals of the sensor. Normally, the rotary angle signals are anyhow transmitted via the bus line to several components within the yarn processing system and also may be used by the sub-control unit for the evaluation of the signals of the sensor<br>
A further important aspect is to transmit weaving pattern information in the form of messages via the communication bus system at least to the sub-control unit which has to carry out the evaluation of the signals of the sensor.   The textile machine is a weaving machine.   The weaving pattern information may be used for the evaluation alternatively or in addition to the rotary angle information.  As the communication bus system is relieved for the main control unit by delegating the task of the evaluation of the signals to the sub-control unit the communication system e.g. can be used for controlling the sensor, i.e. to activate or de-activate the sensor or to adjust the response sensitivity of the sensor or to monitor the response sensitivity.    These messages are emitted by the main control unit which is connected to the control panel of the textile machine, where, furthermore, the necessary adjustments can be carried out or may be programmed.  Alternatively it is possible to hand over the task of the sensor control also to the sub-control unit, meaning that then the necessary adjustment assemblies and monitoring assemblies or indication devices have to be provided at the sub-control unit.<br>
Expediently, the sensor is a weft yarn detector which commonly is associated with several yarn channels.   The sensor may have several single, preferably, piezo-electric sensors. The yarn channels e.g. may be associated with a weaving machine.<br>
Normally, the yarn processing system comprises several sub-control units for different components which sub-control units are separated from the main control unit.   Each sub-control unit a priori is equipped with sufficient intelligence for the evaluation of the signals, e.g. with an evaluation circuit.  Any one of these sub-control units may be selected for the task of evaluating the signals and of transmitting only signals to the main control unit which signals have been evaluated as being relevant.   Expediently, a sub-control unit is selected which is arranged in the yarn processing system at a suitable position, e.g. at the<br><br>
downstream side of the feeding device and/or which has per se to carry out only a few functions such that the task of the evaluation of the signals and the transmission of the signals which have been evaluated as being relevant do not mean an overload for the selected sub-control unit.<br>
Embodiments of the subject of the invention will be explained with the help of the drawings: In the drawings is:<br>
Fig. 1 in schematic illustration a yarn processing system comprising basic components, and illustrating two alternatives of signal transmissions,<br>
Fig. 2 a detail of a further embodiment of a yarn processing system, and<br>
Fig. 3 a schematic illustration of a complex yarn processing system the textile machine of which is a weaving machine.<br>
A textile machine M (a weaving machine) in Fig. 1 is equipped with a main control unit CU receiving operation information via a line 5 e.g. of the rotary angle of a main shaft.   The main control unit CU may comprise a control part CP or may be connected to the control part CP where weaving pattern information is stored or provided, respectively.   Weft yarns Y are supplied by feeding devices 7 into the textile machine M, e.g. in three yarn channels A, B, C (only one feeding device 7 is shown).   Each feeding device 7 pulls the weft yarn Y from a storage bobbin 8, stores the weft yarn intermediately, and allows that a not shown insertion system of the textile machine M inserts the weft yarn intermittently and depending on the weaving pattern.  Along the yam channel, in some cases even at the storage bobbin 8, function components of the yarn processing system S are provided which are not shown in detail, e.g. a sensor 6 which is a so-called weft yarn detector and contains several single sensors 1, 2, 3 for the yam channels A, B, C.   The single sensors 1, 2, 3 e.g. may be piezo-electric sensors.   During operation the yarn processing system sensor 6 monitors at each weft yam Y the yam movement and/or registers a yam breakage.   The sensor 6 emits electric signals representing the yam conditions.   This is known technology.<br>
The feeding device 7 has its own sub-control unit CUS controlling the drive of the feeding device 7 by means of other signals of not shown yarn sensors or the like.   This is known<br><br>
technique.   In this case the sub-control unit CUS is equipped with an evaluation circuit EV which may be provided in hardware form or in software form, respectively.<br>
The yarn processing system contains a rapid communication bus system 9 e.g. a CAN-bus system, to which different components of the yarn processing system S are connected for communication purposes.   It is illustrated that the main control unit CU is communicating with the sub-control unit CUS via corresponding interface processors 10.  The communication bus system 9 e.g. is transmitting operation information Dw and DP of the textile machine to the connected components.   The information Dw e.g. is the rotary angle information from the main shaft of the textile machine, while the information DP is a weaving pattern information, e.g. from the control part CP.<br>
Sensor 6 is connected to the sub-control unit CUS and e.g. is transmitting a signal h of the weft yarn Y in the single sensor 1.  With the help of the textile machine information Dw and/or DP the sub-control unit CUS evaluates the signal i1t and in particular with a view to the relevance of a needed measure to switch off the system and/or to carry out a correction in the system, which measure is initiated and/or carried out by the main control unit CU.   In case that it is determined during the evaluation that the signal ii (a fault signal or an OK signal which is not allowable during this phase of the operation) is relevant for such a measure, then the sub-control unit CUS immediately will transmit a signal iR1 evaluated as being relevant via the communication bus system 9 of the main control unit CU.   Then the main control unit CU will initiate a corresponding measure.   If the signal ii e.g. represents a yarn breakage then the main control unit CU either switches off the textile machine and/or the yarn processing system, or switches over to another yarn channel B or C in order to then insert a weft yarn instead of the broken weft yarn via another yarn channel.   If it is determined during the evaluation in the sub-control unit CUS that the signal h (a fault signal which is correct for this phase of the operation, or an expected OK signal) is not relevant i.e. does not need to initiate a counter measure, the signal is abolished and is not transmitted to the main control unit CU.<br>
An alternative of the signal transmission is indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 1, where, in particular, an event line 11 extends at least from the sub-control unit CUS to the main control unit CU.   Each signal iR evaluated as being relevant is transmitted via the event line 11.   In order to inform the main control unit CU which meaning or importance and/or which<br><br>
sender the signal iR arriving on the event line 11 has (in some cases even further components of the yarn processing system S may be connected to the same event line for transmitting other signals), the communication bus system 9 is identifying the relevant signal iR in advance as originating from the sensor 6, e.g. by means of a message id, which e.g. defines that each signal arriving via the event line within a selected time window or rotary angle window is a signal evaluated as being relevant from the sensor 6 which signal needs to initiate a corresponding counter measure in the system.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an alternative embodiment.   The sensor 6 is co-operating with a sub-control unit CUs-   The sensor 6 transmits signals, e.g. the signal ii to the sub-control unit CUS.   The sub-control unit CUS comprises an evaluation circuit EV and e.g. is connected via the interface processor 10 to the communication bus system 9 via which (as in Fig. 1) textile machine operation information is offered which is necessary for the evaluation.   In this fashion the sub-control unit CUS is able to communicate via the communication bus system with the main control unit CU (similar to Fig. 1) in order to then transmit the respective signal iR1 evaluated as being relevant to the main control unit CU.<br>
The event line 11 is indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 2 as an alternative for the signal transmission.   The sub-control unit CUS transmits a signal iR evaluated as being relevant via the event line to the main control unit CU.   In advance the identification message id is transmitted in the communication bus system 9 to the main control unit CU, e.g. initiated by the sub-control unit CUS in order to inform the main control unit CU accordingly which meaning or importance and/or which sender the signal iR will have.   So to speak, the main control CU then combines the signal iR with the identification id in order to read out the signal iR1 evaluated as being relevant (for transmission of other signals even further components may be connected to the event line 11 as well).<br>
A dash-dotted line 5 is shown as a further alternative in Fig. 2.   The rotary angle information Dw is transmitted via the line 5 to the sub-control unit CUS.   The rotary angle information e.g. is transmitted by the main control unit CU.   The sub-control unit CUS then carries out the evaluation of the signal ii or of the corresponding signals also from the other single sensors 2, 3 (with the help of the rotary angle information Dw).   Line 5 may be extended further also to other components of the yarn processing system.<br><br>
An information transmitter (block symbol Dw-) is shown in Fig. 2 as a further alternative. The information transmitter is either integrated into the sub-control unit CUS or is connected to the sub-control unit CUS, respectively.   The information transmitter provides the textile machine operation information, e.g. Dw, which is needed for the evaluation.   The transmitter may be a memory device, which either is programmable or adjustable.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a complex yarn processing systems the core of which is a not shown weaving machine having a main control unit CU.   Several yarn channels A to C exist, and a sensor 6 is common to all yarn channels in the form of a weft yarn detector comprising several single sensors.   Each yarn channel may comprise a quality sensor 25 upstream of at least one storage bobbin 8, a yarn oiler 23, a feeding device 7, including a sub-control unit CUs, a controlled yarn brake 22, a controlled yarn tensioner 21, a tensiometer 19, and an individual weft yam detector 17 upstream of the sensor 6.   These components are shown in Fig. 3 in a heading field enlarged and in rectangular blocks.   The reference number of the component is associated with each block by an apostrophe.   Additionally, further components could be: a weft yarn breakage detector 24 upstream of the respective feeding device 7, or a pressurised air cleaning device 20, or a yarn controlling component 18.   The components are connected for a communication via a line 16 to the sub-control unit CUS.   In this case the line 16 combines sections of the communication bus system 9 and of the event line 11.   The sub-control unit CUS of the yarn feeding device 7 is selected as the selected control unit for the evaluation e.g. of the signals of the sensor 6 or of the individual sensor 17 with respect to the relevance of the signals for measures which are to be initiated in order to switch off the system and/or to carry out corrections in the system. The sub-control unit CUS is equipped with the evaluation circuit EV. Each feeding device 7 has a sub-control CU' which, in some cases, also may be equipped with an evaluation circuit EV.   The selected sub-control unit CUS evaluates the signals for all sensors of the yarn processing system and also fulfils the task of transmitting signals evaluated as being relevant to the main control unit CU.   However, any other sub-control unit CU* could fulfil this task instead.<br>
The sub-control unit CUs is connected to a feeding device control box 12 which is connected via branches 14, 15 to the main control unit CU.   The branch 14 combines the communication bus system 9, the line 5 serving to transmit rotary angle information, and the event line 11.   The branch 15 is a power supply branch which is extended further at 15' to<br><br>
the sensor 6.   Furthermore, a control box 13 of the storage bobbin system comprising the storage bobbins 8 is connected to the box 12.   In this sub-system further, not specified sensors, e.g. sensors 26, could be provided which also may communicate with the sub-control unit CUs and/or with the main control unit CU.  A branch extending between the control box 12 and at least the sub-control units CUS comprises the communication bus system 9, the event line 11, the line 5 serving to transmit the rotary angle information Dw and a line 15 for supplying power.   The respective components of the yarn processing system S communicate with each other provided that they are equipped with corresponding processor units and control units and communicate, if necessary, also with the main control unit CU.<br>
The evaluation of the signals of the sensor 6 and/or of the individual sensor 17 with a view to the relevance for measures which have to be initiated is carried out in the at least one selected sub-control unit CUS.   Only signals evaluated as being relevant are transmitted to the main control unit CU, in particular either via the communication bus system 9 or via the event line 11.   When the signals are transmitted via the event line 11 the identification of the signal which is to be transmitted via the event line 11 is carried out via the communication bus system in the main control unit CU.  Since only a signal evaluated as being relevant is transmitted to the main control unit CU, and if a counter measure (switching off or correction in the system) has to be initiated, while the main control unit CU is not responsible for the signal evaluation, and since signals evaluated as not being relevant already may be abolished in the sub-control unit CUs, the main control unit CU and also the communication bus system 9 are relieved with respect to these tasks, such that a communication needed for the operation of the yarn processing system S is facilitated.<br><br><br>
