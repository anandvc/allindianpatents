				<td>This invention relates to an improved process of manufacturing ethanol from Glucose.<br>
The conventional way of making ethanol from starch involves either acid or enzymatic hydrolysis followed by fermentation and atmospheric distillation. Anhydrous ethanol is obtained from the ethanol - water azeotrope produced in atmospheric distillation by several ways e.g. using a third component such as benzene to break the azeotrope or using either a hygroscopic solvent or a solid desicant to remove the water from aqueous ethanol.<br>
The conventional processes are both capital and energy intensive. For instance, it takes about 2 0 hours hold up time to complete fermentation of a given batch. Also both capital and energy consumption are high in obtaining anhydrous alcohol using any conventional azeotrope breaking process. A novel process has been conceived which attempts to cut down both fermentation hold up time and capital and energy cost for the production of anhydrous alcohol.<br>
It is known in my earlier Indian Patent No. 173212 as follows :<br>
1. Extractive Fermentation using a suitable organic<br>
solvent to produce 100% ethanol.<br>
2. Use of inert particles of proper shape in the aqueous<br>
medium and vibration of the fermenter to expedite<br>
fermentation by increasing the rate of mass transfer<br>
in and out of the yeast cells.<br>
3. Faster transfer of alcohol from aqueous to organic<br>
phase by recycling alcohol rich solution from bulk<br>
to intefacial region and withdrawal of alcohol<br>
depleted liquid from the interface and dispersal into<br>
the bulk.<br>
- 2  -<br><br>
4.      Cut down fermentation time and hence the size  of the fermentor.<br>
a)       Produce  100% alcohol  in organic medium. 5"      Produce  100% ethanol as  one of the product using simple technique  of extraction of alcohol  into an organic  solvent followed by distillation. The process   in the said Indian Patent generally consists of simultaneous fermentation and extraction where glucose  is fermented to ethanol and ethanol  is  simultaneously extracted  into an organic solvent.    The solvent  is  immiscible with respect of wate; but has high solubility for ethanol and  is  lighter than the aqueous phase.    A list of  organic  solvents  are given below  :<br>
1 .         1  - Decanol<br>
2 .        Ethyl benzene<br><br>
3. Isopropyl Benzene<br>
4. M-ethyl toluene<br>
5.   N - butyl propionate<br>
Amongst these solvents the desirable ones are those for which the distribution coefficients (which is as is well known the concentration ratio of alcohol between the organic phase and aqueou phase) are higher and boiling points are higher such that substantial amount of alcohol can be extracted into the organic phase and separation of alcohol from the organic solvent will be easier with less capital investment and lower operating cost.<br>
The quantity of organic solvent used depends upon a number of factors as follows :-<br>
a) Volume of aqueous phase and<br>
b) Distribution coefficient.<br>
Fermentation time is reduced due to lowering of alcohol concentration in the bulk caused by its migration to organic phase as it becomes produced. The density convection currents are<br>
- 3  -<br><br>
generated dud to diffusion of alcohol out of the aqueous phase into the organic phase due to the affinity of the alcohol produced towards the organic solvent which makes the layers of aqueous phase being depleted of alcohol heavier and hence these layers<br>
(upper layer) sink towards the bottom.<br><br>
The interface through which alcohol transfer occurs, for faster transfer from the bulk to the interface the aqueous phase can be pumped out from the bulk and discharge it nears the interface continuously during the simultaneous fermentation and extraction process. By maintaining a higher concentration near the interface a larger density gradient can be generated leading to higher rate of transfer. It is necessary to release the pumped liquid near the interface over the whole are uniformly, such that the velocity is reduced as it enters but sufficient to penetrate the whole width of the phase. Due to this operation more solute (alcohol) is absorbed uniformly at the interface and reduces the interfacial tension, which is a measure of energy barrier at the interface for solute transport. Also higher concentration on the aqueous side at the interface will cause higher concentration of it on the organic side leading to higher overall rate of mass transfer.<br>
Reference is invited to the said Patent for further additional details.<br>
As will be appreciated from the above Patent, fermentation of ethanol from, glucose takes place using yeast in the presence of an organic solvent and two distinct phases namely, Aqueous Phase and Organic Phase are obtained, and alcohol is recovered from both the aqueous phase and the organic phase.<br>
In further investigation of the process proposed in the said Patent, it has now...<br>
4<br><br>
said Patent,   it has now been discovered that the same starch can be used more effectively as  a source for glucose.<br>
It is now found that by modification of the above Patented process  it  is possible to use starch  in the modified process to produce alcohol at a faster rate and at a cheaper cost.<br>
After intensive study and experimentation  it has been found that excellent results  are  obtained   if the organic phase  is  also subjected to recycling techniques  as provided for the  aqueous  phase in the  Patented process.<br>
The reason behind this modification  is to recover maximum amount of alcohol from glucose at the shortest possible time.    In the modified process  it has been clearly observed that the rate of transfer of alcohol from the  aqueous phase  to the  organic phase   is affected by concentration factors  of alcohol  in the organic phase. In the earlier Patent the concentration of alcohol near the  interface was the maximum and  it gradually migrated  into the bulk of the organic media.    The concentration gradient of alcohol between the aqueous phase and the  organic phase  at the  interface was  less and hence the rate of production of absolute alcohol was also affected and more time was required due to slow migration of alcohol from the  interphase to the organic phase.<br>
After having understood the drawback I have been able to solve the (problem and  improve over the Patented process.<br>
I have withdrawn concentrated alcohol from near the  inter-hose  and transported  it by re-cycling into the bulk of the organic phase.    Also,   low concentration alcohol containing organic phase was recycled from bulk to the  interfacial region slightly below the  above mentioned entry point.    This  immediately created a higher concentration gradient of the  alcohol at the  interphase.<br>
-    5     -<br><br>
Thus,  simultaneously with the re-cycling of  alcohol in the organic phase from the near the  interphase to the bulk of the organic phase,  and from bulk to  interfacial region  I could automatically obtain faster migration of alcohol from aqueous phase to the organic phase.<br>
The total conversion of glucose to alcohol also increases in the modified process as yeast is  able to convert more glucose to alcohol  in the aqueous phase since the rate  of build up of alcohol in the aqueous phase   is more  gradual due to faster overall transfer of alcohol from aqueous to organic phase.<br>
That means I am able to control toxicity to yeast due to generally caused by high concentration of alcohol.<br>
Further advantages are obtained by re-cycling bulk of the organic phase to the interfacial region which help in faster rate of mass equalisation within the  organic phase.<br>
I have further found that  it  is also possible to use molasses  instead of starch as a source for glucose  in the  invented process, though,  the same could also used  in the patented process but not with that much advantage  as   in this  invented process.<br>
The features regarding the handling of the aqueous phase remain the; same as  in the earlier patented process.    In other words the techniques adopted in the aqueous phase of the earlier Patent were  also repeated for the organic phase.    In addition to the above to enhance higher rate of transfer of alcohol it was possible to vibrate the fermenting vessel and also add inert floating particles to increase the rate of production.    For further details  of the function of the particles and vibration, reference  is  invited to my earlier Patent No.173212.<br>
The  invention will now be more fully described with reference to the flow diagrams shown schematically in the figure of the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
-    6     -<br><br>
Thus according to this  invention there  is provided process for manufacture of ETHANOL from Glucose which comprises subjecting an aqueous  solution of around  10% concentration (wt/vol) of glucose and<br>
fermented above at around 30°C in the presence of yeast followed by separating Ethanol produced at a p.H. of 4-4.5 and wherein the fermentation  is carried out  in the presence of organic  solvent as herein described so as to obtain and aqueous phase containing a product of fermentation and organic phase  above the aqueous phase having high purity ethanol obtained from fermentation and wherein the  organic phase  and the  aqueous phase are maintained  in the volume ratio of 2:1 to l:1  subjecting the aqueous phase at the lower level of the  fermented to recirculate  in the  following manner:<br>
a)	Withdrawing a stream of the aqueous phase from the  intermediate<br>
location in the aqueous phase and recirculate same to the aqueous<br>
phase at a  level below that of the  inter phase of aqueous phase<br>
and organic phase ?<br>
b)	Withdraw the stream of aqueous phase from the  level immediately<br>
adjacent to inter phase from a location which is above the  location<br>
at which the first mentioned recirculated stream is admitted as<br>
mentioned in part  (a)  above and recirculating the said withdrawn<br>
stream to a  lower level  in the aqueous phase.<br>
c)	Withdrawing the product stream from near the bottom of the<br>
aqueous phase.<br>
d)	Subjecting said stream to centrifugation to separate spent<br>
yeast and Useful  liquid stream.<br>
e)	Recirculate the recovered yeast and  subjecting the useful<br>
liquid stream to distillation to obtain ethanol stream  (95% pure)<br>
and waste water effluent stream characterized in that the organic phase   is<br>
subjected to recirculation  in the following manner.<br>
-    7     -<br><br>
a) Withdrawing the organic stream containing alcohol from near and above inter-<br>
phase and re-circulate same to the bulk of the organic phase at a higher level.<br>
b) Withdrawing the stream organic phase from the bulk region and re-circulating the<br>
same at near the inter-phase.<br>
c) Withdrawing the product stream from the organic phase at a level substantially<br>
above me inter phase containing high purity alcohol.<br>
d) Subjecting the above stream to distillation to separate the organic solvent and<br>
the alcohol recycling the recovered solvent to the fermentor and recovering as<br>
alcohol final product stream having 100% ethanol.<br>
e) using finely divided inert particles in the aqueous phase in a suspended manner<br>
in order to provide more surface area for conversion of glucose to alcohol by<br>
means of yeast, and<br>
f) the fermentation being subjected to mechanical vibration of the fermentor at its<br>
lower region to keep the inert particles suspended and enhance rate of<br>
fermentation.<br>
Because of this modification it is now possible to use either starch or molasses as source for Glucose.<br>
It will be seen from the flow diagram shown in Fig.1 that a fermentor 1 is used in which fermentation of the required liquid takes place. An aqueous phase 2 is obtained which stays at the lower portion of the fermentor as aqueous phase. An organic solvent is used to extract the acohol produced due to fermentation and this produces an upper organic phase 3. The liquid slightly below the interface is recycled (4) to the aqueous phase. From an intermediate location in the aqueous phase, a stream 7 is withdrawn and partly recycled as stream 6 just below the level of the withdrawal of (4).<br>
8<br><br>
A stream 5 having alcohol  is withdrawn from the bottom of the  aqueous phase  and  is pumped to a centrifuge 8.    In the centrifuge  the  spent yeast  is  separated from the  liquid phase having the alcohol.    This   liquid phase  9  is  subjected to distillation  in the distillation column 10 to obtain distilled alcohol phase  11 of 95% strength ana a waste water stream 12  which is sent to the effluent treatment plant.<br>
In the earlier Patent,  the organic phase  containing the alcohol is withdrawn from a suitable location as  stream 13  and  is subjected to distillation in unit 14 for separation of the solvent and alcohol.    The distilled alcohol stream 15  is  1008 pure ethanol. The  solvent stream 16  is sent to the fermentor 1  as recycled stream.<br>
In this present modification,  the  organic phase   is  also subjected to recycling in a manner similar to the aqueous phase.<br>
Thus  it will now be seen that the liquid  in organic Phase-3 slightly above  the  inter phase   is  recycled to a higher  level as stream 4-A.     From an  intermediate   location  in this  organic phase  a stream 6-a just below the  level of withdrawal of  stream 4-A.<br>
A stream 5A having pure alcohol  (99.9%)   is withdrawn from the  top of the  organic phase  as  stream 13  and the subjected to distillation in unit 14 for separation of solvent and alcohol.    The distilled alcohol stream 15  is 100% pure ethanol.    The solvent stream 16  is sent to the fermentor 1 as recycled stream.<br>
The  invention is explained  in further detail  in the following example:<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
2 0 litres of Molasses diluted to 10% fermentable sugar (which  is Glucose),  specific gravity 1.08 and 2 0  litres solvent, ethyl benzene were subjected to fermentation at around 30°C in presence  of yeast for about 2.40 hrs. 87%; conversion of glucose  to<br>
_     9     -<br><br>
alcohol was achieved.    A recirculation of  7.5  lit/hr. of the  liquor was  maintained from the top of the aqueous   layer to the middle   layer. Also,  rate  of withdrawal of  liquid  from middle to top was  7.5  lt/hr. The amount of total ethanol produced at the end of fermentation was found to be  about 0.9568 Kg.  of alcohol in 3 hours.    This total amount of alcohol was the amount present  in the upper organic phase as 100% ethanol and  (ii)   in the  lower aqueous phase as 95% ethanol. The  amount of ethanol in the  organic phase   (2 0  litres)  was  about 0.426 Kg.    The amount of ethanol  in the  aqueous phase   (20 lit) was about  .53 kg.    I verified the correctness of the  amount of ethanol produced from the distribution co-efficient of solvent.<br>
EXAMPLE 2   :<br>
(1) Organic medium used was 20 litres of ethyl benzene  and<br>
aqueous phase was  also 2 0 litres.<br>
(2) Time of fermentation and extraction was 2 hours.<br>
(3) Inert particles used were hollow concentric open spheres<br>
of teflon.<br>
(4) Recycle rates were 5  litres /hr in both  instance   (in the<br>
aqueous phase).<br>
(5) Recirculation rates were 2   litre/hr in both instances  in<br>
the  organic phase.<br>
It was  found that the conversion of glucose to ethanol was 90%.    The concentration of ethanol  in the organic phase was   .02126 kg/lit and  in the  aqueous phase was   .02658 kg/lit giving a total yield  of  0,4252  kg.   in organic phase  and  0.5316  kg.   in aqueous  phase. A total of  0.9568 kg. of ethanol was thus  obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 3   :<br>
(1)	Organic medium used was 2 0  litres  of ethyl benzene  and<br>
aqueous phase was  also 2 0 litres.<br>
-    10    -<br><br>
(2) Time  of fermentation and extraction was  one hour and<br>
fifteen minutes at 30°C  in presence of yeast.<br>
(3) Inert particles used were hollow concentric open spheres<br>
of teflon.<br>
(4) Stecirculation rates were  5  litres/hour  in both  instances<br>
in the aqueous phase only.<br>
(5) Recirculation rates were 2   litres/liour  in both instances<br>
in the  organic phase  only.<br>
to was  found that the conversion of glucose   (using St/Md) to ethanol was  95%.    The concentration of ethanol  in the organic phase was  .0224 kg/lit and  in the aqueous phase was   .028 kg/lit giving a total yield of  .0448 kg in the organic phase  and  0.56 kg in the  aqueous phase.    A total of  1.008 kg. of ethanol was thus obtained.<br>
