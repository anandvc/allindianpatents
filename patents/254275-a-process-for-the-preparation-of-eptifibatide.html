PROCESSES FOR PREPARING EPTIFIBATIDE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/560,453, filed April 8, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In certain embodiments, the invention relates to novel processes for preparing eptifibatide, a drug used to treat cardiovascular disease. The invention also relates to compounds that can be used as synthetic intermediates for eptifibatide, to compounds that are structurally similar to eptifibatide, and to processes for purifying eptifibatide.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Eptifibatide is a highly specific cyclic heptapeptide antagonist of the platelet glycoprotein flb/IIIa. It is a short-acting parenteral antithrombotic agent that is used during percutaneous coronary interventions for the treatment of unstable angina and as an adjunct to thrombolytic agents for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. See, for example, Phillips et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry (1993), 268(2), 1066-73; and Scarborough, American Heart Journal (1999), 138(6, Pt. 1), 1093-1104. Eptifibatide is also administered to patients<br><br>
WO 2005/100381	PCT/US2005/011873<br>
-2-<br>
undergoing balloon angioplasty, a procedure for which over 1.0 million people in the U.S. are candidates annually.<br>
[0004] Eptifibatide is believed to work by inhibiting platelet aggregation, specifically, by blocking the platelet receptor GP Eb-IIIa. The aggregation of platelets can obstruct blood supply to the heart, causing unstable angina and, possibly, myocardial infarction (heart attack). The effects of eptifibatide are specific to platelets, avoiding interference with other normal cardiovascular processes, and the effects can be reversed when eptifibatide use is discontinued.<br>
[0005] Eptifibatide is marketed in the U.S. under the trademark INTEGRILIN®, and is used to treat patients with acute coronarysyndrome (unstable angina and non-Q-wave MI), including patients who are to be managed medically and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ("PCI"). Eptifibatide is also indicated for use at the time of percutaneous coronary interventions, including procedures involving intracoronary stenting.<br>
[0006] Many reported synthetic approaches to eptifibatide have employed known techniques of solid-phase peptide synthesis as described, for example, in U.S. Patents 5,318,899; 5,686,570 and 5,747,447. A commercial-scale, liquid phase process was also reported at the 1999 IBC Conference on Peptide Technologies, "Peptisyntha's Method of Producing GMP Peptides on an Industrial Scale". The commercial process is a convergent synthesis involving the separate preparation of two fragments: Mpa-Har-Gly and Asp-Trp-Pro. The coupling of these two fragments provides six of the seven residues needed for eptifibatide. The last residue attached is an S-trityl-protected cysteinamide as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,506,362. After removal of the S-trityl protecting groups (on the cysteinamide and mercaptopropionyl residues), ring closure is then achieved by disulfide bond formation. Crude eptifibatide obtained by the commercial process has a reported purity of about 80%. Two column chromatography steps improve the purity to greater than 99%.<br>
[0007] Liquid-phase synthesis has generally been viewed as more feasible than solid-phase synthesis for the large-scale manufacture of eptifibatide. However, solubility issues and the generation of complex reaction mixtures present challenges for large-scale liquid phase processes. Complex reaction mixtures, for example, make purification of the product more difficult. Ways exist to overcome these problems, such as the use of persilylated amino acids and phase transfer reagents, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,954,616, and extensive chromatographic purification, but such means add to the cost of the overall process.<br>
[0008] A need thus exists for alternative processes for the manufacture of eptifibatide.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0012] In one aspect, the present invention provides convergent processes for preparing eptifibatide that involve preparation of a 2-3 eptifibatide fragment, preparation of a 4-6 eptifibatide fragment, and coupling of the 2-3 and 4-6 eptifibatide fragments to form a 2-6 eptifibatide fragment.

and are described in detail in Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, 3rd Edition, 1999, published by John Wiley and Son, Inc..<br>
[0016] As used herein, the term "coupling," and all variations thereof, refers to the formation of an amide bond, by any means, between the moieties being joined.<br>
[0017] As used herein, the term "attaching," and all variations thereof,-refers to the formation of an amide or disulfide bond, by any means that can be used for form an amide or disulfide bond, between the moieties being joined.<br>
[0018] As used herein, the term "activated cysteinamide residue" refers to a cysteinamide residue that is capable of forming a disulfide bond with mercaptopropionic acid.<br>
[0019] As used herein, the term "Grly-eptifibatide" refers to a compound that is structurally related to eptifibatide but contains two adjacent glycine residues rather than a single glycine residue.<br>
[0020] All amino acid residues referred to herein are natural amino acids that have the L-configuration.<br>
[0022] Eptifibatide can also be represented using amino acid designations as follows:<br>
[0021] Eptifibatide has the following chemical structure:<br><br><br><br><br>
[0023] For the ease of description, the residues can also be numbered from (1) through (7). Residue (1) is mercaptopropionic acid; (2) is homoarginyl (Har); (3) is glycyl (Gly); (4) is aspartyl (Asp); (5) is tryptophanyl (Tip); (6) is prolyl (Pro); and (7) is cysteinamide (Cys-NHa).<br>
[0024] In certain embodiments, the present invention relates to convergent processes for preparing eptifibatide. In a first sequence of steps, a 2-3 eptifibatide fragment is prepared containing amino acids (2) and (3). In a second sequence, a 4-6 eptifibatide fragment is prepared containing amino acids (4), (5) and (6). The two fragments are then coupled to provide a single 2-6 fragment, which is a pentapeptide. The 2-6 fragment of eptifibatide is protected at the amino-terminal of the Har residue and at the aspartyl side chain carboxyl group. Scheme 1 outlines an exemplary process for the preparation of the 2-6 eptifibatide fragment:<br><br><br>
[0025] Sequence A of Scheme 1 shows the preparation of the 2-3 eptifibatide fragment and Sequence B shows the preparation of the 4-6 eptifibatide fragment. The two sequences converge to provide the 2-6 fragment of eptifibatide. Although Scheme 1 shows exemplary arnino acid protecting groups, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis that other known amino acid protecting groups can also be used. For example, in place of the Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) group, other carbamate protecting groups such as<br><br>
WO 2005/100381	PCT/US2005/011873<br>
-10-<br>
Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl), RCbz (benzyloxycarbonyl groups substituted on the aromatic ring), 9(2-sulfo)fluorenylmethylcarbamate, 9(2,7-dibromo)fiuorenylmethylcarbaniate, 2-chloro-3-indenylmethylcarbamate, Benz[f]inden-3-y]methylcarbamate, or Alloc (Allyloxycarbonyl) groups can be used.<br>
[0026], The t-butyl ester on the aspartyl residue can be replaced by any other protecting group that can be cleaved by acid treatment such as, for example, ODpm (diphenylmethyl ester) or protecting groups that can be cleaved by hydrogenolysis such as, for example, OBzl (benzyl ester).<br>
[0027] The Fmoc-Har moiety in the eptifibatide fragments depicted in Sequence A of Scheme 1 can be replaced by Rupi-Har, where RNPi is an amino protecting group such as, for example, a Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl) group, a RCbz (benzyloxycarbonyl substituted on the aromatic ring) group, or an Alloc (Allyloxycarbonyl) group. Similarly, the Z-Asp (or Cbz-Asp) moiety in the eptifibatide fragments depicted in Sequence B can be replaced by RNP2-ASP, where RNP2 is an amino protecting group that can be cleaved in basic conditions such as, for example, Fmoc (fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl), or where RNP2 is an amino protecting group that can be cleaved by hydrogenelysis such as, for example, a RCbz (benzyloxycarbonyle protecting group with substituted aromatic ring) group, hi addition, the -OtBu group depicted in Scheme 1 can be replaced by RCP, where Rep is a carboxyl protecting that can be cleaved by acid treatment, such as, for example, an ODpm (diphenylmethyl ester) group. Pfp (pentafiuorophenyl) can be replaced by RLI, where Rn is a carboxyl activating group; and Su (succinimide) can be replaced by Ru, where Ru is a carboxyl activating group. Independently of the nature of the fragment, both Pfp and Su can be replaced by other stable active esters such as, for example, mono and dinitrophenyl esters, tri- and pentaphenyl ester, It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the selection of particular protecting groups depends upon the identity of other protecting groups that exist on the same compound. In certain embodiments of the invention, a particular protecting group is chosen so that it can be removed selectively under reaction conditions that do not affect other protecting groups.<br>
[0028] In certain embodiments of the invention, the protected 2-6 eptifibatide fragment is next coupled to an "activated" cysteinamide (7), such as, for example, 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl-cysteinamide (H-Cys(Npys)-NH2); Nps (2-nitro-phenyl-sulfenyl); S-phenylthiocysteinamide, where the phenyl ring is substituted; S-alkylthiocysteinamide; or the S-sulfonate and S-sulfenylthiocarbonates of cysteinamide, to form the 2-7 hexapeptide fragment of<br><br>
WO 2005/100381	PCT/US2005/011873<br>
-11-<br>
eptifibatide. The remaining eptifibatide residue is mercaptopropionic acid or Mpa-OH (1). Mpa-OH is attached to the 2-7 hexapeptide fragment under conditions that form a disulfide linkage between 1 and the 2-7 fragment. The resulting disulfide piece, designated herein as Precursor A, is a key and novel precursor for making eptifibatide. The structure of Precursor A is shown below:<br>
Mpa-OH	(P1 )-Har-Gly-Asp(O-P2)-Trp-Pro-Cys-NH2<br>
S	—	S<br>
where Pi is an amino protecting group and P2 is a carboxyl protecting group. Preferably the P2 group is stable under conditions that are suitable for removal of the Pi group. The selection of compatible Pi and P2 groups that allow for the selective removal of only one of the groups is well-known in the art. An example of a compatible pair of protecting groups is Pi = Fmoc, which may be removed under basic conditions, and P? = t-butyl, which is stable under the same conditions.<br>
[0029] Scheme 2 outlines an exemplary process for the preparation of Precursor A:<br>
Scheme 2. Preparation of Precursor A from 2-6<br><br><br>
WO 2005/100381	PCT/US2005/011873<br>
-12-<br>
[0030] As in Scheme 1, the Fmoc and the t-butyl groups shown in Scheme 2 can be replaced by other known protecting groups that are generally recognized to be useful for peptide synthesis.<br>
[00311 In certain embodiments of the invention, removal of the Pi protecting group from Precursor A provides another precursor, Precursor B, which is the.2-7-1 portion of eptifibatide:<br>
Mpa-OH	H-Har-Gly-Asp(O-P2)-Trp-Pro-Cys-NH2<br><br>
 .<br>
[0032] Precursor B can be converted, via an intramolecular peptide coupling, to Precursor C:<br>
Mpa-Har-Gly-Asp(O-P2)-Trp-Pro-Cys-NH2<br>
I	I<br>
S	S<br>
The intramolecular peptide coupling can be effected, for example, in an organic solvent in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent such as, for example, a uronium-type coupling agent such as, but not limited to, 6)-[cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methylenamiiio]-Ar,A'r,A^',7v"-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU), HBTU, or TBTU (2-(lH-Benzotriazole-lyl)-l, 1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and tetrafluoroborate respectively); a carbodiimide type reagent such as, but not limited to, DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), DIC (diisopropylcarbodiimide), orEDC (l-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide); active esters; or phosphonium type coupling reagents such as, for example, Bop (benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tri(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) or PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate). Peptide coupling is described, for example, in Humphrey and Chamberlin, Chem. Rev. 1997, 97, 2243-2266, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0033] Removal ofthe P2 protecting group from Precursor C provides eptifibatide. The removal of P2 can be effected, for example, in an organic solvent in the presence of acid, base or any other reagent or reagent system in which the protecting group is labile. Scheme 3 outlines an exemplary process for the preparation of eptifibatide from Precursor A:<br><br>

[0034] After removal of the Fmoc protecting group, the 2-7-1 fragment undergoes an intramolecular peptide coupling to provide the t-butyl ester of eptifibatide. Removal of the t-butyl group from the aspartyl residue yields eptifibatide.<br>
[0035] In certain embodiments, the present invention also relates to compounds that are structurally similar to eptifibatide and are prepared according to processes that are similar to the processes described above for preparing eptifibatide. Such compounds include, for example,<br><br>
WO 2005/100381	PCT/US2005/011873<br>
-14 -<br>
-Gly-eptifibatide, which contains two adjacent glycine residues, rather than a single glycine residue as in eptifibatide:<br>
Mpa-Har-G!y-Gly-Asp-Trp-Pro-Cys-NH2<br><br>
Gly-eptifibatide can be prepared, for example, according to the procedure described above for preparing eptifibatide, except a Gly-Gly dipeptide is coupled to homoarginine to form what corresponds to the 2-3 eptifibatide fragment, rather than coupling glycine to homoarginine to form the fragment.

[0042] The following examples are illustrative of certain embodiments of the invention and should not be considered to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of Z-Asp(OtBu)-Trp-Pro-OH<br>
[0043] Z-Asp(OtBu)-Trp-Pro-OH was obtained by known procedures starting with the commercially available Z-Asp(OtBu)-OSu and H-Trp-Pro-OH as described, for example, in Bodanszky, M. (1979), Active esters in peptide synthesis, Tire peptides, Vol. 1 (ed. E. Gross and J: Meienhofer), Chapter 3. Academic Press, London, which is incorporated herein bv reference in its entirety.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of H-Asp(0-tBu)~Trp-Pro-OH<br>
[0044] To a 2 liter reactor charged with dimethylacetamide (DMAC, 1.2 L) at a temperature of about 20 °C was added 0.300 &gt;kg of starting material Z-Asp(OtBu)-Trp-Pro-OH, maintaining the temperature at about 20 °C. The Z-Asp(OtBu)-Trp-Pro-OH was allowed to dissolve and the reaction mixture was then purged and blanketed by a nitrogen atmosphere. Palladium on carbon (5 weight%) (0.015 kg) was added to the reaction mixture, followed by hydrogenation at a 2 bar pressure while the reaction mixture was maintained at about 20 °C.<br>
[0045] After two hours, and every hour thereafter, a sample from the reaction was analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analysis was conducted on Purospher Star C18 55*4 mm column with a water/acetonitrile solvent mixture containing 0.1% trifiuoroacetic acid (TFA) with a<br><br>

gradient of 98:2 water/acetonitrile to 2:98 water/acetonitrile in 10 minutes. HPLC detection was at 215 nm, flow was 2.0 mL/min, and the temperature was 40°C.<br>
[0046] The reaction was considered to be complete when the HPLC analysis showed<br>
the starting material to be less than or equal;to 0.2% relative to the product area percent. When<br>
the reaction was shown to be complete by HPLC, an aqueous solution of p-toluenesulfonic acid<br>
(0.094 kg p-TsOH in 0.150 L of water) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture<br>
was then filtered through Celite® that was pre-washed with DMAC (Celite® washed three<br>
times with 0.6 L). After filtration of reaction mixture, the filter cake was washed three times<br>
with fresh DMAC (0.3 L). HPLC analysis after the.last wash was performed to confirm that no<br>
product remained in the filter cake.	. .<br>
[0047] The combined filtrates were transferred to a new vessel at about 20 °C, at which temperature N-ethylmorpholine (0.066 L) was added. The temperature was maintained below about 22 °C during the addition. The mixture was then cooled to about 8-12 °C and water (3 L) was added slowly so as to maintain the temperature below about 15 °C. The mixture was then stirred at about 8-12 °C for about 30 minutes and held at that temperature for 8 hours. During this time the product crystallized out of solution. The supernatant can be analyzed by HPLC to determine the amount of product still in solution and whether further cooling is necessary. The slurry obtained was filtered and the collected solids were washed twice with a 2:1 solution of watenDMAC (0.9 L each). The solids were then washed twice with acetonitrile (0.9 L each) and dried under a vacuum below about 25 °C until at a constant weight. The water content after drying was 3.5% (Karl-Fisher analysis).<br>
[0048] The product was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using an aqueous trifiuoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient.<br>

solid dissolved. N-ethylrnorpholine (NEM) (0.030 L) was added drop wise, followed by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (0.072 kg) in THF (0.179 L) and the mixture was stirred at about 20 °C. The formation of Fmoc-Har-Gfy-OPfp was followed by HPLC assay. After about 17 hours, the ratio of Fmoc-Har-Gly-OH / Fmoc-Har-Gly-OPfp was 1.5/98.5.<br>
[0052] To the reaction mixture was added H-Asp(O-tBu)-Trp-Pro-OH (0.146 kg, about 3.5 w/w% H2O) and NEM (0.049 L). The mixture was stirred at about 20 °C for 3 hours. At that time, HPLC analysis showed the mixture to contain about 87% of product, 
[0053] The reaction mixture was filtered and the solid was washed twice with a 5/1 mixture of THF/DMAC (2 x 0.489 L). The filtrate was concentrated to about 0.815 L at no more than 35 °C under reduced pressure (about 20 mBar). The concentrated mixture was added slowly over 1 h to 1/4 mixture of acetonitrile/H2O (4.1 L) containing sodium bicarbonate (0.059 kg). The addition rate was carefully controlled to avoid formation of a gummy precipitate. About 3.5% of the solution was added over about 15 min, and the addition was interrupted to stir the slurry at about 20°C for 1 h. The pasty precipitate turned to white slurry. 7.5 extra % of the solution was added over 15 to 30 min, and the addition was interrupted again to stir the slurry at about 20°C for 2 h. The remaining 89% of solution was added over about 2 h. The mixture was stirred at about 20 °C for 12 h then filtered. The solid was washed with a 1/4 mixture of acetonitrile/H2O (3 x 0.7 L), a 2/3 mixture of acetonitrile/di-isopropylether (DIPE) (3 x 0.7 L) and DIPE (2 x 0.7 L). The solid product was dried at T

The mixture was cooled to about 0°C, and H-Cys(NPys)-NH2 was added as the solid hydrochloride salt (0.080 kg). O-Beiizotriazol-l-yl-iV;7V;7V',iVr'-tetramethyluro:niurn tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) (0.082 kg) was added to the reaction mixture. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 6.5 to 7.0 by the portion-wise addition of diisopropylethylarnine (DIPEA)(0.112 L), while maintaining the temperature at about 0°C: The mixtureiwas stirred jat thattemperature, during which time samples were analyzed by HPLC for product formation about ever}' 45 minutes. The pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at pH 6.5 to 7.0 with the addition of DIPEA as needed. HPLC analysis was conducted on a Platinum EPS 100-5 C18 5u 250*4.6 mm column ; Solvent A: TFA 0.1 % in water; Solvent B: TFA 0.1% in acetonitrile; gradient: 12 to 98% B in 15 minutes. HPLC detection was at 215 nm, flow 2.0 mL/min and the temperature was 40°C. The reaction was considered complete when the pentapeptide and Cys(NPys)-NH2 starting materials were each shown to be less than 1 % by HPLC. Otherwise, additional TBTU, DIPEA and the starting material shown to be deficient in the mixture were added.<br>
[0058] The reaction mixture was added to another vessel that contained water (4.5 L) at a temperature of about 5°C. This temperature was maintained during the addition with stirring. After stirring for 10 minutes at about 5°C, the mixture was filtered and the solid was washed five times with water (0.9 L each). The solid was then washed three times with toluene (0.675 L each). The washes with toluene can be replaced by washes with diisopropyl ether. The solid was dried under vacuum at 35°C or below until a constant weight was achieved. The water content after drying was 1.2% (Karl-Fisher analysis).<br>

[0096] The stationary phase for the NEUOAc desalting/ AcOH concentration was a Kromasil C18, 10 urn, 100 A column with a diameter of 5 cm. The column pressure was 40 ± 5 bars, the flow rate was 50 ml/min, and the detection wavelength was 215 nm. The mobile phases were as follows:<br>
Solvent A: AcOH 0.5 % in processed water / CH3CN (95/5);<br>
Solvent B: AcOH 0.5 % in processed water / CH3CN (50/50); and<br>
Solvent C: NH4OAC 100 mM pH: 6.5 in processed water / CH3CN (95/5).<br><br>

[0097] The column was equilibrated by elution of 100 % solvent A over 15 minutes. For column loading, the main fraction from the AcjOH purification was diluted with 2 volumes of processed water.<br>
[0098] The desalting was preformed as follows: 10 minutes of solvent A; 10 minutes of solvent C; 10 minutes of solvent A; and 10 minutes of solvent C.<br>
[0099] Concentration was preformed as follows: 10 minutes of solvent A and 50 % B over 15 minutes.<br>
[0100] The desalting and concentration were monitored using method MAD-009-SF323TG1 and the target acceptance criteria were as follows:<br>
Main fraction (Fl): &gt; 99.0 % with impurities 
Side fraction (Fp): &gt; 80.0 % and
