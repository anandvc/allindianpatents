RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]        This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional application no.<br>
60/705,653, filed August 3,2005, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their<br>
entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       Anthrax is a well-characterized infectious disease caused by the sporulating bacteria<br>
Bacillus anthracis. The disease is historically associated with animal infections, especially herbivores<br>
such as cows, sheep, and goats, and is not typically found in humans. However, humans working with<br>
animal products where infection occurs are at risk of contracting anthrax. Some regions of the Middle<br>
East and sub-Saharan Africa are hyperendemic for anthrax, though the organism can often be found in<br>
many areas of the world. The disease manifests in three different ways: cutaneous, gastrointestinal<br>
and inhalation anthrax result from exposure of an open wound to spores, ingesting spores in<br>
contaminated meat products, or inhaling spores, respectively. While cutaneous anthrax has a fatality<br>
rate of up to 25 percent, gastrointestinal or inhalation anthrax results in nearly 100 percent fatalities.<br>
Definitive diagnosis of anthrax infection often comes too late to provide resuscitative care.<br>
[0003]       The principal virulence factor of B. anthrads is a multi-component toxin secreted by the<br>
organism. The toxin consists of three proteins designated protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF)<br>
and edema factor (EF), which are encoded by the genes pag, lef, and cya, respectively. PA is a 735<br>
ammo acid protein of molecular weight 83 kDa. It binds to the anthrax toxin receptor (ATR) on a<br>
mammalian cell surface, and subsequently undergoes a furin-mediated cleavage to yield a 63 kDa<br>
receptor-bound product The 63 kDa PA fragment forms a heptameric complex on the cell surface<br>
which is capable of interacting with either LF or EF, and this complex is subsequently internalized.<br>
LF is a zinc metalloprotease that cleaves several isoforms of MAP kinase kinase, thereby disrupting<br>
signal transduction events within a cell, eventually leading to cell death. LF is considered responsible<br>
for the lethal outcome of anthrax infection. EF is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that<br>
causes deregulation of cellular physiology, leading to clinical manifestations that include edema. PA<br>
and LF together are referred to as lethal toxin.<br>
[0004]        The CDC lists anthrax as a category A disease agent and estimates the cost of an anthrax<br>
attack to exceed $26 billion per 100,000 persons exposed. Presently, the only vaccine licensed for<br>
human use in the U.S., Biothrax (formerly Anthrax vaccine adsorbed, or AVA), is an aluminum<br>
hydroxide-adsorbed, formalin-treated subunit vaccine based on protective antigen, PA. It is delivered<br>
by subcutaneous injection and induces immunity against lethal toxin secreted by the bacillus. The<br>
vaccine is produced from the filtered culture supernatant fraction of the V77O-"NP1-R strain of B.<br>
anthrads. The production process is complex, there is variation from batch-to-batch in vaccine<br>
preparation lots, and the precise composition of the vaccine is undetermined. Furthermore, since alum<br>
1<br><br>
is included as an adjuvant with the current vaccine, a cold chain must be maintained during vaccine<br>
storage and distribution, adding inconvenience and cost. The vaccine is administered by injection,<br>
which can complicate the logistics of mass treatments. Thus, it would be desirable to have additional<br>
reagents capable of countering the infectious potential of an anthrax outbreak or attack.<br>
[0005]        Monoclonal antibodies are of increasing importance for a variety of therapeutic as well as<br>
diagnostic, industrial, and research purposes. For example, several animal studies have demonstrated<br>
anthrax toxin-specific antibodies from vaccinated animals can passively protect recipients from lethal<br>
effects of infection. However, animal-derived sera has obvious drawbacks which prevent widespread<br>
use as therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridomas must be harvested from medium<br>
in which the hybridomas are cultured or harvested from mouse ascites fluid. Unfortunately, these<br>
production systems are expensive, labor-intensive, and have other significant disadvantages. For<br>
these reasons and others it would be desirable to be able to utilize alternative production systems for<br>
monoclonal antibodies such as production systems involving recombinant DNA technology.<br>
[0006]        Concerns regarding sufficient access and limited supply of reagents, product cost, and<br>
reagent purity underscore the urgent need for improved products and reagents. Thus, there exists a<br>
clear need and urgency for improved approaches to counter potential anthrax infection, as well as for<br>
improved methods of diagnostic detection, and research tools useful in examination of anthrax<br>
infection mechanism. Furthermore, it is desireable to provide production methods that allow for<br>
mass-production of products useful in such applications at reasonable cost.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Brief Description of the Drawing<br>
[0008]       Figure 1 is a photograph of a gel showing SDS-PAGE analysis of PA and PANG<br>
(nonglycosylated) plant-produced antibodies. IgG standards are purified total human IgG. Positions<br>
of the heavy (H) and light (L) chains are indicated by arrows.<br>
[0009]       Figure 2 is a graph depicts results of rat half life studies of plant produced PA (PA), or<br>
PANG (PANG), LF (LF) antibody.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0010]       The terms "antibody", "antibody chain", "variable region or domain", "constant region or<br>
domain", "gamma chain", "kappa chain", "lambda chain", "heavy chain", "light chain", and other<br>
terms relevant to antibodies are used herein in accordance with their art-accepted meanings as<br>
described, e.g., in Goldby, R.A., Kuby Immunology, supra, and/or Harlow, supra.<br>
[0011]       The term "cDNA" refers to a single-stranded DNA molecule that is complementary to an<br>
mRNA or to a double-stranded DNA molecule that comprises a strand that is complementary to an<br>
mRNA. The other strand of the double-stranded cDNA will have the same sequence as the mRNA<br>
and will thus encode the same polypeptide as the mRNA.<br>
[0012]     An "expression vector" is a vector that contains regulatory sequences (e.g., promoters<br>
and/or other expression signals and, optionally, 3' sequences, such as 3' regulatory sequences or<br>
termination signals sufficient to drive transcription of a nucleic acid segment to which they are<br>
operably linked. The expression vector may also comprise operably linked sequences required for<br>
proper translation of the nucleic acid segment. The nucleic acid segment may, but need not be, a<br>
protein coding sequence.   The nucleic acid segment may be chimeric, meaning that it includes more<br>
than one sequence of distinct origin that are joined together by recombinant DNA techniques,<br>
resulting in a nucleotide sequence that does not occur naturally. The term "expression vector" can<br>
refer to a vector either before or after insertion of the operably linked nucleic acid segment. Certain<br>
expression vectors allow the shuttling of DNA between hosts such as bacteria-yeast, or bacteria-<br>
animal cells, or bacteria-fungal cells, or bacteria-invertebrate cells, or bacteria-plant cells. A typical<br>
expression vector will contain an origin of replication for autonomous replication in host cells, one or<br>
more selectable markers, one or more (typically several) useful restriction enzyme sites, frequently a<br>
potential for high copy number, and one or more promoters.<br>
[0013]       "Identity" refers to the extent to which the sequence of two or more nucleic acids is the<br>
same. The percent identity between first and second nucleic acids over a window of evaluation may<br>
be computed by aligning the nucleic acids, determining the number of nucleotides within the window<br>
of evaluation that are opposite an identical nucleotide allowing the introduction of gaps to maximize<br>
identity, dividing by the total number of nucleotides in the window, and multiplying by 100. When<br>
3<br><br>
computing the number of identical nucleotides needed to achieve a particular % identity, fractions are<br>
ro be rounded to the nearest whole number. When two or more sequences are compared, any of them<br>
may be considered the reference sequence.<br>
[0014]        Percent identity can be calculated using a variety of computer programs known in the art.<br>
For example, computer programs such as BLASTN, BLASTP, Gapped BLAST, etc., generate<br>
alignments and provide % identity between a sequence of interest and sequences in any of a variety of<br>
public databases. The algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 87:22264-2268,1990) modified as in Karlin and Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-<br>
5877,1993 is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. (Altschul, et<br>
al.,J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, 1990). To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped<br>
BLAST is utilized as described in Altschul et al. (Altschul, et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402,<br>
1997). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective<br>
programs are used. See the Web site having URL www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. A PAM250 or<br>
BLOSUM62 matrix may be used.<br>
[0015]        The term "isolated" means 1) separated from at least some of the components with which<br>
it is usually associated in nature; 2) prepared or purified by a process that involves the hand of man;<br>
and/or 3) not occurring in nature. A nucleic acid that is excised from or amplified from a larger<br>
nucleic acid (e.g., a chromosome, episome, viral or bacterial genome) in which it is naturally found is<br>
considered isolated. In some embodiments the excised or amplified nucleic acid is no longer joined to<br>
non-coding regions (but may be joined to its native regulatory regions or portions thereof), or to other<br>
genes, which are located upstream or downstream from the isolated nucleic acid as found in the larger<br>
nucleic acid. Isolated nucleic acids include nucleic acids inserted into plasmids, cosmids, artificial<br>
chromosomes, viral vectors, and the like, i.e., a nucleic acid that forms part of a recombinant nucleic<br>
acid construct is considered isolated. An isolated nucleic acid can be an amplification product (e.g., a<br>
PCR product), an isolated mRNA, a cDNA, a restriction fragment, etc. An isolated polypeptide can<br>
be a polypeptide expressed in a heterologous expression system, i.e., expressed by a cell that does not<br>
express the polypeptide in nature. An isolated antibody can be an antibody that is present in a<br>
composition other than blood or serum. An antibody that is expressed from an isolated nucleic acid is<br>
considered to be an isolated antibody. Any of the nucleic acids, antibody chains, or antibodies of the<br>
invention can be provided in isolated form.<br>
[0016]       The terms "nucleic acid", "polynucleotide", and "oligonucleotide" are used<br>
interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of at least three nucleotides. A nucleoside comprises a<br>
nitrogenous base linked to a sugar molecule. In a polynucleotide, phosphate groups covalently link<br>
adjacent nucleosides to form a polymer. The polymer may include natural nucleosides (e.g.,<br>
adenosine, thymidine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine, deoxyadenosine, deoxythymidine,<br>
deoxyguanosine, and deoxycytidine), nucleoside analogs, chemically modified bases, biologically<br>
4<br><br>
modified bases (e.g., methylated bases), intercalated bases, modified sugars (e.g, modified purines or<br>
pyrimidines). See Kornberg and Baker, DNA Replication, 2nd Ed. (Freeman, San Francisco, 1992),<br>
Scheit, Nucleotide Analogs (John Wiley, New York, 1980), and U.S. Patent Publication No.<br>
20040092470 and references therein for further discussion of various nucleotides, nucleosides, and<br>
backbone structures that can be used in the polynucleotides described herein, and methods for<br>
producing them. Analogs such as peptide nucleic acids, locked nucleic acids, etc., are also within the<br>
scope of the invention. A polynucleotide may be of any size or sequence and may be single- or<br>
double-stranded. An oligonucleotide is typically less than 100 nucleotides in length. Any nucleic<br>
acid disclosed herein can be in single or double-stranded form. Where the invention provides a<br>
nucleic acid sequence, the complementary sequence is also provided. Furthermore, where a sequence<br>
is provided as DNA, the corresponding RNA sequence (i.e., the sequence in which T is replaced by U,<br>
is also provided).<br>
[0017]        The term "nucleic acid construct" is used to refer to a nucleic acid that has been modified<br>
by the hand of man or is derived from such a nucleic acid. For example, a nucleic acid construct can<br>
contain a mutation, deletion, or substitution relative to a naturally occurring nucleic acid molecule. A<br>
nucleic acid construct can comprise two or more nucleic acid segments that are derived from or<br>
originate from different sources such as different organisms, e.g., a recombinant polynucleotide. The<br>
sequence of one or more portions of a nucleic acid construct may be entirely invented by man.<br>
[0018]        The term "nucleic acid sequence" as used herein can refer to the nucleic acid material<br>
itself and is not restricted to the sequence information (i.e. the succession of letters chosen among the<br>
five base letters A, G, C, T, or U) that biochemically characterizes a specific nucleic acid, e.g., a DNA<br>
or RNA molecule.<br>
[0019]       "Operably linked" or "operably associated" refers to a functional relationship between<br>
two nucleic acids, wherein the expression, activity, localization, etc., of one of the sequences is<br>
controlled by, directed by, regulated by, modulated by, etc., the other nucleic acid. The two nucleic<br>
acids are said to be operably linked or operably associated. "Operably linked" or "operably<br>
associated" also refers to a relationship between two polypeptides wherein the expression of one of<br>
the polypeptides is controlled by, directed by, regulated by, modulated by, etc., the other polypeptide.<br>
The two nucleic acids are said to be operably linked or operably associated. For example,<br>
transcription of a nucleic acid is directed by an operably linked promoter; post-transcriptional<br>
processing of a nucleic acid is directed by an operably linked processing sequence; translation of a<br>
nucleic acid is directed by an operably linked translational regulatory sequence such as a translation<br>
initiation sequence; transport, stability, or localization of a nucleic acid or polypeptide is directed by<br>
an operably linked transport or localization sequence such as a secretion signal sequence; and post-<br>
translational processing of a polypeptide is directed by an operably linked processing sequence.<br>
Preferably a first nucleic acid sequence that is operably linked to a second nucleic acid sequence, or a<br>
5<br><br>
first polypeptide that is operativeiy linked to a second polypeptide, is covalently linked, either directly<br>
or indirectly, to such a sequence, although any effective three-dimensional association is acceptable.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that multiple nucleic acids, or multiple polypeptides,<br>
may be operably linked or associated.<br>
[0020]        The term "primer" refers to a single-stranded oligonucleotide which acts as a point of<br>
initiation of template-directed DNA synthesis under appropriate conditions (e.g., in the presence of<br>
four different nucleoside triphosphates and a polymerization agent, such as DNA polymerase, RNA<br>
polymerase or reverse transcriptase) in an appropriate buffer solution containing any necessary<br>
cofactors and at a suitable temperature. The appropriate length of a primer depends on the intended<br>
use of the primer, but typically ranges from approximately 10 to approximately 50 nucleotides. A<br>
primer need not be perfectly complementary to the template but should be sufficiently complementary<br>
to hybridize with it. A primer can be provided in double-stranded form, i.e., hybridized to its<br>
complement.<br>
[0021]        "Purified", as used herein, means that an entity or substance is separated from one or<br>
more other entities or substances with which it was previously found before being purified. An entity<br>
or substance may be partially purified, substantially purified, or pure. A substance or entity such as a<br>
nucleic acid or polypeptide is considered pure when it is removed from substantially all other<br>
compounds or entities other than a solvent and any ions contained in the solvent, i.e., it constitutes at<br>
least about 90%, more preferably at least about 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or<br>
greater than 99% of the dry weight of the composition. A partially or substantially purified compound<br>
or entity such as a nucleic acid or polypeptide may be removed from at least 50%, at least 60%, at<br>
least 70%, or at least 80% of the material with which it is naturally found, e.g., cellular material such<br>
as cellular proteins and/or nucleic acids. In certain embodiments the of a purified nucleic acid or<br>
polypeptide constitutes at least 10%, 2Q%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or even<br>
more, by dry weight, of the total nucleic acid or polypeptide, respectively, in a composition. Methods<br>
for assessing purity are known in the art and include chromatrographic methods, immunological<br>
methods, electrophoretic methods, etc.<br>
[0022]        The term "regulatory element" or "regulatory sequence" in reference to a nucleic acid is<br>
generally used herein to describe a portion of nucleic acid that directs or controls one or more steps in<br>
the expression (particularly transcription, but in some cases other events such as splicing or other<br>
processing) of nucleic acid sequence(s) with which it is operativeiy linked. The term includes<br>
promoters and can also refer to enhancers, silencers, and other transcriptional control elements.<br>
Promoters are regions of nucleic acid that include a site to which RNA polymerase binds before<br>
initiating transcription and that are typically necessary for even basal levels of transcription to occur.<br>
Generally such elements comprise a TATA box. Enhancers are regions of nucleic acid that<br>
encompass binding sites for protein(s) that elevate transcriptional activity of a nearby or distantly<br>
6<br><br>
located promoter, typically above some basal level of expression that would exist in the absence of the<br>
enhancer. In some embodiments of the invention, regulatory sequences may direct constitutive<br>
expression of a nucleotide sequence, e.g., expression may occur in most or all cell types and/or under<br>
most or all conditions; in other embodiments, regulatory sequences may direct cell or tissue-specific<br>
and/or inducible expression. For example, expression may be induced by the presence or addition of<br>
an inducing agent such as a hormone or other small molecule, by an increase in temperature, etc.<br>
Regulatory elements may also inhibit or decrease expression of an operatively linked nucleic acid.<br>
Regulatory elements that behave in this manner will be referred to herein as "negative regulatory<br>
elements.<br>
[0023]        In general, the level of expression may be determined using standard techniques for<br>
measuring mRNA or protein. Such methods include Northern blotting, in situ hybridization, RT-<br>
PCR, sequencing, immunological methods such as immunoblotting, immunodetection, or<br>
fluorescence detection following staining with fluorescently labeled antibodies, oligonucleotide or<br>
cDNA microarray or membrane array, protein array analysis, mass spectrometry, etc. A convenient<br>
way to determine expression level is to place a nucleic acid that encodes a readily detectable marker<br>
(e.g., a fluorescent or luminescent protein such as green fluorescent protein or luciferase, an enzyme<br>
such as alkaline phosphatase, etc.) in operable association with the regulatory element in an<br>
expression vector, introduce the vector into a cell type of interest or into an organism, maintain the<br>
cell or organism for a period of time, and then measure expression of the readily detectable marker,<br>
taking advantage of whatever property renders it readily detectable (e.g., fluorescence, luminescence,<br>
alteration of optical property of a substrate, etc.). Comparing expression in the absence and presence<br>
of the regulatory element indicates the degree to which the regulatory element affects expression of an<br>
operatively linked sequence.<br>
[0024]         "Specific binding" generally refers to a physical association between a target polypeptide<br>
(or, more generally, a target molecule) and a binding molecule such as an antibody or ligand. The<br>
association is typically dependent upon the presence of a particular structural feature of the target such<br>
as an antigenic determinant or epitope recognized by the binding molecule. For example, if an<br>
antibody is specific for epitope A, the presence of a polypeptide containing epitope A or the presence<br>
of free unlabeled A in a reaction containing both free labeled A and the binding molecule that binds<br>
thereto, will reduce the amount of labeled A that binds to the binding molecule. It is to be understood<br>
that specificity need not be absolute but generally refers to the context in which the binding occurs.<br>
For example, it is well known in the art that numerous antibodies cross-react with other epitopes in<br>
addition to those present in the target molecule. Such cross-reactivity may be acceptable depending<br>
upon the application for which the antibody is to be used. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able<br>
to select antibodies or ligands having a sufficient degree of specificity to perform appropriately in any<br>
given application (e.g., for detection of a target molecule, for therapeutic purposes, etc).   It is also to<br>
be understood that specificity may be evaluated in the context of additional factors such as the affinity<br>
7<br><br>
of the binding molecule for the target versus the affinity of the binding molecule for other targets, e.g.,<br>
competitors. If a binding molecule exhibits a high affinity for a target molecule that it is desired to<br>
detect and low affinity for nontarget molecules, the antibody will likely be an acceptable reagent.<br>
Once the specificity of a binding molecule is established in one or more contexts, it may be employed<br>
in other, preferably similar, contexts without necessarily re-evaluating its specificity. Binding of two<br>
or more molecules may be considered specific if the affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd) is<br>
at least 10-3 M, preferably l0-4M, more preferably 10-5 M, e.g., 10-6M, 1(T-7M, 10-8M, or i(r M under<br>
the conditions tested, e.g., under physiological conditions.<br>
[0025]        "Subject", as used herein, refers to an individual to whom an antibody composition is to<br>
be delivered, e.g., for experimental, diagnostic, and/or therapeutic purposes. Preferred subjects are<br>
mammals, particularly domesticated mammals (e.g., dogs, cats, etc.), primates, or humans.<br>
[0026]        "Treating", as used herein, can generally include reversing, alleviating, reducing,<br>
inhibiting the progression of, or reducing the likelihood of the disease, disorder, or condition to which<br>
such term applies, or one or more symptoms or manifestations of such disease, disorder or condition.<br>
"Preventing" refers to causing a disease, disorder, condition, or symptom or manifestation of such, or<br>
worsening of the severity of such, not to occur.<br>
[0027]        "Vector" is used herein to refer to a nucleic acid or a virus, viral genome, or portion<br>
thereof (e.g., a viral capsid or a component of a viral genome) capable of mediating entry of, e.g.,<br>
transferring, transporting, etc., a nucleic acid molecule into a cell. Where the vector is a nucleic acid,<br>
the nucleic acid molecule to be transferred is generally linked to, e.g., inserted into, the vector nucleic<br>
acid molecule. A nucleic acid vector may include sequences that direct autonomous replication<br>
within suitable host cells (e.g., an origin of replication), or may include sequences sufficient to allow<br>
integration of part of all of the nucleic acid into host cell DNA. Useful nucleic acid vectors include,<br>
for example, DNA or RNA plasmids, cosmids, and naturally occurring or modified viral genomes or<br>
portions thereof or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) that can be packaged into viral capsids. Plasmid<br>
vectors typically include an origin of replication and one or more selectable markers. Plasmids may<br>
include part or all of a viral genome (e.g., a viral promoter, enhancer, processing or packaging signals,<br>
etc.). Viruses or portions thereof (e.g., viral capsids) that can be used to introduce nucleic acid<br>
molecules into cells are referred to as viral vectors. Useful animal viral vectors include adenoviruses,<br>
retroviruses, lentiviruses, vaccinia virus and other poxviruses, herpex simplex virus, and others.<br>
Useful plant viral vectors include those based on tobamoviruses, ilarviruses, etc. Viral vectors may or<br>
may not contain sufficient viral genetic information for production of infectious virus when<br>
introduced into host cells, i.e., viral vectors may be replication-defective, and such replication-<br>
defective viral vectors may be preferable for certain embodiments of the invention. Where sufficient<br>
information is lacking it may, but need not be, supplied by a host cell or by another vector introduced<br>
into the cell.<br>

Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments of the Invention<br>
[0028]       The invention is directed to nucleic acids encoding the monoclonal antibody (MAb) PA,<br>
and nucleic acids encoding the monoclonal antibody LF. Antibodies encoded by the nucleic acids, and<br>
functional fragments thereof, specifically recognize the anthrax proteins PA and LF, respectively, and<br>
inhibit activity, and productive anthrax infection. The invention is also directed to nucleic acids<br>
encoding and to polypeptides comprising modified forms of PA and/or LF, and functional fragments<br>
thereof. These antibodies and functional fragments retain the binding specificity and inhibitory<br>
activity of the parent murine antibody PA and/or LF. The invention is additionally directed to<br>
optimized forms of PA and/or LF antibodies that exhibit increased binding affinity and specificity<br>
compared to the parental forms of the PA and/or LF antibody,<br>
[0029]       The hybridoma method, first described by Kohler &amp; Milstein, Nature 256: 495,1975, is<br>
widely used for the identification of monoclonal antibodies that exhibit desired binding properties.<br>
Briefly, the techique generally involves isolating lymphocytes from an immunized mammal, fusing<br>
the lymphocytes with myeloma cells, and isolating clonal cell lines (hybridomas) generated from the<br>
fusion. These cell lines are screened to identify those that produce an antibody that binds to the<br>
polypeptide of interest or to a particular portion or antigenic determinant thereof. Lines can also be<br>
screened to identify ones that produce an antibody having a desired affinity for the target polypeptide.<br>
The immunized mammal may have been deliberately immunized, e.g., vaccinated, or may have been<br>
infected by an infectious organism, exposed to an antigen, etc. Thus an "immunized mammal" refers<br>
to any mammal that produces an antibody that specifically binds to a polypeptide of interest. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention the mammal is a human being, e.g., a human being<br>
who has been vaccinated against an infectious agent, exposed to an infectious agent, etc.<br>
[0030]        The present invention provides oligonucleotide primers and primer sets for use in<br>
isolating cPNAs that encode antibody heavy or light chains from hybridomas, e.g., using polymerase<br>
chain reaction (PCR).<br>
[0031]       In one embodiment, an oligonucleotide comprises any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-44. In<br>
another embodiment, an oligonucleotide consists of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1-44. In other aspects, the<br>
restriction enzyme site provided in certain primers may be modified to any preferred restriction<br>
enzyme site, in order to adapt the primers to desirable vector insert sites.<br>
[0032]       In another aspect, the invention provides a method of isolating a nucleic acid that encodes<br>
an antibody chain or portion thereof. In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of: (a)<br>
contacting nucleic acids obtained from an antibody-producing cell with at least one oligonucleotide<br>
primer selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-44; and (b) performing an amplification<br>
reaction. The amplification reaction is typically a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In certain<br>
embodiments of the invention step (a) comprises containct the nucleic acids with at least two<br>
9<br><br>
oligonucleotide primers selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-44. It will be<br>
appreciated that while the primers and methods of the present invention may have particular use for<br>
cloning antibody chain cPNAs (i.e., cDNAs that encode an antibody chain) from hybridomas, they<br>
are in no way limited to that purpose but can be used for cloning antibody chain cDNAs from any<br>
antibody producing cell, cell line, etc. Preferably the antibody chain is a human antibody chain.<br>
[0033]        In another aspect, the invention provides nucleic acid compositions encoding antibody<br>
polypeptide chains, or functional fragments thereof which bind an anthrax protein. In one<br>
embodiment, nucleic acid compositions encoding antibody polypeptide chain or a functional fragment<br>
thereof comprise a functional protein which binds B. anthracis protective antigen. In one<br>
embodiment provided is a nucleic acid that encodes a kappa light chain of a monoclonal antibody, or<br>
a functional fragment thereof, that binds to B. anthracis protective antigen. In one embodiment the<br>
nucleic acid is or comprises the sequence of a cDNA. In another embodiment, provided is a nucleic<br>
acid that encodes a gamma heavy chain of a monoclonal antibody, or a functional fragment thereof,<br>
that binds to B. anthracis protective antigen. In one embodiment the nucleic acid is or comprises the<br>
sequence of a cDNA.<br>
[0034]        In one embodiment, nucleic acid compositions encoding antibody polypeptide chain or a<br>
functional fragment thereof comprise a functional protein which binds B. anthracis lethal factor. In<br>
one embodiment, provided is a nucleic acid that encodes a kappa light chain of a monoclonal<br>
antibody, or a functional fragment thereof, that binds to B. anthracis lethal factor. In one embodiment<br>
the nucleic acid is or comprises the sequence of a cDNA. In another embodiment, provided is a<br>
nucleic acid that encodes a gamma heavy chain of a monoclonal antibody, or a functional fragment<br>
thereof, that binds to B. anthracis lethal factor. In one embodiment the nucleic acid is or comprises<br>
the sequence of a cDNA.<br>
[0035]       Further provided is a variety of nucleic acid constructs comprising one or more inventive<br>
nucleic acids, e.g., a nucleic acid that encodes an antibody heavy chain or light chain, wherein said<br>
nucleic acid was isolated from a cell or cell line that expresses the antibody heavy or light chain using<br>
one or more of the inventive primers. For example, the invention provides vectors, e.g., expression<br>
vectors, containing one or more inventive nucleic acids. In certain embodiments a vector is a binary<br>
vector suitable for Agrobacterium-Tnediatod transformation. In certain embodiments a vector is a<br>
plant virus. In certain embodiments a vector is based on a plant virus, i.e., it contains one or more<br>
genomic components of a plant virus.<br>
[0036]       The invention further provides host cells that express one or more of provided nucleic<br>
acids and produce a heavy or light chain of a monoclonal antibody, or functional fragments thereof.<br>
[0037]        The invention further provides a method of producing an antibody heavy or light chain<br>
comprising: (i) providing an expression system that contains a nucleic acid that encodes a heavy or<br>
light chain of a monoclonal antibody, or a functional fragment thereof, wherein said nucleic acid was<br>
10<br><br>
isolated using oneor more primers of the invention, wherein said nucleic acid is operably linked to a<br>
regulatory element such as a promoter that directs expression of the nucleic acid in the expression<br>
system; (ii) maintaining the expression system under conditions in which expression occurs. The<br>
method may further comprise (iii) harvesting the antibody, or functional fragment thereof. The<br>
antibody or functional fragment thereof may be purified using any of a variety of techniques known in<br>
the art. The expression system can be any suitable expression system, e.g., a cell culture, transgenic<br>
plant or animal, clonal root or plant line, etc. A complete antibody can be produced by allowing the<br>
heavy and light chains to associate with one another.<br>
[0038]       The invention further provides a method of producing an antibody comprising a heavy<br>
chain and a light chain, or functional fragments thereof comprising: (i) providing an expression<br>
system that contains a nucleic acid that encodes an antibody heavy chain or functional fragment<br>
thereof and further contains a nucleic acid that encodes an antibody light chain or functional fragment<br>
thereof, wherein either or both of said nucleic acids was isolated using one or more primers of the<br>
present invention, and wherein each of said nucleic acids is operably linked to a regulatory element<br>
such as a promoter that directs expression in the expression system; (ii) maintaining the expression<br>
system under conditions in which expression occurs. The antibody chains are both produced by the<br>
expression system and can associate with one another in the expression system. The method may<br>
further include a step of harvesting the antibody. Any suitable expression system can be used.<br>
[0039]        The invention further provides a method of treating a subject comprising administering an<br>
antibody comprising a heavy and light chain, or functional fragments thereof, wherein either or both<br>
chains were produced according to an inventive method described herein.<br>

[0041]        The present invention provides novel oligonucleotide primers and primer sets for use in<br>
isolating nucleic acids, e.g., cDNAs. that encode antibody heavy or light chains from hybridomas,<br>
e.g., using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is well known in the art and is described, e.g.,<br>
in PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Dieffenbach, C.W. and Dveksler, G. S. (Eds.); PCR Basics:<br>
From Background to Bench, Springer Verlag, 2000; M. J. McPherson, et ah Mattila et al., Nucleic<br>
Acids Res., 19:4967 (1991); Eclcert et al., PCR Methods and Applications, 1:17 (1991); PCR (eds.<br>
McPherson et al., IRL Press, Oxford); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202.   In certain embodiments of the<br>
invention RNA, e.g., mRNA, is isolated from a cell or from a cell line such as a hybridoma. The<br>
RNA is subjected to reverse transcription to produce cDNA. A nucleic acid that encodes an antibody<br>
heavy or light chain is amplified using one or more oligonucleotide primers or primer sets of the<br>
invention.   The inventive primers can be used for amplification using other amplification techniques<br>
as well.<br>
[0042]       Oligonucleotides of the invention are listed in Table 1, which also indicates the portion of<br>
the antibody gene or cDNA to which the primer hybrizes, e.g., the constant region of a gamma chain<br>
(CG), the constant region of a lambda chain (CL), the constant region of a kappa chain (CK), the<br>
variable region of a heavy chain (VG), the variable region of a lambda chain (VL), or the variable<br>
region of a kappa chain (VK). It will be appreciated that certain primers hybridize to a coding or<br>
noncoding strand, therefore "hybridizes to" is intended to encompass either of these possibilities.<br>
Table 1 also indicates the number of individual sequences available from GenBank which can be<br>
grouped in a "family" which it should be possible to amplify using a particular primer.   Certain of the<br>
primers, indicated as "short" do not contain engineered restriction sites. The other primers, which are<br>
longer, contain a restriction site for Sfil located 5' with respect to the portion that hybridizes to the<br>
antibody gene or cDNA. These primers also contain either CTC or CTCGC at the 5' end to improve<br>
efficiency of cleavage by the restriction enzyme. The invention encompasses additional<br>
oligonucleotides that comprise a portion having the sequence of a "short" primer of Table 1 and<br>
further comprise a restriction site located 5' with respect to the portion having the sequence of a short<br>
primer. The primers that comprise an Sfil site (indicated in bold) provide an example of how the<br>
short primers of the invention can be modified to incorporate a restriction site.<br>
[0043]       Thus in one  aspect, the invention provides an oligonucleotide whose sequence comprises<br>
or consists of any of SEQ ID NOs; 1-44. In another aspect, the invention provides a primer mix<br>
containing at least two oligonucleotides selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs: 1-44. In<br>
another aspect, the invention provides a primer mix containing at least three oligonucleotides selected<br>
from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs: 1-44. In another aspect, the invention provides a primer<br>
mix containing at least four oligonucleotides selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs: 1-<br>
44. In another aspect, the invention provides a primer mix containing at least five oligonucleotides<br>
selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs: 1-44. In another aspect, the invention provides a<br>
12<br><br>
primer mix containing at least six oligonucleotides selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID<br>
NOs: 1-44. In certain embodiments of the invention at least one primer in a primer mix is a constant<br>
region primer and at least one primer in the primer mix is a variable region primer.<br>
[0044]       In some embodiments the primer mix contains at least one primer that hybridizes to a<br>
sequence that encodes at least a portion of the constant region of a gamma chain (a CG primer) and at<br>
least one primer that hybridizes to a sequence that encodes at least a portion of the variable region of a<br>
heavy chain (a VG primer). In some embodiments the primer mix contains at least one primer that<br>
hybridizes to a sequence that encodes at least a portion of the constant region of a lambda chain (a CL<br>
primer) and at least one primer that hybridizes a sequence that encodes at least a portion of the<br>
variable region of a lambda chain (a VL primer). In some embodiments the primer mix contains at<br>
least one primer that hybridizes to a sequence that encodes at least a portion of the constant region of<br>
a kappa chain (a CK) and at least one primer that hybridizes to a sequence that encodes at least a<br>
portion of the variable region of a kappa chain (a VK primer). In some embodiments of the invention<br>
the primer mix contains at least 2 or 3 VG primers and at least one CG primer. In some embodiments<br>
of the invention the primer mix contains at least 2 or 3 VL primers and at least one CL primer. In<br>
some embodiments of the invention the primer mix contains at least 2 or 3 VK primers and at least<br>
one CK primer. In any of the foregoing embodiments, the primers may be short or long.   In some<br>
embodiments of the invention a first PCR reaction is performed using a primer set or pair of short<br>
primers and a second PCR reaction is performed suing a primer set or pair or primers that contain a<br>
restriction site (long primers). The long primers may comprise a sequence of a short primer as<br>
described in Example 1.<br><br>

[0046]        It will be appreciated that the sequences listed in Table 1 represent either i<br>
oligonucleotide molecule having the listed sequence or a population of oligonucleotidt<br>
15<br><br>
each of which has the listed sequence. Certain of the primers listed in Table 1 are degenerate, i.e., the<br>
population of oligonucleotide molecules represented by the sequence contains individual members<br>
whose sequence differs at the degenerate position. The term "position" refers to a numerical value<br>
that is assigned to each nucleoside in a polynucleotide, generally with respect to the 5' end.<br>
[0047]        The concept of degenerate primers is well known in the art and is used herein consistently<br>
with the understanding in the art. Table 2 contains the IUPAC ambiguity code, which lists<br>
abbreviations that represent the nucleotides that may be present at a degenerate position. For<br>
example, K represents G or T.<br>
16<br><br><br>
[0048]       Table 2: Ambiguity Code<br>
[0049]        If there are "N" possible nucleotides at a given position in an oligonucleotide, the position<br>
is said to be N-fold degenerate. Thus primer sequence "CG", i.e., 5'-<br>
CTCGCGGCCTCCGAGGCCTCATTTACCCKGAGACAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 1) represents a<br>
population of oligonucleotides containing some members in which position 29 is occupied by a G and<br>
some members in which position 29 is occupied by a T. The invention includes oligonucleotides in<br>
which the degenerate position is occupied by any of the alternatives possible at that position. For<br>
example, the invention encompasses an oligonucleotide having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1,<br>
wherein position 29 is occupied by a G and also encompassess an oligonucleotide having the<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein position 29 is occupied by a T. All possibilities are<br>
encompassed. For example, primer "VG1+7 short" (SEQ ID NO: 13) is 2-fold degenerate at positions<br>
9 and 11. Thus the invention encompasses 4 non-degenerate variants of SEQ ID NO: 13 in addition<br>
to encompassing the degenerate oligonucleotide represented by SEQ 3D NO: 13, which contains<br>
oligonucleotide molecules having any of 4 different sequences. The invention also encompasses<br>
embodiments in which fewer of the positions are degenerate than indicated in Table 1. For example,<br>
the invention encompasses embodiments in which only position 9 of SEQ ID NO: 13 is degenerate<br>
(and position 11 is either of the nucleotides represented by Y) and embodiments in which only<br>
position 11 of SEQ ID NO: 13 is degenerate (and position 9 is either of the oligonucleotides<br>
represented by S).<br>
[0050]        The proportion of the different oligonucleotides in the oligonucleotide population of a<br>
degenerate oligonucleotide can vary. Typically each sequence is represented approximately equally<br>
17<br><br>
in the population. However, it may be desirable to bias the composition of the mixture. Any specific<br>
percentage composition of a degenerate oligonucleotide listed in Table 1 is within the scope of the<br>
invention. The overall degeneracy of an oligonucleotide is the total number of different sequences<br>
that may be present in the oligonucleotide population. For example, if there are 3 degenerate<br>
positions, each of which is 2-fold degenerate, the degeneracy of the oligonucleotide population is 23 =<br>
8.<br>
Expression Systems and Antibody Production<br>
[0051]       A nucleic acid encoding an antibody heavy or light chain isolated using any of the<br>
inventive oligonucleotide primers can be expressed in any of a wide variety of expression systems.<br>
An expression system is any suitable biological system such as a cell line or transgenic animal or<br>
plant capable of synthesizing a polypeptide. Typically the nucleic acid is inserted into an expression<br>
vector of which a wide variety are known. Suitable methods for expressing a polynucleotide of<br>
interest are known in the art and are described in Ausubel, supra, and in Sambrook, supra. See also,<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and 6,331,415. Any prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression system can be<br>
used. In certain embodiments of the invention the expression system is not a hybridoma and is not a<br>
human being, i.e., the expression system is one that does not naturally produce the antibody chain.<br>
[0052]        In certain embodiments of the invention a plant-based expression system is used. A<br>
plant-based expression system is any expression system that employs cells of a plant or portion<br>
thereof. The expression system may be a plant cell line, whole plant, clonal root line, etc. The plant<br>
cell line, whole plant, clonal root line, etc., and may be transgenic or non-transgenic.<br>
[0053]       Methods and vectors for expressing a polynucleotide of interest, e.g, an antibody heavy or<br>
light chain in a plant-based expression system are well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,852,319. In certain embodiments of the invention a vector based on a plant viral genome is used.<br>
Without limitation, the invention encompasses the use of any vector based on a plant virus or viral<br>
genome, e.g., an RNA plant virus or viral genome, a DNA plant virus or viral genome, etc. See, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Pat, Nos. 5,602,242, 5,500,360, and 5,846,795.<br>
[0054]       In certain embodiments of the invention transgenic or nontransgenic sprouts are used as<br>
an expression system. See, e.g,. U.S.Pub. No. 20040093643 and U.S.S.N. 60/652,186, filed February<br>
11, 2005, entitled "Production of Foreign Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides in Sprout Systems" by<br>
Ensley, et al. In certain embodiments of the invention a clonal root line or other clonal line is used.<br>
See, e.g., U.S.S.N. 11/061,980, filed Feb.18, 2005, entitled "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR<br>
CLONAL EXPRESSION IN PLANTS". Other patent applications containing relevant information<br>
for expressing a polynucleotide of interest include U.S. Pub. Nos. 20050026291, 20050114920,<br>

[0055]       The present invention expressly contemplates the expression of a nucleic acid that<br>
encodes a light chain or heavy chain of an antibody, wherein said nucleic acid is isolated using a<br>
method and/or primer disclosed herein using the expression systems and methods described in or<br>
referenced in any of the patent applications and publications listed in this section. Any specific plant,<br>
plant virus, plant viral replicon, etc., described therein can be used. In some embodiments the viral<br>
replicon contains sufficient sequence elements that it can be replicated in a plant cell, optionally<br>
utilizing components such as an RNA polymerase supplied by the plant in trans (e.g., the plant is<br>
transgenic or comprises another vector that expressed the RNA polymerase). The replicon may or<br>
may not include a coat protein gene or movement protein gene. Any particular method of introducing<br>
a plant virus or replicon into a plant or plant cell or plant part can be used. Examples include<br>
application to a plant part such as a leaf, abrasion (e.g., to introduce a viral transcript into a leaf),<br>
agroinfiltration, Agi-obacterium-mediated transformation, biolistics, etc. The invention encompasses<br>
any plant viral vector or replicon that comprises a nucleic acid isolated according to a method   -<br>
described herein, e.g, a recombinant plant viral vector or replicon, and further encompasses a plant,<br>
plant part, or clonal culture derived from a plant, comprising the vector. The invention further<br>
encompasses a transgenic plant whose genome comprises the nucleic acid.<br>
[0056]       In some embodiments of the invention nucleic acid sequences that encode a heavy chain<br>
and a light chain are co-expressed so that the chains can associate with one another to form a complete<br>
antibody prior to harvest.<br>
[0057]       Any suitable method can be used to harvest and optionally purify an antibody chain or<br>
antibody produced according to the inventive methods.<br>
[0058]        Of course a heavy or light chain of an antibody can also be chemically synthesized.<br>
Having the nucleotide sequence that encodes the heavy or light chain provides the amino acid<br>
sequence.<br>
[0059]        A nucleic acid encoding an antibody heavy or light chain isolated using any of the<br>
inventive oligonucleotide primers can be modified in any of a variety of ways. For example, it may<br>
be modified so as to disrupt a glycosylation event or other post-translational processing event that<br>
would otherwise occur in eukaryotic cells. For example, a mutation that alters an amino acid that<br>
would be glycosylated or an adjacent or nearby site may be made. As is well known in the art, Asn-<br>
X~(Ser/Thr) is a sequence that can be recognized by eukaryotic W-linked glycosylation machinery.<br>
The particular site(s) to be modified may be selected taking into account the particular glycosylation<br>
machinery found in the expression system to be used. It may be modified to include a portion that<br>
encodes a polypeptide tag (e.g., to facilitate purification), a sequence that targets the antibody chain to<br>
a particular organelle, etc. A wide variety of alterations may be employed without interfering with the<br>
specific antigen binding properties of the antibody and are within the scope of the invention. In<br>
19<br><br>
certain embodiments the alteration(s) result in an antibody that is at least 80% identical, at least 85%<br>
identical, at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical in sequence to the naturally occurring antibody.<br>
[0060]        An antibody produced according to the methods of the invention may be an antibody<br>
fragment such as an Fab', F(ab')2, scFv (single-chain variable) or other fragment that retains an<br>
antigen binding site. The fragment may either be expressed as a fragment, i,e., a nucleic acid that<br>
encodes only the fragment may be expressed, or a complete antibody can be processed to produce a<br>
fragment using known techniques, e.g., cleavage or digestion.<br>
Vectors<br>
[0061]       As mentioned above, a cDNA isolated using the inventive primers and methods can be<br>
inserted into a wide variety of vectors and expressed in a wide variety of cell types and expression<br>
systems. The invention provides additional vectors suitable for insertion of a nucleic acid isolated<br>
using the inventive primers that comprise a restriction site. The vector contains the same restriction<br>
site as present in the primers. The restriction site is present at one or more locations in the vector. In<br>
some embodiments a restriction site at an undesired location of the vector is removed, e.g., using site-<br>
directed mutagenesis. In some embodiments the restriction site is a restriction site for Sfil.<br>
[0062]        In a specific embodiment the invention provides a modified version of the binary vector<br>
pBI121, suitable for Agrobacterium-modiated transformation, in which the internal Sfil site at<br>
position 11031 is mutagenized and in which one or more new sites for Sfil is created.   Briefly,<br>
pBI121 carries the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) gene and a-glucuronidase (GUS) gene<br>
(Jefferson et ah, EMBOJ, 6: 3901-3907,1987). The neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) gene is<br>
under the control of the nopaline synthase {nos) promoter and the terminator from nopaline synthase<br>
(nos) which provides polyadenylation signal. The neomycin phosphotransferase {NPTII) gene confers<br>
kanamycin resistance. The a-glucuronidase (GUS) activity is under the control of the cauliflower<br>
mosaic virus 35S promoter and the terminator from nopaline synthase (nos) provides polyadenylation.<br>
The invention provides a modified form of pBI121 in which the original Sfil site is mutagenized and<br>
in which two new Sfil sites are introduced to allow for convenient insertion of a heterologous nucleic<br>
acid such as a nucleic acid that encodes an antibody heavy or light chain.<br>
Kits<br>
[0063]       The invention provides a kit comprising one or more oligonucleotides listed in Table 1.<br>
Preferably the kit contains at least two oligonucleotides. In specific embodiments the kit contains at<br>
least any number of oligonucleotides between 3 and 44. In general, the kit contains a pair or set of<br>
oligonucleotides suitable for amplifying a nucleic acid that encodes a heavy chain, e.g., a gamma<br>
heavy chain, and/or a pair or set of oligonucleotides suitable for amplifying a nucleic acid that<br>
encodes a light chain, e.g., a kappa or lambda light chain. In some embodiments the kit contains a<br>
20<br><br>
pair or set of oligonucleotides suitable for amplifying a gamma heavy chain, a pair or set of<br>
oligonucleotides suitable for amplifying a kappa light chain, and a pair or set of oligonucleotides<br>
suitable for amplifying a lambda light chain. Any pair or set of oligonucleotides described above can<br>
be included in the kit. The kit will typically include instructions for using the kit to isolate nucleic<br>
acids that encode one or more chains of an antibody from a cell or cell line such as a hybridoma.<br>
[0064]       In addition to one or more oligonucleotides, the kit may further comprise any of a number<br>
of additional reagents. For example, the kit may contain reagents for performing a PCR reaction, e.g.,<br>
an RT-PCR reaction. The kit may therefore contain, e.g., a reverse transcriptase, a thermostable<br>
DNA polymerase, nucleotides, buffers, etc. The kit may contain reagents for purifying RNA from a<br>
hybridoma or other cellular source of RNA.<br>
[0065]        The kit may contain one or more vectors into which a nucleic acid amplified using the kit<br>
can be inserted. The vector may be an expression vector that contains regulatory elements, e.g., a<br>
promoter, sufficient to direct expression in a cell, e.g., a plant cell, bacterial cell, fungal cell, insect<br>
cell, mammalian cell, etc. Other appropriate elements such as transcriptional terminators, etc., can<br>
also be included. A wide variety of expression vectors are available in the art, and any of these can be<br>
included in the kit. In one embodiment the vector is a binary vector suitable for Agrobacterium-<br>
mediated transformation.<br>
[0066]        The vector may contain one or more convenient restriction sites such that cleavage of the<br>
vector with a restriction enzyme results in a "sticky end" that is compatible with, i.e., hybridizes to, a<br>
restriction site present in one or more of the oligonucleotide primers present in the kit. In some<br>
embodiments the vector contains one or more restriction sites for an enzyme that recognizes an 8<br>
nucleotide recognition site. The 8 nucleotides may be continuous or may be separated by one or more<br>
other nucleotides (e.g., 1-10 nucleotides) that are not specifically recognized, though the spacing may<br>
be essential for recognition. For example, in certain embodiments the enzyme cuts within<br>
XXXXNNNNNXXXX, where N stands for any nucleotide and X stands for any specific nucleotide<br>
(i.e., each X is independently selected).   Such sites can be advantageous as they allow one to perform<br>
directional cloning using only one enzyme by having a different sequence of 5 nucleotides at the 5'-<br>
and 3'-ends of the insert. In some embodiments the vector contains one or more restriction sites for<br>
Sfil, which cuts within the site GGCCNNNNNGGCC. The vector can be provided in linearized or<br>
circular form. A restriction enzyme for cleaving the vector may also be provided. Reagents for<br>
performing a ligation, e.g., ligase, ligase buffer, etc., can be included.<br>
[0067]        An identifier, e.g., a bar code, radio frequency ID tag, etc., may be present in or on the kit.<br>
The identifier can be used, e.g., to uniquely identify the kit for purposes of quality control, inventory<br>
control, tracking, movement between workstations, etc.<br>
[0068]       Kits will generally include one or more vessels or containers so that certain of the<br>
individual reagents may be separately housed. The kits may also include a means for enclosing the<br>
21<br><br>
individual containers in relatively close confinement for commercial sale, e.g., a plastic box, in which<br>
instructions, packaging materials such as styrofoam, etc., may be enclosed.<br>
Nucleotide Sequences Encoding Human Monoclonal Antibodies to Anthrax Antigens and Isolated<br>
Heavy and Light Chains<br>
[0069]       As described in more detail in Example 1, the primers listed in Table 1 were used to<br>
isolate cDNA sequences encoding the gamma heavy chain and the kappa light chain of two different<br>
human monoclonal antibodies (huMAbs).  Isolation of these cDNAs is exemplary of the use of the<br>
oligonucleotide primers of the invention. One of the huMAbs specifically binds to domain 4 of the<br>
Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) polypeptide, designated PA-1. The other huMAb<br>
specifically binds to the Bacillus anthracis lethal factor (LF) polypeptide, designated LF-1. Bacillus<br>
anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax. The roles of PA and LF in bacterial pathogenesis and in<br>
the immune response are well known in the art. cDNA sequences were isolated from hybridoma cell<br>
lines that were obtained by fusing lymphocytes from an individual who had received an anthrax<br>
vaccination with myeloma cells and screening for antibodies specific for B. anthracis using standard<br>
methods.<br>
[0070]        Provided are isolated nucleic acids comprising a DNA sequence of the PA-1 huMAb<br>
Kappa light chain cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 45), a DNA sequence of PA-1 huMAb Gamma heavy chain<br>
cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 47), a DNA sequence of LF-1 huMAb Kappa light chain cDNA (SEQ ID NO:<br>
49), or a DNA sequence of LF-1 huMAb Gamma heavy chain cDNA (SEQ ID NO: 51). The<br>
invention also provides corresponding RNA sequences, in which T is replaced by U.<br>
[0071]       The invention also provides an isolated polypeptide encoded by any one of SEQ ID NOs<br>
45, 47, 49, or 51. The ammo acid sequences of these polypeptides are set forth in SEQ ID NOs 46,<br>
48, 50, and 52. The invention also provides an isolated polypeptide that is at least 80%, at least 85%.<br>
at least 90%, at least 95%, or more identical to a polypeptide of SEQ ID NOs 46, 48, 50, or 52. The<br>
invention also provides antibody compositions in which one or more of SEQ ID NOs 45,47,49, or 51<br>
is expressed in an expression system other than a hybridoma or human being.<br>

Antibody Compositions and Delivery Vehicles and Methods<br>
[0098]        The invention provides antibody compositions comprising one or more antibodies<br>
prepared according to the methods of the invention. An "antibody composition" refers to a<br>
composition comprising one or more antibodies or functional fragment(s) thereof and, optionally, any<br>
components of the production system that are not removed during the process of purifying the<br>
antibody. Thus it will be appreciated that a first antibody composition comprising an antibody or<br>
functional fragment thereof prepared by expressing a cDNA isolated using the oligonucleotide<br>
primers of the invention in an expression system of choice, e.g., a plant-based expression system, may<br>
not be identical to a second antibody composition comprising the same antibody wherein the second<br>
antibody composition is prepared using a different expression system. For example, an antibody<br>
composition comprising an antibody produced by a hybridoma maintained in tissue culture may<br>
contain residual components found in the tissue culture medium, whereas an antibody produced using<br>
a plant-based expression system would generally not contain certain of these components. Thus in<br>
certain embodiments the antibody compositions of the invention are distinct from other antibody<br>
compositions containing the same antibody or antibodies.<br>
[0099]        In some embodiments one or more antibodies prepared according to the methods of the<br>
invention is provided in a pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration to a subject for<br>
diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes, where "therapeutic purposes" are understood to include<br>
prophylactic purposes (i.e., administration before any sign or symptom of a disease or condition has<br>
occurred) and treatment purposes (i.e., adminstration after one or more signs or symptoms of a disease<br>
or condition has occurred). Antibodies of the invention may, without limitation, be used<br>
diagnosticaly, prophylactically, and/or for treatment of infectious diseases (e.g., bacterial, viral,<br>
fungal, or parasitic disease), cancer (which term encompasses carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphoma,<br>
leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, benign tumors, etc.), inflammatory conditions, disorders<br>
characterized by undesirable angiogenesis, transplant rejection, graft vs host disease, etc. Other<br>
applications for antibodies of the invention include in vitro immunodepletion of undesired cells such<br>
as cancer cells, lymphocytes, etc.   The antibodies can also be used to target other agents (e.g., a<br>
diagnostic or therapeutic agent) to a site in the body where the antigen recognized by the antibody is<br>
expressed.<br>
32<br><br>
[00100]     Suitable preparations, e.g., substantially pure preparations of the antibodies may be<br>
combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, solvents, etc., to produce an appropriate<br>
pharmaceutical composition.   The invention therefore provides a variety of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions for administration to a subject comprising (i) an antbody; and (ii) a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. It is to be understood that the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, when administered to a subject, are preferably<br>
administered for a time and in an amount sufficient to treat or prevent the disease or condition for<br>
whose treatment or prevention they are administered.<br>
[00101]     In various embodiments of the invention an effective amount of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition is administered to a subject by any suitable route of administration including, but not<br>
limited to, intravenous, intramuscular, by inhalation, by catheter, intraocularly, orally, rectally,<br>
intradermally, by application to the skin, etc.<br>
[00102]     Inventive compositions may be formulated for delivery by any available route including,<br>
but not limited to parenteral, oral, by inhalation to the lungs, nasal, bronchial, opthalmic, transdermal<br>
(topical), transmucosal, rectal, and vaginal routes. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes<br>
subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal,<br>
intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
[00103]     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle" refers to a non-toxic<br>
carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle that does not destroy the pharmacological activity of the compound with<br>
which it is formulated. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that may be used<br>
in the compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina,<br>
aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as<br>
phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable<br>
fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate,<br>
potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates. waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers,<br>
polyethylene glycol and wool fat. Solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical<br>
administration may be included. Supplementary active compounds, e.g., compounds independently<br>
active against the disease or clinical condition to be treated, or compounds that enhance activity of a<br>
compound, can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
[0001]        Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those<br>
derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of<br>
suitable acid salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate,<br>
butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopcntanepropionate. digluconate, dodecylsulfate,<br>
33<br><br>
ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate,<br>
heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate,<br>
maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, palmoate,<br>
pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate,<br>
succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and imdecanoate. Other acids, such as oxalic, while<br>
not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as<br>
intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts.<br>
[0002]       Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium and potassium),<br>
alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium andN+(Cl-4 alkyl)4 salts. This invention also<br>
envisions the quatemization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed<br>
herein. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quatemization.<br>
[00104]     A pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of<br>
administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral (e.g., intravenous), intramuscular,<br>
intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such<br>
as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or<br>
other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants<br>
such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid;<br>
buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as<br>
sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or<br>
sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or<br>
multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
[00105]     Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use typically include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation<br>
of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include<br>
physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, NJ), phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS), or Ringer's solution.<br>
[00106]      Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For<br>
this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty<br>
acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are<br>
natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their<br>
polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol<br>
diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly<br>
used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and<br>
suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents<br>
34<br><br>
or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.<br>
[00107] In all cases, the composition should be sterile, if possible, and should be fluid to the<br>
extent that easy syringability exists.<br>
[00108]     Preferred pharmaceutical formulations are stable under the conditions of manufacture and<br>
storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria<br>
and fungi. In general, the relevant carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for<br>
example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene<br>
glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for<br>
example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in<br>
the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can<br>
be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol,<br>
phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic<br>
agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the<br>
composition. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in<br>
the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Prolonged absorption of oral compositions can be achieved by various means including encapsulation.<br>
[00109]      Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the<br>
required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated<br>
above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Preferably solutions for injection are free of<br>
endotoxin. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile<br>
vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those<br>
enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the<br>
preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the<br>
active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution<br>
thereof.<br>
[00110]      Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose<br>
of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used<br>
in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be<br>
prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents,<br>
and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules,<br>
troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a<br>
binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or<br>
lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as<br>
magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as<br>
sucrose oi saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate. or orange flavoring.<br>
35<br><br>
Formulations for oral delivery may advantageously incorporate agents to improve stability within the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and/or to enhance absorption.<br>
[00111]     For administration by inhalation, the inventive compositions are preferably delivered in<br>
the form of an aerosol spray from a pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable<br>
propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Liquid or dry aerosol (e.g., dry powders,<br>
large porous particles, etc.) can be used. The present invention also contemplates delivery of<br>
compositions using a nasal spray.<br>
[00112] For topical applications, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be<br>
formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or<br>
more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene,<br>
polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active<br>
components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable<br>
carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters<br>
wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2Doctyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
[00113] For local delivery to the eye, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be<br>
formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as<br>
solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
[00114]     The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be administered<br>
by nasal aerosol or inhalation.  Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known<br>
in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl<br>
alcohol   or   other   suitable   preservatives,   absorption   promoters   to   enhance   bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.<br>
[00115]      Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For<br>
transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are<br>
used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for<br>
transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal<br>
administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal<br>
administration, the antibodies are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally<br>
known in the art.<br>
[00116]     The antibody compositions can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with<br>
conventional suppository' bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for<br>
rectal delivery.<br>
36<br><br>
[00117]     In addition to the agents described above, in certain embodiments of the invention, the<br>
antibody compositions are prepared with carriers that will protect the antibodies against rapid<br>
elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and<br>
microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, polyethers, and<br>
poly lactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art.   Certain of the materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova<br>
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example,<br>
as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811 and other references listed herein. Liposomes, including<br>
targeted liposomes (e.g., antibody targeted liposomes) and pegylated liposomes have been described<br>
(Hansen CB, et al., Biochim BiophysActa. 1239(2):133-44,1995; Torchilin VP, et al., Biochim<br>
BiophysActa, 1511(2):397-411, 2001; IshidaT, et al., FEBS Lett. 460(l):129-33, 1999). One of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the materials and methods selected for preparation of a<br>
controlled release formulation, implant, etc., should be such as to retain activity of the antibody. For<br>
example, it may be desirable to avoid excessive heating of polypeptides such as antibodies, which<br>
could lead to denaturation and loss of activity.<br>
[00118]      It is typically advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit<br>
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to<br>
physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of antibody calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association<br>
with the required pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
[00119]      Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compositions can be determined by standard<br>
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50<br>
(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of<br>
the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it<br>
can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ EDso- Compositions which exhibit high therapeutic indices are<br>
preferred. While compositions that exhibit toxic side effects can be used, care should be taken to<br>
design a delivery system that targets such compositions to the site of affected tissue in order to<br>
minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
[00120]     The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating<br>
a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage lies preferably within a range of circulating<br>
concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range<br>
depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any antibody<br>
or other compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be<br>
estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a<br>
37<br><br>
circulating plasma concentration range that includes the ED50 as determined in cell culture. Such<br>
information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can<br>
be measured, for example, by high performance liquid cnromatography.<br>
[00121]     A therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition typically ranges from<br>
about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more<br>
preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9<br>
mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The pharmaceutical composition<br>
can be administered at various intervals and over different periods of time as required, e.g., multiple<br>
times per day, daily, every other day, once a week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, between 2 to 8<br>
weeks, between about 3 to 7 weeks, about 4, 5, or 6 weeks, etc. The skilled artisan will appreciate<br>
that certain factors can influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject,<br>
including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general<br>
health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Generally, treatment of a subject with an<br>
inventive composition can include a single treatment or, in many cases, can include a series of<br>
treatments. It will be appreciated that a range of different dosage combinations (i.e., doses of two or<br>
more antibodies or one or more antibodies and one or more additional active agents) can be used.<br>
[00122]     Exemplary doses include milligram or microgram amounts of the antibodies per kilogram<br>
of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per<br>
kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1<br>
microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram.)  For local administration (e.g.,<br>
intranasal), doses much smaller than these may be used. It is furthermore understood that appropriate<br>
doses depend upon the potency of the agent, and may optionally be tailored to the particular recipient,<br>
for example, through administration of increasing doses until a preselected desired response is<br>
achieved. It is understood that the specific dose level for any particular subject may depend upon a<br>
variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight,<br>
general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the tune of administration, the route of administration,<br>
the rate of excretion, any drug combination, and the degree of expression or activity to be modulated.<br>
[00123]      The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising two or more<br>
antibodies of the invention and, optionally, one or more additional active agents.<br>
Examples<br>
[00124]     The below Examples describe cDNAs were cloned from human hybridoma cell lines<br>
which produce antibodies which specifically bind B. anthracis PA or LF protein. cDNAs for the<br>
- human heavy and light chain of monoclonal antibody specifically recognizing PA (designated herein<br>
PA) or LF (designated herein LF) were isolated from hybridoma cell lines which were generated from<br>
cells isolated from a human patient immunized with a licensed anthrax vaccine.<br>
38<br><br>
Example 1: Isolation of cDNAs that Encode Human Monoclonal Antibodies from Hybridomas<br>
[00125]     This example describes use of certain of the oligonucleotide primers listed in Table 1 to<br>
isolate cDNAs encoding human monoclonal antibodies. All kits were used according to the<br>
manufacturer's directions.<br>
[00126]     RNA-purification from hybridoma cell lines.<br>
[00127]     Total RNA was purified from 105 cells of any given hybridoma cell line using the RNeasy<br>
Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA was cluted in 50 ill water (no yield was calculated) and 5 ul was used in<br>
each RT-PCR reaction.<br>
[00128]     Reverse Transcription-PCR.<br>
[00129]     The primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Table 1. RT-PCR was performed with<br>
Superscript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). To efficiently target<br>
all possible variable regions in any given heavy or light chain sequence a combination of primers<br>
were used for each RT-PCR reaction and several RT-PCR reactions were performed simultaneously<br>
for amplification of each antibody gene.<br>
[00130]     For heavy chains, 2 uM each of the primers VG1+7 short, VG2 short and VG3 short were<br>
combined with 2 uM of the constant gamma short (CG short) primer in one reaction and 2 uM each of<br>
the primers VG4-short, VG5-short and VG6-short were combined with 2 uM of the constant gamma<br>
short (CG-short) primer in a second reaction. Any product was then purified using Qiaex II (Qiagen)<br>
and, if the product came from the first initial reaction, re-amplified with 2 uM each of the primers<br>
VG1, VG2, and VG3 in combinations with 2 uM of primer CG, or, if the product came from the<br>
second RT-PCR reaction, re-amplified with 2 uM each of the primers VG4, VG5, and VG6 in<br>
combinations with 2 uM of primer CG using Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen) to<br>
introduce different 5' and 3' Sfi I restriction sites.<br>
[00131]     For light chains, the RT-PCR product yield was always sufficient for immediate<br>
subcloning of the product, thus eliminating the need for an initial RT-PCR reaction with short<br>
primers. Instead 2 uM each of three variable region primers were combined with 2 uM of the constant<br>
region primer (Table 1), resulting in three separate reactions for lambda and two separate reactions for<br>
kappa light chains. Specifically, the reactions contained 2 or 3 variable primers, as follows:<br>
CK + VKl,2+1.8and3<br>
CK + VK4and5<br>
CL + VLl,2and3<br>
CL + VL4, 5 and 6+9<br>
CL + VL7 and 10+8<br>
It will be appreciated that other combinations could have been used.<br>
[00132]     PCR cycling conditions were adapted from Krebber, A., Bornhauser, S., Burmester, L,<br>
Honegger, A., Wiliuda, J., Bosshard, H.R., and Pluckthun, A. (1997). Reliable cloning of functional<br>
39<br><br>
antibody variable domains from hybridomas and spleen cell repertoires employing a reengineered<br>
phage display system. JImmunol Methods 201, 35-55. For RT-PCR the cycling conditions were as<br>
follows: 30 min at 45 °C, 2 min at 94 °C; seven cycles of: 1 min at 94 CCJ 30 sec at 63 °C, 50 sec at 58<br>
°C, 3 min at 72 °C, and 33 cycles of: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C5 followed by 7<br>
min at 72 °C. For regular PCR (not RT-PCR) the initial steps of 30 min at 45 °C and 2 min at 94 °C<br>
were omitted.<br>
[00133]     The amplification products were cloned into the binary vector pBISfi, whose construction<br>
is described in Example 2.<br>
Example 2: Construction of vector pBISfi<br>
[00134]     This example describes modification of the binary vector pBI121 to facilitate its use for<br>
expression of antibodies in plants. First, the internal Sfi I site at 11031 bp of vector pBI121 was<br>
mutagenized as follows: the vector was digested with Sfi I and the resulting single stranded overhangs<br>
were filled in using Klenow and the resulting blunt ends were re-ligated. To create a 5' unique Sfi I<br>
site the oligonucleotides BamSfi 1 (5&gt;-GATCCGGCCCAGCCGGCCG-3'; SEQ ID NO: 53) and<br>
BamSfi 2 (5'-GATCCGGCCGGCTGGGCCG-3'; SEQ ID NO: 54) were annealed to each other and<br>
ligated into the BamH I site of the vector pBI121 (lacking the internal Sfi I site). Similarly, annealing<br>
oligonucleotides SacSfi 1 (5'-GCCTCGGGGGCCGAGCT-3'; SEQ ID NO: 55) and SacSfi 2 (5'-<br>
GCCCCCGAGGCCGAGCT-3'; SEQ ID NO: 56) and ligating into the Sac I site of pBI121 (lacking<br>
the internal Sfi I site) created a 3' unique Sfi I site.<br>
Example 3: Mutagenesis ofcDNA Encoding PA antibody heavy chain.<br>
[00135J     The cDNA that encodes the PA gamma chain was mutagenized using Invitrogen's<br>
GeneTailor kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations so as to alter the iV-glycosylation<br>
site at position 318 of the PA gamma chain. The following mutant primer was used: 5'-<br>
ccgcgggaggagcagtacCAAagcacgtaccgt-3' (SEQ ID NO: 57). The reverse primer was:<br>
gtactgctcctcccgcggctttgtcttggca (SEQ ID NO: 58) As a result of the mutagenesis, the AAC codon was<br>
replaced by a CAA codon. resulting in an Asn-&gt;GIn alteration.<br>
Example 4: Production of Glycosylated and Nongfycosylated PA antibody in plants.<br>
[00136]     Glycosylated and non-glycosylated PA antibody (PA and PANG, respectively) were<br>
purified from the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana plants after agro-infiltration with a 1:1 mixture of<br>
Agrobacterial cultures carrying light or heavy chain cDNAs under the 35S promoter in pBISfil. The<br>
antibodies were purified using protein A- and T-gel chromatography and compared using SDS-PAGE.<br>
Figure 1 shows an image of the gel, which clearly demonstrates a difference in the electrophoretic<br>
mobility of PANG heavy chains due to the lack of glycosylation, i.e., the PANG heavy chain migrates<br>
40<br><br>
faster than the PA~Eeavy chain since it is lighter. Western blot and ELISA analysis confirmed the<br>
specific binding activity of PA, PANG and LF antibodies for PA and LF, respectively, indicating that<br>
production in plants did not impair the specificity of antibody binding.<br>
Example 5: Half-life Study ofanti-PA and anti-LF Human Monoclonal Antibodies in Rats<br>
[00137]     Male Fischer rats were injected intraperitoneally with 50ug of either plant produced PA,<br>
plant produced PANG, or plant produced LF. Serum samples were taken pre-injection, as well as at<br>
2hrs, and at 1,2,3,4,5,10,15, and 20 days post-injection. Serum was analyzed with either PA- or LF-<br>
specific binding ELISA. Plant produced PA and PANG showed similar half-lifes, while LF<br>
antibodies had somewhat lower half life as compared to both plant produced PA antibodies.<br>
Example 6: Animal Protection Studies<br>
[00138]     The ability of plant produced PA to protect A/J mice against challenge with spores of the<br>
Sterne strain of B. anthracis was determined according to the method of Beedham and colleagues. A<br>
group of five mice were given 180u.g of plant produced PA mAb by intraperitoneal route in PBS.<br>
Control mice received PBS. 2.5 hours after passive immunization, animals received spores of B.<br>
anthracis at a dose of 1 X 104 spores in Q.lmL of PBS (approximately 30 median lethal dose).<br>
Following challend, animals were monitored daily for 14 days for evidence of morbidity or mortality.<br>
Animals receiving plant produced mAb did not develop disease symptoms, remained healthy, and<br>
survived the challenge, while all the control animals developed disease and died within 3 days post-<br>
challenge.<br>
