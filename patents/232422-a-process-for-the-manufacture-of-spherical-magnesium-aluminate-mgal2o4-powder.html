				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of spherical magnesium aluminate (MgAI204) powder This invention particularly relates to a process for the manufacture of spherical magnesium aluminate (MgAI204) powder from water-based sols.<br>
MgAl2O4 spinel is known to be used as an important ceramic material:, because of its high melting point (2135°C), high resistance against chemical attack, superior mechanical strength both at room temperature and elevated temperature, low dielectric constant and excellent optical characteristics. It also finds applications as a sensing element for humidity measurement devices in the form of porous compacts. Dense spinel ceramics find potential application in diverse engineering fields. The spherical morphology of the powder exhibits good flowability characteristics and can be useded for making monolothic refractories. It also helps in rapid die filling during the preparation of spinel ceramics.<br>
The present day methods of preparing MgAl2O4 powders mainly consists of solution phase reactions. Reference may be made to R. J. Bratton in "Am. Ceram. Soc. Bull. 48 (1969) pp 759-62" wherein a mixed solution of magnesium and aluminium chloride was prepared (Mg2+/A13+ = 1:2) by dissolving 0.5 moles of MgCI2.6H2O and 1 mole of A1C13.6 H2O per litre of distilled water at 80°C. The chloride solution was then added to a stirred excess solution of ammonium hydroxide. The pH of the solution was maintained between 9.5-10 during precipitation. The gelatinous precipitate was kept at about 80°C for 1/2 h followed by cooling to room temperature, washed and dried slowly at 100°C.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above process are: (i) It suffers lack of homogeneity, (ii) Crystallization temperature is high.<br><br>
Reference may also be made to J.-G. Li, T. Ikegami, J.-H. Lee, T. Mori and Y. Yajima in "J. Eur. Ceram. Soc. 21 (2001) pp 139-148" wherein spinel precursor was made by adding 400 mL of the mixed solution of aluminium nitrate nonahydrate and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate at a speed of 5 mL/min into 600 mL of the ammonium bicarbonate solution under stirring followed by ageing the precipitate at the reaction temperatures of 50°C in a suspension of pH 1 1.07. The precipitate after washing with ethanol was dried at room temperature and subsequently calcined at different temperature under flowing oxygen.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above process are:<br>
(i) Precursor precipitate consists of several phases which at high temperature produces spinel phase. (ii) Calcination at various temperatures is carried out under flowing oxygen (100 ml/min).<br>
Reference may also be made to R. K. Pati and P. Pramanik in "J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 83 (2000) pp 1822-1824" wherein nanocrystalline (10-20 nm) MgAl2O4 spinel powder was synthesized by the pyrolysis of complex compounds of aluminium and magnesium with triethanolamine (TEA). Aluminium nitrate nonahydrate, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate and TEA were used as the starting materials. The soluble metal ion-TEA complexes formed the precursor material on complete dehydration of the complexes of aluminium-TEA and magnesium-TEA. When complete dehydration occurs, the nitrates themselves are decomposed with the evolution of brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide, leaving behind a voluminous, organic-based, black, fluffy powder, i.e. precursor powder. The precursor powders after grinding are calcined at 650°C and above to obtain MgAl2O4 powders.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above process are: (i) The experimental procedure involves too many steps. (ii) Crystallization temperature is high, about 675°C.<br><br>
Reference may further be made to Z. Nakagawa, K. Hamano, M. Sakaguchi and S. Kanzaki in "Yogyo-Kyokai-Shi, 90 (1982) pp. 313-319" wherein a freeze-dried mixed sulphate precursor was prepared from an aqueous solution of Mg- and Al-sulphates. The mixed sulphate precursor was then calcined at 900° - 1400°C/lh. During this heat-treatment, the mixed sulphate completely decomposed and converted to spinel above 1000°C.<br>
The method is associated with the following darwbacks: (i) The preparative technique is dependent on a freeze-dryer and hence is costly, (ii) Decomposition temperature of the mixed sulphate precursor is quite high.<br>
Reference may also be made to P. W. D. Mitchel in "J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 55 (1972) p. 484" wherein stoichiometric quantities of aluminium hydroxychloride, Al2(OH)5C1.2-3 H2O in an aqueous solution and a suspension of Mg(OH)2 in water was mixed. Rapid reaction between the two formed a gel. The gel was dried and ball-milled to a fine powder. At 900°C, the gel partly converted to spinel; complete conversion to spinel takes place at around 1300°C.<br>
The main difficulty of the above method is that the spinel formation occurs at a considerably high temperature.<br>
Reference may also be made to M. Sugiura and O. Kamigaito in "Yogyo-Kyokai-Shi, 92 (1984), pp. 605-611" wherein a mixed alkoxide, MgAl2(i-C3H7)8, was used for the synthesis of spinel. In this method, the alkoxide was dissolved in a 1 : 1 mixture of benzene and ethanol under Ar atmosphere. Water was added dropwise under stirring, when a white powdery material was precipitated. The precipitate was dried under vacuum at 90°C and then calcined at 1000°C for crystallization to spinel phase.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above process are : (i) It is difficult to obtain the mixed alkoxide of Mg-Al.<br><br>
(ii)       Dissolution of the alkoxide is carried out in Ar atmosphere.<br>
(iii)      Drying of the precipitated material id performed under vacuum and<br>
(iv)      The crystallization temperature is quite high.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of spherical magnesium aluminate (MgAI2O4) powder which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known processes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacturing spherical MgAI2O4 powder using water-based sols and gels which are not health hazard and does not create any atmospheric pollution during heat treatment.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of spherical MgAI2O4 powders which uses precursor chemicals that are cost effective, and safe.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of spherical MgAI2O4 powder which crystallizes at a lower temperature, thus making the process energy efficient.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a tailor-made process of spherical powder synthesis as the particle size and size distribution can be varied according to the necessity.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process of manufacturing spherical MgAI2O4 powder which is very simple and cost-effective.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which directly produces end product of minimum agglomeration and does not require any post-processing steps like high energy ball-milling, screening, thus avoiding possibility of contamination and further cost saving.

The novelty of the present invention primarily resides in providing a process of obtaining a spherical magnesium aluminate (MgA12O4) powder which is economical, environment friendly, energy efficient, high yielding and time saving which makes the process suitable for industrial manufacture and the non-obvious inventive steps lies in the dispersion of Mg-Al aqueous mixed sol as droplets into a solution of non-aqueous, water-immiscible organic solvent and non-ionic surfactant of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value in the range 4 - 15 to obtain an water-in oil (w/o) type emulsion, gelling the stabilized sol droplets by using an organic amine to produce the corresponding gel powders in which the sphericity of sol droplets is properly retained. The surfactant added to the system reduces the interfacial tension between the sol droplets and the water immiscible organic solvents and prevents the coalescence of the sol droplets by steric hindrance after absorbing on their surfaces. This stabilized sol droplets produces the corresponding gel microspheres with minimum of agglomeration and avoids grinding and milling operations, prevents dust hazards and possibility of contamination. Judicious selection of surfactant of different HLB values and process parameters, spherical MgAl2O4 powders with desired size and size distribution are prepared.<br>
