FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides (i) processes for preparing a 2-deoxy-2-<br>
fluoro-2-methyl-D-ribonolactone derivatives, (ii) conversion of intermediate<br>
lactones to nucleosides with potent anti- HCV activity, and their analogues, and (iii)<br>
methods to prepare the anti-HCV nucleosides containing the 2'-deoxy-2'-f!' —o-2'-C-<br>
methyl-β-D-ribofuranosyl nucleosides from a preformed, preferably naturally-<br>
occurring, nucleoside.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
HCV infection has reached epidemic levels worldwide, and has tragic effects<br>
on the infected patients. Presently there is no effective treatment for this infection<br>
and the only drugs available for treatment of chronic hepatitis C are various forms of<br>
alpha interferon (IFN-α), either alone or in combination with ribavirin. However,<br>
the therapeutic value of these treatments has been compromised largely due to<br>
adverse effects, which highlights the need for development of additiona options for<br>
treatment.<br>
HCV is a small, enveloped virus in the Flaviviridae family, with a positive<br>
single-stranded RNA genome of ~9.6 kb within the nucleocapsid. The genome<br>
contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of just over<br>
3,000 amino acids, which is cleaved to generate the mature structural and<br>
nonstructural viral proteins. ORF is flanked by 5' and 3' non-translated regions<br>
(NTRs) of a few hundred nucleotides in length, which are important for RNA<br><br>
(NTRs) of a few hundred nucleotides in length, which are important for RNA<br>
translation and replication. The translated polyprotein contains the structural core<br>
(C) and envelope proteins (E1, E2, p7) at the N-terminus, followed by the<br>
nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B). The mature<br>
structural proteins are generated via cleavage by the host signal peptidase. The<br>
junction between NS2 and NS3 is autocatalytically cleaved by the NS2/NS3<br>
protease, while the remaining four junctions are cleaved by the N-terminal serine<br>
protease domain of NS3 complexed with NS4A. The NS3 protein also contains the<br>
NTP-dependent helicase activity which unwinds duplex RNA during replication.<br>
The NS5B protein possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) activity,<br>
which is essential for viral replication. Unlike HBV or HIV, no DNA is involved in<br>
the replication of HCV.<br>
U. S. Patent Publication (US 2005/0009737 A1) discloses that 1 -(2-deoxy-2-<br>
fluoro-2-C-methyl-β-D-ribofuranosyl)cytosine (14) is a potent and selective anti-<br>
HCV agent. Previously known synthetic procedures (Schemes 3) for this<br>
compound are quite inefficient, with very low overall ylelds and are not amendable<br>
to large-scale.<br><br><br><br><br>
Previously known methods for the preparation of (2'R)-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-<br>
2'-C-methyl nucleosides, and its analogues, from D-xylose, cytidine, or uridine<br>
employed DAST or Deoxofluor® for the key fluorination reaction. However, DAST<br>
and Deoxofluor® are expensive, hazardous for industrial synthesis, and provide<br>
often unreliable results. Therefore, these alkylaminosulfur trifluorides are not<br>
suitable for industrial production.<br>
As a part of an effort to find better fluorination conditions, it has been<br>
discovered that opening of a cyclic sulfate with non- alkylaminosulfur trifluoride<br>
fluorinating agents is an excellent way to synthesize the anti-HCV nucleoside, (2'R)-<br>
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methylcytidine. In addition, it was discovered that this<br>
novel synthetic route can be adopted to other nucleosides including the anti-HCV<br>
nucleoside, D-2-deoxy-2-fluoro- cytidine (Devos, et al, U.S. Pat. 6,660,721), anti-<br>
HBV nucleosides, D and L-2'-3'-didehydro-2'-3'-dideoxy-2-fiuoro-nucleosides<br>
(Schinazi, et al, U.S. Pat. 6,348,587) (I and II, Figure 3) as well as other 2'-<br>
substituted nucleosides such as D- and L-FMAU (Su, et al., J Med. Chem, 1986,<br>
29,151-154; Chu, et al., U.S. Pat. 6,512,107).<br><br>
What is needed is a novel and cost effective process for the synthesis of 2-C-<br>
alkyl-2-deoxy-2-substituted-D-ribopyranosyl nucleosides that have activity against<br>
HCV.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Presently no preventive means against Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C<br>
virus (HCV), Dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV) or Yellow Fever virus<br>
(YFV), infection is available. The only approved therapies are for treatment of HCV<br>
infection with alpha interferon alone or in combination with the nucleoside ribavirin,<br>
but the therapeutic value of these treatments has been compromised largely due to<br>
adverse effects. It was recently discovered that a group of nucleosides, including 2 -<br>
deoxy-2'-fluoro-2'-C-methylcytidine, exhibit potent and selective activity against<br>
replication of HCV in a replicon system. However, the difficulty of chemical<br>
synthesis of this and analogous nucleosides impedes further biophysical,<br>
biochemical, pharmacological evaluations mandatory for development of clinical<br>
drugs for treatment of Flaviviridae infection.<br>
The present invention provides an efficient preparation of nucleosides and<br>
intermediates containing the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methyl-D-ribofuranosyl moiety.<br>

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug" is used throughout<br>
the specification to describe any pharmaceutically acceptable form (such as an ester,<br>
phosphate ester, salt of an ester or a related group) of a compound which, upon<br>
administration to a patient, provides the active compound. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or<br>
organic bases and acids. Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such<br>
as potassium and sodium, alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium,<br>
among numerous other acids well known in the pharmaceutical art.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be acid addition salts when formed with<br>
a nitrogen atom. Such salts are derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic<br>
or organic acids, such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, tartaric,<br>
and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs refer to a compound that is<br>
metabolized, for example hydrolyzed or oxidized, in the host to form the compound<br>
of the present invention. Typical examples of prodrugs include compounds that<br>
have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety of the active<br>
compound. Prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated,<br>
deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated,<br>
dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated, dephosphorylated to produce the<br>
active compound.<br><br>
Applicants have developed a novel, practical and efficient process for the<br>
synthesis of 2-C-alkyl-2-deoxy-2-substituted-D-ribofuranose derivatives, the key<br>
intermediates to 14 (Scheme 1) and derivatives and analogues thereof using or<br>
without using chiral catalysts. The key step in the synthesis of 14 is asymmetric<br>
conversion of 41 to 42 using chiral catalysts (Scheme 4). The previous disclosed<br>
synthesis of 42 required Sharpless AD catalysts, such as dihydroquinidine (DHQD)<br>
and derivatives. The present invention as disclosed herein relates to the<br>
stereoselective preparation of 41 to 42 using osmium, osmate or permanganate<br>
without chiral catalysts. The applicants in this present invention also develop a<br>
practical and efficient process for the synthesis of 49 from 42 by using the<br>
nucleophilic opening of the cyclic sulfate 50 (Scheme 6) in highly stereospecific and<br>
regioselective manner. The procedure depicted in Schemes 4, 5 and 6 are the current<br>
method of choice for preparative synthesis of 14 and related derivatives.<br><br><br><br><br>

The reaction of the cyclic c,r.^ o Tj 50 (Scheme 6) with<br>
tetraethylammonium fluoride or tetramethylammonium fluoride 51(Scheme 6)<br>
quantitatively genated the fluorinated sulfate, in highly stereospecific and<br>
regioselective manner. Following acid catalyzed cyclization afforded the 2'-fluoro-<br>
2-C -methyl-y-ribonolactone, 53 in high yleld.<br>
The present invention is based on this discovery and provides a process for the<br>
preparation of the 2'-deoxy-2'-substituted nucleosides, I and II, using the reactions<br>
described herein.<br>
(2S, 3R, 4R)-4,5-O-alkylidene-2-dimethyl-2, 3, 4, 5-tetrahydroxy-2-methyl-<br>
pentanoic acid ethyl ester (42B), can be prepared by asymmetric dihydroxylation<br>

The diol (42B) can be converted to the cyclic sulfite (Ilia) by treatment with<br>
thionyl chloride (SOCI2) in presence of alkylamine such as triethylamine,<br>
diisopropyl ethylamine, or pyridine, which can then be oxidized using the oxidants<br>
selected from a first group consisting of RuCh, KMNO4, and TEMPO or a<br>
combination of the first group and onp of the second group consisting of NalC&gt;4,<br>
KIO4, HIO4, mCPBA, NaOCl, and oxone. The solvent of this step is selected fron;<br>
one or more of the group consisting of chlor^rm, methylef» chloride, 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, and toluene, alone or in<br>
combination with water. (Gao Y et a\J. Am. Chan. Soc. 1988, J10, 7538-7539,<br>
Berridge et al J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55, 1211-1217). It is also possible that the diol is<br>
directly converted to the cyclic sulfate (Vb) by treatment with sulfurylchloride, or<br>
sulfuryl diimidazole. On the other hand, the diol 42B can be converted to the cyclic<br>
carbonate(IIIc) by treatment with carbonyl diimidazole or carbonyl dimethoxide<br>
(Scheme 8) (Chang, et al Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 3219-3222).<br><br><br>
(ii) Synthesis of the substituted 2-deoxy-D-ribono-y-latone, 53B<br>
The cyclic sulfate 'TTTb, Scheme 8) can be converted to the fluorinated sulfate<br>
ester of the formula, 51B (Scheme 9), in high yleld and with high regioselectivity<br>
and stereospecificity, by treatment with tetraalkylammonium fluoride including, but<br>
not limited to tetramethylammoniurn fluoride (TMAF), tetraethylammonium<br>
fluoride (TEAF), or tetrabutylammomnium fluoride (TBAF), or<br>
tris(dirnehtylarnino)sulfur (trimethylsilyl)difluoride (TAS-F) (Fuentes J, et al<br>
Tetrahedron lett. 1998, 39, 7149-7152) in a protic polar solvent such as acetone,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, Af/V-dimethylformamide, or acetonitrile (Scheme 9). Metal<br>
fluorides such as silver fluoride (AgF), potassium fluoride (KF), cesium fluoride<br>
(CsF), or rubidium fluoride (RbF), can be used alone or with catalytic amount of<br>
tetraalkylammonium fluoride, crown-ether, diglyme, or polyethylene glycol, or other<br>
phase transfer catalyst.<br>
The cyclic sulfate (IHb) can be converted to other 2-substituted sulfates of<br>
the formula SIB by treatment with NaBH4, tetraalkylammonium chloride,<br>
tetraalkylammonium bromide, NaN3 or LiN3, NH4OR, NH4SCN, CF3I-<br>
tetrakis(dimethylamino)-ethylene (TDAE), and tetraalkylammonium nitrate (Gao et<br>
al J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 7538-7539), KCN, LiCu(R)2 where R is methyl,<br>
ethyl, ethylenyl, or ethnyl. Similarly, the cyclicsulfite (Ilia) can be converted to the<br>
substituted ester 52B (Chang et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 3219-3222). Then<br>
compounds of the formula 51B and 52B can be converted to the substituted lactones<br><br>
of the formula 53B by treatment with an acid in H2O-containing organic solvent<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, or acetonitrile.<br>
In Formula 53B, R2, R3 is independently hydrogen, a lower alkyl (C1-C6)<br>
including, but not limited to methyl, hydroxymethyl, methoxymethyl, halomethyl<br>
including, but not limited to fluoromethyl, ethyl, propyl, optionally substituted<br>

substituted ethnyl including, but not limited to haloethnyl (F-OC), optionally<br>
substituted allyl including, but not limited to haloallyl (FHC=CH-CH*2-). Nu is<br>
halogen (F, Cl, ^ ' " h, CN, NO3, CF3, SCN, OR or NR2 where R is acyl including,<br>
but not limited to acetyl, benzoyl, arylalkyl including but not limited to benzyl, lower<br>
alkyl (C1-10) including, but not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, CH*2R where K is<br>
hydrogen, lower alkyl (CMQ) including, but not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl.<br><br>
(Hi) The protection of the D-ribono-y-latone, 53B<br>
53B can be selectively protected with appropriate protection agents to the 5-<br>
protected lactones of the formula 53C with an appropriate base in an appropriate<br>
solvent. The protecting group includes, but is not limited to the following: trityl, t-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, benzyloxymethyl, benzoyl, toluoyl, 4-phenyl<br>
benzoyl, 2-, 3-, or 4-nitrobenzoyl, 2-, 3-, or 4-chlorobenzoyl, other substituted<br>
benzoyl. The base includes, but is not limited to the following: imidazole, pyridine,<br>
4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, triethytlamine, diisopropylethylamine, 1,4-<br><br>
diazabicyclo[2,2,2]-octane. The solvent includes, but is not limited to the following:<br>
pyridine, dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran.<br><br>
Alternatively, the lactone 53B can be fully protected with appropriate<br>
protection agents with an appropriate base in an appropriate solvent. The protecting<br>
group (R5, R6) includes, but is not limited to the following: methoxymethyl,<br>
methoxyethyl, benzyloxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, trityl, triethylsilyl, t-<br>
butyldimefhvlsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, acyl including acetyl, pivaloyl, benzoyl,<br>
toluoyl, 4-phenyl benzoyl, 2-, 3-, or 4-nitrobenzoyl, 2-, 3-, or 4-chlorobenzoyl, other<br>
substituted benzoyl, The base includes, but is not limited to the following list:<br>
imidazole, pyridine, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, triethytlamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, l,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane. The solvent includes, but is<br>
not limited to pyridine, dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran (Scheme 10).<br><br>
(iv) Complexation directed β-glycosylation<br><br>
Coupling of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C ...ihyl-ribofuranoside (54: Nu=F,<br>
R3=Me, R5=R6=pivaloyl) with silylated A^-benzoylcytosine in the presence of<br>
trimethylsilyl trifiuorometha. sulfonate (TMSOTf) in CHCI3 gave a mixture of ct/β-<br>
anomers with a ratio of 2/1 in favor of a-isomer. However, P-anomer was obtained<br>
as major product (a/p = 1/4.9) in the same reactior catalyzed by SnCl4 ui;Iz: :imilar<br>
conditions. Possible mechanisms are proposed in Scheme 10A (R5 and R6 are O-<br>
protecting groups that can be acyl or silyl or alkyl or aralkyl with Ci_2o)- Treatment<br>
of 54 with silylated A^-benzoylcytosine in the presence of TMSOTf in CHCI3<br>
formed an oxonium intermediate 54-i. Silylated base could attack 54-1 from uβ-side<br>
to give P-anomer 55B or from bottom to provide cc-anomer 55B-aIpha Because of<br>
stereohinderance at uβ-side caused by 2-methyl group, silylated base attacked<br>
intermediate 54-i mainly from bottom (less stereohindered side) to afford a mixture -<br>
of cc/β-anomers with a ratio of 2/1 in favor of a-anomer. While treatment of 54 with<br>
silylated A^-benzoylcytosine in the presence of SnCU , a complex 54-ii was formed<br>
instead of oxonium 54-i. Silyated y-benzoylcytosine attacked 54-ii from less<br><br>
stereohindered uβ-side to give a mixture of a/β-anomers with a ratio of 1/5 in favor<br>
of β-anomer.<br>
Compound 54 can be made from the protected lactone of the formula, 49B,<br>
which can be reduced with DFBAL-H or lithium tri-rer/-butoxyaluminum hydride<br>
and other hydride reducing agent to the lactol, which can then converted either to the<br>
acylate by acylation with acyl halide, or acyl anhydride, in presence of an appropriate<br>
base in an appropriate solvent. Acyl halide or acyl anhydride includes, but is not<br>
limited to the following list: acetic chloride, optionally substituted benzoyl chloride,<br>
acetic anhydride, optionally substituted benzoyl anhydride. The base includes, but is<br>
not limited to the following: imidazole, pyridine, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine,<br>
triethytlamine, diisopropylethylamine, 1,4- diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane. The solvent<br>
includes, but is not limited to the following list: pyridine, dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran.<br>
(v) Synthesis of the L-nucleosides, IB-L<br>
The pr. cesses for the D-series of the formula I and II can be used for<br>
preparation of the L-nucleosides of the formula, IB-L from the (S)-glyceraldehydes<br>
(Scheme 11).<br><br>
(vi) Synthesis of 2-alkyI-4,5-di-O-protected-2, 3-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid<br>
Currently, the most preferable procedure for the synthesis of nucleosides of<br>
general structures I and II is the preparation of a derivative of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-<br>
2-C-methyl-D-ribofuranosyl moiety of I and II as shown in Scheme 4, Scheme 5 and<br>
Scheme 6, above through (i) synthesis of the intermediate, derivatives of 2-alkyl-4,5-<br>
di-O-protected-2,3-dihydroxy-pentanoic-acid ester of general structure I, (ii)<br><br>
conversion of 42B into the 3,5-protected 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methyl-D-ribono-y-<br>
latone of general structure 49B, and (iii) conversion of 49B into purine and<br>
pyrimidine nucleosides of general structures of I and II. The key step in Scheme 4 is<br>
the stereoselective osmium catalyzed dihydroxylation of olefinic intermediate 41<br>
into 42 in the presence of the expensive Sharpless AD catalyst. Instead of the<br>
Sharpless catalyst, if other chiral compounds such as L-quinidine are used, the<br>
reaction also goes smoothly giving the desired 42. Kishi et al. have proposed that in<br>
OsC&gt;4 dihydroxylation of allylic alcohol den natives (esters, ethers, acetals or ketals),<br>
the major course of reaction would occur on the face of the olefinic bond opposite to<br>
that of the preexisting hydroxyl or alkoxyl group, (Tetrahedron Lett, 1983, 24,<br>
3943). Some examples are shown in Scheme 12 (Tetrahedron Lett, 1983, 24, 3947).<br>
In every case, the major product arose from addition of Os04 from the anti side of<br>
the oxygen on the neighboring secondary carbon. However, stereoselectivity is not<br>
high enough for preparative synthesis.<br><br><br>
Encouraged by Kishi's rule, which presents that the stereochemistry is<br>
formulated as arising from the preferential approach of osmium tetroxide to occur on<br>
the face of the olefinic bond opposite to that of the preexisting hydroxyl or alkoxyl<br>
group, dihydroxylations of 41 under the original conditions but without any chiral<br>
catalysts, including Sharpless AD catalyst, were conducted. Dihydroxylation of 41<br>
using Ke3Fe(CN)6/K20s02(OH)4/K.2CO3 system without chiral catalysts gives the<br>
product in 77% yleld, which product is a 5:1 mixture of isomers with the<br>
predominant isomer being the desired 42. The reaction of olefin 41 with OsC&gt;4 using<br>
N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) as the oxidant without chiral catalysts gave a<br>
5:1 mixture of 42 and its isomer in 79% yleld. Most surprisingly, when t-<br>
butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) is used as oxidant in the presence of catalytic amount of<br>
OsC&gt;4 in acetone and ammonium acetate as buffer (the reagent combination was used<br>
in the synthesis of alditols by Masamur.e and Sharpless (J. Org. Chem, 1982, 47,<br><br>
1373)), the crystalline product isolated is the virtually pure desired 42. This<br>
procedure is therefore far superior to the OsOVNMO and Fe(CN)63' methods. At 10<br>
mmolar scale, the desired diol 42 is formed exclusively, and is isolated in 87% yleld.<br>
No contamination by the other isomer was detected in this product by vigorous !H<br>
NMR analyses.<br>
It is well known that in OSO4 oxidation the intermediate is cyclic osmate V<br>
(below) (Criegee, Liebigs Ann. Chem., 1936, 522, 75). m-Dihydroxylation of<br>
olefins with potassium permanganate in alkaline media has been known for quite<br>
some time (Robinson and Robinson, J. Chem. Soc, 1925,127, 1628), and this<br>
reaction appears to proceed through a cyclic ester VI. Thus attempts at<br>
permanganate dihydroxylation have been performed.<br><br>
Previous reports have indicated that permanganate dihydroxylation of olefins<br>
in acid or neutral conditions causes over-oxidation of the initial diol products with<br>
concomitant production of ketones and earboxylates. Only in alkaline conditions<br>
further oxidation of the diol products can be decelerated. As 41 is a carboxylic ester<br>
the reaction cannot be done in aqueous alkali. Hazra et al. (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin<br>
Trans. I, 1994,1667) describes successful dihydroxylation of highly substituted<br>
olefins to the corresponding diols using tetradecyltrimethylammoniurn permanganate<br>
(TDTAP) in a mixture of r-BuOH, dichloromethane and water in the presence of 0.1<br>
equivalent of KOH. Application of this method to dihydroxylation of 41 results in<br>
rapid formation (within 10 minutes at room temperature) of a mixture of 42 and its<br>
diastereomer in an 8:1 ratio, which is isolated in 71% yleld. Oxidation occurs much<br>
faster in similar reactions without KOH, but the yleld of 42 is not improved.<br>
Mukaiyama et al. (Chem. Lett., 1983, 173) disclosed dihydroxylation of<br>
olefins with KMn04 and, 18-crown-6 ether in dichloromethane at -40°C. Attempts<br>
at dihydroxylation of 41 under Mukaiyama's conditions but at different temperatures<br><br>
offer a 6:1 mixture of 42 and its diastereomer in 50% yleld at -40°C and the same<br>
mixture in 94% yleld at -10°C.<br>
Surprisingly, in contrast to the teaching of the prior of art which discloses<br>
that oxidation of a double bond with KMn04 proceeds via diol wherein the resultant<br>
diol is rapidly oxidized further without the presence of base, diol 42 was found to be<br>
isolable when the corresponding 41 is treated with KMn04 without added alkali and<br>
crown ether. In pure r-butanol, oxidation does not proceed even at room temperature<br>
conditions for two days. Addition of water to the mixture promotes the reaction. It<br>
is found that the more water in the reaction media the faster the reaction proceeds<br>
with poor selectivity of 42 production; the less water the slower the reaction but<br>
improved selectivity. In any case, the yleld is rather poor due to further oxidation.<br>
Most surprisingly, and in contradiction to the prior art, treatment of 41 with<br>
KMnC&gt;4 in acetone is found to give a 10:1 mixture in quantitative yleld, the desired<br>
42 being the major component. The stereoselectivity is found to be improved by<br>
performing the reaction in a mixture of acetone and pyridine.<br>
