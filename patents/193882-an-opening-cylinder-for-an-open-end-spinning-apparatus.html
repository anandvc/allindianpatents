The present invention relates to an opening cylinder for an open-end spinning apparatus.<br>
Opening cylinders are used in open-end spinning apparatus for separating from one another fibres which are to be spun and which are supplied to the opening cylinder in the form of a sliver  The opening cylinder rotates at high speed and, by means of its clothing, which may comprise teeth or needles, detaches from the sliver individual fibres which are then supplied to a spinning member. The clothing of an opening cylinder is not in fact suitable for all sliming materials, so that when a spinning machine is reset for a new starting material the opening cylinder or the clothing thereof has to be changed. Moreover, the clothing is subject to wear, so that for this reason too an exchange of the clothing is necessary.<br>
Various constructions of an opening cylinder having an exchangeable clothing are known for this purpose from the prior art. The opening cylinder is arranged on a shaft which is carried by a bearing, so that the opening cylinder is thus constructed to be rotatable, at least part of the opening cylinder, which comprises a plurality of parts, being connected directly to the shaft. This is usually achieved by means of a press fit. It is known from DE-OS 25 28 485 to construct the opening cylinder-in a plurality of parts for the purpose of exchangeability of the clothing, the opening cylinder having a base body which is secured to a shaft by way of a press fit and<br><br>
the clothing being mounted on the opening cylinder by way of a clothing holder such that a fixed relationship between the base body and the clothing holder is ensured. The possibility of the clothing becoming detached or entrained is eliminated. For this purpose, securing means, for example in the form of screws, which pass through a passage opening in the clothing holder into the base body are provided. These securing means are arranged on the end face of the opening cylinder which is arranged on the side of the opening cylinder remote from the bearing. This construction has the disadvantage that the securing means give these end faces a rough surface. Fibre particles can get caught on this, accumulate and become detached again, in which case effective points are generated in the yam, and moreover the shaft projects into the end face. Although it is known for the construction of the end faces of opening cylinders to be as free of sharp edges as possible, the proposed solutions are not very satisfactory. Known from US-PS 4,296,527 is a construction which dispenses with securing means completely. For this, the base body and the clothing holder are formed such that they are mutually secured to one another for example by way of a thread. This document also discloses another construction in which the clothing holder is screwed to the opening cylinder on the end side remote from the bearing by means of a screw. The second construction is thus similar to that of DE-OS 25 28 485. The constructions first mentioned have the disadvantage that their manufacture is expensive, or the connection between the base body and  the clothing  holder is<br><br>
either not sufficiently secure or else the connection can only be detached again with difficulty. Known from Patent Specification CH 661 535 A5 is a further opening cylinder whereof the clothing holder is secured without securing means. For this purpose, the clothing holder is, like the base body, shrunk onto the shaft. This has the disadvantage that it is time-consuming to exchange the clothing. Moreover, the shaft on which the opening cylinder is carried may be damaged by repeatedly pressing on a press-fit part.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to construct an opening cylinder for an open-end spinning unit such that the clothing can be exchanged easily and rapidly, its structure and the securing means are of a simple construction and the opening cylinder is constructed, and the securing means arranged such that no defects in the yam quality are caused. According to the invention, this object is achieved by the features of claim 1. The invention here takes as its starting point the realization that it is not sufficient simply to construct the securing means to be as free of edges as possible but, surprisingly, that it is also important on which of the two end sides of the opening cylinder the securing means are arranged. In a further development of the opening cylinder housing for opening cylinders of open-end spinning machines, the prior art has in the meantime provided for the transportation of fibres to be performed not only, as hitherto, exclusively in the peripheral direction in the region of the clothing but, for certain applications, also<br><br>
to provide the fibres with the possibility of taking a path in the opening cylinder housing which leads them along the end side of the opening cylinder. In this case, it was provided for the fibres to be guided along the end face of the opening cylinder remote form the bearing. This realization has led to new standards having to be set for the development of opening cylinders.<br>
The German Patent Application P 43 41 411.7-26 describes one such aforementioned manner of guiding the fibres in the opening cylinder housing. As a result of the construction of the opening cylinder in accordance with the invention, the effect is that the end face of the opening cylinder remote from the bearing can be constructed as a planar face which has no bumps, depressions or other edges on which fibres can become caught. As a result of this, this opening cylinder can also be used in open-end spinning machines having an improved fibre guide in the opening cylinder housing. By using securing means, it is possible to dispense with complex constructions of the base body and the clothing holder, which can then be connected to one another by means of their own shaping, and a low-cost type of securing, for example using screws, can be used. At the same time, this has the advantage of being simple to operate whilst ensuring that the base body and clothing holder are connected securely, and moreover the shaft is covered in a simple manner.<br><br>
It is particularly favourable if the base body is constructed such that it contains the end face facing the bearing, and this makes it easily possible to exchange the clothing holder, since the latter does not have to be guided over the bearing. The risk of damaging the clothing whilst it is being exchanged is consequently reduced. Moreover, this makes it possible for the bore of the hub of the base body to pass right through, which makes it easier to machine, and the shaft is covered by the clothing holder in a simple manner. However, it can also be favourable for the clothing holder to contain the end face facing the bearing, especially if the clothing holder cooperates with an annular clothing support. Then, for dismantling, the opening cylinder may be laid on its end face remote from the bearing and the clothing holder may then be removed and subsequently the annular clothing support may be taken off. As a result of this simple handling, the risk of damaging the clothing is substantially reduced. The base body then covers the shaft with its end face remote from the bearing.<br>
The base body or clothing holder are of a particularly favourable construction if they contain a passage opening for a securing means, where the passage opening may for example be a bore which extends parallel to the shaft on which the opening cylinder is carried. If the base body has, the passage opening, then the securing means for example a screw, is guided through this base body and then extends into the clothing  holder, where the thread for this screw is arranged.<br><br>
Accordingly, the opposite is the case if, in a different construction of the opening cylinder, the clothing holder has the passage opening through which the securing means is guided, this securing means then ending in a thread in the base body. In a particularly favourable construction of the opening cylinder, the clothing holder has a shape such that it has a substantially cylindrical outer face which in the axial direction corresponds approximately to the width of the clothing, and this clothing is mounted on the outer face of the clothing holder. This may be performed for example by a jagged wire or indeed for example by a clothing support which is pressed on in fixed manner and has for example needles or teeth. In another favourable construction, the clothing holder has a receiver by means of which an annular clothing support is supported radially. In another favourable construction the clothing holder has stop which acts axially on a clothing support and thus holds the latter against the base body. It is also possible in this case for the clothing holder to have both a receiver and a stop. In a favourable construction of the securing means, the latter is constructed in the form of screws, it being particularly favourable if these are arrange with substantially uniform spacing from one another. In this case, it is particularly advantageous to ensure that the mass distribution over the opening cylinder is uniform, so that the latter does not run in an unbalanced manner. A single securing means is also conceivable if it is ensured that the opening cylinder is balanced.<br><br>
Advantageously, three screws are used for the association of the base body and clothing holder. If flat head screws are used, these have the advantage that, with an appropriate construction of the end face through which they are guided, they disturb the planarity of the end face only to a very small extent. A particularly favourable construction of the opening cylinder is one in which the thread for the screws is arranged in the clothing holder, since this has the effect that the opening cylinder receives a new thread when the clothing holder is exchanged. Since the clothing holder is often made from aluminium, even if the clothing is exchanged frequently the effect is that the securing is always equally possible, since the securing means can cooperate with an unused thread. In a particularly favourable construction, the clothing holder has an axial bore which is closed by means of a cover during operation of the opening cylinder. In this case, this cover is incorporated into the clothing holder such that this end face of the opening cylinder forms a virtually complete, smooth surface. If the clothing holder has this axial bore, the effect is in fact that, in the event that the clothing has to be coated during manufacture, a plurality of clothing holders can be received on lower cost. It is particularly favourable when the cover is dismantled, since the interior of the opening cylinder can then be cleaned without having to dismantle the clothing support.<br>
For  assembling  clothing  holders on the base body, it is advantageous if an<br><br>
adjustment device is provided on the opening cylinder which, during assembly, enables the passage openings through which the securing means, for example the screws, are guided to be aligned precisely with the respective threads, so that it is not necessary to locate them first. For this purpose, a stop which indicates the correct position of the clothing holder with respect to the base body is provided. If the stop cooperates with a spiral edge on the base body, there is the advantage that the clothing holder can be placed on the base body and rotated until the stop fits in. By continuing to turn in the same direction of motion, the stop is guided into its end position, which then denotes the correct association. In this connection, a spiral edge has the advantage that in the event of rotating in the wrong direction there is no fixed stop but only a tightness and ultimately jamming. It is particularly favourable if at least the end face of the opening cylinder remote from the bearing has a spiral groove which is arranged such that, as a result of the rotation of the opening cylinder, air is conveyed radially outwards from the region of the axis of rotation of the end face. In an advantageous further development, it is provided for at least the clothing holder to be constructed as an extruded component. Thus, a pore-free surface can be obtained, as a result of which the component can be coated at a particularly lower cost.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an opening cylinder for an open-end spinning apparatus having a base body which contains at least part of an end face<br><br>
of the opening cylinder and by means of which the opening cylinder is secured to a shaft carried by a bearing for the purpose of rotatably bearing the opening cylinder, having a clothing holder which contains at least part of an end face of the opening cylinder and which is intended to hold a clothing, and having one or more securing means for the fixed association of the clothing holder with the base body, characterized in that the clothing holder is secured from the end face of the opening cylinder facing the bearing, and the shaft is covered by the base body or the clothing holder.<br>
The invention is described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in<br>
which<br>
Figure 1 shows an opening cylinder with its bearing, partially in section;<br>
Figure   2   shows a partial illustration of an opening cylinder in section, with an<br>
annular clothing support;<br>
Figure 3 shows a plan view of the base body, with the clothing holder illustrated in<br>
section; and<br>
Figure 4  shows a plan view of the end face of the opening cylinder remote from<br>
the bearing.<br>
The opening cylinder 1 of Figure 1 is mounted on a shaft 2 which is carried by a bearing .   On its side remote from the opening cylinder 1, the shaft 2 carries a<br><br>
whorl 21, by way of which the opening cylinder is driven with the aid of a belt. The opening cylinder 1 itself, illustrated in section in the lower half of the drawing, comprises a base body 11 and a clothing holder 12. The clothing holder 12 is connected to the base body 11 by way of a securing means 4 in the form of a screw 41. The base body 11 has a hub 111 which is pressed onto the shaft 2 by way of a press fit. The base body 11 has a passage opening 112 which has the shape of a bore through which the screw 41 is guided and extends into the clothing holder 12, where it cooperates with a thread 117. The passage opening 112 extends parallel to the axis 22 of the shaft 2.<br>
According to the invention, the clothing holder 12 is secured from the side of the end face 14 of the opening cylinder 1 facing the bearing 3. This means that the surface of the end face 14 facing the bearing is interrupted, because the securing means 4 projects through the surface thereof. As a result of constructing the screw 41 as a flat head screw, however, the disruption to the planarity and smoothness of the surface of the end face 14 is kept to a minimum. For receiving the flat head screw 41, the passage opening 112 is chamfered in the region of the end face 14.<br>
To increase the stability of the base body 11 and in particular its hub 111, the base body is reinforced with ribs 114. Particularly advantageously, the base body 11 has air guides 115. The shaft 2 as, over its entire length, an axially parallel bore<br><br>
23 through which the air guide 115 is in contact by way of the bore 23 with the outside air, that is to say the air outside an opening cylinder housing. This has the advantage that the sealing gap 9 between the base body 11 and the sleeve 31 of the bearing 3 is in contact with the outside air. As a result, air can flow through the bore 23, by way of the air guide 115, into the region in front of the end face 14 facing the bearing. The effect of this is that the interior of the opening cylinder is kept free of fibres and dirt, which could otherwise pass through the sealing gap 9 into the interior and there soil for example the ball bearing of the shaft 2, or accumulate such that it is no longer possible for the base body to perform a rotary movement in relation to the sleeve 31 of the bearing 3. Particularly in the event of unfavourable pressure ratios in the opening cylinder housing, it is possible for dirt or fibres to penetrate into the opening cylinder.<br>
To receive the clothing holder 12, the base body 11 has receiving faces 116 by means of which the clothing holder 12 is centered on the base body 11. The clothing holder 12 has a cylindrical outer surface 121 which has an axial length corresponding to the width of the clothing 8 mounted on the outer surface. The clothing holder 12 is constructed in one piece with the cylindrical outer surface 121, resulting in a particularly favourable and simple construction. The cylindrical outer surface 121 has grooves 122 in which the base of a clothing wire is fitted. The end face 15 of the opening cylinder 1 remote from the bearing 3 is in this case<br><br>
particularly advantageously formed completely by the clothing holder 12. It would also be conceivable, in another construction of the base body 11, for the latter to extend into the plane of the end face 15 remote from the bearing 3, as a result of which this end face would be formed partly by the base body 11 and partly by the clothing holder 12. However, this would have the disadvantage that a gap would be formed between the two, in which soiling from fibres could accumulate, leading to disruptions in the spinning operation. However, with this construction it is particularly favourable, by comparison with the prior art, that the shaft 2 does not reach into the plane of the end face 15 facing the bearing 3 but is covered by the base body 11 or the clothing holder 12. The end of the shaft 2 in fact has a particular tendency to accumulate fibres. The clothing holder 12 of Figure 1 has an axial bore 123 which is closed by the cover 124, so that the end face 15 remote from the bearing 3 is completely planar, the transition between the cover 124 and the clothing holder 12 having a gap which is so small that it cannot result in disruptions to the spinning operation. The purpose of the axial bore 123 is to facilitate handling of the clothing holder 12 during the manufacture thereof Especially if the clothing 8 is coated, it is possible to thread a plurality of clothing holders 12 onto one mandrel as a result of the presence of the axial bore 123, so that they can be coated together.<br>
In the embodiment of figure 1, the base body 11 supports the end face 14 facing<br><br>
the bearing 3. However, it would be equally possible to construct the base body such that the latter had the end face 15 remote from the bearing 3. This would correspondingly have the consequence that the clothing holder would have the end face 14 facing the bearing 3, During assembly and disassembly thereof, the clothing holder would then have to be supplied to the base body by way of the bearing 3. In this case, the base body would correspondingly have the thread for screwing in the screws, and the clothing holder would have a passage opening for pushing the screws through. The construction shown in figure 1 has the advantage by comparison with this construction, however, that when the clothing holder 12 is exchanged a new thread 112 is also inserted every time. Since the opening cylinder is usually manufactured from aluminium, which is known not to be very hard, and correspondingly threads will wear more quickly, this is particularly advantageous.<br>
The opening cylinder partially illustrated in section in Figure 2 also contains a securing means 4 with the aid of which the end face 14 facing the bearing 3 is secured. However, the opening cylinder of Figure 2 has an annular clothing support 7 which, with the aid of the clothing holder 12 and the securing means 4, is connected to the base body 11 of the opening cylinder 1. The clothing holder 12 has a receiver 125 which radially guides the annular clothing support. At the same time, the clothing holder 12 has a stop 126   which axially guides the annular<br><br>
clothing support 7. In the example embodiment shown in Figure 2, the clothing support 7 is provided with a clothing 8 which comprises a drawn-on clothing wire. However, the clothing support 7 can also have a clothing which is produced from a solid piece, that is to say for example is ground out of the clothing support 7. Similarly, it goes without saying that clothing supports 7 which are provided with needles can also be used. Unlike the example embodiment of Figure 1, the clothing holder 12 does not have an axial bore (123 in Figure 1). To guide the air through the bore 23 of the shaft 2 in the region of the clothing holder 12, the latter has a guide groove (not illustrated) for the air, so that the air guide 115 of the base body 11 is in contact with outside air by way of the bore 23 of the shaft 2.<br>
Figure 3 shows a plan view of the opening cylinder of Figure 1, from the side remote from the bearing 3, the clothing holder being illustrated in section in the region of the line A-A in Figure 1. The adjusting device essentially comprises an adjusting stop 61, which is mounted on the clothing holder 12, and an edge 62 which is constructed on the base body 11. The edge 62 is constructed in the form of a spiral line deviating slightly from a circle, with the centre point in the centre of the opening cylinder. The opening cylinder of Figure 3 has three such spiral edges 62 and the clothing holder 12 correspondingly has three adjusting stops 61. At the start and end of each spiral edge 62 there is, as a result of the differing spacing of the edge 62 from the centre point, a  shoulder 63 against which the adjusting stop<br><br>
61 abuts for the purpose of adjusting the clothing holder in relation to the base body 11. The spiral shape of the edge 62 has the advantage that when the clothing holder 12 is placed on the base body 11 the adjusting stop 61 usually comes to lie in a region where the spacing from the adjusting stop 61 to the centre point of the opening cylinder is smaller than the spacing from the edge 62. This means that the clothing holder 12 does not latch onto the base body 11. Only when the clothing holder 12 is turned clockwise in relation to the base body 11 does the adjusting stop 61 move into a region where there is play between the adjusting stop 61 and the edge 62, so that the clothing holder is seated on the base body 11. So that the threads (117 in Figure 1) can be brought into congruence with the passage openings 112, the clothing holder 12 now merely needs to be turned fiirther in the same direction until the adjusting stop 61 of the clothing holder 12 abuts against the shoulder 63 of the base body 11. In the example embodiment of Figure 3, three shoulders 63 are provided, which have the advantage that when the clothing holder 12 is placed on the base body 11 the holder is not so easily skewed. It is also possible to manage with fewer shoulders or adjusting stops.<br>
Figure 4 shows a plan view of the end face 14 of the opening cylinder remote from the bearing. In this construction, the end face 14 is provided with a spiral groove 140 which serves to convey air radially outwards from the region of the axis of rotation of the opening cylinder when the opening cylinder is rotated. The spiral<br><br>
groove 140 does not in this case have to extend to the centre point of the end face 14. It is sufficient if there is arranged at least in the outer region of the end face 14 a curved groove 140 which is suitable for conveying air radially outwards with the direction of rotation used in operation of the opening cylinder (arrow P), A groove of this type and of shorter construction, not shown in Figure 4, is particularly suitable in the end face of the opening cylinder facing the bearing. When making the groove 140, it should be ensured that it has no edges on which fibres can be caught.<br>
In the description of the present invention, the screw is particularly described as the securing means. However, it is also possible to use a type of bayonet closure.<br><br><br>
