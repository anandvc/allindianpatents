CURRENT-REGULATED LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE<br>
FOR VEHICLE USE<br>
The invention relates to a light emitting device,<br>
more particularly to a current-regulated light<br>
emitting device for vehicle use.<br>
Generally, a vehicle uses its battery to provide<br>
electric power for vehicle lights. Since battery<br>
voltage cannot be maintained at a constant level,<br>
battery power must undergo voltage stabilization and<br>
current rectification before it is supplied to the<br>
vehicle lights.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a conventional<br>
voltage-stabilized light emitting device for vehicle<br>
use is shown to be adapted for electrical connection<br>
to an electric power source 61 of a vehicle, and includes<br>
a rectifier 62 adapted for electrical connection to<br>
the electric power source 61, a surge suppressor 63,<br>
a light emitting unit 64, and a voltage regulating unit<br>
65 interconnecting the light emitting unit 64 and the<br>
rectifier 62. The light emitting unit 64 includes a<br>
plurality of light emitting components (D) and a<br>
plurality of current limiting resistors (R1) . The light<br>
emitting components (D) are connected in series-pairs,<br>
and all of the series-pairs of the light emitting<br>
components (D) are then connected in parallel. The<br>
voltage regulating unit 65 includes a voltage<br>
stabilizing integrated circuit (IC), two resistors<br><br>
2<br>
(R2) , and a capacitor (C) . The voltage regulating unit<br>
65 serves to stabilize a drive voltage from the electric<br>
power source 61 before supplying the same to the light<br>
emitting unit 64.<br>
When the electric power source 61 is unstable such<br>
that the drive voltage therefrom fluctuates, the<br>
voltage regulating unit 65 will operate to adjust the<br>
drive voltage to an appropriate value and to supply<br>
a stable current for the light emitting unit 64. In<br>
view of the need for continuous operation of the voltage<br>
regulating unit 65, the operating temperature thereof<br>
will increase, and prolonged operation at high<br>
temperatures affects operating stability and service<br>
life of the voltage regulating unit 65.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is<br>
to provide a highly stable current-regulated light<br>
emitting device for vehicle use with a switching design<br>
that permits components thereof to operate at a lower<br>
operating temperature.<br>
Accordingly, a current-regulated light emitting<br>
device for vehicle use of the present invention<br>
comprises a light emitting unit and a current limiting<br>
unit.<br>
The light emitting device includes at least one light<br>
emitting module that has a light emitting component.<br>
The current limiting unit includes a first switch, a<br>
first bias unit, a second switch and a second bias unit.<br><br>
3<br>
The first switch is adapted for making and breaking<br>
an electrical circuit between the light emitting unit<br>
and the electric power source. The first bias unit is<br>
connected electrically to the first switch, is adapted<br>
to be connected electrically to the electric power<br>
source, and causes the first switch to conduct such<br>
that the first switch makes the electrical circuit<br>
between the light emitting unit and the electric power<br>
source when the electric power source provides the drive<br>
voltage to the first bias unit, thereby resulting in<br>
current flow from the electric power source through<br>
the light emitting unit and the first switch to activate<br>
the light emitting unit. The second switch is connected<br>
electrically to the first switch. The second bias unit<br>
is connected electrically to the first and second<br>
switches, and causes the second switch to conduct when<br>
amount of current flowing through the first switch<br>
exceeds a predetermined threshold. Conduction of the<br>
second switch forces the first switch to turn off so<br>
as to break the electrical circuit between the light<br>
emitting unit and the electric power source, thereby<br>
interrupting the current flow through the light<br>
emitting unit.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent in the following<br>
detailed description of the preferred embodiment with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:<br><br>
4<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of a<br>
conventional voltage-stabilized light emitting device<br>
for vehicle use;<br>
Figure 2 is a functional block diagram of the<br>
preferred embodiment of a current-regulated light<br>
emitting device according to the present invention;<br>
and<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic circuit diagram of the<br>
preferred embodiment.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the preferred<br>
embodiment of a current-regulated light emitting<br>
device for vehicle use according to the present<br>
invention is shown to be adapted for electrical<br>
connection to an electric power source 4 and a brake<br>
device 5 of a vehicle. The electric power source 4 is<br>
operable to output a drive voltage (V1), and the brake<br>
device 5 is operable to output a braking voltage (V2).<br>
The current-regulated light emitting device comprises<br>
a light emitting unit 1, a current limiting unit 2,<br>
and a brightness increasing unit 3.<br>
The light emitting unit 1 is used as a vehicle light<br>
for illumination, is adapted for electrical connection<br>
to the electric power source 4 and the brake device<br>
5, and includes a plurality of light emitting modules<br>
11 connected in parallel, and three protective<br>
components 12. Each light emitting module 11 includes<br>
a first light emitting component (D1), a second light<br><br>
5<br>
emitting component (D2) , and a pair of current limiting<br>
resistors (R) . It is noted that, in practice, the number<br>
of the light emitting components of each light emitting<br>
module 11 is not limited to two. The current limiting<br>
resistors (R) of each light emitting module 11 are<br>
connected in parallel, and the parallel-connected<br>
current limiting resistors (R) are connected in series<br>
between the respective first light emitting component<br>
(D1) and the protective components 12.<br>
In this embodiment, each of the protective<br>
components 12 is an ordinary diode, e.g., 1N4007. One<br>
of the protective components 12 has an anode connected<br>
to the electric power source 4 and a cathode connected<br>
to the light emitting modules 11. Another of the<br>
protective components 12 has an anode connected to the<br>
brake device 5 and a cathode connected to the light<br>
emitting modules 11. The last of the protective<br>
components 12 has an anode connected to the brake device<br>
5 and a cathode connected to the brightness increasing<br>
unit 3 . The protective components 12 are used to protect<br>
the device of this invention from damage due to reverse<br>
polarity connection with the electric power source 4.<br>
The current limiting unit 2 includes a first switch<br>
(Q1), a second switch (Q2), a pair of first resistors<br>
(R10) that serve as a second bias unit, second and third<br>
resistors (R20, R30) that form a voltage divider of<br>
a first bias unit, and a first capacitor (C1).<br><br>
6<br>
In this embodiment, the first switch (Q1) is a<br>
n-channel depletion-type metal-oxide-semiconductor<br>
field-effect transistor (MOSFET). In practice, other<br>
components that can serve the same function may be used.<br>
The first switch (Ql) has a first control end (G), a<br>
first input end (D), and a first output end (S). The<br>
first control end (G) is the gate and is connected<br>
electrically to the first bias unit. The first input<br>
end (D) is the drain and is connected electrically to<br>
the cathodes of the second light emitting components<br>
(D2) of the light emitting modules 11 of the light<br>
emitting unit 1. The first output end (S) is the source<br>
and is connected electrically to the first resistors<br>
(R10) of the second bias unit. The first switch (Ql)<br>
must be capable of bearing a voltage, which has a value<br>
larger than the drive voltage (V1), between the first<br>
input end (D) and the first output end (S).<br>
In this embodiment, the second switch (Q2) is a<br>
npn-type bipolar junction transistor (BJT) that has<br>
a second control end (B) connected electrically to the<br>
first output end (D) and the first resistors (R10) of<br>
the second bias unit, a second input end (C) connected<br>
electrically to the first control end (G) and the first<br>
bias unit, and a second output end (E) that is grounded.<br>
The second control end (B) is the base of the bipolar<br>
junction transistor, the second input end (C) is the<br>
collector, and the second output end (E) is the emitter.<br><br>
7<br>
In practice, a MOSFET may be used for the second switch<br>
(Q2) in other embodiments of this invention. However,<br>
since the conduction voltage required by the npn-type<br>
bipolar junction transistor is smaller than that of<br>
the MOSFET, which has a benefit of reducing power loss<br>
attributed to the first resistors (R10), the npn-type<br>
bipolar junction transistor is used for the second<br>
switch (Q2) in the preferred embodiment of this<br>
invention.<br>
The first resistors (R10) of the second bias unit<br>
are connected in parallel, are connected electrically<br>
at one end to the first output end (S) and the second<br>
control end (B) , and are further connected electrically<br>
at another end to the second output end (E) , which is<br>
grounded. The second resistor (R20) of the voltage<br>
divider of the first bias unit is connected electrically<br>
at one end to the electric power source 4 via one of<br>
the protective components 12 and to the brake device<br>
5 via another of the protective components 12. The second<br>
resistor (R20) is further connected electrically in<br>
series at another end to one end of the third resistor<br>
(R30). The first control end (G) and the second input<br>
end (C) are connected electrically to a junction of<br>
the second and third resistors (R20, R30). The third<br>
resistor (R30) is further connected electrically at<br>
another end to the second output end (E), which is<br>
grounded. The first capacitor (C1) is shunted to the<br><br>
8<br>
third resistor (R30) for noise filtering.<br>
The brightness increasing unit 3 is connected<br>
electrically to the brake device 5 and the current<br>
limiting unit 2, and includes fourth and fifth resistors<br>
(R4, R5) that form a voltage divider of a third bias<br>
unit, a second capacitor (C2), a plurality of coupling<br>
resistors (R6), and a third switch (Q3).<br>
The fourth resistor (R4) is connected electrically<br>
at one end to the brake device 5 via one of the protective<br>
components 12, and is further connected electrically<br>
at the other end to the fifth resistor (R5) and the<br>
second capacitor (C2). The fifth resistor (R5) is<br>
connected in parallel to the second capacitor (C2),<br>
and the fifth resistor (R5) and the second capacitor<br>
(C2) are grounded at one end. The coupling resistors<br>
(R6) are connected in parallel, and the<br>
parallel-connected coupling resistors (R6) are<br>
connected electrically at one end to the first output<br>
end (S) and the second control end (B) , and are further<br>
connected electrically at another end to the third<br>
switch (Q3) . In this embodiment, the third switch (Q3)<br>
is a n-channel depletion-type MOSFET, and has a third<br>
control end (G) connected electrically to a junction<br>
of the fourth and fifth resistors (R4, R5), a third<br>
input end (D) connected electrically to the coupling<br>
resistors (R6), and a third output end (S) connected<br>
electrically to the second output end (E), which is<br><br>
9<br>
grounded. The third control end (G) is the gate, the<br>
third input end (D) is the drain, and the third output<br>
end (S) is the source of the MOSFET.<br>
In operation, when the electric power source 4<br>
provides the drive voltage (V1) to the voltage divider<br>
of the first bias unit, a voltage sufficient to cause<br>
the first switch (Q1) to conduct will be present at<br>
the first control end (G), such that the first switch<br>
(Ql) makes an electrical circuit between the light<br>
emitting unit 1 and the electric power source 4 to result<br>
in current flow from the electric power source 4 through<br>
the current limiting resistors (R) , the first and second<br>
light emitting components (D1, D2), the first switch<br>
(Ql) , and the first resistors (R10) of the second bias<br>
unit, thereby activating the first and second light<br>
emitting components (Dl, D2) of the light emitting<br>
modules 11 of the light emitting unit 1 to emit light.<br>
When the drive voltage (V1) fluctuates such that<br>
the amount of current flowing through the first switch<br>
(Ql) exceeds a predetermined threshold, the voltage<br>
across the first resistors (R10) reaches 0 . 7 volt, which<br>
is sufficient to cause the second switch (Q2) conduct.<br>
Conduction of the second switch (Q2) forces the first<br>
switch (Ql) to turn off so as to break the electrical<br>
circuit between the light emitting unit 1 and the<br>
electric power source 4, thereby interrupting the<br>
current flow through the light emitting unit 1 so as<br><br>
10<br>
to deactivate the first and second light emitting<br>
components (D1, D2) of the light emitting modules 11<br>
of the light emitting unit 1.<br>
When the current flow through the light emitting<br>
unit 1 is interrupted, the voltage at the second control<br>
end (B) will become lower than the conduction voltage<br>
required by the second switch (Q2), thereby turning<br>
off the second switch (Q2) so that the voltage at the<br>
first control end (G) is once again sufficient to cause<br>
the first switch (Ql) to conduct. When the first switch<br>
(Ql) conducts, the electrical circuit between the light<br>
emitting unit 1 and the electric power source 4 is made<br>
so that the first and second light emitting components<br>
(Dl, D2) of the light emitting modules 11 of the light<br>
emitting unit 1 are activated to emit light once more.<br>
Therefore, due to alternating switching of the first<br>
and second switches (Ql, Q2), the amount of current<br>
flowing through the light emitting modules 11 of the<br>
light emitting unit 1 can be regulated.<br>
In this embodiment, when the brake of the vehicle<br>
is operated, the brake device 5 outputs the braking<br>
voltage (V2) that is received by the third bias unit.<br>
The braking voltage (V2) is divided by the fourth and<br>
fifth resistors (R4, R5) of the voltage divider of the<br>
third bias unit such that the voltage at the third<br>
control end (G) is sufficient to cause the third switch<br>
(Q3) to conduct. When the third switch (Q3) conducts,<br><br>
11<br>
the coupling resistors (R6) are connected in parallel<br>
to the first resistors (R10) to result in a lower<br>
equivalent resistance. As a result, a larger amount<br>
of electric current is required to flow through the<br>
first output end (S) before the second switch (Q2)<br>
conducts. In other words, by connecting the coupling<br>
resistors (R6) in parallel to the first resistors (R10),<br>
the predetermined threshold is reconfigured so as to<br>
allow a larger amount of current to flow through the<br>
light emitting unit 1 and the first switch (Q1) before<br>
the second switch (Q2) conducts. The larger amount of<br>
current flowing through the first and second light<br>
emitting components (D1, D2) results in increased<br>
brightness in the light emitted thereby. Therefore,<br>
when the brake is operated, the brightness increasing<br>
unit 3 enables the first and second light emitting<br>
components (Dl, D2) to emit brighter light for good<br>
braking warning indication.<br>
In sum, when electric current not exceeding the<br>
predetermined threshold flows through the first and<br>
second light emitting components (Dl, D2) of the light<br>
emitting modules 11 of the light emitting unit 1, the<br>
first switch (Ql) conducts while the second switch (Q2)<br>
is turned off. On the other hand, when electric current<br>
exceeding the predetermined threshold flows through<br>
the first and second light emitting components (Dl,<br>
D2), the second switch (Q2) conducts so as to turn off<br><br>
12<br>
the first switch (Q1), thereby interrupting current<br>
flow through the light emitting unit 1. Through<br>
alternating switching of the first and second switches<br>
(Ql, Q2) , the electric current flowing through the light<br>
emitting unit 1 can be regulated even when the drive<br>
voltage (V1) of the electric power source 4 is unstable<br>
and fluctuates wildly. The switching design employed<br>
in the present invention can prevent components thereof<br>
from operating continuously to prevent overheating.<br>
That is, the components of the present invention are<br>
permitted to operate at a lower operating temperature<br>
to result in advantages of higher stability and a longer<br>
service life.<br><br>

connected electrically to said third switch (Q3) and<br>
adapted to receive a braking voltage (V2),<br>
said coupling resistor (R6) being connected<br>
electrically at one end to said first output end (S)<br>
and said second control end (B), and being further<br>
connected electrically at another end to said third<br>
switch (Q3),<br>
said third switch (Q3) having a third control end<br>
(G) connected electrically to said third bias unit,<br>
a third input end (D) connected electrically to said<br>
coupling resistor (R6), and a third output end (S)<br>
connected electrically to said second output end (E) ,<br>
said third bias unit causing said third switch (Q3)<br>
to conduct when the braking voltage (V2) is provided<br>
to said third bias unit such that said third switch<br>
(Q3) connects said coupling resistor (R6) in parallel<br>
to said first resistor (R10), thereby reconfiguring<br>
the predetermined threshold so as to allow a larger<br>
amount of current to flow through said light emitting<br>
unit (1) and said first switch (Q1) before said second<br>
switch (Q2) conducts.<br>
7. The current-regulated light emitting device as<br>
claimed in claim 1, wherein said light emitting module<br>
(11) further has a current limiting resistor (R) adapted<br>
for connecting electrically said light emitting<br>
component (D1, D2) to the electric power source (4).<br><br>
A current-regulated light emitting device for<br>
vehicle use includes a light emitting unit (1) and a<br>
current limiting unit (2). The current limiting unit<br>
(2) includes first and second switches (Q1, Q2) and<br>
first and second bias units. The first switch (Q1) is<br>
for making and breaking an electrical circuit between<br>
the light emitting unit (1) and an electric power source<br>
(4) . The first bias unit is for causing the first switch<br>
(Q1) to conduct so as to activate the light emitting<br>
unit (1) when the first bias unit receives a drive<br>
voltage (V1) from the electric power source (4). The<br>
second bias unit is for causing the second switch (Q2)<br>
to conduct when amount of current flowing through the<br>
first switch (Q1) exceeds a predetermined threshold,<br>
thereby turning off the first switch (Q1) to interrupt<br>
current flow through the light emitting unit (1).<br></td>
