The ras protein in its normal, unmutated form is a key element of the signal transduction cascade directed by growth factor receptors in almost all tissues. See J. Avruch et aL, TIBS (19), 279-283 (1994). Biochemically, ras is a guanine nucleotide binding protein, and cycling between a GTP-bound activated and a GDP-bound resting form is strictly controlled by ras' endogenous GTPase activity and other regulatory proteins. In the ras mutants in cancer cells, the endogenous GTPase activity is activated and, therefore, the protein delivers constitutive growth signals to downstream effectors such as the enzyme raf kinase. This leads to the cancerous growth of the cells which carry these mutants, Magnuson et aL, Cancer Biology, 5, 247-253 (1994). It has been shown that inhibiting the effect of active ras by inhibiting the raf kinase signaling pathway by administration of antisense RNA or by small molecule Raf kinase inhibitors leads to the reversion of transformed cells to the normal growth phenotype, Sridhar et aL, Mol Cancer Ther 2005, 4(4), April 2005 and Bollag et aL, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 4, vol 12, 2003.<br>
The present invention provides 4-amino-thieno [3,2-c] pyridine-7-carboxylic acid derivatives which are small molecule inhibitors of Raf kinase. In addition to inhibiting Raf, these compounds may also inhibit some other important kinases including ABL, BRAF, BRAF(V600E) mutant, EPHA, EPHB, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FLT3, FLT4, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and VEFGR-2. These compounds can be potent and selective anticancer agents, especially agents for the treatment of colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, bladder, ovarian, melanoma, neuroblastoma, cervical, kidney or renal cancers, leukemias or lymphomas.<br><br>

The ras protein in its normal, unmutated form is a key element of the signal transduction cascade directed by growth factor receptors in almost all tissues. See J. Avruch et aL, TIBS (19), 279-283 (1994). Biochemically, ras is a guanine nucleotide binding protein, and cycling between a GTP-bound activated and a GDP-bound resting form is strictly controlled by ras' endogenous GTPase activity and other regulatory proteins. In the ras mutants in cancer cells, the endogenous GTPase activity is activated and, therefore, the protein delivers constitutive growth signals to downstream effectors such as the enzyme raf kinase. This leads to the cancerous growth of the cells which carry these mutants, Magnuson et aL, Cancer Biology, 5, 247-253 (1994). It has been shown that inhibiting the effect of active ras by inhibiting the raf kinase signaling pathway by administration of antisense RNA or by small molecule Raf kinase inhibitors leads to the reversion of transformed cells to the normal growth phenotype, Sridhar et aL, Mol Cancer Ther 2005, 4(4), April 2005 and Bollag et aL, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 4, vol 12, 2003.<br>
The present invention provides 4-amino-thieno [3,2-c] pyridine-7-carboxylic acid derivatives which are small molecule inhibitors of Raf kinase. In addition to inhibiting Raf, these compounds may also inhibit some other important kinases including ABL, BRAF, BRAF(V600E) mutant, EPHA, EPHB, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FLT3, FLT4, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and VEFGR-2. These compounds can be potent and selective anticancer agents, especially agents for the treatment of colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, bladder, ovarian, melanoma, neuroblastoma, cervical, kidney or renal cancers, leukemias or lymphomas.<br><br>
