				<td>FUNCTIONAL SAFETY GLAZING UNIT<br>
The present invention relates to glazing units having a dual feature:<br>
Ø on the one hand, it involves glazing units known as safety glazing units, in the<br>
sense that they are capable of retaining splinters (especially glass splinters) in the<br>
event of breakage. It especially involves glazing units according to European<br>
standard ECE R43 or American standard ANSI Z26.1. These glazing units preferably<br>
successfully pass both tests described in these standards by the terms "ball drop"<br>
and "phantom drop". The more standard configuration of this type of glazing unit is<br>
that of standard laminated glazing units, consisting of two essentially transparent<br>
rigid substrates (usually made of glass) between which at least one thermoplastic<br>
polymer sheet is placed, which will ensure the retention of glass splinters if need<br>
be. In a known manner, the lamination generally requires heating, generally under<br>
pressure, of the three assembled elements, so as to soften and make adherent the<br>
thermoplastic sheet and possibly to remove the residual air between the various<br>
elements of the glazing unit.<br>
It may also involve laminated glazing units where the intermediate sheet is<br>
based on a single- or double-sided adhesive polymer of the elastomer type, which<br>
avoids the hot lamination operation mentioned above.<br>
The invention also includes laminated glazing units called "asymmetrical"<br>
units, using a single rigid substrate of glass type combined with several polymer<br>
sheets, of which generally at least one is based on polyurethane (as described, for<br>
example, in patents EP 132 198, EP 131 523 and EP 389 354).<br>
It also includes safety glazing units where the function of retaining splinters<br>
is obtained by a plastic film, especially the superposition of a polyvinyl butyral-<br>
type thermoplastic sheet and of a protective polymer sheet of the polyethylene<br>
terephthalate PET type, which is made to adhere to a rigid glass-type substrate.<br>
This type of plastic film is, for example, marketed bv DuPont de Nemours under<br>
the name "Spalled Shield" or under other commercial names by "3M" or by<br>
"Southwall. This polymer sheet may possibly be transparent to electromagnetic<br>
waves. This is the same for the product marketed by 3M which is an assembly of a<br>
complex of at least two thermoplastic sheets f"1 and f"1, it being possible for the<br>
natures and the thicknesses of each of these sheets to be different depending on<br>
the sought applications.<br>
Ø on the other hand, the glazing units according to the invention are "functional",<br>
in the sense that they have at least one functionality conferred by one or more thin<br>
layers and/or one or more discontinuous elements which may be of organic,<br>
mineral or organo-mineral hybrid nature (these layers or elements generally being<br>
placed against one of the rigid substrates of the glazing units according to the<br>
invention). They will be denoted hereinafter by the term "active system(s)". The<br>
glazing units according to the invention may comprise one or more thereof.<br>
The first types of active system benefiting the invention are electrochemical<br>
systems in general, and more particularly, electrically controllable systems of the<br>
glazing unit type with variable optical and/or energy properties.<br>
In particular, electrically controllable systems make it possible to obtain<br>
glazing units the darkening/degree of vision or of filtration of the thermal/solar<br>
radiation of which can be modified at will. For example, it involves viologen glazing<br>
units, which make it possible to adjust the light transmission or absorption, like the<br>
ones described in patent US-5 239 406.<br>
Electroluminescent systems directly convert the electrical energy into light,<br>
one example being described in patent FR-2 770 222.<br>
There are also electrochromic glazing units, which make it possible to alter<br>
the light and heat transmission. They are especially described in patents EP-<br>
253 713 and EP-670 346, the electrolyte being in the form of a polymer or a gel and<br>
the other layers being of mineral type. Another type is described in patents EP-<br>
867 752, EP-831 360, PCT/FR00/00675 and WO 00/03289, the electrolyte being on<br>
this occasion in the form of a mainly mineral layer, all the layers of the system<br>
then mainly being mineral: this type of electrochromic system is commonly<br>
denoted by the term "all-solid" electrochromic system. There are also<br>
electrochromic systems where all the layers are of polymer type, then referred to<br>
as an "all-polymer" electrochromic system.<br>
In general, electrochromic systems comprise two layers of electrochromic<br>
material separated by an electrolyte layer and surrounded by two electrically<br>
conducting layers.<br>
There are also systems called "optical valves": they involve polymer-based<br>
films in which microdroplets containing particles capable of aligning in a favored<br>
direction under the action of an electrical field are placed. One example thereof is<br>
described in patent WO 93/09460.<br>
There are also liquid crystal systems, with an operating mode similar to the<br>
aforementioned: they use a polymer film placed between two conducting layers<br>
and in which droplets of liquid crystals, especially nematic crystals with a positive<br>
dielectric anisotropy, are dispersed. When a voltage is applied to the film, the<br>
liquid crystals are oriented along a favored axis, which allows vision. With no<br>
voltage, the film becomes diffusing. Examples thereof are described in patents EP-<br>
88 126, EP-268 877, EP-238 164, EP-357 234, EP-409 442 and EP-964 288. Mention<br>
may also be made of cholesteric liquid crystal polymers, like those described in<br>
patent WO 92/19695 and liquid crystal systems which switch with a variation in<br>
light transmission TL.<br>
A second type of active system benefiting the invention relates to layers or<br>
stacks of layers the properties of which alter without an electrical power supply,<br>
under the effect of heat or light: mention may be made of thermochromic layers,<br>
especially vanadium oxide-based layers (one example thereof is given in the French<br>
patent filed on May 23, 2000 with application number FR 00/06585), thermotropic<br>
layers and photochromic layers.<br>
Photovoltaic systems, which convert light energy into electrical energy, may<br>
also be involved.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention and throughout the present text,<br>
the term "layer" must be understood in its broadest sense: it may equally well<br>
involve minerals as organic-type materials, most particularly polymers, which may<br>
be in the form of polymer films or even gel films. This is especially the case for<br>
thermotropic gels, for example those described in patents EP-639 450,<br>
US 5 615 040, WO 94/20294 and EP-878 296.<br>
A third type of active system benefiting the invention relates to the layers or<br>
stacks of layers with low-emissivity solar control properties, especially based on<br>
one or more silver layers interleaved by dielectric layers. These stacks may be<br>
deposited on one of the rigid substrates or be deposited on a flexible substrate of<br>
the PET (polyethylene terephthalate) type that is placed between two sheets made<br>
of a thermoplastic polymer of the PVB (polyvinyl butyral) type used to assemble<br>
the two rigid substrates of the glass type. Examples thereof are found in patents<br>
EP-638 528, EP-718 250, EP-724 955, EP-758 583 and EP-847 965.<br>
Finally, mention may also be made of coatings with an acoustic function<br>
(acoustic attenuation), and with an optical function (decorative, absorbent, etc).<br>
The design of glazing units having the dual feature described above is not<br>
simple, since combining an active system with polymer sheets having a splinter-<br>
retaining function in a glazing unit creates additional stresses. Thus, if an active<br>
system is inserted, for example an electrochromic system, in a conventional<br>
laminated glazing unit between the glass and the interleaved polymer film, the<br>
adherence of the polymer film to the glass tends to be decreased. There is<br>
therefore an increased risk that, should the glazing unit break, the great majority<br>
of the glass splinters can no longer be retained by the polymer film, as required by<br>
the standard.<br>
To guard against this, if the active system is placed on one of the outer faces<br>
of a standard laminated glazing unit, it is then necessary to provide means for<br>
protecting it from contact with the surrounding atmosphere, in order to protect it<br>
from chemical or mechanical damage. This then requires the use of an additional<br>
protective substrate. Now, a certain number of applications require a nominal<br>
thickness for the glazing unit, and it is not always possible to propose glazing units<br>
that are too thick. It is especially the case for sunroofs, where car-body builders<br>
generally fit laminated or tempered glass, whose overall thickness cannot exceed<br>
about 5 mm. This is also the case for roof glazing units for example, where the<br>
frame only allows the mounting of glazing units of a predefined thickness that is<br>
often imposed by the thermal insulation performance to be achieved.<br>
The aim of the invention is therefore to provide a new type of glazing unit<br>
which is able to reconcile compliance with safety standards with the presence of at<br>
least one of the active systems described above within the glazing unit. More<br>
particularly, it also aims to design such a glazing unit which, in addition, cannot be<br>
significantly penalized in terms of overall size when compared with a comparable<br>
standard safety glazing unit. This last point is clearly an asset when aiming for the<br>
spare parts market.<br>
First of all, the subject of the invention is a glazing unit, successively<br>
comprising:<br>
Ü a first rigid substrate S1,<br>
Ü a second rigid substrate S2,<br>
Ü a third rigid, semi-rigid or flexible substrate S3,<br>
Ü at least one "active" system A comprising at least one layer and placed between<br>
the substrates S1 and S2 or between the substrates S2 and S3,<br>
Ü the third substrate S3 being set back with respect to the other two substrates S1<br>
and S2,<br>
Ü a polymer film having the function of retaining splinters in the event of breakage<br>
of the glazing unit being placed between the substrate S1 and the substrate S2<br>
and/or between the substrate S2 and the substrate S3 and/or forming part of the<br>
substrate S3.<br>
The invention therefore focuses on a type of glazing unit making it possible<br>
to reconcile safety, functionality and sizing.<br>
The glazing comprises the polymer film having a splinter-retaining function<br>
which is essential for obtaining the desired safety level in the event of breakage of<br>
the glazing unit. Its positioning in the glazing unit may then be selected depending<br>
on that of the active system which functionalizes the glazing unit: if the active<br>
system is between the substrate S1 and the substrate S2, the polymer film in<br>
question will preferably be between the substrate S2 and the substrate S3, or will<br>
be part of the substrate S3. On the other hand, if the active system is between the<br>
substrate S2 and the substrate S3, the polymer film in question will preferably be<br>
between the substrate S1 and S2. Advantageously, direct contact between the<br>
active system and the polymer film intended to retain most of the splinters can<br>
also be avoided. Thus, it is ensured that the presence of the active system in the<br>
glazing unit does not interfere with the adherability of the polymer film to its rigid<br>
carrier substrate or substrates of the glass type.<br>
Of course, this does not exclude the presence of a second polymer film<br>
having a splinter-retaining function and in contact with the active system: this<br>
other film may contribute to the safety of the glazing unit, but this role is mainly<br>
dedicated to the film which is not in contact with the active system. Thus, by<br>
physically separating the splinter-retaining film and the active system, they are<br>
made to coexist in the glazing unit without one undermining the functionality of<br>
the other. However, the price for this solution is that the glazing unit contains<br>
three substrates rather than two. More particularly where it involves three rigid<br>
glass substrates, it is clear that this leads to a glazing unit which overall is thicker<br>
than a standard two-pane laminated glazing unit. It is for this reason that the<br>
invention proposes that the substrate S3 is set back from the other two: by having<br>
a smaller size, it thus leaves a peripheral region free on the perimeter of the<br>
substrate S2. If this glazing unit has to be inserted into a frame, in bodywork (some<br>
configurations will be detailed hereinafter), this will take place as if the glazing<br>
unit had only two rigid substrates S1 and S2: it will be possible to mount the glazing<br>
unit while holding it, by fastening it only over the periphery of these two<br>
substrates. The third set-back substrate will be held against the previous ones by<br>
the usual techniques detailed below (lamination, use of an adhesive), and there<br>
will be no need for the method of fastening the glazing unit to clasp it over its<br>
periphery as well. This point is most particularly advantageous when the glazing<br>
unit is intended to be a sunroof, where generally a peripheral mounting is provided<br>
for tempered monolithic glazing units or laminations not thicker than 4 or 5 mm<br>
(these standard thickness ranges being used for glazing units without an "active<br>
system" in the sense of the invention, that are generally single pane).<br>
The glazing unit according to the invention, even in its three-pane<br>
configuration, is capable of being mounted without any problem as a standard<br>
sunroof in a vehicle body, by virtue of this particular sizing of the third pane. Even<br>
where S3 is a substrate formed from one or more superimposed polymer films (such<br>
as the PET/PVB film mentioned in the preamble), their thickness is not negligible.<br>
Furthermore, the fact that S3 is made of plastic and not of glass may present<br>
problems of mounting/peripheral sealing compared to standard two-pane<br>
laminated glazing units. Here again, the fact that S3 is smaller makes it possible, as<br>
need be, to preserve the mounting/the method of placing the usual peripheral seal<br>
of the laminated windows.<br>
The invention is therefore very flexible in its implementation, depending on<br>
the envisioned application, of standard products whether or not it has to come<br>
close in terms of thickness or of type of material/sealing or peripheral fastening.<br>
The active system according to the invention may be of electrically<br>
controllable type, with variable energy and/or optical properties of the<br>
electrochromic system, optical valve, viologen system, liquid crystal system,<br>
electroluminescent system type. Details concerning them have been given in the<br>
preamble of the present application.<br>
The active system according to the invention may also be without an<br>
electrical supply, for example having a thermal function (low emissivity, solar<br>
protection), an acoustic function (acoustic attenuation) or an optical function<br>
(decorative, absorbent, etc). It may also involve thermochromic or thermotropic<br>
coatings, as was mentioned in the preamble of this present application (note that<br>
thermochromic layers may also optionally be supplied with current, so that they<br>
may be deliberately heated by resistance heating and change optical/thermal<br>
properties as desired, and not just as dictated by the ambient sunshine).<br>
According to one variant of the invention, the substrates S1 and S2 are made<br>
of glass. As for the substrate S3, this may also be made of glass or of a polymer-<br>
based material. This polymer may be in the form of a relatively rigid substrate, of<br>
the polycarbonate PC or polymethyl methacrylate PMMA type. This material is then<br>
substituted for the glass, if for example it is sought to lighten the glazing unit as a<br>
whole. This material may also be semi-rigid or flexible, and it may form the film<br>
capable of retaining splinters in the event of breakage, as mentioned above.<br>
According to one variant of the invention, the glazing unit according to the<br>
invention comprises at least one thermoplastic polymer sheet, having the function<br>
of retaining splinters in the event of breakage of the glazing unit, between the<br>
substrates S1 and S2 and/or between the substrates S2 and S3 (this last scenario,<br>
when S3 is a rigid substrate). If there are several sheets (or superposition of sheets)<br>
of thermoplastic polymer, it is therefore the one which is not in contact with the<br>
active system of the electrochromic type which will play the essential safety role.<br>
According to a preferred example of the invention, the three substrates S1,<br>
S2, S3 are made of glass and laminated to each other by thermoplastic polymer<br>
sheets.<br>
If the faces of the panes are renumbered from the outside toward the inside<br>
(by considering the glazing unit once it is mounted in the automobile or in the<br>
building), it is possible to have, for example, an active system of the<br>
electrochromic type on faces 3, 4 or 5 of panes S1, S2 or S3 depending on the case,<br>
and it is the thermoplastic inserted sheet with which it is not in contact which<br>
confers safety on the glazing unit.<br>
Returning to the previous configuration where the substrate S3 is a film or a<br>
superposition of polymer films, it may adhere to the substrate S2 on a face which<br>
may or may not be provided with an active system according to the invention,<br>
directly or via an adhesive.<br>
The active system A may be on the outer 3 or inner 4 face of the substrate<br>
S2 or on the outer face 5 of the substrate S3, using the convention for numbering<br>
faces mentioned above-<br>
Advantageously, the total thickness (e1 + e2) of the substrates St and S2 and<br>
of all the other materials likely to be placed between them (thermoplastic sheets,<br>
elastomer sheet, active system, etc.) is less than or equal to 8 mm, especially less<br>
than or equal to 5.5 mm, preferably between 2 mm and 5 mm. These thicknesses<br>
accommodate the majority of requirements if the glazing unit is for equipping a<br>
vehicle of the car type, or if it involves glazing units for a building of the roof<br>
glazing unit type.<br>
Preferably, the substrates SI and S2 are of substantially identical dimensions<br>
and the substrate S3 is of smaller dimensions and positioned with respect to the<br>
substrate S2 so as to delimit an open peripheral groove having a depth p of at least<br>
5 mm, especially at least 8 mm, preferably between 10 and 25 mm.<br>
Advantageously, this groove is of constant depth over the entire perimeter of the<br>
substrates S2 and S3 delimiting it: thus, S3 is preferably centered with respect to<br>
S2, S3 having an outline identical to S2, but of smaller proportions.<br>
With regard to the size of the active system A, its active surface is<br>
preferably of dimensions similar to or less than those of the third substrate S3. The<br>
term "active surface" refers to the surface which effectively has the desired<br>
functionality, in particular excluding the peripheral inactive regions used for the<br>
connections. If the active system is one of the faces of the substrate S3, this<br>
dimensioning is compulsory. If however it is on one face of the substrate S1 or S2,<br>
this dimensioning makes it possible for the active system to be better matched to<br>
the central region of the glazing unit which will effectively be exposed to view,<br>
and not the peripheral region of the substrates S1 and S2 which "go beyond" the<br>
substrate S3 and which, for esthetic reasons, will therefore generally be masked.<br>
According to an advantageous variant of the invention, provision is made for<br>
the glazing unit to be fitted effectively with an opacifying peripheral coating, of<br>
the screen-printing type, especially on the periphery of the inner face 2 of the<br>
substrate S1 and/or on the periphery of the outer 3 or inner 4 face of the substrate<br>
S3, still using the same conventions. It may involve enamel-based coatings, which<br>
are moreover well known for automobile glazing units: these coatings may have<br>
several functions: hiding the connections of the electrically controllable active<br>
system, hiding the peripheral region of the glazing unit where the substrate S3 is<br>
absent, hiding a nontransparent function (electroluminescent system), having a<br>
decorative function, etc.<br>
The half-open peripheral groove mentioned above and created in the glazing<br>
unit because of the setting-back of the substrate S3 may be used in different ways,<br>
and be exploited in a very advantageous manner. Of course, it will make it possible<br>
to fasten the glazing unit to its frame just by fastening substrates S1 and S2. But<br>
this free space may also make it possible, for example, for elements connecting<br>
the active system to pass therethrough, when the latter is electrically controllable.<br>
The particular configuration of the glazing unit according to the invention<br>
makes it possible for different positionings of the peripheral seals where they are<br>
necessary. This is especially the case where the glazing unit contains active<br>
systems which are (very) sensitive to moisture, and to contact with the surrounding<br>
atmosphere in general. The position of the seal is then conditioned by that of the<br>
active system, the aim being that it is correctly sealed. Thus, if the active system<br>
is between the substrate S2 and the substrate S3, at least one seal will be useful on<br>
the periphery of S2 and S3, but not necessarily between S1 and S2. Provision may<br>
be made for several seals which are complementary in their function (one, a<br>
barrier against water vapor, the other against liquid water, for example). At least<br>
one seal is preferably provided on the edge of the substrate S1 and/or of the<br>
substrate S2, and/or that of the substrate S3, especially between S2 and S3 as seen<br>
above if the active system is between the substrate S2 and S3: either only on the<br>
edges of the two substrates and therebetween, or going beyond the face of thes<br>
two substrates (or of one of them). Preferably, ft involves the face which is awa<br>
from the one turned toward the active system.<br>
Various techniques may be used in order to make this peripheral seal o<br>
these peripheral seals. They can be attached, using premanufactured seats in the<br>
form of a bead (which are placed by softening them, by slight heating, fo<br>
example, so that they may create the leaktightness sought on the edges of th<br>
substrates in question). They may also be extruded, the technique for extrudin<br>
seals already being used in particular to make windscreen seals, as is described in<br>
patents EP 479 677 and EP 524 060.<br>
They can also be made by an encapsulation technique. This generall<br>
involves a technique denoted by the term RIM (Reactive Injection Molding), when<br>
a polymer, which is generally potyurethane at low pressure and at a not very high<br>
temperature, is injected into a dosed mold closely following the storyteller of the<br>
glazing unit (substrates SI, S2 and possibly S2 for the glazing unit of the invention)<br>
This technique is especially described in patent FR00/012398 filed on Septembe<br>
29,2000.<br>
Advantageously, the peripheral seal used (or at least one of them) is flusl<br>
with the outer face 1 of the first substrate S1. This type of mounting is particular!<br>
esthetic, since it provides a continuity of surface with the bodywork and the franx<br>
surrounding the glazing unit. The peripheral seal(s) may advantageously fill, a<br>
least in part, the half-open peripheral groove described above. It may also be<br>
traversed by elements for connecting the active system A if it is electrically<br>
controllable. It may also contain mechanical strengthening elements (mounts<br>
balls, frame, etc), as is especially described in patent FR 00/13307 filed on Octobe<br>
18, 2000 and relating to seals.<br>
The subject of the invention is, more particularly, the embodiment when<br>
the glazing unit is a triple glazing unit, with three panes S1, S2, S3 and double<br>
lamination, fitted with an all-solid electrochromic system preferably placed on the<br>
outer face 3 of the second substrate S2: it is then the thermoplastic sheet between<br>
the substrates S2 and S3 which mainly assumes the safety function (splinte<br>
retention in the event of breakage).<br>
The subject of the invention is all the applications of the glazing unit:<br>
described above, especially for the building as roof glazing or for the automotive<br>
industry as a sunroof (opening or nonopening).<br>
The subject of the invention is also the automobile equipped in this way,<br>
preferably with the glazing unit(s) according to the invention being flush with the<br>
bodywork.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with the aid of nontimiting<br>
examples illustrated by the following figures:<br>
¦ figures 1 to 5: part of a glazing unit according to the invention seen in<br>
section, according to five different variants.<br>
¦ figure 6: a glazing unit according to the invention, in section, seen as a<br>
whole.<br>
The figures are deliberately very schematic and are not necessarily to scale,<br>
in order to facilitate their reading.<br>
EXAMPLES 1 to 5:<br>
The following examples 1 to 5, illustrated respectively by figures 1 to 5, all<br>
relate to an automobile roof glazing unit. It comprises successively, from the<br>
outside toward the inside of the passenger compartment, three panes S1, S2, S3,<br>
which are clear (they may also be tinted) silica-soda-lime panes having a thickness<br>
of 1.6, 2.1 and 1.6 mm, respectively.<br>
Figure 6 shows the most important feature of the glazing unit according to<br>
the invention: the panes S3 is smaller than the other two panes S1 and S2 and set<br>
back from them.<br>
The panes S1 and S2 have the same size and the same rectangular shape.<br>
Their dimensions are 900 x 500 mm2.<br>
The pane S1 may have, on face 2, a stack of thin layers with a sun protection<br>
function.<br>
The pane S3 is smaller than the other two, centered with respect to S2 and<br>
having dimensions 875 x 475 mm2.<br>
This configuration leaves an open peripheral groove g of variable depth p<br>
depending on the examples.<br>
The pane S1 is laminated to the pane S2 by a thermoplastic sheet f 1 made of<br>
polyurethane (PU) having a thickness of 0.8 mm (it may be replaced by a sheet of<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) or of polyvinyl butyral (PVB).<br>
An active system A is placed on the face 3 of the glazing unit, that is to say<br>
the outermost face of the pane SZ. The active system is an all-sotid electrochromic<br>
system, consisting of the stack of the following layers (starting from face 3 of the<br>
pane S2):<br>
Ü a lower conducting layer 2, which is a bilayer consisting of a first 30 nm SiOxNy<br>
layer surmounted by a second 250 nm ITO (tin-doped indium oxide) layer,<br>
Ü a second layer of anodic electrochromic material made of 40 to 100 nm of<br>
(hydrated) indium oxide or 40 nm to 400 nm of hydrated nickel oxide, which layer<br>
may or may not be alloyed with other metals,<br>
Ü a layer consisting of 100 nm of tungsten oxide,<br>
Ü a second layer consisting of 100 nm of hydrated tantalum oxide or of hydrated<br>
silica oxide or of hydrated zirconium oxide,<br>
Ü a second layer of cathodic electrochromic material, based on 370 nm of tungsten<br>
oxide WO3,<br>
Ü a top conducting layer consisting of 100 to 300 nm of ITO.<br>
All these layers are deposited in a known manner by magnetic-field<br>
enhanced reactive sputtering.<br>
The connections and all the means used to supply the two electrically<br>
conducting layers with electricity will not be detailed. It is conventional and<br>
described in the patents mentioned in the preamble.<br>
In particular, it may include a network of conducting wires in contact with<br>
the top electrode, as described in patent PCT/FR00/0O675.<br>
The pane S2 and the pane S3 are laminated by a thermoplastic sheet f2<br>
made of PU or EVA or PVB with a thickness of 0.38 to 0.76 mm.<br>
The presence of the electrochromic system A on face 3 weakens the<br>
interface between the pane S2 and the thermoplastic sheet f1, which is no longer<br>
enough to guarantee the retention of splinters by the sheet f1 in the event of<br>
breakage: according to the invention, the thermoplastic sheet f2 will take over<br>
from the sheet f1 in this safety function. Reciprocally, if the active system is on<br>
face 4 or 5, it is again the sheet fi which will predominantly take on this function.<br>
It is also possible to have an alternative configuration, where the safety<br>
function is provided by a standard laminated glazing unit (S1 + f1 + S2) which is<br>
made functional by adding, by lamination with the sheet f2, a pane S3 fitted with<br>
an active system A, thereto.<br>
Of course, as mentioned above in the present text, the active system A can<br>
be combined with its counter-substrate (as opposed to its carrier substrate, the<br>
one on which it is deposited) not by lamination, but by combination with a polymer<br>
sheet of the elastomer type, by a single- or double-sided adhesive, etc.<br>
Example 1<br>
Figure 1 shows in section a portion of the three-pane glazing unit described<br>
above, in position as an sunroof with respect to its fastening system in the<br>
bodywork. It can be seen that the groove g has a depth p of 12 mm, and that the<br>
inner face 2 of the substrate SI is fitted over its periphery with a screen-printed<br>
opacifying coating r over a width approximately equal to the depth p of the groove<br>
g. The active system A (its active surface) has dimensions slightly less than those of<br>
the substrate S3.<br>
The figure shows the metal frame M to which the sunroof has to be fastened,<br>
with strengthened in the form of metal inserts M" which are to be adhesively<br>
bonded to the glazing unit via a bead of adhesive C1. Conducting wires fc, which<br>
are part of the connections for the electrochromic system A, and which then<br>
traverse the groove g, can be seen passing through along the edge of the glass S2:<br>
it has proved to be very practical to use this groove to make conducting wires pass<br>
from the outside toward the inside of the glazing unit (and of the passenger<br>
compartment).<br>
Example 2<br>
This refers to figure 2. Compared with figure 1, it can be seen that the<br>
setting-back of the pane S3 is larger: here, the groove has a depth p of 37 mm.<br>
There is also a screen-printed coating r" on the face 2 of the pane S1 which is also<br>
wider than the coating r in example 1, and which is about 37 mm, the same as the<br>
depth of the groove.<br>
The mechanical bond with the frame is now also provided on face 6 of the<br>
pane S3, with metal reinforcements M" fastened to the faces 4 and 6 by means of<br>
two beads of adhesive C"1 and C"2.<br>
Example 3<br>
Here again is the configuration of example 2 with regard to the 37 mm set-<br>
back of the pane S3. Here, an encapsulated seal J has been used, flush with the<br>
face 1 of the PU-based pane S1 and embedding the groove g (and in fact all the<br>
connections which pass therethrough).<br>
This seat also contains metal reinforcements M" and goes beyond the inner<br>
face 6 of the pane S3 for a thickness of about 2 mm. The shape of the<br>
reinforcements has been adapted so that they are more effective and that they<br>
combine the pane S3 at the mechanical bond of the glazing unit to the metal<br>
frame.<br>
Example 4<br>
Here again is the configuration of examples 2 and 3. The seal J is<br>
encapsulated as in example 3, but here it is not in contact with the pane S3,<br>
neither on one of its faces nor on its edge. Here, the seal does not entirely fill the<br>
groove.<br>
Example 5<br>
Here again is the configuration of example 3, but this time with more<br>
standard metal reinforcements M".<br>
in conclusion, the invention has developped a glazing unit where it is<br>
possible to obtain 100% of the quality expected from the active system that it<br>
contains and 100% of the safety function in particular required in the automotive<br>
industry, with a smaller overall size. If the examples are taken, it can in fact be<br>
seen that the glazing unit can be fastened to the bodywork on the panes S1 and S2,<br>
or over an overall thickness of 4.5 mm.<br>
Many other variants are possible: in particular, it is possible to substitute the<br>
thermoplastic sheet f2 and the pane S3 with a substrate S"3 solely based on polymer<br>
sheets, which may if need be provide the required safety function. In this case,<br>
even though the substrate S3 can be relatively thin (more so than a pane), it<br>
remains of benefit to set it back with respect to the panes S1 and S2 for two<br>
alternative or cumulative reasons:<br>
Ü on the one hand, its thickness may not be negligible (1 mm for example),<br>
Ü on the other hand, if it is made of plastic while the other two substrates are<br>
made of glass, it may be beneficial to be able to continue to use:<br>
- seals which are known for properly adhering to the glass for panes S1, S2 and<br>
the materials deposited between these two panes, by leaving "aside" the plastic<br>
substrate S3, the adherence of which to said seal may be judged insufficient (or<br>
the seal deposition technique of which is more suitable to glass than to thin plastic<br>
substrates),<br>
- the priming and encapsulation materials which are more suitable, in the same<br>
way, for the glass.<br>
By way of these variants, a glazing unit can be envisioned incorporating, either<br>
between the substrates (SI and S2) or between the substrates (S2 and S3) an active<br>
electroluminescent system of the organic type commonly called an OLED (Organic<br>
Light Emitting Diode) or PLED (Polymer Light Emitting Diode) system or of inorganic<br>
type and, in this case, commonly called a TFEL (Thin Film Electroluminescent)<br>
system.<br>
The glazing unit may also consist of the assembly of a glass or polymer substrate<br>
S3 which is attached by adhesive bonding to a traditional glazing unit consisting of<br>
two substrates (S1+S2), the substrate S3 being smaller than S1+S2 and set back<br>
from the latter and able to include a functionality which is not detrimental to the<br>
splinter-retaining function (for example a decorative or low emissivity function or<br>
the like). An active system of electrochromic type is inserted, during the<br>
manufacture of the above glazing unit, between S3 on the one hand, and S1+S2 on<br>
the other hand.<br>
As a variant of the preceding example, the substrate S2 is a polymer substrate<br>
with a low-emissivity function and possibly completed with a functionality of<br>
transparency to electromagnetic waves, S1 is a back pane, S3 is still set back from<br>
S1+S2 and an active system of electrochromic type is inserted between S3 and<br>
S1+S2.<br>
