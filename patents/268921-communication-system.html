				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a communication system for<br>
accessing a network via a group of first access paths of a first<br>
access technology and a group of second access paths of a second<br>
access technology, said second access technology being different<br>
from the first access technology. The application also relates to a<br>
method of network access via access paths of different access<br>
technology.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the field of communications it is known to provide systems in<br>
which a given device can obtain access to a network via access paths<br>
of differing access technology. This is shown schematically in<br>
Figure 2. A communication system 10, e.g. a wireless communication<br>
device such as a mobile telephone is able to communicate with<br>
stations 11 and 12 that provide communication paths 101, 102 of a<br>
first access technology, e.g. a GSM (Global System for Mobile<br>
Communication) connection, a WCDMA (Wideband CDMA) connection, a<br>
WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) connection,<br>
a WINNER (Wireless World Initiative New Radio) connection, a WLAN<br>
(Wireless Local Area Network) connection, etc. The communication<br>
system 10 can furthermore communicate with stations 13, 14 over<br>
communication paths 103, 104 that are of a different access<br>
technology than paths 101, 102. If the paths 101, 102 operate in<br>
accordance with one of the above-mentioned technologies, then the<br>
paths 103, 104 can be provided by any one of the other technologies.<br>
The communication system 10 accesses the network 15, e.g. a<br>
telephone network or a computer network, such as an intranet or the<br>
Internet via the paths 101-104.<br>
If the stations 11-14 and the communication system 10 are arranged<br>
in such a way that the communication system 10 can from one location<br>
access the network 15 via both an access path 101, 102 or 103, 104,<br>
then this leads to the problem of managing the selection of one or<br>
2<br><br>
more paths for conducting a communication session with the network<br>
15.<br>
The basic situation of having heterogeneous wireless technologies<br>
for communication in a given location has already been studied, e.g.<br>
in the context of so-called Ambient Networks (AN), see document ISD-<br>
2002-507134-AN/WB2/D02, MRA Architecture by Rolf Sigle et al,<br>
version 1.0, released February 2, 2005. The inventors of the present<br>
application are also authors/editors of this document, the contents<br>
of which is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
In the context of Ambient Networks it has been proposed to use so-<br>
called Multi-Radio Resource Management (MRRM) for managing the<br>
different access technologies. An MRRM functionality coordinates the<br>
different radio access technologies by mapping service requests on<br>
available radio resources for both single-and multi-hop links.<br>
Different MRRM objectives can be used e.g. maximizing radio resource<br>
efficiency, service coverage or service quality, or enabling<br>
services otherwise impossible to deliver over a single radio access.<br>
Intelligent load distribution algorithms inside MRRM increase the<br>
overall effective network capacity. MRRM functions include<br>
advertising, discovery, selection, resource monitoring, and spectrum<br>
and congestion control. By monitoring the access paths and obtaining<br>
status information related to access paths of different access<br>
technology, an access controller can select an access path for a<br>
communication session in accordance with a selection procedure and<br>
in dependence of the status information.<br>
Document EP 0 812 119 A2 discusses an improvement of the idle or<br>
standby mode in mobile stations of a cellular communication system.<br>
It is mentioned that the IS-136 and the GSM standard require an idle<br>
mobile station, i.e. a mobile station that is not in the process of<br>
conducting a communication session, to monitor control channels of<br>
neighbouring cells. EP 0 812 119 A2 proposes a different standby<br>
mode according to which when making measurements of a currently<br>
assigned control channel and other control channels, measurements of<br>
at least some of the other control channels can be terminated if it<br>
3<br><br>
is detected that the mobile station has become stationary. The<br>
latter can be done by measuring the received signal strength of a<br>
monitored neighbouring channel and comparing the temporal change in<br>
signal strength with a predetermined threshold. If the change in<br>
received signal strength falls below this threshold it is determined<br>
that the mobile station is stationary.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an improved communication<br>
system and method of accessing a network via groups of access paths<br>
of different access technology. It is noted that this object is not<br>
restricted to systems having wireless access technology, as the<br>
problem of making a selection between access paths of different<br>
technology will also occur if one or more of the groups of access<br>
paths are wire-bound.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is fulfilled by a communication system<br>
having the features of claim 1, a modifier having the features of<br>
claim 23, a method of controlling access to a network according to<br>
claim 24, and a computer program product of claim 25. Advantageous<br>
embodiments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
In accordance with the present invention a communication system<br>
arranged for accessing a network via a group of first access paths<br>
of a first access technology and a group of second access paths of a<br>
second access technology different from the first access technology<br>
is provided. The communication system can be a terminal, such as a<br>
mobile telephone capable of communication in accordance with a<br>
variety of wireless technologies, or the communication system can<br>
itself be a network, such as a Personal Area Network. The group of<br>
first access paths can have one or more members, and the group of<br>
second access paths can have one or more members. Naturally, the<br>
communication system can be arranged for accessing a network via<br>
more than two different types of access technologies.<br>
4<br><br>
An access path monitor is provided for obtaining status information<br>
related to a status of one or more of the first access paths and one<br>
or more of the second access paths in accordance with a monitoring<br>
procedure. The obtaining of information can e.g. be done by<br>
performing measurements on the access paths of interest, or can be<br>
obtained in other ways, e.g. received from the network. It is noted<br>
that the term "access path" describes any suitable access<br>
connection, e.g. a single link, a number of consecutive links, or an<br>
entire subnetwork.<br>
Furthermore, an access controller is provided for selecting an<br>
access path for a communication session from among the first and<br>
second access paths in accordance with a selection procedure and in<br>
dependence on the status information obtained by the access path<br>
monitor. The selecting preferably not only comprises the initial<br>
selection of one or more paths for a given session that is to be<br>
established, but also the subsequent switching of an established<br>
session from an access path of the first access technology to an<br>
access path of the second technology or vice versa, while the<br>
communication session is active.<br>
Furthermore, in accordance with the invention a modifier for<br>
modifying one or both of the monitoring procedure and the selection<br>
procedure in accordance with a modification procedure and in<br>
dependence on decision information is provided. The modifying can be<br>
done in any suitable or desirable way e.g. by changing parameters<br>
used by a procedure, e.g. the frequency at which status information<br>
is obtained. Modifying may also comprise changing a procedure or<br>
routine itself, e.g. by switching from one subroutine or mode to<br>
another.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the monitoring procedure<br>
and/or the selection procedure can be flexibly and dynamically<br>
adapted by the modification procedure. This provides an optimised<br>
management of the access paths of differing technology. More<br>
specifically, it is possible to control the modification in such a<br>
5<br><br>
way so as to optimise the trade-off between the costs (e.g. in terms<br>
of signalling overhead, energy consumption etc.) caused by the<br>
monitoring procedure and the benefit (e.g. in terms of improved<br>
quality of service) provided by the selection procedure. The<br>
balancing of cost and benefit can be done without actually<br>
calculating a cost value or a benefit value, e.g. by simply<br>
analysing a predetermined criterion for which the cost and benefit<br>
balance was previously established. An example of this is to stop<br>
the measurement of status information on access paths under<br>
observation if the power supply of the communication system is below<br>
a predetermined threshold and the signal quality on the active<br>
access path is above a predetermined threshold, as in such a case<br>
the cost in terms of energy is considered to outweigh any benefit in<br>
improved communication quality. On the other hand, it is also<br>
possible to explicitly calculate a cost value and/or a benefit<br>
value, e.g. based on mathematical functions or on appropriate look-<br>
up tables, and to then modify the monitoring and/or selection<br>
procedure in accordance with the cost value, benefit value or the<br>
relationship between the cost and benefit values.<br>
Brief description of figures<br>
These and further advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent from the following description of preferred<br>
embodiments, which makes reference to the enclosed figures in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of an embodiment of the<br>
present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows an arrangement of a communication system that can<br>
communicate with a network via a plurality of access<br>
paths; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of a method embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>

Detailed description of embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the present invention, where the<br>
inventive concept is applied to an ambient network scenario.<br>
Reference numeral 10 describes a communication system, which can be<br>
a single unit, like a mobile telephone device, or can be a system of<br>
distributed entities, like a personal area network. The<br>
communication system 10 is depicted schematically as comprising a<br>
plurality of connection entities 25-28, where each connection entity<br>
serves to establish one or more communication links in accordance<br>
with a different radio access technology. For example, connection<br>
entity 25 can be arranged for establishing a WLAN link, connection<br>
entity 26 can be arranged for establishing a WCDMA link, connection<br>
entity 27 can be arranged for establishing a WiMAX link and<br>
connection entity 28 can be arranged for establishing a WINNER link.<br>
Naturally, these are only examples, and more or less different<br>
wireless access technologies could be provided, and other wireless<br>
access technologies could be used instead of those indicated as<br>
examples.<br>
The communication system 10 has a Generic Link Layer (GLL) entity 24<br>
and a Multi-Radio Resource Management (MRRM) entity 200. The GLL<br>
entity 24 comprises generic functions which enable and facilitate<br>
efficient link-layer interworking among the diverse radio accesses<br>
25-28. The concept of GLL is well known in the art, such that a<br>
further description is not necessary. The MRRM entity provides a<br>
generic functionality for the management of the plurality of radio<br>
accesses 25-28. For this purpose, the MRRM entity 200 comprises an<br>
access controller 22. In accordance with the embodiment of the<br>
invention, an access path monitor 21 is also provided, which is<br>
arranged for obtaining status information related to a status of one<br>
or more access links 201-206 provided by the communication entities<br>
25-28. The controller 22 in accordance with the embodiment of the<br>
invention is arranged in such a way that it can select an access<br>
link for a communication session from among the different access<br>
links in accordance with a selection procedure and in dependence on<br>
the status information provided by the access path monitor 21. The<br>
7<br><br>
MRRM entity 200 furthermore comprises a modifier 23 arranged for<br>
modifying one or both of the monitoring procedure of the access path<br>
monitor 21 and the selection procedure of the controller 22 in<br>
accordance with a modification procedure and in dependence on<br>
decision information. Fig. 1 furthermore shows an entity 29, which<br>
schematically summarizes all further entities of the communication<br>
system 10 for sending or receiving data. For example, if the<br>
communication system 10 is a mobile terminal, such as a mobile<br>
telephone device, the entity 29 will comprise well known functions<br>
provided above the link layer, such as telephone applications,<br>
multi-media applications, etc.<br>
As has already been mentioned above, the communication system 10 can<br>
be a unit or a system of distributed entities. Equally, the access<br>
path monitor 21, the access controller 22 and the modifier 23 can be<br>
provided in a single unit, e.g. in a single programmable processor,<br>
or can be individual entities that are distributed over different<br>
locations. According to a preferred embodiment, the communication<br>
system 10 is a unit, such as a mobile terminal capable of multiple<br>
radio access using at least two different radio access technologies,<br>
and the monitor 21, controller 22 and modifier 23 are all provided<br>
as functions within a programmable processor.<br>
Expressed as a method, the present invention can be embodied as<br>
shown in Fig. 3, where the flowchart shows a monitoring procedure<br>
S31 as executed by access path monitor 21, followed by a selection<br>
procedure S32 as executed by access controller 22, followed by a<br>
modification procedure S33 as executed by modifier 23. Naturally,<br>
Fig. 3 is only an example, and the three procedures can also be<br>
provided in parallel.<br>
As can be seen from the above, the present invention can be embodied<br>
as hardware, software or any suitable combination of hardware and<br>
software.<br>
In Fig. 1, communication system 10 can be regarded as an Ambient<br>
Network. Fig. 1 shows a second Ambient Network 80, which comprises<br>
8<br><br>
communication entities 31-34 and 41-43 for establishing links with<br>
communication system 10. For example, entity 31 can be associated<br>
with the WINNER access technology, entity 32 with WLAN access<br>
technology, entity 33 with WCDMA access technology and entity 34<br>
with WiMAX technology. Equally, communication entity 41 can be<br>
associated with WCDMA access technology, entity 42 with WiMAX access<br>
technology and entity 43 with WINNER access technology. The<br>
communication entities 31-34 are associated with a GLL entity 35 and<br>
the communication entities 41-43 are associated with a GLL entity<br>
44. In the example of Fig. 1, the two GLL entities 35 and 44 are<br>
associated with a common MRRM entity 50. The ambient network 80<br>
furthermore comprises a connection or gateway entity 60 to a<br>
communication network (not shown), such as telephone network, an<br>
intranet or the Internet.<br>
As an example, the communication entities 31-34 can be associated<br>
with one wireless base station and the communication entities 41-43<br>
with another wireless base station. Similar to the description of<br>
communication system 10, the ambient network 80 may also be a unit<br>
or may be spread out over several locations. Therefore, the just<br>
described entities 31-35, 41-44, 50 and 60 may be located together<br>
or spread out over several locations and individual networks. It is<br>
therefore noted that the representation in Fig. 1 is schematic and<br>
oriented along the logical arrangement of entities within a<br>
hierarchy of communication layers.<br>
In the example of Fig. 1 link 201 is a WLAN link, links 202 and 204<br>
are WCDMA links, links 203 and 205 are WiMAX links and link 205 is a<br>
WINNER link. As an example, the access path monitor 21 can obtain<br>
status information related to the status of WLAN link 201 and the<br>
status of WCDMA links 202 and 204. In this case WLAN link 201 can be<br>
seen as an example of a group of first access paths and WCDMA links<br>
202, 204 as a group of second access paths of a different access<br>
technology than the first group.<br>
In the example of Fig. 1, the monitor 21, the access controller 22<br>
and the modifier 23 are shown as parts of system 10. However, it<br>
9<br><br>
should be noted that one, two or all of entities 21, 22 and 23 can<br>
also be provided in the ambient network 80. In this case the<br>
entities 10 and 80 together form a communication system that<br>
embodies the present invention. For example, the monitor 21 and<br>
modifier 23 can be provided in MRRM entity 50 or in one of GLL<br>
entities 35 and 44. Equally, the entities 21, 22, and 23 can be<br>
spread out over the entities 10 and 80. For example, the monitor 21<br>
could have a part in MRRM entity 200 and a part in MRRM entity 50,<br>
and/or parts in the GLL entities 24, 35 and 44. The same applies to<br>
the access controller 22 and the modifier 23, i.e. these entities<br>
could be spread out in the same way.<br>
The obtaining of information can be done in any suitable or<br>
desirable way, e.g. by performing measurements at communication<br>
system 10 with respect to desired parameters, such as the signal<br>
quality on a link (measured in any suitable or desirable way, e.g.<br>
as a bit error rate, a signal strength value, an interference level<br>
etc.), a load value (measured in any suitable or desirable way, e.g.<br>
as a number of different terminal devices sharing a given link, as a<br>
utilization ratio, etc.) etc. On the other hand, the information may<br>
also be obtained in other ways e.g. received from the ambient<br>
network 80, which may perform measurements and convey the measured<br>
information or which may receive such information from the overlying<br>
communication network.<br>
The status information can be expressed in any suitable or desirable<br>
way, e.g. it can be qualitative information such as a message<br>
indicating "link not available" or it can be quantitative<br>
information such as the numerical value of a given parameter.<br>
The selection procedure for selecting an access path for a<br>
communication session from among first and second access paths can<br>
be chosen in any suitable or desirable way. The present invention is<br>
not limited to any particular selection procedure, as the selection<br>
procedure can be chosen in dependence on a large number of<br>
preferences and strategies. For example, the selection procedure can<br>
consist in selecting the link with the highest quality, or it can<br>
10<br><br>
consist in choosing the link with the lowest load, or it can consist<br>
in choosing the link consuming the least amount of energy, etc. It<br>
is noted that in the present invention, the selecting of an access<br>
path can consist in selecting one access path for carrying a<br>
communication session, or can consist in selecting a plurality of<br>
access paths for carrying one communication session. As an example,<br>
in Fig. 1 a session may be carried over any one of links 201-206, or<br>
over more than one of said links simultaneously, e.g. a part of a<br>
session may be carried over WLAN link 201 and another part over<br>
WCDMA link 204.<br>
The selection procedure can comprise the initial selection of an<br>
access path for a new session, and preferably also comprises the<br>
possibility of switching an established communication session<br>
between access paths of different access technologies while the<br>
communication session is active.<br>
For example, in Fig. 1 the access controller 22 can be arranged to<br>
perform a selection procedure such that an active session can be<br>
switched from e.g. WCDMA link 204 to WLAN link 201 based on obtained<br>
status information, e.g. when the signal quality on link 204 falls<br>
below a threshold, when the load on link 201 falls below a<br>
predetermined threshold or when the link quality on link 201 exceeds<br>
that on link 204 and link 201 is available.<br>
The modification procedure can be chosen in any suitable or<br>
desirable way in view of a desired strategy and a desired objective.<br>
The decision information used by the modifier 23 in the modification<br>
procedure will equally depend on the desired strategy or objective.<br>
This will become readily understandable from the examples in the<br>
following description.<br>
In a general sense, the modifying of a procedure (one or both of the<br>
selection procedure and the monitoring procedure) can comprise<br>
changing parameters used by the procedure (such as e.g. changing the<br>
frequency with which the monitoring procedure obtains status<br>
information, changing the frequency with which the access path<br>
11<br><br>
monitor forwards obtain status information to the access controller,<br>
or changing the frequency with which the selection procedure takes a<br>
selection decision) or the modifying can also consist in adapting<br>
the process of the procedure itself. The latter can e.g. be done by<br>
having a procedure which comprises a plurality of subroutines or<br>
modes, and letting the modification procedure choose a subroutine or<br>
mode. As an example of the latter, a monitoring procedure can be<br>
envisioned in which in a first mode a large number of access paths<br>
is measured at a high frequency, such that this mode is energy<br>
intensive, and in a second mode less access paths are measured at a<br>
lower frequency, i.e. the second mode is less energy intensive.<br>
Then, depending on associated decision information, such as the<br>
energy status of the communication system (e.g. the battery status),<br>
an appropriate monitoring mode can be chosen. In other words, if the<br>
energy status of the communication system is low (i.e. below a<br>
predetermined threshold), then the mode that consumes less energy is<br>
chosen, whereas if the energy status of the communication system is<br>
high (i.e. above a predetermined threshold), the mode with greater<br>
energy consumption is chosen.<br>
As already mentioned, the modifying of the monitoring procedure<br>
and/or selection procedure may comprise modifying the frequency with<br>
which status information is obtained and/or modifying the frequency<br>
with which the status information is forwarded from the access path<br>
monitor to the access controller and/or modifying the frequency at<br>
which the selection procedure takes a selection decision. The<br>
frequency of obtaining status information, e.g. the frequency of<br>
performing measurements on the access paths under observation, and<br>
the frequency with which status information is forwarded, is a<br>
measure of the amount of energy, processing power and signalling<br>
overhead invested in the monitoring and selecting operation. As a<br>
consequence, if it is desired to reduce this invested effort under<br>
certain situations, then the decision information is chosen to be<br>
able to judge the presence or absence of the certain situation (e.g.<br>
the certain situation can be a low power status of the communication<br>
system or a high processor load, and the decision information is<br>
then appropriately chosen, e.g. the power status of the<br>
12<br><br>
communication system or the processor status), and if the certain<br>
situation is present, then one or both of the above-mentioned<br>
frequencies can be reduced. On the other hand, if the monitoring or<br>
selection procedure are adjusted to expend little effort, the<br>
determination that the above-mentioned certain situation is no<br>
longer present can be used as a basis for modifying one or both of<br>
the monitoring procedure and selection procedure by increasing one<br>
or both of the above-mentioned frequencies.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, modifying the monitoring procedure<br>
may also comprise modifying the status information being obtained<br>
for one or more of the access paths. For example, this can mean<br>
changing the type of information, such as going from one type of<br>
information to another, or adding a new type of information in<br>
addition to the old type. For example, if the access path monitor 21<br>
in Fig. 1 is obtaining signal quality information for link 201, a<br>
modification of the monitoring procedure can consist in switching to<br>
monitoring load information, or can consist in additionally<br>
monitoring load information.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, modifying the monitoring procedure<br>
may comprise modifying the number of access paths for which status<br>
information is obtained. As an example, if it is desirable to reduce<br>
the effort expended on monitoring access paths, then the number of<br>
access paths being observed can be reduced. The modification<br>
procedure may furthermore be arranged such that the selecting<br>
procedure is modified by modifying the number of access paths from<br>
among which an access path for a communication session is selected.<br>
In other words, the selecting procedure may be such that a selection<br>
is not performed for all available access paths but only from a<br>
limited set. For example, in Fig. 1 the selection procedure<br>
performed by access controller 22 could be such that only links 201,<br>
202 and 204 are considered for selection, although further links are<br>
available. In accordance with the present embodiment, the<br>
modification procedure can comprise increasing or reducing the<br>
access paths considered for selection. In keeping with the just<br>
mentioned example, the selection procedure could be modified by<br>
13<br><br>
removing link 202 from the set of links considered for selection,<br>
such that a selection is only performed between link 201 and link<br>
204, if it is desired to reduce the amount of effort expended on the<br>
selection operation. It is noted that the modification of the<br>
selection operation can go so far as to reduce the set of access<br>
paths under consideration to one, thereby effectively disabling the<br>
selection operation. Equally, modifying the number of access paths<br>
being monitored by the monitoring procedure can also reduce this<br>
number to one or zero, thereby effectively disabling the monitoring<br>
procedure.<br>
The modifying of the monitoring procedure or selection procedure by<br>
modifying the corresponding number of access paths under<br>
consideration will now also be explained with respect to an example<br>
known from the above-mentioned document IST-2002-507134-AN/WP2/D02<br>
on Ambient Networks. In connection with Ambient Networks and a<br>
plurality of radio access links it is known to define a plurality of<br>
sets:<br>
a Detected Set (DS), which is the set of all access links that<br>
are available and to which an ambient network could potentially<br>
connect. Some of the access links may actually not have been<br>
detected by measurements but can be known due to context<br>
information, i.e. it can be known from a MRRM entity that at a<br>
certain position a certain radio access is available (such as a WLAN<br>
hotspot at e.g. an airport). Such radio accesses can be announced by<br>
means of radio access advertisement messages.<br>
a Candidate Set (CS) , which is a subset of the detected set,<br>
and can be used by an ambient network to connect to one or more<br>
other networks. The detected set can contain radio accesses, which<br>
are not part of the candidate set. These radio accesses can e.g. be<br>
rejected for a given Ambient Network due to policy reasons or due to<br>
technical limitations of the access network to use a certain radio<br>
access.<br>
14<br><br>
MRRM Active Set (AS), which is a subset of the candidate set.<br>
The MRRM active set contains all radio accesses which are actively<br>
managed for a certain communication session. There can be different<br>
MRRM active sets for different sessions. The MRRM active set<br>
contains only elements out of the candidate set which also fulfil<br>
predetermined minimum requirements, e.g. in radio link quality or<br>
with respect to system load, and also fulfil service specific<br>
requirements for the communication session. The latter can be a<br>
quality of service requirement (such as data rate, delay, jitter,<br>
etc) , but can also be security requirements (such as encrypted<br>
transmission, authenticated transmission, etc).<br>
GLL active set, which is a subset of MRRM active set. The GLL<br>
active set contains a number of radio accesses that may be<br>
dynamically assigned to a communication session by one or more GLL<br>
entities.<br>
In the example of Fig. 1, the detected set could e.g. be all of<br>
links 201-207, where link 207 is indicated as a link not being used<br>
by communication system 10 but available. The candidate set could<br>
e.g. be links 202-206 while the MRRM active set could e.g. be links<br>
203-206. Finally, the GLL active set could e.g. be links 204-206,<br>
which are all associated with the GLL entity 44.<br>
In a communication system using the above-mentioned sets of access<br>
links or access paths, the modification procedure can comprise<br>
changing the links or paths in one or more of any of the above-<br>
mentioned sets. For example, the modification of the monitoring<br>
procedure may comprise changing the number of links or paths in the<br>
MRRM candidate set, and the modifying of the selecting procedure may<br>
comprise changing the number of links or paths in the GLL active<br>
set.<br>
As already mentioned previously, the decision information used by<br>
the modifier for modifying one or both of the monitoring procedure<br>
and the selection procedure can be chosen in any suitable or<br>
desirable way, depending on the desired objective and strategy.<br>
15<br><br>
According to one example, the decision information can at least<br>
partially be derived from the status information that is being<br>
obtained by the monitoring procedure. As an example, the status<br>
information can comprise measurements of the signal quality on the<br>
access path currently being used for carrying the communication<br>
session, and measurements of signal quality on further accessible<br>
links. This signal quality information can be used as decision<br>
information by the modification procedure in the following way. If<br>
the signal quality on the currently used access path exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold, then the monitoring procedure and selection<br>
can be disabled, whereas if the signal quality is below the<br>
threshold, then the monitoring procedure and selection procedure are<br>
activated.<br>
The decision information can be identical to the status information,<br>
or the status information can be processed for deriving the decision<br>
information. For example, if the status information is a parameter,<br>
then the temporal change rate (time differential) of said parameter<br>
can also be used as decision information.<br>
As with the status information, the decision information can also be<br>
of any desirable type i.e. it can be qualitative, such as a message<br>
indicating "link not available", or it can be qualitative, like a<br>
numerical value. According to a preferred embodiment, the decision<br>
information comprises numerical values. More preferably, the<br>
numerical values comprise values of one or more decision parameters.<br>
Examples of such decision parameters can be the previously mentioned<br>
status parameters, such as signal quality or load on an access path.<br>
The modification procedure can then comprise comparing parameter<br>
values associated with one of the decision parameters with a<br>
respective threshold. For example, if the signal quality value on<br>
the currently used access path is above a predetermined quality<br>
threshold and/or the load on the currently used access path is below<br>
a predetermined load threshold, then the modification procedure can<br>
appropriately modify the monitoring procedure and/or selection<br>
procedure, e.g. by reducing the frequency of obtaining information<br>
16<br><br>
on monitored access paths (up to disabling the monitoring procedure)<br>
and by reducing the number of access paths considered for selection<br>
(up to disabling the selection procedure).<br>
Another example of numerical values comprised in the decision<br>
information are change rate values of one or more of the mentioned<br>
decision parameters. These change rate values derived from a given<br>
decision parameter can be compared with a respective threshold as a<br>
part of the modification procedure. For example, if the time<br>
differential of the signal quality on the currently used access path<br>
is below a quality change rate threshold, and/or the time<br>
differential of the load on the currently used access path is below<br>
a predetermined load change rate threshold, then the modification<br>
may comprise reducing the effort expended on performing the<br>
monitoring procedure and/or selection procedure, e.g. by reducing<br>
the rate of obtaining status information for the access paths of the<br>
different access technologies.<br>
As can be seen from the above examples, the decision information may<br>
comprise a traffic load indication. This indication can be a<br>
quantitative or qualitative information, and it can be indicative of<br>
the traffic load on an individual path or the traffic load in a<br>
larger context, e.g. the traffic load in an entire Ambient Network<br>
under consideration. The decision information can also comprise<br>
information derived from the traffic load indication, such as the<br>
time differential of traffic load values.<br>
The decision information can also comprise a signal quality<br>
indication, which can be a qualitative or quantitative information.<br>
The signal quality indication can be indicative of the signal<br>
quality on the one or more currently used access paths for a<br>
communication session, or of the signal quality on access paths<br>
being monitored. The decision information can also comprise<br>
information derived from the signal quality indication, such as the<br>
time derivative of signal quality values. As an example, if it is<br>
determined that the change rate of signal quality on access paths<br>
being monitored falls below a predetermined threshold, then the<br>
17<br><br>
modification procedure can reduce the frequency with which status<br>
information is obtained, as a high frequency is not necessary.<br>
Additionally, or alternatively, in the event that the communication<br>
system is mobile, the decision information may comprise an<br>
indication of the velocity of the communication system. If the<br>
communication systems velocity falls below a predetermined<br>
threshold, then the modification procedure can adjust the monitoring<br>
procedure and/or selection procedure in such a way as to reduce the<br>
effort expended on monitoring and selecting access paths. Namely, if<br>
the communication system is only moving very slowly or not moving at<br>
all, then there is less expected benefit in the monitoring and<br>
selection procedures, such that it can be desirable to reduce the<br>
expended effort.<br>
Alternatively or additionally the modification procedure can be such<br>
that the decision information comprises an indication of resources<br>
available to the communication device. Such resources can e.g. be<br>
power resources (such as the battery power level) or processing<br>
resources (such as the degree to which a processor is being<br>
utilized). As indicated previously, in the event that the available<br>
resources are low (e.g. low power or little free processing<br>
capacity), the modification procedure may modify the monitoring<br>
procedure and/or selection procedure in such a way as to reduce the<br>
expended effort, e.g. by reducing the frequency with which status<br>
information is obtained.<br>
As already mentioned in the summary of invention, the choice of the<br>
modification procedure and the associated decision information can<br>
be done in view of an implicit analysis of costs and/or benefits or<br>
a balancing of implicit costs and benefits. However, the decision<br>
information may also comprise the use of explicit cost and/or<br>
benefit values. Namely, the decision information may comprise one or<br>
both of estimated benefit values and estimated cost values for a<br>
plurality of different settings of the monitoring procedure.<br>
Equally, the decision information may comprise one or both of<br>
estimated benefit values and estimated cost values for a plurality<br>
18<br><br>
of different settings of the selection procedure. An example of a<br>
cost function for monitoring a plurality of access paths is:<br><br>
where CMon^tor is the monitoring cost, fMonitor i is tne frequency<br>
of monitoring access path i and cMonitor i 1S the cost for<br>
monitoring access path i. The sum runs over all access paths i being<br>
monitored. The cost cMonitor j_ can be expressed in any suitable or<br>
desirable way, i.e. can be a dimensionless variable or can be<br>
expressed in terms of a parameter, such as in terms of consume<br>
energy. Similarly to equation (1) , the costs for signalling the<br>
status information for the access path monitor to the access<br>
controller can be expressed as:<br><br>
where fForward i ^s the frequency of forwarding status information<br>
for access path i and Cporwarcj i is the cost of forwarding status<br>
information for access path i.<br>
Similar functions can be formulated for the costs of performing the<br>
selection operation, or for the benefits of performing the<br>
monitoring procedure and/or the selection procedure.<br>
As an example, the modification procedure can be such that the<br>
monitoring cost is calculated in accordance with equation (1), and<br>
if the total cost CM0n-L^-or exceeds a predetermined threshold, then<br>
the monitoring frequencies fMonitor i are changed to make Cf/jQ^tor<br>
again fall below the threshold.<br>
It is noted that costs and/or benefits can be determined in<br>
accordance with mathematical functions as given in above examples<br>
19<br><br>
(1) and (2), but can also e.g. be determined on the basis of multi-<br>
dimensional tables or mappings where a cost value and/or a benefit<br>
value is assigned to a vector of input parameter values, such as a<br>
vector of the frequency value of monitoring, the number of access<br>
paths being monitored, etc.<br>
As a further alternative or addition, the decision information used<br>
by the modifier may comprise preference information set by one or<br>
both of a user of the communication system and an operator of the<br>
network. For example, the user of the communication system may have<br>
a preference for a certain access technology, and the modifier can<br>
be arranged to modify the monitoring procedure in such a way that<br>
access paths of said preferred access technology are always<br>
monitored if available.<br>
As a further alternative or addition, the modifier can be arranged<br>
such that the decision information comprises an indication of the<br>
momentary sensitivity of the selecting procedure to a timeliness of<br>
the status information. When monitoring access paths and performing<br>
a selection procedure there is the problem that a delay occurs<br>
between the gathering of the status information and the use of said<br>
status information in the selection procedure. This delay is caused<br>
by the time required for obtaining the status information, and the<br>
time necessary for forwarding the status information from the access<br>
path monitor to the access controller. Furthermore, the delay<br>
depends on the frequency with which status information is obtained<br>
and the frequency at which the status information is forwarded from<br>
the access monitor to the access controller. Namely, if status<br>
information for a given access path being monitored only arrives<br>
every At at the access controller, then at the end of the period At<br>
the momentary status may have already changed considerably. The<br>
momentary sensitivity of the selecting procedure can therefore be an<br>
important parameter in modifying one or both of the monitoring<br>
procedure and the selection procedure. For example, if it is<br>
determined that the momentary sensitivity is above a predetermined<br>
threshold, then the modification procedure can modify the monitoring<br>
procedure by increasing the frequency of obtaining status<br>
20<br><br>
information, and vice versa if the momentary sensitivity is below a<br>
predetermined threshold, then the modification procedure can reduce<br>
the frequency at which status information is obtained. The<br>
sensitivity can be e.g. be indicated in terms of the differential of<br>
a mathematical selection function with respect to the input status<br>
parameter values.<br>
As a further alternative or addition, the modifier can be arranged<br>
such that said modification procedure comprises a determination of<br>
whether one or more service requirements are fulfilled for the<br>
communication session. The service requirement can be chosen in any<br>
suitable or desirable way, e.g. it can be a data rate value or some<br>
other quality of service measure. The criterion for fulfilment is<br>
set by defining an associated threshold accordingly. As an example,<br>
if the communication session of a user of the communication system<br>
is a voice communication, a data rate threshold of e.g. 50 kbit/s<br>
can be considered sufficient, such that if the momentary access path<br>
or paths provide this data rate, even if a new access path is<br>
available that has a higher data rate, there is no benefit in<br>
switching to it. As a consequence, the modifier can modify the<br>
monitoring procedure and/or the selecting procedure in such a way<br>
that the effort expended is reduced if the service requirement is<br>
fulfilled, e.g. by disabling the monitoring procedure and the<br>
selecting procedure if the threshold data rate is exceeded by the<br>
momentary access path(s).<br>
The present invention is generally concerned with making the<br>
monitoring procedure and/or the selection procedure of a<br>
communication system that can access a network via access path of<br>
different access technology dynamically adaptable or modifiable, in<br>
order to be able to dynamically adjust the trade-off between an<br>
effort expended for performing the monitoring and selecting with<br>
respect to the benefit derived therefrom. Generally, the balance<br>
between cost and benefit is such that when the expected benefit<br>
decreases, the expended effort for monitoring and selecting can be<br>
decreased and vice versa. For example, if the monitoring procedure<br>
is operated to less frequently obtain status information (e.g. by<br>
21<br><br>
less frequently performing measurements), this reduces the amount of<br>
signalling overhead and reduces energy consumption. At the same<br>
time, the selection procedure must make decisions based on less<br>
timely status information, which can reduce the benefit of<br>
performing the selection procedure.<br>
As already indicated in some of the examples above, the access path<br>
monitoring (monitoring procedure) and access controller (selection<br>
procedure) can be modified in view of one or more of the following<br>
input parameters:<br>
traffic load and experienced rate of change in traffic load.<br>
If the traffic load is below a predetermined threshold and/or the<br>
rate of change of traffic load is below a threshold, then the<br>
monitoring frequency can be reduced.<br>
access path quality and experienced rate of change in access<br>
path quality. If the access path quality is above a predetermined<br>
threshold and/or the rate of change of access path quality is below<br>
a predetermined threshold, then the monitoring frequency can be<br>
reduced.<br>
a number of users in the environment. If few users are in the<br>
environment, the benefit of multi-user diversity is low. In this<br>
case a diversity gain can be achieved by selecting the access path<br>
based on instantaneous access path quality. If many users are<br>
present, little diversity gain can be achieved. The diversity gain<br>
is a type of benefit. As a consequence, depending on the number of<br>
users in the environment of the communication system, the selection<br>
procedure can be modified, e.g. the number of access paths<br>
considered in the selection procedure is reduced if the number of<br>
users in the environment increases beyond a predetermined threshold,<br>
and the monitoring procedure is accordingly also modified to provide<br>
the appropriate status information.<br>
if multiple access paths are available, they can be classified<br>
into different sets, as explained previously with respect to the<br>
22<br><br>
Detected Set, Candidate Set, MRRM Active Set and GLL Active Set.<br>
Depending on the set to which an access path belongs, the frequency<br>
with which status information is obtained can be adapted.<br>
performance desired by user. An example of a user preference<br>
is an indication of the desired performance, e.g. a desired quality<br>
of service (QoS) or a desired data rate. If the user achieves the<br>
desired performance, then the effort expended on the monitoring<br>
procedure and selection procedure can be reduced.<br>
performance allowed by network. If a user achieves the<br>
performance he is allowed by the network, e.g. in terms of quality<br>
of service or data rate, then the effort expended on the monitoring<br>
procedure or selection procedure can be reduced.<br>
battery power of communication system. If the battery of the<br>
communication system is low, then the frequency for obtaining status<br>
information in the access path monitor can be reduced, the frequency<br>
for forwarding status information to the access controller can be<br>
reduced, and the processing expended for the selection procedure can<br>
be reduced. As an example, both the monitoring procedure and the<br>
selection procedure can be effectively disabled if the battery power<br>
falls below a predetermined threshold value.<br>
system resources. The conducting of a selection procedure<br>
generally improves the efficient use of system resources, both in<br>
the communication system and in the network. However, if enough<br>
system resources are already available (i.e. the value of an<br>
appropriate system resource measure is above a predetermined<br>
threshold), then the effort expended on the monitoring procedure and<br>
the selection procedure can be reduced, e.g. by reducing the<br>
frequency which status information is obtained.<br>
user behaviour. If the communication system is mobile and a<br>
user of the communication system is moving faster than a<br>
predetermined velocity threshold, the status parameters may vary<br>
rapidly. As a consequence, it can be desirable in this case to<br>
23<br><br>
increase the frequency at which status information is obtained, in<br>
order to have timely status information.<br>
The strategies and desired objectives when modifying the frequency<br>
at which status information is obtained and the frequency at which<br>
status information is forwarded can be manifold. In this connection,<br>
one can for example consider a service criterion, a resource<br>
criterion or an MRRM performance criterion. The service criterion<br>
defines to what extent the requirements of the service and/or the<br>
user are met. An example of a service criterion is: is the minimum<br>
quality of service threshold achieved? Another example is: is a<br>
higher quality of service level required or desired? For example, is<br>
an access path having higher resolution or higher rate available for<br>
streaming? Or as another example, is the additional cost (e.g. in<br>
monetary terms) worth the increase in service performance?<br>
A resource criterion defines to what extent transmission resources<br>
are critical. Examples are: are system resources highly utilized<br>
(e.g. high load) and how many resources remain available? Is the<br>
battery power low?<br>
The MRRM performance criterion relates to what the estimated benefit<br>
or gain of Multi-Radio Resource Management is. In several studies a<br>
number of MRRM algorithms have been studied to select a radio link<br>
for a user connection. Input parameters can be link quality, service<br>
requirements, system load, etc. It has been shown that these<br>
algorithms can provide everything from substantial gains in<br>
performance to only very small gains. The gain or benefit depends on<br>
many aspects: what radio access technologies are used, what<br>
deployment patterns are used, how the traffic demand is distributed<br>
with respect to the areas of service (e.g. radio cells), what are<br>
the service requirements, what input parameters are used for the<br>
selection procedure and which selection algorithms are used, how<br>
many users are in the system (e.g. due to variations of link<br>
quality, a selection procedure can provide a multi-access diversity<br>
gain. For a large number of users there is a multi-user diversity<br>
gain, which exploits channel variations. If a large multi-user<br>
24<br><br>
diversity gain is achieved, little additional gain remains for<br>
access selection diversity), what costs (in terms of any desired<br>
measure) are involved for performing the monitoring procedure and to<br>
what extent does this use up the achieved or achievable<br>
benefit/gain, what is the position of the MRRM input parameter(s).<br>
In this respect, the precision of estimation, the delay of<br>
distributing measurements and the degree of variability in the<br>
system (variation of load and link quality, e.g. caused by the users<br>
mobility) play a role.<br>
As explained in connection with Ambient Networks, a number of sets<br>
can be defined on which different MRRM functions are performed. Most<br>
of these functions require a monitoring procedure for obtaining<br>
status information. Within the detected set and candidate set,<br>
monitoring provides occasional information about information<br>
elements like link quality, load etc. Based on this monitoring<br>
input, an access path can be moved to the MRRM/GLL active set.<br>
Within the active set, MRRM performs selection and allocation of<br>
access paths to user sessions. In order to achieve this, it is<br>
desirable to have a more precise monitoring procedure, e.g. status<br>
information is obtained more frequently and/or more different types<br>
of status information are obtained. The following examples are<br>
further embodiments of the invention in this context:<br>
Based on the service criterion, resource criterion and/or MRRM<br>
performance criterion, it can be decided to what extent a selection<br>
procedure in MRRM is feasible. If there is no problem, or little<br>
benefit expected, then the expended effort can be kept low. For<br>
example, the size of the active set and candidate set can be held to<br>
a predetermined small number. If the active set size is limited to<br>
one, no selection procedure is effectively performed. Also, the<br>
number of alternative access paths in the candidate set can be<br>
limited in a similar way.<br>
If a selection procedure is performed across a number of<br>
access paths (e.g. the active set contains several elements), the<br>
appropriate access selection algorithm can be chosen depending on<br>
25<br><br>
system parameters like access path quality, service, load, or<br>
combinations thereof. The access selection frequency can be adapted<br>
according to the sensitivity of input parameters of the access<br>
selection function and the dynamic variations of system parameters.<br>
For example, the gain or benefit of MRRM decreases if outdated input<br>
parameters (e.g. measured load or link quality values) are used. At<br>
the same time, the consumed resources for the monitoring procedure<br>
decrease. If the variability of the system increases, then it is<br>
desirable to also increase the frequency at which status information<br>
is obtained and/or at which access paths are selected.<br>
It may be noted that many of the above examples referred to the<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 1. Although Fig. 1 constitutes a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the present invention is by no means<br>
restricted thereto. For example, the present invention is not<br>
restricted to being applied in a communication system that accesses<br>
a network via a group of first radio access links of a first<br>
technology and a group of second radio access links of a second<br>
access technology different from the first access technology.<br>
Namely, the invention also applies to the more general case of<br>
access paths that may be multi-hop relay links. Furthermore, the<br>
access paths do not have to be radio access paths, as the invention<br>
equally applies to the case of wire-bound access paths of differing<br>
access technology.<br>
As the present invention is not restricted to the field of wireless<br>
communication, it can also be applied in the area of media routing.<br>
Overlay networks can be used to transmit data to a receiver via<br>
different networks. A Media Port makes a routing decision of<br>
selecting the right network. For this, the Media Port obtains<br>
monitoring information about the status (e.g. load) and capabilities<br>
of the different networks. This can also be considered as a<br>
monitoring procedure within the meaning of the present invention.<br>
The monitoring procedure in this case evaluates a complete sub-<br>
network. It can consist of measurement procedures (link ping packet<br>
trains), end-user quality of service reports or feedback information<br>
of sub-network-specific management functions.<br>
26<br><br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to<br>
preferred embodiments, these only serve to illustrate the invention,<br>
but are by no means restrictive. The invention is defined by the<br>
appended claims. Reference signs serve to make the claims easier to<br>
read but do not have any limiting effect.<br>
