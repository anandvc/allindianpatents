				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an ophthalmic lens<br>
including electro-optical means.<br>
Numerous attempts have been made to adapt certain<br>
optical characteristics of ophthalmic lenses, or<br>
spectacles eyeglasses, dynamically in order to improve<br>
comfort or in order to provide new functions for wearers<br>
of the lenses. By way of example, the light transmission<br>
of lenses can be reduced under conditions of high<br>
brightness, and can be increased again when ambient light<br>
returns to a normal or low level of intensity.<br>
Photochromic lenses perform this function, but the<br>
variations in light transmission provided by such lenses<br>
are determined by the intensity of ultraviolet radiation<br>
illuminating the lenses. The light transmission level<br>
adopted by photochromic lenses is therefore unsuitable<br>
under certain circumstances. In particular, photochromic<br>
lenses inside a car remain in a state of high<br>
transparency whenever the level of sunlight. A car driver<br>
is therefore not protected against being dazzled when<br>
wearing spectacles with photochromic lenses.<br>
Electro-optical systems enable an optical<br>
characteristic to be controlled by means oi an electrical<br>
stimulus. By way of example, the light transmission of an<br>
electrochromic lens varies in response to an electric<br>
current.<br>
Electro-optical systems thus require an electrical<br>
power supply in order to deliver the electrical stimulus.<br>
Small-sized batteries have been integrated with<br>
spectacles frames so as to power electro-optical devices<br>
integrated with the lenses. Such batteries have been<br>
placed on the branches or "temples" of the spectacles, or<br>
they have been hidden in the bridge of the frame between<br><br>
the two lenses. Electrical connections then connect the<br>
battery(ies) to the electro-optical system.<br>
Such battery power supplies suffer from the<br>
drawback of significant weight and size. In addition,<br>
they are reserved for lenses that have been specially<br>
produced for a frame of given shape. Unfortunately, in<br>
most cases, lenses are produced independently of frames.<br>
They are then cut, trimmed, and/or drilled so as to be<br>
brought to the dimensions of a frame or a jig, and then<br>
they are assembled to the frame or to the jig. Because of<br>
the wide variety of shapes of frames and jigs, it is<br>
difficult to design electrical connections that include a<br>
portion that is made on the lens prior to the lens being<br>
cut to size. In addition, such connections need to be<br>
connected to the frame after the lenses have been<br>
assembled in the frame. Making such connections is<br>
particularly expensive since it requires finishing steps<br>
to be performed.<br>
An object of the present invention thus consists in<br>
proposing an ophthalmic lens fitted with an electro-<br>
optical system that does not present the above-mentioned<br>
drawbacks.<br>
The invention thus provides an ophthalmic lens<br>
-comprising a transparent substrate and electro-optical<br>
means integrated with the substrate to perform an optical<br>
function in response to an electrical stimulus. The lens<br>
of the invention further comprises at least one<br>
photovoltaic cell integrated with the substrate to power<br>
the electro-optical means in response to incident light,<br>
and, optionally a control circuit for controlling the<br>
electrical voltage produced by the photovoltaic cell,<br>
said control circuit being integrated with the substrate.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, both the electro-<br>
optical system and the electrical power supply are<br>
integrated with the substrate of the lens. The electrical<br><br>
connections between the electro-optical system and the<br>
power supply can thus also be integrated with the lens<br>
substrate, so these connections are separate from the<br>
frame. They can be implemented within the lens before it<br>
is assembled to the frame. The assembly that is performed<br>
subsequently does not need to be modified by the presence<br>
of the electro-optical system. In particular, it can be<br>
performed at low cost.<br>
Furthermore, integrating the electrical connections<br>
in the substrate of the lens makes it possible to use<br>
connections of small dimensions, or indeed miniature<br>
connections. Such connections can be discreet or even<br>
invisible. They are therefore compatible with the<br>
appearance requirements applicable to the field of<br>
spectacles.<br>
Another advantage of a spectacles lens according to<br>
the invention comes from the nature of the electrical<br>
power supply used. Unlike a battery, a photovoltaic cell<br>
does not need to be renewed periodically, since the<br>
energy delivered by such a cell is generated from the<br>
incident light.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
photovoltaic cell is sensitive to visible light. Thus,<br>
the optical function is activated as a function of the<br>
conditions of luminosity to which the eyes of the wearer<br>
of the lenses are sensitive. The optical means are thus<br>
activated in compliance with a visually perceived optical<br>
function.<br>
The photovoltaic cell may be integrated with the<br>
lens substrate in various ways. In a first type of<br>
embodiment, the photovoltaic cell is incorporated in an<br>
opaque component integrated with the substrate and<br>
occupying less than 10% of the area of the lens. This<br>
leads to very little or even no visual impediment, given<br>
the very small size of the opaque component, which makes<br><br>
it possible to maintain the transparency of the lens<br>
intact over that part of the lens surface that is used<br>
for vision purposes.<br>
In a second type of embodiment, the photovoltaic<br>
cell is partially transparent and presents a light-<br>
collecting surface that covers at least part of the<br>
surface of the lens. Under such circumstances, the light-<br>
collecting surface can be large, thereby enabling an<br>
increased electrical stimulus to be obtained. In<br>
addition, embodiments of this type do not necessarily use<br>
an opaque component, which means that lens configurations<br>
can be obtained that are particularly attractive in<br>
appearance.<br>
The control circuit is also advantageously<br>
integrated with the lens substrate. It can enable the<br>
electrical stimulus delivered to the electro-optical<br>
means to be adapted relative to an amplitude desired for<br>
the optical function. It also makes it possible to adapt<br>
the electrical stimulus relative to intrinsic operating<br>
characteristics of the electro-optical means. In<br>
particular, the control circuit may include a step-up<br>
circuit for raising the electrical voltage produced by<br>
the photovoltaic cell, in particular for the purpose of<br>
reaching an activation threshold for the optical<br>
function.<br>
Optionally, the control circuit may be partially<br>
transparent. Under such circumstances, it may be located<br>
at least in part in a portion of the lens that is used<br>
for vision purposes. The term "a portion of the lens that<br>
is used for vision purposes" is used to mean a portion of<br>
the lens that is located between the eye and an object<br>
being looked at in the field of view. Then there is no<br>
appearance impediment as a result of the presence of the<br>
control circuit within the lens.<br><br>
Optionally, the use of a control circuit can be<br>
avoided by connecting several photovoltaic elements in<br>
series so as to obtain an appropriate power supply<br>
voltage.<br>
The invention also provides a vision device, in<br>
particular a pair of spectacles, including at least one<br>
ophthalmic lens as described above.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will appear from the following description of<br>
two non-limiting embodiments, given with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
• Figure la shows a pair of spectacles in a first<br>
embodiment of the invention ;<br>
Figure lb is a section through a lens in the<br>
embodiment of Figure la ;<br>
Figure 2a shows a spectacles lens in a second<br>
embodiment of the invention ; and<br>
Figure 2b is a section through a lens in the<br>
embodiment of Figure 2a.<br>
In the figures, and for reasons of clarity, the<br>
dimensions of the various elements shown are not<br>
proportional to their real dimensions. Furthermore, throughout the figures, identical references correspond<br>
to elements that are identical or that have identical<br>
functions.<br>
The optical function of the lens may be of various<br>
types. It may be a function of reinforcing contrast by<br>
adapting the tint of the lens, e.g. as described in US<br>
patent No. 6 250 759. It may be also be a function of<br>
reinforcing contrast by filtering light with a determined<br>
direction of polarization.<br>
In the embodiments described below by way of<br>
example, the optical function of the lens is a function<br>
of providing protection against the sun, or protection<br><br>
against being dazzled. This function is activated<br>
electrically. In an initial state, each lens in a pair of<br>
spectacles presents high light transmission in the<br>
visible spectrum. In response to an electrical stimulus,<br>
the lens becomes darker : its light transmission is<br>
reduced in the visible spectrum.<br>
To do this, the electro-optical means comprise a<br>
system having a variable light transmission. Such system<br>
may be of the electrochromic type, for example. In a<br>
preferred manner, it is a system with little electricity<br>
consumption, such as a system based on liquid crystals or<br>
a system of electrophoretic type. For such systems, the<br>
electrical stimulus that leads to a variation in light<br>
transmission is an electric field, i.e. it corresponds to<br>
an electrical voltage being applied across two input<br>
terminals of the system. Electricity consumption is low,<br>
and is compatible with an electrical power supply of<br>
small dimensions.<br>
In a first embodiment, shown in Figures la and lb,<br>
the photovoltaic cell is semiconductor-based. Such a<br>
photovoltaic cell can be made using any known technology,<br>
e.g. by using one of the following alloys : cadmium<br>
telluride (CdTe), gallium arsenide (GaAs), or a<br>
chalcopyrite containing copper such as copper and indium<br>
disclenide (CIS) . Advantageously, the photovoltaic cell<br>
is based on single crystal silicon, or is based on<br>
microcrystalline or amorphous silicon.<br>
Its cost is then low, and it does not contain any<br>
material presenting a risk of toxicity in the event of<br>
the lens being broken or damaged. Photovoltaic cells<br>
implemented using the above-listed technologies all<br>
present a spectral response that includes at least a<br>
portion of the spectrum that is visible to the human eye.<br>
As shown in Figure la, a pair of spectacles is<br>
constituted by a frame 1 having two temples 2, and two<br><br>
ophthalmic lenses 3 assembled in the frame 1. The term<br>
"ophthalmic lens" is used to mean any lens comprising a<br>
transparent substrate of inorganic and/or organic<br>
material, of composition and of shape that can be varied<br>
to fit a spectacles frame so as to protect and/or correct<br>
eyesight. The lenses may be afocal, unifocal, bifocal,<br>
trifocal, or progressive. In particular, an ophthalmic<br>
lens may present a structure comprising multiple layers<br>
and/or a laminated structure. Fabrication may then<br>
include operations of depositing layers on the substrate,<br>
e.g. by evaporating determined materials. Fabrication may<br>
also include operations of assembling a plurality of<br>
substrates together, i.e. " substrate units", in order to<br>
form the final substrate of each lens 3. Substrate units<br>
are assembled to one another by lamination or by<br>
adhesive, for example.<br>
Each lens 3 incorporates a variable transmission<br>
system 5, e.g. a liquid crystal system. Such a liquid<br>
crystal system may be of the type having a holding<br>
voltage or it may be of the bistable type. A holding<br>
voltage system is controlled by an electrical voltage of<br>
about 3 volts, whereas a bistable system requires an<br>
electrical voltage pulse of 15 volts in order to cause<br>
optical switching to occur. The system 5 may be disposed over a fraction of the surface of the lens 3 that is used<br>
for vision purposes. It may also be disposed over the<br>
entire area of the lens.<br>
Each lens 3 also incorporates a photovoltaic cell<br>
6, e.g. of the single-crystal silicon type, of<br>
microcrystalline silicon type or of amorphous silicon<br>
type. The photovoltaic cell 6 may be incorporated in an<br>
opaque component 7 integrated with the substrate of the<br>
lens and occupying an area that is significantly smaller<br>
than the area of the lens. Preferably, the opaque<br>
component 7 occupies an area of less than 10% of the area<br>
of the lens. The dimensions of the opaque component 7 may<br><br>
be 2 millimeters (mm) by 3 mm, for example. Such an<br>
opaque component 7 is located in a portion of each lens 3<br>
that is not used for vision purposes, for example in a<br>
bottom side portion of the lens.<br>
An electronic control circuit 8 (Figure lb) may<br>
also be incorporated in each opaque component 7. Each<br>
control circuit 8 may comprise an adapter of the<br>
electrical voltage delivered by the photovoltaic cell 6<br>
with which it is associated in a single component 7. The<br>
connection between the control circuit 8 and the<br>
photovoltaic cell 6 is also incorporated in the component<br>
7. It can be made by using any of the known techniques<br>
for assembling integrated electronic circuits.<br>
As shown in Figure lb, each of the lenses 3 may be<br>
constituted by two transparent substrate units 3a and 3b<br>
assembled together by adhesive in the proximity of their<br>
periphery. The substrate unit 3a is the back substrate<br>
and the substrate unit 3b is the front substrate. Each of<br>
the substrates 3a and 3b presents high light transmission<br>
in the visible spectrum, e.g. 97%.<br>
The liquid crystal system 5 is interposed between<br>
the two substrates 3a and 3b in the form of a film.<br>
Preferably, the surface inside the lens of one of the substrates 3a or 3b presents a housing that is<br>
complementary in shape to the shape of the liquid crystal<br>
system 5. By providing such a housing, the operation of<br>
the liquid crystal system 5 is not disturbed by any<br>
stresses that might otherwise result from assembling the<br>
substrates 3a and 3b together.<br>
The substrate unit 3b presents a housing 10 in its<br>
face that is on the inside of the lens. The housing 10<br>
may be made when molding the substrate 3b, or it may be<br>
made by machining after the substrate 3b has been molded.<br>
The component 7 which incorporates the photovoltaic cell<br>
6 and the control circuit 8 may be bonded adhesively in<br><br>
the housing 10. Two electrical connections 9a and 9b,<br>
secured to the component 7 and coming from the control<br>
circuit 8, each have a shape of contact point. When the<br>
two substrates 3a and 3b are assembled together via their<br>
respective surfaces that are inside the lens, the two<br>
connections 9a and 9b come into contact with the<br>
respective electrical power supply terminals of the<br>
liquid crystal system 5 which are placed so as to face<br>
the connections 9a and 9b during the assembly operation.<br>
Although Figures la and lb show only one<br>
photovoltaic cell arranged within each lens, a plurality<br>
of photovoltaic cells may be distributed over the surface<br>
of each lens. Under such circumstances, appropriate<br>
connections interconnect the photovoltaic cells within a<br>
given lens so as to obtain, in known manner, an<br>
electrical power supply that presents current and voltage<br>
characteristics adapted to the operation features of the<br>
liquid crystal system 5.<br>
A larger number of photovoltaic cells of very small<br>
dimensions can also be integrated with each lens, with<br>
each cell occupying an area of the lens that is less than<br>
100 square-micrometers, for example. Each photovoltaic<br>
cell then constitutes a spot that is individually<br>
invisible, and the lens remains overall transparent because of the gaps between neighbouring photoVoltaic<br>
cells over the surface of the lens.<br>
In a second embodiment as described below, the<br>
photovoltaic cell 6 is partially transparent. It<br>
possesses a light-collecting area that covers at least a<br>
portion of the area of each lens. Thus, as shown in<br>
Figures 2a and 2b, the portion of the area of the lens 3<br>
that is occupied by the photovoltaic cell 6 may be of the<br>
same order as the portion of the area of the lens 3 that<br>
is occupied by the liquid crystal system 5.<br><br>
Preferably, the light fraction absorbed by the<br>
photovoltaic cell 6 at any point thereof is less than 30%<br>
of the light incident on the lens 3 at that point. Thus,<br>
the presence of the photovoltaic cell 6 in a portion of<br>
the surface of the lens 3 that is useful for vision<br>
purposes is nevertheless compatible with the lens 3<br>
presenting high light transmission so long as its solar<br>
protection function is not activated.<br>
The photovoltaic cell 6 may be of the photo-<br>
electrochemical type. It then comprises two transparent<br>
planar electrodes 6a and 6b (Figure 2b) arranged so as to<br>
face each other parallel to the surface of the lens 3.<br>
The final substrate of the lens 3 is then made up of<br>
three substrate units 3a, 3b, and 3c that are assembled<br>
together in such a manner that the substrate unit 3c is<br>
located between the substrate units 3a and 3b. The<br>
electrodes 6a and 6b are arranged on the inner faces of<br>
the substrate units 3a and 3b that are facing each other.<br>
The electrodes 6a and 6b are spaced apart from each other<br>
by a distance of about 0.05 millimeters, and they are not<br>
in direct electrical contact with each other. At least<br>
one of the electrodes 6a or 6b may be based on indium and<br>
tin oxide (ITO) or on fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2,F).<br>
They are separated by a cavity 6c that is filled with an electrelyte. The electrolyte could be liquid, but it is<br>
preferably solid. The electrolyte may also be replaced by<br>
an organic or an inorganic material having p-type<br>
conductive properties, i.e. constituted by a hole<br>
conductor.<br>
The photo-electrochemical cell incorporates<br>
elements that are capable of absorbing a fraction of the<br>
light passing through the lens 3. By way of example,<br>
these elements may be nanocrystals or fullerenes. When<br>
the photo-electrochemical cell contains nanocrystals of<br>
metallic oxides, it may be of the type described in the<br>
article "A low-cost, high-efficiency solar cell based on<br><br>
dye-sensitized colloidal TiO2 films" by Brian O'Regan and<br>
Michael Graetzel, Nature 353 (1991), pp. 737-740. Under<br>
such circumstances, the nanocrystals are based on<br>
titanium oxide (TiO2) and have molecules of a dye grafted<br>
to their surfaces. Reference can be made to the above-<br>
mentioned article for further details on such a<br>
photovoltaic cell and methods of making it.<br>
The liquid crystal system 5 is placed between the<br>
substrates 3a and 3c. Two connections 9a and 9b connect<br>
the photovoltaic cell 6 to the liquid crystal system 5.<br>
The connection 9a connects the electrode 6a to one of the<br>
power supply terminals of the liquid crystal system 5,<br>
and the connection 9b connects the electrode 6b to the<br>
other power supply terminal of the system 5. Each of the<br>
connections 9a and 9b may have a configuration and a<br>
method of assembly of the same kind as described above<br>
with reference to Figure lb.<br>
Figures 2a and 2b do not show a circuit for<br>
controlling the voltage supplied by the photovoltaic cell<br>
6 to the liquid crystal system 5. Such a control circuit<br>
may be incorporated in the lens 3 of Figures 2a and 2b<br>
within an opaque component analogous to that described<br>
with reference to Figures la and lb. Preferably, in the<br>
second embodiment described, the control circuit is implemented in a form that is directly integrated with<br>
one of the substrate units of the lens 3. In known<br>
manner, the control circuit may then also be transparent.<br>
It can be located in any portion of the surface of the<br>
lens 3 without reducing the field of view and without<br>
impeding the wearer of the spectacles.<br>
In all embodiments of the invention, each lens may<br>
further comprise means for interrupting the supply of<br>
power from the photovoltaic cell to the electro-optical<br>
means. Such control means may comprise a switch that is<br>
connected in suitable manner. In particular, such a<br>
switch may be disposed on one of the connections<br><br>
connecting the photovoltaic cell to the electro-optical<br>
means. It then makes it possible to open the electrical<br>
circuit which powers the electro-optical means, so as to<br>
interrupt the supply of power thereto. The switch may<br>
also be connected between the power supply inputs of the<br>
electro-optical means. Short circuiting the power supply<br>
terminals of the electro-optical means then causes the<br>
optical function to be switched off. Such a switch can be<br>
controlled manually. It may be a miniature switch placed<br>
flush with the anterior surface of the lens. In<br>
particular, it may be a switch incorporated in an opaque<br>
component as described above.<br>
Each lens may also include a photodiode or a<br>
phototransistor suitably connected to set intensity<br>
thresholds of incident light and particular modes of<br>
activating or deactivating the optical function. Such a<br>
photosensitive electronic component may also be<br>
incorporated in the opaque component. In a variant, it<br>
may be partially transparent and integrated directly in<br>
one of the substrate units of the lens.<br>
Finally, it should be understood that the invention<br>
presented above in the context of an application to<br>
spectacles lenses may also be applied to any other vision<br>
device. Specifically, such vision devices may comprise a<br>
helmet for a driver or a motorcyclist, or goggles for<br>
climbing or skiing. The photovoltaic cell and the<br>
electro-optical system are then integrated with the visor<br>
of the helmet or in the lens(es) of the goggles.<br><br>
