 <br>
 <br>
SKIN LIGHTENING AGENTS, COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
 <br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
WO 2007/112854	PCT/EP2007/002443<br>
-1-<br>
SKIN LIGHTENING AGENTS, COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS<br>
The    invention    relates    to    cosmetic    compositions    and    methods    using    N-acylbenzothiazolones and  derivative  compounds,   and   more  specifically,   using   3-5     propionytbenzothiazol-2-one and derivative compounds as skin tightening agents.<br>
Many people are concerned with the degree of pigmentation of their skin. For example, people with age spots or freckles may wish such pigmented spots to be less pronounced. Others may wish to reduce the skin darkening caused by exposure to sunlight or to<br>
10 lighten their natural skin color. To meet this need, many attempts have been made to develop products that reduce the pigment production in the melanocytes. However, the substances identified thus far tend to have either low efficacy or undesirable side effects, such as, for example, toxicity or skin irritation. Therefore, there is a continuing need for new cosmetic skin lightening agents, with improved overall effectiveness.<br>
15<br>
For example, certain resorcinol derivatives, particularly 4-substitiuted resorcinol derivatives, are useful in cosmetic compositions for skin lightening benefits, as disclosed in Hu et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,132,740; Bradley, et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,504,037 and 6,861,564; Japanese published patent applications JP 2001 -010925 and JP2000-327557;<br>
20     and Harichian et at., U.S. Patent No. 6,852,310.<br>
Applicants have now discovered that N-acylbenzothiazolones, particularly 3-propionylbenzothiazol-2-one, and derivative compounds deliver skin lightening benefits. The general chemical formulas and structures of these compounds are discussed in more 25 detail herein below. The 3-propionylbenzothiazol-2-one and derivative compounds have been found to be cosmetically effective and possibly less irritating to the skin. These compounds of the present invention have not been used in cosmetics, nor have they been used, specifically, for lightening skin.<br>
30 The synthesis of 3-propionylbenzothiazol-2-one is described in Ucar, et al., "Fries-Like Rearrangement: a Novel and Efficient Method for the Synthesis of 6-Acyl-2(3H)-benzoxazolones and 6-Acvl-2(3H)-penzothiazolones." Tetrahedron. 54:1763-1771 (1998). Ucar, et al., "Synthesis and Anticonvulsant Activity of 2(3H)-BenzoxaxoIone and 2 (3H)-benzothiazolone Derivatives," J. Med. Chem. 41:1138-1145 (1998) discloses evaluation<br>
35     of 2(3H)- benzothiazolone derivatives for anticonvulsant activity.<br>

COSMETICALLY ACCEPTABLE CARRIER<br>
The cosmetically acceptable vehicle may act as a dilutant, dispersant or earner for the skin benefit ingredients in the composition, so as to facilitate iheir distribution when the composition is applied to the skin. 5<br>
The vehicle may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. Preferably, the compositions are aqueous or an emulsion, especially water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion, preferably oil in water emulsion. Water when present will be in amounts which may range from 5 to 99%, preferably from 20 to 70%, optimally between 40 and 70% by weight.<br>
10<br>
Besides water, relatively volatile solvents may also serve as carriers within compositions of the present invention. Most preferred are monohydric C1-C3 alkanols. These include ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol and isopropyt alcohol. The amount of monohydric alkanol may range from 1 to 70%, preferably from 10 to 50%, optimally between 15 to 40% by weight.<br>
15<br>
Emollient materials may also serve as cosmetically acceptable carriers. These may be in the form of silicone oils and synthetic esters. Amounts of the emollients may range anywhere from 0.1 to 50%, preferably between 1 and 20% by weight.<br>
20 Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and non-volatile variety. The term "volatile" as used herein refers to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at ambient temperature. Volatile silicone oils are preferably chosen from cyclic or linear polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9, preferably from 4 to 5, silicon atoms. Linear volatile silicone materials generally have viscosities less than about 5 centistokes at 25°C<br>
25 while cyclic materials typically have viscosities of less than about 10 centistokes. Non¬volatile silicone oils useful as an emollient material include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane copolymers. The essentially non-volatile polyalkyl siloxanes useful herein include, for example, polydimethyl siloxanes with viscosities of from about 5 to about 25 million centistokes at 25°C. Among the preferred non-volatile emollients<br>
30 useful in the present compositions are the polydimethyl siloxanes having viscosities from about 10 to about 400 centistokes at 25C.<br>
Among the ester emollients are:<br>

USE OF THE COMPOSITION 5     The method according to the invention is intended primarily as using a personal care product for topical application to human skin, for cosmetic benefits including but not limited to skin lightening.<br>
The inventive compounds and compositions may be used for reducing overall skin 10     pigmentation and the reduction of discrete hyperpigmentation, such as blemishes and freckles, as well as for reducing the irritation associated with irritating skin benefit agents, such as retinof.<br>
In use, a small quantity of the composition, for example from 1 to 5 ml, is applied to areas 15     of the skin, from a suitable container or applicator and, if necessary, it is then spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hand or fingers or a suitable device.<br>
PRODUCT FORM AND PACKAGING<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The cosmetic composition useful for the method of the invention can be formulated as a lotion having a viscosity of from 4,000 to 10,000 mPas, a fluid cream having a viscosity of from 10,000 to 20,000 mPas or a cream having a viscosity of from 20,000 to 100,000 mPas, or above. The composition can be packaged in a suitable container to suit its viscosity and intended use by the consumer. For example, a lotion or fluid cream can be packaged in a bottle or a roll-ball applicator or a propellant-driven aerosol device or a container fitted with a pump suitable for finger operation. When the composition is a cream, it can simply be stored in a non-deformable bottle or squeeze container, such as a tube or a lidded jar. When the composition is a solid or semi-solid stick, it may be packaged in a suitable container for manually or mechanically pushing out or extruding the composition.<br>
The invention accordingly also provides a closed container containing a cosmetically acceptable composition as herein defined.<br>
The following examples are by way of example, not by way of limitation, of the principles 35     of the present invention, to illustrate the best mode of carrying out the invention.<br>

EXAMPLE 11<br>
This example shows the skin lightening effect of using 3-propionylbenzothiazol-2-one as a skin lightening agent in accordance with the inventive method. This experiment was carried 15     out using MatTek Corporation MelanoDerm cultures. Luminescence was measured using a chromameter to assay the degree of meianization of a 3-D skin model.<br>
Method for MelanoDerm Cultures<br>
MelanoDerm cultures were obtained from MatTek Corporation, Ashland, Massachusetts.<br>
20     The MelanoDerm was maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions.    The<br>
basal media used for the maintenance of the MelanoDerm cultures was Dulbecco's<br>
Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) supplemented with unspecified quantities of epidermal<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/112854<br>
 <br>

 <br>
-13-<br>
growth   factor,   insulin,   hydrocortisone,   and   proprietary   epidermal   differentiation compounds, in addition to anti-fungal agents and antibiotics.<br>
For the long term maintenance of the MelanoDerms, the basal media was supplemented<br>
5     with both basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and a rnelanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-<br>
MSH), compounds which are stimulators of melanocyte growth and melanogenesis. The<br>
cultures were fed every other day for a total of two weeks.   Fresh active preparations,<br>
prepared in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or culture media, were also applied to the<br>
MelanoDerms when feeding was performed.   Each treatment condition was done in<br>
10     duplicate and digital photographs were taken of the MelanoDerm cultures to assess<br>
overall pigmentation. Microscopic images of the MelanoDerms were taken to assess the<br>
cell viability of the keratinocytes and melanocytes.  For further evidence that the<br>
treatments were/not cytotoxic,  an  lactate  dehydrogenase (LDH)  assay  (Promega,<br>
Madison,. Wl,l was performed on Ihe supematanis from 24 hour post-treatment cultures.<br>

Solvable Melanin Assay<br>
To prepare tissues for assay:<br>
After treatment, tissues are usually frozen until completion of the experiment.   Thaw<br>
tissues, a few at a time and place in Dulbecco's phospnated buffer solution (D-PBS) to<br>
20 remove excess phenol red from the culture medium and residual test article. Remove a single tissue from the insert. Blot dry and place in 1.7 ml. microfuge tube. Repeat for all samples. Add 250 ul Solvable™ (Tissue and Gel Solubilizer 0.5 M—Packard BioScience Co. Catalogue No. 6NE9100 (NEF910)). Close the tube and make sure that the tissue is completely submerged. Incubate at 60° C overnight along with standards. In<br>
25 the morning, vortex the samples. Sometimes thick tissues will require additional time to complete the solution process.<br>
To prepare standard:<br>
Dissolve melanin (Sigma cat M 8631) in Solvable™ at 1mg/ml.   The solution may be 30     warmed gently for 15 minutes at 37° C. Store solution in dark.<br>
To prepare standard curve:<br>
Prepare dilutions from the standard containing 0ug to 250 ug of melanin in a total of 250<br>
ul Solvable™. Incubate dilutions along with samples.<br>
 <br>

To read assay:<br>
Cool samples and standards. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet. Fill microwell plate (C-96) with 200 ul each of samples and standards. There is some foaming of samples when pipetted. Blow gently across the samples to break bubbles 5 prior to reading the plate. Read plate at 490nm. The results are shown in the table below.<br>
