				<td>METHOD OF CONTROLLING ACETIC ACID PROCESS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present disclosure relates to control of processes for making acetic acid by<br>
carbonylation of methanol or carbonylatable derivative thereof, and particularly to process<br>
control during process upsets and during recovery therefrom.<br>
Technical Background<br>
Among currently employed processes for synthesizing acetic acid, one of the most useful<br>
commercially is the catalyzed carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide as taught in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,769,329 issued to Paulik et al. on Oct. 30,1973. The carbonylation catalyst<br>
contains rhodium, either dissolved or otherwise dispersed in a liquid reaction medium or<br>
supported on an inert solid, along with a halogen-containing catalyst promoter such as methyl<br>
iodide. The rhodium can be introduced into the reaction system in any of many forms, and the<br>
exact nature of the rhodium moiety within the active catalyst complex is uncertain. Likewise,<br>
the nature of the halide promoter is not critical. The patentees disclose a very large number of<br>
suitable promoters, most of which are organic iodides. Most typically and usefully, the reaction<br>
is conducted by continuously bubbling carbon monoxide gas through a liquid reaction medium<br>
in which the catalyst is dissolved or suspended.<br>
An improvement in the prior art process for the carbonylation of an alcohol to produce<br>
the carboxylic acid having one carbon atom more than the alcohol in the presence of a rhodium<br>
catalyst is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,001,259, issued Mar. 19, 1991;<br>
5,026,908, issued Jun. 25, 1991; and 5,144,068, issued Sep. 1, 1992; and European Patent No.<br>
EP 0 161 874 B2, published Jul. 1,1992. As disclosed therein, acetic acid is produced from<br>
methanol, or a carbonylatable derivative thereof, in a reaction medium containing methyl<br>
acetate, methyl halide, especially methyl iodide, and rhodium present in a catalytically effective<br>
concentration. These patents disclose that catalyst stability and the productivity of the<br>
carbonylation reactor can be maintained at surprisingly high levels, even at very low water<br>
concentrations, i.e. 4 weight percent or less, in the reaction medium (despite the general<br>
industrial practice of maintaining approximately 14-15 wt % water) by maintaining in the<br>
reaction medium, along with a catalytically effective amount of rhodium and at least a finite<br>
concentration of water, a specified concentration of iodide ions over and above the iodide<br>
content which is present as methyl iodide or other organic iodide. The iodide ion is present as a<br><br>
simple salt, with lithium iodide being preferred. The patents teach that the concentration of<br>
methyl acetate and iodide salts are significant parameters in affecting the rate of carbonylation<br>
of methanol to produce acetic acid, especially at low reactor water concentrations. By using<br>
relatively high concentrations of the methyl acetate and iodide salt, one obtains a surprising<br>
degree of catalyst stability and reactor productivity even when the liquid reaction medium<br>
contains water in concentrations as low as about 0.1 wt %, so low that it can broadly be defined<br>
simply as "a finite concentration" of water. Furthermore, the reaction medium employed<br>
improves the stability of the rhodium catalyst, i.e. resistance to catalyst precipitation, especially<br>
during the product recovery steps of the process. In these steps, distillation for the purpose of<br>
recovering the acetic acid product tends to remove from the catalyst the carbon monoxide which<br>
in the environment maintained in the reaction vessel, is a ligand with stabilizing effect on the<br>
rhodium. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,001,259, 5,026,908 and 5,144,068 are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
As with any complex chemical process, the methanol carbonylation process described<br>
above requires monitoring and control of a number of process conditions such as methanol and<br>
carbon monoxide feed rates, reactor temperature and pressure, flasher temperature and pressure,<br>
distillation conditions, and the like. In particular, process conditions are carefully controlled to<br>
ensure that the acetic acid product is extremely pure, and in particular that it is substantially free<br>
of water, methanol and propionic acid. Consequently, when one or more of these process<br>
conditions changes suddenly due to an unexpected event such as a sudden decrease in carbon<br>
monoxide supply, failure of a catalyst pump, or the like, the production rate must be adjusted â€”<br>
usually downward ~ to ensure that the acetic acid product continues to meet quality<br>
specifications. It is desirable, however, to return to normal operating conditions as rapidly as<br>
possible after a process disturbance. It has been observed, however, that process controllers<br>
employing standard linear control algorithms do not provide sufficiently rapid recovery from<br>
large-magnitude process disturbances because the controllers are tuned to maintain control over<br>
the narrow range of "normal" operating conditions rather than the broad range resulting from a<br>
significant disturbance. In particular, linear controllers are limited in that the controller gain<br>
(i.e., the relationship between the magnitude of a deviation from target conditions associated<br>
with certain control variable(s), and the magnitude of the corrective control action achieved<br>
using manipulated variable(s)) is fixed rather than changeable. An example of a gain is the<br>
amount of steam flow change required to a heat exchanger to cause a one degree change in<br>
temperature of a process stream. During rate changes, such as upsets, the composition of the<br><br><br>
process stream will change resulting in a change in the amount of stream required to<br>
affected the one degree change in temperature. Because of this limitation of linear<br>
controllers, most multivariable predictive controllers are not capable of maintaining<br>
control and recovering quickly from large-magnitude process disturbances. Even where<br>
these controlled operate based on an empirical or theoretical model of the process, an<br>
underlying assumption of their control scheme is usually that the process gains (i.e., the<br>
magnitude of the process's response to a control action) are more or less linear. This<br>
assumption turns out to be somewhat unreliable for chemical processes, particularly<br>
where the deviation from the target conditions is very large or where a number of<br>
interrelated reactions are occurring simultaneously.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0018213 to Thiebaut is directed<br>
towards a process for monitoring acetic acid and/or methyl acetate production in a<br>
continuous preparative process by the carbonylation of methanol or a carbonylatable<br>
derivative of methanol with carbon monoxide in the liquid phase, in the presence of water<br>
and a homogeneous catalyst system, carried out in an industrial installation comprising a<br>
reaction zone, a flash zone and a distillative purification zone, wherein the reactor<br>
temperature and the feed rate of the methanol or carbonylatable derivative in said reactor<br>
are brought under the control, preferably via a multivariable predictive controller, of the<br>
carbon monoxide feed rate and at least one of the parameters defining the composition of<br>
the reaction medium and/or the vents. However, the process is directed towards<br>
controlling during normal operational conditions, and not during a change in a process<br>
conditions, nor a change in a process equipment condition.<br>
This is exactly the situation in an acetic acid reactor, where in addition to<br>
methanol carbonylation, one methanol molecule can react (reversibly) with an acetic acid<br>
molecule to form methyl acetate and water; two methanol molecules can react to form<br>
dimethyl ether and water; and the methyl acetate can also react directly with carbon<br><br><br>
monoxide and water to form acetic acid. In fact, it turns out that at least some of the<br>
process gains for a methanol carbonylation reactor are not only nonlinear but actually<br>
change sign depending on the process conditions. During significant process upsets in a<br>
methanol carbonylation process, gains are particularly unlikely to be constant, making<br>
linear control less effective.<br>
Notwithstanding the perceived deficiencies of linear model-based controllers for<br>
acetic acid reaction systems, it has generally not been considered appropriate to employ<br>
nonlinear controllers for this application. Until now, it has generally been thought that<br>
nonlinear controllers are best employed in environments where process setpoints are<br>
deliberately changed (e.g. to change a product grade) and the objective is to minimize the<br>
transition time between grades. Existing nonlinear control applications have focused on<br>
production of polymers where there are frequent changes in product grades. These<br>
applications have not focused on rate related changes. There remains a need, however, for<br>
control systems that are capable of managing nonlinear processes in response to<br>
unexpected disturbances so as to provide rapid recovery.<br>
One such system now available commercially is a system from ASPEN<br>
Technology that employs two separate components to manage a process upset. In<br>
addition to a dynamic controller for maintaining control until a disruption has been<br>
addressed, ASPEN's solution employs a separate gain-scheduling component that is<br>
designed to manage the return to normal operating conditions. In effect, the gain<br>
scheduler treats the return from abnormal to normal conditions as a grade change and<br>
imposes upon the return a series of essentially linear transitions. Nevertheless, there<br>
remains a need for a control system that integrates these components. The present<br>
disclosure achieves this objective.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present disclosure describes a method of controlling a process for<br>
producing acetic acid by carbonylation of methanol or a carbonylatable derivative thereof that<br>
comprises monitoring the rate of production of the acetic acid; reducing the production rate in<br>
response to a change in a process condition or a process equipment condition; after tire<br>
production rate is reduced, controlling the process at the reduced production rate; and increasing<br>
the production rate after said condition change has been addressed until at least the production<br>
rate returns to a normal operating range; wherein during at least one of the steps of reducing the<br>
production rate, controlling the process at the reduced production rate, and increasing the<br>
production rate until the production rate returns to a normal operating range, the process is<br>
controlled by nonlinear multivariate control based on a model of the process. The disclosed<br>
method can maintain control during a variety of condition changes, including but not limited to<br>
one or more of the following: (a) substantial reductions in carbon monoxide availability; (b)<br>
failure of a catalyst or feed pump; (c) loss of heating or cooling capacity; (d) flooding of a<br>
downstream purification column; (e) significant deviations from expected compositions in one<br>
or more streams associated with a purification column (for example, insufficient water or<br>
excessive acetic acid in the overhead of the light ends column, which can result in loss of phase<br>
separation); (f) a shortage of storage capacity for acetic acid product; and similar changes. The<br>
method is also capable of maintaining control where the transition is a planned production rate<br>
or grade change.<br>
In another aspect, the present disclosure describes a process for producing acetic acid by<br>
carbonylation of methanol, including the step of controlling at least a reaction section of the<br>
process and/or a purification section of the process using a multivariable nonlinear predictive<br>
controller based on a nonlinear model of the process. The controller employs the same process<br>
model to control the process during normal operations, during a process upset condition and also<br>
during a recovery period after the upset has been addressed.<br>

Description of Illustrative Embodiments'<br>
One or more illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the<br>
interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification.<br>
It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment,<br>
numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific<br>
goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary<br>
from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development<br>
effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking<br>
for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
Figure 1 depicts a commonly used methanol carbonylation process for producing acetic<br>
acid. As explained in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,769,329 and 5,001,259, which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference, the carbonylation reaction is typically carried out by introducing carbon monoxide<br>
and a feed containing methanol, and/or a carbonylatable derivative thereof, into a stirred reactor<br>
with a catalyst, for example a rhodium or iridium catalyst, an organic iodide such as methyl<br>
iodide, and (in the case of a rhodium catalyst) an inorganic iodide such as lithium iodide as<br>
described above. The reactor effluent is flashed to recover catalyst and inorganic iodide. This is<br>
often accomplished in a separate vessel, not shown in Figure 1, from which the residue is<br>
recycled to the reactor and the overhead product is subjected to additional purification. The<br><br>
product from the flash is subjected to a series of distillations to purify the acetic acid product by<br>
removing and recycling unreacted methanol, methyl acetate, and methyl iodide in a "light ends"<br>
or "splitter" column; removing water in a drying column; and (if necessary) removing propionic<br>
acid, other carbonyl-containing compounds such as crotonaldehyde, and higher alkyl iodides<br>
such as hexyl iodide in a "heavy ends" column. A number of further refinements are known; for<br>
example, the overhead from the light ends column typically consists of distinct heavy and light<br>
liquid phases that are separated in a "decanter" vessel and that may be separately processed (e.g.<br>
to remove alkanes or acetaldehyde) before being returned to the reactor. It is generally known<br>
that inability to maintain this liquid-liquid phase separation is indicative of certain process<br>
problems that, if uncorrected, can significantly impair the performance of the process.<br>
It will likewise be understood that a number of other process disruptions may require a<br>
temporary reduction in the production rate of acetic acid until the problem is corrected. For<br>
example, a significant reduction in the supply of either carbon monoxide or methanol to the<br>
reactor will clearly require a reduction in the production rate. Less obviously, failure of a<br>
catalyst pump or loss of steam for heating the distillation columns may also require a temporary<br>
rate reduction. Flooding of a purification column, which indicates a composition change in the<br>
reaction system, may also require a rate reduction. As a practical matter, rate reductions may<br>
also be necessary if there is a shortage of available storage capacity for the acetic acid product.<br>
When a process disruption requires a reduction in the acetic acid production rate, it is of<br>
course very important to minimize the duration of the rate reduction. Where a disruption is<br>
relatively minor, a typical linear multivariable predictive controller can correct it automatically;<br>
but in the case of a major disruption, the predictive model provided in the controller is typically<br>
not robust enough to correctly calculate the required corrective action. In particular, because<br>
such a controller assumes that process gains are linear, the controller output will change very<br>
slowly (and at a constant rate) to avoid overcompensation. As a result, it may take several<br>
hours, or even days, for an acetic acid process to recover from a severe process disturbance even<br>
after the disturbance itself has been addressed. When a plant is operating at or close to capacity<br>
because demand is high, extended delays in returning to full capacity may amount to millions of<br>
dollars of lost profits.<br>
One alternative approach that has met with some success is "gain scheduling". This<br>
approach employs a limited number of distinct sets of controller tuning parameters to control<br>
discrete, well-characterized operating regions within the overall operating range of the process.<br>
In effect, this approach addresses nonlinear process gains by subdividing the process into<br><br>
operating regions within which the process gain is more or less linear. The two principal<br>
challenges in implementing this approach are the development of multiple, distinct sets of<br>
control parameters and accurate identification of the transition points between operating regions.<br>
It is also extremely important to ensure that process control is maintained during a<br>
serious process disturbance. For all effective purposes, it may not be possible, or appropriate, to<br>
subdivide the recovery period into multiple linear regions. Thus, gain-scheduling systems are<br>
rendered ineffective. Gain-scheduling systems are not especially suitable for managing process<br>
disturbances because they are primarily designed to facilitate planned transitions between two<br>
operating states, not to expedite recovery from an unexpected and significant change in<br>
operating conditions. In particular, the gain-scheduling approach would effectively require a<br>
separate set of process tuning parameters for recovery from each likely disturbance. By way of<br>
contrast, a nonlinear model-based control system according to the present invention would<br>
require only a single set of control parameters because the model itself accounts for process<br>
disturbances.<br>
As noted above, until recently the use of model-based nonlinear process control has been<br>
thought inappropriate for complex chemical processes such as methanol carbonylation because<br>
of the large number of competing reactions and the complex behavior of the process gains, as<br>
well as the high cost of developing an accurate process model suitable for implementation of<br>
nonlinear control. The Applicants have discovered, however, that nonlinear control based on an<br>
accurate process model can provide significantly faster recovery from process disturbances than<br>
a gain-scheduling or similar approach because the controller is better able to correctly predict the<br>
effect of controller output changes on the process. This faster recovery translates into increased<br>
profitability because the process returns more quickly to operation at its optimum capacity.<br>
This improved recovery time is depicted schematically in Figure 2, which is a generic<br>
plot of acid production rate versus time. A target production rate R1 is maintained until time t1,<br>
when a process disturbance (such as a sudden reduction in carbon monoxide supply) requires a<br>
reduction of the production rate to R2 at time t2 until t3, when the condition requiring the rate<br>
cut is corrected. Using nonlinear model-based control according to the present invention, a<br>
nonlinear multivariable controller returned the process to production rate Rl at time t4. In<br>
contrast, because a linear multivariable controller operates only over a narrow operating range,<br>
the process recovery is usually managed by a combination of linear automatic control and direct<br>
operator control. Under these conditions, the process returns more slowly to production Rate<br>
R1. Under nonlinear model-based control according to the present invention, the controller is<br><br>
better able to predict the effects of controller output changes, allowing a faster response. As a<br>
result, the process returns to steady state faster. This is depicted in Figure 3, in which using<br>
linear model-based control in combination with direct operator control, the process is returned t<br>
steady state along curve A, reaching original rate R1 at a time t5. By contrast, using nonlinear<br>
model-based control in accordance with a process of the present invention, the process is<br>
returned to steady state along the steeper (i.e. faster) curve B, reaching original rate Rl at a time<br>
t4. It will be appreciated that the process recovers much faster from a process disturbance when<br>
the control system is based on an accurate nonlinear model of the process.<br>
Nonlinear model-based control according to the present invention can, in various<br>
embodiments, also be used to control the process during the time the condition requiring the rate<br>
cut is being corrected, i.e., between time t2 and t3. Because the reduced production rate, R2,<br>
may be unique for each individual type of process upset and, indeed, for different occurrences of<br>
the same process upset, the nonlinear model-based control has benefits over a linear model-<br>
based control during this corrective period. If linear model-based control is used during this<br>
time, distinct sets of control parameters would have to be developed for each conceivable<br>
process upset. Similarly, it is contemplated that nonlinear model-based control according to the<br>
present invention can, in various embodiments, also be used to control the process during the<br>
time the production rate is being cut, i.e., between time t1 and t2.<br>
Accordingly, the applicants have found that for the methanol carbonylation process, the<br>
perceived deficiencies of nonlinear control no longer outweigh the advantages. In particular, the<br>
high cost of developing a predictive model that fully accounts for nonlinearities in the process<br>
gains is offset by the potential cost savings resulting from the faster return to steady state that<br>
such a model allows.<br>
Suitable control software for implementing multivariable nonlinear control includes a<br>
Galaxy Nonlinear Control system from PAS, Inc. The PAS NOVAÂ® modeling system or a<br>
similar package may be used to develop a first-principles model of the system. This system is<br>
particularly appropriate for the acetic acid process because it is capable of modeling the complex<br>
reaction scheme in the reactor as well as the downstream separation processes. Unlike linear<br>
model predictive control systems, the Galaxy system takes account of process nonlinearities so<br>
hat a single set of controller tuning parameters can be used to manage the entire process. This<br>
iffers fundamentally from the "gain scheduling" approach in which separate sets of control<br>
irameters are implemented depending on the present process conditions.<br><br>
It will be recognized by those of skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that<br>
for any specific acetic acid process the dependent variables, e.g., control variables, and<br>
independent variables, e.g., manipulated variables and external disturbances, are likely to be<br>
different. While the various process implementations are likely to have certain such dependent<br>
and independent variables in common, there are likely also to be differences among the various<br>
implementations. Similarly, the set of gains that will be of primary interest for process control<br>
will be different for each implementation of a methanol carbonylation process. While certain<br>
gains will likely be of interest to each of the process implementations, certain gains can be<br>
expected to be of importance for only certain process implementations. Likewise, the<br>
significance of any gain will for modeling purposes vary among the processes.<br>
A typical methanol carbonylation process may have as many as 20 to 25 dependent<br>
variables associated with target conditions and as many as 15 to 20 independent variables that<br>
provide corrective control. Dependent variables that can be expected to be common to many<br>
methanol carbonylation processes include carbon monoxide supply valve output - percent open;<br>
carbon monoxide supply flow; reactor cooling valve output - percent open; reactor level; reactor<br>
to flash flow valve output - percent open; catalyst recycle flow valve output - percent open;<br>
light ends column differential pressure; light ends column overhead decanter heavy phase<br>
specific gravity; drying column differential pressures; drying column control temperature;<br>
drying column bottom section water concentration; drying column residue water concentration;<br>
drying column steam flow valve output; and drying column overhead receiver level. It will be<br>
recognized by those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure that all of these<br>
dependent variables may not be relevant to certain processes and that additional dependent<br>
variable may be relevant to certain processes.<br>
Independent variables that can be expected to be common to many methanol<br>
carbonylation processes include methanol feed flow; reactor temperature; reactor to flasher flow;<br>
drying column control temperature; drying column overhead receiver reflux to drying column<br>

With the number of dependent variables and independent variables that might be relevant<br>
to any particular process implementation, the number of potential gains that might be considered<br>
for nonlinear multivariable control is potentially considerable. As might be determined from<br><br>
modeling of the process, gains (indicated below as independent variable: dependent variable)<br>
that might be expected to be common to many methanol carbonylation process implementations<br>
include a) drying column control temperature: drying column residue water concentration; b)<br>
drying column control temperature: drying column steam flow valve output; c) drying column<br>
overhead receiver pressure: drying column differential pressures; d) drying column overhead<br>

additional gains may be relevant to models of certain processes. Specific choices in gains to be<br>
included in a model will vary from process to process and will vary upon numerous factors,<br>
including, but not limited to, control objectives, control strategy, and other practical<br>
considerations, such as signal reliability. The effort to identify the gains that should be used for<br>
nonlinear multivariable control for any specific process, while possibly complex and time-<br>
consuming, would be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the<br>
benefit of this disclosure.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the model-based control system also includes<br>
real-time economic optimization capability. This feature allows the system to identify and<br>
implement control changes that optimize the production rate of acetic acid relative to the cost of<br>
feeds and utilities (e.g. steam and electricity) so that the process can operate at the most<br>
economically beneficial conditions.<br>
To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples of<br>
certain aspects of some embodiments are given. In no way should the following examples be<br>
read to limit, or define, the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
A methanol carbonylation process, such as generally depicted in Figure 1, was operated<br>
in low-water mode under steady state conditions at a target production rate Rl, based on<br>
methanol flow.<br>
At time t1, the process was subjected to an upset whereby a reduction of carbon<br>
monoxide flow was experienced. At time t2, the process was being operated at a reduced<br>
production rate R2, which was 32 % of the rate at R1. At that time, the process was put under<br>
maltivariable nonlinear model-based control, obtained from first-principles modeling. The<br>
conditions when the process was operating at time t2, provided as either a difference from the<br>
respective conditions prior to the process upset or as a percentage of the respective condition<br>
prior to the process upset (100%), were as follows:<br>
Temperature Difference: -12 Â°C<br>
Reactor pressure: 94.6 %<br>
Carbon monoxide flow: 32 %<br>
At time t3, the carbon monoxide flow was restored. At that time, the process was being<br>
operated at a production rate that was 31 % of the rate at Rl. The process conditions at time t3,<br>
provided as either a difference from the respective conditions prior to the process upset or as a<br>
percentage of the respective condition prior to the process upset (100%), were as follows:<br>
Temperature Difference: - 20 Â°C<br>
Reactor pressure: 100%<br>
Carbon monoxide flow: 31 %<br>
The process was maintained under multivariable nonlinear model-based control to return<br>
the process to the previous steady state conditions associated with the target production rate Rl,<br><br>
which was achieved at time t4. At time t4, the process conditions, provided as either a<br>
difference from the respective conditions prior to the process upset or as a percentage of the<br>
respective condition prior to the process upset (100%), were as follows:<br>
Temperature Difference: 
Reactor pressure: 100 %<br>
Carbon monoxide flow: 100 %<br>
The recovery from the reduced production rate R2 according to this example is indicated<br>
in Figure 2 and also by curve B in Figure 3.<br>
The bulk composition of the reaction medium, including, but not limited to, methyl<br>
iodide and methyl acetate levels, at times t2, t3, and t4 were essentially unchanged from those<br>
levels prior to the process upset, attesting to the ability of multivariable nonlinear model-based<br>
control to efficiently return the acetic acid process to target production rates following an upset.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
A methanol carbonylation process was operated as described in Example 1, except that at<br>
time t3, the process was put under a combination of operator managed regulatory control and<br>
multivariable linear model-based control to return the process to the previous steady state<br>
conditions associated with the target production rate R1, which was achieved at time t5. The<br>
recovery from the reduced production rate R2 according to this comparative example is<br>
indicated by curve A in Figure 3.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is well-adapted to carry out the objects and attain the ends and<br>
advantages mentioned as well as those which are inherent therein. While the invention has been<br>
depicted and described by reference to exemplary embodiments of the invention, such a<br>
reference does not imply a limitation on the invention, and no such limitation is to be inferred.<br>
The invention is capable of considerable modification, alternation, and equivalents in form and<br>
function, as will occur to those ordinarily skilled in the pertinent arts and having the benefit of<br>
this disclosure. For example, the present invention is not limited to the use of processes<br>
employing rhodium as a catalyst. The present invention can be applied to systems using other<br>
catalyst systems, including processes using iridium. The depicted and described embodiments<br>
of the invention are exemplary only, and are not exhaustive of the scope of the invention.<br>
Consequently, the invention is intended to be limited only by the spirit and scope of the<br>
