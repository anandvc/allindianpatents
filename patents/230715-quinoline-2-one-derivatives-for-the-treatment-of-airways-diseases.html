Compounds of formula I in free, salt or solvate form are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in free, salt or solvate form for use as a pharmaceutical. The compounds of formula I in free, salt or solvate form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as "agents of the invention", have good p2-adreno-receptor agonist activity. The p2 agonist activity, onset of action and duration of action of the agents of the invention may be tested using the guinea pig tracheal strip in vitro assay according to the procedure of R.A. Coleman and A.T. Nials, J. Pharmacol. Methods 1989, 21,71. The binding potency and selectivity for the p2-adrenoreceptor relative to the p 1-adrenoreceptor can be measured by a classical filtration binding assay according to the procedure of Current Protocols in Pharmacology (S. J. Enna (editor-in-chief) et al, John Wiley &amp; Son, Inc, 1998), or by cAMP determination in cells expressing p2- or p,-adrenoceptor, according to the procedure of B. January et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. 1998, 123, 701.<br>
The agents of the invention commonly have a rapid onset of action and have a prolonged stimulating action on the p2-adrenoreceptor, compounds of the Examples hereinbelow having Kj (P2) values of the order of 0.1 to 1000 nM, having durations of action of the order of 1 to greater than 12 hours. Many of the compounds have binding selectivites for the p2-adrenoreceptor relative to the pi-adrenoreceptor from 1.5 to 500.<br><br>
The compounds of Examples 1, 3, 4, 30, 33, 35, 55, 85 and 139 have p2 and Pi binding potencies, measured by a classical filtration binding assay, represented by Ki values (p2/pi) (in JJM) of 0.026/0.186, 0.054/0.050, 0.006/0.115, 0.077/0.132, 0.048/0.491, 0.0004/0.006, 0.1278 / 0.3835, 0.121/0.380 and 0.003/0.004 respectively.<br>
Having regard to their p2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of any condition which is prevented or alleviated by activation of the p2-adrenoreceptor. In view of their long acting selective p2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are useful in the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and the relief of bronchoconstriction. Relief of bronchoconstriction can be measured in models such as the in vivo plethysmography models of Chong et al, J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods 1998, 39, 163, Hammelmann et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 1997, 156, 766 and analogous models. The agents of the invention are therefore useful in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases. In view of their long duration of action, in most cases it is possible to administer the agents of the invention once-a-day in the treatment of such diseases. In another aspect, agents of the invention commonly exhibit characteristics indicating a low incidence of side effects commonly encountered with p2 agonists such as tachycardia, tremor and restlessness, such agents accordingly being suitable for use in on demand (rescue) treatment as well as prophylactic treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases.<br>
Treatment of a disease in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic treatment. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning<br><br>
dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant from any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include adult/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary or airways disease (COPD or CO AD), including chronic bronchitis, or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their p2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of a condition requiring relaxation of smooth muscle of the uterus or vascular system. They are thus useful for the prevention or alleviation of premature labour pains in pregnancy. They are also useful in the treatment of chronic and acute urticaria, psoriasis, allergic conjunctivitis, actinitis, hay fever, and mastocytosis.<br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in combination with other drug substances such as anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory, antihistamine, immunosuppressive or anti-tussive drug substances, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore, for example as potentiators of therapeutic activity of such drugs or as a means of reducing required dosaging or potential side effects of such drugs. An agent of the invention may be mixed with the other drug substance in a fixed pharmaceutical composition or it may be administered separately, before, simultaneously with or after the other drug substance. Accordingly the invention includes a combination of an agent of the invention as hereinbefore described with an anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory, antihistamine or anti-tussive drug substance, said agent of the invention and said drug substance being in the same or different pharmaceutical composition.<br><br>

Combinations of agents of the invention and anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, PDE4 inhibitors, A2a agonists, A2b agonists, dopamine receptor agonists or LTB4 antagonists maybe used, for example, in the treatment of asthma or, particularly, COPD.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides a method for the treatment of an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease which comprises administering to a subject, particularly a human subject, in need thereof a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore described.
