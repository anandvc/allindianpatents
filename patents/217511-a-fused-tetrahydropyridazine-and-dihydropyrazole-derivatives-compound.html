				<td>The    present    invention    relates    to    a    fused    tetrahydropyridazine    and dihydropyrazole compound.<br>
This invention relates to dipeptide compounds which are growth hormone secretagogues and are useful for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Growth hormone (GH), which is secreted from the pituitary gland, stimulates growth of all tissues of the body that are capable of growing. In addition, growth hormone is known to have the following basic "effects on the metabolic process of the body:<br>
1.	Increased rate of protein synthesis in substantially all cells of the<br>
body;<br>
2.	Decreased rate of carbohydrate utilization in cells of the body;.<br>
3.	Increased mobilization of free fatty acids   and use of fatty acids for<br>
energy.<br>
Deficiency in growth hormone results in a variety of medical disorders. In children, it causes dwarfism. In adults, the consequences of acquired GH deficiency include profound reduction in lean body mass and concomitant increase in total body fat, particularly in the truncal region. Decreased skeletal and cardiac muscle mass and muscle strength lead to a significant reduction in exercise capacity. Bone density is also reduced. Administration of exogenous growth hormone has been shown to reverse many of the metabolic changes. Additional benefits of therapy have included reduction in LDL cholesterol and improved psychological well-being.<br>
In cases where increased levels of growth hormone were desired, the problem was generally solved by providing exogenous growth hormone or by administering an agent which stimulated growth hormone production and/or release. In either case the peptidyl nature of the compound necessitated that it be administered by injection. Initially the source of growth hormone was the extraction of the pituitary glands of-cadavers. This resulted in an expensive product, and carried with it the risk that a disease associated with the source of the pituitary gland could be transmitted to the recipient of the growth hormone {e.g., Jacob-CreutzfeJd disease). Recently, recombinant growth hormone has become available which, while no longer carrying any risk of disease transmission, is still a very expensive product which must be given by injection or by a nasal spray.<br>
Most GH deficiencies are caused by defects in GH release,  not primary "defects   in   pituitary   synthesis   of  GH.     Therefore,   an   alternative   strategy  for<br>
normalizing serum GH levels is by stimulating its release from somatotrophs. Increasing GH secretion can be achieved by stimulating or inhibiting various neurotransmitter systems in the brain and hypothalamus. As a result, the development of synthetic growth hormone-releasing agents to stimulate pituitary GH secretion are being pursued, and may have several advantages over expensive and inconvenient GH replacement therapy. By acting along physiologic regulatory pathways, the most desirable agents would stimulate pulsatile GH secretion, and excessive levels of GH that have been associated with the undesirable side effects of exogenous GH administration would be avoided by virtue of intact negative feedback loops.<br>
Physiologic and pharmacologic stimulators of GH secretion include arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), glucagon, vasopressin, and insulin induced hypoglycemia, as well as activities such as sleep and exeruse, indirectly cause growth hormone to be released from the pituitary by acting in some fashion on the hypothalamus perhaps either to decrease somatostatin secretion or to increase the secretion of the known secretagogue growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) or an unknown endogenous growth hormone-releasing hormone or all of these.<br>
Other compounds have been developed which stimulate the release of endogenous growth hormone such as analogous peptidyl compounds related to GRF or the peptides of U.S. Patent 4,411,890. These peptides, while considerably smaller than growth hormones are still susceptible to various proteases. As with most peptides, their potential for oral bioavailability is low. WO 94/13696 refers to certain spiropiperidines and homologues which promote release of growth hormone. Preferred compounds are of the general structure shown below.<br><br>

WO 94/11012 refers to certain dipeptides that promote release of growth hormone. These dipeptides have the general structure<br><br>

The compounds of WO 94/11012 and WO 94/13696 are reported to be useful in the treatment of osteoporosis in combination with parathyroid hormone or a bisphosphonate.<br>

Prodrugs of this invention where a carboxyl group in a carboxylic acid of Formula (I) is replaced by an ester may be prepared by combining the carboxylic acid with the appropriate alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in an inert solvent such as DMF at a temperature of about 0°C to 100°C for about 1 to about 24 hours. Alternatively, the acid is combined with the appropriate alcohol as solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid such as concentrated sulfuric acid at a temperature of about 20°C to 120°C, preferably at reflux, for about 1 hour to about 24 hours. Another method is the reaction of the acid in an inert solvent such as THF, with concomitant removal of the water being produced by physical (e.g., Dean Stark trap) or chemical (e.g., molecular sieves) means.<br>

The compounds of the instant invention all have at least one asymmetric center as noted by the asterisk in the structural Formula I, above. Additional asymmetric centers may be present on the molecule depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all such optical isomers, as separated, pure or partially purified optical isomers, racemic mixtures or diastereomeric mixtures thereof, be included within the scope of the instant invention.   In the case of the asymmetric center represented by the asterisk, it has been found that the absolute stereochemistry of the more active and thus more preferred isomer is shown in Formula IA. This preferred absolute configuration also applies to Formula I.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
With the R4 substituent as hydrogen, the spatial configuration of the asymmetric center corresponds to that in a D-amino acid. In most cases this is also designated an R-configuration although this will vary according to the values of R3 and R4 used in making R- or S-stereochemical assignments.<br>
The instant compounds are generally isolated in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, such as the salts derived from using inorganic and organic acids. Examples of such acids are hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, maleic, succinic, D-tartaric, L-tartaric, malonic, methane sulfonic and the like. In addition, certain compounds containing an acidic function such as a carboxy can be isolated in the form of their inorganic salt in which the counter-ion can be selected from sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium and the like, as well as from organic bases.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are formed by taking about 1 equivalent of a compound of formula (I) and contacting it with about 1 equivalent of<br>
the appropriate corresponding acid of the salt which is desired.    Work-up and isolation of the resulting salt is well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The growth hormone releasing compounds of Formula I are useful in vitro as unique tools for understanding how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the pituitary level. This includes use in the evaluation of many factors thought or known to influence growth hormone secretion such as age, sex, nutritional factors, glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, as well as fasting and non-fasting states. In addition, the compounds of this invention can be used in the evaluation of how other hormones modify growth hormone releasing activity. For example, it has already been established that somatostatin inhibits growth hormone release.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered to animals, including humans, to release growth hormone in vivo. The compounds are useful for treatment of symptoms related to GH deficiency; stimulate growth or enhance feed efficiency of animals raised for meat production to improve carcass quality; to increase milk production in dairy cattle; improvement of bone or wound healing and improvement in vital organ function. The compounds of the present invention by inducing endogenous GH secretion will alter body composition and modify other GH-dependent metabolic, immunologic or developmental processes. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be given to chickens, turkeys, livestock animals (such as sheep, pigs, horses, cattle, etc.), companion animals (e.g., dogs) or may have utility in aquaculture to accelerate growth and improve the protein/fat ratio. In addition, these compounds can be administered to humans in vivo as a diagnostic tool to directly determine whether the pituitary is capable of releasing growth hormone. For example, the compounds of Formula I can be administered in vivo to children. Serum samples taken before and after such administration can be assayed for growth hormone. Comparison of the amounts of growth hormone in each of these samples would be a means for directly determining the ability of the patient's pituitary to release growth hormone.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one of the compounds of Formula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Optionally, the pharmaceutical compositions can further comprise an anabolic agent in addition to at least one of the compounds of Formula I or another compound which exhibits a<br>
different activity, e.g., an antibiotic growth permittant or an agent to treat osteoporosis or with other pharmaceutically active materials wherein the combination enhances efficacy and minimizes side effects.<br>
Growth promoting and anabolic agents include, but are not limited to, TRH, PTH, diethylstilbesterol, estrogens, B-agonists, theophylline, anabolic steroids, enkephalins, E series prostaglandins, compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,239,345, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, e.g., zeranol; compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,036,979, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, e.g., sulbenox; and peptides disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,411,890, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

The combination of a GH secretagogue of this invention with GRF results in synergistic increases of endogenous growth hormone.<br>
As is well known to those skilled in the art, the known and potential uses of growth hormone are varied and multitudinous [See "Human Growth Hormone", Strobe! and Thomas, Pharmacological Reviews, 4_fi, pg. 1-34 (1994); T. Rosen et al., Norm Res, 1995; 43: pp. 93-99; M. Degerblad et al., European Journal of Endocrinology, 1995, 133: pp. 180-188; J. O. Jorgensen, European Journal of Endocrinology, 1994, 130: pp. 224-228; K. C. Copeland et al., Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, Vol. 78 No. 5, pp. 1040-1047; J. A. Aloi et al., Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, Vol. 79 No. 4, pp. 943-949; F. Cordido et al., Metab. Clin. Exp., (1995), 44(6), pp. 745-748; K. M. Fairhall et al., J. Endocrinol., (1995), 145(3), pp. 417-426; RM. Frieboes et al.,<br>
Neuroendocrinology, (1995), 61(5), pp. 584-589; and M. Llovera et al., Int J. Cancer, (1995), 61(1), pp. 138-141]. Thus, the administration of the compounds of this invention for purposes of stimulating the release of endogenous growth hormone can have the same effects or uses as growth hormone itself. These varied uses of growth hormone may be summarized as follows: stimulating growth hormone release in elderly humans; treating growth hormone deficient adults; preventing catabolic side effects of glucocorticoids, treating osteoporosis, stimulating the immune system, acceleration of wound healing, accelerating bone fracture repair, treating growth retardation, treating congestive heart failure as disclosed in PCT publications WO 95/28173 and WO 95/28174 (an example of a method for assaying growth hormone secretagogues for efficacy in treating congestive heart failure is disclosed in R. Yang et al., Circulation, Vol. 92, No. 2, p.262, 1995), treating acute or chronic renal failure or insufficiency, treatment of physiological short stature, including growth hormone deficient children, treating short stature associated with chronic illness, treating obesity, treating growth retardation associated with Prader-Willi syndrome and Turner's syndrome; accelerating the recovery and reducing hospitalization of bum patients or following major surgery such as gastrointestinal surgery; treating intrauterine growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, hypercortisonism and Cushings syndrome; replacing growth hormone in stressed patients; treating osteochondrodysplasias, Noonans syndrome, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease, delayed wound healing, and psychosocial deprivation; treating of pulmonary dysfunction and ventilator dependency; attenuating protein catabolic response after a major operation; treating malabsorption syndromes, reducing cachexia and protein loss due to chronic illness such as cancer or AIDS; accelerating weight gain and protein accretion in patients on TPN (total parenteral nutrition); treating hyperinsulinemia including nesidioblastosis; adjuvant treatment for ovulation induction and to prevent and treat gastric and duodenal ulcers, stimulating thymic development and preventing age-related decline of thymic function; adjunctive therapy for patients on chronic hemodialysis; treating immunosuppressed patients and enhancing antibody response following vaccination; improving muscle strength, increasing muscle mass, mobility, maintenance of skin thickness, metabolic homeostasis, renal hemeostasis in the frail elderly; stimulating osteoblasts, bone remodelling, and cartilage growth; treating neurological diseases such as peripheral<br>
and drug induced neuropathy, Guillian-Barre Syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents and demyelinating diseases; stimulating the immune system in companion animals and treating disorders of aging in companion animals; growth promotant in livestock; and stimulating wool growth in sheep.<br>
It will be known to those skilled in the art that there are numerous compounds now being used in an effort to treat the diseases or therapeutic indications enumerated above. Combinations of these therapeutic agents, some of which have also been mentioned above, with the growth promotant,  exhibit anabolic and desirable properties of these various therapeutic agents.  In these combinations, the therapeutic agents and the growth hormone secretagogues of this invention may be independently and sequentially administered or co-administered in dose ranges from one one-hundredth to one times the dose levels which are effective when these compounds and secretagogues are used singly.     Combined therapy to inhibit bone resorption, prevent osteoporosis, reduce skeletal fracture, enhance the healing of bone fractures, stimulate bone formation and increase bone mineral density can be effectuated   by   combinations   of  bisphosphonates   and  the   growth   hormone secretagogues of this invention, see PCT publication WO 95/11029 for a discussion of combination therapy using bisphosphonates and GH secretagogues.  The use of bisphosphonates for these utilities has been reviewed, for example, by Hamdy, N.A.T.,   Role   of   Bisphosphonates   in   Metabolic   Bone   Diseases,   Trends   in Endocrinol. Metab., 1993, 4,   pages 19-25.   Bisphosphonates with these utilities include but are not limited to alendronate, tiludronate, dimethyl-APD, risedronate, etidronate,   YM-175,   clodronate,   pamidronate,   and   BM-210995   (ibandronate). According to their potency, oral daily dosage levels of the bisphosphonate of between 0.1   mg  and  5 g  and daily dosage levels of the growth  hormone secretagogues of this invention of between 0.01 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of body weight are administered to patients to obtain effective treatment of osteoporosis.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be combined with a mammalian estrogen agonist/antagonist. Any estrogen agonist/antagonist may be used as the second compound of this invention. The term estrogen agonist/antagonist refers to compounds which bind with the estrogen receptor, inhibit bone turnover and prevent bone loss. In particular, estrogen agonists are herein defined as chemical compounds<br><br>
capable of binding to the estrogen receptor sites in mammalian tissue, and mimicking<br>
the actions of estrogen in one or more tissue. Estrogen antagonists are herein defined<br>
as chemical compounds capable of binding to the estrogen receptor sites in<br>
mammalian tissue, and blocking the actions of estrogen in one or more tissues. Such<br>
activities are readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard<br>
assays including estrogen receptor binding assays, standard bone histomorphometric<br>
and densitometer methods (see Eriksen E.F. et al.. Bone Histomorphometry, Raven<br>
Press, New York, 1994, pages 1-74; Grier S.J. et. al., The Use of Dual-Energy X-Ray<br>
Absorptiometry In Animals,   Inv.   Radio).,   1996,   31(1):50-62;  Wahner  H.W.  and<br>

Compounds that have the ability to stimulate GH secretion from cultured rat pituitary cells are identified using the following protocol. This test is also useful for comparison to standards to determine dosage levels. Cells are isolated from pituitaries of 6-week old male Wistar rats. Following decapitation, the anterior pituitary lobes are removed into cold, sterile Hank's balanced salt solution without calcium or magnesium (HBSS). Tissues are finely minced, then subjected to two cycles of mechanically assisted enzymatic dispersion using 10 U/mL bacterial protease (EC 3.4.24.4, Sigma P-6141) in HBSS. The tissue-enzyme mixture is stirred in a spinner flask at 30 rpm in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at about 37°C for about 30 min, with manual trituration after about 15 min and about 30 min using a 10-mL<br>
pipet. This mixture is centrifuged at 200 x g for about 5 min. Horse serum is added to the supernatant to neutralize excess protease. The pellet is resuspended in fresh protease, stirred for about 30 min more under the previous conditions, and manually triturated, ultimately through a 23-gauge needle. Again, horse serum is added, then the cells from both digests are combined, pelleted (200 x g for about 15 min), washed, resuspended in culture medium and counted. Cells are plated at 6.0-<br>
6.5x104 cells per cm2 in 48-well Costar dishes and cultured for 3-4 days in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (0-MEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose, 10% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/mL nystatin and 50 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate before assaying for GH secretion.<br>
Just prior to assay, culture wells are rinsed twice, then equilibrated for about 30 minutes in release medium (D-MEM buffered with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 and containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 37°C). Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO, then diluted into pre-warmed release medium. Assays are run in quadruplicate. The assay is initiated by adding 0.5 ml of release medium (with vehicle or test compound) to each culture well. Incubation is carried out at about 37°C for about 15 minutes, then terminated by removal of the culture medium, which is centrifuged at 2000 x g for about 15 minutes to remove cellular material. Rat growth hormone concentrations in the supematants are determined by a standard radioimmunoassay protocol using a rat growth hormone reference preparation (NIDDK-rGH-RP-2) and rat growth hormone antiserum raised in monkey (NIDDK-anti-rGH-S-5) obtained from Dr. A. Pariow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrence, CA). Additional rat growth hormone (1.5U/mg, #G2414, Scripps Labs, San Diego, CA) is iodinated to a specific activity of approximately 30 uCi/ug by the chloramine T method for use as tracer. Immune complexes are obtained by adding goat antiserum to monkey IgG (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) plus polyethylene glycol, MW 10,000-20,000 to a final concentration of 4.3%; recovery is accomplished by centrifugation. This assay has a working range of 0.08-2.5 ug rat growth hormone per tube above basal levels. Active compounds typically stimulate growth hormone release by greater than 1.4 fold.

Assay for Exogenouslv-Stimulated Growth Hormone Release in the Rat after Intravenous Administration of Test Compounds<br>
Twenty-one day old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) are allowed to acclimate to local vivarium conditions (24 °C, 12 hr light. 12 hr dark cycle) for approximately 1 week before compound testing. All rats are allowed access to water and a pelleted commercial diet (Agway Country Food, Syracuse NY) ad libitum. The experiments are conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.<br>
On the day of the experiment, test compounds are dissolved in vehicle containing 1% ethanol, 1mM acetic acid and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline. Each compound is tested with n=3. Rats are weighed and anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutol, 50 mg/kg body weight). Fourteen minutes after anesthetic administration, a blood sample is taken by nicking the tip of the tail and allowing the blood to drip into a microcentrifuge tube (baseline blood sample, approximately 100 µl). Fifteen minutes after anesthetic administration, test compound is delivered by intravenous injection into the tail vein, with a total injection volume of 1 ml/kg body weight. Additional blood samples are taken from the tail at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after compound administration. Blood samples are kept on ice until serum separation by centrifugation (1430xg for 10 minutes at 10°C). Serum is stored at -80°C until serum growth hormone determination by radio-immunoassay as described above and below. Assessment of Exoaenouslv-Stimulated Growth Hormone Release in the Dog  Qral Administration<br>
On the day of experimentation, the test compound is weighed out for the appropriate dose and dissolved in water. Doses are delivered at a volume of 0.5 ml/kg by gavage to 4 dogs for each dosing regimen. Blood samples (2 ml) are collected from the jugular vein by direct vena puncture pre-dose and at 0.08, 0.17, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post dose using 2 ml vacutainers containing lithium heparin. The prepared plasma is stored at -20 °C until analysis. Measurement of Canine Growth Hormone<br>
Canine    growth    hormone    concentrations    are    determined    by    a    standard radioimmunoassay protocol using canine growth hormone (antigen for iodination and<br>
reference preparation AFP-1983B) and canine growth hormone antiserum raised in monkey (AFP-21452578) obtained from Dr. A.  Partow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrence, CA).   Tracer is produced by chloramine T-iodination of canine growth hormone to a specific activity of 20-40 pCi/µg.    Immune complexes are obtained by adding goat antiserum to monkey IgG (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) plus polyethylene glycol, MW 10,000-20,000 to a final concentration of 4.3%; recovery is accomplished by centrifugation. This assay has a working range of 0.08-2.5 µg canine GH/tube.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration and can be formulated with phamnaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, the elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.<br>
Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and com oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing<br>
agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca butter or a suppository wax.<br>
Compositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.<br>
The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied; however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg of body weight daily are administered to humans and other animals, e.g., mammals, to obtain effective release of growth hormone.<br>
A preferred dosage range is 0.01 to 5.0 mg/kg of body weight daily which can be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.<br>
The preparation of the compounds of Formula I of the present invention can be earned out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes. Syntheses detailing the preparation of the compounds of Formula I in a sequential manner are presented in the reaction schemes shown hereinbelow.<br>
Many protected amino acid derivatives are commercially available, where the protecting groups Prt, Z100 and Z200 are, for example, BOC, CBZ, benzyl, ethoxycarbonyl groups, CF3C(O)-, FMOC, TROC, trityl or tosyl. Other protected amino acid derivatives can be prepared by literature methods. Some 3-oxo-2-carboxyl pyrrolidines, and 4-oxo-3-carboxyl piperidines are commercially available, and many other related pyrrolidines and 4-substituted piperidines are known in the literature.<br>
Many of the schemes illustrated below describe compounds which contain protecting groups Prt, Z100 or Z200. Benzyloxycarbonyl groups can be removed by a number of methods including, catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium or platinum catalyst in a protic solvent such as methanol. Preferred<br>
catalysts are palladium hydroxide on carbon or palladium on carbon. Hydrogen pressures from 1-1000 psi may be employed; pressures from 10 to 70 psi are preferred. Alternatively, the benzyloxycarbonyl group can be removed by transfer hydrogenation.<br>
Removal of BOC protecting groups can be carried out using a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid with or without the presence of a cosolvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, ether or methanol at a temperature of about -30 to 70°C, preferably about -5 to about 35°C.<br>
Benzyl esters of amines can be removed by a number of methods including, catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst in a protic solvent such as methanol. Hydrogen pressures from 1-1000 psi may be employed; pressures from 10 to 70 psi are preferred. The addition and removal of these and other protecting groups are discussed by T. Greene in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981.<br>

SCHEME 1: The protected amino acid derivatives 1 are in many cases commercially available, where the protecting group Prt is, for example, BOC, FMOC or CBZ groups. Other amino acids can be prepared by literature methods.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 1, coupling of amines of formula 2 with protected amino acids of formula 1, where Prt is a suitable protecting group, is conveniently carried out in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or DMF by a coupling reagent such as EDC or DCC in the presence of HOBT or HOAT. In the case where the amine is present as the hydrochloride salt, it is preferable to add one or two equivalents of a suitable base such as triethylamine to the reaction mixture.<br>
Alternatively, the coupling can be effected with a coupling reagent such as BOP in an inert solvent such as methanol. Such coupling reactions are generally conducted at temperatures of about -30° to about 80°C, preferably -10° to about 258C. For a discussion of other conditions used for coupling peptides see Houben-Weyl, Vol. XV, part II, E. Wunsch, Ed., George Theime Veriag, 1974, Stuttgart. Separation of unwanted side products and purification of intermediates is achieved by chromatography on silica gel, employing flash chromatography (W. C. Still, M. Kahn and A. Mrtra, J. Org. Chem. 43 2923 1978), by crystallization or by trituration.<br>

Intermediate  10 is generated by coupling 9 to amino acid 5.    The ester of intermediate 10 can be converted to intermediate acid 11 by a number of methods known in the art; for example, methyl and ethyl esters can be hydrolyzed with lithium hydroxide in a protic solvent such as aqueous methanol or aqueous THF at a temperature of about -20° to 120°C, preferably about 0° to 50°C.    In addition, removal of a benzyl group can be accomplished by a number of reductive methods including hydrogenation in the presence of platinum or palladium catalyst in a protic solvent such as methanol.    Acid 11 can then be coupled to amine 2 to give intermediates of formula 6. Transformation of 6 to 7 can be achieved by removal of the protecting group Z200.<br>

The following examples are provided for the purpose of further illustration only and are not intended to be limitations on the disclosed invention. General Experimental Procedures:<br>
Amicon silica 30 nM, 60 A pore size, was used for column chromatography. Melting points were taken on a Buchi 510 apparatus and are unconnected. Proton and carbon NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300, Bruker AC-300, Varian Unity 400 or Bruker AC-250 at 25 °C . Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million down field from trimethylsilane. Particle beam mass spectra were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5989A spectrometer using ammonia as the source of chemical ionization. For initial sample dissolution, chloroform or methanol was employed. Liquid secondary ion mass spectra (LSIMS) were obtained on a Kratos Concept-18 high resolution spectrometer using cesium ion bombardment on a sample dissolved in a 1:5 mixture of dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol or in a thioglycerol matrix. For initial sample dissolution chloroform or methanol was employed. Reported data are sums of 3-20 scans calibrated against cesium iodide. TLC analyses were performed using E. Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 silica plates visualized (after elution with the indicated solvent(s)) by staining with 15% ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid and heating on a hot plate.<br>
General Procedure A (Peptide coupling using EDC): A 0.2-0.5 M solution of the primary amine (1.0 equivalent) in dichloromethane (or a primary amine hydrochloride and 1.0-1.3 equivalents of triethylamine) is treated sequentially with 1.0-1.2 equivalents of the carboxylic acid coupling partner, 1.5-1.8 equivalents hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT) or HOAT and 1.0-1.2 equivalents (stoichiometrically equivalent to the quantity of carboxylic acid) 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and the mixture is stirred overnight in an ice bath (the ice bath is allowed to warm, thus the reaction mixture is typically held at about 0-20 °C for about 4-6 h and about 20-25 °C for the remaining period). The mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate or other solvent as specified, and the resulting mixture washed twice with 1N NaOH, twice with 1N HCI (if the product is not basic), once with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated giving the crude product which is purified as specified. The carboxylic acid component can be used as the dicyclohexylamine salt in coupling to the primary amine or hydrochloride of the latter; in this case no triethylamine is employed.<br>
