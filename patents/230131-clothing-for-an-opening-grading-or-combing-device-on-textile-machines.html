				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to clothing for an opening, grading or combing device on<br>
textile machines, such as a circular comb, top comb, card, spinning machine or<br>
the like, comprising a plurality of needles or serrated punched elements which<br>
perform a sliver opening, grading or combing motion.<br>
Textile opening, grading or combing devices of the generic type serve for<br>
paralleling a wool or cotton sliver and removing any impurities in the sliver.<br>
The quality of the final product is strongly influenced by the quality of this<br>
combing process, which is why numerous approaches exist for further<br>
improvement of the combing result.<br>
For improved paralleling, use is made in particular of the configuration of needles<br>
and serrated punched elements as such and of the relative positions and<br>
dimensions thereof.<br>
Another problem resides in that the combing devices considerably lose efficiency<br>
due to particles that are combed out and settle in the combing devices. For<br>
optimal paralleling it would be desirable as far as possible to increase the density<br>
of the needles and serrated punched elements, which will however add to the<br>
risk of particles and reducing the efficiency of the combing process.<br>
Numerous approaches have been made to remove deposited particles for<br>
combing devices, using in particular mechanical cleaners such as brushes or<br>
blades. They have the considerable drawback that wear of the needles and<br>
serrated punched elements is caused by the mechanical contact. Considerable<br>
improvement has been accomplished by the introduction of pneumatic cleaning,<br>
in particular of top combs.<br><br>
It is the object of the invention to embody a combing device of the type<br>
mentioned at the outset for further improved results, ensuring gentle penetration<br>
on the one hand and a good combing effect on the other, any deposit of the<br>
combed out particles in the combing device being avoided.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained in that the combing motion can<br>
be superimposed by a motion of the needles or serrated punched elements with<br>
at least one component that is perpendicular to the combing motion.<br>
A superimposed motion, in particular oscillatory motion, perpendicular to the<br>
direction of sliver motion and on a clothing level that is, on the level or surface<br>
formed by the tips of the needles and serrated punched elements, will<br>
considerably improve and smooth the behaviour of penetration of the combing<br>
device into the sliver and vice versa so that use can be made of greater density<br>
of tips and improved angles of penetration. Simultaneously, any oscillation in this<br>
direction will change the distance from each other of adjacent needles or<br>
serrated punched elements, releasing any particles that may be stuck.<br>
A superimposed motion, in particular oscillatory motion, in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the direction of sliver motion and perpendicular to the surface<br>
of the needles or tips of serrated punched elements, helps attain in particular a<br>
conveying motion towards the tips that is away from the bottom between<br>
adjacent needles or serrated punched elements, detachment and removal of any<br>
settled particles thus being improved.<br>
For gentle penetration into the sliver as well as removal of settled particles to be<br>
attained, two components of motion that are perpendicular to each other can be<br>
superimposed.<br><br>
By advantage, the superimposed motion of the needles or serrated punched<br>
elements is produced piezoelectrically, electromechanically or by an eccentric,<br>
actuation of which taking place by an electric motor or derived from the drive of<br>
the opening, grading or combing device.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a part of the needles or serrated punched elements<br>
is stationary and another is displaceable, performing the superimposed motion.<br>
The needles or serrated punched elements can be mounted for oscillation<br>
relative to the respective supporting body so that they can be incited to self-<br>
oscillation.<br>
In keeping with another embodiment, it is advantageously provided that the<br>
needles or serrated punched elements perform a motion in the way of an<br>
oscillating conveyor substantially in a direction towards the tip, which can be put<br>
into practice in particular by a reciprocating oscillatory motion being braked<br>
abruptly in the phase of motion toward the tip and gently in the opposite<br>
direction so that the particles are conveyed by their inertia in the direction<br>
toward the tip and consequently out of the working range of the clothing.<br>
Details of the invention will become apparent from the ensuing description of<br>
preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings,<br>
in which<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of a circular-comb clothing of serrated punched<br>
elements, the first segment, seen in the combing direction, being mounted for<br>
oscillation;<br><br>
Figure 2 is a view, corresponding to Figure 1, with the first two segments, seen<br>
in the combing direction, being mounted for oscillation;<br>
Figure 3 is a diagrammatic view of a top comb with a particle;<br>
Figure 4 is a view, corresponding to Figure 3, for illustration of the transverse<br>
oscillation;<br>
Figure 5 is a view, corresponding to Figure 3, for illustration of the outward<br>
oscillation;<br>
Figure 6 is a diagrammatic view of another embodiment in a position of cleaning;<br>
Figure 7 is a view of the embodiment of Figure 6 in the normal position;<br>
Figure 8 is a view of the superimposed oscillatory motions according to Figures 1<br>
and 2;<br>
Figure 9 is a view of a needle bearer;<br>
Figure 10 is a view of a needle bearer after the assembly of needles that are<br>
lined up thereon;<br>
Figure 11 is a view of another embodiment of a needle bar comprised of a<br>
needle bearer and lined up needles;<br>
Figure 12 is a view of a preferred embodiment of a needle bearer; and<br><br>
Figure 13 is a view of the needle bearer of Figure 11 prior to the needles being<br>
attached.<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically illustrates the clothing 1 of a circular comb (otherwise<br>
not shown), the clothing 1 consisting of a plurality of segments 2, 3, 4, 5. The<br>
circular comb rotates in the direction of the arrow 6, with the sliver 7 that is to<br>
be combed being illustrated by a corresponding referenced arrow.<br>
The first segment 5, seen in the direction of combing, that is the segment that<br>
will be the first to penetrate into the sliver 7, is mounted for oscillating actuation<br>
in directions perpendicular to the combing direction (corresponding to the arrows<br>
6 and 6', respectively), this meaning that the segment 5 is able to make an<br>
oscillating motion perpendicular to the plane of projection in the direction of the<br>
arrow 9 that is in the radial direction related to the center of rotation of the<br>
circular comb.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure 2, not only the first segment 5, seen in<br>
the direction of combing, but also the second segment 4 is drivable to oscillate in<br>
a corresponding manner as explained in conjunction with Figure 1.<br>
The oscillation that is produced is illustrated in Figure 8, with the X direction of<br>
oscillation corresponding to the direction of the arrow 8 and the Y direction of<br>
oscillation corresponding to the direction of the arrow 9, the super-position of<br>
these oscillating motions causing the tips 10 of the teeth 11 of each serrated<br>
punched element 12 of the segments 5 and 4 to perform an elliptic oscillation.<br><br>
The oscillations or components of oscillation in the direction of the arrow 8<br>
ensure gentle, smooth penetration, whereas the oscillation or components of<br>
oscillation in the direction of the arrow 9 ensure that any particles that may<br>
deposit are moved in a direction towards the tips 10 out of the clothing.<br>
Clothing, for example of a top comb 14, is seen in Figure 3, comprising needles<br>
13 where a particle 15 has settled. An oscillating motion in the direction of the<br>
arrow 16 that is in the longitudinal direction of the needles 13, detaches the<br>
particle 15 and transports it outwards.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates that as a result of an oscillating motion in the direction of the<br>
arrow 17, the needles 13 jointly oscillate crosswise of their longitudinal<br>
extension, which helps to implement gentle penetration into the sliver.<br>
While all the needles 13 of the clothing 14 oscillate jointly in the embodiment<br>
according to Figures 3 and 4, the embodiments of Figures 5 to 7 provide that a<br>
first part of needles 7a is stationary and a second part of needles 7b is movable<br>
in relation thereto in the direction of the arrows 18 that is in the longitudinal<br>
direction thereof.<br>
As opposed to the embodiment of Figure 5, the embodiment according to<br>
Figures 6 and 7 provides the movable needles 7b to have shoulders 19 so that<br>
upon elevation of the needles 7b in an outward direction, these shoulders 19 are<br>
also lifted and any particles that have settled there are reliably transported<br>
upwards. Figure 6 shows the elevated position of cleaning and Figure 7 the<br>
lowered normal position.<br><br>
The movability, provided according to the invention, of the serrated punched<br>
elements 12 and in particular of the needles 7 requires highly reliable attachment<br>
of the needles to the needle bearer. The fastening technique illustrated in<br>
Figures 9 to 13 can be used to advantage also in stationary clothing.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates a needle bearer 20 of a material that is free-flowing under<br>
pressure, in particular aluminum; the needle bearer 20 has a groove 21.<br>
As seen in Figure 10, needles 7c are inserted and lined up in this groove 21,<br>
having positive fit; then cold-flow material displacement is implemented by two<br>
rollers, forming the grooves 22 on the front 23 of the needle bearer 20, so that<br>
the head portion 24 of the needles 7c is fixed not only by positive fit, but also<br>
non-positively.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a finished needle bar 25; in this case the pressure rollers<br>
have acted laterally instead of frontally, forming grooves 26 and thus fixing the<br>
needle head 24.<br>
Figure 12 shows an embodiment of a needle bar corresponding to Figure 9 with<br>
a groove 21 of rectangular cross-sectional shape that is suitable for the fastening<br>
technique of Figure 11.<br>
An alternative embodiment is seen in Figure 13 where the groove 21a has a<br>
dove-tail cross-sectional shape so that lining up the head portions 24 of the<br>
needles 7c reliably prevents the needles 7c from dropping out downwards.<br><br>
