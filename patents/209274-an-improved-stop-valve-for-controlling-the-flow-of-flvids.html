				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the development of an improved stop valve for controlling the flow of fluids.<br>
The main use of the modified improved stop valve is to provide a device to prevent loss of fluid such as water due to removal/theft of tap/hydrant, especially in public water supply system.<br>
In the prior art of an improved stop valve useful for controlling the flow of fluids developed by us and filed as patent application No. 1509/DEL/94, the coil spring designated as part no. (8) has been dispensed with in the present invention. Instead, pressure of liquid within the pipeline has been utilized for keeping the valve in the open position for allowing the liquid to flow. Consequently, disadvantages associated with loss of spring tension due to long usage of the valve, as also rusting of the spring, are obviated in the present modification. Furthermore, the lever (7) of the improved stop valve in the abovesaid patent has also been dispensed with in the present invention. Instead, the external lever (7) has been replaced by a simple internal slot - and - projection arrangement for closing and opening operations of the valve. Thereby the valve has been made even lesser prone to wilful tampering by miscreants. Both the modifications described above have served to make the valve:<br>
(a)	simpler in construction<br>
(b)	reduced its cost of production, marginally<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a modified improved stop valve for controlling the flow of fluids which obviates the above detailed drawbacks.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a modified improved stop valve suitable for use in public water supply outlets and one that cannot be wilfully tampered with by any user.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a modified improved stop valve of simpler construction and greater durability than the earlier mentioned improved stop valve.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification, the individual parts as also views of<br>
the modified improved stop valve in 'closed' and 'open1 positions, and the general<br>
arrangement of the valve when enclosed within a cement concrete pillar as used in<br>
public water supply systems, are shown as described below-<br>
Fig. 1(a), and (b): Two views of the valve in 'closed' position<br>
Fig.  2(a), and (b) : Two views of the valve in cement concrete pillar with the entire<br>
valve covered, except for the outer sliding collar.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved stop valve useful or controlling the flow of fluids characterized in that comprising a hollow adapter (1) provided with external threads (1a) at its upper end, an inverted L-shaped slot (1b) being provided towards the lower end of the said adapter (1), a barrel and nipple (2) being housed in the said hollow adapter and provided with a blind flange with a collar (2a), the said barrel nipple also being provided with a plurality of holes (2b) below the blind flange, two holes (2c) being provided diametrically opposite each other on the wall of barrel nipple (2) towards its lower end such that pins ( 3a &amp; 3b) fixed on the inner wall of an outer sliding part (3) can be fixed on the holes (2c) of the said barrel nipple to either lift or lower the said barrel nipple as and when required for opening or closing of the valve.<br>
In a preferred arrangement of the present invention, the bottom portion of the barrel nipple could be externally threaded towards its lower end to enable the fixing of a suitable hose or other outlet device for the exit of liquid.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the outer hollow adapter (1) can be suitably lengthened and provided with integral flanged extensions ( 1d &amp; 1e) at both its upper and lower ends in order to enable the valve assembly, excluding the outer sliding collar, to be embedded within concrete grouting as indicated in Fig. 4 so as to make the entire valve assembly completely tamper-proof.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1 which shows the valve in the 'closed' position, the pins (3a &amp; 3b) attached to the outer sliding collar (3) and hence the barrel nipple (2), are resting at the lowermost end of the inverted L-shaped slot(lb), thereby the collar (2a) of the barrel nipple (2) is sitting on the seat (Ic) of the adapter (1) and blocking the passage of liquid through the barrel nipple. For opening the valve, the sliding collar (3) alongwith the barrel nipple is pushed upward and twisted slightly so that the pins (3a &amp; 3b) rest on the horizontal step of the slot (Ib) at the uppermost end so as to allow the incoming fluid to enter through the circumferential holes (2b) of the barrel nipple and flow out through the other end. For closing the valve, the sliding collar is twisted slightly in the direction opposite to that required to open it in order to allow the barrel valve to fall to the original position on account of the action of the pressure of the flowing liquid.<br>
The valve is attached to the fluid line at the external threads (la) of the adapter (1) for controlling the flow of fluids. For opening the valve in order to allow the fluid to pass through the device, the outer sliding collar (3) is pushed upwards and twisted slightly so as to allow the pins (3a &amp; 3b) attached to it, and hence the barrel nipple (2), to rest on the horizontal step of the inverted L-shaped slot (Ib). Consequently, the incoming fluid enters through the circumferential holes (2b) of the barrel nipple and flows out through the other end. For closing the valve, the sliding collar is slightly twisted in the opposite direction to allow it to fall to the original position due to action of the fluid pressure within the pipeline acting on the blind flange (2a) of the barrel nipple. The holes in the closed position are then housed inside the adapter thereby effectively blocking the passage of fluid through the barrel nipple.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An  improved  stop  valve  useful  or controlling  the flow  of fluids<br>
characterized in that  comprising   a hollow adapter (1) provided with<br>
external threads (1a) at its upper end, an inverted L-shaped slot (1b)<br>
being provided towards the lower end of the said adapter (1), a barrel<br>
and nipple (2) being housed in the said hollow adapter and provided<br>
with a blind flange with a collar (2a), the said barrel nipple also being<br>
provided with a plurality of holes (2b) below the blind flange, two holes<br>
(2c) being provided diametrically opposite each other on the wall of<br>
barrel nipple (2) towards its lower end such that pins ( 3a &amp; 3b) fixed<br>
on the inner wall of an outer sliding part (3) can be fixed on the holes<br>
(2c) of the said barrel nipple to either lift or lower the said barrel nipple<br>
as and when required for opening or closing of the valve.<br>
2.	An  improved  stop valve  useful for controlling the flow of fluids<br>
substantially as herein described with reference to figures 1,2,3 &amp; 4 of<br>
the drawing accompanying this specification.<br></td>
