These systems can be either homogeneous catalyst systems or supported catalysts. More details on the possible catalyst systems can be found, for example, in EP-A-563,917, EP-A-578,838, US-A-4,659,685, US-A-5,240,894 and WO-A-92/333.<br>

The reaction of the compounds of the formula (B) with a salt of an anion [LQm]q" and the anion exchange conversion of compounds of the formula (A) are expediently carried out in an aqueous or aqueous alcoholic medium, for example in mixtures of water and methanol or ethanol. The salts of the anions [LQm]q" are employed at least in stoichiometric amounts but preferably in excess.<br>
For the polymerization, it is additionally possible to use a metallocene catalyst consisting of two principal components (A-1 and A-2).<br>
Of these, component A-1 is a metallocene compound. It is possible in principle to employ any metallocene regardless of its structure and composition. The metallocenes can be either bridged or unbridged, and can have identical or different ligands. The compounds involved are those of the metals of groups IVb, Vb or Vlb of the Periodic Table, for example compounds of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, preferably of zirconium, hafnium and titanium, especially zirconium.<br>

In the preparation of the catalyst, chiral metallocenes are preferably employed as a racemate. However, it is also possible to use the pure R or S form. Using these pure stereoisomeric forms, optically active polymer can be prepared. However, the meso form of the metallocenes should be separated off, since the polymerization-active centre (the metal atom) in these compounds is no longer chiral, owing to mirror symmetry at the central metal, and is therefore unable to produce highly tactic polymer. If the meso form is not separated off, atactic polymer is produced in addition to isotactic or syndiotactic polymers. For certain applications, for example flexible mouldings, or for the preparation of polyethylene grades, this may be entirely desirable. The stereoisomers are separated by methods known from the literature.<br><br><br>
for the cyclic type, in which formulae (3) and (4) the radicals R can be identical or different and are a CrCealkyl group, a C6-C18aryl group, benzyl or hydrogen, and p is an integer from 2 to 50, preferably from 10 to 35.<br>
The radicals R are preferably identical and are methyl, isobutyl, n-butyl, phenyl or benzyl, particularly preferably methyl.<br>
Where the radicals R are different, they are preferably methyl and hydrogen, methyl and isobutyl or methyl and n-butyl, with the content of hydrogen or isobutyl or n-butyl preferably being 0.01-40 % (number of radicals R).<br>
The aluminoxane can be prepared by known methods in various ways. One of the methods, for example, is the reaction of an aluminium hydrocarbon compound and/or a hydridoaluminium-hydrocarbon compound with water (in gaseous, solid or liquid form or else in bound form, for example as water of crystallization) in an inert solvent (for example toluene). To prepare an aluminoxane with different alkyl groups R, two different aluminium trialkyls (AIR3 + AIR"3), in accordance with the desired composition and reactivity, are reacted with water (cf. S. Pasynkiewicz, Polyhedron 9 (1990) 429 and EP-A-302,424).<br>
The precise structure of the aluminoxanes of the formulae (3) and (4) is unknown.<br>
Regardless of the manner of their preparation, all aluminoxane solutions share the feature of a varying content of unreacted aluminium starting compound, which is present in free form or as an adduct.<br>
b) Ion exchange compounds<br>
Ion exchange compounds are compounds comprising a cation, which reacts irreversibly with a ligand of component A-1, and a noncoordinating anion, which is bulky, labile and chemically inert. Combining components A-1 and A-2 produces an ion pair formed from the cation of A-2 and a ligand of A-1. Examples of cations of component A-2 are Bransted acids, such as ammonium ions, or reducible Lewis acids, such as Ag+ or ferrocene ions.<br>
The aluminoxane which can be used as component A-2 can also be produced in the course of the preparation of a supported catalyst from trimethylaluminium.<br><br>
In addition to homogeneous catalyst systems, the metallocenes can also be used as heterogeneous catalysts. In this case the catalyst is applied to an inorganic or organic carrier by methods known to the person skilled in the art from the literature. Inorganic carrier materials are preferably silica gels; further details on this can be found, for example, in US-A-5,240,894.<br>
Examples of organic carrier materials are microporous polymeric carriers which are obtainable commercially (e.g. the ®Accurel grades from AKZO, such as ®Accurel-PE, ®Accurel-PP, ®Accurel-PA-6 or ®Accurel-PA-12 with a voids content of about 75 % by volume). The pore size of the ®Accurel materials is 0.5-5 \im (PP), 1.0-5 |xm (HDPE), or 0.5-3^m(PA-6andPA-12).<br>
The microporous polymeric carrier is advantageously dried beforehand, for example by treatment with aluminium alkyl solutions, then washed and rendered inert under a protective gas.<br>
The preferred procedure for this is first to react the aluminoxane in an appropriate solvent, for example pentane, hexane, heptane, toluene or dichloromethane, with at least one metallocene, by intensive mixing, for example by stirring. The reaction temperature is preferably from -20 to +120°C, in particular 15-40°C. The molar ratio of aluminium to transition metal M of the metallocene is preferably between 10:1 and 10,000:1, in particular between 100:1 and 2000:1. The reaction time is in general between 5 and 120 minutes, preferably 10-30 minutes. The reaction is preferably operated with an aluminium concentration of more than 0.01 mol/litre, in particular more than 0.5 mol/litre. The reaction is carried out under inert conditions.<br>
In place of the aluminoxane it is also possible to use a mixture of an aluminoxane with a further aluminium alkyl compound, for example trimethyl-, triethyl- or triisobutylaluminium, for the described reaction with the metallocene.<br>
After the reaction has taken place it is possible, for example, to remove part of the solvent under vacuum or, following concentration, to replace the solvent by a different solvent. The solution thus prepared is reacted in a suitable manner with the microporous polymeric<br><br>
carrier. In this context, the carrier is added at least in an amount whose total pore volume is able to take up the solution from the previous reaction. The reaction referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph is preferably carried out at temperatures of between -20 and +20°C, in particular 15-40°C, by intense mixing, for example by stirring or treatment with ultrasound. Thorough homogenization should be accomplished. In this context, the exchange of the inert gas of the pore volume can be accelerated by brief evacuation, for example.<br>
In principle, the supported catalyst can also be prepared in a one-pot reaction, i.e. all three starting components are reacted with one another simultaneously in an appropriate solvent/suspension medium. In this context, the amount of the polymeric carrier should preferably be calculated such that it is able to take up the entire volume of liquid.<br>
The catalyst can be metered into the polymerization system in suspended form, in an inert suspension medium such as, for example, heptane, n-decane, hexane or diesel oil, or else in dry form, possibly after removal of the remaining solvent by a drying step carried out, for example, under vacuum.<br>
The catalyst can advantageously be prepolymerized in the gaseous phase, in the liquid monomer or in suspension in which case it is possible to omit the addition of a further organoaluminium compound.<br>
Polymerization with these catalysts can be carried out by known methods in liquid or gaseous phase. The liquid phase may, for example, be an aliphatic hydrocarbon or the liquid monomer itself. The metallocene catalysts can also be employed as a mixture with other types of catalyst, for example Ziegler or Phillips catalysts. At the end of the polymerization the catalyst is destroyed, for example by adding water (vapour), wet nitrogen, carbon dioxide or alcohol.<br>
Metallocene polyolefins are further described in "New Trends in Polyolefin Catalysts and Influence on Polymer Stability" (Rolf Mulhaupt; the Twelfth Annual International Conference on Advances in the Stabilization and Controlled Degradation of Polymers, held in Luzern, Switzerland, 21-23 May 1990, pages 181 to 196 of the conference papers).<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the polyolefin prepared by polymerization over a metallocene catalyst is polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a composition which additionally contains a polyolefin not prepared by polymerization over a metallocene catalyst.<br>
Such polyolefins are for example prepared<br>
a)	by radical polymerization (normally under high pressure and at elevated<br>
temperature); or<br>
b)	by catalytic polymerization over a Phillips<br>
or Ziegler (-Natta) catalyst.<br>
Low density polyethylene (LDPE; prepared by radical polymerization), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE; prepared by catalytic polymerization over a Ziegler (-Natta) catalyst) and high density polyethylene (HDPE; prepared by catalytic polymerization over a Phillips catalyst) are particularly preferred.<br>
The weight ratio between the polyolefin prepared by polymerization over a metallocene catalyst to the polyolefin not prepared by polymerization over a metallocene catalyst is for example 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
A further embodiment of this invention is a method for stabilizing a polyolefin prepared by polymerization over a metallocene catalyst, which comprises incorporating into said polyolefin a stabilizer mixture as defined above.<br>
The two components of the stabilizer mixture can be used in various proportions depending on the nature of the polyolefin to be stabilized, on the end use and on the presence of other additives.<br>
In general, it is appropriate to use, for example, 0.01 to 5 % by weight of each of the two components of the stabilizer mixture, relative to the weight of the polyolefin to be stabilized, preferably 0.01 to 2 %, in particular 0.025 to 1 %.<br><br>
The stabilizer mixture or the individual components can be incorporated into the polyolefin by known methods, for example by dry mixing in the form of powder, or wet mixing in the form of solutions or suspensions or also in the form of a masterbatch which contains the individual components in a concentration of 2.5 to 25 % by weight; in such operations, the polyolefin can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, suspensions or eveVi in the form of latices.<br>
The stabilizer mixture or the individual components can be added before, during or after the polymerization or crosslinking. Furthermore, they can be incorporated in the polyolefin in the pure form or encapsulated in waxes, oils or polymers.<br>
Before incorporation, the individual components of the stabilizer mixture can also be mixed with one another in a melt or can be extruded with one another.<br>
The polyolefin stabilized with the stabilzer mixture can be used for the production of mouldings, films, tapes, monofilaments, fibres, surface coatings and the like.<br>
If desired, other conventional additives for polyolefins, such as antioxidants, UV absorbers, nickel stabilizers, pigments, fillers, plasticizers, corrosion inhibitors and metal deactivators, can be added to the polyolefin containing the stabilizer mixture described above.<br>
Examples of such conventional additives are listed in the following.<br>

The material thus obtained is compression molded in a laboratory press between two aluminum foils for 6 minutes at 170°C to a 0.2 mm thick film which is quenched immediately in cold water. Samples of 60 mm x 25 mm are cut out of these 0.2 mm films and are exposed in a ®WEATHER-OMETER Ci 65 (black panel temperature 63 ± 2°C, without water-spraying). Periodically, these samples are removed from the exposure apparatus and their carbonyl content is measured with an infrared spectrophotometer.<br>
The exposure time (T01) corresponding to the formation of a carbonyl absorbance of 0.1 is a measure for the stabilizing efficiency of the light stabilizer system. The values obtained are summarized in the following Tables 1 and 2.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2: Light stabilization of metallocene polypropylene films.<br>
100 parts of unstabilized metallocene polypropylene powder (melt flow index<br>
-20 g/10 minutes at 230°C and 2160 g) are homogenized at 200°C for 10 minutes in a<br>
Brabender plastograph with 0.05 parts of pentaerythrityl-tetrakis{3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl) propionate}, 0.1 part of tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite, 0.1 part of Ca<br><br>
stearate and the amount of the light stabilizer system indicated in Table 3. The material thus<br>
obtained is compression molded in a laboratory press between two aluminum foils for<br>
6 minutes at 260°C to a 0.5 mm thick film which is cooled immediately to room temperature<br>
in a water-cooled press. Samples of 60 mm x 25 mm are cut out of these 0.5 mm films and<br>
are exposed in a ®WEATHER-OMETER Ci 65 (black panel temperature 63 ± 2°C, without<br>
water-spraying).	"<br>
Periodically, these samples are removed from the exposure apparatus and their carbonyl content is measured with an infrared spectrophotometer.<br>
The exposure time (T02) corresponding to the formation of a carbonyl absorbance of 0.2 is a measure for the stabilizing efficiency of the light stabilizer system. The values obtained are summarized in the following Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
