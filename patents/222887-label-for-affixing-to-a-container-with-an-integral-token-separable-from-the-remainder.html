				<td>LABEL FOR AFFIXING TO A CONTAINER, WITH AN<br>
INTEGRAL TOKEN. SEPARABLE FROM THE REMAINDER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a label for affixing to a container, with an integral token,<br>
separable from the remainder.<br>
The invention has particular application to labels and labelling methods which<br>
include a frangible or severable portion.<br>
The invention is particularly suited for use in the wine industry.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is known for adhesive labels to be attached to wine bottles and the like.<br>
International patent Application PCT/AU02/01224, the contents of which are included<br>
herein by this reference, discloses such a wine label and the present invention relates to<br>
inventive improvements in the label disclosed therein.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention aims to provide an alternative to known labels and labelling<br>
methods.<br>
This invention in one aspect provides a label for affixing to a container, the label<br>
having:<br>
a front portion;<br>
an adhesive backing substantially covering one side of the front portion;<br>
a backing sheet with a non-stick surface removably affixed to the adhesive backing,<br>
and<br>
an integral token;<br>
an internal portion of the front portion constituting the integral token and being<br>
readily severable from the front portion via a closed line of perforations defining the<br>
perimeter of the integral token within the label, a portion of the backing sheet being<br>
removable from the adhesive backing such that another portion of the backing sheet remains<br>
attached to the integral token, said another portion not extending beyond the perforations<br>
which define the perimeter of the integral token.<br>
According to the invention there is provided an adhesive label ready for application<br>
to a container or the like and having an integral token, the adhesive label being provided<br>
with a closed line of perforations within the label to define an internal integral token which<br>
is separable from the remainder of the adhesive label, a portion of a backing sheet with a<br>
non-stick surface being provided under said integral token, said portion of backing sheet not<br>
extending beyond the closed line of perforations.<br>
The invention further provides a container or the like having an adhesive label<br>
applied thereto, the label having a closed line of perforations within the label to define an<br>
internal integral token which is separable from the remainder of the adhesive label, a portion<br>
of a backing sheet with a non-stick surface being provided under said integral token, said<br>
portion of backing sheet not extending beyond the closed line of perforations.<br>
The invention also provides a method of labelling a container, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a label for affixing to the container, the label having a front portion, an<br>
adhesive backing substantially covering one side of the front portion, a backing sheet with a<br>
non-stick surface removably affixed to the adhesive backing, and an integral token; an<br>
internal portion of the front portion constituting the integral token and being defined by a<br>
closed line of perforations within the label;<br>
removing a portion of the backing sheet from the adhesive backing such that another<br>
portion of the backing sheet remains attached to the integral token, said another portion not<br>
extending beyond the perforations which define the perimeter of the integral token, and<br>
affixing the label with the integral token to the container by the adhesive exposed<br>
when the portion of the backing sheet is removed therefrom;<br>
the integral token therafter being readily severable from the front portion via a<br>
rupturing of the closed line of perforations in order to separate the integral token from the<br>
affixed label.<br>
It is preferred that the token forms an edge portion extending around the other<br>
portion of the backing sheet remaining attached to the token.<br>
It is also preferred that the adhesive on the edge portion is stamped to render<br>
it less adhesive.<br>
In another aspect this invention resides broadly in a roll of labels as defined<br>
above for affixing to a container of produce.<br>
Description of the accompanying Drawings<br>
In order that this invention may be more easily understood and put into<br>
practical effect, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings which<br>
illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention, wherein:-<br>
FIG 1 is a perspective view of a label In accordance with the invention on a<br>
wine bottle;<br>
FIG 2 is a perspective view of the label of FIG 1 showing the token partially<br>
removed;<br>
FIG 3 is a cross-sectional elevation through the label of FIG 1 as seen along<br>
AA;<br>
FIG 4 is a perspective view of the rear of the label with the non-stick backing<br>
affixed:<br>
FIG 5 is a perspective view of the rear of the label with the non-stick backing<br>
removed;<br>
FIG 6 is a perspective view of the front of the label with the token intact, and<br>
FIG 7 is a perspective view of the front of the label with the token removed.<br>
Description of Preferred Embodiment of Invention<br>
As can be seen in FIG 1, a wine label 10 is affixed to a bottle 12 and has a<br>
tear-out token 14 which can be readily removed for collection or future reference by<br>
peeling back a tab 15, as best seen in FIG 2.<br>
FIG 3 is a cross-sectional elevation through the label along line AA seen in<br>
FIG 1 and illustrates the composition of label 10 as including a front portion 16 for<br>
carrying labelling indicia and an adhesive backing 18. Front portion 16 has a token<br>
14 for identifying the wine and as seen in FIG 2, is readily severable from the front<br>
portion 16 when the label 10 is affixed to the bottle.<br>
Label 10 also includes a non-stick backing sheet 17,19 affixed to adhesive<br>
backing 18. The backing sheet has a paper or paper-like substrate 17 and a non-<br>
stick layer 19 in known manner. Perforations 20 in front portion 16 facilitate the<br>
severing of token 14 from the front portion. Perforations 20 do not extend into the<br>
backing sheet 17 affixed to adhesive backing 18 by non-stick layer 19.<br>
Backing sheet 17 is cut through at 21 internally of perforations 20, such that a<br>
portion 22, of backing sheet 17 remains attached to token 14 when the remainder 24<br>
of backing sheet 17 is removed from adhesive backing 18 for affixing label 10 to<br>
bottle 12. Cut 21 is within the perforation 20 so that a thin strip 25 of adhesive<br>
remains affixed to the underside of the edge of token 14.<br>
The adhesive on strip 25 is of lesser adhesiveness than the remainder of .<br>
adhesive backing 18. In practice the adhesive on strip 25 is deadened by stamping<br>
this strip with a suitably shaped stamp or die, whereby the adhesiveness of this<br>
portion 25 of adhesive backing 18 is reduced.<br>
In use, as best seen in FIGS 4 - 7, a wine or other produce in a container is<br>
labelled in accordance with the present Invention with a label 10 having a front portion<br>
16 for carrying labelling indicia and having a token 14 for identifying the wine, an<br>
adhesive backing 18, and a non-stick backing sheet 17 affixed to adhesive backing<br>
18. As seen in FIG 5, portion 24 of backing sheet 17 is removed from adhesive<br>
backing 18 such that another portion 22 of backing sheet 17 remains attached to<br>
token 14. Label 10 is affixed to the bottle by the adhesive backing 18 exposed when<br>
portion 24 of backing sheet 17 is removed. As seen In FIGS 6 and 7, token 14 is<br>
readily severable from front portion 16 when label 10 is affixed to the bottle, leaving<br>
portion 23 of label 10 remaining affixed to the bottle.<br>
It will be appreciated that the edge portion 25 of reduced adhesiveness is<br>
attached to the container less aggressively than the remainder of label 10, thereby<br>
facilitating the removal of token 14 together with the backing sheet portion 22.<br>
It will of course be realised that whilst the above has been given by way of an<br>
illustrative example of this invention, all such and other modifications and variations<br>
hereto, as would be apparent to persons skilled in the art, are deemed to fall within<br>
the broad scope and ambit of this invention as is herein set forth.<br>
