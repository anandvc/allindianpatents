Pyridone-methide azo dyestuffs<br>
The invention relates to pyridone-methide azo dyestuffs, processes for their preparation, their use and coupling components containing pyridone-methide.<br>
Azo dyestuffs which contain a coupling component based on methylene-triazolo-pyridines are already known from DE-A 4 020 768 and DE-A 4 C39 296. However, these azo dyestuffs still have some disadvantages in their use. Thus, for example, their build-up capacity and their stability in the dyebath when used for dyeing polyester is not satisfactory.<br>
Pyridone-methide azo dyestuffs have now been found, which, in the form of the free acid, correspond to the formula (I) or its tautomeric forms<br>

A mixture of 37.4 g of 2,6-dichloropyridine and 47.5 ml of dimethyl sulphate was stirred at 100°C for 24 hours. After cooling, it was diluted with 75 ml of di-methylformamide, and a solution of 16.5 g of malononitrile in 25 ml of dimethyl-formamide and then 86.6 ml of triethylamine were added dropwise, while cooling with ice. The mixture was subsequently stirred for 20 hours and 14.7 g of a yellow product of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
were then filtered off with suction. A further 4 g were to be obtained by dilution of the filtrate with ice-water and acidification to pH = 1.<br>
MS (CI), m/z (%): 194 (35), 192 (100) [M+], 158 (C3)<br>
76.6 g of [l-methyl-6-chloro-2(l)-pyridinylidene]malononitrile were stirred in 400 ml of water and 400 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone at 80°C for 10 hours and at 90°C for 5 hours, pH = 10 being maintained by dropwise addition of 30% strength sodium hydroxide solution via a titrator. The mixture was topped up to a volume of 1200 ml with water and brought to pH = 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the product was filtered off with suction and washed with water. Yield: 63.5 g.<br>
MS, m/z (%): 173 (100) [M+], 146 (25), 145 (37), 144 (37), 130 (14), 119 (25), 118 (33), 108 (45), 39 (58).<br>

Preparation of a coupler<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
15.7 g of benzenesulphonamide were added to a solution of 5.4 g of sodium meth-ylate in 120 ml of methanol and the mixture was boiled under reflux for 2 hours, the benzenesulphonamide dissolving. The solution was concentrated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 75 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone and a solution of 19.2 g of [l-methyl-6-chloro-2(lH)-pyridinylidene]malononitrile (see Example 129) in 75 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone was allowed to run in. After 20 hours at room temperature, a further 2.7 g of sodium methylate and 3.9 g of benzenesulphonamide were added and the mixture was heated at 50°C for 5 hours and stirred at room temperature for 60 hours. It was diluted with 600 ml of ice-water and brought to pH = 1 with hydrochloric acid, and the product was filtered with suction and washed with water.  Yield 15 g.<br>

xample 152<br>
10 g of polyester fabric are introduced at a temperature of 60°C into 200 ml of a dye liquor which comprises 0.3% of the finely dispersed dyestuff of Example No. 134, based on the polyester fabric, and in which the pH is adjusted to 4.5 by means of acetic acid. The fabric is treated at 60°C for 5 minutes, the temperature of the liquor is then increased to 135°C in the course of 30 minutes and kept at this temperature for 60 minutes, and the liquor is then allowed to cool to 60°C in the course of 20 minutes.<br>
Thereafter, the dyed polyester fabric is purified reductively by being treated at 65°C for 15 minutes in 200 ml of a liquor which comprises 5 ml/1 of C3% strength by weight sodium hydroxide solution, 3 g/1 of sodium dithionite and 1 g/l of an addition product of 48 ml of ethylene oxide on 1 mol of castor oil.   Finally,<br>
the fabric is rinsed, neutralized with dilute acetic acid, rinsed again and dried.   A brilliant orange dyeing with good fastness properties is obtained.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
