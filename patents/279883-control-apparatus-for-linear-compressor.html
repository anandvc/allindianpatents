				<td>Description<br>
CONTROL APPARATUS FOR LINEAR COMPRESSOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a linear compressor, and more particularly, to a<br>
control apparatus for a linear compressor which can vary a cooling force and prevent<br>
an inrush current.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	 In general, a compressor is a mechanical apparatus for raising a pressure, by<br>
receiving power from a power generation apparatus such as an electric motor or<br>
turbine, and compressing the air, refrigerants or other various operation gases. The<br>
compressor has been widely used for an electric home appliance such as a refrigerator<br>
and an air conditioner, or in the whole industry.<br>
[3]	The compressors are roughly classified into a reciprocating compressor in which a<br>
compression space for sucking or discharging an operation gas is formed between a<br>
piston and a cylinder, and the piston is linearly reciprocated inside the cylinder, for<br>
compressing refrigerants, a rotary compressor in which a compression space for<br>
sucking or discharging an operation gas is formed between an eccentrically-rotated<br>
roller and a cylinder, and the roller is eccentrically rotated along the inner wall of the<br>
cylinder, for compressing refrigerants, and a scroll compressor in which a compression<br>
space for sucking or discharging an operation gas is formed between an orbiting scroll<br>
and a fixed scroll, and the orbiting scroll is rotated along the fixed scroll, for<br>
compressing refrigerants.<br>
[4]	Normally, the linear compressor sucks, compresses and discharges the refrigerants<br>
by using a linear driving force of a motor, and is divided into a compression unit<br>
including a cylinder and a piston for compressing the refrigerant gas, and a driving unit<br>
including a linear motor for supplying the driving force to the compression unit.<br>
[5]	In detail, in the linear compressor, the cylinder is fixedly installed in a hermetic<br>
container, and the piston is linearly reciprocated in the cylinder. As the piston is<br>
linearly reciprocated inside the cylinder, the refrigerants are supplied into a<br>
compression space in the cylinder, compressed and discharged. A suction valve<br>
assembly and a discharge valve assembly are installed in the compression space, for<br>
controlling suction and discharge of the refrigerants according to an inner pressure of<br>
the compression space.<br>
[6]	The linear motor for generating the linear driving force is connected to the piston.<br>
 <br>
In the linear motor, an inner statox and an outer stator formed by laminating a plurality<br>
of laminations in the circumferential direction are installed around the cylinder with a<br>
predetermined gap, a coil (or coil winding body) is wound around the inner stator or<br>
the inner portion of the outer stator, and a permanent magnet is installed in the gap<br>
between the inner stator and the outer stator and connected to the piston.<br>
[7]	The permanent magnet is movable in the motion direction of the piston. The<br>
permanent magnet is linearly reciprocated in the motion direction of the piston by an<br>
electromagnetic force generated when a current flows through the coil. The linear<br>
motor is operated at a constant operating frequency f , and the piston is linearly re-<br>
c<br>
ciprocated at a predetermined stroke S.<br>
[8]	Fig. 1 is a circuit view illustrating a conventional control apparatus for a linear<br>
compressor. Referring to Fig. 1, the control apparatus includes a coil winding body L<br>
wound in the circumferential direction of the linear compressor, for receiving power, a<br>
branch means 100 for applying power to the part or whole of the coil winding body L,<br>
and a control unit 200 for controlling the branch means 100 to control a cooling force<br>
according to a load.<br>
[9]	In detail, a power supply source is connected to one end of the coil winding body L,<br>
and a connection terminal 100a of the branch means 100 is formed at the other end of<br>
the coil winding body L. A connection terminal 100b is connected to a middle point M<br>
(or a branch line of the middle point L) of the coil winding body L. The branch means<br>
100 includes a switching element 100c for applying power to the connection terminal<br>
100a or 100b by the control of the control unit 200.<br>
[10]	The control unit 200 performs a power mode of applying power to the part of the<br>
coil winding body L in order to output a high cooling force in an overload of a freezing<br>
cycle, and performs a saving mode of applying power to the whole coil winding body<br>
L in order to output a low cooling force or a middle cooling force in a low load or mid<br>
load of the freezing cycle. For the power mode, the control unit 200 connects the<br>
switching element 100c of the branch means 100 to the connection terminal 100b. For<br>
the saving mode, the control unit 200 connects the switching element 100c of the<br>
branch means 100 to the connection terminal 100a.<br>
[11]	In the above-described linear compressor, the linear motor is operated, in a load<br>
considered in the design, at an operating frequency f identical to a natural frequency f<br>
c	n<br>
of the piston computed by using a mechanical spring constant K of a coil spring and a<br>
m<br>
gas spring constant K of a gas spring. Accordingly, the linear motor is operated in the<br>
g<br>
power mode only in the load considered in the design to improve efficiency.<br>
 <br>
[12]	Since the load is actually variable, the gas spring constant K of the gas spring and<br>
g<br>
the natural frequency f of the piston computed by using the same are changed.<br>
n<br>
[13]	In detail, in the design, the operating frequency f of the linear motor is set to be<br>
c<br>
equalized to the natural frequency f of the piston in the mid load region. Even if the<br>
n<br>
load is varied, the linear motor is operated at the constant operating frequency f .<br>
c<br>
However, the natural frequency f of the piston increases with the increase of the load.<br>
[14]	Formula 1<br>
[15]<br>
 <br>
[16]	Here, f represents the natural frequency of the piston, K and K represent the<br>
n	m	g<br>
mechanical spring constant and the gas spring constant, respectively, and M represents<br>
the mass of the piston.<br>
[17]	In the design, since the ratio of the gas spring constant K in the total spring<br>
g<br>
constant K is small, the gas spring constant K is not considered or is set to have a<br>
constant value. In addition, the mass M of the piston and the mechanical spring<br>
constant K have constant values. Therefore, the natural frequency f of the piston is<br>
m	n<br>
computed as a constant value by the above formula 1.<br>
[18]	Actually, as the load increases, the pressure and temperature of the refrigerants<br>
increase in the limited space. As a result, the gas spring constant K increases due to<br>
g<br>
the increase of an elastic force of the gas spring itself, and the natural frequency f of<br>
n<br>
the piston proportional to the gas spring constant K also increases.<br>
g<br>
[19]	In the conventional art, in the case that the control unit 200 controls the switching<br>
element 100c, an electric energy accumulated in the coil winding body L is operated to<br>
generate an inrush current.<br>
[20]	If the applied power is varied, such variation changes the output of the linear<br>
compressor regardless of the control of the control unit 200. If the power is excessively<br>
applied, the linear compressor undergoes an overload or performs an abnormal<br>
operation. That is, the linear compressor is not normally operated.<br>
[21]	The conventional control apparatus for the linear compressor as shown in Fig. 1<br>
controls the operating frequency f without considering the natural frequency f of the<br>
c	n<br>
piston or movable member varied according to the gas spring constant K . Even though<br>
g<br>
the output of the linear compressor can be varied according to the cooling force of the<br>
load, the resonant frequency of the linear compressor is not kept. As a result,<br>
 <br>
efficiency of the linear compressor decreases. Moreover, the efficiency and cooling<br>
force of the linear compressor are considerably changed due to variation of the<br>
externally-applied power. It is a fatal problem in the operation of the linear<br>
compressor.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[49]	A control apparatus for a linear compressor in accordance with the preferred em-<br>
bodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
[50]	As illustrated in Fig. 2, in the linear compressor, an inflow tube 2a and an outflow<br>
 <br>
tube 2b for sucking and discharging refrigerants are installed at one side of a hermetic<br>
container 2, a cylinder 4 is fixedly installed in the hermetic container 2, a piston 6 is<br>
linearly reciprocated in the cylinder 4, for compressing the refrigerants sucked into a<br>
compression space P in the cylinder 4, and various springs elastically support the<br>
piston 6 in its motion direction. The piston 6 is connected to a linear motor 10 for<br>
generating a linear reciprocation driving force.<br>
[51]	A suction valve 22 is installed at one end of the piston 6 contacting the compression<br>
space P. A discharge valve assembly 24 is installed at one end of the cylinder 4<br>
contacting the compression space P. The suction valve 22 and the discharge valve<br>
assembly 24 are automatically opened and closed according to an inner pressure of the<br>
compression space P, respectively.<br>
[52]	The hermetic container 2 is installed by hermetically coupling upper and lower<br>
shells. The inflow tube 2a for sicking the refrigerants and the outflow tube 2b for<br>
discharging the refrigerants are installed at one side of the hermetic container 2. The<br>
piston 6 is elastically supported in its motion direction inside the cylinder 4 for linear<br>
reciprocation, and the linear motor 10 is coupled to a frame 18 outside the cylinder 4,<br>
thereby forming an assembly. This assembly is elastically supported on the inner<br>
bottom surface of the hermetic container 2 by support springs 29.<br>
[53]	A predetermined amount of oil is filled on the inner bottom surface of the hermetic<br>
container 2. An oil pumping device 30 for pumping the oil is installed at the bottom<br>
end of the assembly. An oil supply tube 18a is formed in the frame 18 disposed at the<br>
lower portion of the assembly, for supplying the oil to the gap between the piston 6<br>
and the cylinder 4. The oil supply device 30 is operated by vibration generated by the<br>
linear reciprocation of the piston 6, for pumping the oil. The oil is supplied to the gap<br>
between the piston 6 and the cylinder 4 through the oil supply tube 18a, for performing<br>
cooling and lubrication.<br>
[54]	The cylinder 4 is formed in a hollow shape, so that the piston 6 can be linearly reciprocated<br>
in the cylinder 4. The compression space P is formed at one side of the<br>
cylinder 4. In a state where one end of the cylinder 4 approaches the inner portion of<br>
the inflow tube 2a, the cylinder 4 is preferably installed on the same straight line with<br>
the inflow tube 2a. The piston 6 is installed inside one end of the cylinder 4 close to<br>
the inflow tube 2a for linear reciprocation. The discharge valve assembly 24 is installed at one end of the cylinder 4 opposite to the inflow tube 2a.<br>
[55]	The discharge valve assembly 24 includes a discharge cover 24a installed at one<br>
end of the cylinder 4, for forming a discharge space, a discharge valve 24b for opening<br>
 <br>
and closing one end of the cylinder 4 close to the compression space P, and a valve<br>
spring 24c, which is a kind of coil spring, for applying an elastic force in the axial<br>
direction between the discharge cover 24a and the discharge valve 24b. An O-ring is<br>
inserted onto the inner circumference of one end of the cylinder 4, so that the discharge<br>
valve 24a can be closely adhered to one end of the cylinder 4.<br>
[56]	A loop pipe 28 is curvedly installed between one side of the discharge cover 24a<br>
and the outflow tube 2b. The loop pipe 28 guides the compressed refrigerants to be<br>
externally discharged, and buffers the vibration generated by the interactions of the<br>
cylinder 4, the piston 6 and the linear motor 10 and transferred to the whole hermetic<br>
container 2.<br>
[57]	When the piston 6 is linearly reciprocated in the cylinder 4, if a pressure of the<br>
compression space P is over a predetermined discharge pressure, the valve spring 24c<br>
is compressed to open the discharge valve 24b. After the refrigerants are discharged<br>
from the compression space P, the refrigerants are completely externally discharged<br>
through the loop pipe 28 and the outflow tube 2b.<br>
[58]	A refrigerant passage 6a is formed at the center portion of the piston 6, so that the<br>
refrigerants sucked through the inflow tube 2a can pass through the refrigerant passage<br>
6a. The linear motor 10 is connected directly to one end of the piston 6 close to the<br>
inflow tube 2a by a connection member 17, and the suction valve 22 is installed at the<br>
other end of the piston 6 opposite to the inflow tube 2a. The piston 6 is elastkally<br>
supported in its motion direction by various springs.<br>
[59]	The suction valve 22 is formed in a thin plate shape with its center portion partially<br>
cut to open and close the refrigerant passage 6a of the piston 6. One side of the suction<br>
valve 22 is fixed to one end of the piston 6 by using screws.<br>
[60]	Accordingly, when the piston 6 is linearly reciprocated inside the cylinder 4, if the<br>
pressure of the compression space P is below a predetermined suction pressure lower<br>
than the discharge pressure, the suction valve 22 is opened and the refrigerants are<br>
supplied into the compression space P, and if the pressure of the compression space P<br>
is over the predetermined suction pressure, the suction valve 22 is closed and the re-<br>
frigerants are compressed in the compression space P.<br>
[61]	Especially, the piston 6 is elastkally supported in its motion direction. In detail, a<br>
piston flange 6b radially protruded from one end of the piston 6 close to the inflow<br>
tube 2a is elastically supported in the motion direction of the piston 6 by mechanical<br>
springs 8a and 8b such as coil springs. In addition, the refrigerants filled in the<br>
compression space P in the opposite direction to the inflow tube 2a are operated as a<br>
 <br>
gas spring by a self elastic force, for elastically supporting the piston 6.<br>
[62]	The mechanical springs 8a and 8b have a constant mechanical spring constant K<br>
m<br>
regardless of a load. Preferably, the mechanical springs 8a and 8b are installed at a<br>
support frame 26 fixed to the linear motor 10 and the cylinder 4, respectively, in the<br>
axial direction with the piston flange 6b therebetween. The mechanical springs 8a<br>
supported on the support frame 26 and the mechanical springs 8b installed in the<br>
cylinder 4 have the same mechanical spring constant K .<br>
m<br>
[63]	Fig. 3 is a circuit view illustrating a control apparatus for a linear compressor in<br>
accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[64]	Still referring to Fig. 2, the linear motor 10 includes an inner stator 12 formed by<br>
laminating a plurality of laminations 12a in the circumferential direction, and fixed to<br>
the outer portion of the cylinder 4 by the frame 18, an outer stator 14 formed by<br>
laminating a plurality of laminations 14b in the circumferential direction around a coil<br>
winding body 14a formed by winding a coil, and installed at the outer portion of the<br>
cylinder 4 by the frame 18 with a predetermined gap from the inner stator 12, and a<br>
permanent magnet 16 disposed at the gap between the inner stator 12 and the outer<br>
stator 14, and connected to the piston 6 by the connection member 17. The coil<br>
winding body 14a can be fixed to the outer portion of the inner stator 12.<br>
[65]	As shown in Fig. 3, the control apparatus for the linear compressor includes an on/<br>
off switch SW1 40 for receiving power and supplying power to the linear motor 10, a<br>
coil winding body L (identical to the coil winding body 14a of Fig. 2) wound in the<br>
circumferential direction of the linear compressor, a capacitor C1 connected in series<br>
to the coil winding body L, a capacitance varying unit 50 connected in parallel to the<br>
capacitor CI, and a control unit 60 for controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 to<br>
change an output of the linear compressor.<br>
[66]	In detail, the on/off switch SWl 40 is a main switch for applying power to the<br>
linear motor 10 by the control of the control unit 60. Here, the power means external<br>
commercial power, or power applied from a power supply unit of a linear compressor<br>
mounted apparatus (for example, a refrigerator, etc.).<br>
[67]	The capacitor C1 and the capacitance varying unit 50 determine the whole capacitance<br>
of the linear motor 10, and are connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
[68]	The capacitance varying unit 50 is formed by connecting a capacitor C2, a capacitor<br>
switch SW2 and an inrush current prevention device 52 in series. The capacitance<br>
varying unit 50 can be provided in a multiple number and connected in parallel to the<br>
capacitor C1.<br>
 <br>
[69]	The capacitor C2 has a smaller capacitance than the capacitor C1. The capacitor<br>
switch SW2 applies a current or voltage from the power supply source to the coil<br>
winding body L through the capacitor C2. When the control unit 60 controls the capacitance<br>
varying unit 50, it means that the control unit 60 controls on/off of the<br>
capacitor switch SW2.<br>
[70]	In a state where the on/off switch SWl 40 is closed, if the capacitor switch SW2 is<br>
turned on, an inrush current of making electric charges charged in the capacitor C1 instantaneously<br>
flow into the capacitor C2 is generated, to deposit a contact point of the<br>
capacitor switch SW2. The inrush current prevention device 52 is provided to prevent<br>
the capacitor switch SW2 from being damaged by the inrush current. Therefore, the<br>
inrush current prevention device 52 includes at least one of a resistor, a negative<br>
temperature coefficient (NTC) device and an inductor to convert the inrush current into<br>
a different type of energy or prevent the inrush current from being excessively applied<br>
to the capacitor switch SW2.<br>
[71]	The control unit 60 varies the whole capacitance of the linear motor 10 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50. That is, the control unit 60 changes the<br>
output of the linear compressor, namely, the cooling force by varying the capacitance<br>
and also varying an operating frequency by the coil winding body L. Especially, the<br>
output size of the linear compressor must be varied according to a load. However, the<br>
output of the linear compressor can be increased or decreased regardless of the load.<br>
The control operation of the control unit 60 for changing the output and preventing the<br>
inrush current will later be explained with reference to Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
[72]	Fig. 4 is a circuit view illustrating a control" apparatus for a linear compressor in<br>
accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[73]	As depicted in Fig. 4, the control apparatus for the linear compressor includes an<br>
on/off switch SW1 40 for receiving power and supplying power to the linear motor 10,<br>
a coil winding body L (identical to the coil winding body 14a of Fig. 2) wound in the<br>
circumferential direction of the linear compressor, a capacitor C1 connected in series<br>
to the coil winding body L, a capacitance varying unit 50a having one end connected<br>
to one end of the capacitor C1 and the other end connected to a winding tap T of the<br>
coil winding body L, the capacitance varying unit 50a being connected in parallel to<br>
the capacitor C1, and a control unit 60 for controlling the capacitance varying unit 50a<br>
to change an output of the linear compressor.<br>
[74]	Here, the on/off switch SWl 40, the coil winding body L and the capacitor C1 of<br>
Fig. 4 are identical to those of Fig. 3 with the same reference numerals.<br>
 <br>
[75]	The capacitance varying unit 50a of Fig. 4 is formed by connecting a capacitor C3<br>
and a capacitor switch SW2 in series. Differently from the capacitance varying unit 50<br>
of Fig. 3, the capacitance varying unit 50a of Fig. 4 does not include the inrush current<br>
prevention device 52. The other end of the capacitance varying unit 50a is connected<br>
directly to the winding tap T of the coil winding body L, so that the coil between the<br>
capacitor C1 and the winding tap T can serve as an inductor. Even if an inrush current<br>
is generated, the inrush current does not damage the capacitor switch SW2. That is, the<br>
inrush current prevention device 52 of Fig. 3 is not necessary by connecting the capacitance<br>
varying unit 50a to the coil winding body L. As a result, the area occupied<br>
by the linear motor 10 is reduced and the production cost is cut down. For example, a<br>
resistor consumes the inrush current by heat emission. As the heat emission by the<br>
current is continuously performed during the operation, the temperature of the linear<br>
motor 10 is raised. In addition, when an ambient temperature is high, a resistance value<br>
of an NTC device is reduced not to efficiently intercept the inrush current.<br>
Furthermore, since an inductor is relatively large, the inductor occupies a large area in<br>
the linear compressor. The aforementioned problems can be solved by connecting the<br>
capacitance varying unit 50a to the coil winding body L.<br>
[76]	The capacitance varying unit 50a can be provided in a multiple number and<br>
connected in parallel to the capacitor C1. Here, one or more winding taps T can be<br>
used for the capacitance varying units 50a.<br>
[77]	The capacitor C3 is identical to the capacitor C2 of Fig. 3 in the element characteristic<br>
(including the size of the capacitance) and the function. When the control<br>
unit 60 controls the capacitance varying unit 50a, it means that the control unit 60<br>
controls on/off of the capacitor switch SW2.<br>
[78]	The control unit 60 varies the whole capacitance of the linear motor 10 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50a. That is, the control unit 60 changes the<br>
output of the linear compressor, namely, the cooling force by varying the capacitance<br>
and also varying an operating frequency by the coil winding body L. Especially, the<br>
output size of the linear compressor must be varied according to a load. However, the<br>
output of the linear compressor can be increased or decreased regardless of the load.<br>
The control operation of the control unit 60 for changing the output and preventing the<br>
inrush current will now be explained with reference to Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
[79]	Fig. 5 is a flowchart showing sequential steps of a control method of the control apparatuses<br>
of Figs. 3 and 4 in accordance with a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention. At the initial stage, the control unit 60 closes the on/off switch SW1 40 to<br>
 <br>
apply power to the coil winding body L and the capacitor C1, so that the linear<br>
compressor can generate a predetermined output.<br>
[80]	In step S51, the control unit 60 decides whether the linear compressor needs to<br>
generate an additional cooling force. As described above, the cooling force can be<br>
required according to the load or regardless of the load. Such a decision is appropriately<br>
made in each case. If the cooling force is required (if the high cooling force<br>
control is required), the routine goes to step S52, and if not, (if the high cooling force<br>
control is not required, namely, if the low cooling force control is maintained, or if the<br>
current high cooling force control is ended and the low cooling force control is<br>
started), the routine goes to step S55.<br>
[81]	In step S52, the control unit 60 turns off (opens) the on/off switch SW1 40. The<br>
control unit 60 maintains the off state for a predetermined time (for example, a few<br>
seconds), so that the electric charges charged in the capacitor C1 can be consumed to<br>
some extent.<br>
[82]	In step S53, the control unit 60 turns on (closes) the capacitor switch SW2 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a. The control unit 60 maintains the<br>
on state (SW1 is off and SW2 is on), so that the electric charges charged in the<br>
capacitor C1 can be almost completely consumed. Such consumption is carried out by<br>
the inrush current prevention device 52 or some coil of the coil winding body L.<br>
[83]	In step S54, the control unit 60 turns on (closes) the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply<br>
power to the capacitor C1 and the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a (namely, the<br>
capacitor C2 or C3). As the whole capacitance increases, the high cooling force<br>
operation is performed.<br>
[84]	In step S55, the control unit 60 decides whether the capacitor switch SW2 is<br>
currently turned on, namely, closed. If the capacitor switch SW2 is turned on (if the<br>
high cooling force operation is currently performed), the routine goes to step S56, and<br>
if not, the routine is ended, and the current low cooling force operation is maintained<br>
as it is.<br>
[85]	In step S57, the control unit 60 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40. The control unit<br>
60 maintains the off state for a predetermined time as in step S52. If the control unit 60<br>
omits S57 and performs S58, the inrush current generated by the electric charges<br>
charged in the capacitor C2 or C3 flows into the on/off switch SW1 40 and damages<br>
the on/off switch SW1 40. Therefore, the step S57 is necessary.<br>
[86]	In step S58, the control unit 60 turns off (opens) the capacitor switch SW2. The<br>
control unit 60 maintains the open state for a predetermined time, so that the electric<br>
 <br>
charges charged in the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor C2 or C3, especially in the<br>
capacitor C2 or C3 can be consumed.<br>
[87]	In step S59, the control unit 60 turns on the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply power<br>
through the capacitor C1 and the coil winding body L. As the whole capacitance<br>
decreases, the low cooling force operation is performed.<br>
[88]	In accordance with the control method of the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the control unit 60 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40 before varying the<br>
whole capacitance by controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a. Therefore, in<br>
addition to the inrush current prevention configuration of Figs. 3 and 4, the control unit<br>
60 prevents an additional inrush current.<br>
[89]	Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing sequential steps of a control method of the control apparatuses<br>
of Figs. 3 and 4 in accordance with a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[90]	In step S61, the control unit 60 decides whether to stop the linear compressor<br>
performing the high cooling force operation or the low cooling force operation. Here,<br>
the control unit 60 stops the operation of the linear compressor according to a<br>
command from the linear compressor mounted apparatus, or when the cooling force is<br>
sufficient. If the control unit 60 intends to stop the operation of the linear compressor,<br>
the routine goes to step S62, and if the control unit 60 intends to maintain the current<br>
operation of the linear compressor, the routine is ended.<br>
[91]	In step S62, the control unit 60 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40 not to apply<br>
power to the coil winding body L and the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor C2 or C3<br>
any more, so that the electric charges charged in the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor<br>
C2 or C3 can be consumed. The control unit 60 maintains the off state of the on/off<br>
switch SW1 40 for a predetermined time.<br>
[92]	In step S63, the control unit 60 decides whether the capacitor switch SW2 is turned<br>
on. If the capacitor switch SW2 is turned on (if the high cooling force operation is<br>
currently performed), the routine goes to step S64, and if not (if the low cooling force<br>
operation is currently performed), the routine is ended.<br>
[93]	In step S64, the control unit 60 turns off the capacitor switch SW2, so that the<br>
electric charges charged in the capacitor C2 or C3 and/or the capacitor C1 can be<br>
consumed.<br>
[94]	As described above, in the case that the control unit 60 stops the operation of the<br>
linear compressor, the control unit 60 preferentially turns off the on/off switch SW1<br>
40, and then turns off the capacitor switch SW2, thereby preventing the switch SW2 or<br>
 <br>
SW1 from being damaged by the inrush current.<br>
[95]	Fig. 7 is a circuit view illustrating a control apparatus for a linear compressor in<br>
accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 7,<br>
the control apparatus for the linear compressor includes an on/off switch SW1 40 for<br>
receiving power and supplying power to the linear motor 10, a coil winding body L<br>
(identical to the coil winding body 14a of Fig. 2) wound in the circumferential<br>
direction of the linear compressor, a capacitor C1 connected in series to the coil<br>
winding body L, a capacitance varying unit 50 connected in parallel to the capacitor<br>
C1, voltage sensing units 61 and 62 for sensing both end voltages Vc1 and Vc2 of each<br>
of the capacitor C1 and the capacitor C2 (or the capacitance varying unit 50), and a<br>
control unit 70 for controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 to change an output of<br>
the linear compressor.<br>
[96]	Here, the on/off switch SW1 40, the coil winding body L, the capacitor C1 and the<br>
capacitance varying unit 50 of Fig. 7 are identical to those of Fig. 3 with the same<br>
reference numerals.<br>
[97]	When the on/off switch SW1 40 is turned on, the voltage sensing unit 61 senses the<br>
both end voltage Vcl of the capacitor C1. When the on/off switch SW1 40 and the<br>
capacitor switch SW2 are turned on, the voltage sensing unit 62 senses the both end<br>
voltage of the capacitor C2 or the both end voltage Vc2 of the capacitance varying unit<br>
50. If power applied to the linear motor 10 is varied, the voltage of the varied power<br>
directly influences the both end voltages Vc1 and Vc2 of the capacitor C1 and the<br>
capacitor C2 or the capacitance varying unit 50. The variation degree of the applied<br>
power can be precisely checked by sensing the voltages Vcl and Vc2. As mentioned<br>
above, since the capacitor C1 has a larger capacitance than the capacitor C2, the<br>
voltage Vc1 can be used. The both end voltage Vc2 of the capacitance varying unit 50<br>
can also be used.<br>
[98]	The control unit 70 varies the whole capacitance of the linear motor 10 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50. That is, the control unit 70 changes the<br>
output of the linear compressor, namely, the cooling force by varying the capacitance<br>
and also varying an operating frequency by the coil winding body L. Especially, the<br>
control unit 70 recognizes the variation degree of the applied power by the voltage<br>
sensing unit 61 or 62. If a sensed voltage Vc (including at least one of Vcl and Vc2) is<br>
lowered (especially in the low cooling force operation), the output decreases. The high<br>
cooling force operation is required to maintain the current output. Accordingly, the<br>
control unit 70 performs the high oooling force operation. If the sensed voltage Vc is<br>
 <br>
raised (especially in the high cooling force operation), the output increases. The low<br>
cooling force operation is required to maintain the current output. Therefore, the<br>
control unit 70 performs the low cooling force operation. The control operation of the<br>
control unit 70 for changing the output and preventing the inrush current will later be<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 9.<br>
[99]	Fig. 8 is a circuit view illustrating a control apparatus for a linear compressor in<br>
accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 8, the<br>
linear motor 10 (namely, the control apparatus for the linear compressor) includes an<br>
on/off switch SW1 40 for receiving power and supplying power to the linear motor 10,<br>
a coil winding body L (identical to the coil winding body 14a of Fig. 2) wound in the<br>
circumferential direction of the linear compressor, a capacitor C1 connected in series<br>
to the coil winding body L, a capacitance varying unit 50a having one end connected<br>
to one end of the capacitor C1 and the other end connected to a winding tap T of the<br>
coil winding body L, the capacitance varying unit 50a being connected in parallel to<br>
the capacitor C1, voltage sensing units 61 and 63 for sensing both end voltages Vc1<br>
and Vc3 of each of the capacitor C1 and the capacitor C3 (or the capacitance varying<br>
unit 50a), and a control unit 70 for controlling the capacitance varying unit 50a to<br>
change an output of the linear compressor.<br>
[100]	Here, the on/off switch SW1 40, the coil winding body L, the capacitor C1 and the<br>
capacitance varying unit 50a of Fig. 8 are identical to those of Fig. 4 with the same<br>
reference numerals.<br>
[101]	When the on/off switch SW1 40 is turned on, the voltage sensing unit 61 senses the<br>
both end voltage Vc1 of the capacitor C1. When the on/off switch SW1 40 and the<br>
capacitor switch SW2 are turned on, the voltage sensing unit 63 senses the both end<br>
voltage of the capacitor C3 or the both end voltage Vc3 of the capacitance varying unit<br>
50a. When power applied to the linear motor 10 is varied, the voltage of the varied<br>
power directly influences the both end voltages Vc1 and Vc3 of the capacitor C1 and<br>
the capacitor C3 or the capacitance varying unit 50a. The variation degree of the<br>
applied power can be precisely checked by sensing the voltages Vc1 and Vc3. As<br>
described above, since the capacitor Cl has a larger capacitance than the capacitor C3,<br>
the voltage Vc1 can be used. The both end voltage Vc3 of the capacitance varying unit<br>
50a or the capacitor C3 can also be used.<br>
[102] The control unit 70 varies the whole capacitance of the linear motor 10 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50a. That is, the control unit 70 changes the<br>
output of the linear compressor, namely, the cooling force by varying the capacitance<br>
 <br>
and also varying an operating frequency by the coil winding body L. Especially, the<br>
control unit 70 recognizes the variation degree of the applied power by the voltage<br>
sensing unit 61 or 63. If a sensed voltage Vc (including at least one of Vc1 and Vc3) is<br>
lowered (especially in the low cooling force operation), the output decreases. The high<br>
cooling force operation is required to maintain the current output. Accordingly, the<br>
control unit 70 performs the high cooling force operation. If the sensed voltage Vc is<br>
raised (especially in the high cooling force operation), the output increases. The low<br>
cooling force operation is required to maintain the current output. Therefore, the<br>
control unit 70 performs the low cooling force operation. The control operation of the<br>
control unit 70 for changing the output and preventing the inrush current will now be<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 9.<br>
[103]	Fig. 9 is a flowchart showing sequential steps of a control method of the control apparatuses<br>
of Figs. 7 and 8.<br>
[104]	At the initial stage, the control unit 70 closes the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply<br>
power to the coil winding body L and the capacitor C1, so that the linear compressor<br>
can generate a predetermined output. Hereinafter, it is presumed that the control unit<br>
70 uses the both end voltage Vc1 of the capacitor C1 as the voltage Vc.<br>
[105]	In step S71, the control unit 70 receives the both end voltage Vc of the capacitor C1<br>
from the voltage sensing unit 61, and compares the both end voltage Vc with an<br>
overload voltage Vo. The overload voltage Vo is a prestored value of the control unit<br>
70. The overload voltage Vo indicates that the linear compressor may undergo an<br>
overload or perform an abnormal operation, and reflects a value of the Vo-applying<br>
power. Therefore, the control unit 70 compares the voltage Vc with the overload<br>
voltage Vo. If the voltage Vc is lower than the overload voltage Vo, the routine goes to<br>
step S72, and if the voltage Vc is equal to or higher than the overload voltage Vo, the<br>
routine goes to step S80 to intercept the applied power.<br>
[106] In step S72, the control unit 70 checks whether the power applied to the linear<br>
compressor has been changed, and performs an operation for maintaining a current<br>
cooling force in the following steps S73 to S79. Here, a reference voltage Vr is<br>
compared with the voltage Vc. The reference voltage Vr means an optimum size<br>
voltage for enabling the control unit 70 to stably perform the high and low cooling<br>
force operations. In the case that the applied power is varied from 187 to 250V, the<br>
reference voltage Vr is set to have one value, for example, 220V, or set within a predetermined<br>
range (200 to 240V). In step S72, if the voltage Vc is lower than the<br>
reference voltage Vr, the output decreases. To solve this problem, the control unit 70<br>
 <br>
goes to step S73 for the high cooling force operation. If the voltage Vc is equal to or<br>
higher than the reference voltage Vr, the output increases. To prevent this, the control<br>
unit 70 goes to step S76 for the low cooling force operation.<br>
[107] 	In step S73, the control unit 70 turns off (opens) the on/off switch SW1 40. The<br>
control unit 70 maintains the off state for a predetermined time (for example, a few<br>
seconds), so that the electric charges charged in the capacitor C1 can be consumed to<br>
some extent.<br>
[108] 	In step S74, the control unit 70 turns on (closes) the capacitor switch SW2 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a. The control unit 60 maintains the<br>
on state (SWl is off and SW2 is on), so that the electric charges charged in the<br>
capacitor C1 can be almost completely consumed. Sush consumption is carried out by<br>
the inrush current prevention device 52 or some coil of the coil winding body L.<br>
[109]	In step S75, the control unit 70 turns on (closes) the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply<br>
power to the capacitor C1 and the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a (namely, the<br>
capacitor C2 or C3). As the whole capacitance increases, the high cooling force<br>
operation is performed.<br>
[110]	In step S76, the control unit 70 decides whether the capacitor switch SW2 is<br>
currently turned on, namely, closed. If the capacitor switch SW2 is turned on (if the<br>
high cooling force operation is currently performed), the routine goes to step S77, and<br>
if not, the routine is ended, and the current low cooling force operation is maintained<br>
as it is.<br>
[111]	In step S77, the control unit 70 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40. The control unit<br>
70 maintains the off state for a predetermined time as in step S73. If the control unit 70<br>
omits S77 and performs S78, the inrush current generated by the electric charges<br>
charged in the capacitor C2 flows into the on/off switch SW1 40 and damages the on/<br>
off switch SW1 40. Therefore, the step S77 is necessary.<br>
[112]	In step S78, the control unit 70 turns off (opens) the capacitor switch SW2. The<br>
control unit 70 maintains the open state for a predetermined time, so that the electric<br>
charges charged in the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor C2 or C3, especially in the<br>
capacitor C2 or C3 can be consumed. In the case that the plurality of capacitance<br>
varying units 50 or 50a are connected in parallel, the control unit 70 opens or closes<br>
each capacitor switch SW2, thereby variously varying the capacitance.<br>
[113]	In step S79, the control unit 70 turns on the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply power<br>
through the capacitor C1 and the coil winding body L. As the whole capacitance<br>
decreases, the low cooling force operation is performed.<br>
 <br>
[114]	In step S80, the control unit 70 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40 not to apply<br>
power to the coil winding body L and the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor C2 or C3<br>
any more, so that the electric charges charged in the capacitor C1 and/or the capaitor<br>
C2 or C3 can be consumed. The control unit 70 maintains the off state of the on/off<br>
switch SW1 40 for a predetermined time.<br>
[115]	In step S81, the control unit 70 decides whether the capacitor switch SW2 is turned<br>
on. If the capacitor switch SW2 is turned on (if the high cooling force operation is<br>
currently performed), the routine goes to step S82, and if not (if the low cooling force<br>
operation is currently performed), the routine is ended.<br>
[116]	In step S82, the control unit 70 turns off the capaitor switch SW2, so that the<br>
electric charges charged in the capacitor C2 or C3 and/or the capacitor C1 can be<br>
consumed.<br>
[117]	In accordance with the above control method of the present invention, the control<br>
unit 70 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40 before varying the whole capacitance by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a. As a result, in addition to the inrush<br>
current prevention configuration of Figs. 7 and 8, the control unit 70 prevents an<br>
additional inrush current.<br>
[118]	In the case that the control unit 70 stops the operation of the linear compressor, the<br>
control unit 70 preferentially turns off the on/off switch SW1 40, and then turns off the<br>
capacitor switch SW2, thereby preventing the switch SW2 or SWl from being<br>
damaged by the inrush current.<br>
[119]	Fig. 10 is a circuit view illustrating a control apparatus for a linear compressor in<br>
accordance with a fifth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 10, the<br>
control apparatus for the linear compressor includes an on/off switch SW1 40 for<br>
receiving power and supplying power to the linear motor 10, a coil winding body L<br>
(identical to the coil winding body 14a of Fig. 2) wound in the circumferential<br>
direction of the linear compressor, a capacitor C1 connected in series to the coil<br>
winding body L, a capacitance varying unit 50 connected in parallel to the capacitor<br>
C1, voltage sensing units 61 and 62 for sensing both end voltages Vc1 and Vc2 of each<br>
of the capacitor C1 and the capacitor C2 (or the capacitance varying unit 50), a voltage<br>
and frequency sensing unit 65 for sensing a voltage Vi and a frequency Fi of the<br>
applied power, and a control unit 80 for controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 to<br>
change an output of the linear compressor.<br>
[120]	Here, the on/off switch SW1 40, the coil winding body L, the capaitor C1, the cap<br>
acitance varying unit 50 and the voltage sensing units 61 and 62 of Fig. 10 are<br>
 <br>
identical to those of Fig. 7 with the same reference numerals.<br>
[121]	The voltage and frequency sensing unit 65 senses the voltage Vi and the frequency<br>
Fi of the applied power. Here, the voltage Vi and the frequency Fi are factors directly<br>
influencing the output of the linear compressor. The voltage and frequency sensing<br>
unit 65 must be provided to judge the variation degree of power in consideration of the<br>
voltage Vi and the frequency Fi.<br>
[122]	The control unit 80 varies the whole capacitance of the linear motor 10 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50. That is, the control unit 80 changes the<br>
output of the linear compressor, namely, the cooling force by varying the capacitance<br>
and also varying an operating frequency by the coil winding body L.<br>
[123]	Especially, in order to judge the variation degree of the applied power, the control<br>
unit 80 computes a mode voltage Vm by a function including the voltage Vi and the<br>
frequency Fi from the voltage and frequency sensing unit 65 as factors, and compares<br>
the mode voltage Vm with a predetermined reference value a (a is a constant). That is,<br>
the mode voltage Vm is oomputed by the function of the voltage Vi and the frequency<br>
Fi. The influences, namely, influence degrees of the voltage Vi and the frequency Fi<br>
on the cooling force, namely, the output of the linear compressor may be different. It is<br>
thus not reasonable to compare the voltage Vi and the frequency Fi with a reference<br>
voltage and a reference frequency, respectively. Various functions such as a linear<br>
function and a quadratic function can be used as the function for oomputing the mode<br>
voltage Vm in order to precisely manifest such influence degrees. In this embodiment,<br>
the mode voltage Vm is represented by the following formula 2.<br>
[124]	Formula 2<br>
[125]	Vm = Vi + (Fi-b) x a<br>
[126]	Here, a and b are constants with a predetermined size.<br>
[127]	In addition, the control unit 80 recognizes the variation degree of the applied power<br>
by the voltage sensing unit 61 or 62. If a sensed voltage Vc (including at least one of<br>
Vc1 and Vc2) is lower than an overload voltage Vo, the control unit 80 maintains the<br>
current output. If the sensed voltage Vc is equal to or higher than the overload voltage<br>
Vo, the control unit 80 stops power supply to overcome an overload. The control<br>
operation of the control unit 80 for changing the output and preventing the inrush<br>
current will later be explained with reference to Fig. 12.<br>
[128]	Fig. 11 is a circuit view illustrating a control apparatus for a linear compressor in<br>
accordance with a sixth embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in Fig. 11,<br>
the control apparatus for the linear compressor includes an on/off switch SW1 40 for<br>
 <br>
receiving power and supplying power to the linear motor 10, a coil winding body L<br>
(identical to the coil winding body 14a of Fig. 2) wound in the circumferential<br>
direction of the linear compressor, a capacitor C1 connected in series to the coil<br>
winding body L, a capacitance varying unit 50a having one end connected to one end<br>
of the capacitor C1 and the other end connected to a winding tap T of the coil winding<br>
body L, the capacitance varying unit 50a being connected in parallel to the capacitor<br>
C1, voltage sensing units 61 and 63 for sensing both end voltages Vc1 and Vc3 of each<br>
of the capacitor C1 and the capacitor C3 (or the capacitance varying unit 50a), a<br>
voltage and frequency sensing unit 65 for sensing a voltage Vi and a frequency Fi of<br>
the applied power, and a control unit 80 for controlling the capacitance varying unit<br>
50a to change an output of the linear compressor.<br>
[129]	Here, the on/off switch SW1 40, the coil winding body L, the capacitor C1, the capadtance<br>
varying unit 50a and the voltage sensing units 61 and 63 of Fig. 11 are<br>
identical to those of Fig. 8 with the same reference numerals.<br>
[130]	The voltage and frequency sensing unit 65 of Fig. 11 is identical to the voltage and<br>
frequency sensing unit 65 of Fig. 10.<br>
[131] 	he control unit 80 is identical to the control unit 80 of Fig. 10 and operated in the<br>
same manner. However, the control unit 80 uses the voltage Vc3 sensed by the voltage<br>
sensing unit 63, not the voltage sensing unit 62 of Fig. 10. That is, the control unit 80<br>
recognizes the variation degree of the applied power by the voltage sensing unit 61 or<br>
63. If a sensed voltage Vc (including at least one of Vc1 and Vc3) is lower than an<br>
overload voltage Vo, the control unit 80 maintains the current output. If the sensed<br>
voltage Vc is equal to or higher than the overload voltage Vo, the control unit 80 stops<br>
power supply to overcome an overload. The control operation of the control unit 80 for<br>
changing the output and preventing the inrush current will now be explained with<br>
reference to Fig. 12.<br>
[132]	Fig. 12 is a flowchart showing sequential steps of a control method of the control<br>
apparatuses of Figs. 10 and 11.<br>
[133]	At the initial stage, the control unit 80 closes the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply<br>
power to the coil winding body L and the capacitor C1, so that the linear compressor<br>
can generate a predetermined output. Hereinafter, it is presumed that the control unit<br>
80 uses the both end voltage Vc1 of the capacitor C1 as the voltage Vc.<br>
[134] In step S91, the control unit 80 receives the both end voltage Vc from the voltage<br>
sensing unit 61, and compares the both end voltage Vc with the overload voltage Vo.<br>
The overload voltage Vo is a prestored value of the control unit 80. The overload<br>
 <br>
voltage Vo indicates that the linear compressor may undergo an overload or perform<br>
an abnormal operation, and reflects a value of the Vo-applying power. Therefore, the<br>
control unit 80 oompares the voltage Vc with the overload voltage Vo. If the voltage<br>
Vc is lower than the overload voltage Vo, the routine goes to step S92, and if the<br>
voltage Vc is equal to or higher than the overload voltage Vo, the routine goes to step<br>
S100 to intercept the applied power.<br>
[135]	In step S92, the control unit 80 checks whether the power applied to the linear<br>
compressor has been changed, and performs an operation for maintaining a current<br>
cooling force in the following steps S93 to S99. Here, the reference value a is<br>
compared with the mode voltage Vm. The reference value a means an optimum value<br>
for enabling the control unit 80 to stably perform the high and low cooling force<br>
operations. The reference value a can be set to have one value, or set within a predetermined<br>
range. In step S92, if the mode voltage Vm is smaller than the reference<br>
value a, the output decreases. To solve this problem, the control unit 80 goes to step<br>
S93 for the high cooling force operation. If the mode voltage Vm is equal to or larger<br>
than the reference value a, the output increases. To prevent this, the control unit 80<br>
goes to step S96 for the low cooling force operation.<br>
[136] In step S93, the control unit 80 turns off (opens) the on/off switch SW1 40. The<br>
control unit 80 maintains the off state for a predetermined time (for example, a few<br>
seconds), so that the electric charges charged in the capacitor C1 can be consumed to<br>
some extent.<br>
[137]	In step S94, the control unit 80 turns on (closes) the capacitor switch SW2 by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a. The control unit 80 maintains the<br>
on state (SWl is off and SW2 is on), so that the electric charges charged in the<br>
capacitor C1 can be almost completely consumed. Such consumption is carried out by<br>
the inrush current prevention device 52 or some coil of the coil winding body L.<br>
[138]	In step S95, the control unit 80 turns on (closes) the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply<br>
power to the capacitor C1 and the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a (namely, the<br>
capacitor C2 or C3). As the whole capacitance increases, the high cooling force<br>
operation is performed.<br>
[139]	In step S96, the control unit 80 decides whether the capacitor switch SW2 is<br>
currently turned on, namely, closed. If the capacitor switch SW2 is turned on (if the<br>
high cooling force operation is currently performed), the routine goes to step S97, and<br>
if not, the routine is ended, and the current low cooling force operation is maintained<br>
as it is.<br>
 <br>
[140]	In step S97, the control unit 80 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40. The control unit<br>
80 maintains the off state for a predetermined time as in step S93. If the control unit 80<br>
omits S97 and performs S98, the inrush current generated by the electric charges<br>
charged in the capacitor C2 flows into the on/off switch SW1 40 and damages the on/<br>
off switch SW1 40. Therefore, the step S97 is necessary.<br>
[141] In step S98, the control unit 80 turns off (opens) the capaitor switch SW2. The<br>
control unit 80 maintains the open state for a predetermined time, so that the electric<br>
charges charged in the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor C2 or C3, especially in the<br>
capacitor C2 or C3 can be consumed. In the case that the plurality of capacitance<br>
varying units 50 or 50a are connected in parallel, the control unit 80 opens or closes<br>
each capacitor switch SW2, thereby variously varying the capacitance.<br>
[142]	In step S99, the control unit 80 turns on the on/off switch SW1 40 to apply power<br>
through the capacitor C1 and the coil winding body L. As the whole capacitance<br>
decreases, the low cooling force operation is performed.<br>
[143]	In step SlOO, the control unit 80 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40 not to apply<br>
power to the coil winding body L and the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor C2 or C3<br>
any more, so that the electric charges charged in the capacitor C1 and/or the capacitor C2 or C3 can be consumed. The control unit 80 maintains the off state of the on/off<br>
switch SW1 40 for a predetermined time.<br>
[144] In step S101, the control unit 80 decides whether the capacitor switch SW2 is<br>
turned on. If the capacitor switch SW2 is turned on (if the high cooling force operation<br>
is currently performed), the routine goes to step S102, and if not (if the low cooling<br>
force operation is currently performed), the routine is ended.<br>
[145]	In step S102, the control unit 80 turns off the capacitor switch SW2, so that the<br>
electric charges charged in the capacitor C2 or C3 and/or the capacitor C1 can be<br>
consumed.<br>
[146] In accordance with the above control method of the present invention, the control<br>
unit 80 turns off the on/off switch SW1 40 before varying the whole capacitance by<br>
controlling the capacitance varying unit 50 or 50a. Therefore, in addition to the inrush<br>
current prevention configuration of Figs. 10 and 11, the control unit 80 prevents an<br>
additional inrush current.<br>
[147]	In the case that the control unit 80 stops the operation of the linear compressor, the<br>
control unit 80 preferentially turns off the on/off switch SW1 40, and then turns off the<br>
capacitor switch SW2, thereby preventing the switch SW2 or SWl from being<br>
damaged by the inrush current.<br>
 <br>
[148] Fig. 13 is a circuit view illustrating a control apparatus for a linear compressor in<br>
accordance with a seventh embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 13,<br>
the control apparatus for the linear compressor includes a constant power supply unit<br>
66 for receiving external power and converting the power into constant power, a coil<br>
winding body L (identical to the coil winding body 14a of Fig. 2) wound in the circumferential<br>
direction of the linear compressor, for receiving the constant power to<br>
variously vary an inductance, a capacitor C connected in series to the coil winding<br>
body L, for receiving the constant power, a branch means 55 for applying power to the<br>
part or whole of the coil winding body L, and a control unit 90 for controlling the<br>
constant power supply unit 66 and the branch means 55 to adjust a cooling force<br>
according to a load.<br>
[149] In detail, the constant power supply unit 66 receives the external power having<br>
variation possibility, and applies constant power with a predetermined size of constant<br>
voltage, constant power with a predetermined size of constant frequency, or constant<br>
power with a predetermined size of constant voltage and a predetermined size of<br>
constant frequency to the capacitor C and the coil winding body L. The constant power<br>
supply unit 66 can be provided as an electronic circuit using an inverter or a triac.<br>
[150] Here, the size of the constant voltage and the size of the constant frequency are<br>
fixed as single values, respectively, so that the constant power supply unit 66 can<br>
always apply the constant power with the same size of constant voltage and/or constant<br>
frequency. In addition, the constant power supply unit 66 can convert the externally-<br>
applied power into constant power with a different size of constant voltage and/or<br>
constant frequency by the control of the control unit 90. The constant power supply<br>
unit 66 prevents the output from being changed due to variation of the external power<br>
having variation possibility, by applying the oonstant power to the capacitor C and the<br>
coil winding body L, and causes the aforementioned natural output change by automatically<br>
controlling the reciprocation stroke of the piston 6 according to the load (for<br>
example, low load, mid load, high load, overload, etc.). That is, the natural output<br>
change is achieved when the reciprocation stroke of the piston 6 in the low load is<br>
different from the reciprocation stroke of the piston 6 in the overload. Especially, the<br>
piston 6 is preferably reciprocated to the top dead center (TDC) in the overload.<br>
[151] The capacitor C receiving the constant power is connected to one end of the coil<br>
winding body L, and a connection terminal 55c of the branch means 55 is formed at<br>
the other end of the coil winding body L. A connection terminal 55b is connected to a<br>
middle point M (or a branch line of the middle point M) of the coil winding body L.<br>
 <br>
[152] The capacitor C is a constitutional element for determining the circuit operating<br>
frequency f of the control apparatus with the coil winding body L. Here, the sizes of<br>
c<br>
the capacitor C and the coil winding body L must be designed so that the operating<br>
frequency f can be equalized to the natural frequency f in the maximum output (for<br>
c	n<br>
example, the overload operation) of the linear motor 10 (resonant point design). The<br>
natural frequency f is estimated by considering the mechanical spring constant K and<br>
n	m<br>
the gas spring constant K , or by decreasing the mechanical spring constant K and<br>
g	ra<br>
increasing the influence of the gas spring constant K . By this design, in the load<br>
g<br>
requiring the maximum output, the piston 6 of the linear motor 10 is reciprocated to<br>
the TDC of Fig. 2, and in the load below the maximum output, the piston 6 of the<br>
linear motor 10 is reciprocated according to the load.<br>
[153] The branch means 55 includes a switching element 55a connected to the constant<br>
power supply unit 66, for selectively applying the constant power to the connection<br>
terminal 55b or 55c, and the connection terminals 55b and 55c (or winding taps)<br>
connected to the middle point M and the other end of the coil winding body L, respectively,<br>
for applying the constant power to the coil winding body L by connection<br>
to the switching element 55a. The branch means 55 applies the constant power to the<br>
part or whole of the coil winding body L by operating the switching element 55a<br>
according to the selection signal of the control unit 90. Here, two or more connection<br>
terminals 55b and 55c can be provided. At the initial stage, the branch means 55<br>
connects the switching element 55a to the connection terminal 55c.<br>
[154] The control unit 90 preferentially controls the constant power supply unit 66 to<br>
receive the external power, convert the power into a predetermined size of constant<br>
power, and apply the constant power to the capacitor C and the coil winding body L.<br>
Accordingly, the linear motor 10 can automatically change the output of the piston 6<br>
according to the load.<br>
[155] The automatic output change is clearly shown in Fig. 14 which is a cooling capacity<br>
graph of the control apparatus of Fig. 13. The cooling capacity graph shows changes of<br>
the cooling capacity by a load (a temperature, an ambient temperature, etc.), such as a<br>
low load (a), a mid load (b), a high load (c) and an overload (d). Especially, the<br>
cooling capacity has an almost constant size after the overload (d). As described<br>
above, the piston 6 is reciprocated to the TDC in the overload (d), and reciprocated at a<br>
corresponding stroke in the load below the overload (d). In addition to the automatic<br>
output change, even if the external power is varied, since the predetermined size of<br>
constant power is applied, the cooling capacity graph of Fig. 14 is slowly changed to<br>
 <br>
stably drive the cooling cycle. Besides the automatic output change and the stable<br>
cooling cycle, since the circuit operating frequency f of the control apparatus is<br>
c<br>
equalized to the natural frequency f in the maximum output (overload), the piston 6 is<br>
n<br>
reciprocated to the TDC in the maximum output, thereby maximizing cooling<br>
efficiency. In the conventional linear compressor, since the circuit operating frequency<br>
f is equalized to the natural frequency f in the high load output, the cooling capacity<br>
c	n<br>
is reduced in the maximum output (overload).<br>
[156] The control unit 90 can change the cooling capacity according to a requested<br>
output. Here, the requested output means all output variations requested by the cooling<br>
cycle or the user. A first method for changing the cooling capacity controls the<br>
constant power supply unit 66, and a second method for changing the cooling capacity<br>
controls the branch means 55.<br>
[157] The first method for changing the cooling capacity changes the size of the constant<br>
power converted in the constant power supply unit 66. For example, in order to<br>
increase the output, the control unit 90 increases the size of the constant power<br>
converted in the constant power supply unit 66, or decreases the size of the constant<br>
frequency. When the output increases, the graph of Fig. 14 upwardly moves (the<br>
gradient of the graph can be varied). In order to decrease the output, the control unit 90<br>
decreases the size of the constant power converted in the constant power supply unit<br>
66, or increases the size of the constant frequency. When the output decreases, the<br>
graph of Fig. 14 downwardly moves (the gradient of the graph can be varied). On<br>
another occasion, the control unit 90 increases the size of the constant frequency to<br>
increase the output in the initial cooling operation, and decreases the size of the<br>
constant frequency to decrease the output.<br>
[158]	The second method for changing the cooling capacity adjusts the length of the coil<br>
winding body L receiving the constant power, by controlling the branch means 55. The<br>
graph of Fig. 14 is deduced when the switching element 55a of the branch means 55 is<br>
connected to the connection terminal 55c. If the control unit 90 connects the switching<br>
element 55a to the connection terminal 55b by controlling the branch means 55, the<br>
constant power is applied only to the part L1 of the coil winding body L, thereby<br>
decreasing the output. Therefore, the graph of Fig. 14 downwardly moves (the gradient<br>
of the graph can be varied). That is, if the coil winding body L receiving the constant<br>
power is lengthened, the constant power is applied to the whole coil winding body L to<br>
increase the output, and if the coil winding body L receiving the constant power is<br>
shortened, the constant power is applied to the part of the coil winding body L to<br>
 <br>
decrease the output..<br>
[159]	The first and second methods can be individually or cooperatively carried out by<br>
the control unit 90, for embodying various output changes.<br>
[160] As discussed earlier, in accordance with the present invention, the control apparatus<br>
for the linear compressor can control the output by varying the whole capacitance, and<br>
prevent the inrush current.<br>
[161]	The control apparatus for the linear compressor can efficiently prevent the inrush<br>
current by controlling the on/off switch of the linear compressor in variation of the capacitance.<br>
[162]	The linear motor or control apparatus including the plurality of switches can efficiently<br>
prevent the inrush current by controlling the on/off order of the switches.<br>
[163]	The control apparatus for the linear compressor can improve operation reliability by<br>
preventing increase or decrease of the output by variation of the applied power.<br>
[164] The control apparatus for the linear compressor can prevent the linear compressor<br>
from undergoing the overload or performing the abnormal operation due to the excessively-applied<br>
power.<br>
[165]	The control apparatus for the linear compressor can vary the operation of the linear<br>
compressor (high cooling force operation, low cooling force operation, etc.), and<br>
prevent generation of the inrush current.<br>
[166]	The control apparatus for the linear compressor can maximize cooling efficiency by<br>
changing the output according to the load, regardless of variation of the externally-<br>
applied power.<br>
[167] The control apparatus for the linear compressor can generate the plurality of outputs<br>
by changing the size of the constant power applied to the coil according to the<br>
requested output.<br>
[168]	The control apparatus for the linear compressor can generate the plurality of outputs<br>
by changing the size of the constant power and the length of the coil receiving the<br>
constant power.<br>
[169] The control apparatus for the linear compressor can improve the cooling capacity<br>
and cooling efficiency by reciprocating the piston to the TDC in the maximum output,<br>
by using the constant power and the resonant point design in the maximum output.<br>
[170]	The linear compressor including the moving magnet type linear motor, and the<br>
piston connected to the linear motor and linearly reciprocated in the cylinder, for<br>
sucking, compressing and discharging the refrigerants has been explained with<br>
