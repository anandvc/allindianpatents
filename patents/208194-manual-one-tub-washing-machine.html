				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  relates to a  manual one-tub washing machine 5      mounted with a washing-cum-spin-dry tub, and more particularly to a manual one-tub washing machine adapted to independently perform washing, draining and spin-drying with manipulation of a knob.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Generally, a two-tub washing machine according to the prior art is<br>
10      separately mounted at a body 100 thereof with a washing tub 102 and a spin-dry<br>
tub 104. The washing tub 102 is disposed therein with a pulsator 106 while the<br>
pulsator 106 is rotatively connected to a washing motor 110 via a washing axle<br>
108 and power transmission means.<br>
The spin-dry tub 104 is rotatively coupled at an inner side of a tub 112 15      with    a    spin-dry    container    114    while    the    spin-dry    container    114    is circumferentially formed with a plurality of drain holes 116 and is also rotatively connected to a spin-dry motor 120 via a spin-dry axle 118.<br>
A drain outlet 112 formed at a bottom side of the washing tub 102 is coupled with one end of drain hose 124 for washed water discharge after the 20      washing is finished while the other end of the drain hose 124 is connected to a drain case 126 integrally formed with the spin-dry tub 104.<br>
The drain case 126 is connected thereunder to another drain hose 128 for discharging outside of the body 100 the water drained out from the washing<br>
1A<br>
tub 102 and spin-dry tub 104. The body 100 of the washing machine is mounted thereon with a plurality of manipulation knobs 130 for manipulating the washing machine.<br>
In the two-tub washing machine thus constructed according to the prior 5      art, when laundry is put into the washing tub 102, washing water is put thereinto, an appropriate amount of detergent is inserted and the knob 130 is operated, the washing motor 110 is activated to forwardly and reversely rotate the pulsator 106 for washing during the washing operation. When the washing is completed, the washing water  is  repeatedly  put  into the washing tub   102 for rinsing 10     operation.<br>
When  the  rinsing  is  performed  several  times  and  the  knob   130  is<br>
manipulated, a drain valve (not shown) is manually pulled to open the drain<br>
outlet 122 formed underneath the washing tub 102, such that the washing water<br>
polluted is drained outside from the body 100 through the drain hose 124, drain<br>
15      case 126, another drain hose 128.<br>
Thereafter, when the laundry having finished with the rinsing is taken out of the washing tub 102 to be put into the spin-dry container 114 at the spin-dry tub 104 and the knob 130 is manipulated, the spin-dry motor 120 is driven to rotate the spin-dry container 114 to one direction to generate a centrifugal force, 20 by which water contained in the laundry is drained out through the drain holes 116 formed at an inner surface of the spin-dry container 114. The drained water is again drained out of the body 100 through the drain case 126 and the drain hose 128 formed underneath the spin-dry tub 104.<br>
However, there is a problem in the conventional manual two-tub washing<br>
25      machine thus constructed and operated in that the laundry having finished with<br>
the washing/rinsing should be taken out of the washing tub 102 for spin-dry<br>
2<br>
thereof to be again put into the spin-dry tub 104, whereby a large quantity of water container in the laundry is spilt on a floor to thereby make surrounding areas thereof watery and filthy while the laundry is moved from the washing tub 102 to the spin-dry tub 104.<br>
5	There is another problem in that laundry should be divided in the spin-<br>
dry tub 104 for spin-drying even though a large quantity of laundry is washed at one time in the washing tub 102 due to size difference between the spin-dry tub 104 and the washing tub 102. There is still another problem in that size of the washing machine tends to become large in size thereof because the washing tub 10      102 and spin-dry tub 104 are separated.<br>
To overcome the above-mentioned problems, there is currently used a one-tub fully automated washing machine however there is still a further problem in that a microcomputer for controlling all the operations and additional circuit elements, various sensors and the like are needed when the microcomputer is in 15 use to thereby increase the manufacturing cost even though there is provided a comfort in case of use of the fully automated one-tub washing machine.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is disclosed to solve the aforementioned problems and it is an object of the present invention to provide a manually operated one-20 tub washing machine mounted with a washing tub and a spin-dry tub adapted for use in washing, draining and spin-drying each in independent way according to manipulation of a knob to thereby render a comfort in use and to miniaturize the overall size thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a manual one-tub<br>
25     washing machine adapted selectively drive a washing, draining or spin-dry just by<br>
change of switch contact according to manipulation of knob, eliminating use of<br>
3<br>
additional circuit elements unlike a fully-automated washing machine utilizing a microcomputer sensors and the like, thereby enabling a simple circuit construction for reduction of manufacturing cost.<br>

Figures 4 and 5. The lever selection member 6 is circumferntially formed thereon<br>
and thereunder with a  first and a  second protruder 61  and 62,  each at a<br>
10      predetermined    angle   (240   degrees   and    120   degrees,    respectively),   for<br>
connecting to contacts of first and second switches (SW1 and SW2).<br>
Next, a control circuit of a manual one-tub washing machine thus constructed will be described with reference to Figure 7.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 7, the control circuit includes a washing timer 50<br>
15      for changing the contacts to control the washing time according to manipulation<br>
of the washing timer knob 7, a draining/spin-drying timer 55 for changing the<br>
contacts according to manipulation of the draining/spin-drying timer knob 11 to<br>
control the draining/spin-drying time, a lid switch 60 for being turned on or<br>
turned off according to opening and closing of the door 3 during the draining or<br>
20      spin-drying course, a first switch (SW1) for contacting or being detached from<br>
the   second   protruder   62   at   the   lever   selection   member   6   according   to<br>
manipulation of washing/draining/spin-drying selection knob 5 to control the<br>
washing, draining or spin-drying mode, a second switch (SW2) for contacting or<br>
being detached from the first protruder 61 at the lever selection member 6<br>
25     according to manipulation of the washing/draining/spin-drying selection knob 5<br>
to control the draining or spin-drying mode, a drain motor 27 for performing the<br>
draining operation according to switching operation of the first and second<br>
7<br>
switch (SW1 and SW2) when the washing/draining/spin-drying selection knob 5 is manipulated to select the draining/spin-drying, and a washing motor 19 for performing the washing operation according to switching operation of the first and second switches (SW1 and SW2) when the washing/draining/spin-drying 5      selection knob 5 is manipulated to select the washing.<br>
Meanwhile, unexplained reference numeral 65 is a fuse, 67 a starting condenser, 70 a power input terminal.<br>
Now, operational effect of  the manual one-tub washing machine thus constructed will be described.<br>
10	First of all, it is assumed as an initial condition for operably describing<br>
the present invention that the first and second switches (SW1 and SW2) are in normal close state (NC) while the lid switch 60 is in normal open state.<br>
When a user puts laundry water and detergent into the spin-dry tub 7, rotatively manipulates the washing timer knob 7 of the manipulating unit formed 15 at an upper end of the body 1 to set up a washing time and rotatively manipulates the washing/draining/spin-dry selection knob 5 to place same to washing/rinsing position, the lever selection member 6 mounted via the axle 6a at the washing/draining/spin-drying selection knob 5 is also rotated at the same time, as illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
20	Successively, the first and second protruders 61 and 62 formed along the<br>
circumferential surface of the lever selection member 6 simultaneously contact the first and second switches (SW1 and SW2) to press the contacts of the first and second switches (SW1 and SW2), such that the first switch (SW1) is connected to "NO" terminal while the second switch (SW2) is opened.<br>
25	As a result, a closed circuit is formed which is connected by power input<br>
8<br>
terminal 70 ? first switch (SW1) ? washing timer 50? washing motor 19 ??power input terminal 70, thereby starting to activate the washing motor 19, as illustrated in Figure 6a.<br>
When  the  washing  motor  19  is  driven,   turning effect  generated   by<br>
5      activation of the washing motor 19 is transmitted to the power transmission<br>
mechanism 23 via  belt 21, whereby the pulsator  17 is rotated forward and<br>
backward by the turning effect of the washing motor 19 transmitted to the power<br>
transmission mechanism 23 to generate water current to the supplied water.<br>
The water current formed by the rotation of the pulsator  17 applies 10      pressure to the water to separate dirt, foreign objects and the like from the laundry to perform the washing.<br>
When the washing time on the washing timer 50 lapses, an alternating current AC power supplied to the washing motor  19 from the  power input terminal 70 is blocked to stop the washing motor 19 and to thereby finish the 15      washing operation.<br>
When the washing operation is completed, the draining/spin-drying timer<br>
knob 11  is rotatively manipulated to set up the draining time and when the<br>
washing/draining/spin-drying selection knob 5 is rotatively manipulated to place<br>
same at the draining position, as illustrated in Figure 4, the lever selection<br>
20      member 6 installed at the knob 5 via the axle 6a is also rotated.<br>
As a result, as illustrated in Figure 6b, the first protruder 61 at the lever<br>
selection   member  6  contacts  the  second   switch   (SW2)  while  the  second<br>
protruder 62 is detached from the first switch (SW1) to cause the first protruder<br>
61  to  press the  second  switch  (SW2),  such  that the first switch  (SW1)  is<br>
25     connected to "NC" terminal while the second switch (SW2) is opened.<br>
Successively, a closed circuit is formed connecting power input terminal 70?? first switch (SW1)       lid switch 60 ? draining/spin-drying timer 55 -drain motor 27 ? power input terminal 70, to thereby start activating the drain motor 27.<br>
5	When the drain motor 27 is driven, the polluted water in the washing tub<br>
5 is drained out through the drain hose 23, and when the drain timer of the draining/spin-drying timer 55 lapses, the AC power supplied to the drain motor 27 from the power input terminal 70 is blocked to stop the drain motor 27 and to finish the draining operation.<br>
10	Meanwhile, when the user opens the door 3 in the course of draining<br>
operation, the lid switch 60 is rendered inactive to cut off the power from the power input terminal 70 to the drain motor 27, such that the drain motor 27 is stopped to interrupt the draining operation.<br>
After the washing or the draining operation is completed, the 15 draining/spin-drying timer knob 11 is rotatively manipulated to set up the spin-drying time and the washing/draining/spin-drying selection knob 5 is rotatively manipulated to place same at the draining/spin-drying position, as illustrated in Figure 4, the lever selection member 6 provided at the knob 5 via the axle 6a is also rotated at the same time.<br>
20	As a  result, the first and second protruders 61  and 62 at the lever<br>
selection member 6 are detached from the first and second switch (SW1 and SW2), whereby the first switch (SW1) is connected to "NC" terminal and the second switch (SW2) is also connected to "NC" terminal, as illustrated in Figure 6C.<br>
25	Successively,  a closed circuit is formed which  connects power input<br>
terminal (70) ? first switch (SW1) -   lid switch (60) ? draining/spin-drying<br>
10<br>
timer (55) ? drain motor (27) ? power input terminal (70), to thereby drive the drain motor 27 and to start the draining operation. At the same time, another closed circuit is formed which connects power input terminal (70) ??first switch (SW1)  second switch (SW2) ? drain motor (27) ? washing 5     motor (19) ? power input terminal (70), thereby rotating the washing motor 19 to one direction at a high speed and spin-drying the laundry according to the centrifugal force generated therefrom.<br>
At this time, when the spin-drying operation at the draining/spin-drying<br>
timer 55 is completed, the AC power supplied from the power input terminal 70<br>
10     to the drain motor 27 and the washing motor 19 is blocked to thereby stop the<br>
drain motor 27 and the washing motor 19 and to complete the spin-drying<br>
operation.<br>
Meanwhile, when the user opens the door 3 in the course of spin-drying<br>
operation, the lid switch 60 is rendered inactive to cut off the power from the<br>
15      power input terminal 70 to the drain motor 27 and the washing motor 19, such<br>
that the drain motor 27 and the washing motor 19 are stopped to interrupt the<br>
spin-drying operation.<br>
As apparent from the foregoing, there is an advantage in the manual one-tub washing machine according to the present invention thus described in that 20 washing, draining and spin-drying are independently executed according to manipulation of knob in a one-tub washing machine having a washing tub and a spin-drying tub, such that it is comfortable to use, and it is possible to miniaturize the entire size of the washing machine.<br>
There is another advantage in that the washing, draining or the spin-<br>
25      drying operation can be independently executed by way of simple change of<br>
switch contacts according to  knob manipulation, thereby enabling a simple<br>
11<br>
circuit construction without using additional circuit elements unlike the fully automated washing machine which uses a microcomputer, sensor and the like and reducing the manufacturing cost.<br>
