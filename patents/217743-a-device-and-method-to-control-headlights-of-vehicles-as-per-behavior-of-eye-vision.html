				<td>This invention relates to a device and method to control Headlights of vehicles as per behavior of Eye vision, for accurate vision to avoid depriving of sight, pain in the eyes &amp; mental fatigue due to excessive lights and accidents during nighttime.<br>
The background of the invention:<br>
In known art, the upper part of the Headlights are painted black 1O control the incoming light beam from the vehicle coming from the opposite side, but the height of each vehicle and height-wise placing of the Headlights is not equal, therefore this method is not so effective And another method is dipper, it is driver's choice, every one is not using this and also it gives flicker/disturbance to the working mode/continuity of the vision of Human eye, when it is changing from main beam to dipper beam and vice versa The circuit diagram in this invention is very much different from any prior art/patent circuits. All the prior art patents are based on automatically dimming/dipper used, for light of the incoming vehicle increases to certain be specific value, but not taking the human eye concept in to consideration. Patent No.: EPO 541491 is also the dimming system used to dim the light from main beam to lower beam when light of the incoming vehicle increases certain be specific value. The list of Abstracts of the various prior patents is attached, in which only automatic dipper control is there. The automatically changing from main beam to lower beam also gives flicker/disturbance to the working mode/continuity of the vision of Human eye, when it is changing from main beam to dipper beam and vice versa So these methods are just hit and trail solutions to this problem. But in present invention the light of all the bulbs is to be controlled in such a manner taking accommodation of human eye into consideration.<br>
The summary of the invention:<br>
The Human eye is working in different five modes/region as it perceives the illumination as per perceptual capability of human eye The different region of the vision of Human eye, is taking Rel log illumination Vs Perceived Brightness. Rel. Log illumination from-2 to -6 lies in Scotopic region, 2 to 2 lies in Mesopic region, 2 to 7 lies in photopic region in which Iris of human eye operates and perceived brightness is to be 30% to 80 % depends upon accommodation of Human eye, 7 to 8 lies in hyperopic region, greater than 8 lies in Pain region. If we are taking the brightness/illumination of the beam of<br>
vehicle in to consideration, during night times, on the roads, the vehicles comes from opposite sides, may using dipper or not, light increases as vehicles comes close each other at fast relative velocity of the vehicles and light increases when bulbs approaching close to driver's eyes at sharp rate. The change in the light intensity/time-wise and change in the light intensity with change in the distance between eyes and headlights, are very high as the rate of the accommodation mode of human eye at that time and it cannot be accommodated by human eye as fast and as a result depriving of sight takes place. It is further stated that during night times, on the roads, the vehicles comes from opposite sides, may using dipper or not, light increases as vehicles comes close each other at fast relative velocity of the vehicles i.e. sum of the velocities of the vehicles and vehicles are taking few seconds to pass each other. As light from the bulbs of (main beam) incident on the road, a part of that is reflected and perceived by eyes as the information or wanted component of the light (SI) to produce the image of the road/vehicles/other things on the road, on the retina of Human eye. In this condition, eye is operating under the mode in which the Iris of eye operates. When other vehicles approaching from the opposite side, unwanted light (Ul) from that vehicle is get mixed with wanted component of light (SI) and resultant light increases as vehicles approaching each other at fast relative velocity of the vehicles. As a result unwanted light (Ul) overcomes the wanted component (SI), ratio SI/UI goes very low and Ul also goes to photoreceptor saturation level, due to this depriving of sight takes place. The Human eye cannot accommodate by Iris control as fast as light changes. Light goes to post photoreceptor saturation level, under these conditions the depriving of sight takes place. The change in the light also goes to hyperopic region and in the pain region due to these excessive lights, the mental fatigue and pain in the eyes occurs. Most of the accidents occur due to the depriving of sight in this transition period, when two vehicles passing each other or slightly after that, mostly any trespasser, cyclist or any other thing on the road, is not visible To avoid this, the lights from both the vehicles are to be controlled with distance-wise and kept whole control taking into consideration of the accommodation of the human eyes in to account to maximize the vision/clearance of the road to avoid the depriving of sight, pain in eyes, mental fatigue and accidents during night time. Control means for automatically adjusting the Headlights of the vehicles distance-wise as per behavior of Human Eye vision, for accurate vision to avoid depriving of sight, pain in the eyes &amp; mental fatigue due to excessive lights and accidents during nighttime.In Towns and Cities, during night times where the streetlights are provided, full beam main beam is not required, so that new beam is developed for this type of situation for accurate vision.<br>
The object of the invention:<br>
The object of this invention is to devise a device for obviating the abo\e said defects and a device to control Headlights of Vehicles in affective way as per behavior of Eye vision, for accurate v lsion to avoid depriving of sight, pain in eyes &amp; mental fatigue due to excessive lights and accidents due to depriving of sight during night time, comprising Sensing unit S means, sensing elements used to continuously sense the light distance-wise of the incoming vehicle in the opposite direction to the vehicle going in opposite to it Resistance network RI for ad|ustment of required resistance component in series with each sensing element,Resistance network R2 for adjustment of required resistance component for street lighted roads Two way Switch SW with two modes,Control unit C means, which will accept the \anation in the parameters of the said Sensing unit S and produces the switching signal applied to the Driver circuit DRC Driver circuit DRC means, which provides the isolation and driving signal to switching components of Power circuit P,Power circuit P means, the switching component switches as per receives control signal from Control unit C via Driver circuit DRC and Power from the Alternator &amp; Batters, to control the voltage/current across the Bulbs (BL &amp; BR) as per required for accurate vision,Connector means different connecting wires to connect different units<br>
