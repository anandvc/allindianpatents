RELATED APPLICATION INFORMATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority, under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e), from U.S. provisional patent application serial No. 60/469,451, filed 9 May 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies directed to CD20 and methods of making and using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
B lymphocytes are the origin of humoral immunity, represent a substantial portion of hematopoietic malignancies, and contribute to autoimmunity. Consequently, cell surface molecules expressed by B cells and their malignant counterparts are important targets for immunotherapy. CD20, a B cell-specific member of the MS4A gene family, is expressed on the surface of immature and mature B cells and their malignant counterparts (Tedder and Engel (1994) Immunol. Today 15:450-454).<br>
A limited analysis of CD20 transcripts in mouse cell lines and tissues suggests that mouse CD20 is also B cell-specific (Tedder, et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 141:4388). Both human and mouse CD20 cDNAs encode a membrane-embedded protein with hydrophobic regions of sufficient length to pass through the membrane four times (Tedder, et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 141:4388; Tedder, et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85:208; Einfeld, et al. (1988) EMBOJ. 7:711; Stamenkovic and Seed (1988) J. Exp. Med. 167:1975). Mouse and human CD20 are well conserved (73%) in amino acid sequence, particularly the transmembrane and long amino- and carb<br><br>
terminal cytoplasmic domains (Tedder, et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 141:4388). The cytoplasmic domains are serine- and threonine-rich with multiple consensus sequences for phosphorylation. Human CD20 is not glycosylated, but three isoforms (33-, 35- and 37,000 Mr) result from the differential<br>
phosphorylation of a single protein on different serine and threonine residues (Tedder, et al. (1988) Molec. Immunol. 25:1321; Tedder and Schlossman (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:10009; Valentine, et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:8085).<br>
CD20 plays a role in the regulation of human B cell activation, proliferation and Ca2+transport (Tedder, et al.'(1985) J. Immunol. 135:973; Bubien, et al. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 121:1121). Antibody ligation of CD20 can generate transmembrane signals that result in enhanced CD20 phosphorylation (Tedder and Schlossman (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:10009), induction of c-myc and B-myb oncogene expression (Smeland, et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82:6255; Golay, et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 149:300), induced serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Deans, et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:4494), increased CD18, CD58 and MHC class II molecule expression (White, et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 146:846; Clark and Shu (1987) J. Immunol. 138:720), and protein tyrosine kinase activation that induces B cell adhesion (Kansas and Tedder (1991) J. Immunol. 147:4094). CD20 Hgation promotes transmembrane Ca2* transport (Bubien, et al. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 121:1121), but does not usually lead to increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]j)3 levels (Bubien, et al. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 121:1121; Tedder, etal. (1986) Eur. J. Immunol. 16:881; Golay, etal.<br>
(1985)	J. Immunol. 135:3795), except after extensive crosslinking (Deans, et<br>
al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:4494). Antibody binding to CD20 inhibits B cell<br>
progression from the GI phase into the S/G2+M stages of cell cycle following<br>
mitogen stimulation, and inhibits mitogen-induced B cell differentiation and<br>
antibody secretion (Tedder, et al. (1985) J. Immunol. 135:973; Tedder, et al.<br>
(1986)	Eur. J. Immunol. 16; Golay, el al. (1985) J. Immunol. 135:3795; Golay<br>
and Crawford (1987) Immunology 62:279). Extensive CD20 cross-linking can<br>
aiso influence apoptosis (Holder, et al. (1995) Eur. J. Immunol. 25:3160;<br>
Shan, et al. (1998) Blood 91:1644). These divergent observations may be<br><br>
explained in part by the finding that CD20 is a component of an oligomeric complex that forms a membrane transporter or Ca2+ ion channel that is activated during cell cycle progression (Bubien, et al. (1993) J. CellBiol. 121:1121; Kanzaki, et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270:13099; Kanzaki, et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272:14733; Kanzaki, et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272:4964). Despite this, B cell development and function in a line of CD20-<br>
deficient (CD20-/-) mice is reported to be normal (O'Keefe, et al. (1998) Immunogenetics 48:125).<br>
The majority of human B cell-lineage malignancies express CD20 (Anderson, et al. (1984) Blood 63:1424). Chimeric or radiolabeled monoclonal antibody-based therapies directed against CD20 have been used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Press, et al. (2001) Hemafo/ogy:221-240; Kaminski, et al. (1993) N. Engl. J. Med. 329:459-465; Weiner (1999) Semin. Oncol. 26:43-51; Onrust, et al. (1999) Drugs 58:79-88; Mclaughlin, et al. (1998) Oncology 12:1763-1769). Clinical studies indicate that anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy also ameliorates the manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic anemia, as well as other immune-mediated diseases (Silverman and Weisman (2002) Arthritis Rheum. 48:1484-1492; Edwards and Cambridge (2001) Rheumatology 40:1-7).<br>
Competing hypotheses are employed to explain the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in vivo. In one model, CD20 serves as a membrane-embedded target for monoclonal antibody-mediated depletion of B cells through activation of the innate immune system or the initiation of effector mechanisms (Reff, et al. (1994) Blood 83:435-445; Maloney, et al. (1997) Blood 90:2188-2195; Maloney, et al. (1997) J. Clin. Oncol. 15:3266-3274).<br>
Rituximab, a chimeric human lgG1 anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibody is highly effective in inducing classical pathway complement (C) activation and C-dependent cytotoxicity of freshly isolated lymphoma cells and B cell lines (Reff, et al. (1994) Blood 83:435-445; Golay, et al. (2001) Blood 98:3383-3389; Cragg, et al. (2003) Blood 101:1045-1052; Di Gaetano, etal, (2003) J. Immunol. 171:1581-1587; Bellosillo, et al. (2001) 6Blood 98:2771-2777). Rituximab also activates C in vivo in both patients (van der Kolk, et al.<br><br>
(2001) Br. J. Hemato/. 115:807-811) and primates (Kennedy, et al. (2003) Blood 101:1071-1079). Furthermore, tumor cell expression of C regulatory proteins, including CD59, is associated with resistance to anti-CD20 therapy (Golay, et al. (2001) Blood 98:3383-3389; Treon, et al. (2001) J. Immunotherapy 24:263-271). Although many consider C-dependent cytotoxicity to be the major pathway used by Rituximab antibody to deplete human lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo (Golay, et al. (2001) Blood 98:3383-3389; Cragg, et al. (2003) Blood 101:1045-1052; Di Gaetano, et al. (2003) J. Immunol. 171:1581-1587; Golay, et al. (2000) B/ood 95:3900-3908; Di Gaetano, et al. (2001) Br. J. Hemato/. 114:800-809; Weiner (2003) Blood 101:788), others have found that the susceptibility of tumor cells to C-mediated lysis and expression of C inhibitors CD46, CD55, and CD59 on tumor cells does not predict the outcome of Rituximab therapy (Weng and Levy (2001) Blood 98:1352-1357). Other antibody-dependent effects also appear important since a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody of an isotype different than that used clinically does not deplete normal B cells in non-human primates (Anderson, et al. (1997) Biochem. Soc. Transac. 25:705-708) and the anti-tumor effect of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody depends in part on immune activation through Fc receptors (FcyR) for IgG (Clynes, et al. (2000) Nature Med. 6:443-446). Alternatively, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment alters transmembrane Ca2+ transport and B cell function, which disrupts progression through cell cycle (Tedder and Engel (1994) Immunol. Today 15:450-454) and can induce B cell apoptosis (Shan, et al. (1998) B/ooo 91:1644-1652; Demidem, etal. (1997) Cancer Biother. Radiopharm. 12:177-186).<br>
It is difficult to differentiate between these hypotheses in vivo due to the complexities of carrying out mechanistic studies in humans undergoing irnmunotherapy (Edwards and Cambridge (2001) Rheumatology 40:1-7). Moreover, human studies primarily focus on changes in blood, which contains 
Needed in the art are improved reagents and methods for altering B cell function, in particular in B cell disorders such as B cell malignancies and<br><br>
autoimmune diseases. Also needed are new anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies with different immunoreactive characteristics than conventional monoclonal antibodies directed against CD20.<br>

For comparative purposes, three mouse anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibodies, HB20-03, -04 and -25 monoclonal antibodies are shown. Relative horizontal tree branch length is a measure of sequence relatedness. For example, the heavy and light chains of the known mouse anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibodies are more similar to each other than they are to the sequences of the HB20-03, -04 and -25 monoclonal antibodies, which are most similar to each other. In the third panel, the heavy and light chain sequences were joined to form a contiguous H+L chain sequence prior to sequence analysis. This analysis shows that the combination of heavy and light chains are not related between the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and the HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based in part on the production of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically bind to human CD20 that have distinct binding properties and other characteristics as compared with conventional anti-CD20 mAbs (e.g., 1F5 or 2B8). In particular, the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments of the invention can be distinguished from conventional anti-CD20 antibodies on a molecular level, for example, by the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the light and/or heavy chain variable regions or particular segments of the variable regions such as the complementarity determining regions ("CDRs").<br>
In particular embodiments, the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments of the invention can bind to B cells at a higher density than conventional mAbs, which property is advantageous for methods of depleting B cells, for therapeutic or diagnostic methods, or for use as a laboratory reagent (for example, to identify B cells or to purify B cells).<br>
The invention also provides mAbs and antigen binding fragments thereof that specifically bind to mouse CD20.<br>
Further provided are anti-CD20 mAbs that are generated from antibody producing cells (e.g., B cells) isolated from a CD20"'" mammal (e.g., a mouse).<br>

CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (Green Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York).<br>
Anti-CD20 mAbs. Antigen-Binding Fragments and Cell Lines.<br>
As one aspect, the invention provides mAbs and antigen-binding fragments thereof that specifically bind to CD20. As used herein the terms "mAb that specifically binds to CD20" and "anti-CD20 mAb" and similar language are interchangeable. In particular embodiments, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment specifically binds to human CD20 and/or mouse CD20. The mAb or antigen-binding fragment can bind to any region of the CD20 protein, but in representative embodiments, binds to an extracellular region of CD20.<br>
The term "antibody" or "antibody molecule" in the various grammatical forms as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule (including IgG, IgE, IgA. IgM, IgD) and/or immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antibody combining site or paratope<br><br>
and can bind antigen. An "antibody combining site" or "antigen binding site" is that structural portion of an antibody molecule comprised of heavy and light chain variable and hypervariable (CDR) regions that specifically binds antigen. As is known in the art, particular properties of antibodies relate to immunoglobulin isotype. In representative embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment is an lgG2a, an lgG1 or an lgG2b isotype molecule. The antibody or fragment can further be from any species of origin including avian (e.g., chicken, turkey, duck, geese, quail, etc.) and mammalian (e.g.,<br><br>
human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, rabbit, cattle, goat, sheep, horse, pig,<br><br>
dog, cat, etc.) species.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" or "mAb" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogenous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for the possibility of naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. mAbs are highly specific and are directed against a single antigenic determinant (i.e., epitope) on the antigen. This characteristic contrasts with polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include antibodies directed against different antigenic determinants.<br>
The terms "antibody" and "mAb" are used here in the broadest sense and specifically covers multispecific antibodies (e.g., bi-specific antibodies), naked antibodies, antibody conjugates, and antibody fragments as long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Further, the terms "antibody" and "mAb" encompass intact (i.e., complete) immunoglobulin molecules or an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody that contains the paratope, including Fab, Fab1, F(ab')2 and Fv fragments, diabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.<br>
Single-chain Fv or "sFv" antibody fragments comprise the antibody heavy and light chain variable domains, where these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the heavy chain variable and light chain variable regions, which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun, The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 133, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag,<br><br>
New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). The production of single chain antibodies has been described in the art, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,203, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In one exemplary method of producing a single chain antibody, combinatorial immunoglobulin phagemid libraries are prepared from RNA isolated from the spleen of an immunized animal, and phagemids expressing appropriate antibodies are selected by panning on endothelial tissue. The advantages of this approach over conventional hybridoma techniques are that approximately 104 times as many antibodies can be produced and screened in a single round, and that new specificities are generated by H and L chain combination in a single chain, which further increases the chance of finding appropriate antibodies.<br>
The term "diabodies" refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain connected to a light chain variable domain in the same polypeptide chain. By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are known in the art, see e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161: and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci90:6444-6448 (1993).<br>
The expression "linear antibodies" as used herein refers to antibodies comprising a pair of tandem Fd segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) that form a pair of antigen binding sites. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific and are described in more detail in Zapata et al., Protein Eng. 8:1057-1062 (1995).<br>
Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods 24:107-117 (1992) and Brennan et al., Science 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant nucleic acid technology in transformed host cells. For example, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. co//and chemically coupled to form F(ab')2 fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). Alternatively, the F(ab')2 is formed using the leucine zipper GCN4 to promote assembly of the F(ab')2 molecule. According to another approach, Fv, Fab or<br><br>
F(ab')2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.<br>
Exemplary mAbs of the present invention include HB20-1, HB20-2, HB20-3, HB20-4, HB20-5, HB20-6, HB20-25, MB20-1, MB20-2, MB20-3, MB20-6, MB20-7, MB20-8, MB20-10, MB20-11, MB20-13, MB20-14, MB20-16 and MB20-18 as disclosed herein. HB20-1, HB20-2, HB20-3, HB20-4, HB20-5 and HB20-6 have previously been designated as HB13a, HB13b, HB13c, HB13d, HB13e and HB13f,'respectively.<br>
The invention further encompasses functional equivalents of the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments specifically disclosed herein that have substantially similar nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequences of the heavy chain, light chain, heavy chain variable region, light chain variable region and/or CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 regions (as described in more detail below) as compared with the corresponding chain or region of an antibody specifically described herein and specifically bind to CD20, and optionally exhibit one or more of the other functional properties of the antibodies and antibody fragments specifically described herein (e.g., density of binding, efficacy of B cell depletion). In one illustrative embodiment, the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments of the invention bind to the same antigenic determinant (i.e., epitoin-} as the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments specifically described herein.<br>
It is routine for those skilled in the art to determine, without undue experimentation, whether an antibody has the specificity of a mAb disclosed herein by epitope mapping. For example, the nucleic acid and/or amino resequence can be determined of one or more of the heavy and/or light chain CDR region(s) or the heavy and/or light chain variable region(s) of the antibodies in question. Antibody molecules having identical, orfunctionally equivalent, amino acid residue sequences in these regions have the same c-similar binding specificity. Methods of assessing and comparing the similar:, of the variable and CDR regions to determine functional equivalency are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Another method of determining whether a monoclonal antibody ha - r--:*. same specificity as an antibody described herein is by comparison of the antibody paratope three-dimensional structures as predicted by computer<br><br>
modeling based on amino acid sequence. An epitope-antibody paratope interaction typically involves four forces: van der Waal's forces (dipole-dipole interactions), hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic (coulombic bonding. Non-covalent binding stabilizes the antibody-antigen complex and holds it together. The interaction is determined by the 3D structure of both molecules. Therefore, a prediction of the 3D structure of the antibody paratope, epitope, and/or epitope-antibody paratope complex permits immunospecificity comparison to other antibodies.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition, epitope mapping can be performed by using a technique based on fragmentation of the antigen to which the antibody binds, either randomly or by specific genetic construction, and determining the reactivity of the fragments obtained with the antibody. Fragmentation can also be performed on the nucleic acid level, for example by PCR technique, followed by transcription and translation into protein in vitro in the presence of radioactive amino acids. For further details see, for example, Hartow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1999, pp. 390-392.<br>
According to a further method of epitope mapping, a set of overlapping peptides is synthesized, each corresponding to a small linear segment of the protein antigen, and arrayed on a solid phase. The panel of peptides is then probed with the test antibody, and bound antibody is detected using an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody. (Harlow and Lane, supra, pp. 393-396<br>
An additional method well known in the art for epitope mapping is antibody selection from a random synthetic or a phage display peptide library For example, phage display libraries can be constructed by cloning complex mixtures of peptide-encoding oligonucleotides into the amino terminus of the minor coat protein gene of the f1-type ssDNA phage. Such phage display libraries are commercially available, for example, from New England Biolabs The libraries can be amplified as stocks, and then an aliquot sufficient to represent multiple copies of each independent clone is mixed with the antibody of interest. Antibody-bound phage are collected by a procedure called "biopanning," and unbound phage are removed. The bound phage a-r eluted and used to infect bacteria, and the selected stock is amplified.<br><br>
Individual plaques of the final selected stock are grown and checked for specific antibody reactivity, e.g. by ELISA, and the DNA around the insert site is sequenced. Analysis of the sequence encoding the peptide to which the antibody binds defines the specificity of the antibody. For further details see. e.g., Smith and Scott, Methods Enzymol. 217:228-257 (1993), and Harlow and Lane, supra, pp. 397-398.<br>
Another, albeit less reliable, way to determine if a mAb has the same specificity as a mAb described herein is by ascertaining whether the former prevents the latter from binding to the target molecule (e.g., CD20). If the mAb being tested competes with a mAb as described herein, as shown by a decrease in binding by the mAb in standard competition assays for binding to the target molecule, then it is possible that the two mAbs bind to the same, or a closely related, epitope. However, this is not a definitive test. The actual epitopes to which the tested mAb and the mAbs disclosed herein bind may still be different, even though the tested antibody is capable of decreasing binding to the target molecule by an antibody disclosed herein. For example, binding by the test mAb to its antigenic determinant can mask the antigenic determinant of a mAb antibody described herein and prevent its binding simply due to the physical bulk of the test mAb, rather than by binding the same epitope. Therefore, more precise procedures (e.g., amino acid sequencing of the variable region and 3D modeling) are often employed in conjunction with competition methods to confirm specificity.<br>
Still another way to determine whether a mAb might have the specificity of a mAb described herein is to pre-incubate a mAb disclosed herein with the target molecule (e.g., CD20), and then add the mAb being tested to determine if the mAb being tested is inhibited in its ability to bind the target. If the mAb being tested is inhibited then it is possible that it has the same, or functionally equivalent, epitope specificity as the mAb disclosed herein. However, this procedure is subject to the same limitations as the competition studies discussed above, and as such, is not necessarily determinative of identical specificity.<br>
In particular embodiments of the invention, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds to CD20, wherein the density of binding of the mAb or antigen-binding fragment to CD20 and/or B cells is at least about 30%.<br><br>
40%, 50%, 60%', 75%, 85%, two-fold, three-fold, four-fold or even five-fold or greater than binding of conventional anti-CD20 mAbs (e.g., 2H7, B9E9,1H4, 2B8, 1F5 and/or Leu-16 antibodies) to CD20 and/or B cells. In addition, the mAbs of the invention can be more therapeutically effecting in depleting malignant B cells that express CD20 at lower densities. These conventional antibodies are available to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., Shan, et al. (1999) J. Immunol. 162:6589-6595; Schultz, et al. (2000) Cancer Res. 60:6663-6669; and Haisma, et al. (1998) Blood 92:184-190; Stashenko, et al. (1980) J. Immunol. 125:1678). While not wishing to be limited by any particular theory of the invention, the density of antibody binding can be attributable to the accessibility or availability of the epitopes bound by the antibody. Thus, according to this embodiment, it appears that the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention are directed against epitopes that have increased accessibility on the cell surface as compared with one or more of the conventional antibodies described above. The antibodies and antigen-binding fragments according to this embodiment of the invention are advantageous for therapeutic applications because they can induce B cell depletion at lower dosages than conventional antibodies. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that degree of enhancement in the density of binding as compared with conventional antibodies can vary according to the target, e.g., the cell line used. In one illustrative embodiment, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment upregulates the binding sites (i.e., accessibility of the epitope) on B cells, which results in a higher density of binding of the mAb or antigen-binding fragment to the B cells and/or their malignant counterparts.<br>
Methods of determining the density of antibody binding to cells are known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sato et al., J. Immunology 165:6635-6643 (2000); which discloses a method of assessing cell surface density of CD 19). Other standard methods include Scatchard analysis. For example, the antibody or fragment can be isolated, radiolabeled, and the specific activity of the radiolabeled antibody determined. The antibody is then contacted with a target cell expressing CD20. The radioactivity associated with the cell can be measured and, based on the specific activity, the amount of antibody or antibody fragment bound to the cell determined.<br><br>
Alternatively, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis can be empbyed. Generally, the antibody or antibody fragment is bound to a target cell expressing CD20. A second reagent that binds to the antibody is then added, for example, a flourochrome labeled anti-immunoglobulin antibody. Flourochrome staining can then be measured and used to determine the density of antibody or antibody fragment binding to the cell.<br>
As another suitable method, the antibody or antibody fragment can be directly labeled with a detectable label, such as a fluorophore, and bound to a<br>
_.-*<br>
target cell. The ratio of label to protein is determined and compared with<br><br>
standard beads with known amounts of label bound thereto. Comparison of the amount of label bound to the cell with the known standards can be used to calculate the amount of antibody bound to the cell.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the functionally equivalent antibody or fragment has the same or a similar efficacy for depleting 6 cells and/or treating a B cell disorder as an antibody or fragment described nerein. This aspect of the invention is described in more detail below. To illustrate, in representative embodiments, a functionally equivalent antibody or fragment achieves at least about a 25%, 35%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 98% or more depletion in circulating and/or tissue B cells for at least about 5, 7,14, 21, 30,45, 60,120 or 180 days or longer at a dosage of about 125 mg/m2,75 mg/m2, 37.5 mg/m2,10 mg/m2, 3.75 mg/m2,1 mg/m2, 0.75 mg/m2, 0.375 mg/m2, 0.1 mg/m2, 0.05 mg/m2, 0.001 mg/m2, 0.0005 mg/m2 or less. Other particular dosages, degree of depletion, and depletion times are described in more detail below.<br>
In representative embodiments of the invention, a mAb or antigen-binding fragment of the invention comprises a heavy chain or light chain of a mAb as described herein. In other exemplary embodiments, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment of the invention comprises a heavy chain variable region and/or a light chain variable region from a mAb as described herein. In still other embodiments, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment comprises a heavy chain V and/or D and/or J region and/or a light chain V and/or J region from a mAb disclosed herein. In still other representative embodiments, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment comprises a heavy chain CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or CDR3 region and/or a light chain CDR1 and/or CDR2 and/or CDR3 region of a mAb<br><br>
described herein. According to this embodiment, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment can comprise the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 regions (heavy and light chain) from a mAb as described herein.<br>
In particular embodiments, the anti-human CD20 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof specifically bind to CD20 and have a heavy chain CDR3 region comprising the amino acid sequence of FYXYXXX1YGAX2XXY, wherein X can be any amino acid, and wherein X1 can be any amino acid and is preferably a Y or an S, and wherein X2can be any amino acid and is preferably an M or an L and wherein F is a Phenylalanine, Y is a Tyrosine, G is a Glycine, A is an Alanine, M is a Methionine, L is a Leucine and S is a Serine. The CDRs are defined as shown in Figures 15 and 18.<br>
In certain embodiments, the anti-human CD20 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof further comprise a heavy chain CDR1 region comprising the amino acid sequence NXXXX wherein X can be any amino acid and N is Asparagine.<br>
In another embodiment, the anti-human anti-CD20 antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof further comprise a light chain CDRS region comprising the amino sequence of XHFWXX3XWX, wherein X can be any arnino acid sequence, H is a Histidine, F is a Phenylalanine, W is a Tryptophan and X3 can be any amino acid and is preferably a T or an I, wherein T is Threonine and I is Isoleucine.<br>
Further, the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments of the invention encompass those that have substantial sequence similarity, for example, at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or more amino acid sequence similarity with the amino acid sequences specified above (e.g., the heavy or light chain, heavy and/or light chain variable region, V, D, and/or J regions or CDR(s)). Alternatively, the nucleic acids encoding these regions have at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or more nucleotide sequence similarity with the nucleotide sequences of the corresponding regions of the antibodies described herein.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain modifications can be made to the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein within the scope of the invention. For example, the sequences can be modified as a result of cloning or amplification procedures or other laboratory manipulations of the<br><br>
nucteic acid or protein molecules, to provide an enhanced affinity and/or density of binding to CD20 and/or B cells, and/or to enhance interactions with Fc receptors.<br>
In particular embodiments, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment (a) comprises a heavy chain comprising the heavy chain variable region of a mAb specifically disclosed herein or a heavy chain variable region that has substantial amino acid sequence similarity (as described above) with the amino acid sequence of a heavy chain variable region of a mAb specifically disclosed herein; (b) comprises a light chain comprising the light chain variable region of a mAb disclosed herein or a light chain variable region that has substantial amino acid sequence similarity with the amino acid sequence of light chain variable region of a mAb specifically disclosed herein; or (c) a mAb or antigen-binding fragment comprising a heavy chain and a light chain according to (a) and (b) above. In particular embodiments, a mAb or antigen-binding fragment of the invention comprises both a heavy chain comprising the heavy chain variable region of a mAb specifically disclosed herein or a heavy chain variable region that has substantial amino acid sequence similarity therewith and, further, a light chain comprising a light chain variable region from the same mAb disclosed herein or a light chain variable region that has substantial amino acid sequence similarity therewith.<br>
As is known in the art, a number of different programs can be used to identify whether a nucleic acid or polypeptide has sequence identity or similarity to a known sequence. Sequence identity and/or similarity can be determined using standard techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, the local sequence identity algorithm of Smith &amp; Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2, 482 (1981), by the sequence identity alignment algorithm of Needleman &amp; Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48,443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson &amp; Lipman, Proc. A/a//. Acad. Sci. USA 85,2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wl), the Best Fit sequence program described by Devereux ef a/., Nucl. Acid Res. 12, 387-395 (1984), preferably using the default settings, or by inspection.<br><br>
An example of a useful algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments. It can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive a4ignment method of Feng &amp; Doolittle, J. Mol. Evol. 35, 351-360 (1987); the method is similar to that described by Higgins &amp; Sharp, CABIOS 5, 151-153 (1989).<br>
Another example of a useful algorithm is the BLAST algorithm, described in Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215, 403-410, (1990) and Karlin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 5873-5787 (1993). A particularly useful BLAST program is the WU-BLAST-2 program, which was obtained from Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymology, 266,460-480 (1996). WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters, which are preferably set to the default values. The parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched, however, the values can be adjusted to increase sensitivity.<br>
An additional useful algorithm is gapped BLAST as reported by Altschul et al., (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25, 3389-3402.<br>
A percentage amino acid sequence identity value can be determined by the number of matching identical residues divided by the total number of residues of the "longer" sequence in the aligned region. The "longer" sequence is the one having the most actual residues in the aligned region (gaps introduced by WU-Blast-2 to maximize the alignment score are ignored).<br>
The alignment can include the introduction of gaps in the sequences to be aligned. In addition, for sequences which contain either more or fewer amino acids than the polypeptides specifically disclosed herein, it is understood that in one embodiment, the percentage of sequence identity will be determined based on the number of identical amino acids in relation to the total number of amino acids. Thus, for example, sequence identity of sequences shorter than a sequence specifically disclosed herein, will be determined using the number of amino acids in the shorter sequence, in one<br><br>
embodiment. In percent identity calculations relative weight is not assigned to various manifestations of sequence variation, such as, insertions, deletions, substitutions, etc.<br>
In one embodiment, only identities are scored positively (+1) and all forms of sequence variation including gaps are assigned a value of "0", which obviates the need for a weighted scale or parameters as described below for sequence similarity calculations. Percent sequence identity can be calculated, for example, by dividing the number of matching identical residues by the total number of residues of the "shorter" sequence in the aligned region and multiplying by 100. The "longer" sequence is the one having the most actual residues in the aligned region.<br>
In other embodiments, a mAb, antigen-binding fragment, or specified region thereof having "substantial sequence similarity" to a mAb or corresponding antigen-binding fragment or specified region specifically described herein is encoded by a nucleic acid that hybridizes to the corresponding segment of the nucleic acids specifically disclosed herein under standard conditions as known by those skilled in the art and encode a functionally equivalent mAb or antigen-binding fragment as defined herein.<br>
To illustrate, hybridization of such nucleic acid sequences can be carried out under conditions of reduced stringency, medium stringency or even stringent conditions (e.g., conditions represented by a wash stringency of 35-40% Formamide with 5x Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS and 1x SSPE at 37ยฐC; conditions represented by a wash stringency of 40-45% Formamide with 5x Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 1x SSPE at 42ยฐC; and/or conditions represented by a wash stringency of 50% Formamide with 5x Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS and 1x SSPE at 42ยฐC, respectively) to the sequences specifically disclosed herein. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2d Ed. 1989) (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory).<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that there can be variability in the nucleic acids that encode the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments of the present invention due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. The degeneracy of the genetic code, which allows different nucleic acid sequences to code for the same polypeptide, is well known in the art.<br><br>
Further variation in the nucleic acid sequence can be introduced by the presence (or absence) of non-translated sequences, such as intronic sequences and 5' and 3' untranslated sequences.<br>
Now that the inventors have produced and characterized a panel of anti-CD20 mAbs having desirable characteristics, it would be routine for those skilled in the art to produce similar or improved antibodies and fragments. For example, the sequences of the heavy and/or light chain variable regions (or portions thereof, such as one or more of the CDRs) can be used as a starting point for the identification of other antibodies with desired properties. As one approach, a phage library can be generated that comprises variants of the sequences disclosed herein. The phage library can be selected on the basis of any desirable characteristic, e.g., CD20 reactivity, density of binding, efficacy of B cell depletion, efficacy of treating a B cell disorder, and the like.<br>
Furthermore, to modify the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of the mAbs and antigen-binding fragments thereof specifically disclosed herein, amino acid substitutions can be based on any characteristic known in the art, including the relative similarity or differences of the amino acid side-chain substituents, for example, their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and the like. In particular embodiments, conservative substitutions are made in the amino acid sequence. As used herein, a "conservative amino acid substitution" is a substitution whose probability of occurring in nature is greater than about ten times the probability of that substitution occurring by chance (e.g., as defined by the computational methods described by Dayhoff et al., Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, 1971, pages 95-96 and Figures 9-10).<br>
In making amino acid substitutions, the hydropathic index of amino acids can be considered. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biologic function on a protein is generally understood in the art (see, Kyte and Doolittle, (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157:105; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). It is accepted that the relative hydropathic character of the amino acid contributes to the secondary structure of the resultant protein, which in turn defines the interaction of the protein with other molecules, for example, enzymes, substrates, receptors, DNA, antibodies, antigens, and the like.<br><br>
Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics (Kyte and Doolittle, Id.), and these are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); praline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5); aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).<br>
It is also understood in the art that the substitution of amino acids can be made on the basis of hydrophilicity. U.S. Patent No. 4,554,101"* (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety)' states that the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the protein.<br>
As detailed in U.S. Patent No. 4,554,101, the following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (ยฑ3.0); aspartate (+3.0 ยฑ 1); glutamate (+3.0 ยฑ1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5 ยฑ I); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5); tryptophan (-3.4).<br>
In other embodiments, functionally equivalent mAbs and antigen binding fragments of the invention encompass those comprising one or more of the specified regions above (e.g., heavy or light chains, heavy and/or light chain variable regions or portions thereof) from the mAbs or antigen-binding fragments disclosed herein having no more than 14,12,10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions. In particular embodiments, a mAb or antigen-binding fragment of the invention comprises a CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 region, wherein each CDR region comprises no more than 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions. In an exemplary embodiment, the CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 region each comprises no more than 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 conservative amino acid substitutions.<br>
The antibodies or fragments can additionally have more than one antigen specificity, e.g., can be a bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody can, for example, additionally bind to another CD20 epitope. In addition, the bispecific antibody can have binding specificity for other antigens, such as, CD19, CD22, CD52, CDS, CD28, or HLA-DR10 (Lym-1); or for Fc receptors.<br><br>
e.g. CD16, CD84 and CD89; T cell receptors (e.g., the zeta chain of the T cell receptor complex) or for other cell surface molecules such as receptors such as cytokine. hormone or growth factor rccoptors.<br>
The antibodies and fragments thereof can further be a "chimeric" antibody. Chimeric antibodies and antigen-binding fragments comprise portions from two or more different species (e.g., mouse and human). Chimeric antibodies can be produced with mouse variable regions of desired specificity spliced into human constant domain gene segments (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). In this manner, non-human (e.g., mouse) antibodies can be modified to make them more suitable for human clinical application.<br>
The mAbs of the invention can further be "humanized" or "CDR ! grafted" forms of non-human (e.g., mouse) mAbs, which can offer advantages ; as therapeutic agents for humans over murine mAbs, particularly because i they are not cleared from the circulation in humans as rapidly as mouse I antibodies, and do not generally provoke an adverse immune reaction when (administered to human subjects. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or (more amino acid residues introduced into it from a non-human source. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, Vvhich are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. Methods of preparing humanized antibodies are generally well known in the art, and can ifeadily be applied to the mAbs disclosed herein. For example, humanization (Jan be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (ijones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a hpman antibody. In particular embodiments, humanized forms of non-human (ai.g., mouse) antibodies are human antibodies (recipient antibody) in which h^pervariable (CDR) region residues of the recipient antibody are replaced by h^pervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) subh as a mouse, rat, rabbit, or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and binding capacity. In some instances, framework region residues of the human immunoglobulin are also replaced by coitresponding non-human residues (so called "back mutations"). The<br><br>
positions for such backmutations can be determined by sequence and structural analysis, or by analysis of the variable regions' three-dimensional [structure using a computer model. In addition, phage display libraries can be used to vary amino acids at chosen positions within the antibody sequence. The properties of a humanized antibody are also affected by the choice of the human framework. Furthermore, humanized and chimerized antibodies can pe modified to comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody t&gt;r in the donor antibody, in order to further improve antibody properties, such $s affinity. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise all or Substantially all of at least one, two or even all three COR domains that Correspond to the CDR domains of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the framework region residues are those of a human iitnmunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also cjomprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), topically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., feature 321:522-525 (1986); and Reichmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988). Thus, provided in one embodiment of the invention is a mAb that is humanized by grafting to introduce components of human immunoglobulins without substantially interfering with the ability of the antibody to bind antigen (/.ie., CD20).<br>
The mAbs or antigen-binding fragments of the invention can be naked arjtibodies or antigen-binding fragments that are not conjugated to other agjents, for example, therapeutic agent. Alternatively, the mAb or antigen-bir|ding fragment can bo conjugated to a therapeutic agent (i.o., to form an immunoconjugate) such as a cytotoxic agent, a small molecule compound, a holrnone, growth factor, cytokine, enzyme, RNase, ribozyme or a nucleic acid molecule including coding sequences, antisense RNA and RNAi.<br>
Illustrative cytotoxic agents include but are not limited to protein toxins suc-h as ricin, diphtheria toxin, Step/?y/ococca/enterotoxin, Pseudomonas excjtoxin, abrin or other ribosomal inactivating proteins. These proteins can be linked to the antibody or antibody fragment either chemically using a chemical cross-linking agent or by recombinant nucleic acid technology by constructing a fusion protein that encodes all or part of the protein toxin. Other illustrative cytotoxic agents include high-energy radioisotopes such as<br><br>
90Y, 131I or 111ln. Further cytotoxic agents include cytotoxic and cystostatic drugs such as methotrexate, chlorambucil, adriamycin, daunorubicin and vincristine.<br>
Alternatively, the mAb or antigen-binding fragment can be detectably labeled. Exemplary detectable labels include radiolabels, heavy metals, chromophores, flourophores and enzymes where the end-product of the enzymatic reaction is detectable. Detectably labeled antibodies and antigen-binding fragments can be used, for example, in diagnostic and laboratory methods.<br>
The anti-CD20 mAbs can be made by any standard method known in the art, such as, for example, by the hybridoma method (Koehler and Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975); and Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103, (Academic Press, 1986)), or by recombinant techniques, disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 and by Wood etal., Nature 314:446-9 (1985).<br>
Monoclonal antibodies are typically produced by clones of a single cell, such as hybridoma cells, that produce a homogenous population of antibody molecules that have the same antibody combining site. The hybridoma cell is formed by fusing an antibody-producing cell and a myeloma or other self-perpetuating cell line. The preparation of such antibodies was first described ,by Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975), which description is<br>
i<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Additional methods are described by Zola, Monoclonal Antibodies: a Manual of Techniques, CRC Press, Inc. (1987). The hybridoma supernates so prepared can be screened for the presence of antibody molecules that bind to CD20 and/or have other desirable characteristics as described herein.<br>
Generally to produce a hybridoma that produces an anti-CD20 mAb, a myeloma or other self-perpetuating cell line is fused with lymphocytes obtained from the spleen, lymph nodes or other antibody producing ceils, of a mammal hyperimmunized against CD20 (see, e.g., Kearney et al., J. Immunol., 123:1548-50 (1979)).<br>
In one embodiment, the myeloma cell line used to prepare a hybridoma is from the same species as the lymphocytes. A suitable mouse myeloma for use in the present invention is the NS-1 myeloma cell lines available from the<br><br>
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, United States of America.<br>
Splenocytes are typically fused with myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1500. Fused hybrids are selected by their sensitivity to HAT. Hybridomas producing a disclosed monoclonal antibody are identified using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescence-activated , cell sorting (FACS) described herein.<br><br>
The antibody producing cells can be obtained from an inbred mouse strain, such as the C57BL/6 strain. In other embodiments, the antibody producing cell is from a CD20'7' mammal, for example a CD20"'" mouse. In one representative embodiment, the CD20"7" mouse is originally derived from strain 129 mice. The CD20"A mammal can be produced using techniques known to one of skill in the art and as described herein, see, e.g., Hogan et al. (1986) Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.<br>
The anti-CD20 mAbs of the present invention may be fully human. Methods of preparing fully human antibodies are known in the art and include the use of transgenic animals and phage display techniques.<br>
It is now also possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region (JH) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g. Jakobovits et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc/. USA 90, 2551-255 (1993); Jakobovits era/., Nature 362, 255-258 (1993).<br>
Mendez era/. (Nature Genetics 15: 146-156 (1997)) have further improved the technology and have generated a line of transgenic mice designated as "Xenomouse II" that, when challenged with an antigen, generates high affinity fully human antibodies. This was achieved by germ-line integration of megabase human heavy chain and light chain loci into mice with deletions in the endogenous JH segment as described above. The<br><br>
Xenomouse II harbors 1,020 kb of human heavy chain locus containing approximately 66 VH genes, complete DH and JH regions and three different constant regions (ยต, 6 and %), and also harbors 800 kb of human K locus containing 32 VK genes, JK segments and CK genes. The antibodies produced in these mice closely resemble those seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and repertoire. The human antibodies are preferentially expressed over endogenous antibodies due to deletions in the endogenous JH segment that prevents gene rearrangement in the murine locus.<br>
Other methods of producing a mAb are also known. See, for example, the method of isolating mAbs from an immunological repertoire as described by Sastry, et al, Proc NatlAcad Sci USA 86:5728-5732 (1989); and Huse et al, Science 246:1275-1281 (1989).<br>
Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al., Nature 348, 552-553 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglbbulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B-cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3, 564-571 (1993).<br>
Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson etal,, Nature 352, 624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V-genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V-genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following<br><br>
the techniques described by Marks etal., J. Mol. Biol. 222, 581-597 (1991), or Griffith et a/., EMBO J. 12, 725-734 (1993). In a natural immune response, antibody genes accumulate mutations at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). Some of the changes introduced will confer higher affinity, and B cells displaying high-affinity surface immunoglobulin are preferentially replicated and differentiated during subsequent antigen challenge. This natural process can be mimicked by employing the technique known as "chain shuffling" (Marks et a/., Bio/Technol. 10, 779-783). In this method, the affinity of "primary" human antibodies obtained by phage display can be improved by    . sequentially replacing the heavy and light chain V-region genes with repertoires of naturally occurring variants (repertoires) of V-domain genes obtained from unimmunized donors. This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the nM range. A strategy for making very large phage antibody repertoires has been described by Waterhouse et a/., A/we/. Acids Res. 21, 2265-2266 (1993).<br>

The inventors have made the unexpected discovery that novel antibodies with distinct characteristics (e.g., CDR regions, density of binding, and the like) can be generated from a CD20'A mammal. Accordingly, in one representative embodiment, the invention provides a method of producing a   . monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to CD20, comprising: (a) immunizing a CD20"'" mammal (e.g., a mouse) with CD20 or an antigenically effective fragment thereof under conditions sufficient to elicit an antibody response; (b)harvesting antibody producing cells (e.g., B cells) from the mammal; (c) fusing the antibody producing cells with immortalized cells (e.g., myeloma cells) in culture to form monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma cells; (d) culturing the hybridoma cells under conditions sufficient for<br><br>
production of monoclonal antibodies; and (e) recovering monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to CD20 from the culture. The method can optionally include isolation of a hybridoma cell line that produces an anti-CD20 mAb.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of producing a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to CD20, comprising; (a) immunizing a CD20"'" mammal with CD20 or an antigenically effective fragment thereof under conditions sufficient to elicit an antibody response; (b) harvesting a cell that produces an antibody that specifically binds to CD20 from the mammal; (c) isolating an immunoglobulin coding gene from the antibody-producing cell; (d) introducing the immunoglobulin coding gene into a different cell to produce a transformed cell; (e) culturing the transformed . cell under conditions sufficient for transcription and translation of the immunoglobulin gene and production of a monoclonal antibody; and (e) recovering from the culture monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to CD20. In particular embodiments, both heavy chain and light chain genes are isolated from the antibody producing cell or from different antibody producing ceHs and are introduced into the transformed cell(s). The transformed cell can be any suitable cell, for example, a mammalian cell or cell line such as CHO or BHK cells.<br>
Also provided by the invention are hybridoma cells, hybridoma cell lines, and hybridoma cell cultures that produce the mAbs of the invention, as described above. Exemplary hybridoma cell lines of the invention include hybridoma HB20-1, HB20-2, HB20-3, HB20-4, HB20-5, HB20-6, HB20-25, MB20-1, MB20-2, MB20-3, MB20-6, MB20-7, MB20-8, MB20-10, MB20-11, MB20-13, MB20-14, MB20-16 and MB20-18.<br>
Hybridoma cell lines HB20-3, HB20-4, HB20-25, MB20-1, MB20-11 and MB20-18 were deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in Manassas, VA, USA in accordance with the Budapest Treaty on<br>
May 5, 2004, and assigned ATCC Accession Nos.	(HB20-3),	<br>
(HB20-4),	(HB20-25),	(MB20-1),	(MB20-11) and	<br>
(MB20-18), respectively.<br>
The invention also provides nucleic acids encoding the mAbs, antigen-binding fragments, antibody heavy chains and/or antibody light chains or<br><br>
portions thereof (e.g., variable regions, CDR regions) of the invention. The nucleic acid can be DNA, RNA or chimeras thereof, single stranded or double-stranded, and can be fully or partially synthetic or naturally occurring. The nucleic acids can comprise modified nucleotides or nucleotide analogs. Further, the nucleic acid can be from any species of origin, including mammalian species such as human, non-human primate, mouse, rat, rabbit, cattle, goat, sheep, horse, pig, dog, cat, etc.<br>
In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid is an isolated nucleic acid. As used herein, an "isolated" nucleic acid means a nucleic acid separated or substantially free from at least some of the other components of the naturally occurring organism, such as for example, the cell structural components or other polypeptides or nucleic acids commonly found associated with the nucleic acid.<br>
The invention also provides vectors, including expression vectors and gene delivery vectors, comprising the nucleic acids of the invention. Suitable vectors include bacterial expression vectors, fungal expression vectors, mammalian vectors, yeast expression vectors and plant expression vectors. Exemplary vectors include bacterial artificial chromosomes, cosmids, yeast    , artificial chromosomes, phage, plasmids, lipid vectors and viral vectors (e.g., adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, baculovirus, and the like).<br>
Expression vectors can be designed for expression of polypeptides in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, polypeptides can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, yeast cells, insect cells (e.g., in the baculovirus expression system) or mammalian cells. Some suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Examples of vectors for expression in yeast S. cerevisiae include pYepSecl (Baldari et al., (1987) EMBO J. 6:229-234), pMFa (Kurjan and Herskowitz, (1982) Cell 30:933-943), pJRY88 (Schultz et al., (1987) Gene 54:113-123), and pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.). Baculovirus vectors available for expression of nucleic acids to produce proteins in cultured insect cells (e.g., Sf 9 cells) include the pAc series (Smith et al., (1983) Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow, V.A., and Summers, M.d. (1989) Virology 170:31-39).<br><br>
Examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDMS (Seed, (1987) Nature 329:840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman et al. (1987), EMBOJ. 6:187-195).<br>
The vector generally comprises an expression control element (e.g., a promoter) operably associated with the nucleic acids of the invention. It will be appreciated that a variety of expression control elements can be used depending on the level and tissue-specific expression desired. Further, the promoter can be constitutive or inducible (e.g., the metalothionein promoter or a hormone inducible promoter). The expression control element can be native or foreign to the host cell and can be a natural or a synthetic sequence. The promoter is generally chosen so that it will function in the target cell(s) of interest.   The nucleic acids can further be associated with other appropriate expression control sequences, e.g., transcription/translation control signals and polyadenylation signals. Viral regulatory elements are often employed in mammalian cells. For example, commonly used promoters in mammalian expression vectors are derived from polyoma, adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40.<br>
Moreover, specific initiation signals are generally required for efficient translation of inserted protein coding sequences. These translational control sequences, which can include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences, can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic.<br>
Further provided are host cells (e.g., yeast, bacterial, mammalian, insect, plant or fungal cells) comprising the isolated nucleic acids and vectors of the invention. The cell can be transiently or stably transformed with the nucleic acid or vector of the invention. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid is stably incorporated into the genome of the host cell. Further, the cell can be cultured (i.e., isolated) or can be a cell in situ in a living organism.<br>
Methods of Use.<br>
The antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, nucleic acids and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be used in a number of research, diagnostic and/or therapeutic applications. To illustrate, the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention specifically bind to CD20, which is a B cell specific marker. Accordingly, these reagents find use<br><br>
in methods of identifying B cells, methods of studying CD20 function as well as methods for immunoaffinity purification of CD20 or B cells. Methods of isolating B cells can be used for laboratory research, therapeutic or diagnostic methods. For example, tissue or cells can be removed from a subject having a B cell malignancy, the B cells purified away with the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the invention, and the B cell depleted tissue or cells re-introduced into the subject. Further, the antibodies, antigen-binding fragments and compositions of the invention can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example, to identify lymphomas. The methods of the invention also provide for B cell specific delivery of molecules using antibodies or antigen-binding fragments conjugated with therapeutic agents (as described above). Further, the invention also provides therapeutic methods of depleting B cells, for example, for the treatment of B cell disorders such as B cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the invention provides a method of depleting B cells in an animal subject (e.g., a mammalian subject) comprising administering a mAb, antigen-binding fragment or pharmaceutical composition<br>
i<br>
of the invention to the mammalian subject in an amount effective to deplete B cells. By "amount effective to deplete B cells" it is meant an amount effective to achieve a reduction (i.e., depletion) in B cells of at least about 25%, 35%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more. In some embodiments, there will be no, or essentially no, detectable B cells. Methods of detecting B cells and measuring B cell depletion are known in the art (see, e.g., Examples 9-12,14 and 17). In representative embodiments, at least about 25%, 35%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more depletion is achieved in peripheral circulating and/or tissue (e.g., spleen, lymph node) B cells. Those skilled in the art will understand that for clinical applications, peripheral circulating B cells are measured/monitored, which is generally less invasive than methods of evaluating B cell depletion in tissues.<br>
The invention further provides methods of treating a B cell disorder comprising administering to an animal (e.g., mammalian) subject having a B cell disorder a treatment-effective amount of one or more monoclonal antibodies, antigen-binding fragments or pharmaceutical formulations of the<br><br>
invention. In particular embodiments, the B cell disorder is a B cell malignancy or an autoimmune disease.<br>
The term "B cell malignancy" and grammatical variants thereof, are used in the broadest sense to refer to malignancies or neoplasms of B cells that typically arise in lymphoid tissues, such as bone marrow or lymph nodes, but may also arise in non-lymphoid tissues, such as thyroid, gastrointestinal tract, salivary gland and conjunctiva. The treatment methods of the present invention specifically concern CD20-positive B cell malignancies including, without limitation, B-cell subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Burkitt's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia. B-cell subtype Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is a term that is used to encompass a large group (over 29 types) of lymphomas caused by malignant B cell lymphocytes, and represents a large subset of the known types of lymphoma including but not limited to low grade/follicular NHL, small lymphocytic (SL) NHL, intermediate grade/follicular NHL, intermediate grade diffuse NHL, high grade immunoblastic NHL, high grade lymphoblastic NHL, high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL and bulky disease NHL.<br>
Autoimmune disorders are caused in part by a breakdown in self-tolerance leading to subsequent immune responses against self, including the production of autoantibodies and deposition of immunoglobulin in affected tissues.   Autoantibodies form immune complexes that promote complement and Fc-receptor mediated tissue inflammation and destruction. Most autoimmune diseases result from, or are aggravated by, the production of antibodies reactive with normal body tissues. Since B lymphocytes are the source of autoantibodies, they afford a rational target for treatment of these types of immune-mediated diseases. B lymphocytes can also present antigen and regulate the development of effector T lymphocytes.<br>
More than 80 autoimmune diseases have been identified. Autoimmune diseases, their etiology and treatment are discussed extensively in the Autoimmune Diseases Research Plan published by the Autoimmune Diseases Coordinating Committee of the National Institutes of Health. Representative autoimmune diseases that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to immune complex disorders<br><br>
such as those that result in glomerulonephritis, Goodspature's syndrome, necrotizing vasculitis, lymphadenitis, peri-arteritis nodosa and systemic lupus erythematosis. Other illustrative autoimmune diseases include but are not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, scleroderma, perphigus vulgaris, ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis), urveitis, Sjogren's syndrome, Crohn's disease, Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Lyme arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and cardiomyopathy. Other diseases associated with antibody production that can be treated according to the present invention include, but are not limited to multiple sclerosis, atopic dermatitis, thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemias, immune reactions against foreign antigens such as fetal A-B-O blood groups during pregnancy, myasthenia gravis, Type I diabetes, Graves' disease, and allergic responses.<br>
The methods of the invention may be used to treat any other disorder or condition in which B cells or antibodies are implicated including, for example, transplant rejection.<br>
A "treatment effective" amount is an amount of an anti-CD20 antibody or antigen-binding fragment sufficient to produce some improvement or amelioration in tho subject's condition or to prevent or delay relapse or recurrence of the condition.<br>
Subjects can be monitored by standard techniques known in the art to follow clinical indicia of B-cell malignancy or the particular autoimmune disease. For example, in the case of B-cell malignancy, tumor regression (e.g. tumor size in the case of solid tumors), the phenotype of circulating B-cells or of biopsied tissues using anti-CD20 antibodies can be monitored.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dosages can be selected based on a number of factors including the age, sex, species and condition of the subject, the desired degree of depletion, the disease to be treated and/or the particular antibody or antigen-binding fragment being used and can be determined by one of skill in the art. For example, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients or patients with autoimmune disease may receive from about 0.0005<br><br>
to about 1500 mg/m2/week, specifically from about 0.001 to about 150 mg/m2/week, more specifically from about 0.25 to about 75 mg/m2/week, more specifically from about 2.5 to about 50 mg/m2/week of an anti-CD20 antibody as described herein.<br>
In embodiments of the invention, the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments bind to B cells at a greater density than conventional anti-CD20 antibodies and, thus, can result in a more efficient (i.e., at lower dosage) depletion of B cells (as defined above). Alternatively, or additionally, more efficient depletion may be a result of the particular epitope with which the antibody reacts. In exemplary embodiments, dosages of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment (optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as part of a pharmaceutical composition) are at least about 0.0005, 0.001, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 37.5, 50 or 100 mg/m2 and/or less than about 200, 175,150, 125, 100, 75, 60, 50, 37.5, 20, 15, 10, 5, 2.5,1, 0.5, 0.375, 0.1, 0.075 or 0.01 mg/m2. In other illustrative embodiments, the dosage is between about 0.0005 to about 200 mg/m2, between about 0.001 and 150 mg/m2, between about 0.075 and 125 mg/m2, between about 0.375 and 100 mg/m2, between about 2.5 and 75 mg/m2, between about 10 and 75 mg/m2, and between about 20 and 50 mg/m2.<br>
In some embodiments of the methods of this invention, mAbs, antigen-b,inding fragments and/or compositions of this invention can be administered at a dose lower than about 375 mg/m2; at a dose lower than about 37.5 mg/m2; at a dose lower than about 0.375 mg/m2; and/or at a dose between about 0.075 mg/m2 and about 125 mg/m2.<br>
The specified dosage can result in B cell depletion (as described above) for a period of at least about 3, 5, 7, 10, 14,20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120,150 or 180 days or longer.<br>
In representative embodiments of the invention, a dosage of about 125 mg/m2 or less of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment results in B cell depletion (as described above) for a period of at least about 7,14,21, 30, 45, 60 days, 90 or 120 days. In another representative embodiment, a dosage of about 37.5 mg/m2 or less depletes B cells for a period of at least about 7,14, 21, 30,45, 60, 90 or 120 days. In still other embodiments, a dosage of about 0.375 mg/m2 or less results in depletion of B cells for at least about 7,14, 21,<br><br>
30,45 or 60 days. In another embodiment, a dosage of about 0.075 mg/m2 or less results in depletion of B cells for a period of at least about 7,14, 21, 30, 45 or 60 days. In yet other embodiments, a dosage of about 0.01 mg/m2, 0.005 mg/m2 or even 0.001 mg/m2 or less results in depletion of B cells for at least about 3, 5, 7,10,14, 21 or 30 days. According to these embodiments, the dosage can be administered by any suitable route (as described below), but is optionally administered by a subcutaneous route.<br><br>
As another aspect, the invention provides the discovery that B cell depletion and/or treatment of B cell disorders can be achieved at lower dosages of antibody or antibody fragments than employed in currently available methods. Thus, in another embodiment, the invention provides a method of depleting B cells and/or treating a B cell disorder, comprising administering to an animal subject (e.g., a mammalian subject), an effective amount of a mAb or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to CD20, wherein a dosage of about 200, 175, 150, 125, 100, 75, 60, 50, 37.5, 20,10, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.375, 0.25, 0.1, 0.075, 0.05, 0.001, 0.0005 mg/m2 or less results in a depletion of B cells (circulating and/or tissue B cells) of 25%, 35%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more for a period at least about 3, 5, 7, 10, 14,21,30,45,60,75,90, 120, 150 or 180 days or longer. In representative embodiments, a dosage of about 125 mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2 or less results in at least about 50%, 75% 85% or 90% depletion of B cells for at least about 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 75, 90, 120,150 or 180 days. In<br><br>
other embodiments, a dosage of about 50, 37.5 or 10 mg/m2 results in at least about a 50%, 75% 85% or 90% depletion of B cells for at least about 7, 14, 21, 30,60, 75, 90,120 or 180 days. In still other embodiments, a dosage of about 0.375 or 0.1 mg/m2 results in at least about a 50%, 75%, 85% or 90% depletion of B cells for at least about 7,14, 21, 30.-60, 75 or 90 days. In further embodiments, a dosage of about 0.075, 0.01, 0.001, or 0.0005 mg/m2 results in at least about a 50%, 75%, 85% or 90% depletion of B cells for at least about 7, 14, 21, 30 or 60 days. According to these embodiments, the dosage can be administered by any suitable route (as described below), but is optionally administered by a subcutaneous route.<br>
According to this embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment as described herein<br><br>
(including functionally equivalent antibodies and antigen-binding fragments). In other particular embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment binds to C020 or B cells at a higher density as compared with conventional antibodies (as described above).<br>
The antibodies, antigen-binding fragments and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be used in combination with other therapeutic agents or regimes. For example, in the case of B-cell malignancies, such regimes or therapies include chemotherapy, radioimmunotherapy (RIT), chemotherapy and external beam radiation (combined modality therapy, CMT), or combined modality radioimmunotherapy (CMRIT) alone or in combination, etc. Thus, the anti-CD20 antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention can be combined with CHOP (Cyclophosphamide-Hydroxydoxorubicin-Oncovin (vincristine)-Prednisolone), the most common chemotherapy regimen for treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In addition, the anti-CD20 antibodies herein may be administered in combination with other antibodies, including anti-CD19, anti-CD22 (as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No.5,484,892, U.S. patent publication number 2004/0001828 of U.S. application serial number 10/371,797, U.S. patent publication number 2003/0202975 of U.S. application serial number 10/372,481 and U.S. provisional application serial number 60/420,472, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein for their teachings of CD22 antigens and antj-CD22 antibodies), and other anti-CD20 antibodies, such as Rituxanโข (C2B8; Rituximab; IDEC Pharmaceuticals).<br>
Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of depleting B cells in a mammalian subject, comprising administering a mAb and/or antigen-binding fragment thereof of this invention and further comprising administering one or more additional antibodies and/or antigen binding fragments thereof to the subject. In some embodiments, the additional antibody can be an anti-CD22, an antiOCD-19 antibody or both antibodies. The additional antibody or antibodies and/or antigen-binding fragment(s) thereof can be administered in any sequence relative to the administration of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment of this invention.<br><br>
l-or example, the additional antibody or antibodies and/or antigen-binding fragment(s) can be administered before, concurrently with, and/or after administration of the antibody and/or antigen-binding fragment of the invention to the subject. The additional antibody or antibodies and/or antigen fragment(s) can be present in the same pharmaceutical composition as the antibody and/or antigen-binding fragment of the invention, and/or present in a different pharmaceutical composition. The dose and mode of administration . of the antibody and/or antigen-binding fragment of this invention and the dose of the additional antibody or antibodies and/or antigen-binding fragment(s) can be the same or different, in accordance with any of the teachings of dosage amounts and modes of administration as provided in this application and as are well known in the art.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the subject is administered a compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function (e.g., at least about 25%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 9% or more) in addition to an antibody of the invention. Such compounds are known in the art and include, without limitation, cytokines such as interleukins (e.g., IL-12), and interferons (e.g., alpha or gamma interferon). The compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function or enhancement can be formulated in the same pharmaceutical composition as the antibody or antigen-binding fragment. When administered separately, the antibody/fragment and the compound can be administered concurrently (within a period of hours of each other), can be administered during the same course of therapy, or can be administered sequentially (i.e., the patient first receives a course of the antibody/fragment treatment and then a course of the compound that enhances macrophage/monocyte function or vice versa).<br>
This embodiment of the invention can be practiced with the antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention or with other antibodies known in the art and is particularly suitable for subjects that are resistant to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy (for example, therapy with existing antibodies such as C2B8), subjects that are currently being or have previously been treated with chemotherapy, subjects that have had a relapse in a B cell disorder, subjects that are immunocompromised, or subjects that otherwise have an impairment in macrophage or monocyte function. The inventors have<br><br>
discovered that antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) primarily mediated by monocytes plays a more important role than previously recognized in B cell depletion. The prevalence of patients that are resistant to anti-CD20 therapy or have a relapse in a B cell disorder may be attributable, at least in part, to an impairment in macrophage or monocyte function. Thus, the invention provides methods of enhancing ADCC and/or macrophage and/or monocyte function to be used in conjunction with the methods of administering anti-CD20 antibodies and antigen-binding fragments.<br>
Subjects according to the present invention can be a human subject, although the invention can also be practiced for veterinary purposes, to treat hon-human mammals and avians. Non-limiting examples of mammalian subjects on which the diagnostic and therapeutic methods of the invention can be practiced include mice, rats, guinea pigs, pigs, goats, sheep, non-human primates, horses, dogs, cats, cattle, rabbits and humans. Avians include chickens, turkeys, quail, geese and ducks.<br>
The antibody compositions of the invention can be administered using any mode of administration including, but not limited to, inhalation (e.g., via an aerosol), buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces), intrathecal, intraarticular, intraplural, intracerebral, intravenous, intra-arterial, intraperitoneal, oral, intralymphatic, intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous, transderrnal, intranasal, rectal or vaginal administration and can be delivered by peristaltic means or in the form of a depot, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend, as is well known in the art, on such factors as the species, age, gender and overall condition of the subject, the nature and severity of the condition being treated and/or on the nature of the particular composition (i.e., dosage, formulation) that is being administered.. In particular embodiments, the route of administration is via bolus or continuous infusion over a period of time, once or twice a week. In other particular embodiments, the route of administration is by subcutaneous injection, optionally once or twice weekly.<br>
Suitable regimes for administration are variable with the subject and condition being treated, but are typified by an initial administration followed by repeated doses at one or more intervals by a subsequent injection or other administration. The intervals can be as short as a few hours, or as long as<br><br>
one or more weeks between doses. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion can be employed to maintain effective concentrations in the blood.<br>
The antibodies disclosed herein can also be used for in vitro procedures. The antibodies selectively bind CD20, which is expressed on B lymphocytes, and during specific phases of B lymphocyte development. As such, the antibodies of the present invention can be used to specifically deplete B lymphocytes from a mixed sample of cells, e.g. whole blood. Either the enriched or depleted B lymphocyte fractions can then be used as needed experimentally without risk of interference or interaction by other cell types. Methods for utilizing the antibodies disclosed herein for isolating B lymphocytes from mixed cell populations in vitro are well known in the art. As non-limiting examples, FACS, panning and magnetic separation techniques can be used with the antibodies disclosed herein to separate B lymphocytes from mixed cell populations.<br>
The antibodies disclosed herein can also be used to differentiate developmental subpopulations of B lymphocytes from each other. CD20 is not expressed on pro-B lymphocytes. Some expression can be found in pre-B lymphocytes. Immature, TI and T2 transitional B lymphocytes express higher amounts of CD20. Mature B lymphocytes express lower levels of CD20. This information, in combination with the techniques discussed above, or others known to one of skill in the art, is useful for determining what stage of development a study population of B lymphocytes is undergoing.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions.<br>
Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antibodies or antibody fragments of the invention. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier together with one or more of the antibodies or antibody fragments described herein, dissolved or dispersed therein as an active ingredient.<br>
As used herein, the terms "pharmaceutically acceptable" in reference to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents, indicates that the materials are capable of administration to or upon an animal without the production of undesirable physiological effects or toxicity.<br><br>
Formulation of pharmaceutical compositions is well known in the art of pharmaceutical chemistry. See, e.g. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, (15th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1975), particularly Chapter 87, by Blaug, Seymour). Pharmaceutical compositions include without limitation powders, pastes, ointments, jelly, waxes, oils, lipids, anhydrous absorption bases, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of a variety of molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. A typical dosage form is a sterile, isotonic, water-based solution suitable for administration by parenteral (e.g., intravenous or subcutaneous) route. The concentration of the antibodies or antibody fragments of the invention in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, e.g., from less than about 0.01%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% or 2% to as much as 5%, 10%, 20% or 50% or more by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be administered via liposomes. Liposomes include emulsions, foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospholipid dispersions, lamellar layers and the like. In these preparations the composition of the invention to be delivered is incorporated as part of a liposome, alone or in conjunction with a molecule, which binds to a desired target, such as an antibody, or with other therapeutic or immunogenic compositions. Liposomes for use in the invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, e.g., liposome size, acid lability and stability of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka et al. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369.<br>
The preparation of a pharmaceutical composition that contains active ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art. Typically such compositions are prepared as liquid solutions or suspension; however, solid forms suitable for solution, or suspensions, in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified.<br><br>
The active ingredient can be mixed with excipients that are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the methods described herein. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide) that are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be<br><br>
derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine and the like.<br>
Exemplary liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose, polyethylene glycol and other solutes.<br>
Liquid compositions can also contain liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of water. Exemplary of such additional liquid phases are glycerin, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, and water-oil emulsions.<br>
Having described the present invention, the same will be explained in greater detail in the following examples, which are included herein for illustration purposes only, and which are not intended to be limiting to the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Generation ofCD20~'~ Mice. DNAs encoding the 3' end of the Cd20 gene were isolated from a 129/Sv strain mouse DNA phage library, mapped, and sequenced to identify intron/exon boundaries (Figure 1A and Figure 1B) (Tedder, et at. (1989) J. Immunol. 142:2560). Gene-targeting used a pBlue'script SK-based vector (p594) containing a Pstl (exbn 5) through EcoRV (exon 6, ~1.8 kb) DNA fragment downstream of the pMC1-HSVgene. An -10 kb Kpn\ DNA fragment was inserted downstream of the neomycin resistance (A/eo7) marker (Figure 1C). The plasmid was linearized using a unique Safi restriction site and transfected into 129 strain-derived ES cells that were selected for using G418 according to standard methods (Koller and Smithies (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 86:8932). Six of 115 Neo-resistant ES cell colonies carried the targeted allele (Figure 1D). Appropriate targeting was further verified by Southern analysis of DNA digested with BamHl (&gt;12 kb fragment reduced to a 6.5 kb band), Kpnl (7.2 kb became 5.5 kb), and Sspl (5.6 kb became 7.0 kb) using the same probe. Cells of one ES cell clone generated 80-100% chimeric male offspring that were crossed with C57BL/6 mice for 2:7 generations. Heterozygous offspring were crossed to generate<br>
homozygous CD20"/- and wild-type littermates (Figure 1E). In most cases, results obtained using wild-type littermates of CD20^ mice and (C57BL/6 x 129)pi mice were identical, therefore the results were pooled. Spleen and peritoneal cavity subset analysis was carried out using 3-10 littermates pairs<br>
at various ages so only comparisons between wild-type and CD20~/~ mice are valid. Mice were housed in a specific-pathogen-free barrier-facility and used at 2-3 months of age.<br>
Knockout Mice. FcyRI"7" and FcyRIH"'" mice are as described (Bruhns, et al. (2003) Immunity 18:573-581). C57BL/6, FcyRII*' (B6,129S-Fcgr2tm1Rav), FcyRlir/-(C57BL/6-Fcgr3tm1Sjv), Beige (C57BL/6-Lysbg/bg), Perform"' (C57BL/6-Pfptm1 Sdz), CSF1op (Csf1op), and nude (CS7BU6-Hfh11"") mice were from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). FcR common y chain (FcRy)-deficient mice (FcRy"7", B6.129P2-Fcerg1tm1) were from Taconic Farms (Germantown, New York). C1q"A mice as described (Botto, et al. (1998) Nat. Genet. 19:56-59) were provided by Garnett Kelsoe (Duke University) with the<br><br>
permission of Mark Walport (Imperial College, London, UK), LAT* mice were from Weiguo Zhang (Duke University) as described (Zhang, et al. (1999) Immunity 10:323-332), and C3'A and C4-/- mice were from Michael Carroll (Center for Blood Research, Boston, MA) as described (Wessels, et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:11490-11494). Macrophage-deficient mice were generated by tail vein injections of clodronate encapsulated liposomes (0.1 mL/10 gram body weight; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) on day -2, 1 and 4 using standard methods (Van Rooij'en and Sanders (1994) J. Immunol. Methods 174:83-93). All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility and first used at 2-3 months of age.<br>
Immunofluorescence Analysis. Single-cell leukocyte suspensions were stained on ice using predetermined optimal concentrations of each antibody for 20-60 minutes using well-established methods (Zhou, et al. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:3884). Cells with the forward and side light scatter properties of lymphocytes were analyzed on FACScan or FACScalibur flow cytometers (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Background staining was determined using unreactive control monoclonal antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with gates positioned to exclude ยฃ98% of the cells. Antibodies used included: CD19 monoclonal antibody (MB19-1) (Tedder, et al. (1988) Mol. Immunol. 25:1321; Tedder and Schlossman (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:10009; Valentine, et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:8085); B220 monoclonal antibody (RA3-6B2) (DNAX Corp., Palo Alto, CA); Thy1.2 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA); antibodies reactive with IgM, I-A, CD5, CD11b, CD23 and CD43 (BD PharMingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ); and anti-mouse IgGS, IgM and IgD antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL).<br>
Antibodies. HB20-1 through HB20-6 monoclonal antibodies were generated in BALB/c mice immunized with a mouse pre-B cell line that was transfected with cDNAs encoding human CD20 using standard methods (Steeber, et al. (1997) J. Immunol. 159:952-963). The HB20-25 mouse anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibody was generated in CD20"7" mice on a C57BI/6 x 129 genetic background that had been immunized with the mouse<br><br>
pre-B cell line 300.19 transfected with a cDNA encoding human CD20, using methods similar to those previously described (Steeber, et al. (1997) supra). All MB20 monoclonal antibodies were generated in CD20"A mice on a C57BI/6 x 129 genetic background as described above.<br>
Hybridomas producing CD20-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies were generated by the fusion of NS-1 myeloma cells with spleen cells from<br>
CD20-/- mice immunized with murine CD20-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transfected 300.19 cells (Kearney, et al. (1979) J. Immunol. 123:1548). The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies MB20-1, -2 and -14 were of the lgG1 isotype; MB20-6, -11, and -16 were lgG2a; MB20-7, -8, -10 and -18 were lgG2b; and MB20-3 and -13 were lgG3 monoclonal antibodies. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the 300.19 pre-B cell line expressing mouse CD20 fused with GFP were generated by transfecting each cell line with cDNA encoding the fused proteins (Tedder, et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 141:4388). Transfected cells were isolated by fluorescence-based cell sorting based on GFP expression.<br>
Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies 1F5 (Shan, et al. (1999) J. Immunol. 162:6589-6595), B9E9 (Schultz, etal. (2000) Cancer Res. 60:6663-6669),<br>
f<br>
and 1H4 (Haisma, et al. (1998) 8/000*92:184-190) were obtained through the Fifth International Workshop and Conference on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens (Boston, MA; November 3-7, 1993). The B1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Stashenko, et al. (1980) J. Immunol. 125:1678) from Beckman-Coulter (Miami, FL) was used as purified monoclonal antibody or as diluted ascites fluid.<br>
Intracellular Ca2* Measurements. Changes in [Ca2*]j levels were monitored by flow cytometry using standard methods (Shan, et al. (1998) B/ooc/91:1644) after treating the cells with goat F(ab')2 anti-IgM antibody (5-40 ug/mL; Cappel/ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, OH), anti-mouse CD19 monoclonal antibody (MB19-1; 40 ยตg/mL), thapsigargin (1 ยตM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), or ionomycin (2.67 ยตg/mL; CALBIOCHEMยฎ Biosciences, Inc., La Jolla, CA). In some cases, EGTA (5 mM final) was added to the cell suspension, followed by the agents described above.<br><br>
B Cell Activation Assays. Spleen B cells were purified (&gt;93% B220*) by removing T cells with Thy1.2 antibody-coated magnetic beads (DYNALยฎ Inc., Lpke Success, NY). For signal transduction studies, B cells were incubated (2 x 107/mL) in RPM11640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum at 37'C for 5 minutes before adding F(ab')2 anti-mouse IgM antibody fragments (40 ug/mL). After adding cold saline containing 400 ยตM EDTA and 100 uM Na orthovanadate, the cells were detergent-lysed using well-established methods (Bradbury, et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 149:2841; Fujimoto, et al. (1999) J. Immunol. 162:7088). For CD20 structural studies, B cells were surface-biotinylated with EZ-LINKโข Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (0.5 mg/mL; Pierce, Rockford, IL), then detergent-lysed. Cell lysates were precleared with lgG1 monoclonal antibody (1 ยตg) and 50 ยตL of a 50% suspension of Protein G-SEPHAROSEโข (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), with proteins immunoprecipitated using 2 ug of monoclonal antibody and Protein G-SEPHAROSEโข. The beads were washed twice with high- and low-salt RIPA buffers, twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), boiled in sample buffer (with or without 10% 2-mercaptoethanol), electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots of whole cell lysates were probed with MB20-1 monoclonal antibody, peroxidase-conjugated 4G10 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or with anti-phospho-CD19 (Y513), -PLCy (Y783), -Syk (Y525/Y526), -BTK (Y223), -Src family kinase antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), or anti-active MAPK antibody (PROMEGAยฎ, Madison, Wl). The membranes were stripped and reprobed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-SHP-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), or anti-Lyn (lyn-44), anti-Fyn (Fyn3) and anti-ERK2 (C-14) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Biotinylated proteins or antibodies were detected using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotechnology Assoc., Birmingham, AL) and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECLโข; Pierce, Rockland, IL).<br>
For studies of CD20 phosphorylation, primary B cells (107/mL) were cultured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (E. coli serotype 0111 :B4,10 Mg/mL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 48 hours. Primary B cells and cell lines were then cultured in phosphate-free media for 1 hour, cultured in medium containing<br><br>
200 ยตCi/mL [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) for 90 minutes, washed, lysed, immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE, with autoradiography conducted in accordance with standard methods (Kansas and Tedder (1991) J. Immunol. 147:4094; Leveille, et al. (1999) Eur. J. Immunol. 29:65).<br>
Functional Assays. Spleen B cell proliferation was measured by standard methods of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Engel, et al. (1995) Immunity 3:39). Eight-week old mice were immunized with 2,4-dinitrophenol-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (100 ยตg, DNP-KLH; CALBIOCHEMยฎ-Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA) or were immunized twice with (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl) conjugated to chicken gammaglobulin (50 ยตg, NP-tg-CGG)<br>
precipitated in alum according to well-known methods (Jacob, et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 173:1165). Serum DNP- and NP-specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA (Engel, et al. (1995) Immunity 3:39; Takahashi, et al. (1998) J. Exp. Med. 187:885), with the relative affinity/avidity of antibody responses assessed using standard methods (Takahashi, et al. (1998) J. Exp. Med. 187:885).<br>
Immunotherapy. Sterile anti-mouse CD20 and isotype control monoclonal antibodies (0.5-250 ยตg) in 200 ยตL PBS were injected through lateral tail veins. All experiments used 250 ยตg of monoclonal antibody unless indicated otherwise. Blood and spleens were collected 1 hour and 2,4, 7, 28, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56 or 58 days after treatment. Blood leukocyte numbers were quantified by hemocytometer following red cell lysis, with B2204 B cell frequencies determined by immunofluorescence staining with flow cytometry analysis. Antibody doses in humans and mice (Table 7) were compared using the Oncology Tool Dose Calculator (www.fda.gov/cder/cancer/animalframe.htm).<br>
C Assays. WT mouse spleen B cells were purified (&gt;93% B220*) by T cell removal using Thy-1.2 monoclonal antibody-coated magnetic beads (DYNALยฎ, Lake Success, NY). Quantification of C-mediated B cell killing in<br><br>
vitro was according to standard methods (Gazzano-Santoro, et al. (1997) J. Immunol. Methods 202:163-171). Spleen B cells were incubated with each anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (0.5 ยตg/mL) and baby rabbit C (diluted 50-fold; GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY) for 2 hours at 37ยฐC. PBS was added to each tube with incubation for 4 hours at 37ยฐC, before the cells were washed, stained with propidium iodide (PI) and anti-B220 monoclonal antibody, with propidium iodide exclusion determined by flow cytometry analysis.<br>
Heavy and Light Chain Gene Utilization. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from 1-10 x 105 hybridoma cells using the RNEASYยฎ Mini Kit (QIAGENยฎ, Chatsworth, CA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from cytoplasmic RNA using oligo-dT primers (dT18) and a SUPERSCRIPTโข Kit (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). One ยตL of cDNA solution was used as template for PCR amplification of VH genes. PCR reactions were carried out in a 100-uL volume of a reaction mixture composed of 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI2, 200 uM dNTP (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA), 50 pmol of each primer, and 5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (ISC Bioexpress, Kaysville, UT). Amplification was for 30 cycles (94ยฐC for 1 minute, 58ยฐC for 1 minute, 72ยฐC for 1 minute; Thermocycler, Perkin Elmer). VH genes were amplified using a promiscuous sense 5' VH primer (Ms\/HE; 5' GGG AAT TCG AGG TGC AGC TGC AGG AGT CTG G 3'; SEQ ID NO: 110) well-known in<br>

EXAMPLE 2 Generation of CD2Q'1' mice<br>
The targeting vector replaced exons encoding part of the second extracellular loop, the fourth transmembrane domain, and the large carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD20 with a neomycin resistance gene (Figure 1A-1D). Mice homozygous for Cd20 gene disruption were obtained at the expected Mendelian frequency by crossing heterozygous offspring of founder mice generated using targeted ES cells. Southern blot and PCR analysis of genomic DNA from homozygous offspring further verified<br>
appropriate Cd20 gene targeting and the genomic deletion of exons 6-8 (Figure 1E and Figure 1F). Wild-type CD20 mRNA was absent In CD2Q-/-mice as confirmed by PCR amplification of cDNA generated from splenocytes of CD20-/- mice (Figure 1G). A fused CD20-Neor gene transcript was<br>
detected at low levels in CD2Q-/- mice by PCR, which translated into an aberrant CD20 peptide truncated at amino acid 157 that was fused with an 88 amino acid peptide encoded by the Neor gene promoter sequence. Absence<br>
of cell-surface CD20 protein expression in CD20'/- mice was verified using a panel of twelve mouse anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibodies that were reactive with 300.19 and CHO cells transfected with CD20-GFP cDNA, but not with untransfected cells (Figure 1H). These monoclonal antibodies reacted with cell-surface CD20 epitopes expressed by CD19+ splenocytes<br>
from wild-type mice, but not from CD20"yL mice (Figure 11). Therefore, the targeted Cc/20 gene mutation abrogated cell-surface CD20 expression.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 B Cell Development in CD20'7' Mice<br>
CD20-/- mice thrived and reproduced as well as their wild-type littermates over nine years of observation and did not present any obvious anatomical or morphological abnormalities, or susceptibility to infections<br>
during the first year of life. CD20'/- mice had normal frequencies of IgM" B22010 pro/pre-B cells, IgM* B22010 immature B cells and IgM* B220hi mature B cells (Figure 1J, Table 4) and normal numbers of AA4.1* or heat stable antigen (HSA)1" B22010 immature/transitional B cells in their bone marrow. Numbers of blood, spleen and lymph node IgM* B220* B cells were not<br>
significantly different between CD20-/- mice and their wild-type littermates (Table 4).<br>

B cell IgM expression was significantly lower in CD20'/" mice relative to immature and mature B cells of wild-type littermates (Table 4, Figure U). In addition, there was an -50% reduction in numbers of lgMhi B22010 B cells in the spleens of CD20'/- littermates. Decreased numbers of lgMhi B22010 B cells may reflect reduced IgM expression by most B cells, but was not attributable to a loss in spleen marginal zone B cells since the number of cells with a<br>
CD1dhiCD21+ phenotype was not significantly different between CD20'/- and wild-type littermates (Table 4). Likewise, numbers of transitional T1 (CD21loHSAhl) and T2 (CD21hiHSAint) B cells, which represent recent<br>
emigrants from the bone marrow, were not reduced (Table 4). Rather, the frequency and number of T1 cells was usually higher in CD20"A mice, similar to the increase in frequency of mature lgM*B220hi B cells observed in bone marrow of CD20"'" mice. Decreased numbers of lgMhi B220'ยฐ B cells may be attributable in part to a reduction in spleen B1 cells since there was a 64% decrease in the number of CDS* B220'ยฐ B1a cells within the peritoneal cavity of CD20"' mice. The overall number of IgM* B220* B cells in the peritoneum of CD20-/- and wild-type littermates were similar due to an increase in the<br>
number of CDS' B220hi B cells (Table 4, Figure U). The number of B1b B cells (CD11b* CDS' B220'ยฐ) was similar in CD20'A and wild-type littermates (Table 4). There were no obvious differences in the size (light scatter<br>
properties) of CD20"/- B cells isolated from bone marrow, blood, lymph nodes or spleen when compared with B cells from wild-type littermates. An immunohistochemical analysis of spleen tissue sections revealed an otherwise normal architecture and organization of B220* B cells. Therefore, with the exception of decreased IgM expression, a reduction in the lgMhl B220'ยฐ B cell subset in the spleen, and low numbers of B1 cells within the peritoneal cavity, CD20 expression was not an obligate requirement for B cell development and tissue localization.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 CD20'โข B cell function<br>
The proliferative response of purified CD20'/- B cells to surface IgM ligation was comparable to wild-type B cells over a range of antibody concentrations (1-40 ยตg/mL; Figure 1K). Proliferation was also normal when the B cells were activated by LPS (Figure 1K) over a range of concentrations (0.1-10 ยตg/mL) or using IL-4 (10-100 U/mL) plus anti-IgM antibody at a<br>
i<br>
suboptimal (5 ug/mL) concentration. Thus, CD20 loss had no detectable effect on mitogen-induced proliferation. Normal levels of all Ig isotypes were found<br>
in sera from CD20-/- mice (Figure 1L). CD20'/- mice also generated primary and secondary antibody responses of all isotypes that were similar to those observed in wild-type littermates following immunization with a T cell-dependent antigen, DNP-KLH (Figure 1M). In addition, CD20~/- mice and<br>
their wild-type littermates generated equivalent primary and secondary IgM and lgG1 anti-NP antibody responses following immunization with NP-CGG (5 mice for each group). Moreover, the affinities of primary and secondary lgG1 anti-NP antibody responses generated in CD20'/- mice were similar to those generated in their wild-type littermates. Therefore, CD20 function was not required for T-B cell interactions, isotype switching or affinity maturation during the generation of humoral immune responses.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 CD20 Expression During B cell Development<br>
Using the panel of mouse anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibodies, two mouse pre-B cell lines (300.19 and 38B9) and two T cell lines (BW5147 Jand BL4) failed to express CD20 cell surface protein, while the 70Z pre-B line, A20 and AJ9 mature B cell lines and NS-1 plasmacytoma line were CD20+ (Figure 1H and Figure 2A). Similarly, CD20 was only expressed by subsets of B220"1" cells in the bone marrow (Figure 2B); 30ยฑ3% of B22010 lymphocytes were CD20+, while all B220hi B cells were CD20+ (n=6 mice). A similar fraction of CD19* B cells in the bone marrow were CD20* (51 ยฑ2%, n=6). Consistent with this, CD43* B220* pro-B cells did not express CD20, while 10ยฑ1% (n=3)<br>
of CD43- IgM' B220l0 pre-B cells expressed CD20 at low densities (Figure 2G). All CD20+ pre-B cells (CD43- IgM' B220'ยฐ) were small based on their light scatter properties, indicating that CD20 expression was primarily initiated at or near the time of heavy chain expression. Consistent with this, the majority of immature IgM* B220l0 B cells expressed CD20 (76ยฑ9%, n=3; fraction I, Figure 2G). A subpopulation of immature lgMhi B220+ (fraction II, Figure 2G) or CD1910 B cells in the bone marrow expressed CD20 at 277ยฑ53% (n=3) higher densities than mature B22Chi (fraction III, Figure 2G) or CD19hi B cells (Figure 2B). Thus, CD20 is first expressed during the small pre-B cell to immature B cell transition, with CD20 expression increasing with maturation and then decreasing with entry into the mature B220hi pool of recirculating B cells.<br>
In the spleen, blood, peripheral lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity, the   -vast majority of IgM* or B220* B cells expressed CD20 (Figure 2C-2F). A<br>
small subpopulation of CD20hi B22010 cells was observed among blood (9ยฑ1%, n=3) and spleen (7ยฑ2%, n=3) B cells<br>
 (Figure 2C and Figure 2E). The CD20hi B22010 B cells in the spleen were predominantly transitional T1 and T2 B cells (Figure 2H), and are likely to represent recent emigrants from the bone marrow. T1 cells (CD2110 HSAhi) expressed CD20 at 139ยฑ23% (n=3) higher densities than mature B cells, while T2 cells (CD21hi HSAhi) expressed CD20 at 58ยฑ11% (n-3) higher densities. T1 cells (CD2r CD23' lgMhl) and marginal zone B cells (CD21* CD23" lgMhi) (Loder, et al. (1999) J. Exp. Med. 190:75) also expressed CD20 at levels higher than the majority of spleen B<br>
cells (Figure 21). Small numbers of CD2Q- peripheral B cells were observed in some mice, but this number was typically 
peritoneal cavity, CD20 was expressed similarly by both CDS* and CDS" B cells (Figure 2F). CD20 was not expressed at detectable levels by other subpopulations of leukocytes in any of the tissues examined. Thus, mouse CD20 was expressed exclusively by B cells with expression initiated late during small pre-B cell maturation.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 Structural Characteristics of CP20<br>
Mouse and human CD20 were compared by precipitating these molecules from surface-labeled B cell lines using the MB20-1 monoclonal antibody reactive with mouse CD20 and the PB4 monoclonal antibody reactive with a cytoplasmic epitope of human CD20. Mouse CD20 migrated faster than human CD20 under non-reducing conditions, but also migrated as at least two distinct molecular species with Mr of 33,000 and 35,000 (Figure 3A). Under reducing conditions, mouse CD20 migrated as at least two equally represented molecular species with Mr of 40,000 and 42,000 (Figure 3A). Multiple cell-surface molecules coprecipitated with mouse CD20, as occurs with human CD20 (Tedder, et al. (1988) Molec. Immunoi. 25:1321; Deans, et al. (1993) J. Immunoi. 151:4494). The PB4 monoclonal antibody coprecipitates molecules associated with human CD20 better than monoclonal antibodies that react with CD20 extracellular domains. Coprecipitation of CD20-associated molecules in mouse was not due to<br>
monoclonal antibody cross-reactivity since the MB20-1 monoclonal antibody only reacted with mouse CD20 in western blot analysis and CD20 or other<br>
proteins were not precipitated from lysates of CD20~/" B cells (Figure 3B). Unexpectedly, mouse CD20 was not a dominant phosphoprotein in resting primary mouse B cells, in anti-IgM antibody- or LPS-activated B cells, or B cell lines, even after phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA) treatment (Figure 3C), as it is in human B cells (Tedder and Schlossman (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:10009; Genot, et al. (1993) J. Immunol. 151:71). Furthermore, PMA-induced phosphorylation of CD20 in LPS-blasts or B cell lines did not lead to a significant shift in CD20 protein Mr from the faster species to the slower species as characterizes human CD20 (Tedder and Schlossman (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263:10009; Valentine, etal. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84:8085). Thus, mouse and human CD20 share many structural features, with several distinct characteristics.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 Reduced rCa2*1i Responses in CD20/- B Cells<br>
Despite normal B cell development in CD20'/" mice, splenic B220* B cells from CD20'/- mice generated reduced [Ca2+]j responses following IgM ligation with optimal (40 ug/mL; Figure 4A) and suboptimal concentrations (5 ug/mL) of anti-IgM antibodies when compared with wild-type B cells. The kinetics of the immediate [Ca2+]j response was not altered in CD20'/" B cells. However, the magnitude of the maximal [Ca2"1]! increase was 34ยฑ4% lower<br>
(p
observed following IgM crosslinking on CD20'/- and wild-type B cells. The maximal magnitude of the [Ca2*Jj response in the presence of EGTA was<br>
38ยฑ7% lower (p
CD19-induced [Ca2*]j responses were significantly lower (70ยฑ4%, p
cells. Reduced [Ca2+]j responses following IgM- or CD19-ligation by CD20-/- B cells were not likely to result from differences in internal Ca2+ stores or extracellular Ca2+ concentrations since thapsigargin- and ionomycin-induced [Ca2+]j responses were slightly higher on average in CD20-/- B cells than in<br>
wild-type B cells (Figure 4C). The decrease in [Ca2"]j responses in CD2Q-/- B cells were also unlikely to result from differences in genetic backgrounds. CD20"'~ mice and their wild-type littermates were generated from 129 strain ES cells, but were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for at least seven generations. In control experiments, IgM-induced and CD19-induced [Ca2*]responses were similar, if not identical for C57BL/6, (C57BL/6 x 129)n and 129 B cells (n=4). Therefore, reduced [Ca2*]j responses in CD20'/' mice were likely to result from the absence of CD20 function, rather than background differences. Since [Ca2+]\ responses observed following CD19 cross-linking were primarily dependent on transmembrane Ca2+ flux and CD19-induced [Ca2*]j responses were significantly perturbed in CD20"/" mice, CD20 function may be particularly important for transmembrane Ca2* transport.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Signal Transduction in CDZO"1" B Cells<br>
The effect of CD20 loss on B cell transmembrane signal transduction was evaluated by assessing total cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation in purified B cells following IgM ligation. Overall levels of tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation were similar in resting splenic B cells from CD20'/" and wild-type littermates, although some variation was observed between B cells from individual mice in individual experiments (Figure 5A). Protein tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation after IgM ligation was also similar in B cells from CD20"/" and wild-type littermates. Phosphorylation of individual signaling molecules downstream of IgM, including Lyn and other Src kinases, PLCv, CD19, BTK,<br>
and MAP kinase, was also similar in B cells from CD2Q"'- and wild-typelittermates (Figure SB). Thus, CD20-deficiency was unlikely to significantly alter basal or kjM induced Irnnsmemhrane signaling.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Anti-CP20 Monoclonal Antibody Depletion of B cells in vivo<br>
Twelve mouse anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibodies, with representatives of each IgG isotype, were assessed for their ability to bind B cells and deplete them in vivo. Each monoclonal antibody reacted uniformly with CD19* primary B cells in vitro with characteristic mean fluorescence intensities that were independent of monoclonal antibody isotype (Figure 6A). When monoclonal antibody reactivity with primary B cells was assessed over a range of monoclonal antibody concentrations, most monoclonal antibodies reached saturating levels of staining when used at concentrations between 1-10 pg/mL (Figure 6B). On average, 50%-maximal log monoclonal antibody staining was achieved at monoclonal antibody concentrations of-0.5 ug/mL (arrows, Figure 6B). When all monoclonal antibodies were used at 0.5 ug/mL, each monoclonal antibody reacted uniformly with CD19"1" primary B cells with characteristic low to high mean fluorescence intensities (Figure 6C, Table 5). Similar results were obtained using a mouse CD20 cDNA-transfected pre-B cell line with anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody. Based on this analysis, the MB20-1 monoclonal antibody represented monoclonal antibodies with the 'lowest relative affinity/avidity, while the MB20-18 monoclonal antibody reacted strongly with B cells and stained B cells at the highest levels of all 12 anti-CU20 monoclonal antibodies (Table 5). Thus, each monoclonal antibody reacted specifically with B cells and displayed reasonable binding characteristics as assessed by flow cytometry.<br>

b Values (ยฑSEM) indicate the % of B220+ B cells depleted from blood or spleen 7 days after monoclonal antibody treatment (ns3) compared with isotype-matched control monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Each anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibody was given to mice at 250 ug/inouse, a single dose equivalent to a dose -10-fold lower (Table 7) than the 375 mg/m2 dose primarily given four times for anti-CD20 therapy in humans (Press, et al. (2001) Hematology:22'\-240; Kaminski, et al. (1993) N. Engl. J. Med. 329:459-465; Weiner(1999) Semin. Oncol. 26:43-51; Onrust, et al. (1999) Drugs 58:79-88; Mclaughlin, et al. (1998) Oncology 12:1763-1769). Under these conditions, multiple monoclonal antibodies had potent and long-lasting effects on peripheral B cell numbers, while other monoclonal antibodies had heterogeneous in vivo effects (Figure 7). The effectiveness of monoclonal antibody-induced B cell depletion from the circulation by day 2 and spleen by day 7 correlated closely with monoclonal antibody isotype (Table 5, Figure 7A and Figure 7B), with lgG2a&gt;lgG1&gt;lgG2b&gt;lgG3. MB20-11 and other lgG2a monoclonal antibodies (MB20-6 and -16) depleted &gt;95% of blood B cells and ~93% of splenic B cells. The few remaining peripheral B cells primarily represented phenotypically immature cells emerging from the bone marrow. The MB20-11 monoclonal antibody depleted significant<br>
numbers of circulating B cells when given as a single dose as low as 0.5 ยตg/mouse, while significant depletion of spleen B cells by d 7 required a 5-fold higher mAb dose of 2.5 ยตg/mouse (Figure 7C). Equally striking was the finding that a single injection of MB20-11 monoclonal antibody depleted circulating B cells within 1 hour of monoclonal antibody treatment, with a durable effect for ~57 days before B cells began to repopulate the circulation and spleen (Figure 7D). By contrast, none of the monoclonal antibodies had significant effects when given to CD20"'" mice and isotype-control monoclonal antibodies given under identical conditions did not affect B cell numbers (Figure 7). Likewise, circulating and tissue Thy1.2* T cell numbers were unchanged in anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-treated mice (Figure 7A), consistent with B cell-restricted CD20 expression.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 Role for FcvR in B Cell Depletion<br>
The role of the innate immune system in B cell depletion by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment was assessed using FcyR-deficient mice (Takai, et al. (1994) Cell 76:519-529). Mouse effector cells express three different FcyR classes for IgG, the high-affinity FcyRI (CD64), and the low-affinity FcyRII (CD32) and FcyRIII (CD16) molecules (Ravetch and Clynes (1998) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 16:421-432). FcyRI and FcyRIII are hetero-oligomeric complexes in which the respective ligand-binding y chains associate with a common y chain (FcRy). FcRy chain expression is required for FcyR assembly find for FcyR triggering of effector functions, including phagocytosis by macrophages and cytotoxicity by NK cells (Takai, et al. (1994) Cell 76:519-529). High-affinity FcyRI preferentially binds monomeric lgG2a &gt; lgG2b &gt; lgG3/lgG1, while the two low-affinity receptors bind polymeric IgGs of different isotypes (Fossati-Jimack, et al. (2000) J. Exp. Med. 191:1293-1302). FcyRIII binds lgG2a&gt;lgG1&gt;lgG2bยป lgG3 (Fossati-Jimack, et al. (2000) J. Exp. Med 191:1293-1302).<br>
In contrast to almost complete B cell depletion in wild-type mice (Figure 7), MB20-11 monoclonal antibody treatment reduced circulating B cell numbers by only 20-35% in FcRy"A mice over 4 days (Figure 8A), with no effect from day 7 to 18. Moreover, MB20-11 monoclonal antibody treatment<br>
actually increased spleen B cell numbers in FcRy"'" mice compared with control monoclonal antibody-treated littermates (Figure 8B and Figure 8C), predominantly due to increased numbers of immature B cells. An isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody had no significant effect in FoRy"'" mice. In FcyRI"7" mice, the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody induced an initial decrease in B cell numbers at 1 hour, but incomplete depletion of circulating B cells on . day 2. MB20-11 monoclonal antibody treatment only partially depleted B cells in FcyR!"7" mice with 21% of spleen B cells persisting at day 7 compared to control monoclonal antibody-treated littermates. ,By contrast, the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody depleted circulating and tissue B cells by ยฃ95% in wild-type, FcyRir'" and FcyRIH"'" mice by day 7. Identical results to those observed herein were obtained using two independent FcyRIH"/' mouse lines (Bruhns, et al. (2003) Immunity 18:573-581; Hazenbos, et al. (1996) Immunity 5:181-188). B cell depletion by the lgG1 MB20-1 and lgG2b MB20-18 monoclonal antibodies was similarly affected by FcRy chain-deficiency. Circulating B cells were not significantly reduced by MB20-1 monoclonal antibody treatment of FcRy"'" mice, while circulating B cells were depleted in wild-type mice (Figure 8D). Likewise, spleen B cells were not significantly reduced by MB20-1 monoclonal antibody treatment of FcRy"'" mice, while spleen B cell numbers were reduced by 93% in wild-type mice. Circulating B cells were significantly reduced by MB20-18 monoclonal antibody treatment of FcRy"'" mice, but not to the same extent as occurred in wild-type mice (Figure 8E). However, spleen B cells were not significantly reduced by MB20-18 monoclonal '. antibody treatment of FcRy"/~ mice, while spleen B cell numbers were reduced by 74% in wild-type mice. Thus, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy primarily depleted B cells through pathways that require FcRy chain expression.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 The Role of C in B cell Depletion<br>
Since C activation is considered a major mechanism for B cell depletion during anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy, the role of C in B cell depletion by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment was assessed using C-deficient (Wessels, et al. (1995) Proc. A/a//. Acad. Sci. USA 92:11490-<br>
11494) and C1q-deficient (Zhang, et al. (1999) Immunity 10:323-332) mice. The C-activating ability of each anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody was first assessed in vitro. In the presence of C, most of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies induced significant B cell lysis as indicated by propidium iodide uptake relative to isotype-matched control monoclonal antibodies, although cytotoxic capability varied between antibodies (Figure 9A). Without C, none of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies induced B cell Pi-uptake or apoptosis during these in vitro assays. The MB20-18 monoclonal antibody initiated the most potent C-dependent lysis of B cells, although the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody was also effective in inducing significant C-mediated B cell lysis in vitro. However, the ability of each monoclonal antibody to induce C-dependent B cell killing in vitro did not correlate with the ability of each monoclonal antibody to deplete B cells in vivo (Figure 7B). Moreover, the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody effectively cleared all blood and &gt;90% of spleen B cells in C3" and C4"'" mice (Figure 9B). This observation was not monoclonal antibody isotype-specific since the MB20-1 and MB20-18 monoclonal antibodies effectively depleted blood and spleen B cells to similar extents in both C3";' and wild-type mice (Figure 9C and Figure 9D) Thus, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy primarily depletes B cells through FcyR-dependent and C3-, C4- and C1q-independent mechanisms.<br>
EXAMPLE 12 Monocytes Mediate B Cell Depletion in vivo<br>
Since the depleting ability of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment correlated directly with monoclonal antibody isotype and FcyR expression, the contributions of NK cells, T cells, and macrophages to FcyR-mediated B cell depletion was determined. Mice rendered macrophage-deficient by treatment with liposorne-encapsulated clodronate did not significantly deplete circulating B cells by 1 hour after MB20-11 monoclonal antibody treatment, and had normal numbers of circulating B cells for up to 7 days (Figure 10A). Similarly, spleen B cell numbers in clodronate-treated mice were only decreased by 39% on day 7 relative to control monoclonal antibody-treated littermates (Figure 10B). Mice with tissue-specific losses in macrophage subpopulations (Cecchini, et al. (1994) Development 120:1357-1372) due to CSF-1 deficiency<br>
(CSF-1op) were also slow to clear circulating B cells after MB20-11 monoclonal antibody treatment and only depleted 84% of phenotypically mature spleen B cells by day 7 (Figure 10). By contrast, athymic nude and LAT'" mice that lack functional T cells (Zhang, et al. (1999) Immunity 10:323-332) depleted &gt;96% of blood and spleen B cells. Likewise, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment removed ~95% of circulating and spleen B cells in beige and perforin"'" mice (Figure 10) with defective NK cell function (Kagi, et al. (1994) Nature 369:31-37). These findings indicate that both CSF-1-dependent and -independent macrophage subsets are the major effector cells for depletion of CD20* B cells in vivo, and essentially exclude T cell-, NK cell-, and perforin-dependent mechanisms.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 Monoclonal Antibody Sequence Analysis<br>
CD20 is unique among most B lymphocyte cell surface molecules in that only a relatively small portion of the molecule is expressed on the cell surface, estimated to be approximately 42 amino acids. Thus, most anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies predominantly block the binding of other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies due to spatial constraints. While this has left the impression that most anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies bind to similar, if not identical regions or epitopes on the CD20 protein, this has not been shown. Moreover, interactions between protein antigens and the monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific epitopes on these antigens are complex and are almost unique to each monoclonal antibody and its specific amino acid sequence. This level of complexity in antigen and antibody interactions contributes to the generation of a diverse antibody repertoire to most foreign antigens. However, a limit on anti-CD20 antibody diversity is imposed by the fact that mice also express CD20 as a self antigen. Thus, under normal circumstances, mice will not generate antibodies reactive with antigenic determinants present on human CD20 that are also shared by mouse CD20, since these monoclonal antibodies would be autoreactive. It is therefore possible that anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies generated in a normal mouse bind to a limited number of defined epitopes that are present on, and unique to, human CD20.<br>
In contrast to the diverse repertoire of antibodies that can be generated against most protein antigens, inbred strains of mice often respond to haptens or structurally simple antigens by producing remarkably homogenous antibodies (Blierand Bothwell (1988) Immunol. Rev. 105:27-43). One of the<br>
best examples of restricted humoral responses is that of C57BL/6 (Igh^) mice to the (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP) hapten (Imanishi and Ma"kela" (1975) J. Exp. Med. 141:840-854). C57BL/6 mice immunized with NP coupled to protein carriers generate serum antibodies that bear the uncommon A1 light chain, while immunization with carrier protein alone elicits virtually no A1<br>
antibody or A1+ B cells (Imanishi and Makela (1975) supra; Ma'kela" and Karjalainen (1977) Immunol. Rev. 34:119-138; Reth, etal. (1978) Eur. J. Immunol. 8:393-400, Reth, et al. (1979) Eur. J. Immunol. 9:1004-1013; Karjalainen, et al. (1980) J. Immunol. 125:313-317; Weiss and Rajewsky (1990) J. Exp. Med. 172:1681-1689; Jacob, et al. (1991) J. Exp. Med. 173:1165-1175; Cumano and Rajewsky (1986) EMBO J. 5:2459-2466). Early in the anti-NP response (days 4-8 post-immunization) a large proportion of<br>
antigen-activated A1+ B cells express various D gene segments in combination with select members of the large J558 (V1) family of VH genes, including V186.2 (V1S2), C1H4, CH10, V23 (V1S4), 24.8, V102 (V1S7), and V583.5 (Jacob and Kelsoe (1992) J. Exp. Med. 176:679-687; Bothwell, et al. (1981) Cell 24:625-637; Allen, et al. (1988) EMBO J. 7:1995-2001; Jacob, et al. (1993) J. Exp. Med. 178:1293-1307). By day 10 after immunization, the<br>
majority of A1+ B cells express V1S2-to-DFL16.1 gene rearrangements that encode a tyrosine-rich CDR3 region with a YYGS (SEQ ID NO: 115) consensus amino acid motif (Weiss and Rajewsky (1990) supra; Bothwell, et al (1981) supra; Jacob, et al. (1993) supra; Cumano and Rajewsky (1985) Eur. J. Immunol. 15:512-520; McHeyzer-Williams, et al. (1993) J. Exp. M&amp;d. 178:295-305). The V1S.2-to-DFL16.1 heavy chain rearrangement paired with the A1 light chain is referred to as the canonical anti-NP B cell antigen receptor (Reth, et al. (1978) supra; Reth, et al. (1979) supra), which dominates the primary and secondary humoral immune responses of C57BL/6 mice to NP. Thus, the use of these specific antibody gene segments is considered to predict the antigen specificity of the monoclonal antibody.<br>
The homogeneity of the anti-NP antibody response in Ighb mice (Imanishi and Ma"kela (1975) supra) is mirrored in the response of BALB/c mice to phosphorylcholine (Crews, et al. (1981) Cell 25:59-66); antibodies produced against p-azophenylarsonate in strain A mice (Pawlak, et al. (1973) J. Exp. Med. 137:22-31); the 2-phenyloxazolone response in BALB/c and DBA/2 mice (Makela, et al. (1978) J. Exp. Med. 148:1644-1656); and the<br>
response of BALB/c mice to poly(Glu60-Ala30-Tyr'0) (Theze and Somme (1979) Eur J. Immunol. 9:294-301). The cause of low genetic variance in these antibody responses remains obscure. Linkage of restricted antibody responses to single V gene segments (Siekevitz, et al. (1983) Eur. J. (mmunol. 13:123-132) or Igh alleles (Siekevitz, et al. (1982) Eur. J. Immunol. 12:1023-1032) suggests an occasional, single-best solution to antigen-complementarity that results in expansion of a few B cell clones that bear homologous V(D)J rearrangements. In this case, strain-specific differences in the repertoire of germline VH genes would regulate the antibody response to<br>
structurally similar molecules. Alternatively, restricted antibody responses may be circumscribed by self-tolerance (Manser, et al. (1987) Immunol. Rev. 96:141-162; Hande, et al. (1998) Immunity 8:189-198) or depend on lymphocyte clones that express V(D)J rearrangements that are robustly tolerant of mutational change (Manser, et al. (1984) Science 226:1283-1288). Regardless of the mechanism, antibody responses to defined structures can be homogenous and reflect a limited response within the antibody repertoire, which may also reflect the fact that antibodies are binding the same target antigen  through  similar, it not identical molucular inloryctions that arc mediated by specific conserved amino acids within the variable regions of antibodies. While monoclonal antibody interactions with target antigens are primarily mediated by amino acids within complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of antibody molecules, framework amino acids are also critical to antigen-binding activity. Thus, structurally similar antibodies are likely to bind to the same antigens or region of a target molecule, while structurally dissimilar antibodies with different V regions are likely to interact with different regions of antigens through different molecular interactions.<br>
.   Since structurally similar antibodies that bind to the same region of a target antigen are more likely to bind the same molecular site on the target antigen, the amino acid sequences of published anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibodies was examined. The heavy and light chain V regions of the 1F5 (Shan, et al. (1999) supra), B9E9 (Schultz, et al. (2000) supra), 2H7 (U.S. Patent No. 6,120,767), 2B8 (U.S. Patent No. 5,843,439), 1H4 (Haisma, et al. (1998) supra), and Leu-16 (Wu, et al. (2001) supra) monoclonal antibodies are homologous in amino acid sequence (Figure 11). This level of conservation reflects the fact that each of these monoclonal antibodies is also similar at the nucleotide level. The heavy chains of these anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are generated through similar combinations of V(D)J gene segments with the V regions derived from the V1S121*01 gene segment, D regions derived from L16, Q52 or SP2 gene segments, and J regions derived from either J1 or J2 gene segments (Table 1). Similarly, the light chains were generated from either V4-72*01 gene segments, with J regions from either the J1*02 or J5*01 gene segments. The level of homogeneity among known anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibodies suggests that each of these monoclonal antibodies is binding to similar, or identical sites on human CD20.<br>
The level of amino acid sequence homology among known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies is highlighted by comparisons with a larger panel of anti-human CD20 and anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibodies. For comparisons, the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies were first contrasted with a second group of anti-human CL)20 monoclonal antibodies (HB20-03, -04 and -25) with homogeneous nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Comparative similarities between heavy chain and light chain V regions was visualized using UPGMA trees (unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages) as shown in Figure 12. In these diagrams, horizontal distances between tree branch points is a measure of sequence relatedness. For example, the heavy and light chains of the known mouse anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibodies were more similar to each other than the sequences of the HB20-03, -04 and -25 monoclonal antibodies, which were most similar to each other. Among light chain V region sequences, the 1H4 and B9E9 sequences were most similar, but were also quite similar to the<br>
sequences for the 2H7, 1F5 and 2B8 monoclonal antibody sequences. Similarly, the HB20-3 and HB20-4 monoclonal antibodies had quite similar amino acid sequences, which were relatively less similar with the corresponding sequence of the HB20-25 monoclonal antibody. However, the light chain sequences of the HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies were even more distinct from the sequences of the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. When sequence homologies of paired heavy and light chains between each monoclonal antibody were compared, the level of sequence homology between the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and the HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies were quite distinct (Figure 12). This indicates that these two groups of monoclonal antibodies are distinct and likely to bind to human CD20 through different molecular interactions or at distinct sites on the CD20 protein. It is also contemplated that the HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies would have shared biological properties that are distinct from the shared properties of the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.<br>
The level of amino acid sequence homology among known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies was further shown by comparisons with a larger panel of anli-humun CU20 and anti-mouse CU2U monoclonal antibodies. Generally, the 2B8, B9E9, 1F5, 1H4, and Leu-16 heavy chains were similar in sequence with heavy chains of the HB20-01, -02 and -06 monoclonal antibodies (Figure 13 and Figure 15). Based on sequence similarities, these heavy chain VยฐJ segments have been designated as group A sequences (Figure 13). The amino acid sequence of the 2H7 monoclonal antibody was similar, but divergent from the other group A heavy chains so this heavy chain was designated to represent group B heavy chains. HB20-03, -04 and -25 were structurally similar and were designated as group C heavy chains. The HB20-05 monoclonal antibody heavy chain was also structurally distinct and was designated to represent group D heavy chains. Many of the anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibodies shared structurally similar heavy chains, MB20-08, -10, -18, -07, -02 and -14, and were designated as group E heavy chains. The MB20-11 and -16 monoclonal antibody heavy chains were sufficiently distinct to represent group F. The MB20-01 and -13 monoclonal antibodies used very diverse heavy chains that were structurally distinct from all other anti-CD20<br>
monoclonal antibodies and were designated as group G heavy chains. These different groups of heavy chain amino acid sequences correlated closely with utilization of different V(D)J gene segments for generation of each of the anti-CD20 heavy chains (Table 1). Thus, the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody heavy chains were structurally distinct from the majority of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody heavy chains disclosed herein.<br>
The striking level of amino acid sequence homology among known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies was further highlighted by comparisons of light chain utilization among a panel of anti-human CD20 and anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibodies. The 2B8, B9E9, 1F5, 1H4, Leu-16 and 2H7 light chains were quite similar in sequence, but were distinct from the light chains used by other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Figure 16 and Figure 18). Based on sequence similarities, these light chains were designated as group A sequences (Figure 16). The amino acid sequence of multiple anti-mouse CD20 monoclonal antibody light chains was most similar, but divergent from the group A light chains, so these light chains were designated as group B. HB20-03, -04 and -25 were structurally distinct and were designated as group C light chains. The HB20-01, -02 and -06 monoclonal antibodies used similar light chains that were designated as group E. MB20-18 and MB20-01 used structurally distinct light chains and were therefore designated as groups F and G, respectively. These different groups of light chain amino acid sequences correlated closely with utilization of different VJ gene segments for generation of each of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Table 1). Thus, the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody light chains were structurally distinct from those used by the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein.<br>
An analysis of amino acid sequences of paired heavy and light chains further verified that different anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies fell into structurally distinct groups and would therefore bind human or mouse CD20 through different molecular interactions. The 2B8, B9E9,1F5, 1H4 and Leu-16 monoclonal antibodies used structurally similar heavy and light chains, designated as AA, respectively (Figure 19, Table 1). Since the 2H7 monoclonal antibody heavy chain was structurally different from the heavy chain used by other known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies but was paired<br><br>
with a similar light chain, this monoclonal antibody was grouped as a BA monoclonal antibody. The group CC monoclonal antibodies, HB20-03, -04 and -25, represent a unique class of structurally distinct anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Similarly, the utilization of unique heavy and light chains and the combinatorial diversity achieved by using different pairs of heavy and light chains allowed each of the other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies to be categorized as structurally distinct from the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Figure 19).<br>
EXAMPLE 14 Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody Bindinq Densitv and B Cell Depletion<br>
CD20 expression is quite heterogeneous in different lymphoma types, as well as among cells of an individual tumor sample, which may affect anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapeutic outcome (Smith (2003) Oncogene 22:7359-7368). Typically, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and small lymphocytic lymphoma cells express CD20 at low levels, with corresponding lower Rituximab response rates than follicular lymphoma cells expressing CD20 at higher levels (Mclaughlin, et al. (1998) J. Clin. Oncol, 16:2825-2833). Thus, CD20 expression density may be an important factor influencing anti-CD20 therapeutic efficacy since CD20 density dictates the number of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies that are able to bind B cells and target them for depletion. To assess whether CD20 expression density affects therapeutic efficacy and to determine the extent that density changes affect B cell depletion, heterozygous CD20"7' mice were treated with the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody at high (250 ug) and low (10 ug) doses. B cells from CD20*/" mice express CD20 at half the density found in wild-type littermates. At high anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody doses, wild-type or haplo-insufficient CD20 expression had no detectable influence on circulating or spleen B cell depletion by day 7, with 93-97% of B cells cleared from the spleen (Figure 20A and Figure 20B). By contrast, a low dose of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody effectively depleted 93-98% of circulating and spleen B cells from wild-type mice, but only removed 30-41% of circulating or spleen B cells from CD20+/" mice by day 7 (Figure 20A and Figure 20B). Thus, the effectiveness of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment was significantly altered by only<br><br>
a 50% decrease in B cell expression of CD20. Moreover, the density of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody binding to the surface of target B cells was critically influenced by cell surface CD20 density, particularly when lower monoclonal antibody concentrations were present.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
MB20-11 Monoclonal Antibody Binding and Cell Surface CD20<br>
Expression<br>
Cell surface CD20 expression density is an important factor for anti-CD20 therapeutic efficacy (Smith (2003) supra). Therefore, attempts have been made to upregulate CD20 expression during therapy to try to enhance anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody efficacy in vivo, such as treating patients with G- or GM-CSF. However, mechanisms other than CD20 upregulation are likely to account for the enhanced effects that have been observed (Ravetch and Lanier (2000) Leukemia 16:693-699; van der Kolk, et al. (2002) Leukemia 16:693-699). It has been demonstrated herein that MB20-11 monoclonal antibody is exceptionally effective in depleting mouse B cells in vivo (Figures 7-10). Although the in vivo effectiveness of the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody appears to result, in part, from the fact that it is of the lgG2a isotype, other factors are also likely to contribute therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the effect of MB20-11 monoclonal antibody-binding on cell surface CD20 expression by spleen B cells was assessed in vitro. Unexpectedly, binding of the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody to cultured B cells at 37UC induced binding of more MB20-11 monoclonal antibodies over time compared with cells kept on ice or incubated wilh olher MB20 monoclonal antibodies of similar or different isotypes (Figure 21; data no shown). On average, MB20-11 monoclonal antibody binding increased by 97ยฑ29% (n=4, p<q.q5 over a time period of minutes to hours increased mb20-11 monoclonal antibody binding with did not appear be related low affinity since the reached saturating levels s at concentrations similar other mb20 antibodies that induce cd20 expression on cell surface anti-mouse display this property data shown></q.q5><br>
monoclonal antibody may bind to a unique region or epitope on CD20. Binding of the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody to CD20 may either induce increased cell surface CD20 expression on B cells or induce conformational changes in cell surface CD20 molecules that expose nascent MB20-11 monoclonal antibody binding sites.<br>
EXAMPLE 16 Binding Densities of HB20-3. -4 and -25 Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
Monoclonal antibody binding density is critical for optimal anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody mediated B cell depletion in vivo (Figure 20) indicating that monoclonal antibodies that bind to B cells at higher densities may be more therapeutically effective. The MB20-18 monoclonal antibody bound to the surface of B cells at the highest density of the MB20 group of monoclonal antibodies, particularly when monoclonal antibody concentrations were limiting (Figure 6). This may have contributed to the particular effectiveness of the MB20-18 monoclonal antibody among other lgG2b anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for B cell depletion in vivo (Figure 7B). Based on the significant differences in their amino acid sequences, it is contemplated that the HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies in group CC (Table 1) have shared biological properties that are distinct from the shared properties of the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Figure 12). Among these differences, the HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies bound to primary B cells and B lymphoma cell lines expressing CD20 at significantly higher levels than the known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in indirect immunofluorescence staining assays (Figure 22). On average, the HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies bound to human blood B cells at 3.7-fold    . higher levels than the 1F5, B9E9 and 1H4 monoclonal antibodies (Table 6). Similarly, the HB20-3, -4 and -25 group of monoclonal antibodies bound to B cell lines, Raji, BJAB and DHL-4 at 4.5-, 3.1- and 4.3-fold higher levels, respectively, than the 1F5, B9E9 and 1H4 group of monoclonal antibodies. It was consistently observed that the B1 monoclonal antibody, which was the first described anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Stashenko, et al. (1980) J. Immunol. 125:1678), stains B cells and characteristically binds to B cells at high density when compared with other published anti-CD20 monoclonal<br><br>
antibodies (Table 6). Nonetheless, the HB20-3, -4 and -25 group of<br>
7<br>
'monoclonal antibodies reacted with primary B cells and B cell lines at higher levels than the B1 monoclonal antibody (Table 6). Specifically, the HB20-3 monoclonal antibody bound to primary B cells, Raji cells, BJAB cells and DHL-4 cells at 69%, 130%, 71%, arid 57%-nigher levels, respectively, than the B1 monoclonal antibody. Thus, a unique characteristic of group CC monoclonal antibodies is their uncharacteristically high binding activity for cell surface CD20 in comparison with other known anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.<br>
In addition to binding at a higher density as well as reacting with primary B cells and B cell lines at higher levels than the 1F5 monoclonal antibody, HB20-3, HB20-4 and HB20-25 share a common amino acid motif in the heavy chain CDR3 and CDR1 regions and in the light chain CDR3 region. The common motif is apparent in Figure 15 tor the heavy chain and Figure 18 for the light chain. For example, the heavy chain CDR3 region comprises the amino acid sequence motif of FYXYXXX'YGAX2XXY, wherein X can be any amino acid, and wherein X1 can be any amino acid and is preferably a Y or an S, and wherein X2can be any amino acid and is preferably an M or an L and wherein F is a Phenylalanine, Y is a Tyrosine, G is a Glycine, A is an Alanine, M is a methionine, L is a Leucine and S is a Serine.<br>
The heavy chain CDR1 region comprises the amino acid sequence motif of NXXXX wlioroin X 
Further, the light chain CDR3 region comprises the amino sequence motif of XHFWXX3XWX, wherein X can be any amino acid sequence, H is Histidine, F is a Phenylalanine, W is a Tryptophan and X3 can be any amino acid and is preferably a T or an I, wherein T is Threonine and I is Isoleucine.<br>

Reactivity of human blood lymphocytes and the Raji, BJAB or DHL-4 B lymphoblastoid cell lines with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies at saturating concentrations or with secondary antibody alone (control). The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies were used at concentrations that were determined to be saturating and that gave optimal staining. 1F5, B9E9 and 1H4 (lgG2a) monoclonal antibodies were used as ascites fluid diluted 1:200. HB20-3, -4 and -25 monoclonal antibodies were used as tissue culture supernatant fluid. B1 monoclonal antibody was used at either 10 ug/mL of purified monoclonal antibody or as tissue culture supernatant fluid. In all cases, monoclonal antibody staining was visualized using PE-conjugated isotype-specific secondary antibodies with flow cytometry analysis. Values represent the mean linear fluorescence intensity of staining for each B cell population as determined by flow cytometry analysis. Results are representative of those obtained in S3 experiments.<br>
EXAMPLE 17 Therapeutic Effectiveness of Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody<br>
Since the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody given at 2.5 ug doses i.v. effectively depleted circulating and tissue B cells (Figure 7C), it was determined whether similar small doses of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody given subcutaneously (s.c.) depleted B cells to an equivalent extent. The vast majority of circulating and tissue B cells were depleted in mice given anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies as 5 ug doses either i.v. or s.c. (Figure 23A and Figure 23B). Rituximab is normally given to humans i.v. at 375 mg/m2 doses, which would correspond to a dose of 2,500 ug/mouse (Table 7). Effective B cell depletion in mice was obtained by giving a single 5-10 ug dose of MB20-11 monoclonal antibody s.c., which would be equivalent to 250- to 500-fold lower an amount of antibody than the amount of rituximab that is currently given i.v. to patients. Based on the current mouse findings, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that was therapeutically comparable to the MB20-11 monoclonal antibody could effectively deplete both circulating and tissue B cells when given as 1.3-2.6 mg s.c. injections to humans.<br>
