Title of Invention<br>
ULTRAVIOLET CURABLE INKJET RECORDING INK AND<br>
COLOR IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an ultraviolet curable<br>
inkjet recording ink and a color image forming apparatus using<br>
the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Inkjet printing technology is used in a wide variety of<br>
image forming apparatuses for household use and industrial use.<br>
Home-use inkjet printers, which generally use a<br>
water-based ink, cannot achieve adequate image quality unless<br>
the recording medium used has high ink absorption property.<br>
On the other hand, industrial-use inkjet printers, using a<br>
solvent with rapid drying property and with high ability to<br>
penetrate recording media, perform printing on the types of<br>
recording medium on which images cannot be printed with<br>
water-based inks. In the latter case, however, the solvent used<br>
evaporates from the water-based ink, which causes problems of<br>
bad smell, dangerousness, and toxicity of the solvent. Though<br>
inks using less volatile solvents are available, however, the inks<br>
dry very slowly, causing problems of poor image quality and poor<br>
fixing property. Also available are hot melt inks, which are<br>
solid at room temperature, however, these are waxy inks, still<br>
causing problems of weak surface strength of fixed images and<br>
of wide variations in fixing property of the inks on different<br>
types of recording media.<br>
In contrast to these inks, ultraviolet curable inkjet<br>
recording inks, which use volatile solvents and smell less, are<br>
capable of forming images even on recording media without<br>
having ink absorption property and of increasing the process<br>
speed of forming images by shortening the fixing time.<br>
However, when a recording medium is not sufficiently wet with<br>
an ultraviolet curable inkjet ink, the ultraviolet curable inkjet<br>
ink does not spread over a surface of the recording medium,<br>
resulting in inadequate image quality and in degradation of<br>
fixing property due to the reduced contact area between the<br>
recording medium and the ink. Furthermore, when the ink<br>
layer thickness increases after printing with an ultraviolet<br>
curable inkjet ink, the amount of ultraviolet light reaching<br>
inside of the deposited ink layer becomes excessively small,<br>
causing curing failure of the deposited ink layer.<br>
In order to solve the above problems, an ultraviolet<br>
curable inkjet recording ink containing a fluorine surfactant<br>
which is capable of remarkably lowering the surface tension of<br>
the ultraviolet curable inkjet recording ink has been developed<br>
(Patent Literature 1; Patent Literature 2).<br>
However, since such fluorine surfactant does not possess<br>
the property of curing on exposure to ultraviolet light, bleeding<br>
of such fluorine surfactant takes place from a deposited layer of<br>
the ultraviolet curable inkjet recording ink after the deposited<br>
layer has been cured.<br>
In order to solve this problem, it is proposed to use<br>
fluoroalkyl acrylate or silicone acrylate in ultraviolet curable<br>
inkjet recording inks as a wetting enhancer which reacts with<br>
ultraviolet light to cure (Patent Literature 3,' Patent Literature<br>
4). Although bleeding of such wetting enhancers can be avoided<br>
by their ability to react with ultraviolet light to cure, such<br>
reactive wetting enhancers are inferior in improving the<br>
wettability to surfactants. When such reactive wetting<br>
enhancer added into an ultraviolet curable inkjet recording ink<br>
is greatly increased in amount to improve the wettability, a<br>
considerable amount of the reactive wetting enhancer molecules<br>
remain unreacted after the curing reaction, causing bleeding of<br>
the unreacted reactive wetting enhancer residue. The amount<br>
of the unreacted reactive wetting enhancer residue can be<br>
reduced by increasing the amount of a polymerization initiator<br>
or irradiated light. However, increasing the amount of the<br>
polymerization initiator may adversely influence the physical<br>
properties of the coated membrane after curing reaction and<br>
increase the toxicity of the ink before curing. Furthermore, in<br>
order to increase the amount of irradiated light, it is necessary<br>
to provide additional expensive ultraviolet lamps, which is<br>
undesirable in terms of cost and electric power consumption.<br>

Description of Embodiments<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention mentioned above is<br>
described in detail.<br>
An ultraviolet curable inkjet recording ink according to<br>
the present invention contains at least one fluorine surfactant<br>
represented by one of the above structural formulae (1) and (2)<br>
as a surface tension regulator.<br>
These compounds are characterized in that they contain a<br>
polyvalent alcohol with a relatively short fluoroalkyl chain (Rf)<br>
as a basic structural unit, have at least an oligomeric part in<br>
which one to several tens (as n, k, and m indicate) of the basic<br>
structural unit(s) is/are ether-linked, and have a functional<br>
group (R1 or R2) capable of initiating an ultraviolet curing<br>
reaction. Note that each fluorine surfactant is a mixture of<br>
polymer compounds whose number of repeating times of<br>
repetitive structural units is different from each other. A value<br>
represented by n, k, m, or 1 is an average value of the number of<br>
repeating times of respective repetitive basic structural units.<br>
In general, a fluoroalkyl chain of a fluorine surfactant<br>
molecule is hydrophobic and lipophobic, and other part of the<br>
fluorine surfactant molecule is solvophilic. As the fluoroalkyl<br>
chain selected to be introduced into the fluorine surfactant<br>
molecule becomes longer, the hydrophobicity/lipophobicity of the<br>
part of the fluorine surfactant molecule is increased which, in<br>
combination with solvophilicity of other part of the fluorine<br>
surfactant molecule, strengthens the capability of surface<br>
activation and may increase thereby the wettability of the ink.<br>
When the wettability of an ink is excessively high, however, the<br>
ink may excessively wet the orifice part of an Inkjet head.<br>
Considering the balance of these factors of the fluoroalkyl chain<br>
length, a fluoroalkyl group used in a fluorine surfactant of the<br>
present invention is one of CH2CF3 and CH2CF2CF3.<br>
When uniform surface state in the vicinity of an orifice<br>
part of an inkjet head is not maintained, an ink is ejected in<br>
undesirable direction, resulting in abnormal ejection.<br>
Consequently the orifice part is treated with a superhydrophobic<br>
solvent so as to maintain the uniform surface state. When an<br>
ink having very high wettability is used, however, the orifice<br>
part is wetted so much that the effect of the hydrophobic solvent<br>
treatment is cancelled, leading to irregular wetting state of the<br>
surface of the orifice part to cause ejection deviation of the ink.<br>
Though a fluorine surfactant used in the present<br>
invention has a shorter fluorine chain than those conventional<br>
fluorine surfactants and therefore is inferior in wettability to<br>
the conventional fluorine surfactants, the fluorine surfactant<br>
used in the present invention is capable of lowering surface<br>
tension of an ink much better than silicon surfactants and<br>
therefore still has adequate capability for improving the<br>
wettability of the ink with a surface of a recording medium.<br>
Furthermore, though problems with the ejection quality cannot<br>
be overlooked in inks using conventional fluorine surfactants,<br>
when the fluorine surfactant of the present invention is used in<br>
an ink, the ejection quality of the ink is improved, compared to<br>
the ejection quality of the inks using conventional fluorine<br>
surfactants.<br>
As to perfluorooctanoic acids (PFOA), there is concern for<br>
their bioaccumulative properties and toxicity.<br>
Perfluorooctanoic acids differ in biodegradation property<br>
depending on the chain length of the perfluoroalkyl group<br>
thereof, and it is known that the shorter the chain length of the<br>
perfluoroalkyl group is, the more rapid the biodegradation of the<br>
perfluorooctanocic acid is. In natural degradation process<br>
perfluoroalkylether surfactants are oxidized to be perfluoroalkyl<br>
acids via perfluoroalkyl alcohols. Therefore, a natural<br>
degradation product of a fluorine surfactant having a long<br>
fluoroalkyl chain is highly likely to be bioaccumulated, and thus<br>
the use of a fluorine surfactant having a short fluoroalkyl chain<br>
is also preferable in terms of safety.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention an oligomeric<br>
surfactant is used, which reduces the amounts of foaming and<br>
gas inclusion of ink, reduces the amount of foam introduced into<br>
a head, and increases the amount of the ink that can be charged.<br>
The mechanism how the use of the oligomeric surfactant reduces<br>
the amounts of foaming and gas inclusion of ink is uncertain,<br>
however, the mechanism may possibly be explained as follows:<br>
since a low-molecular-weight surfactant molecule has a high<br>
degree of freedom of movement, the fluoroalkyl chains of the<br>
low-molecular-weight surfactant molecules freely diffuse to<br>
uniformly locate on the interface, reducing the surface tension of<br>
the interface entirely. In contrast, fluoroalkyl chains of an<br>
oligomeric surfactant molecule are bound in each monomer unit<br>
in the oligomeric surfactant molecule, which makes the<br>
fluoroalkyl chains of oligomeric surfactant molecules more<br>
locally locate on the interface than in the case of fluoroalkyl<br>
chains of the low-molecular-weight surfactant, reducing the<br>
surface tension of the interface more or less irregularly in the<br>
microscopic sense. Since a bubble becomes more stable as the<br>
surface tension of its gas-liquid interface becomes lower and<br>
more uniform, the difference in uniformity of surface tension<br>
between the interfaces activated by the lowmolecular-weight<br>
surfactants and by the oligomeric surfactants in the microscopic<br>
sense is presumed to cause difference in intensity of the foaming<br>
and gas inclusion property between these surfactants.<br>
Lowmolecular-weight surfactant molecules each contain<br>
about one to two polar group(s), which may be the same or<br>
different when existing in plurality, and fulfill their function by<br>
alignment of their molecule bodies according to the polarity of<br>
the interface. However, the lowmolecular-weight surfactant<br>
molecules do not adequately fulfill their function when they do<br>
not align and exist singly. A typical example of structure of a<br>
lowmolecular-weight surfactant molecule is depicted in FIG.2.<br>
In contrast, polymeric surfactant molecules, including<br>
oligomeric surfactant molecules, each contain a number of polar<br>
groups, which may be the same or different, and fulfill their<br>
function by alignment of the polar groups in the molecule<br>
according to the polarity of the interface. Since the polymeric<br>
surfactant molecules are large and indeterminate in shape, it is<br>
not necessary for them to be aligned on the interface in a<br>
regular manner for fulfilling their function, and even a single<br>
molecule thereof can adequately fulfill the function. A typical<br>
example of structure of a polymeric surfactant molecule is<br>
depicted in FIG.3.<br>
When a surfactant has a basic structural unit containing<br>
a fluoroalkyl group(s) such as represented by one of the above<br>
structural formulae (1) and (2), the surfactant may achieve a<br>
passable effect. When 'n' of the basic structural unit of fluorine<br>
surfactants is less than 5, however, the fluorine surfactants<br>
reduce the capability of surface activation so much that they<br>
cannot be used. When the 'n' of fluorine surfactants is more<br>
than 20, the molecular weight of the fluorine surfactants<br>
becomes so large that the moving speed of the fluorine<br>
surfactant molecules to an interface is decreased. Consequently,<br>
the wetting speed by the inks containing the fluorine<br>
surfactants is decreased so much that they cannot adequately<br>
fulfill their function as surfactants in inkjet inks and that<br>
therefore cannot be used in inkjet inks. Considering these<br>
factors, the range of the 'n' is from 5 to 20.<br>
Similarly, when one of 'k' and 'm' is less than 1, the<br>
capability of surface activation of fluorine surfactants becomes<br>
so low that the fluorine surfactants cannot be used. When one<br>
of the 'k' and 'm' is more than 8, the molecular weights of<br>
fluorine surfactants become so large that the fluorine<br>
surfactants cannot adequately fulfill their function as<br>
surfactants and that they cannot be used. Considering these<br>
factors, the range of the 'k' or 'm' is from 1 to 8.<br>
T may be suitably controlled in accordance with a solvent<br>
used in an ink and is typically a value of about 1 to 20.<br>
Note that the average degree of polymerization of a<br>
fluorine surfactant in an ink can be measured with LC/MS<br>
(Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry).<br>
Furthermore, when a functional group capable of<br>
initiating an ultraviolet curing reaction is introduced into a<br>
surfactant component, bleeding of the surfactant component<br>
after ink's curing on exposure to ultraviolet light, as well as<br>
associated degradation of fixing property and change of physical<br>
properties of printed surfaces can be prevented. In multi-color<br>
printing, in which different monochrome inks are printed one at<br>
a time and each deposited monochrome ink is cured immediately<br>
after it has been printed, bleeding of a monochrome ink is<br>
caused on an interface with an area of another monochrome ink,<br>
leading to changes in density or hue of a printed matter, which<br>
results in degradation of stability of the formed images with<br>
time.<br>
When an additive which does not react with ultraviolet<br>
light to cure and which interacts with a surfactant is contained<br>
in an ink, bleeding of the additive is accelerated by the<br>
surfactant. When an additive for improving light resistance<br>
and plasticity of a coated membrane is used, the bleeding of the<br>
additive causes degradation of the light resistance and the<br>
plasticity of a coated membrane.<br>
Two systems of ultraviolet curing reaction are generally<br>
used, that is, a system of radical polymerization which uses a<br>
photoradical initiator, and a system of cationic polymerization<br>
which uses a photoacid initiator.<br>
A reactive functional group suitable for a system of<br>
radical polymerization is, for example, a functional group having<br>
an unsaturated hydrocarbon chain. Preferably, the reactive<br>
functional group suitable for a system of radical polymerization<br>
is a functional group having a group selected from vinyl group,<br>
isopropenyl group, allyl group, methallyl group, acryloyl group,<br>
methacryloyl group, propioloyl group, and maleoyl group. More<br>
preferably, the reactive functional group suitable for a system of<br>
radical polymerization is a group represented by the structural<br>
formula (3).<br>
A reactive functional group suitable for a system of<br>
cationic polymerization is, for example, a functional group<br>
having a vinyl aromatic part, a vinyl ether part, a vinyl amide<br>
part, or an oxygen-containing heterocyclic ring. Preferably the<br>
reactive functional group suitable for a system of cationic<br>
polymerization is a functional group having an epoxy group or<br>
an oxetanyl group, and more preferably is, in terms of reactivity,<br>
a 3-ethyl -oxetanyl-methyl group represented by the structural<br>
formula (4) or a 3-(3-ethyl-oxetanyl-methoxy)-2-hydroxypropane<br>
group represented by the structural formula (5). Including any<br>
one of these functional groups in a fluorine surfactant molecule<br>
also contributes to improvement of wettability to a recording<br>
medium, the balance between the wettability of the ink and the<br>
ink-repellency of an orifice part of an inkjet head, and<br>
improvement of ink filling property realizable by reducing the<br>
amount of foaming.<br>
Examples of a commercially available fluorine surfactant<br>
which can be used in the present invention include POLYFOX<br>
PF-3305, POLYFOX PF-3510, and POLYFOX PF-3320<br>
(manufactured by OMNOVA SOLUTIONS INC) which each has a<br>
group represented by the structural formula (3). A fluorine<br>
surfactant which can be used in the present invention may also<br>
be synthesized from PF-636, PF-6320, PF-656, or PF-6520<br>
(manufactured by OMNOVA SOLUTIONS INC) which is used as<br>
a starting material and provided with an oxetanyl group<br>
according to JP-B Nos. 3882486, 3307260, and 4003264 (see<br>
compound A mentioned below).<br>
The amount of a fluorine surfactant contained in the ink<br>
is desirably 0.01% by mass to 10% by mass. The amount of<br>
fluorine surfactant is preferably 0.05% by mass to 10% by mass<br>
in terms of providing good wettability of the ink to a recording<br>
medium, and is preferably 0.01% by mass to 2% by mass in<br>
terms of providing good ejection stability of an inkjet head.<br>
When the amount is less than 0.01% by mass, an adequate effect<br>
may not be fulfilled in terms of providing good wettability with a<br>
recording medium. When the amount is more than 10% by<br>
mass, ejection stability is degraded, as well as fixing property of<br>
printed images may be degraded. Furthermore, since the<br>
fluorine surfactant according to the present invention is inferior<br>
in reactivity to a general monomer, an unreacted surfactant<br>
residue may be left and quality of printed matter may be<br>
degraded with bleeding of the fluorine surfactant residue when<br>
the fluorine surfactant is used excessively.<br><ink physical property><br>
An ink according to the present invention preferably has<br>
a viscosity of 5 mPa•s to 30 mPa•s, and more preferably has a<br>
viscosity of 5 mPa•s to 20 mPa•s at a temperature at the time of<br>
ejection. In order to eject an ink having a high viscosity, it is<br>
necessary to increase ejection power of an inkjet head. When<br>
an ink having a viscosity more than 30 mPa-s is ejected, in an<br>
inkjet head using a piezoelectric element, it is necessary to<br>
increase the voltage applied between piezoelectric elements,<br>
which often causes a problem of leak of electric current, etc. In<br>
addition, it is difficult to separate the ink having a high<br>
viscosity into independent ink droplets at the time of ink<br>
ejection, and resulting in poor shapes of ink droplets often with<br>
tails. Thus abnormal particulation, such as generation of ink<br>
mist or separation of satellites, is easy to occur. In contrast,<br>
since an ink having a low viscosity often has poor shapes of ink<br>
droplets and poor frequency characteristics, the viscosity of the<br>
ink having a low viscosity is desirably 5 mPa•s or more for<br>
maintaining a high frequency characteristic.<br>
In order to decrease the viscosity of an ink at the time of<br>
ejection, a head or an ink supply system may be heated at about<br>
40°C to 80°C to decrease the viscosity of the ink for ejection,<br>
however, for achieving this it is necessary to heat not only an<br>
ink ejection part but also an ink supply system. Control of<br>
temperature at the ink ejection part including a head is<br>
desirably carried out separately from the ink supply system such<br>
that particularly an ink temperature at the ink ejection part is<br>
stabilized.<br>
The ink according to the present invention desirably has<br>
a surface tension at a temperature of ejection of 20 mN/m to 29<br>
mN/m. More desirably the ink has a surface tension at a<br>
temperature of ejection of 23 mN/m to 26 mN/m. When the<br>
surface tension at a temperature of ejection is smaller than<br>
20mN/m, the ejection becomes unstable. When the surface<br>
tension is more than 29 mN/m, wettability of an ink with a<br>
recording medium becomes inadequate.<br>
It is preferable that an ink exhibiting Newtonian fluid<br>
behavior at temperatures at which it is used is used, however, so<br>
long as the ink satisfies the above conditions at share speeds at<br>
which ordinary measurements were carried out (about 20 rpm to<br>
100 rpm), the ink can be used without problem even when the<br>
apparent viscosity of the ink more or less depends on the share<br>
speed.<br><ink constituent material><br>
The ink according to the present invention contains a<br>
colorant, a light-curable compound, and a photopolymerization<br>
initiator, and further contains the fluorine surfactant as a<br>
surface tension regulator. Further, it is possible to incorporate<br>
in the ink a sensitizer, a photostabilizing agent, a slipping agent,<br>
a surface-treating agent, a viscosity reducer, an antioxidant, an<br>
antiaging agent, a cross-linking promoter, a polymerization<br>
inhibitor, a plasticizer, a preservative, a dispersant, a leveling<br>
agent, water, and a solvent, etc.<br><colorant><br>

used.<br>
For a black pigment, C.I. Pigment Black 7, 28, or 26, etc.<br>
can be used.<br>
The absorbance by an ink of a wave length of ultraviolet<br>
light which is required for curing the ink varies depending on<br>
the type of a colorant contained in the ink, which results in<br>
variations in ultraviolet curing property of an ink depending on<br>
the type of a colorant contained in the ink. Consequently, the<br>
amount of a colorant is discretionally determined according to<br>
the output of an ultraviolet lamp used and the coloring power of<br>
the colorant. Usually, the amount added is appropriately one<br>
part by mass to 30 parts by mass. When the amount added is<br>
less than one part by mass, image quality produced by the ink<br>
using the colorant is degraded. When the amount added is<br>
more than 30 parts by mass, ultraviolet curing property and ink<br>
viscosity property are adversely affected. For adjustment of<br>
color, etc. two types or more of the colorants may be<br>
appropriately mixed for use.<br><light-curable compound><br>
A light-curable compound which can be used in the<br>
present invention accounts for 10% by mass to 70% by mass of<br>
the total amount of the ink constituent materials. The<br>
light-curable compound that can be used in the present<br>
invention is different depending on the type of light curing<br>
reaction, that is, whether it is used in a system of radical<br>
polymerization using a photoradical initiator or in a system of<br>
cationic polymerization using a photoacid initiator.<br>
However, it is also possible to use a mixture of a system<br>
of radical polymerization and that of cationic polymerization and<br>

according to curing property or adhesion strength and image<br>
forming process of a light-curable compound.<br>

lactone compound, such as ß-propiolactone and e-caprolactone;<br>
thiirane compound, such as ethylene sulfide and<br>
thioepichlorohydrin; a thiethane compound, such as 1,3-propyne<br>
sulfide and 3,3-dimethylthiethane; a cyclic thioether compound,<br>
such as a tetrahydrothiophene derivative; and a spiro ortho<br>
ester compound obtained by reacting an epoxy compound with<br>
lactone.<br>
The above-mentioned light-curable compounds of systems<br>
of cationic polymerization may be used alone or as a mixture of<br>
two or more types.<br>
For a photopolymerization initiator of a system of cationic<br>
polymerization, a photoacid-generating agent which is generally<br>
used in light cationic polymerization may be used. An example<br>
of the photoacid-generating agent includes a double salt that is<br>
an onium salt generating a Lewis acid or a derivative of the<br>
double salt.<br>
An example of an onium salt includes a salt consisting of<br>
a cation which is obtained by linking an atom or an atomic group<br>
selected from the group consisting of S, N, Se, Te, P, As, Sb, Bi,<br>
O, I, Br, Cl, F, and N=N with (an) organic group(s), at least one<br>
of which contains an aromatic ring, and an anion which is any<br>
one of tetrafluoroborate (BF4-), tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)<br>
borate (B(C6F5)4-), hexafluorophosphate (PF6-),<br>
hexafluoroantimonate (SbF6-), hexafluoroarsenate (AsF6-), and<br>
hexachloroantimonate (SbCl6-).<br>
For a light cation polymerization initiator, a sulfonated<br>
compound which generates a sulfonic acid, a halide which<br>
generates a hydrogen halide with light, and also an iron-allene<br>
complex may be used.<br><recording medium><br>
Recording media on which images are formed with the<br>
ink according to the present invention are not particularly<br>
limited and are, for example, paper, thread, fiber, fabric, leather,<br>
metal, plastic, glass, wood, and ceramics.<br>
Even when the ink according to the present invention is<br>
used for forming an image on an ink-nonabsorbable recording<br>
medium, it is possible to obtain a print image having<br>
significantly improved image quality.<br>
Examples of the ink nonabsorbable recording medium<br>
include plastic, glass, metal, and ceramics, and the effect of the<br>
ink according to the present invention may be readily achieved<br>
when images are formed on ink-repellent plastics.<br>
The plastic is not particularly limited; examples thereof<br>
include a polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, ionomer resin,<br>
polyvinyliden chloride, polypropylene, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polycarbonate, polyester, polyacrylonitrile, acrylic resin, ABS,<br>
polyacetal, polystyrene, cellophane, and copolymer with<br>
ethylene.<br>
It is possible to form an image on three-dimensionally<br>
molded materials of the above materials. However, when any<br>
one of the above materials is made into a film by melt extrusion,<br>
solution casting, or calendaring and when images are to be<br>
formed on a surface thereof, it becomes possible to precisely<br>
position a head to a recording medium, which results in<br>
achievement of excellent image quality according to a printing<br>
speed.<br>
However, since a local surface energy of these plastics<br>
greatly varies, the dot diameter after ink landing may vary due<br>
to ink-repellency of the plastic. However, when the ink of the<br>
present invention, which has an excellent wettability to a<br>
recording medium, is used, the dot diameter of the ink does not<br>
greatly vary even on any one of these plastics to provide<br>
excellent image quality.<br><ultraviolet curable inkjet recording apparatus><br>
The ink according to the present invention can be used in<br>
one of a serial type inkjet recording apparatus and a line type<br>
inkjet recording apparatus, where in the former apparatus a<br>
head is displaced with respect to a recording medium which<br>
moves intermittently according to the head width and thereby<br>
the ink is ejected to the recording medium, and in the latter<br>
apparatus an ink is ejected onto a recording medium from a<br>
head which is held on a constant position.<br>
Hereinafter, an example of a line type inkjet recording<br>
apparatus in which the ink of the present invention can be used<br>
will be described with reference to FIG.l.<br>
A recording medium sheet 10 is separated one by one by<br>
a separation roller 11 from a paper supply section 2, pressed to<br>
and sucked on, by a paper supply roller 12, a feeding belt 1<br>
stretched over a matched pair of feeding rollers 14, and fed by<br>
the feeding belt 1. A sucking platen 15 is depressurized with a<br>
sucking fan 16 to suck the recording medium sheet on a surface<br>
of the feeding belt which has a number of pores. On the<br>
recording medium sheet, which is sucked on the feeding belt and<br>
fed, inkjet heads 5-8 in a carriage 3 form multi-color images,<br>
which are exposed to ultraviolet light from an ultraviolet lamp<br>
17 in an exposing unit 4 to be cured and fixed. The printed<br>
matter is discharged via a paper discharge roller 13 to a stacker<br>
9.<br>
The inkjet recording apparatus may be equipped with a<br>
light reflector 18 for reflecting light from the ultraviolet lamp to<br>
a recording medium sheet surface, or an exhaust system in<br>
which air over the recording medium sheet, which is heated by<br>
the ultraviolet lamp and by ozone gas produced through effects<br>
of ultraviolet light, is sucked by a sucking fan 19 for cooling and<br>
thus sucked air is discharged while toxic gas therein being<br>
adsorbed by an exhaust filter 20.<br><inkjet head><br>
Examples of the inkjet head include a recording head<br>
using a piezoelectric element, a recording head using a heater<br>
element, and a recording head using forces of electrostatic<br>
attraction. Among these, the recording head using a<br>
piezoelectric element is preferred in terms of ejecting ability and<br>
freedom of ink composition.<br>
Nozzle surfaces of such inkjet heads are desirably<br>
treated so as to have ink-repellency. Methods for treating<br>
nozzle surfaces to provide ink-repellency may include vapor<br>
deposition of an ink-repellent material, application of an<br>
ink-repellent material, and plating of an ink-repellent material,<br>
and may be selected depending on the properties of the<br>
ink-repellent material and the constituent material of the nozzle<br>
surfaces.<br>
Examples of a material having ink-repellency include a<br>
fluorine compound and a silicone resin. Among these, a PTFE<br>
treatable by eutectoid plating and a silane compound having a<br>
vapor depositable perfluoroalkyl are desired in terms of the<br>
strength of an ink-repellent layer and ink-repellency.<br><ink supply device><br>
An ink supply device for supplying the ink to an inkjet<br>
head is composed of an ink tank, a pump for sending liquid, a<br>
tube for sending liquid, packing, a heater, and a thermal<br>
insulation member. It is necessary that the surfaces of these<br>
members making contact with the ink have adequate resistance<br>
to the ink.<br>
Since the ink hardens in a supply line when ultraviolet<br>
light is not blocked from reaching the ink, it is necessary that<br>
the ink supply device has light blocking ability. Also it is<br>
necessary that from the ink supply device a substance that<br>
causes curing reaction, such as metal ion, be not eluted into the<br>
ink. Further, it is also necessary to prevent contamination<br>
with a substance that inhibits curing. Examples of the<br>
substance that inhibits curing include oxygen gas for an ink of a<br>
system of radical polymerization and water for an ink of a<br>
system of cationic polymerization. Therefore, in order to<br>
prevent contamination by such substance, it is necessary to use<br>
members having permeability of air/moisture at a certain level<br>
or less.<br>
Available ranges of physical properties of these members<br>
may be discretionally set depending on conditions of user's use<br>
of the ink. When the ink is used under different conditions<br>
from the conditions of user's use of the ink, however, failures<br>
which markedly impair reliability of the ink, such as ink<br>
clogging, may occur.<br><ultraviolet curing lamp><br>
The duration of time from the ink ejection to the<br>
ultraviolet curing/fixation of the ink is not particularly limited;<br>
however, is preferably one second or less for efficient use of the<br>
ink of the present invention. Since as the duration of time from<br>
the ink ejection to the ultraviolet curing of the ink becomes<br>
longer a resulting image formed on a recording medium is<br>
blurred by ink exudation or discolored (unevenly colored), it is<br>
desirable to cure the ink as soon as possible for forming an<br>
excellent image with an ultraviolet curable ink.<br>
Examples of a light irradiation device for curing<br>
image-forming ink droplets include ultraviolet (UV) irradiation<br>
lamp and electron beam generator. The UV irradiation lamp,<br>
which may deform a recording medium by its heat, is desirably<br>
equipped with a cooling unit, such as cold mirror, cold filter, and<br>
work cooling unit.<br>
Examples of type of the lamp include electrode lamps or<br>
electrodeless lamps using high pressure mercury vapor,<br>
ultrahigh pressure mercury vapor, or metal halide vapor, etc.,<br>
and UV-LEDs. The lamp which can be used is not particularly<br>
limited, so long as it is effective in curing the ink, and a<br>
combination of the lamps having different wavelengths or two or<br>
more lamps belonging to the same lamp product may be used.<br>
An example of these lamps includes a commercially available<br>
lamp system, manufactured by Fusion UV Systems, Inc.,<br>
containing an "H" lamp, "D" lamp, and "V" lamp.<br>
Furthermore, it is also effective to use a hot air drying<br>
device equipped in parallel for speeding up image formation or<br>
to deposit an oxygen impermeable membrane, such as a<br>
polyvinyl alcohol membrane, over an image which is exposed to<br>
ultraviolet light through the membrane with the curing<br>
efficiency thereof being enhanced.<br>
The accumulated amount of light received by the surface<br>
of a recording medium is inversely related to the speed at which<br>
the recording medium is conveyed under the irradiated region by<br>
the light source. The accumulated amount of light for the<br>
wavelength range of UVA (320 n m to 390 n m) is preferably 200<br>
mJ/cm2 to 1,500 mJ/cm2, more preferably 200 mJ/cm2 to 1,000<br>
mJ/cm2, and particularly preferably 200 mJ/cm2 to 800 mJ/cm2.<br>
When the accumulated amount of light for the UVA<br>
wavelength range is less than 200 mJ/cm2, an image having a<br>
thick ink membrane thickness of more than 30 µm may often<br>
remain uncured. When the accumulated amount of light is<br>
more than 1,500 mJ/cm2, it is unsuitable for high speed<br>
recording and heat is generated to deform the recording medium<br>
on which an image is formed.<br>
The effective ultraviolet light intensity for the UVA<br>
wavelength range is 3,000 mW/cm2 to 5,000 mW/cm2, preferably<br>
3,000 mW/cm2 to 4,800 mW/cm2, and more preferably 3,200<br>
mW/cm2 to 4,700 mW/cm2. When an ultraviolet light intensity<br>
for the UVA wavelength range is less than 3,000 mW/cm2, the<br>
ink cures inadequately. When the ultraviolet light intensity for<br>
the UVA wavelength range is more than 5,000 mW/cm2, the cost<br>
of an image forming apparatus using the ultraviolet lamp often<br>
becomes expensive as elaboration of the apparatus and of the<br>
ink formulation costs high.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is further specifically<br>
described by presenting Examples and Comparative Examples,<br>
however, the scope of the present invention is not limited to<br>
these Examples. Note that in the Examples and the<br>
Comparative Examples, "part(s)" and "%" means "part(s) by<br>
mass" and "% by mass", respectively.<br>
(Examples 1 to 10 and Comparative Examples 1 to 5)<br><pretreatment of pigment><br>
Into a pressure type kneader, 250 parts of each pigment<br>
powder specified in Table 1, 2,500 parts of sodium chloride, and<br>
160 parts of polyethylene glycol 300 were put and kneaded for<br>
three hours.<br>
Subsequently, this mixture was put in 3 L of warm water,<br>
stirred by a homomixer at about 80°C for about one hour to<br>
obtain slurry, then the slurry was filtered and washed with<br>
water with the filtration and washing treatment being repeated<br>
five times, and the resulting slurry was spray-dried to prepare a<br>
pretreated pigment.<br><preparation of ink><br>
Each of the above-mentioned pretreated pigments, each<br>
of dispersants, and each of light-curable compounds were put in<br>
a sand mill as specified in Table 1 and dispersed thereby for 4 hr.<br>
Subsequently, each of photopolymerization initiators and each of<br>
fluorine surfactants were added to the resulting dispersion as<br>
specified in Table 1 and gently mixed, so as not to incorporate<br>
air bubbles, till the photopolymerization initiator was dissolved,<br>
to prepare an ink stock solution.<br>
This ink stock solution was filtered under pressure<br>
through a membrane filter to prepare an inkjet recording ink to<br>
be used in the evaluation tests. The amount of each component<br>
incorporated in the inkjet recording ink is indicated in Table 1.<br>
The chemical structure of each fluorine surfactant<br>
indicated in Table 1 is as follows.<br>
(1) The basic chemical structure of POLYFOX PF3305,<br>
PF3510, and PF3320 is indicated by (6).<br>
where n is 5 for PF3305, 10 for PF3510, and 20 for PF3320.<br>
(2) The chemical structure of POLYFOX PF656 is<br>
indicated by (7).<br><br>
(3) MEGAFACE F-178K is an oligomer containing a<br>
perfluoroalkyl group/lipophilic group diluted by 30% in mineral<br>
spirits, and its precise chemical structure is unknown.<br>
However, as far as it is known, it is not such an oligomer having<br>
a chemical structure with repeating chains of oxetane origin as<br>
POLYFOX PF656.<br>
(4) Compound A is a fluorine surfactant provided with a<br>
group capable of initiating cationic polymerization, and has<br>
chemical structure indicated by (8). The fluorine surfactant<br>
was provided with the group capable of initiating cationic<br>
polymerization by following the procedure in accordance with<br>
JP-B No.3882486.<br>
Into a 500-mL glass round-bottom flask equipped with a<br>
stirrer, a dropping funnel, a thermometer, a diversion tube, and<br>
a condenser, 40.39 g (0.3 mol) of 3-chloromethyl-3-ethyloxetane<br>
and 142.32 g (0.1 mol) of POLYFOX PF656 were put, and, while<br>
stirring the mixture, 12.27 g of an aqueous solution containing<br>
48% by mass KOH (corresponds to 0.105 mol of KOH) was<br>
dripped into the mixture for 30 min. After the drip of the<br>
aqueous solution containing KOH had been completed, the<br>
resulting mixture was heated to 120°C. While the pressure in<br>
the system was controlled at about 600 mmHg with an aspirator,<br>
water in the resulting mixture was distilled away by azeotropic<br>
distillation for 12 hr, during which time the resulting mixture<br>
was reacted. Subsequently, precipitated salts in the resulting<br>
mixture were dissolved by addition of 50 mL pure water so that<br>
the resulting diluted mixture was separated into aqueous and<br>
organic phases, and then, the organic phase was collected.<br>
Further, a cleaning procedure in which 50 mL pure water was<br>
added to the collected organic phase, the resulting dilution being<br>
fully mixed and separated into aqueous and organic phases, with<br>
the organic phase being collected for the next repetition of the<br>
procedure, was repeated three times to prepare 152 g of a<br>
cleaned organic phase.<br>
where n is 6.<br><printing method><br>
The inkjet recording apparatus of FIG. 1 using a<br>
piezoelectric inkjet head capable of controlling ink temperatures<br>
from the ink supply system to the head was charged with each<br>
inkjet recording ink of Examples and Comparative Examples,<br>
and images were recorded under the following conditions:<br>
temperature: controlled such that the ink viscosity became 10<br>
mPa•s; ink ejection speed: 3 kHz; and feeding speed of a<br>
recording medium: 20 m/min. Subsequently, the images were<br>
cured by exposing them to ultraviolet light, which was<br>
irradiated from a metal halide lamp, at an accumulated amount<br>
of light of 1,500 mJ/cm2.<br>
For a recording medium, a polyethylene terephthalate<br>
(PET) film having a film thickness of 125 µm without surface<br>
treatment was used.<br>
In order to select a heating condition at the time of<br>
printing, the temperature at which the ink viscosity becomes<br>
10.0 + 0.5 mPa•s was determined by means of an E type<br>
viscometer capable of controlling temperatures.<br><curability><br>
Solid images of an average membrane thickness of 10 µm<br>
were printed on recording media with the inkjet recording<br>
apparatus. The central area of the printed image was rubbed<br>
with a finger through a cotton cloth, and the degree to which<br>
portions of the printed image peeled off from the recording<br>
medium and was transferred to the cotton cloth was visually<br>
evaluated. Evaluation criteria were as follows:<br>
A: No portion of the image peeled off or was transferred<br>
to the cotton cloth.<br>
B: The image surface was scratched and some portion of<br>
the image was transferred to the cotton cloth.<br>
C: The image was damaged and a large portion of the<br>
image was transferred to the cotton cloth.<br><evaluation of printing><br>
Copies of a Chinese character "todoroki", which means<br>
"boom", were printed in 6-point, MS gothic letters on recording<br>
media with the inkjet recording apparatus, and broken letter<br>
configuration or jaggy of the letters due to ink-repellency of the<br>
recording media was visually evaluated with the aid of a<br>
microscope. Evaluation criteria were as follows:<br>
A: Letters were clearly readable.<br>
B: Slightly poor resolution/jaggy of letters was seen,<br>
however, letters were still readable.<br>
C: Letters were unreadable.<br><evaluation of adhesion><br>
Solid images of an average membrane thickness of 10 µm<br>
were printed on recording media with the inkjet recording<br>
apparatus. The printed solid patterns on recording media were<br>
scratched in a pattern of lattice having a pitch of 1mm and<br>
tested for their adhesion on the recording media using a Scotch<br>
tape in accordance with JIS K5600-5-6.<br>
The evaluation was performed twice; one was carried out<br>
immediately after printing and the other was after a period in<br>
which bleeding of uncured surfactant molecules in the ink had<br>
been accelerated by leaving the recording media with the<br>
printed images for two weeks at 50°C in a thermostatic chamber.<br>
For the evaluation criteria, classification of test results<br>
indicated in Table 1 in 8.3 of JIS K5600-5-6 (1999) was adopted,<br>
that is:<br>
A: Classification 0<br>
B: Classification 1<br>
C: Other than A or B<br><evaluation of glossiness><br>
Solid images of an average membrane thickness of 10 µm<br>
were printed on recording media with the inkjet recording<br>
apparatus, and the degree of glossiness of the solid images was<br>
visually evaluated. The evaluation was performed twice; one<br>
was carried out immediately after printing and the other was<br>
after a period in which bleeding of uncured surfactant molecules<br>
in the ink had been accelerated by leaving the recording media<br>
with the printed images for two weeks at 50°C in a thermostatic<br>
chamber. Evaluation criteria were as follows:<br>
A: Solid areas were even and glossy.<br>
B: Solid areas were dull, or their surfaces were uneven<br>
and less glossy.<br><ejection stability><br>
Ink ejection from a head was inspected using an ink<br>
particle formation observing device after the ink had been<br>
continuously ejected for 6 hr at an ejection speed of 10 kHz, and<br>
occurrences of nozzle malfunction and ejection deviation from<br>
the normal ink ejection direction were counted for evaluating<br>
ejection stability. Evaluation criteria were as follows^<br>
A: Nozzle malfunction or ejection deviation did not occur.<br>
B: Nozzle malfunction did not occur; however, ejection<br>
deviations occurred in less than 5% of the cases inspected.<br>
C: Nozzle malfunction occurred in some cases, and<br>
ejection deviations occurred in 5% or more of the cases<br>
inspected.<br>
The results of the above-mentioned evaluation tests are<br>
summarized in Table 2.<br>
As can be seen in Table 2, all the inks of Examples 1 to<br>
10 could achieve all of excellent curability of the inks, excellent<br>
printed image quality, excellent adhesion, excellent glossiness of<br>
the images, and excellent ejection stability.<br>
As to the printed image quality, it is considered that the<br>
ink containing the fluorine surfactant of the present invention<br>
could wet even a hydrophobic PET film widely enough to achieve<br>
the predetermined image quality criterion.<br>
As to the adhesion of inks, adhesion of inks of Examples<br>
and Comparative Examples was acceptable immediately after<br>
printing, however, after bleeding of surfactants had been<br>
accelerated by heating, adhesion degraded in the inks whose<br>
surfactants were not polymerizable on exposure to ultraviolet<br>
light.<br>
Further as to the glossiness of images, inks which had<br>
inadequate wettability for forming uniform coat membranes<br>
could not achieve acceptable glossiness, and produced dull<br>
images due to bleeding of surfactants after bleeding of<br>
surfactants had been accelerated, though produced favorable<br>
glossiness immediately after printing.<br>
As to the ejection stability, it is considered that inks<br>
using the oligomeric fluorine surfactants of the present<br>
invention reduce the amount of foaming to reduce incorporation<br>
of air bubbles into heads, leading to stabilization of ejection.<br>
As described above, when an inkjet recording ink of the<br>
present invention is used for printing, it becomes possible to<br>
achieve excellent printed image quality even on a recording<br>
medium having poor ink fixability, prevent bleeding by<br>
polymerizing the fluorine surfactant through exposure to<br>
ultraviolet light, and maintain excellent adhesion or glossiness<br>
of the coated membrane.<br>
