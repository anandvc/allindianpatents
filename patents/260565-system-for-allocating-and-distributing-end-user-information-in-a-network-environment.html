				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of network communications and,<br>
more particularly, to a system and a method for allocating and distributing end user<br>
information in a network environment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Effective network communications is becoming increasingly important in<br>
today's society. One aspect of network communications relates to the ability to<br>
identify an end user associated with a communication flow. Devices, components,<br>
and equipment within a network may wish to glean information from the<br>
communication flow in order to provide some capability or enhancement within the<br>
network or to provision services for an end user based on his identity or his particular<br>
situation.<br>
In attempting to identify an end user associated with a communication flow,<br>
network designers generally insert a piece of network equipment somewhere in a<br>
communications l i n k such that the communication flow passes through the inserted<br>
piece of network equipment. This network configuration suffers from a number of<br>
drawbacks. For example, pieces of network equipment that are inserted into the<br>
communication pathway may slow overall network communications because the<br>
communication flow needs to be received and then retransmitted at each piece of<br>
equipment in the communication flow. In addition, some of the inserted network<br>
devices may wish to process the information within the communication flow before<br>
communicating the data to a next destination. Additionally, the processing of the<br>
information inay affect the communications format and/or present compatibility or<br>
encryption/decryption problems for devices and equipment positioned downstream of<br>
the processing devices. Accordingly, the ability to properly identify an end user in a<br>
network environment, without inhibiting system performance, presents a significant<br>
challenge to service providers, network operators, and component manufacturers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
From the foregoing, it may be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a<br>
need has arisen for an improved network communications approach that provides the<br>
capability for network devices or components to receive information associated with<br>
communication flows. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a system and a method tor distributing information in a network environment are<br>
provided that substantially eliminate or greatly reduce disadvantages and problems<br>
associated with conventional identification techniques.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method tor distributing information in a network environment that includes receiving<br>
one or more packets from a communication flow and recognizing a universal generic<br>
identification (UCH) associated with the communication flow. The UGI corresponds<br>
to an end user that is associated with the communication flow. The UGI is operable<br>
to enable a service for the end user in a first network and a second network, the first<br>
and second networks being different, whereby either the first network or the second<br>
network operates as a home network for the end user.<br>
Certain embodiments of the present invention may provide a number of<br>
technical advantages. For example, according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a network communications approach is provided that allows multiple<br>
devices or components within a network environment to receive information relating<br>
to a communication flow without burdening the overall communication system.<br>
Effective communications may be realized because of the UGI, which is used to<br>
correlate a profile to the end user. This further allows for a realization of flexible<br>
business models, whereby services can be delivered and billed without the need for a<br>
physical infrastructure. This can also enable a service provider to only provide a<br>
physical infrastructure and to support service delivery to all attached (or roaming)<br>
customers (i.e. a service provider does not necessarily have customers of his own).<br>
Yet another technical advantage relates to the ability to allow users to<br>
dynamically connect to any network via use of the UGI. This could further<br>
accommodate international roaming across any type of access network. Moreover,<br>
such a specification could allow any number of static business relationships to be<br>
achieved through predetermined definitions at a subscription time or, in the<br>
alternative, dynamic relationships may be triggered instantly between two networks.<br>
Static or dynamic on-demand business relationships can also be facilitated between<br>
enterprise IT departments, as well as service providers and mobile operators. This<br>
could extend to on-demand business access to enterprise IT applications (for example,<br>
as a visitor to a business partner network).<br>
The UGI also allows an existing billing infrastructure to be utilized without<br>
modification. For example, an existing domain name server (DNS) and an<br>
authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) infrastructure of individual<br>
networks can be used for billing because the respective AAA networks can<br>
communicate using existing protocols. Moreover, the ID server can be modified (and<br>
service information available to users and third party applications) via a policy<br>
template, which may be included in the ID server (or provided elsewhere in any<br>
appropriate location).<br>
Another technical advantage associated with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention relates to easier manageability for network architectures. This is achieved<br>
by having a single UGI in the communication flow that allows changes or<br>
modifications to the network to implicate only a single element instead of a series of<br>
devices or components in the communication flow. The integration of new<br>
components in the network is also made easier because only the UGI is affected by<br>
the change in a network configuration and/or the ID server. Also, formatting,<br>
encryption/decryption, and compatibility issues with new equipment being introduced<br>
in the communication flow will only implicate the UGI and/or the ID server instead of<br>
every piece of network equipment in the stream of the communication flow.<br>
S t i l l another technical advantage offered by one embodiment of the present<br>
invention relates to its flexibility. The use of the UGI provides a single point of entry<br>
for potential overrides to the end user identity/correlation function. This may operate<br>
to ensure that a proper end user profile is accurately matched with a given<br>
communication flow. Thus, the architecture provides better precision and improved<br>
fault tolerance than would otherwise be obtained by using several points or nodes in<br>
the network, which attempt to offer a portion of this functionality. Moreover, the<br>
flexibility of the UGI is further reflected by the ability to correlate an identity of an<br>
end user across disparate network access technologies. This is true because each<br>
network data source may be treated as an alternative data source and processed<br>
accordingly.<br>
Yet another technical advantage associated with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention relates to the failover capabilities within the network. The nonoperation<br>
of a single component seeking information relating to the communication<br>
flow w i l l not affect the overall operation of the network. This is true because the UGI<br>
and the ID server are generally the only elements involved in identifying the<br>
communication flow. The involvement of the UGI and the ID server is generally<br>
passive and, therefore, their non-operation does not influence system performance or<br>
i n h i b i t network operations. Certain embodiments of the present invention may enjoy<br>
some, all, or none of these advantages. Other technical advantages may be readily<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, description, and claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 is a simplified block diagram of a communication system 10 for<br>
allocating, distributing, and sharing identification information in a network<br>
environment in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Communication system 10 includes an end user 1 12a and an end user 2 12b, each of<br>
whom may be provided with (or assigned) a universal generic identifier (UGI)<br>
(illustrated by UGIs 14aand 14b respectively in FIGURE I). Communication system<br>
10 may also include multiple physical networks 16 (e.g. a cable network, an<br>
asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) network, a mobile network, a wireless<br>
local area network, etc.). Communication system 10 may also include a number of<br>
service provider domains 18 (e.g. a service provider 1, a service provider] (which is<br>
illustrated as the home network for end user 1), a mobile virtual network operator 1, a<br>
mobile virtual network operator 2 (which is illustrated as the home network for end<br>
user 2, etc.). Note that in this example, which is used for purposes of example and<br>
teaching only, a set of billing relationships 24 and 28 are present and implicate the<br>
two end users. Each of service provider domains 18 may include an identification<br>
(ID) server 30, which facilitates the reception and delivery of presence and service<br>
related information 20. In addition, all of the ID servers 30 may include a link to a<br>
generic routing service protocol (GRSP) element 34, which operates as a generic data<br>
transport.<br>
Communication system 10 may be generally configured or arranged to<br>
represent 2.5G communication architecture applicable to a global system for mobile<br>
(GSM) environment. Communication system 10 may also be configured to represent<br>
a first generation or a 3G UMTS architecture, a wire based network, a dial-up<br>
architecture, other appropriate mobile data networks associated with GPRS protocols,<br>
or any other suitable communicative platform, arrangement, or configuration in<br>
accordance with particular needs.<br>
According to the teachings of one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
communication system 10 allows users to attach to different service provider<br>
networks using UGIs 14a and 14b, GRSP element 34, and an ID server 30. A given<br>
end user can register for (or be assigned) a UGI on his home network ID server.<br>
Some of the bits in the UGI can identify specific information about the user such as a<br>
user's home network, for example. When used, the UGI can reflect a portable logical<br>
representation of the presence of the user and, further, allow a dynamic authorization<br>
of a user for connecting to any number of networks. This includes the ability to<br>
access enterprise networks. The use of the UGI also provides the ability to track and<br>
to b i l l for user activity outside the home network. The UGI can be presented by the<br>
user equipment upon attachment to any network and enable roaming over multiple<br>
disparate networks (e.g. over a cable network, an ADSL network, a mobile operator<br>
network, etc.). The UGI can be resolved in any appropriate fashion (e.g. through<br>
existing domain name server (DNS) and authentication, authorization and accounting<br>
(AAA) mechanisms, or in a new manner that uses a proprietary protocol) to provide a<br>
pointer (i.e. an index) back to the needed user information at user's home network.<br>
The UGI also enables presence, billing, and application activity information to be sent<br>
to the home network. Communication system 10 can also utilize user information<br>
(e.g. presence, access capabilities including parental controls, security keys, quality of<br>
service (QoS) capabilities and authorization, etc.) to use network resources and to<br>
access content. Such content can be disseminated to requestors in external networks,<br>
which authorize and bill a user (or an application) for the purpose of delivering<br>
services. Information such as presence, AAA, location information, and user<br>
preferences can be used to facilitate contact between individuals (potentially in<br>
disparate networks) and also between applications and individuals (again, potentially<br>
in disparate networks). This, in turn, enhances application value and increases the<br>
efficiency of service delivery. Such operations may also reduce the cost to provision<br>
new services because new services can be provided outside the home network.<br>
Note that for purposes of teaching and discussion, it is useful to provide some<br>
background overview as to the way in which the tendered invention operates. The<br>
following foundational information describes one problem that may be solved by the<br>
present invention. This background information may be viewed as a basis from which<br>
the present invention may be properly explained. Such information is offered<br>
earnestly for purposes of explanation only and, accordingly, should not be construed<br>
in any way to limit the broad scope of the present invention and its potential<br>
applications.<br>
The concept of international roaming between signaling system seven (SS7)<br>
based wireless networks of the same type (e.g. GSM or UMTS) is currently being<br>
deployed. This operation provides mobile subscriber voice services ubiquitously. In<br>
addition, the GPRS model is being leveraged using the same principle. Generic<br>
identification of an end user is generally achieved today in several systems (e.g. using<br>
an MS1SDN or the username with a NAI format). Such configurations can be used to<br>
roam across multiple networks such as GPRS and WLAN.<br>
In contrast to such architectures, communication system 10 adopts use of<br>
cooperating ID servers and a UGI, which provides for on demand access to services.<br>
Moreover, such operations may be presented or deployed between disparate networks.<br>
Thus, communication system 10 can provide: 1) service delivery and service mobility<br>
between disparate networks; and 2) a UGI with appropriate ID servers that provide ID<br>
management in a generic form across disparate networks. Communication system 10<br>
offers a method of attaching and accessing services (across similar and dissimilar<br>
networks), which can be achieved over IP-based networks that allow the end users to<br>
access any type services from the attached network or from the home network if so<br>
desired.<br>
The use of GRSP element 34 over IP (or any networking technology),<br>
facilitates the exchange of end user information between any two networks such that<br>
services are delivered ubiquitously for the end user. In addition, GRSP element 34<br>
and/or the UGI may be used to indicate the presence of the user on a network (e.g.,<br>
where the service was last delivered). This offers a powerful tool for interested<br>
network equipment, as outlined in greater detail below.<br>
Communication system 10 can assemble user information and allow explicit<br>
control of the distribution of this information to multiple third party applications, as<br>
well as users located outside the home network environment. The system can also<br>
provide for the transfer of semantic information (to allow service delivery) by using<br>
cooperating functions located in two or more networks. The system can also allow<br>
network and network services information to be bundled for individual users to<br>
provide numerous virtual views of network service capabilities. ID servers 30 may<br>
allow a history of presence activity: recognizing the last networks that were visited by<br>
a given end user using a weighting metric (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) instead of a binary<br>
presence indicator. Additional details relating to such a capability are provided below<br>
with reference to FIGURE 2.<br>
Note thai communication system 10 offers a network communications<br>
approach that allows multiple devices or components within a network environment<br>
to receive information relating to a communication flow without burdening the overall<br>
communication system. Effective communications may be realized because of the<br>
UGI that is used to successfully correlate a profile with the end user. This further<br>
allows for a realization of flexible business models, whereby services can be delivered<br>
and billed without the need for a physical infrastructure. This can also enable a<br>
service provider to only provide a physical infrastructure and to support service<br>
delivery to a l l attached (or roaming) customers (i.e. a service provider does not have<br>
customers of his own).<br>
Communication system 10 also accommodates international roaming across<br>
any type of access network. Moreover, such a specification could allow any number<br>
of static business relationships to be achieved through predetermined definitions at a<br>
subscription time or, in the alternative, dynamic relationships may be triggered<br>
instantly between two networks. Static or dynamic on-demand business relationships<br>
can also be facilitated between enterprise IT departments, as well as service providers<br>
and mobile operators. This could extend to on-demand business access to enterprise<br>
IT applications ( f o r example as a visitor to a business partner network).<br>
The UGI allows an existing billing infrastructure to be utilized without<br>
modification. For example, existing DNS and AAA infrastructure of individual<br>
networks can be used for billing because the respective AAA networks can<br>
communicate using the existing protocols. Moreover, ID server 30 can be modified<br>
(and service information available to users and third party applications) via a policy<br>
table or template.<br>
The proffered architecture also allows for an easier manageability for network<br>
architectures. This is achieved by having a single UGI in the communication flow<br>
that allows changes or modifications to the network to implicate only a single element<br>
instead of a series of devices or components in the communication flow. The<br>
integration of new components in the network is also made easier because only the<br>
UGI is affected by the change in network configuration. Also, formatting, encryption/<br>
decryption, and compatibility issues with new equipment being introduced in the<br>
communication flow will only implicate the UGI instead of every piece of network<br>
equipment in the stream of the communication flow.<br>
The present system also offers enhanced flexibility. The use of the UGI<br>
provides a single point of entry for potential overrides to the end user<br>
identity/correlation function. This may operate to ensure that a proper end user<br>
profile is matched with a given communication flow. Thus, the architecture provides<br>
better accuracy and improved fault tolerance than would otherwise be obtained by<br>
using several points or nodes in the network, which attempt to offer a portion of this<br>
functionality. Moreover, the flexibility of the UGI is further reflected by the ability to<br>
correlate an identity of an end user across disparate network access technologies.<br>
This is true because each network data source may be treated as an alternative data<br>
source and processed accordingly.<br>
The architecture of communication system 10 also provides failover<br>
capabilities within the network. The non-operation of a single component seeking<br>
information relating to the communication flow will not affect the overall operation of<br>
the network. This is true because the UGI and ID server 30 are generally the only<br>
elements involved in the communication flow. The involvement of the UGI and ID<br>
servers 30 is generally passive and, therefore, their non-operation does not impact<br>
system performance.<br>
Hnd users I2a and 12b are clients or customers seeking to initiate or to<br>
establish a communication tunnel, link, or session in communication system 10 via<br>
physical networks 16. End users 12a and 12b may be inclusive of devices used to<br>
initiate a communication, such as a computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a<br>
laptop or an electronic notebook, a telephone, a mobile station, or any other device,<br>
component, element, or object capable of initiating voice or data exchanges within<br>
communication system 10. End users 12a and 12b may also be inclusive of a suitable<br>
interlace to the human user, such as a microphone, a display, a keyboard, or other<br>
terminal equipment (such as for example an interface to a personal computer or to a<br>
facsimile machine in cases where the end user is used as a modem). End users 12a<br>
and I2b may also be any device that seeks to initiate a communication on behalf of<br>
another entity or element, such as a program, a database, or any other component,<br>
device, element, or object capable of initiating a voice or a data exchange within<br>
communication system 10. Data, as used herein in this document, refers to any type<br>
of numeric, voice, video, or script data, or any type of source or object code, or any<br>
other suitable information in any appropriate format that may be communicated from<br>
one point to another.<br>
In operation of a particular embodiment of the present invention, end user 12a<br>
or end user I2b initiates (or causes to be initiated) a communication flow within a<br>
network. A IJG1 accompanies the communication flow such that an identity of the<br>
end user is readily available to a receiving entity. An interested piece of network<br>
equipment may readily use the UGI to correlate the originating end user to a profile or<br>
policy (which may be retrieved from the end user's home network, provided in ID<br>
server 30, or located at any other appropriate site). Additional details relating to the<br>
information that is stored in each user's profile is provided below.<br>
Physical networks 16 each represent a series of points or nodes of<br>
interconnected communication paths for receiving and transmitting packets of<br>
information that propagate through communication system 10. Each of physical<br>
networks 16 may offer some service or capability to a given end user (or set of end<br>
users). In some cases, physical networks 16 simply offer connectivity for their clients<br>
or customers. Physical networks 16 may be coupled to one or more additional<br>
network elements (e.g. service provider networks). Physical networks 16 may offer a<br>
communications interface between a given end user and a requested network<br>
destination. Physical networks 16 may be any suitable architecture, such as a local<br>
area network (LAN), an enterprise network, a virtual private network (VPN), a<br>
metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN) or any other<br>
appropriate architecture or system that facilitates communications in a network<br>
environment. Physical networks 16 may implement a TCP/IP communications<br>
language architecture in a particular embodiment of the present invention. However,<br>
physical networks 16 may alternatively implement any other suitable communication<br>
protocol for transmitting and receiving information within communication system 10.<br>
Service provider domains 18 offer some application, feature, enhancement, or<br>
capability to a potential end user. As used herein in this document, the term "service"<br>
includes all of these elements. Such elements, for example, could relate to the ability<br>
to provide mobile communications to the end user. Other services may relate to<br>
connectivity, voice over IP, mobile wireless call features (call waiting, call<br>
forwarding, three-way calling, caller I.D., etc.), video phone, video streaming, video<br>
conferencing, internet access/browsing, intranet access, VPN systems, emailing, file<br>
transfer, M-commerce, location services (global positioning system (GPS)<br>
architectures, navigation, traffic conditions), and value added services (news, weather,<br>
sports, game, entertainment, music, etc.), for example.<br>
In operation, communication system 10 solves the problem of how to allow a<br>
mobile or a nomadic user to dynamically access all network services from any<br>
available access network. Communication system 10 also provides a scenario that<br>
allows other users to find and to communicate with a specific targeted end user.<br>
Mobile or nomadic users generally have access to a large number of networks and<br>
network access technologies. Communication system 10 allows an end user to just<br>
physically (wired or wirelessly) plug into any available access network and use their<br>
familiar services, access their enterprise applications, and to allow others to easily<br>
find and communicate with them. This ideal situation would enhance user<br>
productivity, increase convenience, and augment service provider revenue.<br>
GRSP element 34 allows multiple ID servers 30 to share information<br>
associated with one or more UGIs in a dynamic fashion. For example, an end user<br>
may have a subscription to a cable network, which may store the end user's identity in<br>
any appropriate format. For whatever reason, the end user may opt to fly to Germany<br>
to conduct some business. Once arriving in the new region, an end user can initiate<br>
contact with the cable network, which can then share this identity information with<br>
other providers. Consider FIGURE 1, where two end users are shown. These two<br>
users (when traveling) have a number of physical access networks available for their<br>
use. In this scenario, end user 1 has a b i l l i ng relationship 24 with service provider].<br>
This corresponds to end user 1 's home network. End user 2 has a billing relationship<br>
28 with mobile virtual network operator 2. This corresponds to end user 2's home<br>
network. Currently the two users are attached to physical networks not associated<br>
with their home network. End user 1 is attached to the cable network and end user 2<br>
is attached to a wireless mobile operator network.<br>
These physical access networks can be owned by service providers that do not<br>
represent the home networks for end user 1 or end user 2 (nor do these networks have<br>
a b i l l i n g relationship with either user in this example). The attachment process for<br>
both users is as follows: 1) attach the individual communications device to the<br>
physical access network; 2) device or individual presents the UGI to the network on<br>
which they are roaming; 3) if attaching to home network then the process moves<br>
directly to step 5; 4) if attached to another (non-home) network, then contact home<br>
network using GRSP element 34 for the needed information (uniquely identified by<br>
the UGI); 5) the home network does authentication and authorization of the user; 6) if<br>
permission is denied then a reject message is sent (potentially with cause) and the end<br>
user is not allowed attachment; 7) if permission is granted then the billing system is<br>
notified (e.g. via a AAA server) and presence information (and other information) is<br>
updated in the end user's home network ID server; and 8) the attachment is complete<br>
and service requests and b i l l i n g records flow therefrom. This achieves the ubiquitous<br>
connectivity for the end user.<br>
Once a user has successfully attached to the network (home or roaming<br>
network), the UGI can be used to retrieve and update information about the current<br>
user location, services accessed or allowed, presence of the user, etc. in his home<br>
network ID server. Service delivery can be accomplished through the following steps.<br>
(In the following example, assume a video chat is initiated by someone who wants to<br>
contact either end user 1 or end user 2.) The service delivery steps are as follows: 1) a<br>
video chat is initiated and sent to the (roaming) target individual; 2) an individual that<br>
initiated the video chat triggers a request for the UGI of the target individual. (Note<br>
that some DNS activity may be involved to find the UGI information and to get the<br>
home network of the target individual.); 3) this operation becomes a query to the<br>
target individuals" home ID server (and possibly to his network presence component<br>
to get the latest information); 4) if the individual is active in his home network or<br>
active in a roaming network, then the video chat starts; and 5) if the individual is not<br>
active in any network then a service denied message (with optional cause) is sent to<br>
the individual who initiated the video chat.<br>
FIGURE 2 is a simplified block diagram illustrating additional details relating<br>
to information stored within ID server 30. In a particular embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a table 50 is provided (in each of ID servers 30) that includes a service<br>
information segment 56 and a relationships segment 54. Relationships segment 54<br>
includes a number of illustrated networks. Information segment 56 includes a<br>
presence indicator, an active status demarcation, an authorization or an authentication<br>
parameter, an accounting segment, a current IP address element, and a security codes<br>
object. Such categories are arbitrary and can readily be replaced with other elements<br>
where appropriate and based on particular networking needs. The items of FIGURE 2<br>
offer only one of a myriad of potential objects that may be included in table 50 (or<br>
within ID server 30 in some other format).<br>
FIGURE 2 reflects an example of the user information maintained at each<br>
home network for a particular use. This information can be replicated for all users at<br>
their home network. Hence, FIGURE 2 shows an example of the kinds of information<br>
that can be kept at ID server 30. This information could be a listing (as shown) of<br>
networks the user is allowed to attach to, for example, because of a subscription or a<br>
service arrangement between service providers. Enterprise networks could be part of<br>
the allowed access networks. The list of networks can be static or be allowed to<br>
change dynamically. For example, such a change could occur after a credit<br>
transaction, whereby another network could be added to the list of available networks<br>
or an end user could be authorized as a visitor to a business partner network. In<br>
addition presence information and historical information can be maintained about user<br>
activity (e.g. in the context of problem determination operations).<br>
Thus, the UGI has the ability to recall or to remember where the end user has<br>
previously been (i.e. which network has been previously visited). For example, it<br>
could be recorded that end user John James visited a cable network, then a wireless<br>
network, and then a WLAN. In addition, the UGI can store the last network that was<br>
visited. Now, if someone wanted to reach John James (e.g. a financial business in the<br>
context of executing a trade for example), the UGI can identify where John James<br>
operated last. Thus, there exists a strong probability that John James is still there in<br>
that network location. In addition, the UGI can be used to derive a statistical<br>
relevance associated with the likelihood of finding the end user in a given network<br>
(e.g. based on the frequency associated with where the end user visits). Hence, ID<br>
server 30 can be leveraged to direct traffic in the network based on a statistical<br>
analysis. This correlates to the presence indicators of FIGURE 2. The presence value<br>
corresponds to a weight metric, which can be correlated to the frequency of usage of<br>
the networks by the end user.<br>
Note that the elements provided in ID server 30 are offered as potential<br>
examples and, thus, should not be construed to limit or to constrain the teachings of<br>
the present invention. Additionally, ID server 30 may be provided external to the<br>
service provider network where appropriate or combined with any other piece of<br>
network equipment in accordance with particular needs.<br>
In one embodiment, table 50 is a data storage unit provided in software that<br>
tracks, maintains, or identifies a given end user, as well as types of information that<br>
the end user may seek to obtain. In addition, table 50 may be configured such that it<br>
shares information with network vendors or other equipment within the network.<br>
Table 50 may also be used in order to build information or an in-memory data store<br>
and hold it persistently and potentially as long as the end user is active in<br>
communication system 10.<br>
Hence, ID server 30 may include table 50 (transient or otherwise) for storing<br>
any appropriate end user information. For example, table 50 may include information<br>
associated with the service provider offering service to the end user, network<br>
characteristics such as information related to packet data serving node (PDSN)<br>
characteristics, or any other suitable user profile characteristic or parameter that may<br>
be relevant to the communication flow.<br>
The information stored in table 50 may also include the IP address associated<br>
with the end user, the access devices used by given users, or any other suitable<br>
information or parameters in accordance with particular needs. Table 50 stores one or<br>
more end user profiles associated with clients or customers in the network. The<br>
profiles may also be provided in a given UGI. Thus, all of the information provided<br>
in table 50 may also be provided in respective UGIs and vice versa. Hence, a certain<br>
amount of redundancy may exist between ID server 30, UGIs 14a and 14b, and table<br>
50. The end user profiles may contain any appropriate parameters or characteristics<br>
of the end user (or of the network) that may affect treatment of communications links,<br>
tunnels, or sessions.<br>
fach profile may also include data reflecting bandwidth allocation parameters<br>
and/or information relating to QoS characteristics designated for the end user. ID<br>
server 30 may also provide a point of management to a service provider (or any other<br>
entity) in order to control one or more operations associated with the end user such as<br>
quality of service, access, privileges, or network enhancements.<br>
Table 50 may he populated in a variety of ways. For example, when the end<br>
user connects 10 the network, a RADIUS request is made on its behalf by a network<br>
access server (NAS) or any other appropriate device. In a mobile networking scenario<br>
this request, generally referred to as an Access-Request, may contain the user-ID in<br>
the User-Name attribute or in the calling station-ID attribute, which uniquely<br>
identities which end user is requesting the information from the network. If the AAA<br>
server authenticates and authorizes the end user successfully, a RADIUS Access-<br>
Accept message may be communicated back to the RADIUS client with an IP address<br>
in the framed-lP address attribute. The IP address may be the address used by the end<br>
user when it sends IP packets to an internet gateway. Entries within table 50 may be<br>
cleaned up, deleted, or updated periodically (or alternatively updated or changed<br>
based on some event or modification to system parameters) in order to accurately<br>
reflect one or more source profiles associated with one or more end users. Other<br>
parameters to be stored in the end user profile may include data relating to the<br>
network access technology being implemented by the end user and its associated<br>
characteristics, preferences relating to the network communications, or the physical or<br>
geographic location of the end user.<br>
Note that because certain enhancements should be made to several network<br>
components to achieve the targeted signaling of the present invention, it is critical to<br>
explain their internal structures. In a particular embodiment of the present invention,<br>
ID server 30. UGIs 14a and 14b, and/or GRSP element 34 include software that is<br>
operable to facilitate appropriate signaling for purposes of identifying an end user in<br>
the context of network connectivity, access, services, or applications. The<br>
augmentation or enhancement may be provided in just one of these elements, two<br>
elements, or in ail three elements. Such design choices may be based on particular<br>
networking or configuration needs. Alternatively, this identification capability may<br>
be provided by any suitable hardware, component, device, ASIC, field-programmable<br>
gate array (FPGA), micro-processor, read only memory (ROM) element, random<br>
access memory (RAM) element, erasable programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically<br>
erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), processor, algorithm, element or object<br>
that is operable to perform such operations. Note that such a signaling functionality<br>
may be provided external to the identified components (e.g. external to the service<br>
providers), allowing appropriate identification to be achieved for interested<br>
components in the network. Note also that the term "ID server" is not confined to<br>
simply a "server" architecture, as ID server 30 may include (or be replaced with) any<br>
of the items identified above.<br>
FIGURE 3 is a simplified schematic diagram that shows an example process<br>
60 for creating and modifying ID server 30 and/or a policy table. The policy table<br>
may be provided within ID server 30 or provided in some other appropriate location,<br>
such as on its own separate policy server. In other embodiments, the policy table<br>
and/or its information may be provided in ID server 30 or included in a given UGI.<br>
F1GURH 3 reflects a process showing the UGI and the services information<br>
aggregation and distribution flow: further reflecting the internal relationships between<br>
the UGI and the policy table.<br>
In block 62, a UGI pointed user information table component is provided. The<br>
table, which may be provided in ID server 30, may include a number of end users.<br>
The table may be used to distribute the identity information to the service providers.<br>
Hence, an index may be utilized by the UGI such that a given UGI can access the<br>
table and find an entry. A process for the distribution of information is invoked by<br>
block 68. Block 70 reflects the notion that new customers and subscribers may enroll<br>
in a financial plan or service contract in order to participate in such a network<br>
arrangement.<br>
Block 70 may also correlate to the collection of moneys and the registration<br>
for its members. Block 64 correlates to an ability to build the table and to manage<br>
processes associated with the table. Thus, a person actually inputs an entry (for the<br>
end user) into the user information table. Block 64 may interact with block 62 such<br>
that updated end user information is reflected in the user information table, whereby<br>
block 68 may be invoked to suitably process this information. When a subscriber<br>
attempts to access a service, a policy table (which, for example, may include a<br>
security rule or a parameter) may be invoked. This is reflected by block 72. This<br>
overall process may be executed in a systematic fashion in order to achieve<br>
connectivity for the end user, as well as to provide dynamic and ubiquitous network<br>
capabilities for participating end users.<br>
Some of the steps illustrated in FIGURE 3 may be changed or deleted, where<br>
appropriate, and additional steps may also be added to the flowchart. These changes<br>
may be based on specific system architectures or particular communication<br>
arrangements or configurations and do not depart from the teachings of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to<br>
particular embodiments, it should be understood that various other changes,<br>
substitutions, and alterations may be made hereto without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention. For example, although the present invention has<br>
been described as operating in particular environments, the present invention may be<br>
used in any networking environment that seeks to glean information from a<br>
communication flow. Communication system 10 may be used in conjunction with<br>
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), frame relay, X.25, or any other type of packet or<br>
circuit-switched network.<br>
It is also important to note that the teachings of the present invention may be<br>
readily imparted to an end user (or to a group of end users) such that the end user may<br>
sign up for (or enlist or enroll in) a charging plan that includes the operations and<br>
functions described herein. Thus, an end user could be enrolled in a charging plan<br>
that utili/es service tagging in order to achieve appropriate charging in a network<br>
environment. A corresponding bill may subsequently be generated that reflects such<br>
an arrangement. Such an arrangement may be reflected by a simple customer<br>
arrangement between a service provider and a client. In a similar fashion, an end user<br>
could be enrolled in a security policy plan, whereby similar subscribing occurs and<br>
billing ensues. The present invention is replete with such financial arrangements and<br>
readily encompasses all such possibilities.<br>
Additionally, although the present invention has been described with reference<br>
to communications between the end user and an AAA server, the UGI mechanism as<br>
described herein may be implemented for communications between any two<br>
components within a network. The present invention has merely described an<br>
example network environment for teaching purposes. This should not be construed to<br>
limit how or where the UGI mechanism is implemented. It should be clear from the<br>
foregoing that the UGI mechanism may be used outside the field of an AAA<br>
configuration.<br>
In addition, although ID server 30 has been illustrated as a separate element, it<br>
may be included in an AAA server or in any other element or component within<br>
communication system 10. ID server 30 has been illustrated in FIGURE 1 in a<br>
designated position for purposes of teaching, but ID server 30 may be positioned<br>
anywhere in the network and included in any additional network equipment or device<br>
where appropriate ID server 30 may also be used in legacy system architectures<br>
where appropriate.<br>
Numerous other changes, substitutions, variations, alterations, and<br>
modifications may be ascertained to one skilled in the art and it is intended that the<br>
present invention encompass all such changes, substitutions, variations, alterations,<br>
and modifications as tailing within the scope of the appended claims. In order to<br>
assist the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and, additionally, any<br>
readers of any patent issued on this application in interpreting the claims appended<br>
hereto, Applicant wishes to note that the Applicant: (a) does not intend any of the<br>
appended claims to invoke paragraph six (6) of 35 U.S.C. section 112 as it exists on<br>
the date of the filing hereof unless the words "means for" or "step for" are specifically<br>
used in the particular claims; and (b) does not intend, by any statement in the<br>
specification, to limit this invention in any way that is not otherwise reflected in the<br>
