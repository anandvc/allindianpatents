TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to substituted sulphone and sulphonamide compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to the use of the compounds for the prophylaxis and treatmait of medical conditions relating to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and/or disorders of the csitral nervous systHn (CNS), to achieve reduction of body weight and of body weight gain, as well as for cosmetic use.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above accepted norms. Obesity is the itiost important nutritional disorder in the western world and rqDreseots a major health problem in all industrialized countries. This disorder leads to increased mortality due to increased incidences of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. Searching for compounds, which reduce body weight has been going on for many decades. One line of research has been activation of serotoninergic systeoK, either by direct activation of serotonin receptor subtypes or by inhibiting serotonin reuptake. The exact receptor subtype profile required is however not known.<br><br>
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptaaiine or 5-HT), a key transmitter of the periptoal and central nervous sjtem, modulates a wide range of physio local and pathologica] functions, including anxiety, sle legilation, aggression, feeding and depression. Multiple serotonin receptor subtypes have h&amp;ea identified and cloned. One of these, the S-HTg receptor, was<br>
cloned by several groups in 1993 CRuat, M. et al. (1993) Biochran. Biophys. Res. Commun.193:268-276; Sebbea,M. et aL (1994) NeuroRort 5:2553-2557). This receptor is positively coi&gt;led to adenyljd cyclase and displays affinity for antidepressante such as clozapine. Recently, the effect of 5-HT6 antagonist and S-HTg antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported (Bentley, J.C. et al. (1999) Br J Pharmac. Siqjpl. 126, P66; Bentley, J.C. et al. (1997) J. Psychophaimacoi. Suppl. A64,255; WoolleyM.L. et al (2001)Neurophaimacology).<br>
Compounds with enhanced affinity and selectivity tor the 5-HTg receptor have been<br>
idenfiSed, e.g. in WO 00/34242 and by Isaac, M. et al. (2000) 6-Bicyclopiperazinyl-l-arylsulfonylindoles and 6-Bicyclopipendinyl-I-arylsulfonylindoles derivatives as novel, potent and selective 5-HTs receptor antagonists. Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 10: 1719-1721 (2000).<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTS<br>
The abiKty of a compound according to the invention to bind a 5-HTg receptor, and to be<br>
pharmaceutically useful, can be determined using in vivo and in vitro assays known in the art.<br>
(a) 5-HTe binding Assay<br>
Binding affinity experiment for the 5-HTg receptor are performed in HEK293 cells transfected with 5-HTg receptor using (3H)-LSD as labeled ligand according to the general method as described by Boess F.G et aL Neuropharmacology vol 36(4/5) 713-720, 1997.<br>
Materials<br>
Cell culture<br>
The HEK-293 cell line transfected with the 5-HTg receptor was cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium containing 5 % dialyzed foetal bovine serum, (Gibco BRL 10106-169), 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate and 400 ug/ml Geneticin (G-418) (Gibco BRL10131-019). The cells were passaged 1:10, twice a week.<br>
Chemkaia<br>
The radiofigand \^H\ LSD 60-240 Ci/mmol, obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, (Buciingfiarnsfcrire, England) was in ethanol and stored at -20°C. The unlabelled ligands, represemng different selectivity profiles, are presented in Table 1. The compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted with binding buffo.<br>
Disposable<br>
Compounds were diluted in Costar 96 well V-bottom polypropylene plates (Coming Inc. Costa, NY, USA). Samples were incubated in Packard Optiplate (Packard Instruments B. V., Gnmingen, The Netherlands). The total amount of added radioligand was measured in Packard 24-well Barex plates (Packard Instruments B.V., Groningen, The Netherlands)<br><br>
in the presence of Microscint™ 20 scintillation fluid (Packard Bioscience, Meridea, CT, USA).<br>
Buffer<br>
The binding buffer consisted of 20 mMHEPES, 150 mM Nad, lOmMMgCi^and 1 mM,<br>
EDTA,pH7.4.<br>
Methods<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells were grown to approximately W)% confluence on 24.5 x 24.5 NUNC culture dishes. The medium was aspirated, and after rinsing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were scraped off using 25 ml Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and a window scraper. The cells were then broken with a Polytron homogemser, and remaining particulate matter was removed by low-speed centrifugation, 1 OOOx g for 5 min. Finally, the membranes were collected by high-speed centrifugation (20 OOOx g), suspended in binding buffer, and frozen in aliquots at -70QC.<br>
Radioligand binding<br>
Frozen cell membranes were thawed, immediately rehomogenized with a Polytron<br>
homogenizer, and coupled to SPA wheat germ agglutinin beads (Amersbam Life Sciences,<br>
Cardiff, England) for 30 min under continuous shaking of the tubes. After coupling, the<br>
beads were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 g, and subsequently suspended in 20 ml of<br>
binding buffer per 96-well plate The binding reaction was then initiated by adding<br>
radioligand and test compounds to the bead-membrane suspension. Following incubation<br>
at room temperature, the assay plates were subjected to scintillation counting.<br>
The original SPA method was followed except for that membranes were prepared from<br>
HHK293 ceUs expressing (he human 5-HTg receptor instead of from HeLa cells (Dinh<br>
DM, Zaworski PG, Gill GS, Schlachter SE, Lawson CF, Smith MW. Validation of human 5-HT6 receptors expressed in HeLa cell membranes: saturation binding studies, pharmacological profiles of standard CNS agents and SPA development The Upjohn Company Technical Report 7295-95-064 1995^7 December). The specific binding of<br><br>
[ n]LSD was saturable, while the noo-specific binding increased linearly with the concentration of added radioligand. CS\ LSD bound with high, affinity to 5-HTg<br>
receptors. The K<j value was estimated to nm based on four separate experiments.></j>
The total binding at 3 nM of [^ LSD, the radioligand concentration used in the competition experiments, was typically 6000 dpm, aed the specific binding more than 70%. 5-HT caused a concentration dependent inhibition of f3!!] LSD binding with an over all average Ki value of 236 nM when tested against two different membrane preparations. The inter assay variability over three e^eriments showed a CV of 10% with an average K, values of 173 nM (SD 30) and a HH1 coefficient of 0.94 (SD 0.09). The intra assay variation was 3% (n=4). Ki values for a limited set of reference compounds wim reported binding affinities at 5-HTg receptor are presented in Table 7. AH unlabelled ligands displaced the specific binding of [^ LSD in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit at different potencies. The rank order of potency for the compounds was methiofhepin (2 nM) &gt;mianserm (190 nM) =5-HT (236 nM) &gt;methysergide (482 nM) &gt;mesulsrgide (1970 nM).<br>
Protein determination<br>
Protein concentrations were determined with BioRad Protein Assay (Bradford MM. A rapid and sensitive method for me quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding. Anal Biochem 1976;72:248-54). Bovine serum albumin was used as standard.<br>
Scintillation counting<br>
The radioactivity was determined in a Packard TopCount™ scintillation counter (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT, USA) at a counting efficiency of ar^xirnately 20 %. The counting efficiency was determined in separate sets of experiments.<br>
Saturation experiments<br>
At least 6 concentrations in duplicates of radioligand (0.1-20 nM of j^H] LSD) were used in saturation experiments. The specific binding was calculated as the difference between total binding and non-specific binding, which was determined as the binding of radioligand<br><br><br>
Antagonists to the 5-HTg receptor were characterized by measuring inhibition of 5-HT induced increase in cAMP in HEK 293 cells expressing the human 5-HTg receptor (see Boess et al. (1997) Neuropharmacology 36:713-720). Briefly, HEK293/5-HT6 cells were<br>
seeded in polylysine coated 96-well plates at a density of 25,000 / well and grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) (without phenol-red) containing 5% dialyzed Foetal Bovine Senrm for 48 h at 37°C in a 5% COj incubator. The medium was then aspirated and replaced by 0.1 ml assay medium (Hanks Balance Salt Solution containing 20 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM isobutyhnemylxanrhine and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After addition of test substances, 50 ^ dissolved in assay medium, the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The medium was again aspirated and the cAMP content was determined using a radioactive cAMP tit (Amersham Pharmacia<br><br>
Biotech, BIOTRAK RPA559). The potency of antagonists was quantified by detennining the concentration that caused 50% inhibition of 5-HT (at [5-HTJ= 8 times ECso) evoked increase in cAMP, using the formula ICso&gt;Mn=ICW(l-K5HTyEC5o).<br>
The compounds in accordance with the invention have a selective affinity to 5-HTg receptors with Kj and ICso^on values between 0.5 nM and 5 uM or display a % inhibition of fS\ LSD £ 20 % at 50 nM and are antagonists, agonist or partial agonist at 5-HTg. The compounds show good selectivity over 5-HTu, 5-BTa,, 5-HT2E, 5-HTa, 5-HTa;.<br>

Obese (ob/obj mouse is selected as the primary animal model for screening as this mutant mouse consumes high amounts of food resulting in a high signal to noise ratio. To further substantiate and compare efficacy data, the effect of the compounds on food consumption is also studied in wild type (C57BL/6J) mice. The amount of food consumed during 15 hours of infusion of compounds is recorded.<br>
Male mice (obese CSTBL/oTBom-Lep* *°&amp; lean wild-type C57Bl/6JBom; Bomholtsgaard, Denmark) 8-9 weeks witn an average body weight of 50 g (obese) and 25 g (lean) are used in all the studies. The animals are housed singly in cages at 23±leC, 40-60 % humidity and have free access to water and standard laboratory chow. The 12/12-h light/dark cycle is set to lights off at 5 pjn. The animals are conditioned for at least one week before start of study.<br>
The test compounds are dissolved in sotvents suitable for each specific compound such as cyclodextrin, cyclodextrin/methane sulfonic acid, polyemylene glycol/methane sulfonic<br><br>
acid, saline. Fresh solutions are made for each study. Doses of 30, 50 and 100 mg kg^day'1 are used. The purity of the test compounds is of analytical grade.<br>
The animals are weighed at the start of the study and randomized based on body weight Alzet osmotic minjpumps (Model 200 ID; infusion rate S ^I/h) are used and loaded essentially as recommended by the Alzet technical information manual (Alza Scientific Products, 1997; Theeuwes, F. and Yam, S.L Ann. Biomed. Eng. 4(4). 343-353,1976). Continuous subcutaneous infusion with 24 hours duration is used. The ininipiimps are either filled with different concentrations of test compounds dissolved in vehicle or with only vehicle solution and maintained in vehicle pre-wanned to 37°C (approx. lb). The rmhipumps are implanted subcutaneously in the neck/back region under short acting anesthesia (metofane/enfmrane). This surgical procedure lasts approximately 5 mm. It takes about 3 hto reach steady state delivery of the compound.<br>
The weight of the food pellets are measured at 5 p.m. and at 8 p. m. for two days before (baseline) and one day after the implantation of the osmotic minipunrps. The weigh-in is performed with a computer assisted Mettler Toledo PR 5002 balance. Occasional spillage is corrected for. At the end of the study the animals are killed by neck dislocation and trunk blood sampled for later analysis of plasma drug concentrations.<br>
The plasma sample proteins are precipitated with methanol, centrifuged and the supernatant is transferred to HPLC vials and injected into the liquid chromatography /mass spectrometric system. The mass spectrometer is set for electrospray positive ion mode and Multiple Reaction Monitoring. A linear regression analysis of the standards forced flrrough the origin is used to calculate the concentrations of the unknown samples.<br>
Food consumption for 15 hours is measured for the three consecutive days and the percentage of basal level values is derived for each animal from the day before and after treatment The values are expressed as mean ± SD and ± SEM from eight anirnalg per dose group. Statistical evaluation is performed by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA using the percent basal values. If statistical significance is reached at the level of p

To a solution of the aminonaphthatene derivatives (1 equiv,) in CH2CI2 (8 rnL/mmol) was added pyridine (3 equiv.) followed by the corresponding sulfonyl chloride (1.2 equiv.). The mixtures were stirred at ambient temperature overnight, washed with HC1 (1M) (2 mL) and dried (MgS04). The volatiles were eliminated under vacuo and gave the crude product which were purified by flash chromatography (SiC&gt;2, EtOAc:iso-hexane 1:4) to give desired sulfonamide.<br>
General method F Deprotection of boc-gronp<br>
The sulfonamide derivatives (prepared by Genera] Method Q were dissolved in a small amount of MeOH and treated with an excess of HC1 in diethyl ether (1M&gt;. Stirring at ambient temperature overnight resulted in a precipitate which were collected by filtration giving the title compounds as its hydrochloride salts.<br>
General method G<br>
3-Hydroxypyrrolidine (lequiv.) was dissolved in MeOH (lmL/mmol) and cooled on ice-bath. (BOC)30 (1.lequiv.) was added and me mixture was stirred for 2 h at ambient temperature. Pyridine/water (10/lOmL) was added and the mixture was stirred overnight. Evaporation of solvents and co-evaporation with toluene provided the desired boc-protected 3-hydroxypyrrolidine.<br><br><br><br>
