THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
NATURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
MEMORY ROLL OVER TESTING METHOD AND DEVICE FOR LOAD SURVEY DATA IN ELECTRONIC TRIVECTOR METER<br>
A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to a testing method of energy meter and more particularly relates to an accelerated testing method for the memory roll over for load survey data in electronic tri-vector meter.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
0002] An electric meter or energy meter is a device that measures the amount of electrical energy supplied to a residence or business. The most common type is more properly known as a (kilo) watt-hour meter or a joule meter. The most common unit of measurement on the electricity meter is the kilowatt-hour which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one kilowatt over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. The demand is normally measured in watts, but averaged over a period, most often a quarter or half an hour.<br>
[0003] The meters for measuring single phase energy are also available. It also provides capabilities like Maximum demand with date &amp; time, a kWh Backups, etc. The modem electricity meters operate continuously by measuring the instantaneous voltage (volts) and current (amperes) levels and computing the product of these to give an instantaneous electrical power (watts) which is then integrated against time to<br>
 <br>
give the energy consumed (in joules, kilowatt-hours etc). The meters fall into two basic categories, namely, the electromechanical meters and the electronic meters.<br>
[0004] The most common type of electricity meter is the electromechanical induction meter. The electromechanical induction meter operates by counting the revolutions of an aluminum disc which is made to rotate at a speed proportional to the power. The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy used. It consumes a small amount of power, typically around 2 watts.<br>
[0005] The metallic disc is acted upon by two coils. One coil is connected in such a way that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current. This produces eddy currents in the disc and the effect is such that a force is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current and voltage. A permanent magnet exerts an opposing force proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc so that the rotation of the disc is stopped, when power is not supplied. As a result, the disc is rotated at a speed proportional to the power being used. The type of meter described above is used on a single-phase AC supply. Different phase configurations use additional voltage and current coils.<br>
[0006] Some of the electricity meters are solid state type and they display the power used on an LCD module, while the electronic meters can be read automatically. In addition to measuring the consumption of the electricity, the solid state meters may also record other parameters of the load and supply such as maximum demand, power factor and reactive power used etc. They may also include the electronic clock<br>
 <br>
mechanisms to compute a value, rather than an amount, of electricity consumed, with the pricing varying of by the time of day, day of week, and seasonally.<br>
[0007] The Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) and Remote Meter Reading (RMR) describe various systems that allow meters to be checked by without the need to send a meter reading personnel out. This may be effectively achieved using the off-site metering technology. The electronic meter is placed at the junction point where all the connections originate, inaccessible to the end-user, and it relays the readings via the AMR technology to the utility.<br>
[0008] The testing of the electronic meters have always generated a problem. A special mode of register operation known as the test mode is available in the industry to perform the testing operation. However no effort has been made to improve the overall meter testing operation. The electronic meters have the potential of providing the faster testing times, multiple metering functions and calibration of the meter through software adjustment process. However the implementation of such functions may be expensive and complicated.<br>
[0009] It is necessary that the watt- hour meters are to be tested and serviced periodically to ensure the reliability and the accuracy of the energy meter.<br>
[0010] The Load survey data is one of the basic features of Electronic Trivector Meter (ETVM). The load survey data contains various energy values such as voltage and current values that are integrated for a predefined interval of time and are stored periodically. The predefined interval of time is called an Integration period. For example the integration period may generally be equal to 30min or 15min. The<br>
 <br>
periodically calculated load survey data is available for predefined number of days such as for example 30 days or 60 days. Some times the data may be stored in a memory for even 100 days. Since the memory block allotted in an ETVM is fixed, the memory will undergo rollover which means oldest data will be overwritten with new data, when the memory block is filled. If this rollover does not happen as intended, it may overwrite or corrupt other valuable data. So there is a need to verify the rollover process in the memory.<br>
[0011] Since the method of ETVM Firmware testing is a Black-box testing, the verification of a Load survey rollover will take 30 days for an ETVM containing 30 days load survey data. The testing time will vary depends on the availability of load survey data. Because of the high testing time, this testing is generally avoided.<br>
[0012] The currently available load survey data roll over verification method involves allowing the meter to run for the entire load survey days. The verification process could not be executed for the newly produced meters in a manufacturing facility because of the non availability of time.<br>
[0013] Hence there is a need to perform the verification of the roll over of load survey data in the memory of the electronic trivector meter easily, quickly and efficiently.<br>
 <br>
C)	OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] The primary object of the invention is to provide a testing method to verify the roll over the load survey data in the electronic trivector meter easily, quickly and efficiently.<br>
[0015] The other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

[0017] The various embodiments of the invention provide a method and device for verifying the roll over of the load survey data in an electronic trivector meter quickly and easily. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the real time clock (RTC) of the electronic trivector meter (ETVM) is forced to pause at the end of each integration period for a preset time interval so that the ETVM will observe the cross over of the integration period and write the load survey data for the elapsed integration period in the memory during the preset pause time. When one integration<br>
 <br>
period is crossed, the RTC of the ETVM is forced again to read and write the load survey data in the preset pause time and the process is continued until the load survey data for a predefined number of days are written into the memory. The forcing of the RTC is automated using an application software.<br>
[0018] According to another embodiment of the present invention, a device is provided to verify the roll over of load survey data in the memory of an electronic trivector meter (ETVM), A personal computer is connected to the ETVM including a memory to store the load survey data and a real time clock (RTC). An application software is executed in the personal computer to force the RTC to pass for a preset interval of time at the end of each predetermined integration period which is set for integrating the voltage and the current intervals.
