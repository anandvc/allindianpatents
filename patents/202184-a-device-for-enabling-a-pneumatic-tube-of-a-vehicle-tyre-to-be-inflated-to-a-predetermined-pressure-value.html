This invention relates to a device for enabling a pneumatic tube of a vehicle tyre to be inflated, quickly and easily, to a predetermined pressure value. The expression "pneumatic tube" in this specification includes other pneumatic articles, which are intended to be inflated to predetermined pressure valves, and to which the device proposed herein is applicable . e.g. inflatable wading pools for children, inflatable floats in the form of beds for swimmers to lie upon, inflatable top and sporting articles and so on.<br>
The device proposed herein can be manufactured to suit the correct tyre pressure values for different vehicles, such that during inflation of tube of a tyre of a specific vehicle, the pressure is built up only to the predetermined value and not above it or below it. According to one version of the said device, the pressure will be pre-set to the predetermined value at the factory itself and once so pre-set, the device is sealed so that it cannot be re~set by the user.<br>
According to another version, the said device can be pre-set to a desired value by the user. In this case, the device is not sealed, but enables the user to pre¬set  it to a desired pressure value. This is useful  in<br><br>
cases where the user may not strictly follow the tyre manufacturer's recommended pressure value, for various reasons -<br>
Another advantage of this invention is that air leaks from the tube valve of the tyre are virtually eliminated because the device acts as a further check against such leaks.<br>
The device herein also contributes to lower fuel consumption and less wear and tear on tyres by reason of correct tyre pressure being maintained.<br>
At automotive air inflation stations, considerable time<br>
is  saved,  since it will no longer  be  necessary  for<br>
vehicles to be parked near the inflator for long periods  for  inflating  the tube  of  each  wheel  and<br>
manually  adjusting  the pressure in the  tube  to  the<br>
desired value.<br>
Once inflated, the pneumatic tube tends to retain the pressure inside it for longer periods.<br>
Other benefits of this invention will be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br><br>
The device, according to this invention, for enabling a pneumatic tube of a vehicle tyre to be inflated, quickly and easily, to a predetermined pressure value, comprises a housing having first and second mouths, the first mouth being attachable to the air inlet of the valve of the said tube and the second mouth being attachable to the air outlet of an air inflator; a spring-loaded member reciprocably mounted within a main passage in the housing and normally closing the said passage under spring force, the first end of the said member, however, being actuated by the pin at the said air outlet to cause the member to move linearly and actuate the pin at the said air inlet, to open the said valve and permit air from the said inflator to pass through the main passage and inflate the said tube; a by-pass passage communicating with the main passage and with at least one outlet orifice provided on the housing, said by-pass passage being provided with a spring-loaded one way pressure release outlet valve, normally closing the by-pass passage, under spring fo?-ce; means for pre-setting the spring force acting on said outlet valve to a value equal to the predetermined pressure value, such that whenever the inflation air pressure  in the main passage exceeds the<br><br>
pre-set pressure value, the said outlet valve is actuated, by the air pressure within the by-pass passage, to open the by-pass passage and thus permit the air within the main passage and the by-pass passage to be bled through the outlet orifice to atmosphere, with an audible noise, thereby preventing further inflation of the tube.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of the device proposed herein, wherein<br>
Fig.l  illustrates  the said  embodiment  in  sectional<br>
elevation<br>
Fig.2 illustrates an end view<br>
and<br>
Fig.3 illustrates the said embodiment externally.<br>
A housing H has first and second mouths Ml and M2 the mouth Ml being attachable to the air inlet A of the valve of the pneumatic tube and the second mouth M2 being attachable to the air outlet of an air inflator.<br>
A  spring-loaded  member D (spring indicated by  E)  is<br><br>
reciprocably  disposed  within a main  passage P in  the housinc),  the  first  end F of  the  said  member  being actuated  by the pin of the outlet of the air  inflator to cause the said member to travel along the  direction of the arrow 1 and thus cause the second  end J of  the said  member  to  actuate the pin K of  the   said  air inlet  A, to open the said valve and  permit  air  from the said inflator to pass through the main passage P and inflate the said tube.<br>
A by-pass passage L communicates with the main passage P and with  outlet orifices N on the housing, said  by¬pass  passage  being provided with a spring-loaded  one way  pressure release outlet valve Q (spring  indicated by  R) having means  for pre-setting the force  of  the spring  R  to  a  value  equal  to  the   predetermined pressure  value,  such  that  whenever  the   inflation pressure in the main passage exceeds the pre-set value, the  outlet valve Q  is actuated, by the  air  pressure within the by-pass passage L, causing the air within  the main passage and the by-passage to be bled through  the outlet  orifices  to  atmosphere,  thereby  preventing further  inflation  of  the  tube.  Whenever  the   air inflator  is  removed  the  member  D  reverts  in  the<br><br>
direction  of  the arrow 2 to its normal  position  (as illustrated ) closing the main passage P.<br>
According to one of the forms of the means for pre¬setting the force of the spring R of the outlet valve a movable base member S is provided within the housing. The base member can be raised or lowered within the housing, such as, by way of threaded engagement between the exterior of the base member and the interior of the housing, to compress or decompress the spring R to the extent necessary for adjusting the force of the spring R to the pre~set pressure value-<br>
According to one of its forms the base member S is immovably sealed after the force of the spring is pre¬set as aforesaid.<br>
Alternatively, according to another form, the base member is not sealed, but continues to remain movably disposed within the housing to enable the user to alter the setting when required. This form of the device is not recommended, since wrong settings can result in damage to the tube and ultimately to the tyre itself.<br>
The  base V of the device is provided with  a  flexible<br><br>
cover W which covers the outlet orifices N such that whenever air escapes through the said orifices, the movement of air to atmosphere beneath the cover makes an audible noise indicating that the pressure has reached the predetermined value. Y is a dust cap provided for closing the mouth M2.<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention<br><br><br>
