				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
derivative having 2,6-disubstituted styryl and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof. The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a novel nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivative having<br>
2,6-disubstituted styryl and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and more<br>
particularly, to a pharmaceutical composition having an analgesic action especially<br>
on neuropathic pain which acts as a sodium channel inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A voltage-dependent sodium channel is a protein responsible for the<br>
initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. The voltage-dependent<br>
sodium channel is composed of one larger a subunit with four domains, each<br>
consisting of six transmembrane segments, as a common structure and two smaller P<br>
subunits. A maIor part of the channel function is played by a subunit. To date, more<br>
than 10 different a subunit subtypes have been known(Goldin AL, Annals of the<br>
New York Academy of Sciences 868:38-50, 1999). Each voltage-dependent sodium<br>
channel subtype shows distinct distributions in the central and peripheral nerve<br>
tissues. These subtypes regulate neural excitability and play an important role in<br>
regulating physiological functions in individual tissues. It is also suggested that they<br>
are deeply associated with various pathological conditions (Goldin AL, Annual<br>
Review of Physiology 63:871-894, 2001).<br>
In recent years, it has become clear that voltage-dependent sodium channels<br>
are deeply involved in neural transmission of pain, and sodium channel blockers are<br>
expected to be excellent pain therapeutics, especially neuropathic pain therapeutics<br>
(Taylor CP, Current Pharmaceutical Design 2: 375-388, 1996).<br>
Neuropathic pain means a pain that results from dysfunction in the central or<br>
peripheral neurons and refers to diabetic neuropathic pain, cancer pain, trigeminal<br>
neuralgia, phantom limb, post herpetic neuralgia, thalamic pain, etc. The clinical<br>
picture of neuropathic pain includes stabbing pain, burning pain, hyperalgesia,<br><br>
allodynia, etc.<br>
In medical scenes, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotic<br>
analgesics such as morphine, etc. are used for the purpose of relieving pain. Recently,<br>
antiarrhythmic drugs and anticonvulsants, which are sodium channel blockers, have<br>
come to be used as well, for the purpose of relieving pain.<br>
The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not completely satisfied in<br>
terms of analgesic actions and involve the problem of side effects such as<br>
gastrointestinal disturbance or renal disorder. The narcotic analgesics such as<br>
morphine are effective for nociceptive pain, but encounter serious side effects on the<br>
alimentary, respiratory or central nervous system. In addition, these drugs are<br>
generally less effective for neuropathic pain.<br>
The antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine or mexiletine and the<br>
anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, which are sodium channel blockers, have<br>
come to be used to relieve pain. Mexiletine has been approved and is available as an<br>
anti-diabetic neuropathic pain drug. However, these sodium channel blockers involve<br>
problems that they have central side effects such as convulsions or drowsiness, or<br>
peripheral side effects such as bradycardia and hence, have difficulty to increase a<br>
dose to a sufficient level, resulting in failure to achieve satisfactory analgesic effects.<br>
As above, analgesics that are useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain<br>
and are excellent in safety have not been found yet. Accordingly, sodium channel<br>
blockers having an excellent analgesic action especially on neuropathic pain with<br>
minimized side effects have been desired.<br>
Lidocaine, mexiletine, carbamazepine, etc. mentioned above are reported<br>
but do not fall under nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivatives having styryl<br>
group.<br>
Derivatives having a 1-pyridylalkylpiperidine as a basic skeleton are<br>
disclosed and have a sodium channel inhibitory activity (Patent Literature 1). In this<br>
literature, compounds having 2-cyclohexylmethyloxy-6-fluorophenylethenyl on the<br>
piperidine ring as a substituent are disclosed.<br>
Also, compounds containing a mono-substituted phenylethenyl having a<br>
halogen or cyclohexylmethyloxy at the 2- or 3-position of a 1-aromatic heterocyclic<br>
group-alkylpiperidine ring as a substituent are described (Patent Literature 2).<br>
On the other hand, compounds, not as sodium inhibitors but as metabotropic<br>
glutamate receptor (mGluR) inhibitors and analgesics, which are one of therapeutics<br>
for various diseases, based on mGluR inhibitory effects are disclosed (Patent<br><br>
Literatures 3 - 4). Specifically, there are described 2-pyridine compounds having<br>
styryl group (Patent Literature 3), thiazole, oxazole, 1,2,4-thiadiazole,<br>
1,2,4-oxadiazole, lH-l,2,4-triazole, 2-oxo-l,3,4-oxathiazole, 2H-tetrazole,<br>
2-pyridine, pyridinium, pirazine, indolinium, benzothiophene, benzothiazonium,<br>
quinoline or quinolium compounds having styryl group (Patent Literature 4),<br>
imidazole compounds having styryl group (Patent Literature 5), and imidazole,<br>
1.2,4-triazole or 2H-tetrazole compounds having styryl group (Patent Literature 6),<br>
but these compounds are unsaturated heterocyclic compounds having styryl group.<br>
Furthermore, piperidine compounds having benzyl or phenylmethylene<br>
based on NMDA/NR2B antagonizing effect are disclosed (Patent Literature 7).<br>
On the other hand, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivatives having<br>
styryl group, which are formed by combining groups, are disclosed (Patent<br>
Literatures 8 and 9) and among these derivatives, only the compounds that phenyl<br>
group and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring are combined via a -O-lower<br>
alkylene-(Patent Literature 3), a -S-lower alkylene- or a -lower alkylene-C(0)0- are<br>
specifically disclosed (Patent Literature 4) but nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
derivatives are neither disclosed specifically nor even suggested. Moreover, these<br>
derivatives are used as calcium channel antagonists (Patent Literature 8) or for<br>
promotion of acetylcholine release (Patent Literature 9) but nothing is disclosed or<br>
even suggested on any sodium channel inhibitory activity or any analgesic action.<br>

[Processes for Production]<br>
Compound (I) of the present invention can be produced by applying a<br>
variety of synthesis techniques, using the characteristics based on its basic skeleton<br>
or type of substituents. Hereinafter, representative processes are described below.<br>
PROCESS 1:<br><br>
(wherein A, R1 - R13 and n have the same significance as defined above; hereinafter<br>
the same).<br>
Compound (la) of the present invention can be obtained by the Wittig<br>
reaction (Org. React., 14, 270-490 (1965)) of a phosphonium salt (II) with an<br><br>
aldehyde or ketone (III) in a conventional manner. A reaction solvent, which can be<br>
used, includes a solvent inert to this reaction, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, toluene, etc. As a base, there may be used<br>
sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium ethoxide, lithium diisopropylamide,<br>
etc. The reaction can be carried out under the conditions of cooling (e.g., -70°C) to<br>
heating.<br>
PROCESS 2:<br><br>
Compound (lb) of the present invention can be obtained by the aldol<br>
condensation (Org. React., 16,1-438 (1968)) of an aldehyde (TV) with a (V) in a<br>
conventional manner. A reaction solvent, which can be used, includes a solvent inert<br>
to this reaction, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, toluene, etc. The reaction may be carried out under basic<br>
conditions and in this case, sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium<br>
ethoxide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, etc. may be<br>
used. As an acid used when the reaction is carried out under acidic conditions, there<br>
may be used hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tosylic acid, boron trifluoride,<br>
aluminum trichloride, titanium tetrachloride, etc. The reaction can be carried out<br>
under the conditions of cooling (e.g., -70°C)to heating.<br><br>
(wherein M represents Li, MgCl, etc.; hereinafter the same).<br>
Compound (Ic) of the present invention can be obtained by the reaction of<br>
an aryl metal such as an aryl lithium, an aryl Grignard, etc. with a carbonyl<br><br>
compound in a conventional manner (Org. Synth. HI, 200 (1955); Org. React., 6,<br>
339-366 (1964); Org. React., 8, 258-304 (1967)). A reaction solvent, which can be<br>
used, includes a solvent inert to this reaction, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide, toluene, etc. The reaction can be carried out under the<br>
conditions of cooling (e.g., -70°C) to heating.<br>
In addition to the processes described above, Compound (I) of the present<br>
invention can also be obtained, e.g., by the Peterson reaction (Org. React., 38, 1-223<br>
(1990)), formation of triple bond followed by partial reduction (I. Am. Chem. Soc,<br>
77, 3378 (1955); I. Am. Chem. Soc, 99, 2805 (1977); Synthesis, 1973, 457;<br>
Tetrahedron 30, 3817 (1974)), etc.<br><br>
(wherein R9a means R9 other than H and X1 means a leaving group such as a halogen,<br>
rnethanesulfonyloxy, p-toluenesulfonyloxy, etc.; hereinafter the same.)<br>
This process is alkylation. Specifically, the alkylation is carried out as in the<br>
processes described above, e.g., in a solvent inert to the reaction, using an amine (Id)<br>
and a compound (VIII) having a leaving group corresponding to the reaction in a<br>
chemically equivalent amount or in an excess of either reactant, under the conditions<br>
of cooling to heating. In some occasions, the reaction is carried out smoothly in the<br>
presence of a base (e.g., an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium<br>
carbonate, cesium carbonate, etc.; an organic base such as triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, etc.; a metal alkoxides such as potassium tert-butoxide,<br>
sodium tert-butoxide, etc.; sodium hydride; lithium hydride; etc.), an additive<br>
(tetra-n-butylammonium iodide, potassium iodide, sodium iodide, etc.), which is<br>
advantageous.<br>
A reaction solvent, which can be used, includes a solvent inert to this<br>
reaction, such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, acetonitrile,<br><br><br>
(wherein R9b-CO- represents an optionally substituted an acyl; and X2 represents OH;<br>
a leaving group such as a halogen, 1-hydroxybenzotriazol-l-yloxy, methoxy,<br>
phenoxy, azido, etc., or a leaving site in a mixed anhydride or a symmetric<br>
anhydride; hereinafter the same.)<br>
This process is amidation. Specifically, the amidation is carried out as in the<br>
processes described above, e.g., by reacting an amine (Id) with a carboxylic acid or<br>
its reactive derivative (IX) in a chemically equivalent amount in accordance with the<br>
processes described in, e.g., M. Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry" (1988, pages 55-73),<br>
Nobuo Izumiya, et. al, "Basis and Experimentals of Peptide Synthesis" (1985, pages<br>
89-142), etc.<br>
Specifically, this reaction is preferably carried out by the method using a<br>
condensing agent conventionally used (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,<br>
l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, 1,l'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI),<br>
etc.); the mixed anhydride method using ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl<br>
chloroformate; the symmetric anhydride method using ethoxyacetylene, an<br>
alkynylamine such as tert-butylethynyldimethylamine, etc. If desired, a catalyst such<br>
as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, etc. may be used. The reaction may also be carried out by<br>
reacting a carboxylic acid with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride, oxalyl<br>
chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, etc. to convert the acid into a reactive derivative<br>
such as an acid halide and then reacting the reactive derivative with a primary or<br>
secondary amine. The reaction is carried out in a solvent inert to this reaction such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, toluene, etc., if necessary, in the presence of a base (e.g., an<br>
organic base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, etc.; an<br>
inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, etc.), under<br>
the conditions of ice cooling to heating with stirring.<br><br><br>
(wherein R9Crepresents a group having a carbon number less than by one from the<br>
optionally substituted lower alkyl shown by R9, hereinafter the same).<br>
This process is reductive amination.<br>
Specifically, the reaction is carried out as in the processes described above,<br>
e.g., by reacting an amine (Id) with an aldehyde or ketone (X) in a conventional<br>
manner of reductive amination, e.g., the process described in "Experimental<br>
Chemistry Series (Maruzen)" (4th edition, 20, 1992, page 300), edited by The<br>
Chemical Society of Iapan, etc.<br>
Specifically, Compound (Ig) can be produced by reacting the amine with its<br>
chemically equivalent amount of the aldehyde or ketone in a solvent inert to this<br>
reaction such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dichloromethane, dichloroethane,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, toluene, etc., in the presence of a reducing<br>
agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium<br>
borohydride, formic acid, etc., under the conditions of ice cooling to heating with<br>
stirring. In some occasions, the reaction is carried out smoothly in the presence of an<br>
acid (e.g., a Lewis acid such as titanium tetraisopropoxide, etc.; acetic acid;<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid, etc.), which is advantageous. The reduction described above<br>
may also be performed in the above-described solvent inert to the reaction by<br>
catalytic reduction in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium (Pd),<br>
platinum (Pt), etc.<br>
The reducing agent may be added immediately after mixing the primary or<br>
secondary amine with the aldehyde or ketone or after passage of some time.<br>
The foregoing shows the processes for producing representative compounds.<br>
In addition, compounds other than the compounds of the present invention or raw<br>
compounds but having similar substituents can be subIected to reactions for<br>
modifying substituents according to the processes described above to produce the<br>
compounds of the present invention. In addition to the processes described above,<br><br>
these compounds can be produced by other well known processes, including<br>
conventional imidation or amidination, or by the processes described in<br>
"Experimental Chemistry Series (Maruzen)" (4th edition, 25, pages 396-427) edited<br>
by The Chemical Society of Iapan,<br>
Protective group Organic Synthesis, Second Ed., Iohn Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., or<br>
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998, 37, p2046-2067, etc.<br>
Compound (I) of the present invention thus produced is isolated in its free<br>
form or as its salt. The salt of Compound (I) of the present invention can be prepared<br>
by applying a conventional salt-making technique to Compound (I) of the present<br>
invention as the free base.<br>
Also, Compound (I) of the present invention or its salt may be isolated and<br>
purified in the form of a hydrate, solvate or polymorphism thereof. The isolation and<br>
purification are performed by applying conventional chemical operations including<br>
extraction, concentration, distillation, crystallization, filtration, recrystallization,<br>
various chromatography techniques, etc.<br>
Various isomers can be separated by choosing an appropriate raw compound,<br>
or by utilizing a difference between isomers in physical or chemical properties. For<br>
example, the optical isomers can be converted into stereochemically pure isomers, by<br>
choosing appropriate raw compounds or by racemic resolution of racemic<br>
compounds (for example, by a process of optical resolution which comprises<br>
converting the racemic compounds into diastereomer salts with ordinary optically<br>
active acids, etc.).<br>

composition or a liquid composition. Alternatively, the compound is intravenously<br>
administered to an adult at a dose of 1 mg to 500 mg per day in one portion or<br>
divided portions, or intravenously administered in a sustained release manner for a<br>
period of 1 hour to 24 hours per day. As described above, since the dose may vary<br>
depending upon various conditions and thus, a dose below the range given above<br>
may be sometimes sufficient.<br>
As the solid composition for oral administration in accordance with the<br>
present invention, tablets, powders, granules and the like are used. For such solid<br>
composition, one or more active substances are mixed with at least one inactive<br>
diluent, for example lactose, mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or metasilicate aluminate<br>

additives other than inactive diluents, for example, lubricants such as magnesium<br>
stearate, disintegrators such as cellulose calcium glycolate, stabilizers such as lactose,<br>
solubilization or dissolution-auxiliary agents such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid.<br>
The tablets or pills may be sugar-coated or coated with a gastric soluble or enteric<br>
film, using sucrose, gelatin, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose phthalate, and the like.<br>
The liquid composition for oral administration contains pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsifiers, solubilizers, suspending agents, syrups, elixirs and the like<br>

or ethyl alcohol. The composition may further contain auxiliary agents such as<br>
solubilization- or dissolution-auxiliary agents, moisturizers and suspending agents,<br>
sweeteners, flavoring agents, aromatic agents and preservatives.<br>
The inIections for parenteral administration include aseptic, aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous solubilizers, suspending agents and emulsifiers. Aqueous solubilizers<br>
and suspending agents include, for example, distilled water for inIections and<br>
physiological saline. Water-insoluble solubilizers and suspending agents include, for<br>
example, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil,<br>
alcohols such as ethanol, polysorbate 80 (trade name), etc. Such composition may<br>
further contain additives including isotonic agents, preservatives, moisturizers,<br><br>
emulsifiers, dispersants, stabilizers (for example, lactose), and solubilization- and<br>
dissolution-auxiliary agents. These are sterilized by filtration through, e.g., a bacteria<br>
retention filter, or by blending with sterilizers or irradiation. These may also be<br>
prepared into aseptic solid compositions and the resulting aseptic compositions are<br>
provided for use after dissolution in aseptic water or in an aseptic solvent for<br>
inIections, prior to use.<br>
Furthermore, Compound (I) of the present invention may be used in<br>
combination with therapeutics for the diseases described above or with other drugs<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The compounds of the present invention have the sodium channel inhibitory<br>
action and are useful as pharmaceuticals, especially therapeutics for diseases<br>
associated with sodium channel and symptoms accompanied by these diseases,<br>
preferably as analgesics for neuropathic pain.<br>
For example, neuropathic pain means a pain caused by dysfunction of the<br>
central or peripheral nervous system and includes diabetic neuropathic pain, etc.<br>
[Pharmacological Tests]<br>
Hereinafter, experiments on the sodium channel inhibitory action using<br>
representative compounds of the present invention and animal tests using mice and<br>
rats are described in detail.<br>
(Experiment on sodium channel inhibitory action)<br>
The sodium channel inhibitory action of representative compounds in<br>
Compound (I) of the present invention was confirmed by experiment of [14C]<br>
guanidine uptake using rat brain tissues. The [14C] guanidine uptake experiment was<br>
performed by the method of Bonisch et al.(British Iournal of Pharmacology 108,<br>
436-442, 1993) with some modifications. The [14C] guanidine was used as a sodium<br><br>
tracer, and the inhibitory activity on uptake of [ C] guanidine induced by veratridine<br>
as a sodium channel activator into rat cerebral cortex primary neurons was measured.<br>
a.	Preparation of rat cerebral cortex primary neuron culture system<br>
Pregnant rats (Wistar, female, 19 days of gestation) were anesthetized with<br>
ether. The animals were bled to death by giving incision through the carotid artery.<br>
The fetuses were taken out of the pregnant rats and after ethanol sterilization, the<br>
cerebral cortex was removed from the fetuses. The cerebral cortex was digested with<br>
papain and dispersed in culture medium, followed by plating on a<br>
poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well white plate at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells/well.<br>
Incubation was performed in a CO2 incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for 2 days.<br>
b.	Assessment of test compounds<br>
After each well was washed once with an assay buffer (135 mM choline CI,<br>
5 mM KC1, 1 mM MgS04, 5.5 mM glucose, 1 mg/mL BS A, 10 mM Hepes-Tris, pH<br>
7.4), a fresh assay buffer was added to the well, followed by incubation at 25°C for<br>
10 minutes. Then, a reaction solution (a test compound, [14C] guanidine and 100 |I.M<br>
veratridine) was replaced for the buffer, followed by incubation at 25°C for 15<br>
minutes. The reaction was terminated by washing 3 times with a cold wash buffer<br>
(135 mMNaCl, 5 mM KC1, 1 mMMgS04, 10 mM Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4). To each<br>
well, 17 \xL of O.lNNaOH was added. After agitation, 100 uL of scintillator was<br>
added to the well and further agitation was continued. The radioactivity was<br>
quantified by a liquid scintillation counter. In each experiment, the sodium<br>
channel-specific uptake of the whole uptake was designated as portion that was<br>
inhibited by 1 mM mexiletine. The action of the test compound on sodium channel is<br>
expressed as 50% inhibition concentration(ICso) based on the specific uptake.<br>
As shown in Table 31, the compounds of the present invention exhibited<br>
excellent inhibitory action.<br><br><br>
(Analgesic action on animal with streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy)<br>
Representative compounds of Compound (I) of the present invention were<br>
assessed for the analgesic action in mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic<br>
neuropathy to confirm the effect on neuropathic pain. The assessment was performed<br>
by the method of Kamei et al. (Pharmacology Biochemistry &amp; Behavior 39, 541-544,<br>
1991) with some modifications.<br>
Male ICR mice of 4 weeks old were intraperitoneally inIected with 200<br>
mg/kg weight of STZ to prepare mice with diabetic neuropathic pain. The analgesic<br>
action was assessed by the tail pinch test. Specifically, the analgesic action was<br>
detected as prolongation in withdrawal latency (in seconds), i.e., the time until the<br>
animal showed head-turning response after the tail was pinched with forceps. On<br>
Day 14 following the STZ inIection, a pretest was carried out to determine the<br>
response latency before the administration of a test compound. Only the animals<br>
showing not longer than 3 seconds of the response latency in the pretest were used<br>
for the test compound assessment on the following day (Day 15 after STZ inIection).<br>
In the test compound assessment, the response latency after the<br>
administration of a test compound was measured. The test compound was orally<br>
administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg, 45 minutes prior to the response latency<br>
measurement<br>
The analgesic action of a test compound is expressed as prolongation of<br><br>
latency (in seconds) calculated by the formula: (response latency after administration<br>
of a test compound) - (response latency before administration of a test compound).<br>
As shown in Table 32, the representative compounds of the present<br>
invention displayed the prolongation of latency (in seconds) of about 1 to 5 seconds.<br>
Separately, a test was conducted in a similar fashion, using a solvent (10% w/w<br>
DMSO/water) in place of the compound of the present invention. The results indicate<br>
that the prolongation of latency (in seconds) was 0.69 ± 0.38 second (mean +<br>
standard error).<br>
Generally in this analgesic test, the prolongation of at least about 1 second is<br>
considered to be effective and when the prolongation is longer than 1.5 second, the<br>
activity is rated as excellent; when the prolongation exceeds about 2 seconds, the<br>
analgesic action is rated as extremely excellent. Accordingly, the compounds tested<br>
in Examples have more excellent activities as compared to those of Comparative<br>
Examples 1 and 2. Mexiletine showed the prolongation of about 3 seconds.	.<br><br><br>
Comparative Example 1:<br>
Compound described in Example 308 (Patent Literature 1: EPC 1254904)<br>
Comparative Example 2:<br>
Compound described in Example 334 (Patent Literature 1: EPC 1254904)<br>
(Anti-allodynia effect in rats with L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation)<br>
One of the maIor symptoms in neuropathic pain is a markedly lowered<br>
threshold of response to tactile stimulation (allodynia). The anti-allodynia effect of<br>
the representative compounds in the compounds of the present invention was<br>
confirmed by assessing the analgesic action in L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation rats. The<br>
assessment was performed by the method of Kim and Chung (Pain 50, 355-363,<br><br>
1992) with some modifications.<br>
Under pentobarbital anesthesia, male SD rats of 5 or 6 weeks old were given<br>
surgery to ligate both the left L5 and L6 lumbar nerves tightly with silk threads. For<br>
the assessment of analgesic action, the von Frey hair test was adopted. That is, the<br>
animal's hindpaw was picked with hair and the lowest strength of hair for limb<br>
withdrawal response was designated as a response threshold (log gram) to<br>
mechanical stimulation. Since it was confirmed in prior test that the response<br>
threshold of the animal's hindpaw ipsilateral to the side of ligation was markedly low<br>
during days 7 to 14 after the surgery (in the state of allodynia), the anti-allodynia<br>
effect of a test compound was assessed on any day between days 7 and 14 from the<br>
surgery. On the day before the assessment of a test compound, the response threshold<br>
before administration of a test compound was measured. The animals were divided<br>
into 4 to 5 groups so that differences in the mean values of response thresholds<br>
before administration among the groups and variation within groups become small.<br>
In the assessment of a test compound, the response threshold after administration of<br>
the test compound was measured. The test compound was orally given 30 minutes<br>
before measurement of the response threshold. The anti-allodynia action potency of a<br>
test compound is expressed as ED50. In the calculation of the ED50, the thresholds of<br>
ipsilateral and contralateral paws in the solvent group were designated as 0% and<br>
] 00%, respectively.<br>
Compounds having excellent ED50 values were found in the compounds of<br>
the present invention, whereas mexiletine showed ED50 value of about 70 mg/kg.<br>
It was confirmed by the test described above that the representative<br>
compounds in the compounds of the present invention show the sodium channel<br>
inhibitory action. It was also confirmed that these compounds with oral<br>
administration exhibited the analgesic action, that was more excellent than that of<br>
heretofore known compounds, in the disease animal models, i.e., mice with diabetic<br>
neuropathy and L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation rats. Based on the foregoing results, it<br>
was confirmed that some compounds of Compound (I) of the present invention<br>
showed sodium channel inhibitory action that was more excellent than that of<br>
mexiletine. It was also confirmed that some compounds of Compound(I) of the<br>
present invention with oral administration showed analgesic action that was equal or<br>
superior to that of mexiletine in the animal disease model, i.e., mice with diabetic<br>
neuropathy.<br>
Based on the evidence mentioned above, it was confirmed that the<br><br>
compounds of the present invention are excellent sodium channel inhibitors and are<br>
useful for relief of pain, especially neuropathic pain such as pain accompanied by<br>
diabetic neuropathy, etc.	,<br>
