3D BULLET AND CARTRIDGE CASE ANALYSIS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a system and a method for the analysis and comparison of ballistic pieces of evidence suGh as fired bullets and spent cartridge cases. More specially, it relates to a computerized system and method for ballistic piece of evidence (BPOE) analysis based on a 3D imaging of the BPOE surface. .<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In the field of forensic science, investigations of crimes involving firearms use ballistic comparison test to determine if a bullet or a spent cartridge case found on the crime scene has been fired by a firearm in question. Ballistic comparison tests rely on the fact that when a bullet is fired by a firearm, striations are created on the bullet surface and these striations have enough unique features to represent a signature of the firearm. With regards to spent cartridge cases when a firearm is fired unique identifiable features (marks) are impressed or striated onto various areas of the cartridge ca,se. These unique marks are transferred from the firearm to the cartridge case each time the firearm is discharged; thesÂ£ marks also represent the signature of the firearm. Therefore by comparing the striations or impressed characteristics of two bullets or two cartridge cases, it is possible, to conclude if they have been fired by the same firearm.<br>
[0003] Most existing automatic ballistic comparison systems use 2D imaging techniques to obtain images of the striations or impressed marks on the ballistic piece of evidence (i.e. the bullet or the cartridge case) under test. They then compare these images to other images from a database of known firearms. The firearm that was used to fire the ballistic piece of evidence (BPOE) under test can be identified when a match is obtained between the images of the BPOE under test and the images of<br><br>
the database corresponding to a BPOE fired by the same firearm. [0004] However, ballistic matching techniques based on 2D-imaging present many drawbacks. In particular, it is found that the technique lack robustness: the images resulting from a 2D imaging are very dependent on the exact way the BPOE is illuminated and imaged as well as on the surface conditions of the BPOE, therefore affecting the performance of the technique.<br>
[0005] Recently, Bachrach et a/, in their US Patent No. 6,505,140 B1 have proposed to use a confocal technique, also referred to as a 3D-imaging technique, to better study and identify the features of a bullet surface. A confocal sensor enables one to measure the striation structure and this leads to a more reliable way than a 2D-imaging technique to characterize the striations on a bullet surface. However, the striation characteristics are resolved along particular direction of a bullet striation, to obtain what is called a depth profile of the bullet striation. Therefore, although a 3D-imaging technique is used, no real 3D buliet signature is established and used for further ballistic comparison.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method and an apparatus to obtain a surface mapping of a BPOE under examination that can be used thereafter as a 3D signature for identifying purposes during ballistic test comparison.<br>
[0007] More specifically, in an embodiment, the present invention provides a method of mapping a surface of a BPOE. The method comprises acquiring a plurality of regional reliefs, each regional relief corresponding to a region of the plurality of regions, and assembling the plurality of regional reliefs into a mosaic for obtaining a relief map of the surface to thereby obtain a mapping of the surface of the BPOE. [0008] Preferably, the present invention provides a method for acquiring the relief map of the surface of the BPOE by acquiring and<br><br>
assembling  a  mosaic  of overlapping   regional   reliefs.   The   method comprises selecting at least one region that is partly overlapping at least another region for thereby acquiring at least two overlapping reliefs, each having an overlapping area; and aligning the at least two overlapping reliefs such that the overlapping areas are substantially overlapping. [0009]    Advantageously, the overlapping area of an overlapping relief represents approximately 50 % of the surface of the overlapping relief, when the E3P0E that is under examination is a bullet. [0010]     Advantageously, the overlapping area of an overlapping relief represents approximately 50 % of the surface of the overlapping relief, when the BPOE that is under examination is a cartridge case. [0011]     Preferably,  a  confocal  sensor is  provided to  perform  the mapping of the surface of the BPOE.<br>
[0012] In another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides an apparatus for mapping a surface of a BPOE, The apparatus comprises a holder for holding the BPOE and a measurement unit for measuring a light intensity from the BPOE as a function of a measurement position, wherein the measurement position is a relative position between the BPOE and the measurement unit. The apparatus also comprises a displacement unit for providing a series of different measurement positions and a controller unit to control the displacement unit for mapping the surface of the BPOE.<br>
[0013] Preferably, the measurement unit comprises a" confocal sensor such as a confocai microscope.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0028] We will describe a system for mapping a surface of a BPOE 9. The system can be equally used to map a bullet 12 or to map a spent cartridge case 112.<br>
[0029] System for mapping a bullet surface; In a first embodiment of the present invention, a computerized system 10 equipped with a confocal microscope is used to obtain a surface mapping of a bullet. This embodiment is illustrated in FIG.1A and can be described as follow. The system 10 comprises as the main elements a bullet holder 11 to hold a bullet 12, a confocal microscope sensor 16 to acquire a relief map of a surface 17 of the bullet 12, and a displacement system controlled by a computer 22, to vary the relative position between the bullet 12 and the sensor 16. It is worth mentioning that although, in certain embodiments of the present invention, a confocal microscope is used as the mapping sensor, other sensors could also be used (Moire, Laser Confocal Scanning Microscopy, Pixel Contrast).<br>
[0030] In this first embodiment, the bullet holder can rotate the bullet 12 about the rotation axis 13 shown in F1G.1 A, via a motor 14. Using sensor 16, this-rotation movement of the bullet 12 permits the measurement of contiguous regions of the bullet 12 surface 17, to form later on a relief map of a peripheral band of the bullet 12. In this embodiment, a regional relief of a region of the bullet 12 is obtained, and then the builet 12 is rotated by an angle to present another surface region, that will include a 50% overlap with the previous region, to the field of view of the sensor 16, and so on, until a complete peripheral band is measured. The exact angle of rotation is calculated and is inversely.proportional to the bullet caliber. Obviously, other measurement configurations may also be implemented without departing from the scope of this invention.<br><br>
[0031] In this first embodiment, the rotation of the bullet 12 is controlled via the controller 24 which is itself linked to the computer 22. An encoder 27 measures the rotation angle of the bullet 12 and relays this information to the computer for further analysis.<br>
[0032] The relative position between the bullet 12 and the sensor 16 is changed by the micro-positioners 19 and 20. One micro-positioner 20 permits the variation of the height of the sensor 16 whereas the other micro-positioner 19 enables to vary the relative distance and tilt between the sensor 16 and the bullet 12. All micro-positioners 19, 20 are controlled by the computer 22 so that a series of measured intensities as a function of a series of distances may be obtained in a controlled manner, and that several such series may be obtained for several different regions of the bullet 12,<br>
[0033] â  In this first embodiment, the confocal microscope 16 comprises an analog to digital converter 21 which relays to the computer 22 the digitalized microscope measurements. The computer 22 is used to control and adjust the parameters of the sensor 16 such as for example the focal distance of the microscope, its field of view, etc. In this first embodiment, the computerized system 10 also comprises a display unit 28 to visualize the measurements and the experiments parameters, and is also linked to a database 29 in which the measurements will be stored. The database 29 also gives access to measurements of other bullets for ballistic comparison studies. An analysis program 37 is used for processing the experimental data of the bullet 12 under examination and a comparison program 38 is used to compare the present bullet 12 relief map to other relief maps found in the database 29. In a preferred embodiment, the methods of the present invention may be embodied in computer 22. [0034] System for mapping a cartridge case surface: In a second embodiment, a system 110 similar to system 10 just described, is used to obtain a surface mapping of a spent cartridge case 112. This second embodiment is  illustrated   in  FIG.1B. The main  differences  between<br><br>
FIG.1B and FIG.1A are related to the ways the cartridge case 112 is held and displaced by system 10 while acquiring the mosaic of relief regions. [0035] In this second embodiment, the cartridge case holder 111 can displace the cartridge case 112 about the X and Y axis shown in FIG.1B, via two motors 14. Using sensor 16, this displacement of the cartridge case 112 permits the measurement of contiguous regions of the cartridge case 112 surface 117, to form later on a relief map of a composite region of the cartridge case 112. In this second embodiment, a regional relief of a region of the cartridge case 112 is obtained, and then the cartridge case 112 is displaced first in the X direction and then in the Y direction to present another surface region, that will include a 50% overlap with the previous region, to the field of view of the sensor 16, and so on until a complete array of regional reliefs, forming, when assembled, an image of the full head of the cartridge case 112, is obtained. The exact displacement is constant. Obviously, other measurement configurations may also be implemented without departing from the scope of this invention.<br>
[0036]     In this second embodiment, the rest of the system 110 is the same as for the system 10, and therefore will not be further described. [0037]     A surface mapping method: We will now describe in detail a method 50 of mapping a surface of a BPOE 9. The method applies equally weli to a bullet 12 or to a cartridge case 112. [0038]    The main steps of a surface mapping method 50 of a BPOE according to an embodiment of the present invention are listed in FIG. 2A and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs. [0039]     A BPOE 9 under examination is provided at step 52 and a measurement unit adapted to acquire a relief map of a surface of the BPOE is provided at step 54. Then, at step 56, the measurement unit acquires the relief map to thereby map the surface of the BPOE 9. In one embodiment,   this   surface   is   a   peripheral   band   of   a   bullet   12 corresponding to a surface region of the bullet 12 expected to contain<br><br>
significant striations 23 produced when the firearm is fired. In another embodiment, this surface corresponds to a surface region of the cartridge case 112 expected to contain significant impressed marks 23 produced when the firearm is fired. Often, but not exclusively, this surface region is located using a 2D-imaging technique, this permits examination of the bullet 12 or the cartridge case 112 prior to the 3D-imaging measurement, in order to identify what surface region of the BPOE 9 contains the striations or impressed marks 23 that should be analyzed, with the present invention. In an embodiment, the previously described computerized systems 10 and 112 comprise the measurement unit used in step 54. Thus according to the method 50, a BPOE 9 under examination is installed in the bullet holder 11 of the computerized system 10 (when the BPOE is a bullet) or in the cartridge case holder 111 of the computerized system 110 (when the BPOE is a cartridge case). The interface program 37 embedded in the computer 22 is used to program the sensor 16 measurement parameters, and to control the sensor displacements via the micro-positioners 19, 20. When the BPOE 9 is a bullet 12, the computer 22 also controls the holder rotating motor 14. The computer thus sends a signal to the rotating motor 14 to rotate the bullet 12 until the surface, that has been chosen to be.mapped, is in the field of view of the sensor 16, and the encoder 27 sends back a signal to inform the computer of the value of the measurement angle. The computer 22 also sends signals to the micro-positioners 19, 20 to adjust the height of the sensor 16 relatively the bullet 12 via the micro-positioner 20, and a relative distance, d (not shown), between the bullet surface .and the sensor 16 via the micro-positioner 19. When the BPOE 9 is a cartridge case 112, the computer 22 controls the transversal displacement unit 113 that permits the displacement of the cartridge case head in the field of vjew of the sensor 16. The computer sends a signal to transversal displacement unit 113 to displace the cartridge case 112 until the surface, that has been chosen to be mapped, is in the field of view of the sensor<br><br>
16, and the encoder 27 sends back a signal to inform the computer of the value of the measurement angle. The computer 22 also sends signals to the micro-positioners 19, 20 to adjust the height of the sensor 16 relative to the cartridge case 112 via the micro-positioner 20, and a relative distance, d (not shown), between the cartridge case surface and the sensor 16 via the micro-positioner 19.<br>
[0040] Turning now to FIG. 2B, in a preferred embodiment of step 56\ a surface region of a BPOE 9 susceptible to contain significant impressions and/or striations 23 is mapped. When the BPOE 9 is a bullet 12, this surface region corresponds to a peripheral band of the bullet surface containing significant striations 23. When the BPOE 9 is a cartridge case 112, this surface corresponds to a full region of the cartridge case head surface containing significant impressions and/or striations. This mapping is performed by acquiring a mosaic of regional reliefs, each regional relief corresponding to a region among a plurality of regions (step 60), where the plurality of regions forms, in the case of a bullet, the peripheral band or forms, in the case of a cartridge case 112, the full region of the cartridge case head surface. Then, at step 67, this mosaic of regional reliefs is assembled for obtaining the relief map of the surface region of a BPOE 9 under examination. This assembling is performed, for example, with the analysis program 37 of the computer 22. [0041] Now referring to FIG. 3, a flow chart details the step of acquiring a mosaic of regional reliefs from FIG. 2B (step 60) when a confocal microscope is used as the measurement unit (step 541). First, at step 61, a region is selected among the plurality of regions that form the mosaic. Then, at step 70, the system 10 makes a series of measurements with the confocal microscope to obtain a series of light intensities ld(x,y), corresponding to the selected region as a function of the variable distance d, where d is the distance separating a reference surface of the BPOE 9 and the confocal microscope and where x and y are the surface coordinates of the selected region. This step 70 comprises several<br><br>
intermediate steps that are detailed in FIG. 4 and will be described herein below,<br>
[0042] When step 70 is completed for the selected region, the regional relief z(x,y) 80 corresponding to the selected region is determined in step 63 using the well-known analysis principles of the confocal method. The result of this analysis' is a regional relief map z(x,y) 80, where z is the depth value at the coordinates (x,y) of the selected region, and this result can be simply stored in the computer 22 for further analysis. [0043] Then, steps 61, 70, and 63 are repeated until the regional reliefs of all the regions of the plurality of regions have been determined, therefore obtaining a complete mosaic of regional reliefs (step 67). [0044] Turning now to FIG. 4, the intermediate steps that are comprised in step 70 of FIG. 3 are detailed. The goal is to measure with the confocal microscope the light intensity distribution, ld(x,y), for a series of different distances d, where x and y are the surface coordinates of the region under examination. A first distance is selected (step 71) via the computer 22, then the sensor 16 position is adjusted (step 73) accordingly via the micro-positioners 19. Then a first intensity distribution is acquired (step 75) with the sensor 16, digitized, and sent to the computer 22 for storage (step 77). These steps are repeated for all the distances of the series of distances, so that a complete series of light intensities is obtained (step 79).<br>
[0045] FIG. 6A is an example of a regional relief 80 of a bullet surface obtained with the surface mapping method just described, where an enlarged striation 23 can be seen. In this preferred embodiment, a regional relief corresponds to a physical area of 15mm X 1.5mm. The regional relief is mapped into an array of 512 x 512 pixels providing, in an exemplary embodiment, a lateral resolution of approximately 3 microns. Typical depth range of a regional relief depends on the bullet caliber, the firearm and the region. The biggest range would be found on a small caliber on the shoulder area and would be around 50 microns. The<br><br>
smallest range would be found on a .50 caliber in the middle of a groove engraved area and would be around 5 microns. The depth resolution of the sensor is, in an exemplary embodiment 10 nanometres. Obviously, other physical characteristics of the regional relief can be obtained without departing from the scope of this invention, by tuning the system 10 â  differently.<br>
[0046] FIG. 6B is a sectional view taken along cross-section-line A-A of FIG. 6A showing the striation structure 93 along this cross-section line. It can be seen on this figure that this cross-section line possesses profile characteristics and features that can be used as a firearm identification signature.<br>
[0047] FIG. 8A is another example, this time of a regional relief 180 of a cartridge case obtained with the surface mapping method just described, where an impression and/or striation 23 can be seen, A regional relief corresponds to a physical area of 1.5mm X 1.5mm. The regional relief is mapped into an array of 512 x 512 pixels providing a lateral resolution of approximately 3 microns. Typical depth range of a regional relief depends on the cartridge case caliber, the firearm and the region. The biggest range would be found on a large caliber on the firing ping impression area and would be around 250 microns.<br>
[0048] FIG. 8B is a sectional view taken along cross-section line AA of FIG. 8A showing the impression and/or striation structure 93, which can be used, as already mentioned, as a firearm identification signature. [0049] Turning now to FIG. 5, a preferred embodiment of the mapping method 50 comprises acquiring a mosaic of overlapping reliefs 56\ each overlapping relief corresponding to an overlapping region among a plurality of overlapping regions, wherein each overlapping relief has at least one overlapping area in common with an overlapping area of another overlapping relief (step 62). The advantage of acquiring overlapping reliefs (partly overlapping) is that they can be more easily aligned when comes the time to assemble them to form the final image of<br><br>
the BPOE. This assembling can be performed by finding the best overlapping degree between overlapping areas that are in common (step 64).<br>
[0050] It is worth mentioning that the relief maps may suffer of distortions due, for example, to the curved surface of the bullet. The present invention provides an algorithm correcting these distortions effects in order to eliminate such distortion in.the final assembling step. Aiso other distortion effects due to optical effects or due to misalignment measurement errors are also corrected via the algorithm provided by the present invention.<br>
[0051] FIG. 7 gives an example of a peripheral band 100 of a bullet 12 that was formed by a mosaic of aligned overlapping reliefs 88 where an exploded close-up of three consecutive overlapping reliefs of the mosaic is shown. As can be seen, each overlapping relief 88 has at least one overlapping area 89 in common with an overlapping area 89 of another overlapping relief. In this example, the overlapping areas 89 are chosen such that each of the overlapping regions of this mosaic overlaps its neighbor regions by about 50 %. Naturally other overlapping degree could also vary without departing from the scope of this invention. [0052] FIG. 9 gives an example of surface array 200 of a cartridge case 112 that was formed by a mosaic of aligned overlapping reliefs 88. As can be seen, each overlapping relief 88 has at least one overlapping area 89 in common with an overlapping area 89 of another overlapping relief, In this example for a cartridge case head, the overlapping areas 89 are chosen such that each of the overlapping regions of this mosaic overlaps with its neighbor regions by about 50 %. Naturally other overlapping degree could also be varying without departing from the scope of this invention.<br>
