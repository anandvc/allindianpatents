ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE TREATMENT METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for treatment and/or prevention of diseases associated with the presence of amyloid deposits, which include Alzheimer's disease.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
Certain facts are known about the biochemical and metabolic phenomena associated with the presence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Two structural and histopathological changes observed in the brains of those with AD are neurofibrillar tangles (NFT) and amyloid deposits. Intraneuronal neurofibrillar tangles are also present in other neurodegenerative diseases, but the presence of amyloid deposits both in the intraneuronal spaces (neuritic plaques) and close to the microvasculature (vascular plaques) seems to be characteristic of AD. Of these, neuritic plaques seem to be the most common (Price, D.L., and co-workers, Drug Development Research (1985) 5:59-68).<br>
The main component of these amyloid plaques is a peptide of 40-42 amino acids denominated amyloid peptide Ap4.<br>
The amyloid peptide Ap4 is a polypeptide that originates from proteolysis from membrane glycoproteins denominated amyloid peptide Ap4 precursor proteins (pAPP). These proteins, precursors of amyloid peptide, consist of 695 to 770 amino acids, all of them being coded by the same gene.<br>
Two main variants of amyloid peptide Ap4 have been identified, peptide Ap40 and Ap42, containing 40 and 42 amino acids, respectively, which present different tissue distributions in both physiological and pathological conditions. The variant of 42 amino acids is the predominant form in the amyloid plaques located in the brains of patients with AD.<br>
Until present, different possible solutions have been proposed to provide a possible vaccine against AD.<br><br>
In EP526511, the administration of homeopathic doses of Aβ to patients with pre-established AD is proposed. However, due to the doses used, the levels of circulating endogenous Aβ in plasma hardly vary, and so no therapeutic benefit is expected.<br>
Schenk et a!., (Nature, 1999; 400: 173-177) describe immunization of transgenic mice PDAPP with A|342, which overexpress human mutant APP, thus preventing the formation of amyloid plaques, neuritic dystrophy and astrogliosis.<br>
In W09927944 (Schenk D.), a treatment for AD is described by administration to a patient of Ap42.<br>
A phase III clinical trial in 360 patients diagnosed with medium to moderate AD in 4 European countries and the United States, in which amyloid peptide Ap42 was used as an antigen, was discontinued after encephalitis was reported in some of the patients (Scrip Daily Online, 25 Feb 2002, S007455320, The Scientist 16 [7]: 22, April 1, 2002).<br>
The problem of using an endogenous protein as a vaccine (or a protein present naturally in the animal that is being vaccinated), as is the case of peptide Ap42, the organism responds by making antibodies against Ap42 and against smaller fractions that may also have as yet unknown physiological functions, among some of the possible problems we could mention is the possible development of autoimmune diseases due to the generation of antibodies against the endogenous protein, difficulty in the generation of a immune response due to failure of the immune system for recognizing endogenous antigens, and possible development of an acute inflammatory response.<br>
The present invention is aimed at treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other amyloid diseases by administration of a peptide, of the C-terminus part of Ap, conjugated with a protein, which in a preferred embodiment of the present invention said protein is the keyhole limpet hemocyanin.<br>
EXPLANATION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to a vaccine for the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other related amyloid diseases.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a vaccine is provided for the prevention and/or treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other related diseases, which overcomes the disadvantages associated with using peptides, proteins or endogenous immunogens.<br>
Examples of other diseases characterized by amyloid deposits are Islandic hereditary syndrome, multiple myeloma, and spongiform encephalitis, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<br>
The introduction of an immune response can be active such as when an immunogen is administered to induce antibodies that react with Aβ in a patient, or passive, such as when an antibody is administered that reacts by itself with Aβ in a patient.<br>
For the aims of the present invention, the following terms are defined as follows:<br>
The term "related amyloid diseases" includes diseases associated with the accumulation of amyloid which can be restricted to one organ, localized amyloidosis, or spread throughout several organs, systemic amyloidosis. Secondary amyloidosis can be associated with chronic infections (such as, for example, tuberculosis) or chronic inflammation (for example, rheumatoid arthritis), familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and other types of systemic amyloidosis found in patients in the long-term treatment of hemodialysis. Localized forms of amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, type II diabetes and any other disease related thereto, neurodegenerative diseases with scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy.<br>
The term "passive immunization" is used to relate to the administration of antibodies or fragments thereof to an individual with the intention of conferring immunity on that individual.<br><br>
In the first aspect, the invention provides the use of either a peptide that acts as an immunogen or as an antibody, in the preparation of a medication for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits. Said methods consist of the induction of an immune response against a peptide component of the amyloid deposits in the patient. Said induction could be active through administration of an immunogen or passive through administration of an antibody or an active fragment or derivative of an antibody.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the disease is Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The medication obtained can be used both in asymptomatic patients such as those who show symptoms of the disease.<br>
In accordance with the presence of the present invention, the compositions able to provoke an immune response directed against certain components of the amyloid plaques are effective for treatment or prevention of diseases related to amyloid deposits. In particular, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, it is possible to prevent the progress of, reduce the symptoms of and/or reduce the deposition process of amyloid in an individual, when an immunostimulatory dose of a peptide or of an antibody obtained therefrom, is administered to the patient.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the antibodies are obtained by immunization of mammals or birds by use of a peptide conjugated to a protein as an immunogen.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mammals used for immunization can be ruminants, equines, lagomorphs, carnivores, primates, or any other animal that allows adequate quantities of serum to be extracted therefore for antibody. Among the birds used for immunization, we can mention, but in no way limit to, Galliformes, Anseriformes and Columbiformes, among others.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, this provides tne use of a peptide conjugated to a protein that acts as an immunogen to produce antibodies able to specifically recognize any of the predominant variants of the beta amyloid peptide Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the preparation of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the brain of a patient.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is illustrated by means of the following examples.<br><br>
Example 1. Generation of polyclonal antibodies.<br>
The four polyclonal antibodies against the four peptides conjugated with KLH that were used as immunogen were generated by imnnunization in New Zealand white rabbits.<br>
Each immunogen was injected into two rabbits, with five injections in each rabbit: the first intradermal injection of the peptide-KLH conjugate in PBS and emulsified in complete Freud adjuvant and four more intramuscular injections, as a booster dose on days 14, 28, 49 and 80, of the same peptide-KLH conjugate in PBS but this time emulsified in incomplete Freud adjuvant, with the blood letting done at 90 days to detect the presence of antibodies.<br>
After collecting blood, the serum was separated and pre-purified by desalination and then the antibodies were purified by affinity in a matrix comprising 1.5 ml of EMD-Epoxy activated material (Merck) to which 5 mg of the corresponding peptide was added. The purified fractions were packed in 0.1% BSA (Sigma) and stored at 4°C. and glycerol 20-50% could be added as a cryoprotector.<br>
Example 2. WESTERN-BLOT for Ap<br>
1. Electrophoresis<br>
The Laemmli method was used, described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1998, modified by improve the separation of small peptides.<br>
The apparatus used was a Miniprotean 3 from Bio-Rad.<br>
A 15% acrylamide gel was used, mixed with the following components:<br><br><br><br>
Initial stock solutions of peptide A(340 and 42 of 1 mg/ml were used (dissolved in PBS). The volume necessary was taken of these solutions for each one of the samples and made up to 20 μl with SBLT (SBL + Tris base 2 M). The samples were then boiled for 5 minutes to denature the peptides and eliminate possible proteases.<br>
The center of the cuvette was filled with cathode buffer and the outside with anode buffer, the composition of these buffers being as follows:<br>
Anode buffer<br>
24.2 g Tris base (0.2 M final concentration)<br>
Dilute to 1 litre with H2O<br>
Adjust of pH 8.9 with concentrated HCI<br>
Store at 4°C for up to 1 month<br>
Cathode buffer<br>
12.11 g Tris base (0.1 M final concentration)<br>
17.92 g tricine (0.1 M final concentration)<br>
1 g SDS (0.1% final concentration)<br>
Dilute to 1 litre with H2O<br>
Do not adjust pH<br>
Store at 4°C for up to 1 month<br>
Finally, the samples were loaded into the wells: 20 μ;/well. Using the Polypeptide Standard Kaleidoscope from Bio-Rad as a marker, migration started at low voltage (30 V), and then the voltage was raised to 100 V, after approximately 1 hour of electrophoresis.<br>
2.- MEMBRANE TRANSFER<br><br>
The proteins separated in the gel were transferred to the PVDF membrane by electroblotting. In the transfer booklets the following were placed<br>
Black side -sponge- 3 Whatmann papers (or filter papers) -gel- -membrane- -3 Whatmann papers- -sponge- -transparent side.<br>
The cuvette was then filled with electroblotting buffer:<br>
Glycine 38 nM Tris base 50 mM Methanol 40%<br>
The transfer was done for 2 hours at 200 mA. During the transfer, the buffer was kept stirring with the magnetic stirrer.<br>
3- INCUBATION WITH ANTIBODIES<br>
The antibodies and the powder milk were dissolved in PBS-t (PBS + 0.5% Tween 20), carrying out the washing with PBS-T also.<br>
After the transfer, the surface of the membrane was blocked with 5% solution of powder milk for 1 hour with stirring and at room temperature (RT)<br>
After this, the membrane was washed for 2 x 5 minutes at RT.<br>
Then, it was incubated with primary antibody (SAR-1, SAR-2, SAR-3 or SAR-4) for 1 hour at RT at least diluted 1:500 in PBS-T.<br>
The membrane was washed: 3x10 minutes at RT. Then, it was incubated with secondary antibody: goat anti-rabbit-HRP for 1 hour at RT (1:10,000 in all cases).<br>
The washing of the membrane was repeated once again: 3x10 minutes at RT.<br>
4.- DEVELOPMENT<br><br>
After the last washing, the membrane was incubated with the solution of the chemoluminescence kit, using the ECL kit+Plus from Pharmacia.<br>
The membrane was wrapped in cellophane and exposed to double-emulsion film (Hyperfilm MP from Amersham), for different times of between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.<br>
Example 3. Immunohistochemistry with SAR-1, SAR-2, SAR-3 and SAR-4 antibodies in the tissue of human brain.<br>
The sections of tissue were fixed in paraffin following the following steps:<br>
a)	fixation in neutral formol at 10%<br>
b)	dehydration by successive steps in increasing concentrations of alcohol<br>
c)	passes through xylol and paraffin, this latter step in an oven at 60-62°C.<br>
d)	carrying out of paraffin blocks, which were cut to 4 microns and mounted in slides.<br>
The sections were then deparaffinized by passing through the following solutions:<br>

1:100 in PBS/T for 45 minutes in darkness, keeping these conditions until<br>
development was complete m) Washing in PBS 3x5 minutes n) Development in diaminobenzidine (DAB)<br>
The time was controlled empirically under a stereoscopic microscope. For this, first, a washing was done in a solution of Tris-HCI 0.5 M for 10 minutes with shaking, to then continue with incubation with a diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB) diluted in Tris-HCI 0.05M and to which is added 0.5 ^il/ml of H2O2 at 4°C. Once the reaction was finished, three washes were done in PBS at 4°C for 5 minutes each time and then dehydration in ethanol was done at 70%, 90% and 100% for 2 minutes each time, passing through xylol for 4 minutes and a further pass through xylol for 2 minutes, until they were mounted with Eukitt for observation under the microscope.<br>
