				<td>Technical Field<br>
The invention relates generally to protection and<br>
automation control functions for power systems, and more<br>
particularly concerns a system for providing separation between<br>
the protection and automation functions in a single apparatus.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Power system substations typically include both protection<br>
and automation and control equipment and capability. Protection<br>
functions, typically implemented by various protective relays,<br>
identify and respond to faults on the power line by using voltage<br>
and current quantities obtained from the power line and<br>
processing those quantities with selected algorithms, involving<br>
the use of logic equations, to provide output control signals<br>
which, if necessary, interrupt the power by means of tripping<br>
signals. It is important to very quickly and accurately identify<br>
fault conditions, to distinguish true fault conditions from load<br>
or other system conditions, and to respond approximately,<br>
providing a tripping signal for a circuit breaker if<br>
necessary . Such action is time-critical for proper operation of<br>
a power system.<br>
Automation control functions, on the other hand, are<br>
concerned with proper functioning (operation) of a substation,<br>
including integration of its operation with the overall power<br>
system. Automation often involves exchange of information with<br>
supervisory devices but is not as critical time-wise as<br>
protection functions. Automation, in one example, involves the<br>
configuration of a substation bus. Substations include motor-<br>
operated switches, as well as circuit breakers, which may be<br>
opened or closed to achieve particular system configurations for<br>
delivery of power to the various feeders leaving the substatation.<br>
System automation includes interlocking functions which prevent<br>
the power system from using operator—initiated settings which<br>
would result in improper or dangerous bus configurations. Another<br>
example of automation is in the control (switching in/out) of<br>
various combinations of elements in the system, including for<br>
example, capacitor banks. Automation thus concerns generally<br>
substation configuration and arrangements, as well as<br>
communication with the other portions of the power system. Proper<br>
automation control requires information from more than one<br>
location within the overall power system.<br>
The automation functions and control are typically<br>
implemented with a programmable logic controller (PLC) which has<br>
a programming ability but also some significant limitations.<br>
These lmitations include lack of complete access to the status<br>
of protection elements. To include a complete access coaabillity<br>
would require a large number of contact inputs «nrt "outputs in<br>
both the protection device and the PLC.<br>
In many cases, the protection and automation functions are,<br>
accomplished by two separate, autonomous devices. Historically,<br>
this autonomy has been deemed to be desirable, because the<br>
protection and automation functions and the engineers/technicans<br>
who deal with them deal with quite different system issues and<br>
requirements. Automation efforts typically require more complex<br>
and customized logic equations to accomplish its tasks than<br>
protection efforts, while protection efforts are more focused on<br>
obtaining the required protection for the power line, with<br>
appropriate settings, and are hence more autonomous than<br>
automation efforts. Accurate protection is typically more<br>
critical to the overall system, because of the ncessity of<br>
monitoring system safety and the need for fast response to system<br>
conditions. However, increased cost is incurred with two<br>
completely separate systems, as well as system inefficiency because<br>
some system data, such as voltage and current quantities obtained<br>
from the power line, are used by both protection and automation<br>
systems.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a single system<br>
for both protection and automation control, while maintaining<br>
the autonomy and separation between the specific control portions<br>
(logic equations) of the protection and automation functions, as<br>
well as separate output contact control in some cases.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present inventon is a system for<br>
maintaining separation of protection and automation functions<br>
present in a single apparatus such as a protective relay, used<br>
for an electric power system, comprising s a single apparatus<br>
which carries out protection and automation functions for a power<br>
system; a first section of logic equations within the apparatus,<br>
accessible by a first password, for defining and performing<br>
selected protection determinations for the power system, wherein<br>
the logic equations present in the first section may be modified<br>
by a user having the frst password, a second section of logic<br>
equations within the apparatus, accessible by a second password<br>
which is different than the first password, for defining and<br>
performing selected automation actions for the power system,<br>
wherein the logic equations in the second section may be modified<br>
by a user having the second password; a shared database within the<br>
apparatus which contains the results of the operation of the<br>
protection and automation logic equations and output logic<br>
equations in the apparatus responsive to the results of the<br>
protection and automation logic equations to set outputs of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
Brief Descripton of the Accompanying Drawing<br>
The figure shows a block diagram showing the arrangement of<br>
the combined system of the present invention.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The figure s a block diagram of the system of the present<br>
invention, generally referred to at 10. System 10 forms a portion<br>
of a protective relay, which is typically located in a substation<br>
and is used to protect the operation of the power system.<br>
Protective relays vary widely in their specific purpose and<br>
capability within the power system.<br>
The system of the present invention permits the protection<br>
functions of the relay, which are controlled by logic equations,<br>
to be modified, i.e. customized, by certain users of the relay as<br>
well as permitting other users of the relay to customize the<br>
automation functionality of the substation and its system.<br>
Both protection and automation function, are accomplished by<br>
logic control equations and those functions can be modified to<br>
fit a user's particular requirement by modification of the<br>
appropriate protection and/or automation logic control equations.<br>
While the term "logic equations" is used throughout the<br>
description, it should be understood that algorithms may be used<br>
instead of logic equations, depending on the particular<br>
protective relay and its capability and other system<br>
considerations. Hence, the term "logic equations" herein should<br>
be considered to include algorithms and equivalent mathematical<br>
operations.<br>
With respect to protection, a logic equation will be used, to<br>
define and control the review of the condition of particular<br>
elements (such as circuit breaker status) as well as processing<br>
voltage and current values from the power line. These equations<br>
will be carried out on a regular periodic basis (e.g. 16 times<br>
per power system cycle) and will produce particular results. If<br>
the results fall within certain ranges, output contacts may be<br>
set and signals generated to, for instance, trip a circuit<br>
breaker. Logic equations are also used to carry out automation<br>
functions and requirements, including system configuration<br>
requirements, such as discussed above.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the protection logic equations and<br>
algorithms 12 are stored in one area in the relay, while the<br>
automation logic equations and algorithms 14 are stored in a<br>
separate area. Both sets of logic equations may be modified by<br>
trained engineers/technicans, including modifications carried out<br>
at the substation or at remote locations by means of a<br>
communication network. However, access to the protection<br>
logic equations 12 and the automation logic equations 14 are by<br>
separate, different passwords. The use of separate storage areas<br>
for the two sets of logic equations and/or algorithms, accessible<br>
by separate passwords, provides the desired autonomy for the two<br>
systems. Protection engineers will have the correct passwords to<br>
access the protection logic equations, while the automation<br>
engineers will have the correct password to access the automation<br>
logic equations. This separate accessing capability is shown by<br>
user password lines 16 and 18. Those personnel who wish to<br>
access both sets of logic equations must have both passwords.<br>
The results of the protection logic equations are stored in<br>
a first area 2O within a system database referred to at 22. Two-<br>
way access (line 24) is provided between the protection logic<br>
equations and the stored results in area 20 of database 22. This<br>
means that the logic equations can write results to area 2O, and<br>
can also obtain information from that area. The protection rogic<br>
equations 12 can change the information in area 20. The<br>
automation logic equations can obtain the information in area 2O<br>
via a read capability, shown by line 26, but cannot change or<br>
provide information to that area.<br>
Similarly, the results of the automation logic equations are<br>
provided to an automation area 28 in the system database 22. This<br>
again involves two-way communication between the automation logic<br>
equations 14 and database area 28, via communication line 29. The<br>
protection logic equations 12 can obtain information from<br>
database area 28 via line 31, but does not have the capability to<br>
write any information to that area or change any information, in<br>
that area. The protection and automation database areas, while<br>
functionally separate, are part of the single, common system<br>
database 22, thus promoting efficiency and speed of operation.<br>
Both the protection and automation logic equations do have<br>
access to system information area 30, also in database 22. System<br>
information area 30 includes analog information, such as voltages<br>
and currents which are periodically obtained from the power<br>
line, as well as other system control bits, etc., which may be<br>
applicable to both the automation and protection logic equations.<br>
As indicated in Figure 1, all three information areas 20, 28 and<br>
3O are contained within the system database 22. It is important<br>
that both protection and automation logic equations have access<br>
to system information mica 3O. For instance, both protection and<br>
automation functions can use reactive power information.<br>
Protection uses reactive power information for various purposes,<br>
including breaker failure determination, while automation uses<br>
the same information to control the configuration of capacitor<br>
banks in the system. In another example, protection uses current<br>
values from the power line for over-current protection , while<br>
automation uses the same information for the interlockig<br>
function described above.<br>
The system of the present invention further include, an<br>
output logic equations/settings area, which responds to the<br>
information in data areas 20, 28 and 30 to configure the relay<br>
output contacts. The output contacts provide control signals which<br>
results in certain actions, such as tripping a circuit breaker<br>
etc. The output logic equations/settings, which process the<br>
results from the protection and automation logic equations, are<br>
programmable and hence can be altered by either protection,<br>
engineers or automation engineers. These output contacts can be<br>
completely separate, if desired, or the respective engineers can<br>
collaborate/consult to use a single set of output contacts.<br>
Accordingly, a system has been disclosed by which protection<br>
and automation functions can be set and controlled by<br>
separate sets of logic equations stored in different areas of a<br>
single apparatus, such as a protective relay, which thus improves<br>
overall operational efficiency, while maintaining separate,<br>
autonomous access for the two sets of logic: equations.<br>
Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been<br>
disclosed here for purposes of illustration, it should be<br>
understood that various changes, modifications and substitutions<br>
may be incorporated without departing from the spirit of the<br>
invention, which is defined by the claims which follows.<br>
