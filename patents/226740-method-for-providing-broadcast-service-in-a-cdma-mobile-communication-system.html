				<td>BACKGROUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to broadcast services, and in particular,<br>
to a method for more efficiently providing broadcast services in a mobile<br>
communication system using code division multiple access (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "CDMA") technology.<br>
In the future, communications environments will undergo rapid changes<br>
regardless of wired/wireless region or country. In particular, the communications<br>
environment, such as IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication-2000),<br>
tends to synthetically provide users with various information needs including<br>
image and voice information on a real-time basis. With the development of<br>
mobile communication technology, even in a cellular wireless communication<br>
system or PCS (Personal Communications System) mobile communication<br>
system, a mobile station (MS) has the ability to not only simply perform voice<br>
communication but also to transmit text information and to receive broadcast<br>
services.<br>
At present, 3GPP2 (3rd Generation Partnership Project 2) considers the efficient<br>
utilization of various service media and resources for a broadcast service in a<br>
mobile communication system. Such a broadcast service is performed by<br>
unidirectionally transmitting high-speed forward data without receiving reverse<br>
feedback information from a mobile station. A broadcast service in a mobile<br>
communication system is characterized in that a plurality of base stations (BSs)<br>
simultaneously transmit the same data stream. This is conceptually similar to a<br>
general television broadcasting service.<br>
If a common channel is designed so as to guarantee the same performance even<br>
at a cell boundary, cell capacity is excessively wasted. Therefore, in a 3rd<br>
generation mobile communication system, a structure of a supplemental channel<br>
proposed as a dedicated channel for a packet data service is partially modified<br>
to realize high-speed transmission for a broadcast service. The supplemental<br>
channel uses a common long code mask instead of a long code mask dedicated<br>
to a user, for a broadcast service. During a broadcast service, autonomous<br>
handoff not requiring feedback information from a mobile station and outer<br>
coding are performed to guarantee performance higher than or equal to that of<br>
an existing common channel.<br>
In an existing wireless broadcast service under discussion, a broadcast service<br>
provider is limited to a specific broadcast server or a contents server designated<br>
by a common carrier, so mobile stations can only passively receive the broadcast<br>
service. Therefore, the service provider cannot charge for the broadcast service<br>
according to its service time or quantity. In addition, because the same data<br>
stream is simultaneously transmitted from several base stations as stated above,<br>
network resources for a broadcast service must be assigned to all the base<br>
stations, preventing efficient utilization of resources.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a broadcast service<br>
method for simultaneously transmitting and receiving voice, text and image data<br>
between mobile stations in a mobile communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a broadcast service<br>
method for forming a group of mobile stations in a network, and simultaneously<br>
transmitting and receiving voice, text or image data between the mobile stations<br>
in the group.<br>
It is further another object of the present invention to provide a broadcast<br>
service method capable of efficiently using wired/wireless resources of a base<br>
station and a network.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a broadcast service<br>
method capable of controlling a transmission time of a base station and<br>
assignment of network resources.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
receiving a broadcast service by a mobile station in a wireless broadcast service<br>
system including the mobile station existing in a service area, a base station<br>
capable of connecting a wireless channel, a packet data serving node for<br>
connecting the base station to a packet communication network, a broadcast<br>
server connected to the packet communication network, and an authentication<br>
server connected to the packet communication network. The method comprises<br>
the steps of; performing user authentication by setting up a connection with the<br>
authentication server, and receiving, if the user authentication is passed,<br>
information on available broadcast services from the broadcasting server;<br>
registering a desired broadcast service in the packet data serving node based on<br>
the received information so that the packet data serving node assigns a network<br>
resource for the desired broadcast service; if the desired broadcast service is<br>
authorized by the packet data serving node, registering the desired broadcast<br>
service in the base station so that the base station assigns a wireless broadcast<br>
supplemental channel and a network resource for the desired broadcast service;<br>
and receiving broadcast data for the desired broadcast service over the<br>
broadcast supplemental channel assigned to the base station.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method<br>
for providing a broadcast service to a mobile station by a base station in a<br>
wireless broadcast service system including the mobile station existing in a<br>
service area, the base station capable of connecting a wireless channels, a<br>
packet data serving node for connection the base station to packet<br>
communication network, a broadcast server connected to the packet<br>
communication network, and an authentication server connected to the packet<br>
communication network. The method comprises the steps of; upon receiving a<br>
broadcast service registration request from the mobile station, determining<br>
whether the requested broadcast service is already being provided; if the<br>
requested broadcast service is not being provided, registering the requested<br>
broadcast service in the packet data serving node so that the packet data serving<br>
node assigns a network resource for the requested broadcast service; and if the<br>
requested broadcast service is authorized by the packet data serving node,<br>
assigning a wireless broadcast supplemental channel for the broadcast service<br>
and transmitting broadcast data for the requested broadcast service received<br>
from the packet data serving node to the mobile station over the assigned<br>
broadcast supplemental channel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the attached drawings. In the drawings, it should be<br>
noted that the same or similar elements are denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals even though they are depicted in different drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The disclosed embodiments of the present invention are characterized in that in<br>
a mobile communication system supporting a broadcast service, a broadcast<br>
server or a specific mobile station provides a broadcast service to registered<br>
mobile stations constituting a logical group. A packet data serving node (PDSN)<br>
authenticates mobile stations registered in a broadcast service receiving group,<br>
and controls base stations servicing corresponding mobile stations to assign a<br>
forward broadcast supplemental channel (hereinafter referred to as "F-BSCH").<br>
Herein, reference will be made to a structure of a mobile communication system<br>
and a wireless channel based on 3GPP2 in order to describe an operating<br>
principal of the present invention. However, it should be readily understood by<br>
those of skill in the art that the present invention is not limited to 3GPP2<br>
implementations.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a common broadcast service system. Referring to Figure 1, a<br>
broadcast server or contents server (CS) 14 generates an IP packet by<br>
compressing image and/or voice data for a broadcast service, i.e., broadcast<br>
data, according to an Internet protocol (IP), and delivers the IP packet to base<br>
stations (BS) 12a, 12b and 12c via packet data serving nodes (PDSNs) 13a and<br>
13b over a packet communication network such as the Internet. Each of the<br>
base stations 12a, 12b and 12c are comprised of a base transceiver subsystem<br>
(BTS), a base station controller (BSC), and a packet control function unit (PCF),<br>
and thus, they are represented by BS/PCF.<br>
In order to deliver the broadcast data generated by the broadcast server 14 to<br>
the base stations 12a, 12b and 12c, IP multicast technology is used. The base<br>
stations 12a, 12b and 12c form a multicast group which is provided with IP<br>
multicast data from the broadcast server 14. Membership information of the<br>
multicast group is retained by an undepicted multicast router (MR) connected to<br>
each of the base stations 12a, 12b and 12c. That is, IP multicast data including<br>
the image and/or voice data generated by the broadcast server 14 is<br><br>
broadcasted to the base stations 12a, 12b and 12c forming the multicast group,<br>
and the base stations 12a, 12b and 12c convert the IP multicast data into a radio<br>
frequency (RF) signal, and then transmit the RF signal in their service areas.<br>
In Figure 1, however, the base stations 12a, 12b and 12c always transmit the<br>
broadcast data regardless of whether a mobile station exists in their service<br>
areas. Thus, the base stations 12a, 12b and 12c may unnecessarily waste wired<br>
and wireless resources, and mobile stations 11a, 11b and 11c located in the<br>
service areas of the base stations 12a, 12b and 12c must passively receive the<br>
broadcast data.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the configuration of a broadcast service system in which an<br>
authenticated mobile station serves as a source of a broadcast service according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figure 2, a mobile<br>
station 21a, serving as a broadcast service source authenticated by an<br>
authentication server (or an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)<br>
server) 24, has been registered in a packet data serving node (PDSN) 23a to<br>
provide a broadcast service. Broadcast data transmitted over a reverse<br>
fundamental channel (hereinafter referred to as "RFCH") established between<br>
the mobile station 21a and its associated base station 22a is provided to base<br>
stations 22b and 22c by packet data serving nodes 23a and 23b. The base<br>
stations 22b and 22c provide the broadcast data to mobile stations 21b and 21c<br>
in their service areas over forward broadcast supplemental channels (F-BSCHs).<br>
The broadcast data is transmitted in the form of IP multicast data. The mobile<br>
stations 21b and 21c provided with the broadcast data have been registered in<br><br>
the corresponding packet data serving nodes 23a and 23b for broadcast<br>
reception, forming a logical group. The authenticated mobile station 21a can<br>
transmit broadcast data to the registered mobile stations 21b and 21c.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates configuration of a broadcast service system in which an<br>
authenticated broadcast server serves as a source of a broadcast service<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figure 3,<br>
a broadcast server 36 serves as a broadcast service source authenticated by an<br>
authentication server (or an AAA server) 34, and broadcast data transmitted in<br>
the form of IP multicast data by the broadcast server 36 is directly delivered to<br>
an adjacent packet data serving node 33b and also delivered to a packet data<br>
serving node 33a of another network via a multicast router (MR) 35. The packet<br>
data serving nodes 33a and 33b transmit the broadcast data to base stations<br>
32a, 32b and 32c that service mobile stations 31a, 31b and 31c registered for a<br>
broadcast service. The base stations 32a, 32b and 32c provide the broadcast<br>
data to the mobile stations 31a, 31b and 31c over forward broadcast<br>
supplemental channels (F-BSCHs). The mobile stations 31a, 31b and 31c<br>
provided with the broadcast data have been registered in the corresponding<br>
packet data serving nodes 33a and 33b for broadcast reception, forming a logical<br>
group. As a result, the authenticated broadcast server 36 can transmit broadcast<br>
data to the registered mobile stations 31a, 31b and 31c.<br>
With reference to Figures 4 to 12, a description will now be made of an operation<br>
of providing a broadcast service in mobile communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a message flow diagram illustrating a procedure for registering a<br>
broadcast service desired by a mobile station in a packet data serving node<br>
(PDSN) via a base station to thereby assign system and network resources<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 4, a<br>
packet data serving node and a base station start providing a broadcast service<br>
only at the request of a mobile station, rather than always providing the<br>
broadcast service.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, in step 100, a mobile station (MS) sets up a connection to<br>
an authentication server (AM) according to a point-to-point protocol (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "PPP"), and then sends a user authentication request to the<br>
authentication server (AAA) through the set connection in order to request a<br>
broadcast service, if the authentication is passed, the authentication server<br>
delivers information on broadcast services that the mobile station can receive to<br>
a corresponding packet data serving node (PDSN) in step 102, the information<br>
being stored in its database through a service authorization procedure.<br>
The delivered information includes broadcast multicast service identifiers<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "BCMCS IDs") for identifying broadcast services,<br>
multicast IP addresses and source IP addresses for identifying sources that<br>
provide a broadcast service, or includes a table identifier by which the above<br>
parameters can be searched from a database of the packet data serving node<br>
(PDSN).<br>
In step 104, the mobile station connects a call to a broadcast server (or a<br>
contents server (CS)) using a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or a section<br>
description protocol (SDP), and receives session information related to broadcast<br><br>
services from the broadcast server. This is achieved through a dedicated channel<br>
by using a call based on Service Option 33 (hereinafter referred to as "SO33")<br>
designating a packet data service. In step 106, the mobile station sends an IGMP<br>
(Internet Group Management Protocol) message to the packet data serving node<br>
along with a multicast IP address corresponding to a desired broadcast service.<br>
The packet data serving node analyzes the requested multicast IP address<br>
included in the IGMP message.<br>
In the case where the packet data serving node is already servicing the<br>
corresponding broadcast contents while the multicast IP address requested in<br>
step 104 by the mobile station is identical to a multicast IP address authorized in<br>
step 102 by the authentication server, the packet data serving node does not<br>
require new management such as system and network resource assignment for<br>
providing a broadcast service. On the other hand, in the case where the<br>
requested multicast IP address is identical to the authorized multicast IP address<br>
but the packet data serving note is not performing the service, the packet data<br>
serving node registers the requested multicast IP address in a multicast IP<br>
routing table of its internal database.<br>
If the requested multicast IP address is not identical to the authorized multicast<br>
IP address, the packet data serving node inquires of the authentication server<br>
about whether the requested multicast IP address is available, through an<br>
optional service authentication procedure, in step 108. If it is determined that<br><br>
the requested multicast IP address is available, the packet data serving node<br>
registers the requested multicast IP address in the multicast IP routing table, and<br>
builds a multicast IP spanning tree by communicating a routing message<br>
indicating the particulars registered in the routing table with neighboring routers.<br>
After the requested multicast IP address is analyzed, the packet data serving<br>
node transmits an IGMP message to the mobile station in response to the IGMP<br>
message in step 110. In step 112, the broadcast server starts transmitting<br>
broadcast data for the corresponding broadcast service to the packet data<br>
serving node.<br>
At this moment, the mobile station has already received all information necessary<br>
for reception of a broadcast service, and in particular session information,<br>
BCMCS_ID, and multicast IP address. Therefore, in step 114, the mobile station<br>
sends a registration request for the desired broadcast service corresponding to<br>
the BCMCS_ID and the multicast IP address to a base station (BS) over an<br>
access channel, using the session information. The base station then analyzes<br>
the BCMCSJD and the multicast IP address, registration of which was requested<br>
by the mobile station.<br>
If a broadcast service corresponding to the BCMCSJD and the multicast I?<br>
address is not currently being provided by the base station, the base station<br>
must newly assign wired and wireless resources for the broadcast service. Thus,<br>
in step 116, the base station sends a packet control function unit (PCF) a call<br>
setup message (A9-Setup-A8) carrying the BCMCS_ID and the multicast IP<br>
address. In step 118, the packet control function unit sends the packet data<br><br>
serving node a registration request message (All-Registration Request) carrying<br>
the BCMCS_ID and the multicast IP address, in response to the call setup<br>
message.<br>
In step 120, the packet data serving node transmits to the packet control<br>
function unit a registration response message (All-Registration Reply) indicating<br>
that a broadcast service corresponding to the BCMCS_ID and the multicast IP<br>
address was authorized, in response to the registration request message. In step<br>
122, the packet control function unit (PCF) determines from the registration<br>
response message that the broadcast service was authorize, and then delivers a<br>
connection message (A9-Connect-A8) for notifying this situation, to the base<br>
station. The base station then assigns wired and wireless resources as well as a<br>
forward broadcast supplemental channel (F-BSCH) for the broadcast service, and<br>
starts the broadcast service. That is, the base station receives broadcast data<br>
from the broadcast server via the packet data serving node, and starts<br>
transmitting the received broadcast data over the forward broadcast<br>
supplemental channel (F-BSCH).<br>
In step 124, the mobile station receives the broadcast data by tuning to the<br>
forward broadcast supplemented channel corresponding to the BCMCSJD. A<br>
plurality of mobile stations desiring to receive the same broadcast service are<br>
registered as a broadcast service receiving group, and the broadcast service in<br>
the packet data serving node and the base station continues until a<br>
predetermined broadcast timer expires or all mobile stations terminate (or leave)<br>
their broadcast services.<br><br>
Figure 5 is a flowchart illustrating an operation performed by a mobile station to<br>
initiate a broadcast service as shown in Figure 4. Referring to Figure 5, a mobile<br>
station desiring to receive a broadcast service sends a user authentication<br>
request to an authentication server through PPP connection in step S100, and<br>
receives service authorization information for the user in response to the user<br>
authentication request in step S102. If the user is not authorized in step S102,<br>
the flow ends. In step S104, if session information for broadcast services is<br>
received from a broadcast server, the mobile station requests, in step S106, the<br>
desired broadcast service by transmitting information related to the desired<br>
broadcast service,, i.e., BCMCS_ID and multicast IP address, to a packet data<br>
serving node.<br>
If a broadcast service authorization response is received in step S108 in response<br>
to the broadcast service request, the mobile station transmits in step S110 a<br>
registration request for the desired broadcast service corresponding to the<br>
BCMCS_ID and the multicast IP address to a base station in order to register the<br>
desired broadcast service. If the service is not authorized in step S108, the flow<br>
ends. The base station then transmits broadcast data for the broadcast service in<br>
response to the registration request. In step S112, the mobile station receives<br>
the broadcast data for the desired broadcast service.<br>
Figure 6 is a flowchart illustrating an operation performed by a base station to<br>
initiate a broadcast service as shown in Figure 4. Referring to Figure 6, if a<br>
registration request for a broadcast service that a mobile station desires to<br>
receive is received in step S200, a base station determines in step S202 whether<br><br>
the broadcast service is already being provided. If the broadcast service is<br>
currently in operation, the base station proceeds to step S210 where it continues<br>
to transmit broadcast data for the broadcast service. However, if the broadcast<br>
service is not being provided, the base station sends a broadcast service request<br>
to a packet data serving node in step S204. If it is determined in step S206 that<br>
the broadcast service was authorized, the base station assigns a wireless<br>
broadcast supplemental channel and a network resource for the broadcast<br>
service in step S208, and then transmits broadcast data for the broadcast service<br>
over the assigned broadcast supplemental channel in step S210,<br>
Figure 7 is a flowchart illustrating an operation performed by a packet data<br>
serving node to initiate a broadcast service as shown in Figure 4. Referring to<br>
Figure 7, if information on broadcast services available for a mobile station is<br>
received from a broadcast server in step S300, and BCMCS_ID and a multicast IP<br>
address for a broadcast service desired by the mobile station is received in step<br>
S302, a packet data serving node determines in step S304 whether the multicast<br>
IP address is identical to a multicast IP address for the broadcast services<br>
available for the mobile station. Here, the multicast IP address for the broadcast<br>
services available for the mobile station is included in the information received<br>
from the broadcast server.<br>
If the multicast IP addresses are not identical to each other, the packet data<br>
serving node inquires, in step S316, of an authentication server about whether<br>
the multicast IP address for the desired broadcast service is available. If it is<br>
determined in step S318 that the multicast IP address for the desired broadcast<br><br>
service is not available, the packet data serving node ends the operation, and<br>
otherwise, proceeds to step S308.<br>
If the multicast IP addresses are identical to each other in step S304, the packet<br>
data serving node determines in step S306 whether the desired broadcast<br>
service corresponding to the multicast IP address is currently being provided. If<br>
the desired broadcast service corresponding to the multicast IP address is<br>
currently not in operation, the packet data serving node registers in step S308<br>
the multicast IP address for the desired broadcast service in a multicast IP<br>
routing table. However, if the desired broadcast service corresponding to the<br>
multicast IP address is currently in operation, the packet data serving node<br>
proceeds to step S310. In step S310, the packet data serving node starts<br>
receiving broadcast data for the registered broadcast service from the broadcast<br>
server.<br>
If a registration request for the broadcast service corresponding to the multicast<br>
IP address registered in the multicast IP routing table is received from a base<br>
station in step S312, the packet data serving node delivers the corresponding<br>
broadcast data received from the broadcast server to the base station in step<br>
S314.<br>
Figure 8 is a message flow diagram illustrating a procedure for returning<br>
resources by a mobile station after leaving (or terminating) a broadcast service<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figure 8, in<br>
step 200, a plurality of mobile stations (MSs) registered as a broadcast service<br><br>
receiving group receives broadcast data for a broadcast service from a broadcast<br>
server (or a contents server (CS)). In step 202, one of the mobile stations sends<br>
a broadcast service leave request to a packet data serving node (PDSN) through<br>
a leave procedure based on IGMP. In step 204, the mobile station sends a<br>
BCMCS de-registration message to a base station (BS). The base station<br>
determines whether each of the mobile stations registered as the broadcast<br>
service receiving group has left its broadcast service, depending on whether the<br>
BCMCS de-registration message was received or whether a broadcast timer has<br>
expired.<br>
If the mobile station that transmitted the BCMCS de-registration message is the<br>
last mobile station that was using a corresponding broadcast supplemental<br>
channel in its service area, the base station stops in step 206 the use of<br>
resources (i.e., broadcast supplemental channel and network resource), and then<br>
transmits in step 208 a release message (A9-Release-A8) to a packet control<br>
function unit (PCF) in order to return the resources. In this case, the packet<br>
control function unit does not send a response for the release message. This is<br>
because when a plurality of base stations are connected to one packet control<br>
function unit, there may exist other base stations, which are providing a<br>
corresponding broadcast service.<br>
If all of the base stations connected to the packet control function unit determine<br>
that all mobile stations that were receiving the broadcast supplemental channel<br>
have left the broadcast service, the packet control function unit transmits in step<br>
210 a release complete message (Complete A9-Release-A8) to all the base<br><br>
stations connected thereto. Then, the packet control function unit and the packet<br>
data serving node release all network resources related to the broadcast service.<br>
Figure 9 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of leaving a broadcast service by<br>
a base station as illustrated in figure 8. Referring to Figure 9, in step S400,<br>
broadcast data for a broadcast service desired by a mobile station is transmitted<br>
from a base station to the mobile station. If a broadcast service leave request is<br>
received in step S402, or a broadcast service of a particular mobile station is left<br>
as a broadcast timer expires, the base station determines in step S404 whether<br>
the particular mobile station is the last mobile station that uses the<br>
corresponding broadcast supplemental channel. If the particular mobile station is<br>
the last mobile station, the base station releases the broadcast channel and<br>
withdraws the network resource in step S406. Otherwise, if the particular mobile<br>
station is not the last mobile station, the base station maintains the broadcast<br>
supplemental channel.<br>
Figure 10 is a message flow diagram illustrating a procedure for performing<br>
accounting on a broadcast service of a mobile station according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figure 10, in step 300, a<br>
mobile station (MS) desiring to receive a broadcast service connects a call based<br>
on Service Option 33 (hereinafter referred to as "SO33") through a dedicated<br>
channel assigned between the mobile station and a base station (BS), establishes<br>
PPP connection with a packet data serving node (PDSN), and then receives<br>
information for the broadcast service from a broadcast server (or a contents<br>
server (CS)) through the PPP connection. Thereafter, if the broadcast service is<br><br>
registered, the dedicated channel is released and the SO33-based call transitions<br>
to a dormant state, in step 302.<br>
In the dormant state, a broadcaster service parameter message (BSPM) is<br>
transmitted form the base station to the mobile station through an overhead<br>
message. The overhead message includes a physical channel parameter, a<br>
logical parameter and mapping information for a broadcast service.<br>
In step 304, the mobile station registers the desired broadcast service in the<br>
base station through an access channel. In step 306, the base station transmits a<br>
call setup message (A9-Setup-A8) to a packet control function unit (PCF) in<br>
response to a broadcast service registration request from the mobile station. In<br>
this case, the call setup message includes information on a time when the mobile<br>
station registered the broadcast service i.e., information on a service start time.<br>
In step 308, the packet control functions unit receives the call setup message,<br>
searches a packet data serving node that can provide the desired broadcast<br>
service, based on IMSI (International Mobile System Identifier) of the mobile<br>
station, and then transmits a registration message (All Registration) with service<br>
start time information to the packet data serving node. The packet data serving<br>
node then assigns system and network resources for the broadcast service in<br>
response to the registration message, and generates accounting information<br>
based on the IMSI and the service start time information.<br><br>
If the mobile station transmits a de-registration message to the base station in<br>
step 310 or the broadcast service of the mobile station is left as a broadcast<br>
timer expires, the base station transmits in step 312 a release message (A9-<br>
Release-A8) including IMSI of the mobile station and service leave time<br>
information (i.e. information on a time when the mobile station deregistered the<br>
broadcast service) to the packet control function unit. In step 314, the packet<br>
control function unit searches corresponding connection information of the<br>
mobile station according to the IMSI in response to the release message, and<br>
transmits a registration message (All Registration) with service leave time<br>
information to the packet data serving node according to the searched<br>
connection information. In this case, the connection information means<br>
connection information based on an interface set during SO33 setup in step 30,<br>
rather than an interface set for broadcasting.<br>
Figure 11 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of performing accounting on a<br>
broadcast service by a base station and a packet data serving node as shown in<br>
Figure 10. Referring to Figure 11 if a base station receives in step S500 a<br>
broadcast service registration request from a mobile station, the base station<br>
generates in step S502 broadcast service registration time information (i.e.,<br>
service start time information) and transmits the generates broadcast service<br>
registration time information to a packet data serving node. In step S504, the<br>
packet data serving node starts generating accounting information, using the<br>
broadcast service registration time information. In step S506, the broadcast<br>
service is performed. If the broadcast service is left in step S508, the base<br>
station generates information on a time when the broadcast service is left in step<br><br>
S510, and transmits the generated broadcast service leave time information to<br>
the packet data serving node. In step S512, the packet data serving node<br>
generates accounting information related to the broadcast service, using the<br>
broadcast service registration time information and the broadcast service leave<br>
time information.<br>
Figure 12 is a message flow diagram illustrating a procedure for assigning<br>
broadcast service resources using a registration message according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 12 compared with Figure 4, a<br>
mobile station registers a broadcast service using a registration message instead<br>
of using an IGMP message.<br>
Referring to Figure 12, in step 400, a mobile station (MS) sends a user<br>
authentication request to an authentication server (AAA) through PPP connection<br>
in order to request a broadcast service. If the user authentication is completed,<br>
the authentication server delivers in step 402 to a corresponding packet data<br>
serving node (PDSN) information on broadcast services that the user can receive,<br>
the information being stored in a database of the authentication server.<br>
The delivered information includes broadcast multicast service identifiers<br>
(BCMCS_ IDs) for identifying broadcast services, multicast IP addresses and<br>
source IP addresses for identifying sources that provide a broadcast service, or<br>
includes a table identifier by which the above parameters can be searched from a<br>
database of the packet data serving node (PDSN).<br><br>
In step 404, the mobile station sets up a call based on Service Option 33 (SO33)<br>
designating a packet data service through a dedicated channel, and receives<br>
session information related to broadcast services from a broadcast server (or a<br>
contents server, (CS)), using HTTP or SDP. In step 406, the mobile station<br>
transmits a registration message with BCMCS_ID and multicast IP address<br>
corresponding to a desired broadcast service, to a base station (BS) over an<br>
access channel.<br>
In step 408, the base station sends a packet control function unit (PCF) a call<br>
setup message (A9-Setup-A8) carrying the BCMCSJD and the multicast IP<br>
address. In step 410, the packet control function unit sends the packet data<br>
serving node a registration request message (All-Registration Request) carrying<br>
the BCMCSJD and the multicast IP address in response to the call setup<br>
message. The packet data serving node then analyzes the requested multicast IP<br>
address in response to the registration request message.<br>
In the case where the packet data serving node is already servicing the<br>
corresponding broadcasting contents while the multicast IP address requested by<br>
the mobile station is identical to the multicast IP address authorized in step 402<br>
by the authentication server, the packet data serving node does not require new<br>
management such as system and network resource assignment for providing a<br>
broadcast service. On the other hand, in the case where the requested multicast<br>
IP address is identical to the authorized multicast IP address but the packet data<br>
serving node is not performing the service, the packet data serving node<br>
registers the requested multicast IP address in a multicast IP routing table.<br><br>
If the requested multicast IP address is not identical to the authorized multicast<br>
IP address, the packet data serving node inquires of the authentication server<br>
about whether the requested multicast IP address is available, through an<br>
optional service authentication procedure, in step 412. If it is determined that<br>
the requested multicast IP address is available, the packet data serving node<br>
registers the requested multicast IP address in the multicast IP routing table, and<br>
builds a multicast IP spanning tree by communication a routing message<br>
indicating the particulars registered in the routing table with neighboring routers.<br>
After the requested multicast IP address is analyzed, the broadcast server starts<br>
transmitting broadcast data for the corresponding broadcast service to the<br>
packet data serving node, in step 414. Subsequently, in step 416, the packet<br>
data serving node transmits to the packet control function unit a registration<br>
response message (All-Registration Reply) indicating that a broadcast service<br>
corresponding to the BCMCS_ID and the multicast IP address was authorized, in<br>
response to the registration request message. In step 418, the packet control<br>
function unit determines from the registration response message that the<br>
broadcast service was authorized, and then delivers a connection message (A9-<br>
Connect-A8) for notifying this situation, to the base station. In step 420, the<br>
mobile station receives the broadcast data by tuning to the forward broadcast<br>
supplemental channel corresponding to the BCMCS_ID.<br>
The disclosed embodiments of the present invention control transmission of a<br>
broadcast service data stream according to base station areas through<br>
registration of a broadcast service of a mobile station, thereby minimizing a<br>
waste of wired/wireless resources. Therefore, embodiments of the present<br><br>
invention can efficiently use base station resources by controlling broadcast<br>
service times of base stations, and efficiently use resources of the base stations<br>
and a network when a plurality of mobile stations simultaneously request<br>
broadcast services.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described herein with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
