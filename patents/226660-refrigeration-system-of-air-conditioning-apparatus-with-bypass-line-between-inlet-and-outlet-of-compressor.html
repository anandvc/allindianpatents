REFRIGERATION SYSTEM OF AIR CONDITIONING APPARATUSES WITH BYPASS LINE BETWEEN INLET AND OUTLET OF COMPRESSOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a refrigeration system of an air conditiomng apparatus, and more particularly to a refrigeration system of an air conditioning apparatus with a bypass line connected between an inlet and an outlet of a compressor, which is adapted to supply a part or all of refrigerant discharged from a compressor back to the compressor again, to compress the refrigerant.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, a refrigeration system of an air conditioning apparatus performs cooling and heating operations in such a way that the air conditioning apparatus absorbs heat from the air in a space to be air conditioned and discharges the heat outside the space, or the air conditioning apparatus absorbs heat from the outside air of the space to be air conditioned and supplies the heat into the space, by using the phase change of refrigerant.<br>
The refrigerant is circulated in a circulation cycle comprised of evaporation - compression - condensation - expansion - evaporation during the cooling operation, while the refrigerant is circulated in a circulation cycle comprised of evaporation - expansion - condensation - compression -evaporation during the heating operation.<br>
Such a refrigeration system of an air conditioning apparatus commonly includes a cooling system which is designed to lower a temperature of air in a space to be air conditioned (because the space to be air conditioned is generally a room, the space will be referred to as a room while the outside of the space to be air conditioned will be merely referred to as the outside of the room hereinafter, for the sake of convenience in explanation), a heating system which is designed to<br><br>
raise a temperature of air in the room, and a cooling and heating system which is designed to lower or raise a temperature of air in the room according to a user's selection.<br>
A conventional refrigeration system includes an indoor unit installed in the room, an outdoor unit installed outside the room, a compressor which draws refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure, compresses the refrigerant under the adiabatic condition to cause the refrigerant to have higher temperature and higher pressure, and discharges the refrigerant in the state of higher temperature and higher pressure, an expansion unit which allows for expansion of the refrigerant in a state of higher temperature and higher pressure under the adiabatic condition to cause the refrigerant to have lower temperature and lower pressure, and discharges the refrigerant in the state of lower temperature and lower pressure, a piping to connect the indoor unit, the outdoor unit, the compressor and the expansion unit to each other to allow the refrigerant to be circulated in a predetermined circulating path, various sensors provided at predetermined positions to monitor a temperature, a pressure and the like of the refrigerant, and a control unit to allow electricity to be supplied to the components such as compressor and the sensors and controls operations of the components such as the compressor, based on information received from the sensors. The refrigeration system further includes valves to change a circulating path of the refrigerant.<br>
An operation of cooling a room by a cooling system or a heating system, and an operation of heating a room by a heating system or a cooling and heating system will now be described in detail.<br>
In a cooling operation, liquid refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure, which is introduced into the indoor unit, and then discharged to the compressor. The refrigerant in the state of lower temperature and lower pressure is compressed in the compressor, resulting in the refrigerant in higher temperature and higher pressure, and the refrigerant in higher temperature and higher pressure is discharged as gaseous refrigerant. The gaseous refrigerant in the state of higher temperature and higher pressure, which is discharged from the<br><br>
compressor, is introduced into the outdoor unit, and then condensed into liquid refrigerant in a state of higher temperature and higher pressure while radiating heat outside the room. The condensed liquid refrigerant is discharged to the expansion unit. The liquid refrigerant in a state of higher temperature and higher pressure, which is introduced into the expansion unit, is expanded, resulting in liquid refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure, and then discharged to the indoor unit. As such, the refrigerant is circulated in the circulating cycle in the above-mentioned manner.<br>
In a heating operation, gaseous refrigerant in a state of higher temperature and higher pressure, which is introduced into the indoor unit, is condensed into liquid refrigerant in a state of higher temperature and higher pressure while radiating heat to the room, and then discharged to the expansion unit. The liquid refrigerant in the state of higher temperature and higher pressure, which is introduced into the indoor unit, is expanded, resulting in liquid refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure, and then discharged to the outdoor unit. The liquid refrigerant in the state of lower temperature and lower pressure, which is introduced into the outdoor unit, evaporates while absorbing heat from the outside air of the room, resulting in gaseous refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure, and then discharged to the compressor. The gaseous refrigerant, which is introduced into the compressor from the outdoor unit, is compressed into gaseous refrigerant in a state of higher temperature and higher pressure, and then discharged to the indoor unit. As such, the refrigerant is circulated in the circulating cycle in the above-mentioned manner.<br>
In the above conventional refrigeration system of air conditioning apparatus, the refrigerant into the compressor and the refrigerant discharged from the compressor must be maintained in a preset range in order to execute appropriate cooling and heating operations in the optimal circulation cycle without possible damage to the compressor.<br>
It is preferable to control a temperature of the refrigerant, which is introduced into the compressor, to be slightly higher than that of a saturated<br><br>
refrigerant in which gaseous refrigerant and liquid refrigerant exist together, thereby allowing only gaseous refrigerant to exist in the compressor. This is because a compression capability of the compressor is lowered and the components of the compressor are damaged in a case that the liquid refrigerant is introduced into the compressor. Furthermore, when a temperature of the refrigerant, which is introduced into the compressor, is excessively raised compared to that of the saturated refrigerant in which gaseous refrigerant and liquid refrigerant exist together, the components of the compressor are deteriorated, thereby causing a service life and compression efficiency of the compressor to be drastically shortened and lowered.<br>
Of the above problems, the former problem can be overcome by a simple method of supplying gaseous refrigerant separated through a gas-liquid separator to the compressor. The latter problem can be overcome by a method of lowering a temperature of refrigerant introduced into the compressor to prevent a temperature of the refrigerant from excessively rising than a temperature of the saturated refrigerant in which gaseous refrigerant and liquid refrigerant exist together, thereby lowering a compression load of the compressor, as disclosed in Korean Patent Application Nos. 2000-56277,2000-56278 and 2000-56279.<br>
Meanwhile, when a pressure of refrigerant, which is introduced into or discharged from the compressor, is excessively lowered, or an outside temperature of the compressor is excessively lowered, there are various problems, such as condensation on the compressor and malfunction of cooling and heating operations. However, methods of solving these problems are not proposed in any documents.<br>

The third connecting line 496 is provided with an ON/OFF valve 496a.<br>
FIG. 20 shows a modification of the fifth embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 17. In a description of the modification shown in FIG. 20, a description relating to the same parts as those of the embodiment shown in FIG. 17 is omitted, and only a description relating to parts different from those of the embodiment of FIG. 17 is disclosed herein.<br>
In this modification, the expansion unit 410 of the fifth embodiment shown in FIG. 17 is substituted with an expansion complex 410' comprised of a plurality of expansion units 410A and 410B, which are arranged in series or in parallel with respect to the refrigerant path, and the compressor 430 of the fifth embodiment shown in FIG. 17 is substituted with a compressor complex 430' comprised of a plurality of compressors 430A and 430B, which are arranged in<br><br>

It is to be understood that the positions of the refrigerant inlets, the refrigerant outlets and the refrigerant inlet/outlets are not limited by any of the details of the above description, but rather are constructed broadly.<br>
According to this modification, the refrigeration system 400' can increase expansion and compression capabilities with the aid of the component complexes comprised of a plurality of component units, and also can alleviate expansion and compression loads of the respective component units.<br>
The first auxiliary expansion complex 471' is preferably provided at its<br><br>

The refrigeration system according to the present invention, which is adapted to be operated under a low compression load, may be applied to a cooling system which performs only a cooling operation as well as a heating system which performs only a heating operation. A construction of the refrigeration system, which is adapted to execute only a cooling operation or only a heating operation, can be obtained by omitting some dispensable components from the refrigeration systems shown in FIGS. 1 through 20. Since such constructions of the refrigeration system will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, a detailed description relating to that is omitted herein. Of course, it is to be understood that all such modifications to the system fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
While each of the refrigeration systems according to the first to fifth embodiments of the present invention has been described as being constructed by only one indoor unit 20, 120, 220, 320 or 420, the refrigeration system may be constructed into a multi-type refrigeration system having a plurality of indoor units which are connected to each other in series or in parallel. In this case, it is possible to adopt a conventional method in which refrigerant is supplied to some<br><br>
or all of the plurality of indoor units. It is to be understood that the method falls within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Operations of refrigeration systems of air conditioning apparatuses with a bypass line connected between an inlet and an outlet of compressor, according to the first to fifth embodiments of the present invention will now be described.<br>
First, how the cooling and heating operations are performed by a refrigeration system according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, which performs a cooling operation. In the cooling operation shown in FIG. 2, the ON/OFF valve 94a of the first compressor line 94, the ON/OFF valve 95 a of the second compressor line 95 and the flow control valve 99b of the second compressor line 95 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 93a of the first refrigerant line 93 and the ON/OFF valve 96a of the second refrigerant line 96 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the indoor unit 20 while absorbing heat from air in the room, and is introduced into the compressor 30 through the first compressor line 94, The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 30, and introduced into the outdoor unit 40 through the second compressor line 95, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat outside the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the outdoor unit 40, and expanded through the expansion unit 10. The refrigerant is introduced into the indoor unit 20 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
In this cooling operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 30 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 99a mounted on the bypass line 99 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 99b mounted on the second compressor line 95 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 30 through the refrigerant bypass line 99, where the refrigerant is<br><br>
compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 30 is increased by the compressor 30, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is consequently increased.<br>
In particular, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is excessively low, the bypass valve 99a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 99 is fully opened while the flow control valve 99b mounted on the second compressor line 95 is fully closed, thereby enabling all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 to be supplied to the compressor 30 again.<br>
When a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is increased to a proper level, the bypass valve 99a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 99 is closed while the flow control valve 99b mounted on the second compressor line 95 is fully opened, thereby restoring the normal circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the first embodiment of the present invention, which performs a heating operation. In the heating operation shown in FIG. 3, the ON/OFF valve 93 a of the first refrigerant line 93, the ON/OFF valve 96a of the second refrigerant line 96 and the flow control valve 99b of the second compressor line 95 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 94a of the first compressor line 94 and the ON/OFF valve 95a of the second compressor line 95 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the outdoor unit 40 while absorbing heat from the outside air of the room, and is introduced into the compressor 30 through the second compressor line 95, the first refrigerant line 93 and the first compressor line 94. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 30, and introduced into the indoor unit 20 through the second refrigerant line 96, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat to the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the indoor unit 20, and expanded through the expansion unit 10. The refrigerant is introduced into the outdoor unit 40 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
In this heating operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged<br><br>
from the compressor 30 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 30 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 99a mounted on the bypass line 99 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 99b mounted on the second compressor line 95 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 30 through the refrigerant bypass line 99, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 30 is increased by the compressor 30, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is consequently increased.<br>
To sum up, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is lower than a normal level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 30 is lower than a normal level, due to various factors, a part of all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 30 is supplied to the compressor 30 again, to be further compressed, thereby causing the pressure of the refrigerant to reach the normal level.<br>
Next, how the cooling and heating operations are performed by a refrigeration system according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the second embodiment of the present invention, which performs a cooling operation. In the cooling operation shown in FIG. 6, the ON/OFF valve 194a of the first compressor line 194, the ON/OFF valve 195 a of the second compressor line 195 and the flow control valve 199b of the second compressor line 195 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 193a of the first refrigerant line 193 and the ON/OFF valve 196a of the second refrigerant line 196 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the indoor unit 120 while absorbing heat from air in the room, and is introduced into the compressor 130 through the first compressor line 194. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 130, and introduced into the outdoor unit 140 through the second<br><br>
compressor line 1955 where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat outside the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the outdoor unit 140, and expanded through the expansion unit 110. The refrigerant is introduced into the indoor unit 120 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 155a of the first bypass line 155 branched from the first line 154 located upstream of the expansion unit 110 is opened to an appropriate opening degree, while the flow control valve 165a of the second bypass line 165 branched from the second line 164 located downstream of the expansion unit 110 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 110 is introduced into the first auxiliary expansion unit 171 through the first bypass line 155, where the refrigerant is expanded. Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 150 through the refrigerant inlet 153a and refrigerant flowing to the expansion unit 110 from the outdoor unit 140 exchange heat with each other.<br>
At the same time, the ON/OFF valve 156a of the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 156 and the ON/OFF valve 193b of the first refrigerant line 193 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 166a of the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 166 is closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 153b of the first auxiliary evaporator 150 is introduced into the first compressor line 194 through the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 156, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 191 and the first refrigerant line 193, where the refrigerant is mixed with refrigerant discharged from the indoor unit 120, and the mixed refrigerant is supplied to the compressor 130.<br>
Since the flow control valve 165a of the second bypass line 165 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 110 is supplied to the indoor unit 120 through the second auxiliary evaporator 160 without any changes.<br>
In this cooling operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 130 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve<br><br>
199a mounted on the bypass line 199 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 199b mounted on the second compressor line 195 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 130 through the refrigerant bypass line 199, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 130 is increased by the compressor 130, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is consequently increased.<br>
In particular, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is excessively low, the bypass valve 199a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 199 is folly opened while the flow control valve 199b mounted on the second compressor line 195 is fully closed, thereby enabling all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 to be supplied to the compressor 130 again.<br>
When a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is increased to a proper level, the bypass valve 199a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 199 is closed while the flow control valve 199b mounted on the second compressor line 195 is folly opened, thereby restoring the normal circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the cooling operation, which is performed by the refrigeration system 100 according to the second embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25 °C discharged from the outdoor unit 140 passes through the first auxiliary evaporator 150 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 110. More specifically, a part, for example, 50% of the refrigerant discharged from the first auxiliary evaporator 150 passes through the first bypass line 155 and the first auxihary expansion unit 171 while being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 150, thereby allowing the refrigerant of-15°C to exchange heat with the refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the outdoor unit 140 in the first auxiliary evaporator 150. That is, by the heat exchange, the refrigerant discharged to the expansion unit 110<br><br>
from the first auxiliary evaporator 150 is cooled to 5°CS while the refrigerant discharged to the refrigerant outlet 153b of the first auxiliary evaporator 150 is warmed to 0°C,<br>
The refrigerant of 5°C introduced into the expansion unit 110 passes through the expansion unit 110 while being cooled to -15°C, and the refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure is introduced into the indoor unit 120, where the refrigerant is warmed to 10°C. Consequently, the refrigerant of 0DC discharged from the refrigerant outlet 153b of the first auxiliary evaporator 150 is mixed with the refrigerant of 10°C discharged from the indoor unit 120 in the compressor 130, thereby allowing a temperature of the mixed refrigerant in the compressor 130 to become 5°C which is a mean value between 0°C and 10°C.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the second embodiment of the present invention, which performs a heating operation. In the heating operation shown in FIG. 7, the flow control valve 199b of the second compressor line 195, the ON/OFF valve 193a of the first refrigerant line 193 and the ON/OFF valve 196a of the second refrigerant line 196 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 195a of the second compressor line 195 and the ON/OFF valve 194a of the first compressor line 194 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the outdoor unit 140 while absorbing heat from the outside air of the room, and is introduced into the compressor 130 through the first refrigerant line 198 and the first compressor line 194. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 130, and introduced into the indoor unit 120 through the second refrigerant line 196, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat to the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the indoor unit 120, and expanded through the expansion unit 110. The refrigerant is introduced into the outdoor unit 140 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 165a of the second bypass line 165 branched from the second line 164 located upstream of the expansion unit 110 is opened, while the flow control valve 155a of the first bypass line 155 branched<br><br>
from the first line 154 located downstream of the expansion unit 110 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 110 is introduced into the second auxiliary expansion unit 172 through the second bypass line 165, where the refrigerant is expanded. Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 160 through the refrigerant inlet 163a and refrigerant flowing to the expansion unit 110 from the indoor unit 120 exchange heat with each other.<br>
At the same time, the flow control valve 166a of the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 166 is opened, while the flow control valve 156a of the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 156 is closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 163b of the second auxiliary evaporator 160 is introduced into the first compressor line 194 through the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 166, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 191 and the first refrigerant line 193, where the refrigerant is mixed with refrigerant discharged from the outdoor unit 140, and the mixed refrigerant is supphed to the compressor 130.<br>
Since the flow control valve 155a of the first bypass line 155 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 110 is supplied to the outdoor unit 140 through the first auxiliary evaporator 150 without any changes.<br>
In this heating operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 130 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 199a mounted on the bypass line 199 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 199b mounted on the second compressor line 195 is reduced to a corresponding level Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 130 through the refrigerant bypass line 199, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 130 is increased by the compressor 130, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is consequently increased.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the heating operation, which<br><br>
is performed by the refrigeration system 100 according to the second embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the indoor unit 120 passes through the second auxiliary evaporator 160 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 110. More specifically, a part, for example, 50% of the refrigerant discharged from the second auxiliary evaporator 160 passes through the second bypass line 165 and the second auxiliary expansion unit 172 while being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 160, thereby allowing the refrigerant of -15°C to exchange heat with the refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the indoor unit 120 in the second auxiliary evaporator 160. That is, by the heat exchange, the refrigerant discharged to the expansion unit 110 from the second auxiliary evaporator 160 is cooled to 5°C, while the refrigerant discharged to the refrigerant outlet 163b of the second auxiliary evaporator 160 is warmed to 0°C.<br>
The refrigerant of 5°C introduced into the expansion unit 110 passing through the expansion unit 110 while being cooled to -15°C, and the refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure is introduced into the outdoor unit 140, where the refrigerant is warmed to 10°C. Consequently, the refrigerant of 0°C discharged from the refrigerant outlet 163b of the second auxiliary evaporator 160 is mixed with the refrigerant of 10°C discharged from the outdoor unit 140 in the compressor 130, thereby allowing a temperature of the mixed refrigerant in the compressor 130 to become 5°C which is a mean value between 0°C and 10°C.<br>
To sum up, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is lower than a normal level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 130 is lower than a normal level, due to various factors, a part of all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 is supplied to the compressor 130 again, to be further compressed, thereby causing the pressure of the refrigerant to reach the normal level. If it is required to prevent a temperature of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 130 from excessively rising, a part of<br><br>
the lower temperature-refrigerant is supplied to the inlet of the compressor 130.<br>
Next, how the cooling and heating operations are performed by a refrigeration system according to the third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 10 and 11.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the third embodiment of the present invention, which performs a coohng operation. In the cooling operation shown in FIG. 10, the ON/OFF valve 256a of the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 256, the ON/OFF valve 257a of the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 257, and the ON/OFF valve 296a and the flow control valve 299b of the second compressor line 295 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 296a of the refrigerant line 296, the ON/OFF valve 267a of the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 267 and the ON/OFF valve 266a of the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 266 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the indoor unit 220 while absorbing heat from air in the room, and is introduced into the compressor 230 through the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 256, the first temperature-refrigerant outflow line 257 and the first compressor line 294. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 230, and introduced into the outdoor unit 240 through the second compressor line 295, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat outside the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the outdoor unit 240, and expanded through the expansion unit 210. The refrigerant is introduced into the indoor unit 220 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 255a of the first bypass line 255 branched from the first line 254 located upstream of the expansion unit 210 is opened, while the flow control valve 265a of the second bypass line 265 branched from the second line 264 located downstream of the expansion unit 210 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 210 is introduced into the first auxiliary expansion unit 271 through   the   first   bypass   line   255,   where   the   refrigerant   is   expanded.<br><br>
Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 250 through the refrigerant inlets 253a and 253b and refrigerant flowing to the expansion unit 210 from the outdoor unit 240 exchange heat with each other. That is, higher temperature-refrigerant discharged from the indoor unit 220 is mixed with lower temperature-refrigerant discharged from the first auxiliary expansion unit 271, and the mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with refrigerant discharged from the outdoor unit 240 in the first auxiliary evaporator 250.<br>
Refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 253c of the first auxiliary evaporator 250 is introduced into the first compressor line 294 through the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 257, and thus supphed to the compressor 230.<br>
Since the flow control valve 265a of the second bypass line 265 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 210 is supplied to the indoor unit 220 through the second auxiliary evaporator 260 without any changes.<br>
In this cooling operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 230 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 299a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 299 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 299b mounted on the second compressor line 295 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 230 through the refrigerant bypass line 299, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 230 is increased by the compressor 230, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is consequently increased.<br>
In particular, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is excessively low, the bypass valve 299a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 299 is fully opened while the flow control valve 299b mounted on the second compressor line 295 is fully closed, thereby enabling all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 to be supplied to the<br><br>
compressor 230 again.<br>
When a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is increased to a proper level, the bypass valve 299a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 299 is closed while the flow control valve 299b mounted on the second compressor line 295 is fully opened, thereby restoring the normal circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the cooling operation, which is performed by the refrigeration system 200 according to the third embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25 °C discharged from the outdoor unit 240 passes through the first auxiliary evaporator 250 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 210. More specifically, a part, for example, 50% of the refrigerant discharged from the first auxiliary evaporator 250 passes through the first bypass line 255 and the first auxiliary expansion unit 271 while being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 250. The refrigerant of -15°C discharged from the first auxiliary evaporator 250 is introduced into the expansion unit 210, where the refrigerant is changed into a refrigerant in a state of lower temperature of -15°C and lower pressure. The refrigerant in a state of lower temperature of -15°C and lower pressure is introduced into the indoor unit 220, where the refrigerant is warmed to 10°C. The refrigerant of 10°C is introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 250 through the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 256, where the refrigerant is mixed with refrigerant introduced therein through the first auxiliary expansion unit 271. The mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with the refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the outdoor unit 240 in the first auxiliary evaporator 250. As a result, refrigerant of a predetermined temperature, for example, 5°C is introduced into the compressor 230 through the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 257, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 291 and first compressor line 294.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the third embodiment of the present invention, which performs a heating<br><br>
operation. In the heating operation shown in FIG. 11, the ON/OFF valve 266a of the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 266, the ON/OFF valve 267a of the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 267, the ON/OFF valve 296a of the refrigerant line 296 and the flow control valve 299b of the second compressor line 295 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 295a of the second compressor line 295, the ON/OFF valve 257a of the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 257 and the ON/OFF valve 256a of the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 256 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the outdoor unit 240 while absorbing heat from the outside air of the room, and is introduced into the compressor 230 through the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 266, the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 267 and the first compressor line 294. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 230, and introduced into the indoor unit 220 through the second compressor line 295, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat to the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the indoor unit 220, and expanded through the expansion unit 210. The refrigerant is introduced into the outdoor unit 240 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 265a of the second bypass line 265 branched from the second line 264 located upstream of the expansion unit 210 is opened, while the flow control valve 255a of the first bypass line 255 branched from the first line 254 located downstream of the expansion unit 210 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 210 is introduced into the second auxiliary expansion unit 272 through the second bypass line 265, where the refrigerant is expanded. Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 260 through the refrigerant inlets 263 a and 263b and refrigerant flowing to the expansion unit 210 from the indoor unit 220 exchange heat with each other. That is, the higher temperature-refrigerant discharged from the outdoor unit 240 and the refrigerant discharged from the second auxiliary expansion unit 272 are mixed, and the mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with the refrigerant discharged<br><br>
from the indoor unit 220 in the second auxiliary evaporator 260.<br>
The refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 263c of the second auxiliary evaporator 260 is introduced into the compressor 230 through the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 267 and the first compressor line 294.<br>
Since the flow control valve 255a of the first bypass line 255 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 210 is supplied to the outdoor unit 240 through the first auxiliary evaporator 250 without any changes.<br>
In this heating operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 230 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 299a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 299 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 299b mounted on the second compressor line 295 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 230 through the refrigerant bypass line 299, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 230 is increased by the compressor 230, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is consequently increased.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the heating operation, which is performed by the refrigeration system 200 according to the third embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the indoor unit 220 passes through the second auxiliary evaporator 260 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 210. More specifically, a part, for example, 50% of the refrigerant discharged from the second auxiliary evaporator 260 passes through the second bypass line 265 and the second auxiliary expansion unit 272 while being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 260. The refrigerant of-15°C discharged from the second auxiliary evaporator 260 is introduced into the expansion unit 210, where the refrigerant is changed into a<br><br>
refrigerant in a state of lower temperature of -15°C and lower pressure. The refrigerant in a state of lower temperature of -15°C and lower pressure is introduced into the outdoor unit 240, where the refrigerant is warmed to 10°C. The refrigerant of 10°C is introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 260 through the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 266, where the refrigerant is mixed with refrigerant introduced therein through the second auxiliary expansion unit 272. The mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with the refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the indoor unit 220 in the second auxiliary evaporator 260. As a result, refrigerant of a predetermined temperature, for example, 5°C is introduced into the compressor 230 through the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 267, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 291 and first compressor line 294.<br>
To sum up, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is lower than a normal level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 230 is lower than a normal level, due to various factors, a part of all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 is supplied to the compressor 230 again, to be further compressed, thereby causing the pressure of the refrigerant to reach the normal level. If it is required to prevent a temperature of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 230 from excessively rising, a part of the lower temperature-refrigerant is supplied to the inlet of the compressor 230.<br>
Next, how the cooling and heating operations are performed by a refrigeration system according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 14 and 15.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, which performs a cooling operation. In the cooling operation shown in FIG. 14, the ON/OFF valve 388a of the sixth connecting line 388, the ON/OFF valve 398a of the fifth connecting line 398, the ON/OFF valve 392a of the first connecting line 392 and the ON/OFF valve 395a and the flow control valve 399b of the second compressor line 395 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 389a of the fourth connecting line 389, the<br><br>
ON/OFF valve 393b of the seventh connecting line 393B, the ON/OFF valve 366a of the third connecting hne 396 and the ON/OFF valve 393a of the second connecting line 393A are closed.<br>
Consequently, refiigerant evaporates in the indoor unit 320 while absorbing heat from air in the room, and is introduced into the compressor 330 through the sixth connecting hne 388, the fifth connecting line 398, the first connecting line 302 and the first compressor line 394. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 330, and introduced into the outdoor unit 340 through the second compressor line 395, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat outside the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the outdoor unit 340, and expanded through the expansion unit 310. The refrigerant is introduced into the indoor unit 320 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 355a of the first bypass line 355 branched from the first line 354 located upstream of the expansion unit 310 is opened, while the flow control valve 365a of the second bypass line 365 branched from the second line 364 located downstream of the expansion unit 310 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 310 is introduced into the first auxiliary expansion unit 371 through the first bypass line 355, where the refrigerant is expanded. Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 350 through the refrigerant inlet 353a and refiigerant flowing to the expansion unit 310 from the outdoor unit 340 exchange heat with each other.<br>
The refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 353b of the first auxiliary evaporator 350 is introduced into the first connecting line 392 through the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 356, while refrigerant discharged from the indoor unit 320 is subjected to heat exchange through the expansion unit 310, and introduced into the first connecting line 392 through the fifth connecting line 398. The two refrigerants are mixed in the first connecting line 392, and the mixed refrigerant is supplied to the compressor 330 through the lower tempierature-refrigerant feeding line 391 and the first compressor line 394.<br><br>
Since the flow control valve 365a of the second bypass line 365 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 310 is supplied to the indoor unit 320 through the second auxiliary evaporator 360 without any changes.<br>
In this cooling operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 330 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 399a mounted on the bypass line 399 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 399b mounted on the second compressor line 395 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 330 through the refrigerant bypass line 399, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 330 is increased by the compressor 330, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is consequently increased.<br>
In particular, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is excessively low, the bypass valve 399a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 399 is fully opened while the flow control valve 399b mounted on the second compressor line 395 is fully closed, thereby enabhng all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 to be supplied to the compressor 330 again.<br>
When a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is increased to a proper level, the bypass valve 399a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 399 is closed while the flow control valve 399b mounted on the second compressor line 395 is fully opened, thereby restoring the normal circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the cooling operation, which is performed by the refrigeration system 300 according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25 °C discharged from the outdoor unit 340 passes through the first auxiliary evaporator 350 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 310.    More specifically, a part, for example,<br><br>
50% of the refrigerant discharged from the first auxiliary evaporator 350 passes through the first bypass line 355 and the first auxiliary expansion unit 371 while being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 350. The refrigerant of-15°C exchanges heat with the refrigerant of 25 °C discharged from the outdoor unit 340 in the first auxiliary evaporator 350. As a result, the refrigerant discharged from the first auxiliary evaporator 350 to the expansion unit 310 has a temperature of 5°C , and the refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 353b of the first auxiliary evaporator 350 has a temperature of 0°C.<br>
The refrigerant of 5°C introduced into the expansion unit 310 passes through the expansion unit 310 while being cooled to -15°C, and the refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure is introduced into the indoor unit 320, where the refrigerant is warmed to 10°C. The refrigerant, which is introduced into the expansion unit 310 from the indoor unit 320, is wanned to 15°C by heat exchange with the refrigerant expanded through the first auxiliary evaporator 350. Accordingly, since the refrigerant of 0°C discharged from the refrigerant outlet 353b of the first auxiliary evaporator 350 and the refrigerant of 15°C discharged from the indoor unit 320 through the expansion unit 310 are introduced into the compressor 330, the mixed refrigerant in the compressor 330 has a temperature between 0°C and 15°C, preferably about 5°C.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, which performs a heating operation. In the heating operation shown in FIG. 15, the ON/OFF valve 396a of the third connecting line 396, the ON/OFF valve 393b of the seventh connecting line 393B, the ON/OFF valve 303a of the second connecting line 303A, the ON/OFF valve 389a of the fourth connecting line 380 and the flow control valve 399b of the second compressor line 395 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 395a of the second compressor line 395, the ON/OFF valve 398a of the fifth connecting line 398, the ON/OFF valve 388a of the sixth connecting line 388 and the ON/OFF valve 392a of the first connecting line 392 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the outdoor unit 340 while<br><br>
absorbing heat from the outside air of the room, and is introduced into the compressor 330 through the third connecting line 396, the seventh connecting line 393B, the second connecting line 393A, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 391 and the first compressor line 394. The refiigerant is discharged from the compressor 330, and introduced into the indoor unit 320 through the fourth connecting line 389, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat to the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the indoor unit 320, and expanded through the expansion unit 310. The refiigerant is introduced into the outdoor unit 340 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 365a of the second bypass line 365 branched from the second line 364 located upstream of the expansion unit 310 is opened, while the flow control valve 355a of the first bypass line 355 branched from the first line 354 located downstream of the expansion unit 310 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 310 is introduced into the second auxiliary expansion unit 372 through the second bypass line 365, where the refrigerant is expanded. Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 360 through the refrigerant inlet 363a and refrigerant flowing to the expansion unit 310 from the indoor unit 320 exchange heat with each other.<br>
The refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 363b of the second auxiliary evaporator 360 is introduced into the second connecting line 393A through the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 366, while refrigerant discharged from the outdoor unit 340 is subjected to heat exchange through the expansion unit 310, and introduced into the second connecting line 393A through the sixth connecting line 388, The two refrigerants are mixed in the second connecting line 393A, and the mixed refrigerant is supphed to the compressor 330 through the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 391 and the first compressor line 394.<br>
Since the flow control valve 355a of the first bypass line 355 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 310 is supplied to the outdoor unit 340 through the first auxiliary evaporator 350 without any changes.<br><br>
In this heating operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 330 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 399a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 399 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 399b mounted on the second compressor line 395 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 330 through the refrigerant bypass line 399, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 330 is increased by the compressor 330, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is consequently increased.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the heating operation, which is performed by the refrigeration system 300 according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the indoor unit 320 passes through the second auxiliary evaporator 360 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 310. More specifically, a part, for example, 50% of the refrigerant discharged from the second auxiliary evaporator 360 passes through the second bypass line 365 and the second auxiliary expansion unit 372 while being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 360. The refrigerant of -15°C exchanges heat with the refrigerant of 25 °C discharged from the indoor unit 320 in the second auxiliary evaporator 360. As a result, the refrigerant discharged from the second auxiliary evaporator 360 to the expansion unit 310 has a temperature of 5°C , and the refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 363b of the second auxiliary evaporator 360 has a temperature ofO°C.<br>
The refrigerant of 5°C introduced into the expansion unit 310 passes through the expansion unit 310 while being cooled to -15°C, and the refrigerant in a state of lower temperature and lower pressure is introduced into the outdoor unit 340, where the refrigerant is warmed to  10°C.    The refrigerant, which is<br><br>
introduced into the expansion unit 310 from the outdoor unit 340, is warmed to 15°C by heat exchange with the refrigerant expanded through the second auxiliary evaporator 360. Accordingly, since the refrigerant of 0°C discharged from the refiigerant outlet 363b of the second auxiliary evaporator 360 and the refrigerant of 15°C discharged from the outdoor unit 340 through the expansion unit 310 are introduced into the compressor 330, the mixed refrigerant in the compressor 330 has a temperature between 0°C and 15°C, preferably about 5°C.<br>
To sum up, according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is lower than a normal level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 330 is lower than a normal level, due to various factors, a part of all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 330 is supplied to the compressor 330 again, to be further compressed, thereby causing the pressure of the refrigerant to reach the normal level. If it is required to prevent a temperature of the refiigerant discharged from the compressor 330 from excessively rising, a part of the lower temperature-refrigerant is supplied to the inlet of the compressor 330.<br>
Next, how the cooling and heating operations are performed by a refrigeration system according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 18 and 19.<br>
Referring to FIG. 18, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, which performs a cooling operation, hi the cooling operation shown in FIG. 18, the ON/OFF valve 493a of the second connecting line 493, the ON/OFF valve 456a of the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 456, the ON/OFF valve 457a of the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 457, and the ON/OFF valve 495a and the flow control valve 499b of the second compressor line 495 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 466a of the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 466, the ON/OFF valve 492a of the first connecting line 492, the ON/OFF valve 467a of the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 467 and the ON/OFF valve 496a of the third connecting line 496 are closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the indoor unit 420 while<br><br>
absorbing heat from air in the room, and is introduced into the compressor 430 through the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 456, the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 457, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 491 and the first compressor line 494. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 430, and introduced into the outdoor unit 440 through the second compressor line 495, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat outside the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the outdoor unit 440, and expanded through the expansion unit 410. The refrigerant is introduced into the indoor unit 420 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 455a of the first bypass line 455 branched from the first line 454 located upstream of the expansion unit 410 is opened, while the flow control valve 465a of the second bypass line 465 branched from the second line 464 located downstream of the expansion unit 410 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 410 is introduced into the first auxiliary expansion unit 471 through the first bypass line 455, where the refrigerant is expanded. Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 450 through the refrigerant inlets 453a and 453b and refrigerant flowing to the expansion unit 410 from the outdoor unit 440 exchange heat with each other. The higher temperature-refrigerant, which is discharged from the indoor unit 420 and heat-exchanged through the expansion unit 410, and the lower temperature-refrigerant discharged from the first auxiliary expansion unit 471 are mixed, and the mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with the refrigerant discharged from the outdoor unit 440 in the first auxiliary expansion unit 450.<br>
The refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 453c of the first auxiliary evaporator 450 is introduced into the first compressor line 494 through the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 457, thereby allowing the refrigerant to be supplied to the compressor 430.<br>
Since the flow control valve 465a of the second bypass line 465 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 410 is supplied to the<br><br>
indoor unit 420 through the second auxiliary evaporator 460 without any changes.<br>
In this cooling operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 430 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 499a mounted on the bypass line 499 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 499b mounted on the second compressor line 495 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 430 through the refrigerant bypass line 499, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 430 is increased by the compressor 430, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is consequently increased.<br>
In particular, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is excessively low, the bypass valve 499a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 499 is fully opened while the flow control valve 499b mounted on the second compressor line 495 is fully closed, thereby enabling all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 to be supplied to the compressor 430 again.<br>
When a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is increased to a proper level, the bypass valve 499a mounted on the refrigerant bypass line 499 is closed while the flow control valve 499b mounted on the second compressor line 495 is fully opened, thereby restoring the normal circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the cooling operation, which is performed by the refrigeration system 400 according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25 °C discharged from the outdoor unit 440 passes through the first auxiliary evaporator 450 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 410. More specifically, a part, for example, 50% of the refrigerant discharged from the first auxiliary evaporator 450 passes through the first bypass line 455 and the first auxiliary expansion unit 471 while<br><br>
being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 450. The refrigerant is introduced into the expansion unit 410, and passes through the expansion unit 410, resulting in refrigerant in a state of lower temperature of -15°C and lower pressure. The refrigerant is introduced into the indoor unit 420, where the refrigerant is warmed to 10°C. The refrigerant of 10°C is introduced into expansion unit 410 through the second connecting Une 493, where the refrigerant is further warmed to 15°C. The refrigerant is introduced into the first auxiliary evaporator 450 through the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 456, where the refrigerant is mixed with refrigerant introduced thereinto the first auxiliary evaporator 471. As a result, since the mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with the refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the outdoor unit 440 in the first auxiliary evaporator 450, refrigerant of a predetermined temperature, preferably 5°C is introduced into the compressor 430 through the first lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 457, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 491 and the first compressor line 494.<br>
Referring to FIG. 19, there is shown the refrigeration system according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, which performs a heating operation. In the heating operation shown in FIG. 19, the ON/OFF valve 492a of the first connecting line 492, the ON/OFF valve 466a of the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 466, the ON/OFF valve 467a of the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 467, the flow control valve 499b of the second compressor line 495 and the ON/OFF valve 496a of the third connecting line 496 are opened, while the ON/OFF valve 495a of the second compressor Une 495, the ON/OFF valve 456a of the first higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 456, the ON/OFF valve 493a of the second connecting line 493 and the ON/OFF valve 457a of the lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 457 are<br>
closed.<br>
Consequently, refrigerant evaporates in the outdoor unit 440 while absorbing heat from the outside air of the room, and is introduced into the compressor 430 through the first connecting line 492, the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 466, the second lower temperature-refrigerant<br><br>
outflow line 467, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 491 and the first compressor line 494. The refrigerant is discharged from the compressor 430, and introduced into the indoor unit 420 through the third connecting line 496, where the refrigerant is condensed while radiating heat to the room. The refrigerant is discharged from the indoor unit 420, and expanded through the expansion unit 410. The refrigerant is introduced into the outdoor unit 440 again, thereby accomplishing a circulation cycle of refrigerant.<br>
At this point, the flow control valve 465a of the second bypass line 465 branched from the second line 464 located upstream of the expansion unit 410 is opened, while the flow control valve 455a of the first bypass line 455 branched from the first line 454 located downstream of the expansion unit 410 is closed.<br>
Consequently, a part of the refrigerant to be introduced into the expansion unit 410 is introduced into the second auxiliary expansion unit 472 through the second bypass line 465, where the refrigerant is expanded. Accordingly, refrigerant introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 460 through the refrigerant inlets 463a and 463b and refrigerant flowing to the expansion unit 410 from the indoor unit 420 exchange heat with each other. That is, the higher temperature-refrigerant, which is discharged from the outdoor unit 440 and heat-exchanged through the expansion unit 410, and the lower temperature-refrigerant discharged from the second auxiliary expansion unit 472 are mixed, and the mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with the refrigerant discharged from the indoor unit 420 in the second auxiliary expansion unit 460.<br>
The refrigerant discharged from the refrigerant outlet 463 c of the second auxiliary evaporator 460 is introduced into the first compressor line 494 through the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 467, thereby allowing the refrigerant to be supplied to the compressor 430.<br>
Since the flow control valve 455a of the first bypass line 455 is closed, refrigerant discharged from the expansion unit 410 is supplied to the outdoor unit 440 through the first auxiliary evaporator 450 without any changes.<br>
In this heating operation, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is lower than a preset level, or when an outside<br><br>
temperature of the compressor 430 is lower than a preset level, the bypass valve 499a mounted on the refiigerant bypass line 499 is opened to an appropriate opening degree while an opening degree of the flow control valve 499b mounted on the second compressor line 495 is reduced to a corresponding level. Consequently, a part of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is bypassed to the inlet of the compressor 430 through the refrigerant bypass line 499, where the refrigerant is compressed again. Accordingly, since a pressure of refrigerant supplied to the compressor 430 is increased by the compressor 430, a pressure of refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is consequently increased.<br>
An example of the state of the refrigerant in the heating operation, which is performed by the refrigeration system 400 according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, will now be described.<br>
Refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the indoor unit 420 passes through the second auxiliary evaporator 460 while being cooled to 5°C, and is introduced into the expansion unit 410. More specifically, a part, for example, 50% of the refrigerant discharged from the second auxiliary evaporator 460 passes through the second bypass line 465 and the second auxiliary expansion unit 472 while being cooled to -15°C, and is introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 460. The refrigerant is introduced into the expansion unit 410, and passes through the expansion unit 410, resulting in refrigerant in a state of lower temperature of -15°C and lower pressure. The refrigerant is introduced into the outdoor unit 440, where the refrigerant is warmed to 10°C. The refrigerant of 10°C is introduced into expansion unit 410 through the second connecting line 492, where the refrigerant is further warmed to 15°C. The refrigerant is introduced into the second auxiliary evaporator 460 through the second higher temperature-refrigerant inflow line 466, where the refrigerant is mixed with refrigerant introduced thereinto the second auxiliary evaporator 472. As a result, since the mixed refrigerant exchanges heat with the refrigerant of 25°C discharged from the indoor unit 420 in the second auxiliary evaporator 460, refrigerant of a predetermined temperature, preferably 5°C is introduced into the compressor 430<br><br>
through the second lower temperature-refrigerant outflow line 467, the lower temperature-refrigerant feeding line 491 and the first compressor line 494.<br>
To sum up, according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention, when a pressure of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is lower than a normal level, or when an outside temperature of the compressor 430 is lower than a normal level, due to various factors, a part of all of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 is supplied to the compressor 430 again, to be further compressed, thereby causing the pressure of the refrigerant to reach the normal level. If it is required to prevent a temperature of the refrigerant discharged from the compressor 430 from excessively rising, a part of the lower temperature-refrigerant is supplied to the inlet of the compressor 430.<br>
