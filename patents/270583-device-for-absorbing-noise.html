				<td>Description<br>
Device for Absorbing Noise<br>
The invention relates to a device for absorbing electrical noise on cables.<br>
It is known that the propagation of interfering electrical signals, which are<br>
also termed "noise," in cables may be prevented by routing the cables<br>
through either a fully closed, or a nearly fully closed, ring fabricated from for<br>
example ferromagnetic material. In order to also be able to subsequently<br>
route existing cables through such rings, devices where a pair of half-rings<br>
fabricated from ferromagnetic are incorporated in a split-shell housing are<br>
known. This housing is then closed around a cable, yielding a closed<br>
magnetic ring, or a ring having a narrow air gap. In order to be able to<br>
fasten such devices to the cable, the housings have a fixing means. It<br>
should be prevented that the housing containing the ferromagnetic material<br>
slides along the cable. For example, it is known to form teeth that grip the<br>
cable on an aperture, through which the cable is channelled. In a known<br>
device of this type (cf. EP 257179), several such teeth are configured in<br>
each aperture.<br>
It is also known to insert the cable in a slot between two edges and to<br>
clamp it in place (cf. DE 19912917).<br>
Devices of this type are frequently attached to cables with various<br>
diameters. However, there is also the problem that cables with the same<br>
gauge may have differing flexibilities. This applies for example when cables<br>
have heavy-gauge, wire cores. In this case, they are less flexible than<br>
cables with numerous, thin, wire cores.<br>
The invention is based on the task of designing a device for absorbing<br>
electrical noise in cables which can be securely attached to various types of<br>
cables.<br>
In order to solve this task, the invention proposes a device with the features<br>
mentioned in claim 1. Further developments of the invention are subject of<br>
the subsidiary claims.<br>
The device thus comprises a housing, in which the ferromagnetic material<br>
is accommodated. The housing can be a split-shell housing similar to those<br>
known from the state of the art. However, the invention is also applicable to<br>
housings that are not configured in the form of a pair of half-shells, and<br>
where cables must, for example, be channelled through them. The<br>
deformation of the fixation means along the length of the cable makes it<br>
possible to accommodate very stiff or very thick cables in order to develop,<br>
sufficient reactive forces through deformation which serves for fixation. The<br>
stiffer a cable is, the more space is also available on the end walls, since<br>
the cable cannot be bent there.<br>
In further development of the invention, it can be provided that the fixation<br>
means is designed deformable in the direction transverse to the cable. An<br>
additional possibility for accommodating cables having differing flexibilities<br>
and/or gauges.<br>
In further development of the invention, it can be provided that the fixation<br>
means has a pair of fixing edges forming a slot, between which the cable<br>
may be fixed. This can be accomplished wither by pressing the cables into<br>
the slot from the side and then fixed in this manner. Due to the longitudinal<br>
deformation it is however also possible that the cable is slid through the<br>
fixation means from one side, which then also leads to deformation of the<br>
fixation means.<br>
In further development of the invention, it can also be provided that the<br>
fixing edges are formed on trips which run roughly parallel to the ends of<br>
the housing. The strips can be flat plate-like components. These are<br>
connected to the ends of the housing at certain locations.<br>
For example, in further development of the invention, it can be provided<br>
that the strips have L-shaped cross-sections, whereby one leg is parallel to<br>
the end of the housing and comprises the fixing edge.<br>
The other leg is preferably an integral part of the end wall of the housing.<br>
In the case of a slot open on one side, it can be provided according to the<br>
invention that the outer ends of the fixing edges diverge from one another,<br>
proceeding toward the free end of the slot.<br>
It can be provided that the fixing edges are parallel to one another in the<br>
vicinity of a closed end of the slot.<br>
According to the invention, it can be provided that fixation means which are<br>
preferably identical to the other fixation means are provided on the opposite<br>
end of the housing.<br>
Other features, details, and advantages of the invention are evident from<br>
the claims and the abstract, both of whose wordings are herewith made an<br>
integral part of this description by way of reference thereto, the following<br>
descriptions of preferred embodiments of the invention, and the drawings,<br>
which depict:<br>
Fig. 1: an end view of an opened housing;<br>
Fig. 2: a view of the opened housing from the closed side of both<br>
housing shells;<br>
Fig. 3: a top view of the opened housing shown in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 4: a side view of the closed housing, without cable;<br>
Fig. 5: a schematised, top view of the housing fixed onto a heavy-<br>
gauge cable.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts an end view of an opened housing of a device for absorbing<br>
electrical noise in cables. The housing comprises a pair of half-shells 1 that<br>
are roughly trough formed and each end 2 of which has a roughly<br>
semicircular notch 3. The pair of half-shells 1 are joined together by a foil<br>
hinge 4 formed in the vicinities of their long edges. On the outer edge of<br>
one half-shell opposite the foil hinge 4, there is a protrusion 5 with teeth<br>
that latch the half-shells 1 in place in the closed position.<br>
A fixation means 6 that, in particular, is injection-moulded onto the plastic of<br>
the housing, is configured in the vicinity of the end 2 of the left-hand<br>
housing shell visible in Fig. 1. The fixation means 6 comprises two strips 7<br>
that have planar, front surfaces running parallel to the end 2 of the<br>
associated housing half-shell 1. Both strips have a gap between them<br>
forming a slot 8. The inner surfaces of the strips 7 form fixing edges 9. In<br>
the lower area of Fig. 1 where the end of the slot 8 formed by the contour of<br>
the semicircular notch 3 in the end 2 of the housing is situated, the fixing<br>
edges run parallel to one another. The fixing edges diverge in order to form<br>
an insertion channel in the vicinity of the end of the slot 8 where it is open.<br>
An identical fixation means 6 is arranged on the opposite end of the second<br>
housing half-shell 1, on the right in Fig. 1. In this case, the rear surfaces 10<br>
of the strips 7, which form a step are shown, since they have a distance<br>
from the ends 2 of the housing half-shells 1.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts a view of the housing half-shells from below in Fig. 1. It can<br>
be seen that a pair of foil hinges 4 separated by a distance are present. It<br>
can also be seen that the strips 7 have L-shaped cross-sections, or are<br>
L-shaped when viewed from below, whereby one leg of each strip 7 runs<br>
parallel to the end 2 of the housing. The second leg serves to join the first<br>
leg with the end 2 of the housing in a single piece. As can also be seen<br>
from Fig. 2, exertion of a longitudinal stress, i.e., a stress acting from<br>
bottom to top in Fig. 2, allows the fixing edges 9 to move upward, due to<br>
deformation of the strips 7.<br>
Turning to Fig. 3. This shows the arrangement of Fig. 1, as viewed from<br>
above in Fig. 1. Here it can be seen that the rear surfaces 10 of the strips 7<br>
are a distance away from the surfaces of the ends 2 and that the notches,<br>
or incisions 11, that allow the strips 7 to deform longitudinally along the<br>
length of the cable are present between the strips and the ends 2 of the<br>
housing half-shells.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a side view of the closed housing, without inserted cable.<br>
Also in this view, an incision 12 is present between the strips 7 and the<br>
ends 2 of the housing half-shells 1 in order to reduce the height of the legs<br>
connecting the strips 7 with the housing. This also contributes to arranging<br>
the strips 7, which is configured in the form of plate-like components, so<br>
that it can be deformed by deforming the connection elements in such a<br>
manner that the fixing edges 9 can move in the axial direction. "Axial<br>
direction" is defined as along the axis linking the semicircular notches 3 on<br>
either end of a housing half-shell.<br>
The result of attaching such a housing to a cable 13 is depicted in Fig. 5. It<br>
is assumed that the cable involved is a relatively heavy-gauge cable whose<br>
diameter is significantly larger than the distance between the two fixing<br>
edges 9 at their parallel sections. This causes the strips 7 to pivot away<br>
from the ends 2 of the housing half-shells in order to widen the slot 8.<br>
Simultaneously, the effect occurs that the corners of the fixing edges 9 form<br>
sharp edges that grip the insulating material of the cable 13. As can be<br>
seen from Fig. 5, this type of deformation also allows clamping stiff, heavy-<br>
gauge cables 13 while thin or flexible cables lead to less deformation of the<br>
strips 7.<br>
