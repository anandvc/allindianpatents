				<td>DROPLET DEPOSITION APPARATUS<br>
The present invention relates to droplet deposition apparatus, such as, for example,<br>
a drop-on-demand inkjet printer.<br>
In order to increase the speed of inkjet printing, inkjet printheads are typically<br>
provided with an increasing number of ink ejection channels. For example, there are<br>
commercially available inkjet printheads having in excess of 500 ink ejection channels,<br>
and is anticipated that in future so called "pagewide printers" could include printheads<br>
containing in excess of 2000 ink ejection channels.<br>
In at least its preferred embodiments, the present invention seeks to provide droplet<br>
deposition apparatus suitable for use in a pagewide printer and having a relatively simple<br>
and compact structure.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a droplet deposition apparatus<br>
comprising : at least one droplet ejection unit comprising a plurality of fluid channels<br>
disposed side by side in a row extending in a first direction, an actuator, and a plurality of<br>
nozzles, each having a nozzle axis extending in a second direction orthogonal to the first<br>
direction, said actuator being actuable to eject a droplet of fluid from a fluid channel<br>
through a respective nozzle, said ejection unit having an end face extending in both said<br>
first and second directions; a support member for said at least one droplet ejection unit;<br>
and a conduit for conveying droplet fluid to each of the fluid channels of said at least one<br>
droplet ejection unit; and wherein interconnect means, for electrically connecting said<br>
actuator means to drive circuit means, are formed on said end face.<br>
Where the apparatus comprises a plurality of droplet ejection units, the first conduit<br>
is preferably configured to convey droplet fluid to each of the fluid channels of<br>
said plurality of droplet ejection units. Thus, all of the ink channels<br><br>
can be supplied with ink from one conduit. This can reduce significantly the<br>
number of ink supply channels or conduits required to convey ink to the ink<br>
channels, thereby simplifying machining and providing a compact droplet<br>
deposition apparatus.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises a second conduit for conveying droplet<br>
fluid away from each of the fluid channels of said at least one droplet ejection<br>
unit.<br>
In one embodiment, there are a plurality of rows of channels, the droplet<br>
ejection units being arranged on the support member such that at least some<br>
of the fluid channels of adjacent rows of fluid channels are substantially co-<br>
axial. Thus, there may be effectively one fluid inlet and one fluid outlet for a<br>
number of coaxial ink channels. This can reduce significantly the size of the<br>
printhead in the direction of the paper feed. This can also allow the printheads<br>
to be closely stacked in the direction of paper feed, which is advantageous in<br>
achieving accurate drop placement, a compact printer and hence a lower cost.<br>
In a preferred arrangement, each fluid channel has a length extending in a first<br>
direction and said at least one row extends in a second direction substantially<br>
orthogonal to said first direction. With such an arrangement, preferably the at<br>
least one droplet ejection unit is arranged on the support member such that<br>
there is at least one row of fluid channels extending in the second direction.<br>
The increased density of the components of the apparatus, such as the drive<br>
circuitry, can lead to problems associated with overheating. Therefore,<br>
preferably at least one of the conduits is arranged so as to transfer a<br>
substantial part of the heat generated during droplet ejection to droplet fluid<br>
conveyed thereby.<br>
The apparatus may include drive circuit means for supplying electrical signals<br>
to the actuator means. The drive circuit means may be in substantial thermal<br><br>
contact with at least one of the conduits so as to transfer a substantial part of<br>
the heat generated in the drive circuit means to the droplet fluid. Arranging the<br>
drive circuit means in such a manner can conveniently allow the ink in the<br>
printhead to serve as the sink for the heat generated in the drive circuitry.<br>
This can substantially reduce the likelihood of overheating, whilst avoiding the<br>
problems with electrical integrity that might occur were the integrated circuit<br>
packaging containing the circuitry allowed to come into direct contact with the<br>
ink. In one arrangement the drive circuit means is mounted on the support<br>
member, the support member being in thermal contact with at least one of the<br>
conduits. In one embodiment, the support member comprises a substantially<br>
U-shaped, or H-shaped, member, the drive circuit means being mounted on<br>
at least one of the two facing sides of the arms of the U-shaped, or H shaped,<br>
member. With this arrangement, the drive circuit means can be readily<br>
physically isolated from the fluid conveyed by the conduits.<br>
Alternatively, the drive circuit means may be mounted on the support member<br>
so as to contact droplet fluid being conveyed by at least one of the conduits.<br>
With this arrangement it may be necessary to electrically passivate the<br>
external surfaces of the drive circuit means.<br>
In one embodiment the apparatus comprises a coolant conveying conduit for<br>
conveying a coolant fluid, the drive circuit means being proximate the coolant<br>
conveying conduit so as to transfer a substantial part of the heat generated in<br>
the drive circuit means to the coolant fluid. Cooling of the drive circuit can<br>
thus be achieved with reduced transfer of heat to the droplet ejection units.<br>
This can reduce any variation in droplet ejection velocity due to fluctuations in<br>
the viscosity of the fluid caused by heating of the droplet fluid by the drive<br>
circuit. The drive circuit means is preferably mounted on the support member,<br>
the support member being in thermal contact with the third conduit. Preferably,<br>
the third conduit comprises an aperture formed in the support member.<br>
Thus, in another aspect the present invention provides droplet deposition<br><br>
apparatus comprising:<br>
at least one droplet ejection unit comprising a plurality of fluid channels<br>
disposed side by side in a row, actuator means, drive circuit means for<br>
supplying actuating electrical signals to said actuator means, and a plurality<br>
of nozzles, said actuator means being actuable to eject a droplet of fluid from<br>
a fluid channel through a respective nozzle;<br>
droplet fluid conveying means for conveying droplet fluid to each of the<br>
fluid channels of said at least one droplet ejection unit; and<br>
further coolant conveying means for conveying a coolant fluid, at least<br>
one of said drive circuit means and said at least one droplet ejection unit being<br>
proximate said coolant conveying means so as to transfer a substantial part<br>
of the heat generated during droplet ejection to said coolant fluid.<br>
Preferably at least one of said at least one droplet ejection unit and said drive<br>
circuit means is mounted on said coolant conveying means. More preferably,<br>
both said at least one droplet ejection unit and said drive circuit means are<br>
mounted thereon.<br>
Preferably, the fluid conveying means comprises a conduit extending along<br>
said row and to one side of both said coolant conveying means and said at<br>
least one droplet ejection unit for conveying droplet fluid to each of the fluid<br>
channels of said at least one droplet ejection unit. The fluid conveying means<br>
preferably also comprises a second conduit extending along said row and to<br>
the other side of both said coolant conveying means and said at least one<br>
droplet ejection unit for receiving droplet fluid from each of the fluid channels<br>
of said at least one droplet ejection unit.<br>
In an alternative arrangement, there are two rows of fluid channels, each row<br>
being arranged on a respective support member having a respective conduit<br>
for conveying fluid to that row. Preferably, a further conduit is arranged to<br>
convey droplet fluid away from both rows of fluid channels. The second<br>
conduit preferably extends between the support members.<br><br>
In one arrangement, the at least one row extends in a first direction and the<br>
channels have a length extending in a second direction substantially coplanar<br>
with and orthogonal to the first direction, the support member having a<br>
dimension in said second direction which is substantially equal to n x the<br>
length of a fluid channel in the second direction, where n is the number of<br>
rows of channels. By reducing the width of the apparatus in the direction of<br>
the paper feed, by forming the support member with a thickness substantially<br>
equal to the combined lengths of the ink channels in the second direction,<br>
improvements in paper/printhead alignment and dot registration can be<br>
provided. PZT, from which the ejection units are typically formed, is relatively<br>
expensive and so it is advantageous to ensure that a maximum number of<br>
channels are provided for a minimum amount of PZT.<br>
Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention provides droplet deposition<br>
apparatus comprising:<br>
at least one droplet ejection unit comprising a plurality of fluid channels<br>
disposed side by side in a row extending in a first direction, said channels<br>
having a length extending in a second direction substantially coplanar with and<br>
orthogonal to said first direction, actuator means, and a plurality of nozzles,<br>
each nozzle having a nozzle axis extending in a third direction substantially<br>
orthogonal to said first and second directions, said actuator means being<br>
actuable to eject a droplet of fluid from a fluid channel through a respective<br>
nozzle;<br>
means for conveying droplet fluid to said fluid channels; and<br>
a support member for said at least one droplet ejection unit, said at<br>
least one droplet ejection unit being arranged on said support member such<br>
that there are n rows of fluid channels extending in said first direction (n being<br>
an integral number), said support member having a dimension in said second<br>
direction which is substantially equal to n x the length of a fluid channel in said<br>
second direction.<br>
In an alternative arrangement, the support member may comprise an arm of<br><br>
a substantially U-shaped member, at least one droplet ejection unit being<br>
supported at the end of each of the arms of the U-shaped member.<br>
Preferably, the second conduit extends between the arms of the U-shaped<br>
member to convey droplet fluid from the droplet ejection units supported by the<br>
arms of the U-shaped member. With such an arrangement, the apparatus may<br>
comprise a pair of conduits each for conveying droplet fluid to the or each<br>
droplet ejection unit supported by a respective arm, each conduit extending<br>
along the external side of the respective arm of the U-shaped member.<br>
In another arrangement, the apparatus comprises a cover member extending<br>
over and to the sides of the support member to define with the support<br>
member at least part of the conduits.<br>
The support member and the cover member may be attached to a base which<br>
defines with the support member and the cover member the conduits. Thus,<br>
the number of apparatus components may be reduced, since, for example, the<br>
base, cover member and support member perform multiple functions (including<br>
the definition of conduits).<br>
In yet another aspect the present invention provides droplet deposition<br>
apparatus comprising:<br>
a support member;<br>
at least one droplet ejection unit attached to said support member and<br>
comprising a plurality of fluid channels disposed side by side in a row; and<br>
a cover member extending over and to the sides of said support<br>
member to define with said support member a first conduit extending along<br>
said row for conveying fluid to said fluid channels and a second conduit<br>
extending along said row for conveying fluid from said fluid channels.<br>
The or each droplet ejection unit may comprise actuator means and a plurality<br>
of nozzles, the actuator means being actuable to eject a droplet of fluid from<br><br>
a fluid channel through a respective nozzle.<br>
The cover may include apertures for enabling droplets to be ejected from the<br>
fluid channels. These apertures are preferably etched in the cover member.<br>
In one arrangement the nozzles are formed in the cover. In another<br>
arrangement the nozzles are formed in a nozzle plate supported by the cover,<br>
each fluid channel being in fluid communication with a respective nozzle via<br>
a respective aperture. The use of both a cover member and nozzle plate can<br>
provided enhanced tolerance for the laser ablation of the nozzles in the nozzle<br>
plate, as precise positioning of the nozzle relative to the ink chamber can<br>
become less critical. As the nozzle plate is supported by the cover, it can be<br>
made thinner, thereby reducing costs. The cover is preferably formed from a<br>
material having a coefficient of thermal expansion which is substantially equal<br>
to that of the support member.<br>
The cover is preferably formed from metallic material, for example, from<br>
molybdenum or Nilo (a nickel/iron alloy).<br>
The or each droplet ejection unit may comprise a first piezoelectric layer poled<br>
in a first poling direction, and a second piezoelectric layer on said first<br>
piezoelectric layer and poled in a direction opposite to said first poling<br>
direction, said fluid channels being formed in said first and second<br>
piezoelectric layers. Thus, the walls of the fluid channels can serve as wall<br>
actuators of the so called "chevron" type. These actuators are known to be<br>
advantageous because they require a lower actuating voltage to establish the<br>
same pressure in the fluid channels during operation than comparable shear mode cantilever type actuators or other conventional piezoelectric drop on<br>
demand actuators.<br>
The first piezoelectric layer may be attached directly to said support member.<br>
This simple arrangement of the ejection unit can enable the channels to be<br>
machined in the first and second piezoelectric layers when the layers are in<br><br>
situ on the support member, thereby simplifying production. In this<br>
arrangement, the support member is preferably formed from ceramic material.<br>
In alternative arrangement, the first piezoelectric layer is formed on a base<br>
layer formed from ceramic material, said base layer being attached to said<br>
support member.<br>
The axes of the nozzles may extend in a direction substantially orthogonal to<br>
the direction of extension of said at least one row. In other words, the droplet<br>
ejection unit may be an "edge shooter", with droplets being ejected from the<br>
top of the ink channel.<br>

The present invention relates to droplet deposition apparatus, such as, for<br>
example, drop-on-demand inkjet printheads. In the preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention to be described below, the printhead employs a modular<br>
layout of droplet ejection modules to provide a pagewide array of droplet<br>
ejection nozzles for the ejection of fluid on to a substrate. The manufacture<br>
of such a droplet ejection module will first be described.<br>
With reference first to Figures 1 and 2, a droplet ejection module 100<br>
comprises a ceramic base wafer 102 on to which are attached first<br>
piezoelectric wafer 104 and second piezoelectric wafer 106. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the base wafer 102 is formed from a glass ceramic wafer having<br>
a thermal expansion coefficient CTE between that of the material from which<br>
the piezoelectric layers 104, 106 are formed (for example, PZT) and the<br>
material from which a support member on to which the base wafer 102 is to<br>
be attached are formed. The first piezoelectric wafer 104 is attached to the<br><br>
base wafer 102 by resilient glue bond material 108. Similarly, the second<br>
piezoelectric wafer 106 is attached to the first piezoelectric wafer 104 by<br>
resilient glue bond material 110. The combination of the CTE of the base wafer<br>
102 and the resilience of the glue bond material 108, 110 provides a buffer for<br>
avoiding the distortion of the module 100 that might otherwise occur as a result<br>
of the differing thermal expansion characteristics of the piezoelectric material<br>
and the support member. In this preferred embodiment, this is particularly<br>
important due to the compactness of the droplet ejection unit, as described in<br>
more detail below.<br>
A row of parallel fluid channels 112 are formed in the piezoelectric layers 104,<br>
106. For example, the fluid channels may be provided by grooves formed in<br>
the piezoelectric wafers using a narrow dicing blade. As indicated by arrows<br>
114 and 116 in Figure 2, the piezoelectric wafers are poled in opposite<br>
directions. As the wafers 104 and 106 are oppositely poled, the walls 118 of<br>
the channels serve as wall actuators of the so called "chevron" type, such as<br>
are the subject of European Patents No. 0277703 and No. 0278590, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These actuators<br>
are known to be advantageous because they require a lower actuating voltage<br>
to establish the same pressure in the fluid channels during operation.<br>
After forming the channels 112, the wafers are diced to form a module as<br>
shown in Figure 1. In the preferred embodiment, the module includes 64 fluid<br>
channels, each with a length of 2 mm (approximately equal to 2 x the acoustic<br>
length of ink in the channel during operation).<br>
With reference to Figure 3, metallised plating is deposited on the opposing<br>
faces of the ink channels 112, where it extends the full height of the channel<br>
walls 118 providing actuation electrodes 120 to which a passivation coating<br>
may be applied. In one technique for forming the electrodes, a seed layer,<br>
such as Nd:YAG, is sputtered over the module 100 and into the channels 112.<br>
An interconnect pattern 122 is formed one or both sides 124 of the module<br><br>
100, for example, by using the well-known laser ablation, photoresist or<br>
masking technique. Formation of the interconnect pattern on both sides 124<br>
of the module can halve the density of the tracks of the interconnect pattern,<br>
thereby facilitating formation of the interconnect pattern. With the seed layer<br>
having been defined, the layer is plated to form the electrode tracks, for<br>
example, using an electroless nickel plating process. The tops of the walls<br>
118 separating the channels 112 are kept free of plating metal so that the<br>
track and the electrode for each channel are electrically isolated from other<br>
channels.<br>
With reference to Figures 4 and 5, each module is connected to at least one<br>
associated drive circuitry (integrated circuit ("chip") 130) by means, for<br>
example, of a flexible circuit 132. In the arrangement shown in Figure 4, the<br>
module 100 has interconnection tracks formed on one side only, and thus only<br>
one chip 130 is required to drive the actuators 118, In the Figure 5<br>
arrangement, the module 100 has interconnection tracks formed on both sides<br>
of the module, with two chips 130 driving the actuators 118. Via holes 133<br>
may be formed in the flexible circuit 132 to enable the chip to be connected<br>
to other components of the drive circuitry, such as resistors, capacitors or the<br>
like.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the module 100 is attached to a support member 140.<br>
The drive circuitry 130 may be connected to the module prior to its attachment<br>
to the support member, thereby enabling the module to be tested prior to<br>
attachment on the support member, or may be connected to the module when<br>
it is already attached to the support member 140.<br>
As described in more detail below, in the embodiment shown in Figure 5 the<br>
support member 140 is made of a material having good thermal conduction<br>
properties. Of such materials, aluminium is particularly preferred on the<br>
grounds that it can be easily and cheaply formed by extrusion. In order to<br>
reduce the size of the printhead in the direction of paper feed, the support<br><br>
member 140 has a thickness in the direction of the length of the fluid channels<br>
substantially equal to the length of the fluid channels.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the connection of conduits for conveying ink to and from the<br>
module shown in Figure 5 in a first embodiment of a droplet deposition<br>
apparatus. The conduits comprise a first ink supply manifold 150 for supplying<br>
ink to the module 100 and a second ink supply manifold 152 for conveying ink<br>
away from the manifold 152. In the arrangement shown in Figure 6, the<br>
manifolds 150, 152 are configured so as to convey ink to and from all of the<br>
ink channels of the module 100. The manifolds may be formed from any<br>
suitable material, such as plastics material.<br>
With reference to Figure 7, a heatsink 160 is connected to the ink outlet 154<br>
of the second manifold 152. The heatsink is hollow, and is used to convey ink<br>
away from the second manifold 152 to an ink reservoir (not shown). As shown<br>
in Figure 7, the drive circuits 130 are mounted in substantial thermal contact<br>
with the heatsink 160 so as to allow a substantial amount of the heat<br>
generated by the circuits during their operation to transfer via the heatsink 160<br>
to the ink. To this end, the heat sink 160 is also formed from material having<br>
good thermal conduction properties, such as aluminium. Thermally conductive<br>
pads 134, or adhesive, may be optionally employed to reduce resistance to<br>
heat transfer between circuits 130 and the heatsink 160.<br>
A nozzle plate 170 is bonded to the uppermost surface of the module 100.<br>
The nozzle plate 170 consists of a strip of polymer such as polyimide, for<br>
example Ube Industries polyimide UPILEX R or S, coated with a non-wetting<br>
coating as provided in US-A-5010356 (EP-B-0367438). The nozzle plate is<br>
bonded by application of a thin layer of glue, allowing the glue to form an<br>
adhesive bond between the nozzle plate 170 and the walls 118 then allowing<br>
the glue to cure. A row of nozzles, one for each ink channel 112, is formed in<br>
the nozzle Plate for example by UV excimer laser ablation, the row of nozzles<br>
extending in a direction orthogonal to the length of the ink channels 112 so<br><br>
that the actuators are so called "side shooter" actuators.<br>
The module 100, when supplied with ink and operated with suitable voltage<br>
signals via the tracks 124 may be traversed either normally or at a suitable<br>
angle to the direction of motion across a paper printing surface to deposit ink<br>
on the printing surface. Alternatively, an array of independent modules 100<br>
may be provided. The array layout may take any suitable form. For example,<br>
as shown in Figure 8, three 180 dpi resolution modules may be angled to the<br>
direction of feed of a printing surface 180 to form a 360 dpi resolution array,<br>
whilst Figure 9 shows "3-tier interleaved" array of modules and Figure 10<br>
shows a "2-row interleaved" array of modules 100 for providing the required<br>
printhead resolution.<br>
Such a modular array eliminates the need to serially butt together a plurality<br>
of modules at facing end surfaces to provide a printhead having the required<br>
droplet density. Nonetheless, such modules may be butted together to form<br>
a pagewide array of modules.<br>
A second embodiment of droplet deposition apparatus comprising such an<br>
arrangement of modules will now be described with reference to Figures 11 to<br>
13.<br>
With reference first to Figure 11, this embodiment comprises a plurality of<br>
modules 100, for example, as shown in Figure 4 with drive circuitry attached<br>
to one side 124 of the module 100. Each module is mounted on the end of an<br>
arm of a substantially U-shaped pagewide support member 200. On each<br>
arm, the modules are serially butted together at the edges 126 of the modules<br>
100, as shown in Figure 1, such that there is a single row of fluid channels<br>
extending orthogonal to the longitudinal axis, or length, of each of the ink<br>
channels 112. The modules may be butted together using glue bond material,<br>
and aligned using any suitable alignment technique. Each array of butted<br>
modules provides a 180 dpi resolution, and therefore the combination of two<br><br>
interleaved arrays formed on respective arms of the support member 200<br>
provides a printhead having a 360 dpi resolution.<br>
Similar to the first embodiment, the chips 130 are mounted on the outer<br>
surface of the support member 200 so as to lie in substantial thermal contact<br>
with the support member 200. As shown in Figure 11, further components 202<br>
of the drive circuitry may be connected to the chip 130 via a printed circuit<br>
board 204 mounted on the track using solder bumps 206. Following mounting<br>
of the chips on the support member 200, each track 132 is folded in the<br>
direction indicated by arrows 208, 210 in Figure 11 so that the printed circuit<br>
boards 204 also come into thermal contact with the support member 200.<br>
As described in more detail below, the U-shaped support member 200 acts as<br>
an outlet manifold for conveying fluid away from the droplet ejection units. The<br>
drive circuits 130 for the modules 100 are mounted in substantial thermal<br>
contact with that part of structure 200 acting as the outlet manifold so as to<br>
allow a substantial amount of the heat generated by the circuits during their<br>
operation to transfer via the conduit structure to the ink. To this end, the<br>
structure 200 is made of a material having good thermal conduction properties,<br>
such as aluminium.<br>
With reference to Figure 12, ink inlet manifolds 210, 220 extending<br>
substantially the entire length of the support member 200 are provided for<br>
supplying ink to each of the modules attached to respective arms of the<br>
support member (only one module 100 is shown in figure 11 for clarity<br>
purposes only). The inlet manifolds 210, 220 may be formed from extruded<br>
plastics or metallic materials. As will be appreciated from Figure 12, the inlet<br>
manifolds also act to provide external covers to protect the components 202<br>
of the drive circuitry for the modules 100. Endcaps (not shown) are fitted to<br>
the ends of the support member 200 and inlet manifolds 210, 220 to form<br>
seals to complete the inlet and outlet manifolds and to enclose the drive<br>
circuitry.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 13, similar to the first embodiment a nozzle plate 230<br>
is attached to the tops of the actuator walls 118 and two rows of nozzles<br>
formed in the nozzle plate, one row for each of the rows of ink channels. As<br>
shown in figure 13, the nozzle plate 230 is additionally supported on each side<br>
by portions 240 of the ink inlet manifolds 210, 220. The nozzle plate 230 may<br>
be further supported by a support blanking actuator component (not shown)<br>
provided at each end of each of the arrays of modules.<br>
An example of another arrangement of butted modules will now be described<br>
with reference to Figures 14 to 18, in which the U-shaped support member 200<br>
is replaced by a planar, parallel-sided support member 300.<br>
With reference to Figures 14 and 15, two rows 302, 304 of modules are<br>
attached to the support member 300. Whilst Figure 14 shows two rows of four<br>
butted modules, any number of modules may be butted together, although it<br>
is preferred that the length of each row is substantially equal to the length of<br>
a page (typically 12.6 inches (32 cm) for the American "Foolscap" standard).<br>
The support member 300 is preferably formed from ceramic material, such as<br>
alumina. This enables the base wafer 102 of the modules 100 to be omitted,<br>
thereby reducing further the number of components of the printhead. If so, the<br>
first layer 104 of each module is attached directly to the support member 300,<br>
for example, using a resilient glue bond. Similar to the module shown in<br>
Figure 1, a second piezoelectric layer 106 is attached to the first piezoelectric<br>
layer 104.<br>
Similar to the arrangement shown in figure 1, ink channels 112 are formed in<br>
the piezoelectric layers 104,106 by, for example, machining and electrodes<br>
and interconnect tracks are formed in the channels 112 and on both sides of<br>
the support member 300 (only a small number of ink channels and<br>
interconnects are shown in Figure 14 for clarity purposes only). The ink<br><br>
channels are formed such that each ink channel of one row 302 is co-axial<br>
with an ink channel of the other row 304.<br>
Drive circuitry, or chips 130, are attached directly to the sides of the support<br>
member 300 for supplying electrical pulses to the interconnect tracks to<br>
actuate the walls 118 of the channels 112. As the support member is formed<br>
from alumina, for example, having a relatively low CTE, this substantially<br>
prevents heat generated in the chips 130 from being transferred through the<br>
support member to the actuators 118. The drive circuitry may be coated, for<br>
example, with parylene.<br>
Housings 306 for housing electrical connections to the chips 130 are also<br>
attached to each side of the support member 300. The housings 306 may be<br>
conveniently formed from injection moulded plastics material. In addition, a<br>
fluid inlet/outlet 308 is also attached to each side of the support member 300.<br>
The fluid inlet/outlet may be integral with the adjacent housing 306, and may<br>
include a filter, especially at the inlet side, for filtering ink to be supplied to the<br>
modules.<br>
A cover 310 extends over the entire length and to both sides of the support<br>
member 300. As shown in figure 16, the base of the support member 300<br>
and both ends of the cover 310 are attached to a base plate 315. The cover<br>
is preferably formed from a material that is thermally matched to the material<br>
of the piezoelectric wafers 104,106. Molybdenum, which has high strength<br>
and thermal conductivity in addition to being thermally matched to PZT, has<br>
been found to be a particularly suitable material for the cover.<br>
The cover 310 defines with the support member an ink inlet conduit 320 and<br>
an ink outlet conduit 330 for conveying ink to and from all of the channels of<br>
the two rows 302,304 of modules as indicated by arrows 335 in Figure 15.<br>
Endcaps (not shown) are fitted to the ends of the support member 300 and<br>
cover 310 to form seals to complete, with the housings 306, the inlet and outlet<br><br>
conduits and to enclose the electronics.<br>
The co-axial arrangement of the ink channels of the two rows enables ink to<br>
flow from the ink inlet conduit 320 into an ink channel of row 302, from that ink<br>
channel directly into an ink channel of the other row 304, and from that ink<br>
channel to the ink outlet conduit 330. With the arrangement of chips 130 on<br>
the sides of the support member 300, heat generated at the surfaces of the<br>
chips in thermal contact with the ink carried by the conduits 320,330 is<br>
substantially transferred to the ink.<br>
As shown in Figure 17, apertures 340 are formed in the cover 310 to enable<br>
ink to be ejected from the modules through the cover 310. The apertures 340<br>
may be formed by any suitable method, for example, UV excimer laser<br>
ablation, and may serve as nozzles for the droplet ejection modules,<br>
alternatively, as shown in Figure 18, a nozzle plate 350 may be attached to the<br>
cover, with nozzles being formed in the nozzle plate 350 such that the nozzles<br>
are in fluid communication with the ink channels 112 via the apertures 340.<br>
As the nozzle plate 350 is supported by the cover 310, this enables the<br>
thickness of the nozzle plate to be reduced. Alternatively, the nozzle plate 350<br>
may be attached directly to the modules, with the cover 310 extending over the<br>
nozzle plate with apertures 340 aligned with the nozzles formed in the nozzle<br>
plate.<br>
Operation of the third embodiment will now be described.<br>
In its simplest form, when one pair of actuator walls 118 one row, say 304 are<br>
required to eject a droplet of fluid from the ink channel 112 between the<br>
actuator walls 118, the walls of the ink channel of row 304 which is co-axial<br>
with that ink channel may be driven to replicate the acoustics of an ink<br>
manifold disposed at the end of that ink channel. In the case of "grey scale"<br>
printing, a number of droplets may be ejected from the ink channel of row 302,<br>
followed by a similar number of droplets from the co-axial ink channel of row<br><br>
304. Alternatively, in order to increase the printing speed, a droplet may be<br>
fired from each channel in turn. For example, ink can be drawn into one<br>
channel followed by (at some specific frequency) by a similar event in the<br>
other co-axial channel. This would provide a constant stable acoustic effect<br>
within each channel.<br>
Whilst the embodiment shown with reference to Figures 14 to 18 includes two<br>
rows of modules, a single row of ink modules may alternatively be used. Such<br>
an arrangement is shown in Figure 19. In this embodiment, a single row 402<br>
of modules is attached to the support member 400. Whilst Figure 19 shows<br>
four butted modules, any number of modules may be butted together, although<br>
it is preferred that the length of each row is substantially equal to the length<br>
of a page (typically 12.6 inches (32 cm) for the American "Foolscap" standard).<br>
With such an arrangement, the width of the support member may be reduced<br>
to substantially the length of a single ink channel 112, and chips 130<br>
connected to one side only of the support member. However, there will, of<br>
course, be a reduction in the resolution of the printhead (from 360 dpi to 180<br>
dpi). Resolution may be increased by providing two such arrangements "back<br>
to back" with a common ink inlet provided between the rows of modules.<br>
Figure 20 shows a simplified cross-sectional view of a fifth embodiment of an<br>
arrangement of droplet ejection modules with fluid conduits for the supply of<br>
fluid to the modules. In this embodiment, the support structure 500 comprises<br>
a laminated structure of multiple sheets of alumina. In the embodiment shown<br>
in figure 20, there are 4 laminated sheets 502, 504, 506, 508 of alumina,<br>
although any number of sheets may be used.<br>
The sheets of the support structure 500 are machined or otherwise shaped to<br>
define, in the laminated structure, channels 510, 512 for conveying ink towards<br>
and away from one or more modules 514 attached to the support structure<br>
500. As shown in Figure 20, channel 510 conveys ink to conduit 516<br>
extending along one side of module 514 for supplying ink to the module 514,<br><br>
and channel 512 conveys ink away from conduit 518 extending along the other<br>
side of module 514.<br>
Conduit 518 is defined by a cover member 520 attached to the top of the<br>
module 514 and having apertures 522 such that nozzles 524 of nozzle plate<br>
526 are in fluid communication with the ink channels of the module via the<br>
apertures 522, and by end cap 528 attached to the side of the support<br>
structure. Whilst conduit 516 may be defined in a similar manner, in the<br>
arrangement shown in Figure 20 this conduit is common to two support<br>
structures 500, and so alternatively this conduit is defined by the cover<br>
member 520 and alumina plate 530 to which the two support structures are<br>
attached.<br>
Similar to the previous embodiments, drive circuitry 130 is attached directly to<br>
the sides of the support member 500 for supplying electrical pulses to the<br>
interconnect tracks to actuate the walls of the channels of the module. As the<br>
support member is formed from alumina, for example, having a relatively low<br>
CTE, this substantially prevents heat generated in the chips 130 from being<br>
transferred through the support member to the actuators. In this embodiment,<br>
however, the drive circuitry is not in fluid communication with the ink conveyed<br>
to and from the module, but is instead located in a housing formed in the end<br>
cap 528.<br>
Figure 21 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a further embodiment of an<br>
arrangement of droplet ejection modules with fluid conduits for the supply of<br>
fluid to the modules. This embodiment is similar to that of the fifth<br>
embodiment, in that a cover extends over and to the sides of the support<br>
member 300 to define a first conduit 320 and a second conduit 330 both<br>
extending along a row of droplet ejection channels and to the sides of the<br>
support member 130. In this embodiment, a single row of modules 302 is<br>
mounted on the end of a support member 300, and the first and second<br>
conduits 320 and 330 are spaced from the chips 130 mounted on the side of<br><br>
the support member 300 so as to avoid the need to passivate the surfaces of<br>
the chips 130. In order to dissipate heat generated by the chips 130 during<br>
operation, the support member 300 is formed from thermally conducting<br>
material in order to conduct heat generated by the chips 130 to the fluid<br>
conveyed by the conduits 320 and 330.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 22. two rows 302, 304 of ejection units are<br>
provided on a substantially U-shaped, or H-shaped, support member 600<br>
comprising a pair of support members 300a, 300b linked by a bridging wall<br>
602. Chips 130 and associated circuitry 602 are mounted on the facing<br>
surfaces of the support members 300a, 300b, interconnect tracks 600 being<br>
formed on these surfaces for supplying actuating electrical signals to the walls<br>
of the ejection units. Fluid is conveyed to and away from the ejection units by<br>
conduits 320, 330 defined by cover member 310 and the support member 600,<br>
the bridging wall 602 acting to direct fluid from the first row 302 to the second<br>
row 304. Heat generated in the chips 130 during operation is conducted by<br>
the support members 300a, 300b into fluid carried by the conduits 320, 330.<br>
Figure 23 illustrates an embodiment in which heat generated during operation<br>
both by the chips 130 mounted on either side of the support member 650 and<br>
by the rows 302, 304 of ejection units mounted on the support member is<br>
transferred to a coolant fluid, such as water, conveyed by a conduit 660<br>
passing through the support member 650. The walls 670 of the support<br>
member are preferably suitably thin so that heat is conducted to the coolant<br>
fluid as quickly as possible. To improve conduction, the walls 670 may be<br>
formed from metallic material. The body 675 of the support member may be<br>
formed from ceramic material.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 23, there is no recirculation of droplet fluid,<br>
in that the conduit 330 simply receives fluid from the ejection units 304 and<br>
does not convey fluid back to a reservoir for re-use. Figure 24 illustrates a<br><br>
modification of this embodiment, in which conduit 330 is configured to convey<br>
fluid back to a reservoir for re-use.<br>
Figure 25 illustrates an embodiment in which each row 302, 304 of ejection<br>
units is mounted on a respective support member 300. Fluid is conveyed to<br>
each row by a respective conduit 320 extending along that row and to one side<br>
of the support member on which that row is mounted. Fluid is conveyed away<br>
from the rows by a mutual conduit 330 extending between the facing side walls<br>
of the two support members 300, heat generated by the chips 130 being<br>
transferred to fluid conveyed in the conduit 330. Providing two "inlet" conduits<br>
320 can enable the printhead to be flushed effectively during production to<br>
remove dirt. A slow bleed of droplet fluids from one of the conduits 320 can<br>
be used to remove air bubbles during printing, whilst a larger flow could be<br>
induced during a pause in printing for maintenance purposes.<br>

independently of other disclosed and/or illustrated features.<br><br>
