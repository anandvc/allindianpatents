				<td>A PROCESS FOR CATHODICALLY ELECTRODEPOSITING<br>
A SELECTED METALLIC MATERIAL PERMANENT OR<br>
TEMPORARY SUBSTRATE IN NANOCRYSTALLINE FORM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for cathodically electrodepositing a<br>
selected metallic material permanent or temporary substrate in nanocrystalline<br>
form, and particularly to a process for forming coatings of pure metals, metal<br>
alloys or metal matrix composites on a work piece which is electrically conductive<br>
or contains an electrically conductive surface layer or<br>
forming free-standing deposits of nano-crystalline metals, metal alloys or metal<br>
matrix composites by employing pulse electrodeposition. The process employs a<br>
drum plating process for the continuous production of nanocrystalline foils of pure<br>
metals, metal alloys or metal matrix composites or a selective plating (brush<br>
plating) process, the processes involving pulse electrodeposition and a non-<br>
stationary anode or cathode. Novel nano-crystalline metal matrix composites are<br>
disclosed as well. The invention also relates to a pulse plating process for the<br>
fabrication or coating of micro -components. The invention also relates to micro-<br>
components with grain sizes below 1,000nm.<br>
The novel process can be applied to establish wear resistant coatings and foils of<br>
pure metals or alloys of metals selected from the group of Ag, Au, Cu, Co, Cr, Ni,<br>
Fe, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Sn, V, W and Zn and alloying elements selected from C, P,<br>
S and Si and metal matrix composites of pure metals or alloys with particulate<br>
additives such as metal powders, metal alloy powders and metal oxide powders of<br>
Al, Co, Cu, In, Mg, Ni, Si, Sn, V, and Zn; nitrides of Al, B and Si; C (graphite or<br>
diamond); carbides of B, Cr, Bi, Si, W; and organic materials such as PTFE and<br>
polymer spheres. The selective plating process is particularly suited for in-situ or<br>
field applications such as the repair or the refurbishment of dies and moulds, tur-<br>
bine plates, steam generator tubes, core reactor head penetrations of nuclear power<br>
plants and the like. The continuous plating process is particularly suited for pro-<br>
ducing nanocrystalline foils e.g. for magnetic applications. The process can be<br>
applied to high strength, equiaxed micro-components for use in electronic, bio-<br>
medical, telecommunication, automotive, space and consumer applications.<br>
Description of Prior Art/Background of the Invention<br>
Nanocrystalline materials, also referred to as ultra-fine grained materials, nano-<br>
phase materials or nanometer-sized materials exhibiting average grains sizes<br>
smaller or equal to l00nm, are known to be synthesized by a number of methods<br>
including sputtering, laser ablation, inert gas condensation, high energy ball mill-<br>
ing, sol-gel deposition and electrodeposition. Electrodeposition offers the capa-<br>
bility to prepare a large number of fully dense metal and metal alloy compositions<br>
at high production rates and low capital investment requirements in a single syn-<br>
thesis step.<br>
The prior art primarily describes the use of pulse electrodeposition for producing<br>
nanocrystalline materials.<br>
Erb in US 5,352,266 (1994) and in US 5,433,797 (1995) describes a process for<br>
producing nanocrystalline materials, particularly nanocrystalline nickel. The na-<br>
nocrystalline material is electrodeposited onto the cathode in an aqueous acidic<br>
electrolytic cell by application of a pulsed DC current. The cell also optionally<br>
contains stress relievers. Products of the invention include wear resistant coat-<br>
ings, magnetic materials and catalysts for hydrogen evolution.<br>
Mori in US 5,496,463 (1996) describes a process and apparatus for composite<br>
electroplating a metallic material containing SiC, BN, Si3N4, WC, TiC, TiO2,<br>
Al2O, ZnB3, diamond, CrC, MoS2, coloring materials, polytetrafluoroethylene<br>
(PTFE) and microcapsules. The solid particles are introduced in fine form into<br>
the electrolyte.<br>
Adler in US 4,240,894 (1980) describes a drum plater for electrodeposited Cu foil<br>
production. Cu is plated onto a rotating metal drum that is partially submersed and<br>
rotated in a Cu plating solution. The Cu foil is stripped from the drum surface<br>
emerging from the electrolyte, which is clad with electroformed Cu. The rotation<br>
speed of the drum and the current density are used to adjust the desired thickness<br>
of the Cu foil. The Cu foil stripped from the drum surface is subsequently washed<br>
and dried and wound into a suitable coil.<br>
Icxi in US 2,961,395 (1960) discloses a process for electroplating an article with-<br>
out the necessity to immerse the surface being treated into a plating tank. The<br>
hand-manipulated applicator serves as anode and applies chemical solutions to the<br>
metal surface of the work piece to be plated. The work piece to be plated serves<br>
as cathode. The hand applicator anode with the wick containing the electrolyte<br>
and the work piece cathode are connected to a DC power source to generate a<br>
metal coating on the work piece by passing a DC current.<br>
Micromechanical systems (MEMS) are machines constructed of small moving<br>
and stationary parts having overall dimensions ranging from 1 to 1,000um e.g. for<br>
use in electronic, biomedical, telecommunication, automotive, space and con-<br>
sumer technologies.<br>
Such components are made e.g. by photo-electroforming, which is an additive<br>
process in which powders are deposited in layers to build the desired structure e.g.<br>
by laser enhanced electroless plating. Lithography, electroforming and molding<br>
(LIGA) and other photolithography related processes are used to overcome aspect<br>
ratio (parts height to width) related problems. Other techniques employed include<br>
silicon micromachining, through mask plating and microcontact printing.<br>
3. Summary:<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a reliable and flexible pulse plating pro-<br>
cess for forming coatings or free-standing deposits of nano-crvstalline metals,<br>
metal alloys or metal matrix composites.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide micro components with signifi-<br>
cantly improved property-dependent reliability and improved and tailor-made<br>
desired properties for overall performance enhanced microsystems. <br>
Prefered embodiments of the invention are defined in the corresponding depend-<br>
ent claims.<br>
The present invention provides a pulse plating process, consisting of a single ca-<br>
thodic on time or multiple cathodic on times of different current densities and sin-<br>
gle or multiple off times per cycle. Periodic pulse reversal, a bipolar waveform<br>
alternating between cathodic pulses and anodic pulses, can optionally be used as<br>
well. The anodic pulses can be inserted into the waveform before, after or in be-<br>
tween the on pulse and/or before, after or in the off time. The anodic pulse cur-<br>
rent density is generally equal to or greater than the cathodic current density. The<br>
anodic charge (Qanodic) of the "reverse pulse" per cycle is always smaller than the<br>
cathodic charge (Qcathodic).<br>
Cathodic pulse on times range from 0.1 to 50 msec (1-50), off times from 0 to<br>
500msec (1-100) and anodic pulse times range from 0 to 50 msec, preferably from<br>
1 to 10msec. The duty cycle, expressed as the cathodic on times divided by the<br>
sum of the cathodic on times, the off times and the anodic times, ranges from 5 to<br>
100 %, preferably from 10 to 95 %, and more preferably from 20 to 80 %. The<br>
frequency of the cathodic pulses ranges from 1Hz to 1kHz and more preferably<br>
from l0Hz to 350Hz.<br>
Nano-crystalline coatings or free-standing deposits of metallic materials were ob-<br>
tained by varying process parameters such as current density, duty cycle, work<br>
piece temperature, plating solution temperature, solution circulation rates over a<br>
wide range of conditions. The following listing describes suitable operating pa-<br>
rameter ranges for practising the invention:<br>
Average current density (if determinable, anodically or cathodically): 0.01 to<br>
20A/cm2, preferably 0,1 to 20A/cm2, more preferably 1 to 10A/cm2<br>
Duty Cycle 5 to 100%<br>
Frequency: 0 to l000Hz <br>
Electrolyte solution temperature: - 20 to 85 °C <br>
Electrolyte solution circulation/agitation rates: 
cathode area (0.0001 to 101/min.cm2)<br>
Work piece temperature: -20 to 45 °C<br>
Anode oscillation rate: 0 to 350 oscillations/min<br>
Anode versus cathode linear speed: 0 to 200 meter/min (brush) 0.003 to<br>
0.16m/min (drum)<br>
-6-<br>
The present invention preferably provides a process for plating nanocrystalline<br>
metals, metal matrix composites and microcomponents at deposition rates of at<br>
least 0.05 mm/h, preferably at least 0.075 mm/h, and more preferably at least<br>
0.1 mm/h.<br>
In the process of the present invention the electrolyte preferably may be agitated<br>
by means of pumps, stirrers or ultrasonic agitation at rates of 0 to 750 ml/min/A<br>
(ml solution per minute per applied Ampere average current), preferably at rates<br>
of 1 to 500 ml/min/A.<br>
In the process of the present invention optionally a grain refining agent or a stress<br>
relieving agent selected from the group of saccharin, coumarin, sodium lauryl<br>
sulfate and thiourea can be added to the electrolyte.<br>
This invention provides a process for plating nanocrystalline metal matrix com-<br>
posites on a permanent or temporary substrate optionally containing at least 5%<br>
by volume particulates, preferably 10% by volume particulates, more preferably<br>
20% by volume particulates, even more preferably 30% by volume particulates<br>
and most preferably 40% by volume particulates for applications such as hard<br>
facings, projectile blunting armor, valve refurbishment, valve and machine tool<br>
coatings, energy absorbing armor panels, sound damping systems, connectors on<br>
pipe joints e.g. used in oil drilling applications, refurbishment of roller bearing<br>
axles in the railroad industry, computer chips, repair of electric motors and gen-<br>
erator parts, repair of scores in print rolls using tank, barrel, rack, selective (e.g.<br>
brush plating) and continuous (e.g. drum plating) plating processes using pulse<br>
electrodeposition. The particulates can be selected from the group of metal pow-<br>
ders, metal alloy powders and metal oxide powders of Al, Co, Cu, In, Mg, Ni, Si,<br>
Sn, V, and Zn; nitrides of Al, B and Si; C (graphite or diamond); carbides of B,<br>
Bi, Cr, Si, W; M0S2; and organic materials such as PTFE and polymer spheres.<br>
The particulate average particle size is typically below 10 mm, preferably below<br>
1000 nm (1 mm), preferably 500 nm, and more preferably below 100 nm. The<br>
particulate additives average particle size may be in the range of 100 nm to 10<br>
pm, in the range of 500 nm to 10 mm, in the range of 1000 nm to 10 mm or below<br>
100 nm.<br>
The process of this invention optionally provides a process for continuous (drum<br>
or belt) plating nanocrystalline foils optionally containing solid particles in sus-<br>
pension selected from metal powders, metal alloy powders and metal oxide pow-<br>
ders of Al, Co, Cu, In, Mg, Ni, Si, Sn, V, and Zn; nitrides of Al, B and Si; C<br>
(graphite or diamond); carbides of B, Bi, Si, W; M0S2, and organic materials such<br>
as PTFE and polymer spheres to impart desired properties including hardness,<br>
wear resistance, lubrication, magnetic properties and the like. The drum or belt<br>
provides a temporary substrate from which the plated foil can be easily and con-<br>
tinuously removed.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention it is also possible to<br>
produce nanocrystalline coatings by electroplating without the need to submerse<br>
the article to be coated into a plating bath. Brush or tampon plating is a suitable<br>
alternative to tank plating, particularly when only a portion of the work piece is to<br>
be plated, without the need to mask areas not to be plated. The brush plating ap-<br>
paratus typically employs a soluble or dimensionally stable anode wrapped in an<br>
absorbent separator felt to form the anode brush. The brush is rubbed against the<br>
surface to be plated in a manual or mechanized mode and electrolyte solution<br>
containing ions of the metal or metal alloys to be plated is injected into the sepa-<br>
rator felt. Optionally, this solution also contains solid particles in suspension se-<br>
lected from metal powders, metal alloy powders and metal oxide powders of Al,<br>
Co, Cu, In, Mg, Ni, Si, Sn, V, and Zn; nitrides of Al, B and Si; C (graphite or<br>
diamond); carbides of Bi, Si, W; M0S2; and organic materials such as PTFE and<br>
polymer spheres to impart desired properties including hardness, wear resistance,<br>
lubrication and the like.<br>
In the case of drum, belt or brush plating the relative motion between anode and<br>
cathode ranges from 0 to 600meters per minute, preferably from 0.003 to<br>
l0meters per minute.<br>
In the process of this invention micro components for micro systems including<br>
micro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and micro-optical-systems with grain sizes<br>
equal to or smaller than 1,000nm can be produced. The maximum dimension of<br>
the microcomponent part is equal to or below lmm and the ratio between the<br>
maximum outside dimension of the microcomponent part and the average grain<br>
size is equal to or greater than 10, preferably greater than 100.<br>
The micro components of the present invention preferably may have an equiaxed<br>
microstructure throughout the plated component, which is relatively independent<br>
 of component thickness and structure.<br>
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide micro components where<br>
the average grain size remains at least an order of magnitude smaller than the ex-<br>
ternal dimensions of the part, thus maintaining a high level of strength.<br>
The micro components according to this invention have significantly improved<br>
property-dependent reliability and improved and tailor-made desired properties of<br>
MEMS structures for overall performance enhanced microsystems by preferably<br>
equiaxed electrodeposits, eliminating the fine grain to columnar grain transition in<br>
the microcomponent, and simultaneously reducing the grain size of the deposits<br>
below l,000nm.<br>
Other features and advantages of this invention will become more apparent in<br>
the following detailed description and examples of preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, together with the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of a preferred embodiment of a drum plat-<br>
ing apparatus.<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross sectional view of a preferred embodiment of a brush plat-<br>
ing apparatus; and<br>
Figure 3 shows a plan view of a mechanized motion apparatus for generating a<br>
mechanized stroke of the anode brush.<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows of a plating tank or vessel (1) filled with an elec-<br>
trolyte (2) containing the ions of the metallic material to be plated. Partially sub-<br>
mersed into the electrolyte is the cathode in the form of a rotating drum (3) elec-<br>
trically connected to a power source (4). The drum is rotated by an electric motor<br>
(not shown) with a belt drive and the rotation speed is variable. The anode (5) can<br>
be a plate or conforming anode, as shown, which is electrically connected to the<br>
power source (4). Three different anode dispositions can be used: Conformal an-<br>
odes, as shown in Figure 1, that follow the contour of the submerged section of<br>
the drum (3), vertical anodes positioned at the walls of the tank (1) and horizontal<br>
anode positioned on the bottom of the tank (1). In case of a foil (16) of metallic<br>
material being electrodeposited on the drum (3), the foil (16) is pulled from the<br>
drum surface emerging from the electrolyte (2), which is clad with the electro-<br>
formed metallic material.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows a workpiece (6) to be plated, which is connected to<br>
the negative outlet of the power source (4). The anode (5) consists of a handle (7)<br>
with a conductive anode brush (8). The anode contains channels (9) for supplying<br>
the electrolyte solution (2) from a temperature controlled tank (not shown) to the<br>
anode wick (absorbent separator) (10) . The electrolyte dripping from the absorb-<br>
ent separator (10) is optionally collected in a tray (11) and recirculated to the tank.<br>
The absorbent separator (10) containing the electrolyte (2) also electrically insu-<br>
lates the anode brush (8) from the workpiece (6) and adjusts the spacing between<br>
anode (5) and cathode (6). The anode brush handle (4) can be moved over the<br>
workpiece (6) manually during the plating operation, alternatively, the motion can<br>
be motorized as shown in figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows a wheel (12) driven by an adjustable speed motor<br>
(not shown). A traversing arm (13) can be rotatably attached (rotation axis A) to<br>
the rotating wheel (12) at various positions x at a slot (14) with a bushing and a<br>
set screw (not shown) to generate a desired stroke. The stroke lenght can be ad-<br>
justed by the position x (radius) at which the rotation axis A of traversing arm is<br>
mounted at the slot (14). In Figure 3 the traversing arm (13) is shown to be in an<br>
no-stroke, neutral position with rotation axis A in the center of the wheel (12).<br>
The traversing arm (13) has a second pivot axis B defined by a bearing (not<br>
shown), that is slidably mounted in a track (15). As the wheel (12) rotates, the<br>
rotation of the traversing arm (13) around axis A at position x causes the travers-<br>
ing arm (13) to reciprocate in the track (15) and to pivot around axis B. An anode<br>
(5) having the same features as shown in Fig. 2 is attached to the traversing arm<br>
(13) and moves over the workpiece (6) in a motion depending on the position x.<br>
Usually the motion has the shape of figure eight. The anode (5) and the work-<br>
piece (6) are connected to positive and negative outlets of a power source (not<br>
shown), respectively. The cinematic relation is very similar to that of a steam<br>
engine.<br>
This invention relies on producing nanocrystalline coatings, foils and microsystem<br>
components by pulse electrodeposition. Optionally solid particles are suspended<br>
in the electrolyte and are included in the deposit.<br>
Nanocrystalline coatings for wear resistant applications to date have focused on<br>
increasing wear resistance by increasing hardness and decreasing the friction coef-<br>
ficient though grain size reduction below l00nm. It has now been found that in-<br>
corporating a sufficient volume fraction of hard particles can further enhance the<br>
wear resistance of nanocrystalline materials.<br>
The material properties can also be altered by e.g. the incorporation of lubricants<br>
(such as M0S2 and PTFE). Generally, the particulates can be selected from the<br>
group of metal powders, metal alloy powders and metal oxide powders of Al, Co,<br>
Cu, In, Mg, Ni, Si, Sn, V, and Zn; nitrides of Al, B and Si; C (graphite or dia-<br>
mond); carbides of B, Bi, Si, W; M0S2; and organic materials such as PTFE and<br>
polymer spheres.<br>

The hardness values of metal matrix composites possessing a nanocrystalline ma-<br>
trix structure are typically twice as high as conventional coarse-grained metal ma-<br>
trix composites. In addition, the hardness and wear properties of a nanocrystalline<br>
N1P-B4C composite containing 5.9weight% P and 45volume% B4C are compared<br>
with those of pure coarse-grained Ni, pure nanocrystalline Ni and electrodeposited<br>
Ni-P of an equivalent chemical composition in the adjacent table. Material hard-<br>
ening is controlled by Hall-Petch grain size strengthening, while abrasive wear<br>
resistance is concurrently optimized by the incorporation of B4C participate.<br>

taining matrix composites, a stream of the composite addition was added to the<br>

low the contour of the submerged section of the drum, vertical anodes positioned<br>
at the walls of the vessel and horizontal anode positioned on the bottom of the<br>

Selective or brush plating is a portable method of selectively plating localized<br>
areas of a work piece without submersing the article into a plating tank. There are<br>
significant differences between selective plating and tank and barrel plating appli-<br>
cations. In the case of selective plating it is difficult to accurately determine the<br>
cathode area and therefore the cathodic current density and/or peak current density<br>
is variable and usually unknown. The anodic current density and/or peak current<br>
density can be determined, provided that the same anode area is utilized during<br>
the plating operation, e.g. in the case of flat anodes. In the case of shaped anodes<br>
the anode area can not be accurately determined e.g. in the case of a shaped anode<br>
and a shaped cathode the "effective" anode area also changes during the plating<br>
operation. Selective plating is performed by moving the anode, which is covered<br>
with the absorbent separator wick and containing the electrolyte, back and forth<br>
over the work piece, which is typically performed by an operator until the desired<br>
overall area is coated to the required thickness.<br>
Selective plating techniques are particularly suited for repairing or refurbishing<br>
articles because brush plating set-ups are portable, easy to operate and do not re-<br>
quire the disassembly of the system containing the work piece to be plated. Brush<br>
plating also allows plating of parts too large for immersion into plating tanks.<br>
Brush plating is used to provide coatings for improved corrosion resistance, im-<br>
proved wear, improved appearance (decorative plating) and can be used to salvage<br>
worn or mismachined parts. Brush plating systems and plating solutions are com-<br>
mercially available e.g. from Sifco Selective Plating, Cleveland. Ohio, which also<br>
provides mechanized and/or automated tooling for use in high volume production<br>
work. The plating tools used comprise the anode (DSA or soluble), covered with<br>
an absorbent, electrically non-conductive material and an insulated handle. In the<br>
case of DSA anodes, anodes are typically made of graphite or Pt-clad titanium and<br>
may contain means for regulating the temperature by means of a heat exchanger<br>
system. For instance, the electrolyte used can be heated or cooled and passed<br>
through the anode to maintain the desired temperature range. The absorbent sepa-<br>
rator material contains and distributes the electrolyte solution between the anode<br>
and the work piece (cathode), prevents shorts between anode and cathode and<br>
brushes against the surface of the area being plated. This mechanical rubbing or<br>
brushing motion imparted to the work piece during the plating process influences<br>
the quality and the surface finish of the coating and enables fast plating rates.<br>
Selective plating electrolytes are formulated to produce acceptable coatings in a<br>
wide temperature range ranging from as low as -20°C to 85°C. As the work piece<br>
is frequently large in comparison to the area being coated selective plating is often<br>
applied to the work piece at ambient temperatures, ranging from as low as -20°C<br>
to as high as 45°C. Unlike "typical" electroplating operations, in the case of se-<br>
lective plating the temperature of the anode, cathode and electrolyte can vary sub-<br>
stantially. Salting out of electrolyte constituents can occur at low temperatures<br>
and the electrolyte may have to be periodically or continuously reheated to dis-<br>
solve all precipitated chemicals.<br>
A Sifco brush plating unit (model 3030 - 30A max) was set up. The graphite an-<br>
ode tip was inserted into a cotton pouch separator and either attached to a mecha-<br>
nized traversing arm in order to generate the "brushing motion" or moved by an<br>
operator by hand back and forth over the work piece, or as otherwise indicated.<br>
The anode assembly was soaked in the plating solution and the coating was de-<br>
posited by brushing the plating tool against the cathodically charged work area<br>
that was composed of different substrates. A peristaltic pump was used to feed<br>
the electrolyte at predetermined rates into the brush plating tool. The electrolyte<br>
was allowed to drip off the work piece into a tray that also served as a "plating<br>
solution reservoir" from which it was recirculated into the electrolyte tank. The<br>
anode had flow-through holes/channels in the bottom surface to ensure good<br>
electrolyte distribution and electrolyte/work piece contact. The anode was fixed<br>
to a traversing arm and the cyclic motion was adjusted to allow uniform strokes of<br>
the anode against the substrate surface. The rotation speed was adjusted to in-<br>
crease or decrease the relative anode/cathode movement speed as well as the an-<br>
ode/substrate contact time at any one particular location. Brush plating was nor-<br>
mally carried out at a rate of approximately 35-175 oscillations per minute, with a<br>
rate of 50-85 oscillations per minute being optimal. Electrical contacts were made<br>
on the brush handle (anode) and directly on the work piece (cathode). Coatings<br>
were deposited onto a number of substrates, including copper, 1018 low carbon<br>
steel, 4130 high carbon steel, 304 stainless steel, a 2.5in OD steel pipe and a<br>
weldclad 1625 pipe. The cathode size was 8cm2, except for the 2.5in OD steel<br>
pipe where a strip 3cm wide around the outside diameter was exposed and the<br>
weldclad 1625 pipe on which a defect repair procedure was performed.<br>
A Dynatronix programmable pulse plating power supply (Dynanet PDPR 20-30-<br>
100) was employed.<br>
Standard substrate cleaning and activation procedures provided by Sifco were<br>
used.<br>
Example 5:<br>
Nanocrystalline pure nickel was deposited onto an 8cm2 area cathode with a<br>
35cm2 anode using the set-up described. Usually, the work piece has a substan-<br>
tially larger area than the anode. In this example a work piece (cathode) was se-<br>
lected to be substantially smaller than the anode to ensure that the oversized an-<br>
ode, although being constantly kept in motion, always covered the entire work<br>
piece to enable the determination of the cathodic current density. As a non-<br>
consumable anode was used, N1CO3 was periodically added to the plating bath to<br>
maintain the desired Ni2+ concentration. The following conditions were used:<br>

Microcomponents, having overall dimensions below l,000^im (lmm), are gaining<br>
increasing importance for use in electronic, biomedical, telecommunication,<br>
automotive, space and consumer applications. Metallic macro-system components<br>
with an overall maximum dimension of lcm to over lm containing conventional<br>
grain sized materials (l-l,000nm) exhibit a ratio between maximum dimension<br>
and grain size ranges from 10 to 106. This number reflects the number of grains<br>
across the maximum part dimension. When the maximum component size is re-<br>
duced to below lmm using conventional grain-sized material, the component can<br>
be potentially made of only a few grains or a single grain and the ratio between<br>
the maximum micro-component dimension and the grain size ranges approaches<br>
1. In other words, a single or only a few grains stretch across the entire part,<br>
which is undesirable. To increase the part reliability of micro-components the<br>
ratio between maximum part dimension and grain size ranges must be increased to<br>
over 10 through the utilization of a small grained material, as this material class<br>
typically exhibits grain size values 10 to 10,000 times smaller than conventional<br>
materials.<br>
For conventional LIGA and other plated micro-components, electrodeposition<br>
initially starts with a fine grain size at the substrate material. With increasing de-<br>
posit thickness in the growth direction; however, the transition to columnar grains<br>
is normally observed. The thickness of the columnar grains typically ranges from<br>
a few to a few tens of micrometers while their lengths can reach hundreds of mi-<br>
crometers. The consequence of such structures is the development of anisotropic<br>
properties with increasing deposit thickness and the reaching of a critical thick-<br>
ness in which only a few grains cover the entire cross section of the components<br>
with widths below 5 or 10 \im. A further decrease in component thickness results<br>
in a bamboo structure resulting in a significant loss in strength. Therefore the<br>
microstructure of electrodeposited micro-components currently in use is entirely<br>
incommensurate with property requirements across both the width and thickness<br>
of the component on the basis of grain shape and average grain size.<br>
Heretofore, parts made of conventionally grain-sized materials that have been<br>
known to suffer from severe reliability problems with respect to mechanical prop-<br>
erties such as the Young modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, fatigue<br>
strength and creep behavior have been shown to be extremely sensitive to proc-<br>
essing parameters associated with the synthesis of these components. Many of the<br>
problems encountered are caused by incommensurate scaling of key microstruc-<br>
tural features (i.e. grain size, grain shape, grain orientation) with the external size<br>
of the component resulting in unusual property variations normally not observed<br>
in macroscopic components of the same material.<br>
Example 9:<br>
Metal micro-spring fingers are used to contact IC chips with high pad count and<br>
density and to carry power and signals to and from the chips. The springs provide<br>
high pitch compliant electrical contacts for a variety of interconnection structures,<br>
including chip scale semiconductor packages, high-density interposer connectors,<br>
and probe contactors. The massively parallel interface structures and assemblies<br>
enable high speed testing of separated integrated circuit devices affixed to a com-<br>
pliant carrier, and allow test electronics to be located in close proximity to the<br>
integrated circuit devices under test.<br>
The micro-spring fingers require high yield strength and ductility. A 25 mm thick<br>
