				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a novel moisture sensor and a device for measuring<br>
moisture made thereof. This invention particularly relates to a sensor based<br>
on change in quality factor of a coil due to be absorption of moisture from<br>
high to low level.<br>
Measurement of moisture in general and gases in particular is very common<br>
in various types of applications especially for industrial processes where<br>
moisture sensitivity dictates product quality and yield. The various<br>
techniques for measuring moisture from extreme low to high value are<br>
mainly done in two methods. Which are the measurement of ac impedance<br>
and measurement of change in capacitance. In case of capacitative sensor a<br>
hygroscopic layer of aluminium oxide absorbs water molecules within its<br>
pores, depending on the water vapour pressure in its environment. The<br>
electrical capacitance is measured between the aluminium core of the sensor<br>
and the porous conductive gold layer on the outside. For conductive type<br>
sensor the hygroscopic material is either deposited on impervious insulating<br>
surfaces, on fibers or fabrics or on porous ceramics. These methods of<br>
detection suffer from various limitations such as, it will take a long time to<br>
come to equilibrium with the surrounding atmosphere, thus the dynamic<br>
response is poor and the indication of the system will show a lag, sometimes<br>
several hours. These methods of detection also suffer from various other<br>
limitations such as low sensitivity and high cost. To the best of our<br>
knowledge and belief there is no inductance type moisture sensor.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel moisture<br>
sensor that obviates the above noted drawbacks.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel moisture sensor<br>
that works on the principle of change in inductance.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a moisture sensor<br>
having a tape cast porous ceramic of composition<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device<br>
incorporating the sensor of the present invention for measuring moisture<br>
having fine sensitivity in the range of 100 ppm to 400 ppm with 0.05%<br>
resolution and response time less than 3 seconds.<br>
The moisture sensor of the present invention essentially consists of a<br>
enameled copper coil wound on a porous tape-cast tubular ceramic former<br>
enclosing a low density ceramic ferrie.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel moisture sensor, which comprises 32-37 gauge,<br>
Enameled copper coil wound on a porous tape cast tubular ceramic former enclosing a low density<br>
ceramic ferrite having diameter in the range of 10-12mm, length in the range 100-120-cm.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the copper coil may have 30-40 turns.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the porous tape cast tubular former may be made<br>
using material of pore size in the range of 0.1-0.6μm and having a composition such as<br>
In yet another embodiment the ferrite core used may have permeability in the rnge of 2000-8000,<br>
inductance 10-50μH, Q factor 200-250.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for measuring moisture, which comprises a<br>
novel moisture sensor, as, described above, being connected to an oscillator capable of inputting an<br>
angular frequency, the output of the said sensor being connected to a known Data Acquisition<br>
system.<br>
Field of application of the sensor of the present invention is for measuring moisture in any<br>
industrial process, some applications may be measurement moisture of powdered material,<br>
moisture present in non-toxic gases, agricultural field, food processing, for RH (relative<br>
humidity) measurement.<br>
The sensor works on the basic principle that a small voltage of certain<br>
frequency (800 KHz) is introduced to the sensor, the sensor shows some<br>
open circuit voltage, when it is placed in dry gas. When the moist gas is<br>
passed through the sample holder, due to the extremely small size of the<br>
pore, their Brownian motion will be limited, their energy will consequently<br>
be reduced and they will condense into liquid water. As a result the Q value<br>
will change. This change in Q value is measured as an index of moisture<br>
content at the testing zone.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in providing an inductance type<br>
moisture sensor. The inventive steps are providing an enameled copper coil<br>
wound on porous ceramic tubular tape cast former with ferrite core.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention and the manner in which it<br>
may be carried out in practice, however, this should not be construed to limit<br>
