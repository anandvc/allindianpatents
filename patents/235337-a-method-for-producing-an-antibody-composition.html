TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a cell for the production of an antibody molecule such as an antibody useful for various diseases, a fragment of the antibody and a fusion protein having the Fc region of the antibody or the like, a process for producing an antibody composition using the cell, the antibody composition and use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Since antibodies have high binding activity, binding specificity and high stability in blood, their applications to diagnosis, prevention and treatment of various human diseases have been attempted [Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications, Wiley-Liss, Inc., Chapter 2.1 (1995)]. Also, production of a humanized antibody such as a human chimeric antibody or a human complementarity determining region (hereinafter referred to as "CDR")-grafted antibody from an antibody derived from an animal other than human have been attempted by using genetic recombination techniques. The human chimeric antibody is an antibody in which its antibody variable region (hereinafter referred to as "V region") is an antibody derived from an animal other than human and its constant region (hereinafter referred to as "C region") is derived from a human antibody. The human CDR-grafted antibody is an antibody in which the CDR of a human antibody is replaced by CDR of an antibody derived from an animal other than human.<br>
It has been revealed that five classes, namely IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE, are present in antibodies derived from mammals. Antibodies of human IgG class are mainly used for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of various human diseases because they have fiinctional characteristics such as long half-life in blood, various effector functions and the like [Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications^ Wiley-Liss, Inc., Chapter 1 (1995)]. The human IgG class antibody is fiirther classified into the following 4 subclasses: IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. A large number of studies have so far been conducted for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity (hereinafter referred to as "ADCC activity") and complement-dependent cytotoxic activity (hereinafter referred to as "CDC activity") as effector fimctions of the IgG class antibody, and it has been reported that among antibodies of the human IgG class, the IgGl subclass has the highest ADCC activity and CDC activity [Chemical Immunology, 65, 88 (1997)]. In view of the above, most of the anti-tumor humanized antibodies, including commercially available Rituxan<br><br>
and Herceptin, which require high effector functions for the expression of their effects, are antibodies of the human IgGl subclass.<br>
Expression of ADCC activity and CDC activity of the human IgGl subclass antibodies requires binding of the Fc region of the antibody to an antibody receptor existing on the surface of an effector cell, such as a killer cell, a natural killer cell, an activated macrophage or the like (hereinafter referred to as "FcyR") and various complement components are bound. Regarding the binding, it has been suggested that several amino acid residues in the hinge region and the second domain of C region (hereinafter referred to as "CY2 domain") of the antibody are important [Eur. J. Immunol.^ 21, 1098 (1993), Immunology, 86, 319 (1995), Chemical Immunology, 65, 88 (1997)] and that a sugar chain binding to the Cy2 domain [Chemical Immunology, 65, 88 (1997)] is also important.<br>
Regarding the sugar chain, Boyd et aL have examined effects of a sugar chain on the ADCC activity and CDC activity by treating a human CDR-grafted antibody CAMPATH-IH (human IgGl subclass) produced by a Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO cell) or a mouse myeloma NSO cell (NSO cell) with various sugar hydrolyzing enzymes, and reported that elimination of the non-reducing end sialic acid did not have influence upon both activities, but the CDC activity alone was affected by further removal of galactose residue and about 50% of the activity was decreased, and that complete removal of the sugar chain caused disappearance of both activities [Molecular Immunol, yi, 1311 (1995)]. Also, Lifely et ah have analyzed the sugar chain bound to a human CDR-grafted antibody CAMPATH-IH (human IgGl subclass) which was produced by CHO cell, NSO cell or rat myeloma YO cell, measured its ADCC activity, and reported that the CAMPATH-IH derived from YO cell showed the highest ADCC activity, suggesting that iV'-acetylglucosamine (hereinafter referred also to as "GlcNAc") at the bisecting position is important for the activity [Glycobiology, 5, 813 (1995); WO 99/54342]. These reports indicate that the structure of the sugar chain plays an important role in the effector fimctions of himian antibodies of IgGl subclass and that it is possible to prepare an antibody having more higher effector ftmction by changing the structure of the sugar chain. However, actually, structures of sugar chains are various and complex, and it cannot be said that an actual important structure for the effector fiinction was identified.<br>
Sugar chains of glycoproteins are roughly divided into two types, namely a sugar chain which binds to asparagine (iV-glycoside-linked sugar chain) and a sugar chain which binds to other amino acid such as serine, threonine (O-glycoside-linked sugar chain), based on the binding form to the protein moiety. The iV-glycoside-linked sugar chains have various structures [Biochemical Experimentation Method 23 - Method for Studying<br><br>
Glycoprotein Sugar Chain (Gakujutsu Shuppan Center), edited by Reiko Takahashi (1989)], but it is known that they have a basic common core structure shown by the following structural formula (I).<br><br>
The sugar chain terminus which binds to asparagine is called a reducing end, and the opposite side is called a non-reducing end. It is known that the A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain includes a high mannose type in which mannose alone binds to the non-reducing end of the core structure; a complex type in which the non-reducing end side of the core structure has at least one parallel branches of galactose-A'-acetylglucosamine (hereinafter referred to as "Gal-GlcNAc") and the non-reducing end side of Gal-GlcNAc has a structure of sialic acid, bisecting A^-acetylglucosamine or the like; a hybrid type in which the non-reducing end side of the core structure has branches of both of the high mannose type and complex type; and the like.<br>
In the Fc region of an antibody of an IgG type, two A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain binding sites are present. In serum IgG, to the sugar chain binding site, generally, binds a complex type sugar chain having plural branches and in which addition of sialic acid or bisecting A'-acetylglucosamine is low. It is known that there is variety regarding the addition of galactose to the non-reducing end of the complex type sugar chain and the addition of fucose to the A'-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end [Biochemistry, 36. 130 (1997)].<br>
It has been considered that such a structure of a sugar chain is determined by sugar chain genes, namely a gene for a glycosyltransferase which synthesizes a sugar chain and a   gene for a glycolytic enzyme which hydrolyzes the sugar chain.<br>
Synthesis of an A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain is described below.<br>
Glycoproteins are modified with a sugar chain in the endoplasmic reticulum (hereinafter referred to as "ER") lumen. During the biosynthesis step of the TV-glycoside-linked sugar chain, a relatively large sugar chain is transferred to the polypeptide chain which is elongating in the ER limien. In the transformation, the sugar chain is firstly added in succession to phosphate groups of a long chain lipid carrier comprising about 20 a-isoprene units, which is called dolichol phosphate (hereinafter referred also to as "P-<br><br>
Dol"). That is, A^-acetylglucosamine is transferred to dolichol phosphate to thereby form GlcNAc-P-P-Dol and then one more GlcNAc is transferred to form GlcNAc-GlcNAc-P-P-Dol. Next, five mannoses (hereinafter mannose is also referred to as "Man") are transferred to thereby form (Man)5-(GicNAc)2-P-P-Dol and then four Man's and three glucoses (hereinafter glucose is also referred to as "Glc") are transferred. Thus, a sugar chain precursor, (Glc)3-(Man)9-(GlcNAc)2-P-P-Dol, called core oligosaccharide is formed. The sugar chain precursor comprising 14 sugars is transferred as a mass to a polypeptide having an asparagine-X-serine or asparagine-X-threonine sequence in the ER lumen. In the reaction, dolichol pyrophosphate (P-P-Dol) bound to the core oligosaccharide is released but again becomes dolichol phosphate by hydrolysis with pyrophosphatase and is recycled. Trimming of the sugar chain immediately starts after the sugar chain binds to the polypeptide. That is, 3 Glc's and 1 or 2 Man's are eliminated on the ER, and it is known that a-l,2"glucosidase I, a-l,3-glucosidase II and a-l,2-mannosidase relates to the elimination.<br>
The glycoprotein which was subjected to trimming on the ER is transferred to the Golgi body and are variously modified. In the cis part of the Golgi body, A^-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase which relates to addition of mannose phosphate, JV-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphodiester a-7V-acetylglucosaminidase and a-mannosidase I are present and reduce the Man residues to 5. In the medium part of the Golgi body, A^-acetylglucosamine transferase I (GnTI) which relates to addition of the first outside GlcNAc of the complex type iV-glycoside-linked sugar chain, a-mannosidase 11 which relates to elimination of 2 Man's, iV-acetylglucosamine transferase II (GnTII) which relates to addition of the second GlcNAc from the outside and a-l,6-fucosyltransferase which relates to addition of fucose to the reducing end iV-acetylglucosamine are present. In the trans part of the Golgi body, galactose transferase which relates to addition of galactose and sialyltransferase which relates to addition of sialic acid such as A'-acetylneuraminic acid or the like are present. It is known that A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain is formed by activities of these various enzymes.<br>
In general, most of the humanized antibodies of which application to medicaments is in consideration are prepared using genetic recombination techniques and produced using Chinese hamster ovary tissue-derived CHO cell as the host cell. But as described above, since the sugar chain structure plays a remarkably important role in the effector fimction of antibodies and differences are observed in the sugar chain structure of glycoproteins expressed by host cells, development of a host cell which can be used for the production of an antibody having higher effector fimction is desired.<br><br>
In order to modify the sugar chain structure of the produced glycoprotein, various methods have been attempted, such as 1) application of an inhibitor against an enzyme relating to the modification of a sugar chain, 2) selection of a mutant, 3) introduction of a gene encoding an enzyme relating to the modification of a sugar chain, and the like.    Specific examples are described below.<br>
Examples of an inhibitor against an enzyme relating to the modification of a sugar chain include tunicamycin which selectively inhibits formation of GlcNAc-P-P-Dol which is the first step of the formation of a core oligosaccharide which is a precursor of an iV-glycoside-linked sugar chain, castanospermin and iV-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin which are inhibitors of glycosidase I, bromocondulitol which is an inhibitor of glycosidase II, I -deoxynojirimycin and 1,4-dioxy-1,4-imino-D-mannitol which are inhibitors of marmosidase I, swainsonine which is an inhibitor of mannosidase II and the like. Examples of an inhibitor specific for a glycosyltransferase include deoxy derivatives of substrates against 7V-acetylglucosamine transferase V (GnTV) and the like [Glycobiology Series 2 - Destiny of Sugar Chain in Cell (Kodan-sha Scientific), edited by Katsutaka Nagai, Senichiro Hakomori and Akira Kobata (1993)]. Also, it is known that 1-deoxynojirimycin inhibits synthesis of a complex type sugar chain and increases the ratio of high mannose type and hybrid type sugar chains. Actually, it has been reported that sugar chain structure of IgG was changed and properties such as antigen binding activity and the like was changed when the inhibitors were added to a medium [Molecular /^wwwo/., 26, 1113(1989)].<br>
Mutants regarding the activity of an enzyme relating to the modification of a sugar chain are mainly selected and obtained as a lectin-resistant cell line. For example, CHO cell mutants having various sugar chain structures have been obtained as a lectin-resistant cell line using a lectin such as WGA (wheat-germ agglutinin derived from T. vulgaris)^ ConA (cocanavalin A derived from C ensiformis), RIC (a toxin derived from R. communis), L-PHA (leucoagglutinin derived fi"om P. vulgaris), LCA (lentil agglutinin derived fi"om L culinaris), PSA (pea lectin derived fi'om P. sativum) or the like [Somatic CellMol Genet.,]!, 51 (1986)].<br>
As an example of the modification of the sugar chain structure of a product obtained by introducing the gene of an enzyme relating to the modification of a sugar chain into a host cell, it has been reported that a protein in which a number of sialic acid is added to the non-reducing end of the sugar chain can be produced by introducing rat p-galactoside-a-2,6-sialyltransferase into CHO cell [J. Biol Chem., 261,13848 (1989)].<br>
Also, it was confirmed that an H antigen (Fucal-2Galpl-) in which fucose (hereinafter also referred to as "Fuc") was added to the non-reducing end of the sugar chain<br><br>
w^s expressed by introducing htiman p-gaiactoside-2-a-fucosyltransferase into mouse L cell [Science, 252. 1668 (1991)]. In addition, based on knowledge that addition of the bisecting-positioned iV-acetylglucosamine of JV-glycoside-linked sugar chain is important for the ADCC activity of antibody, Umana et al. have prepared CHO cell which expresses p-l,4-iV-acetylglucosamine transferase III (GnTIII) and compared it with the parent cell line on the expression of GnTIII. It was confinned that express of GnTIII was not observed in the parent cell line of CHO cell [J. Biol Chem., 261, 13370 (1984)], and that the antibody expressed using the produced GnTIII expressing CHO cell had ADCC activity 16 times higher than the antibody expressed using the parent cell line [Glycobiology, 5, 813 (1995): WO 99/54342]. At this time, Umana et al have also produced CHO cell into which p-l,4-Ar-acetylglucosamine transferase V (GnTV) was introduced and reported that excess expression of GnTIII or GnTV shows toxicity for CHO cell.<br>
pISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, in order to modify the sugar chain structure of the glycoprotein to be produced, control of the activity of the enzyme relating to the modification of a sugar chain in the host cell has been attempted, but actually, the structures of sugar chains are various and complex, and solution of the physiological roles of sugar chains would be insufficient, so that trial and error are repeated. Particularly, although it has been revealed little by little that the effector function of antibodies is greatly influenced by the sugar chain structure, a truly important sugar chain structure has not been specified yet. Accordingly, identification of a sugar chain which has influence upon the effector function of antibodies and development of a host cell to which such a sugar chain structure can be added are expected for developing medicaments.<br>

The Chinese hamster ovary tissue-derived CHO cell into which a gene encoding an antibody molecule is introduced according to the present invention may be any CHO cell, so long as it is a Chinese hamster ovary tissue-derived CHO cell into which a gene encoding an antibody molecule is introduced, which produces an antibody composition comprising complex A'-glycoside-linked sugar chains bound to the Fc region of an antibody molecule, wherein among the total complex A^-glycoside-Iinked sugar chains bound to the Fc region in the composition, the ratio of a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to A^-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chain is 20% or more.<br>
In the present invention, the antibody molecule includes any molecule, so long as it comprises the Fc region of an antibody. Examples include an antibody, an antibody fragment, a fusion protein comprising an Fc region, and the like.<br>
The antibody is a protein which is produced in the living body by immune reaction as a result of exogenous antigen stimulation and has an activity to specifically bind to the antigen.    Examples of the antibody include an antibody secreted by a<br><br>
hybridoma cell prepared from a spleen cell of an animal immunized with an antigen; an antibody prepared by a genetic recombination technique, namely an antibody obtained by introducing an antibody gene-inserted antibody expression vector into a host cell; and the like. Specific examples include an antibody produced by a hybridoma, a humanized antibody, a human antibody and the like.<br>
A hybridoma is a cell which is obtained by cell fusion between a B cell obtained by immunizing a mammal other than human with an antigen and a myeloma cell derived from mouse or the like and can produce a monoclonal antibody having the desired antigen specificity.<br>
Examples of the humanized antibody include a human chimeric antibody, a human CDR-grafted antibody and the like.<br>
A human chimeric antibody is an antibody which comprises an antibody heavy chain variable region (hereinafter referred to as "HV" or "VH", the heavy chain being "H chain") and an antibody light chain variable region (hereinafter referred to as "LV" or "VL", the light chain being "L chain"), both of an animal other than human, a human antibody heavy chain constant region (hereinafter also referred to as '*CH") and a human antibody light chain constant region (hereinafter also referred to as "CL"). As the animal other than human, any animal such as mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit or the like can be used, so long as a hybridoma can be prepared therefrom.<br>
The human chimeric antibody can be produced by obtaining cDNA's encoding VH and VL from a monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma, inserting them into an expression vector for host cell having genes encoding human antibody CH and human antibody CL to thereby construct a human chimeric antibody expression vector, and then introducing the vector into a host cell to express the antibody.<br>
As the CH of human chimeric antibody, any CH can be used, so long as it belongs to human immunoglobulin (hereinafter referred to as "hig") can be used. But those belonging to the hIgG class are preferable and any one of the subclasses belonging to the hIgG class, such as hlgGl, hIgG2, hIgG3 and hIgG4, can be used. Also, as the CL of human chimeric antibody, any CL can be used, so long as it belongs to the hig class, and tliose belonging to the K class or X class can also be used.<br>
A himian CDR-grafted antibody is an antibody in which amino acid sequences of CDR's of VH and VL of an antibody derived from an animal other than human are grafted into appropriate positions of VH and VL of a human antibody.<br>
The human CDR-grafted antibody can be produced by constructing cDNA's encoding V regions in which CDRs of VH and VL of an antibody derived from an animal other than human are grafted into CDR's of VH and VL of a human antibody, inserting<br><br>
them into an expression vector for host cell having genes encoding human antibody CH and human antibody CL to thereby construct a human CDR-grafted antibody expression vector, and then introducing the expression vector into a host cell to express the human CDR-grafted antibody.<br>
As the CH of human CDR-grafted antibody, any CH can be used, so long as it belongs to the hig, but those of the hIgG class are preferable and any one of the subclasses belonging to the hIgG class, such as hlgGl, hIgG2, hIgG3 and hIgG4, can be used. Also, as the CL of human CDR-grafted antibody, any CL can be used, so long as it belongs to the hIg class, and those belonging to the K class or X class can also be used.<br>
A human antibody is originally an antibody naturally existing in the human body, but it also includes antibodies obtained from a human antibody phage library, a human antibody-producing transgenic animal and a human antibody-producing transgenic plant, which are prepared based on the recent advance in genetic engineering, cell engineering and developmental engineering techniques.<br>
Regarding the antibody existing in the human body, a lymphocyte capable of producing the antibody can be cultured by isolating a human peripheral blood lymphocyte, immortalizing it by its infection with EB virus or the like and then cloning it, and the antibody can be purified from the culture.<br>
The human antibody phage library is a library in which antibody fragments such as Fab, single chain antibody and the like are expressed on the phage surface by inserting a gene encoding an antibody prepared from a human B cell into a phage gene. A phage expressing an antibody fragment having the desired antigen binding activity can be recovered from the library, using its activity to bind to an antigen-immobilized substrate as the marker. The antibody fragment can be converted fiirther into a human antibody molecule comprising two fiiU H chains and two fiiU L chains by genetic engineering techniques.<br>
A himian antibody-producing transgenic non-human animal is an animal in which a human antibody gene is introduced into cells. Specifically, a human antibody-producing transgenic animal can be prepared by introducing a human antibody gene into ES cell of a mouse, transplanting the ES cell into an early stage embryo of other mouse and then developing it. By introducing a human chimeric antibody gene into a fertilized egg and developing it, the transgenic animal can be also prepared. Regarding the preparation method of a human antibody from the human antibody-producing transgenic animal, the hxmian antibody can be produced and accumulated in a culture by obtaining a human antibody-producing hybridoma by a hybridoma preparation method usually carried out in mammals other than human and then culturing it.<br><br>
Examples of the transgenic non-human animal include cattle, sheep, goat, pig, horse, mouse, rat, fowl, monkey, rabbit and the like.<br>
Also, in the present invention, it is preferable that the antibody is an antibody which recognizes a tumor-related antigen, an antibody which recognizes an allergy- or inflammation-related antigen, an antibody which recognizes circulatory organ disease-related antigen, an antibody which recognizes an autoimmune disease-related antigen or an antibody which recognizes a viral or bacterial infection-related antigen, and a human antibody which belongs to the IgG class is preferable.<br>
An antibody fragment is a fragment which comprises the Fc region of an antibody. Examples of the antibody fragment include an H chain monomer, an H chain dimer and the like.<br>
A fusion protein comprising an Fc region is a composition in which an antibody comprising the Fc region of an antibody or the antibody fragment is fused with a protein such as an enzyme, a cytokine or the like.<br>
In the present invention, examples of the sugar chain which binds to the Fc region of an antibody molecule includes an 7V-glycoside-linked sugar chain. Examples of the A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain include a complex type in which the non-reducing end side of the core structure has one or plural parallel branches of galactose-A^-acetylglucosamine (hereinafter referred to as "Gal-GlcNAc") and the non-reducing end side of Gal-GlcNAc has a structure such as sialic acid, bisecting A^-acetylglucosamine or the like.<br>
In one antibody, the Fc region has positions to which an A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain is bound which will be described later. Accordingly, two sugar chains are bound per one antibody molecule. Since the A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain which binds to an antibody includes any sugar chain having the core structure represented by the structural formula (I), a number of combinations of sugar chains may possible for the two jV-glycoside-linked sugar chains which bind to the antibody. Accordingly, identity of substances can be judged from the viewpoint of the sugar structure bound to the Fc region.<br>
In the present invention, the composition which comprises an antibody molecule having complex A^-glycoside-linked sugar chains in the Fc region (hereinafter referred to as "the antibody composition of the present invention") may comprise an antibody having the same sugar chain structure or an antibody having different sugar chain structures, so long as the effect of the present invention is obtained from the composition.<br>
In the present invention, the ratio of a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to A^-acetyiglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chain among the total complex A/'-glycoside-linked sugar chains bound to the Fc region contained in the antibody<br><br>
composition is a ratio of the number of a sugar chain in which fiicose is not bound to A'-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chain to the total number of the complex A^-glycoside-linked sugar chains bound to the Fc region contained in the composition.<br>
In the present invention, the sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to jV-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the complex A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain is a sugar chain in which the fucose is not bound to A'^acetylglucosamine in the reducing end through a-bond in the complex A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain. Examples include a complex A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain in which 1-position of fucose is not bound to 6-position of A^acetylglucosamine through a-bond.<br>
The antibody composition shows high ADCC activity when the ratio of a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to A^-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chain among the total complex A^-glycoside-linked sugar chains binding to the Fc region contained in the antibody composition of the present invention is preferably 20% or more, more preferably 25% or more, still more preferably 30% or more, far preferably 40% or more, and most preferably 50% or more. As the antibody concentration is decreased, the ADCC activity is decreased, but high ADCC activity can be obtained even when the antibody concentration is low, so long as the ratio of a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to A^-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chain is 20% or more.<br>
The ratio of a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to A^-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chain contained in the composition which comprises an antibody molecule having complex A^-glycoside-linked sugar chains in the Fc region can be determined by releasing the sugar chain from the antibody molecule using a known method such as hydrazinolysis, enzyme digestion or the like [Biochemical Experimentation Methods 23 - Method for Studying Glycoprotein Sugar Chain (Japan Scientific Societies Press), edited by Reiko Takahashi (1989)], carrying out fluorescence labeling or radioisotope labeling of the released sugar chain and then separating the labeled sugar chain by chromatography. Also, the released sugar chain can also be determined by analyzing it with the HPAED-PAD method [J. Liq, Chromatogr., 6,1557 (1983)].<br>

The enzymes catalyze specific reactions having substrate specificity, and dominant negative mutants of the enzymes can be prepared by disrupting the active center of the enzymes which catalyze the catalytic activity having substrate specificity. The method for preparing a dominant negative mutant is specifically described as follows with reference to GMD among the target enzymes.<br>
As a result of the analysis of the three-dimensional structure ofE. co//-derived GMD, it has been revealed that 4 amino acids (threonine at position 133, glutamic acid at position 135, tyrosine at position 157 and lysine at position 161) have an important function on the enzyme activity (Structure, 8, 2, 2000). That is, when mutants were prepared by substituting the 4 amino acids with other different amino acids based on the three-dimensional structure information, the enzyme activity of all of the mutants was<br><br>
significantly decreased. On the other hand, changes in the ability of GMD to bind to GMD coenzyme NADP and its substrate GDP-mannose were hardly observed in the mutants. Accordingly, a dominant negative mutant can be prepared by substituting the 4 amino acids which control the enzyme activity of GMD. For example, in GMD (SEQ ID NO:65) derived from CHO cell, a dominant negative mutant can be prepared by substituting threonine position 155, glutamic acid at position 157, tyrosine at position 179 and lysine at position 183 with other amino acids, by comparing the homology and predicting the three-dimensional structure using the amino acid sequence information based on the results of the E. co//-derived GMD.

If necessary, an antibiotic such as ampicillin, tetracycline or the like may be added to the medium during the culturing.<br>
When a microorganism transformed with a recombinant vector obtained using an inducible promoter as the promoter is cultured, an inducer may be added to the medium, if necessary.

As the method for expressing the gene, secretion production, expression of a fusion protein and the like can be carried out in accordance with the method described in Molecular Cloning, Second Edition, in addition to the direct expression.<br>
Examples of the process for producing an antibody composition include a method of intracellular expression in a host cell, a method of extracellular secretion from a host cell, and a method of production on a host cell membrane outer envelope. The method can be selected by changing the host cell used or the structure of the antibody composition produced.<br>
When the antibody composition of the present invention is produced in a host cell or on a host cell membrane outer envelope, it can be positively secreted extracellularly in accordance with the method of Paulson et aL [J. Biol Chem., 264, 17619 (1989)], the method of Lowe et aL [Proc. Natl Acad Scl USA, 86. 8227 (1989), Genes Develop,, 4, 1288 (1990)], the methods described in Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 336963/93 and Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 823021/94 and the like.<br>
That is, an antibody molecule of interest can be positively secreted extracellularly from a host cell by inserting a DNA encoding the antibody molecule and a DNA encoding a signal peptide suitable for the expression of the antibody molecule into an expression vector using a gene recombination technique, introducing the expression vector into the host cell and then expressing the antibody molecule.<br>
Also, its production amount can be increased in accordance with the method described in Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 227075/90 using a gene amplification system using a dihydrofolate reductase gene.<br>
In addition, the antibody composition can also be produced using a gene-introduced animal  individual  (transgenic non-human animal) or a plant individual<br><br>
(transgenic plant) which is constructed by the redifferentiation of an animal or plant cell into which the gene is introduced.<br>
When the transformant is an animal individual or a plant individual, an antibody composition can be produced in accordance with a general method by rearing or cultivating it to thereby produce and accumulate the antibody composition and then recovering the antibody composition from the animal or plant individual.<br>
Examples of the process for producing an antibody composition using an animal individual include a method in which the antibody composition of interest is produced in an animal constructed by introducing a gene in accordance with a known method [American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 63, 627S (1996); Bio/Technology^ 9, 830 (1991)].<br>
In the case of an animal individual, an antibody composition can be produced by rearing a transgenic non-human animal into which a DNA encoding an antibody molecule is introduced to thereby produce and accumulate the antibody composition in the animal, and then recovering the antibody composition from the animal. Examples of the place of the animal where the composition is produced and accumulated include milk (Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 309192/88) and eggs of the animal. As the promoter used in this case, any promoter can be used, so long as it can function in an animal. Preferred examples include mammary gland cell-specific promoters such as a casein promoter, p casein promoter, p lactoglobulin promoter, whey acidic protein promoter and the like.<br>
Example of the process for producing an antibody composition using a plant individual include a method in which an antibody composition is produced by cultivating a transgenic plant into which a DNA encoding an antibody molecule is introduced by a known method [Tissue Culture, 20 (1994); Tissue Culture, 21 (1995); Trends in Biotechnology, 15, 45 (1997)] to produce and accumulate the antibody composition in the plant, and then recovering the antibody composition from the plant.<br>
Regarding purification of an antibody composition produced by a transformant into which a gene encoding an antibody molecule is introduced, for example, when the antibody composition is intracellularly expressed in a dissolved state, the cells after culturing are recovered by centrifugation, suspended in an aqueous buffer and then disrupted using ultrasonic oscillator, French press, Manton Gaulin homogenizer, dynomill or the like to obtain a cell-free extract. A purified product of the antibody composition can be obtained from a supernatant obtained by centrifiiging the cell-free extract, by using a general enzyme isolation purification techniques such as solvent extraction; salting out; desalting with ammonium sulfate, etc.; precipitation with an organic solvent; anion<br><br>
exchange chromatography using a resin such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose, DIAION HPA-75 (manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical), etc.; cation exchange chromatography using a resin such as S-Sepharose FF (manufactured by Pharmacia), etc; hydrophobic chromatography using a resin such as butyl-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, etc.; gel filtration using a molecular sieve; affinity chromatography; chromatofocusing; electrophoresis such as isoelectric focusing, etc.; and the like which may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Also, when the antibody composition is expressed intracellularly by forming an insoluble body, the cells are recovered, disrupted and centrifuged in the same manner, and the insoluble body of the antibody composition is recovered as a precipitation fraction. The recovered insoluble body of the antibody composition is solubilized using a protein denaturing agent. The antibody composition is made into a normal three-dimensional structure by diluting or dialyzing the solubilized solution, and then a purified product of the antibody composition is obtained by the same isolation purification method.<br>
When the antibody composition is secreted extracellularly, the antibody composition or derivatives thereof can be recovered from the culture supernatant. That is, the culture is treated by a technique such as centrifugation or the like to obtain a soluble fraction, and a purified preparation of the antibody composition can be obtained from the soluble fraction by the same isolation purification method.<br>
Examples of the thus obtained antibody composition include an antibody, the fragment of the antibody, a fusion protein comprising the Fc region of the antibody, and the like.<br>
As an example for obtaining the antibody composition, a process for producing a composition of a humanized antibody is described below in detail, but other antibody compositions can also be obtained in a manner similar to the method.<br>

Biochem., 101, 1307 (1987)], pHSG274 [Gene, Tl, 223 (1984)], pKCR [Proc, Natl Acad Scl USA, 78, 1527 (1981), pSGl (3 d2-4 [Cytotechnology, 4, 173 (1990)] and the like. Examples of the promoter and enhancer in the expression vector for animal cell include SV40 early promoter and enhancer [J. Biochem., lOL 1307 (1987)], Moloney mouse leukemia virus LTR promoter [Biochem. Biophys. Res, Commun., 149, 960 (1987)], immunoglobulin H chain promoter [Cell, 41, 479 (1985)] and enhancer [Cell, 33, 717 (1983)], and the like.<br>
The humanized antibody expression vector may be either of a type in which genes encoding the H chain and L chain of an antibody exist on separate vectors or of a type in which both genes exist on the same vector (tandem type). In respect of easiness of construction of a humanized antibody expression vector, easiness of introduction into animal cells, and balance between the expression amounts of the H and L chains of an antibody in animal cells, a tandem type of the humanized antibody expression vector is more preferred [J. Immunol. Methods, 167, 271 (1994)].<br>
The constructed hxmianized antibody expression vector can be used for expression of a human chimeric antibody and a human CDR-grafted antibody in animal cells.<br>
(2) Preparation of cDNA encoding V region of antibody derived from animal other than human<br>
cDNAs encoding the H chain and L chain V regions of an antibody derived from an animal other than human, such as a mouse antibody, can be obtained in the following manner.<br>
A cDNA is synthesized by extracting mRNA from a hybridoma cell which produces the mouse antibody of interest. The synthesized cDNA is cloned into a vector such as a phage or a plasmid to obtain a cDNA library. Each of a recombinant phage or recombinant plasmid comprising a cDNA encoding the H chain V region and a recombinant phage or recombinant plasmid comprising a cDNA encoding the L chain V region is isolated from the library using a C region part or a V region part of an existing mouse antibody as the probe.   Full nucleotide sequences of the H chain and L chain V<br><br>
regions of the mouse antibody of interest on the recombinant phage or recombinant plasmid are determined, and full amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions are deduced from the nucleotide sequences.<br>
As the animal other than human, any animal such as mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit or the like can be used so long as a hybridoma cell can be produced therefrom.<br>
Examples of the method for preparing total RNA from a hybridoma cell include the guanidine thiocyanate-cesium trifluoroacetate method [Methods in Enzymology, ^54, 3 (1987)] and the like, and examples of the method for preparing mRNA from total RNA, an oligo(dT)-inimobilized cellulose column method (Molecular Cloning, Second Edition) and the like. In addition, examples of a kit for preparing mRNA from a hybridoma cell include Fast Track mRNA Isolation Kit (manufactured by Invitrogen), Quick Prep mRNA Purification Kit (manufactured by Pharmacia) and the like.<br>
Examples of the method for synthesizing cDNA and preparing a cDNA library include the usual methods (Molecular Clonings Second Edition, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Supplement 1-34), methods using a commercially available kit such as Superscript , Plasmid System for cDNA Synthesis and Plasmid Cloning (manufactured by GIBCO BRL) or ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (manufactured by Stratagene), and the like.<br>
In preparing the cDNA library, the vector into which a cDNA synthesized using mRNA extracted from a hybridoma cell as the template is inserted may be any vector so long as the cDNA can be inserted. Examples include ZAP Express [Strategies, 5, 58 (1992)], pBluescript II SK(+) [Nucleic Acids Research, JJ, 9494 (1989)], A^zapII (manufactured by Stratagene), X,gtlO and Xgtll [DNA Cloning, A Practical Approach, I, 49 (1985)], Lambda BlueMid (manufactured by Clontech), JiExCell, pT7T3 18U (manufactured by Pharmacia), pcD2 [MoL Cell. Biol, 3, 280 (1983)], pUC18 [Gene, 33, 103 (1985)] and the like.<br>
As Escherichia coli into which the cDNA library constructed from a phage or plasmid vector is introduced, any Escherichia coli can be used, so long as the cDNA library can be introduced, expressed and maintained. Examples include XL 1-Blue MRF' [Strategies, 5, 81 (1992)], C600 [Genetics, 39, 440 (1954)], Y1088 and Y1090 [Science, 111, 1J% (1983)], NM522 [J. Mol Biol, 166, 1 (1983)], K802 [J. Mol Biol, \6, 118 (1966)], JM105 [Gene, 38,275 (1985)] and the like.<br>
As the method for selecting a cDNA clone encoding the H chain and L chain V regions of an antibody derived from an animal other than human from the cDNA library, a colony hybridization or a plaque hybridization using an isotope- or fluorescence-labeled probe can be used (Molecular Cloning, Second Edition). The cDNA encoding the H chain and L chain V regions can also be prepared by preparing primers and carrying out<br><br>
polymerase chain reaction (hereinafter referred to as "PCR"; Molecular Cloning, Second Edition; Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Supplement 1-34) using a cDNA synthesized from mRNA or a cDNA library as the template.<br>
The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs can be determined by digesting the selected cDNAs with appropriate restriction enzymes, cloning the fragments into a plasmid such as pBluescript SK(-) (manufactured by Stratagene) or the like, carrying out the reaction of a generally used nucleotide sequence analyzing method such as the dideoxy method [Proc, Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 74, 5463 (1977)] of Sanger et al or the like and then analyzing the clones using an automatic nucleotide sequence analyzer such as A.L.F. DNA Sequencer (manufactured by Pharmacia) or the like. Whether or not the obtained cDNAs are encoding the fiiU amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of the antibody containing a secretory signal sequence can be confirmed by deducing the fiiU amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions from the determined nucleotide sequence and comparing them with the frill amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of known antibodies [Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Dep. Health and Human Services (1991)].<br>
(3)	Analysis of amino acid sequence of V region of antibody derived from animal other<br>
than human<br>
Regarding the frill amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of the antibody containing a secretory signal sequence, the length of the secretory signal sequence and the A^-terminal amino acid sequences can be deduced and subgroups to which they belong can also be found, by comparing them with the frill amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of known antibodies [Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Dep. Health and Human Services, (1991)]. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of each CDR can also be found by comparing them with the amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of known antibodies [Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Dep. Health and Human Services, (1991)].<br>
(4)	Construction of human chimeric antibody expression vector<br>
A human chimeric antibody expression vector can be constructed by cloning cDNAs encoding the H chain and L chain V regions of an antibody derived from an animal other than human into upstream of genes encoding the H chain and L chain C regions of a human antibody in the vector for humanized antibody expression constructed in the item 3(1).   For example, a human chimeric antibody expression vector can be constructed by<br><br>
linking each of cDNAs encoding the H chain and L chain V regions of an antibody derived from an animal other than human to a synthetic DNA comprising nucleotide sequences at the 3'-terminals of the H chain and L chain V regions of an antibody derived from an animal other than human and nucleotide sequences at the 5'-terminals of the H chain and L chain C regions of a human antibody and also having a recognition sequence of an appropriate restriction enzyme at both terminals, and by cloning them into upstream of genes encoding the H chain and L chain C regions of a human antibody contained in the vector for humanized antibody expression constructed described in the item 3(1).<br>
(5) Construction of cDNA encoding V region of human CDR-grafted antibody<br>
cDNAs encoding the H chain and L chain V regions of a himian CDR-grafted antibody can be obtained as follows. First, amino acid sequences of the frameworks (hereinafter referred to as "FR") of the H chain and L chain V regions of a human antibody for grafting CDR of the H chain and L chain V regions of an antibody derived from an animal other than human is selected. As the amino acid sequences of FRs of the H chain and L chain V regions of a human antibody, any amino acid sequences can be used so long as they are derived from a human antibody. Examples include amino acid sequences of FRs of the H chain and L chain V regions of human antibodies registered at databases such as Protein Data Bank, etc., amino acid sequences common in each subgroup of FRs of the H chain and L chain V regions of human antibodies [Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Dep. Health and Human Services (1991)] and the like. But in order to produce a human CDR-grafted antibody having potent activity, it is preferable to select an amino acid sequence having a homology as high as possible (at least 60% or more) with amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of an antibody of interest derived from an animal other than human.<br>
Next, the amino acid sequences of CDRs of the H chain and L chain V regions of the antibody of interest derived from an animal other than human are grafted to the selected amino acid sequences of FRs of the H chain and L chain V regions of a human antibody to design amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of the human CDR-grafted antibody. The designed amino acid sequences are converted into DNA sequences by considering the frequency of codon usage foimd in nucleotide sequences of antibody genes [Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Dep. Health and Human Services (1991)], and the DNA sequences encoding the amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of the human CDR-grafted antibody are designed. Based on the designed DNA sequences, several synthetic DNA fragments having a length of about 100 bases are synthesized, and PCR is carried out using them.   In<br><br>
this case, it is preferable in each of the H chain and the L chain that 6 synthetic DNAs are designed in view of the reaction efficiency of PCR and the lengths of DNAs which can be synthesized.<br>
Also, they can be easily cloned into the vector for humanized antibody expression constructed in the item 3(1) by introducing recognition sequences of an appropriate restriction enzyme into the 5'-terminals of the synthetic DNA present on both terminals. After the PCR, the amplified product is cloned into a plasmid such as pBluescript SK(-) (manufactured by Stratagene) or the like and the nucleotide sequences are determined by the method in the item 3(2) to thereby obtain a plasmid having DNA sequences encoding the amino acid sequences of the H chain and L chain V regions of the desired human CDR-grafted antibody.<br>
(6)	Construction of human CDR-grafted antibody expression vector<br>
A human CDR-grafted antibody expression vector can be constructed by cloning the cDNAs encoding the H chain and L chain V regions of the human CDR-grafted antibody constructed in the item 3(5) into upstream of the gene encoding H chain and L chain C regions of a hxunan antibody in the vector for humanized antibody expression described in the item 3(1). For example, the human CDR-grafted antibody expression vector can be constructed by introducing recognizing sequences of an appropriate restriction enzyme into the 5'-terminals of both terminals of a synthetic DNA fragment, among the synthetic DNA fragments which are used when PCR is carried out in the item 3(5) for constructing the H chain and L chain V regions of the human CDR-grafted antibody, so that they are cloned into upstream of the genes encoding the H chain and L chain C regions of a human antibody in the vector for humanized antibody expression described in the item 3(1) in such a maimer that they can be expressed in a suitable form.<br>
(7)	Stable production of humanized antibody<br>
A transformant capable of stably producing a human chimeric antibody and a human CDR-grafted antibody (both hereinafter referred to as "humanized antibody") can be obtained by introducing the himianized antibody expression vectors described in the items 3(4) and (6) into an appropriate animal cell.<br>
Examples of the method for introducing a humanized antibody expression vector into an animal cell include electroporation [Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 257891/90, Cytotechnology, 3,133 (1990)] and the like.<br><br>
As the animal cell into which a humanized antibody expression vector is introduced, any cell can be used so long as it is an animal cell which can produce the humanized antibody.<br>
Examples include mouse myeloma cells such as NSO cell and SP2/0 cell, Chinese hamster ovary cells such as CHO/dhfr" cell and CHO/DG44 cell, rat myeloma such as YB2/0 cell and IR983F cell, BHK cell derived from a syrian hamster kidney, a human myeloma cell such as Namalwa cell, and the like, and a Chinese hamster ovary cell CHO/DG44 cell, a rat myeloma YB2/0 cell and the host cells of the present invention described in the item 5 are preferred.<br>
After introduction of the humanized antibody expression vector, a transformant capable of stably producing the humanized antibody can be selected using a medium for animal cell culture comprising an agent such as G418 sulfate (hereinafter referred to as "G418"; manufactured by SIGMA) and the like in accordance with the method disclosed in Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 257891/90. Examples of the medium for animal cell culture include RPMI 1640 medium (manufactured by Nissui Pharmaceutical), GIT medium (manufactured by Nihon Pharmaceutical), EX-CELL 302 medium (manufactured by JRH), IMDM medium (manufactured by GIBCO BRL), Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by GIBCO BRL) media obtained by adding various additives such as fetal bovine serum (hereinafter referred to as "FBS") to these media, and the like. The humanized antibody can be produced and accumulated in the culture supernatant by culturing the obtained transformant in a mediimi. The expression level and antigen binding activity of the humanized antibody in the culture supematant can be measured by a method such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [hereinafter referred to as "ELISA"; Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual^ Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Chapter 14 (1998), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press Limited (1996)] or the like. Also, the expression level of the humanized antibody by the transformant can be increased using a DHFR gene amplification system in accordance with the method disclosed in Japanese Published Examined Patent Application No. 257891/90.<br>
The humanized antibody can be purified from a culture supematant of the transformant using a protein A column [Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Chapter 8 (1988), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press Limited (1996)]. In addition, purification methods generally used for the purification of proteins can also be used. For example, the purification can be carried out through the combination of a gel filtration, an ion exchange chromatography and an ultrafiltration. The molecular weight of the H chain, L chain or antibody molecule as a whole of the purified humanized antibody can be measured, e.g., by polyacrylamide gel<br><br>
ilectrophoresis [hereinafter referred to as '*SDS-PAGE"; Nature, 231^ 680 (1970)], Vestem blotting [Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, ];hapter 12, (1988), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press limited (1996)] or the like.<br>
Thus, methods for producing an antibody composition using an animal cell as he host have been described, but, as described above, the antibody composition can also &gt;e produced by a yeast, an insect cell, a plant cell, an animal individual or a plant ndividual by the same methods on the animal cell.<br>
When a host cell has the ability to express an antibody molecule innately, the intibody composition of the present invention can be produced by preparing a cell ixpressing an antibody molecule using the method described in the item 1, culturing the ell and then purifying the antibody composition of interest from the resulting culture.<br>
L Activity evaluation of antibody composition<br>
As the method for measuring the amount of the purified antibody composition, he activity to bind to an antibody and the effector function of the purified antibody omposition, the known method described in Monoclonal Antibodies, Antibody Ingineering and the like can be used.<br>
As the examples, when the antibody composition is a humanized antibody, the ►inding activity with an antigen and the binding activity with an antigen-positive cultured ell line can be measured by methods such as ELISA, an immunofluorescent method Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 36, 373 (1993)] and the like. The cytotoxic activity gainst an antigen-positive cultured cell line can be evaluated by measuring CDC activity, ^DCC activity [Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 36,373 (1993)] and the like.<br>
Also, safety and therapeutic effect of the antibody composition in human can ►e evaluated using an appropriate model of animal species relatively close to human, such s Macacafascicularis or the like.<br>
. Analysis of sugar chains binding to antibody molecules expressed in various cells<br>
The sugar chain structure binding to an antibody molecule expressed in various cells can be analyzed in accordance with the general analysis of the sugar chain structure of a glycoprotein. For example, the sugar chain which is bound to IgG molecule comprises a neutral sugar such as galactose, mannose, fucose or the like, an amino sugar such as A/-acetylglucosamine or the like and an acidic sugar such as sialic acid or the like, and can be analyzed by a method such as a sugar chain structure analysis or the like using sugar composition analysis, two dimensional sugar chain mapping or the like.<br><br>
(1)	Analysis of neutral sugar and amino sugar compositions<br>
The sugar chain composition binding to an antibody molecule can be analyzed by carrying out acid hydrolysis of sugar chains with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or the like to release a neutral sugar or an amino sugar and measuring the composition ratio.<br>
Example include a method using a sugar composition analyzer (BioLC) manufactured by Dionex. The BioLC is an apparatus which analyzes a sugar composition by HPAEC-PAD (high performance anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection) [J. Liq. Chromatogr., 6,1577 (1983)].<br>
The composition ratio can also be analyzed by a fluorescence labeling method using 2-aminopyridine. Specifically, the compositional ratio can be calculated in accordance with a known method [Agric. Biol. Chem,, 55(1). 283-284 (1991)], by labeling an acid-hydrolyzed sample with a fluorescence with 2-aminopyridylation and then analyzing the composition by HPLC.<br>
(2)	Analysis of sugar chain structure<br>
The sugar chain structure binding to an antibody molecule can be analyzed by the two dimensional sugar chain mapping method [Anal Biochem., 171, 73 (1988), Biochemical Experimentation Methods 23 - Methods for Studying Glycoprotein Sugar Chains (Japan Scientific Societies Press) edited by Reiko Takahashi (1989)]. The two dimensional sugar chain mapping method is a method for deducing a sugar chain structure by, e.g., plotting the retention time or elution position of a sugar chain by reverse phase chromatography as the X axis and the retention time or elution position of the sugar chain by normal phase chromatography as the Y axis, respectively, and comparing them with such results of known sugar chains.<br>
Specifically, sugar chains are released from an antibody by subjecting the antibody to hydrazinolysis, and the released sugar chain is subjected to fluorescence labeling with 2-aminopyridine (hereinafter referred to as "PA") [J. Biochem., 95, 197 (1984)], and then the sugar chains are separated from an excess PA-treating reagent by gel filtration, and subjected to reverse phase chromatography. Thereafter, each peak of the separated sugar chains are subjected to normal phase chromatography. The sugar chain structure can be deduced by plotting the results on a two dimensional sugar chain map and comparing them with the spots of a sugar chain standard (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) or a literature [Anal Biochem., 171, 73 (1988)].<br><br>
The structure deduced by the two dimensional sugar chain mapping method can be confirmed by further carrying out mass spectrometry such as MALDI-TOF-MS of each sugar chain or the like.<br>
6. Immunological determination method for discriminating sugar chain structure of antibody molecule<br>
An antibody composition comprises an antibody molecule in which sugar chains binding to the Fc region of the antibody are different in structure. The antibody composition in which the ratio of a sugar chain in which fucose is not bound to A^-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the sugar chain is 20% or more among the total complex iV-glycoside-linked sugar chains binding to the Fc region in the antibody composition reducing end has potent ADCC activity. The antibody composition can be identified by using the method for analyzing the sugar chain structure of an antibody molecule described in the item 6. Also, it can also be identified by an Immunological determination method using a lectin.<br>
The sugar chain structure of an antibody molecule can be identified by the Immxmological determination method using a lectin in accordance with the known Immunological determination method such as Western staining, IRA (radioimmunoassay), VIA (viroimmunoassay), EIA (enzymoimmxmoassay), FIA (fluoroimmunoassay), MIA (metalloimmunoassay) and the like described in Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications, Wiley-Liss, Inc. (1995); Immunoassay, 3rd Ed., Igakushoin (1987); Enzyme Antibody Method, Revised Edition, Gakusai Kikaku (1985); and the like.<br>
A lectin which recognizes the sugar chain structure of an antibody molecule comprised in an antibody composition is labeled, and the labeled lectin is allowed to react with an antibody composition which is a sample. Then, the amount of the complex of the labeled lectin with the antibody molecule is measured.<br>
Examples of the lectin used for identifying the sugar chain structure of an antibody molecule include WGA (wheat-germ agglutinin derived from T, vulgaris), ConA (cocanavalin A derived fi"om C ensiformis), RIC (a toxin derived from R. communis), L-PHA (leucoagglutinin derived from P. vulgaris), LCA (lentil agglutinin derived from L culinaris), PSA (pea lectin derived from P. sativum), AAL (Aleuria aurantia lectin), ACL {Amaranthus caudatus lectin), BPL {Bauhinia purpurea lectin), DSL (Datura stramonium lectin), DBA (Dolichos biflorus agglutinin), EBL (elderberry balk lectin)^ ECL {Erythrina cristagalU lectin), EEL (Euonymus eoropaeus lectin), GNL {Galanthus nivalis lectin), GSL {Griffonia simplicifolia lectin), HPA (Helix pomatia agglutinin), HHL (Hippeastrum   hybrid   lectin),   Jacalin,   LTL   (Lotus   tetragonolobus   lectin),   LEL<br><br>
{Lycopersicon esculentum lectin), MAL (Maackia amurensis lectin), MPL {Madura pomifera lectin), NPL {Narcissus pseudonarcissus lectin), PNA (peanut agglutinin), E-PHA {Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin), PTL {Psophocarpus tetragonolobus lectin), RCA {Ricinus communis agglutinin), STL {Solarium tuberosum lectin), SJA {Sophora japonica agglutinin), SB A (soybean agglutinin), UEA {Ulex europaeus agglutinin), VVL {Vicia villosa lectin) and WFA {Wisteriafloribunda agglutinin).<br>
It is preferable to use a lectin which specifically recognizes a sugar chain structure wherein fiicose binds to the iV-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end in the complex iV-glycoside-linked sugar chain. Examples include Lens culinaris lectin LCA (lentil agglutinin derived from Lens culinaris), pea lectin PSA (pea lectin derived from Pisum sativum), broad bean lectin VFA (agglutinin derived from Vicia faba) and Aleuria aurantia lectin AAL (lectin derived from Aleuria aurantia).<br>
7. Application of antibody molecule of the present invention<br>
The antibody composition of the present invention has potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity. An antibody having potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity is useftil for preventing and treating various diseases including cancers, inflammatory diseases, immune diseases such as autoimmune diseases, allergies and the like, circulatory organ diseases and viral or bacterial infections.<br>
In the case of cancers, namely malignant tumors, cancer cells grow. General anti-tumor agents inhibit the growth of cancer cells. In contrast, an antibody having potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity can treat cancers by injuring cancer cells through its cell killing effect, and therefore, it is more effective as a therapeutic agent than the general anti-tumor agents. At present, in the therapeutic agent for cancers, an anti-tumor effect of an antibody medicament alone is insufficient so that combination therapy with chemotherapy has been carried out [Science, 280, 1197 (1998)]. If more potent anti-tumor effect is found by the antibody composition of the present invention alone, the dependency on chemotherapy will be decreased and side effects will be reduced.<br>
In immune diseases such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, allergies and the like, in vivo reactions of the diseases are induced by the release of a mediator molecule by immunocytes, so that the allergy reaction can be inhibited by eliminating immimocytes using an antibody having potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity.<br>
Examples of the circulatory organ diseases include arteriosclerosis and the like. The arteriosclerosis is treated using balloon catheter at present, but circulatory organ<br><br>
diseases can be prevented and treated by inhibiting growth of arterial cells in restricture after treatment using an antibody having potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity.<br>
Various diseases including viral and bacterial infections can be prevented and treated by inhibiting proliferation of cells infected with a virus or bacterium using an antibody having potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity.<br>

Example 2<br>
Activity evaluation of anti-GD3 chimeric antibody:<br>

Fig. 2 shows a result of the examination of the binding activity measured by changing the concentration of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibody to be added. As shown in Fig. 2, the five kinds of the anti"GD3 chimeric antibodies showed almost the same binding activity to GD3. The result shows that antigen binding activities of these antibodies are constant independently of the antibody-producing animal cells and their culturing methods. Also, it was suggested from the comparison of the NS0-GD3 chimeric antibody (302) with the NSO-GD3 chimeric antibody (GIT) that the antigen binding activities are constant independently of the media used in the culturing.<br>
2.	In vitro cytotoxic activity (ADCC activity) of anti-GD3 chimeric antibody<br>
In order to evaluate in vitro cytotoxic activity of the five kinds of the purified anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies obtained in the item 4 of Example 1, the ADCC activity was measured in accordance with the following method.<br>
(1)	Preparation of target cell solution<br>
A human melanoma cultured cell line G-361 (ATCC CRL 1424) was cultured using the RPMI1640-FBS(10) medium to prepare 1x10^ cells, and the cells were radioisotope-labeled by reacting them with 3.7 MBq equivalents of a radioactive substance Na2^^Cr04 at 37°C for 1 hour. After the reaction, the cells were washed three times through their suspension in the RPMI1640-FBS(10) medium and centrifugation, re-suspended in the medium and then incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes in ice for spontaneous dissolution of the radioactive substance. After centrifiigation, the precipitate was adjusted to 2x10^ cells/ml by adding 5 ml of the RPMI1640-FBS(10) medium and used as the target cell solution.<br>
(2)	Preparation of effector cell solution<br>
From a healthy person, 50 ml of venous blood was collected, and gently mixed with 0.5 ml of heparin sodium (manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceutical). The mixture was centrifiiged to isolate a mononuclear cell layer using Lymphoprep (manufactured by Nycomed Pharma AS) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions.   After washing<br><br>
with the RPMI1640-FBS(10) medium by centrifugation three times, the resuhing precipitate was re-suspended to give a density of 2x10^ cells/ml using the medium and used as the effector cell solution.<br>
(3) Measurement of ADCC activity<br>
Into each well of a 96 well U-shaped bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon), 50 |j,l of the target cell solution prepared in the above (l)(lxlO'^ cells/well) was dispensed. Next, 100 |il of the effector cell solution prepared in the above (2) was added thereto (2x10^ cells/well, the ratio of effector cells to target cells becomes 20:1). Subsequently, each of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies was added to give a final concentration from 0.0025 to 2.5 p-g/ml, followed by reaction at 37*^0 for 4 hours. After the reaction, the plate was centrifuged, and the amount of ^^Cr in the supernatant was measured using a y-counter. The amount of spontaneously released ^^Cr was calculated by the same operation using only the medium instead of the effector cell solution and the antibody solution, and measuring the amount of ^^Cr in the supernatant. The amount of total released ^^Cr was calculated by the same operation using only the medium instead of the antibody solution and adding 1 N hydrochloric acid instead of the effector cell solution, and measuring the amount of ^*Cr in the supernatant. The ADCC activity was calculated from the following equation (II):<br><br>
The results are shown in Fig. 3, As shown in Fig. 3, among the five kinds of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies, the YB2/0-GD3 chimeric antibody showed the most potent ADCC activity, followed by the SP2/0-GD3 chimeric antibody, NS0-GD3 chimeric antibody and CH0-GD3 chimeric antibody in that order. No difference in the ADCC activity was found between the NS0-GD3 chimeric antibody (302) and NS0-GD3 chimeric antibody (GIT) prepared using different media in the culturing. The above results show that the ADCC activity of antibodies greatly varies depending on the kind of the animal cells to be used in their production. As its mechanism, since their antigen binding activities were identical, it was considered that it is caused by a difference in the structure binding to the antibody Fc region.<br><br>

Similar to the result of the item 2 of Example 2, the above results show that the ADCC activity of antibodies greatly varies depending on the animal cells to be used in their production. In addition, since the antibodies produced by the YB2/0 cell showed the most potent ADCC activity in both cases of the two kinds of the humanized antibodies, it was revealed that an antibody having potent ADCC activity can be produced by using the YB2/0 cell.<br>
3. In vivo activity evaluation of anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody<br>
In order to evaluate in vivo activity of the three kinds of the purified anti-hlL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibodies obtained in the item 3 of Example 3, the inhibition activity in an hIL-5-induced eosinophilia increasing model oi Macaca faseicularis was examined in accordance with the following method.<br>
The hIL-5 (preparation method is described in WO 97/10354) was administered to Macaca faseicularis under the dorsal skin at a dose of 1 |4.g/kg, starting on the first day and once a day for a total of 14 times. Each anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody was intravenously administered at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg one hour before the hIL-5 administration on the day zero. An antibody-non-added group was used as the control. In the antibody-administered groups, three animals oi Macaca faseicularis were used in each group (No. 301, No. 302, No. 303, No. 401, No. 402, No, 403, No. 501, No. 502 and No. 503), and two animals (No. 101 and No. 102) were used in the antibody-non-added group. Starting 7 days before commencement of the administration and imtil 42 days after the administration, about 1 ml of blood was periodically collected from a saphena or a femoral vein, and the number of eosinophils in 1 yl of peripheral blood was measured. The results are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7, increase in the blood eosinophil was completely inhibited in the group to which the YB2/0-hIL-5R CDR antibody was administered. On the other hand, complete inhibition activity was found in one animal in the group to which the CH0/d-hIL-5R CDR antibody was administered, but the inhibition activity was not sufficient in two animals. In the group to which NS0-hIL-5R CDR antibody was administered, complete inhibition activity was not found and its effect was not sufficient.<br>
The above results show that the in vivo activity of antibodies greatly varies depending on the animal cells to be used in their production.   In addition, since a positive<br><br>
correlation was found between the degree of the in vivo activity of the anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody and the degree of its ADCC activity described in the item 2 of Example 4, it was indicated that the degree of ADCC activity is remarkably important for its activity expression.<br>
Based on the above results, it is expected that an antibody having potent ADCC activity is useful also in the clinical field for various diseases in human.<br>
Example 5<br>
Analysis of sugar chain which enhances ADCC activity:<br>
1.	Preparation of 2-aminopyridine-labeled sugar chain (PA-treated sugar chain)<br>
The humanized antibody of the present invention was acid-hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid to remove sialic acid. After hydrochloric acid was completely removed, the sugar chain was cleaved from the protein by hydrazinolysis [Method ofEnzymology, 83, 263 (1982)]. Hydrazine was removed, and A^-acetylation was carried out by adding an aqueous ammonium acetate solution and acetic anhydride. After lyophilizing, fluorescence labeling v^th 2-aminopyridine was carried out [J. Biochem., 95, 197 (1984)]. The fluorescence-labeled sugar chain (PA-treated sugar chain) was separated from impurity using Surperdex Peptide HR 10/30 Column (manufactured by Pharmacia). The sugar chain fraction was dried using a centrifugal concentrator and used as a purified PA-treated sugar chain.<br>
2.	Reverse phase HPLC analysis of PA-treated sugar chain of purified anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-<br>
grafted antibody<br>
According to the method in the item 1 of Example 5, various anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibodies produced in Example 3 were subjected to PA-treated sugar chain treatment, and reverse phase HPLC analysis was carried out by CLC-ODS column (manufactured by Shimadzu). An excess amount of a-L-flicosidase (derived from bovine kidney, manufactured by SIGMA) was added to the PA-treated sugar chain for digestion (37°C, 15 hours), and then the products were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 8). It was confirmed that the asparagine-linked sugar chain is eluted for 30 minutes to 80 minute using PA-treated sugar chain standards manufactured by Takara Shuzo. The ratio of sugar chains whose reverse phase HPLC elution positions were shifted (sugar chains eluted for 48 minutes to 78 minutes) by the a-L-fucosidase digestion was calculated. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
About 47% of the anti-hlL-SR CDR-grafted antibody produced by the YB2/0 cell and about 73% of the anti-hIL-5R CDR-grafted antibody produced by the NSO cell were sugar chains in which 1-position of fiicose is bound to 6-position of A^-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end through a-bond in the A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain (hereinafter referred to as "sugar chain having a-l^e-fticose"). Thus, the ratio of sugar chains in which 1-position of fticose is not bound to 6-position of Af-acetylglucosamine in the reducing end through a-bond in the A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain (hereinafter referred to as "a-l,6-fiicose-free sugar chain") is higher in the antibody produced by the YB2/0 cell than in the antibody produced by the NSO cell.<br>
3, Analysis of monosaccharide composition of purified anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody<br>
Sugar chains of anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibodies produced by the YB2/0 cell, NSO cell and CHO/d cell were hydrolyzed into monosaccharides by acid hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid, and monosaccharide composition analysis was carried out using BioLC (manufactured by Dionex).<br>
Among A/-glycoside-linked sugar chains, there are 3 mannose units in one sugar chain in the complex type A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain. A relative ratio of each monosaccharide obtained by calculating the number of mannose as 3 is shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Since the relative ratios of fiicose were in an order of YB2/0 
 <br>
4. Sugar chain analysis of antibody produced by CHO/dhfr" cell<br>
PA-treated sugar chains were prepared from purified anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody produced by CHO/dhfr" cell, and reverse phase HPLC analysis was carried out using CLC-ODS column (manufactured by Shimadzu) (Fig. 9). In Fig. 9, an elution time from 35 to 45 minutes corresponded to sugar chains having no fucose and an elution time from 45 to 60 minutes corresponded to sugar chains having fucose. Similar to the case of the antibody produced by mouse myeloma NSO cell, the anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody produced by CHO/dhfr" cell had less fiicose-free sugar chain content than the antibody produced by rat myeloma YB2/0 cell.<br>
Example 6<br>
Separation of potent ADCC activity antibody:<br>
The anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody produced by rat myeloma YB2/0 cell was separated using a lectin column which binds to sugar chains having fucose. HPLC was carried out using LC-6A manufactured by Shimadzu at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and at room temperature as the colimm temperature. After equilibration with 50 mM Tris-sulfate buffer (pH 7.3), the purified anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody was injected and then eluted by a linear density gradient (60 minutes) of 0.2 M a-methylmannoside (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque). The anti-hIL-5Ra CDR-grafted antibody was separated into non-adsorbed fraction and adsorbed fraction. When the non-adsorbed fraction and a part of the adsorbed fraction were sampled and their binding activity to hlL-5Ra was measured, they showed similar binding activity (Fig. lOA). When the ADCC activity was measured, the non-adsorbed fraction showed potent ADCC activity (100 to 1000 folds) than that of the part of adsorbed fraction (Fig. lOB). In addition, PA-treated sugar chains were prepared from the non-adsorbed fraction and a part of the adsorbed fraction, and reverse HPLC analysis was carried out using CLC-ODS column (manufactured by Shimadzu) (Fig. 11). In the non-adsorbed fraction, an antibody binding to fucose-free sugar chains was mainly present, and in the part of adsorbed fraction, an antibody binding to sugar chains having fucose was mainly present.<br><br>

free sugar chain:<br>
1.	Preparation of anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies having different ratio of a-156-fucose-free<br>
sugar chain<br>
In accordance with the method described in the item 2(1) of Example 1, transformed clones derived from YB2/0 cell capable of producing an anti-GD3 chimeric antibody was obtained. Antibodies were prepared from the transformed clones derived from YB2/0 cell and named lot 1, lot 2 and lot 3. Each sugar chain which is bound to the anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies of lot 1, lot 2 and lot 3 was analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 11(6), and it was found that the ratios of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains were 50%, 45% and 29%, respectively. Herein, these samples are referred to as anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (50%), anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (45%) and anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (29%).<br>
Also, sugar chains of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibody derived from the CHO/DG44 cell prepared in the item 2(2) of Example 1 were analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 11(6), and it was found that the ratio of a-l,6-fiicose-free sugar chains was 7%.    Herein, the sample is referred to as anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (7%).<br>
The anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (45%) and anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (7%) were mixed at a ratio of anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (45%) : anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (7%) = 5:3 or 1:7. Sugar chains of the samples were analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 10(6), and it was found that samples having the ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains of 24% and 13% (calculated value) were prepared. Herein, they are referred to as anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (24%) and anti-GD3 chimeric antibody (13%).<br>
Results of the sugar chain analysis of each of the samples are shown in Fig. 12. The ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains was shown as an average value of the result of two sugar chain analyses.<br>
2.	Evaluation of binding activity to GD3 (ELISA)<br>
The binding activities of the six kinds of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies having a different ratio of a-l,6-fiicose-free sugar chains prepared in the item 1 of Example 7 against GD3 (manufactured by Snow Brand Milk Products) were measured by the ELISA shown in the item 3 of Example 1. As a result, all of the six kinds of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies showed almost the same GD3-binding activity as shown in Fig. 13, and it was found that the ratio of the a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains does not have influence on the antigen binding activity of the antibody.<br><br>
3. Evaluation of ADCC activity on human melanoma cell line<br>
The ADCC activity of anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies on a human melanoma cell line G-361 (ATCC CRL 1424) was measured as follows.<br>
(1)	Preparation of target cell suspension<br>
1 X 10^ cells of a human melanoma cell line G-361 were prepared, a 3.7 MBq equivalent of a radioactive substance Na2^^Cr04 was added thereto and the mixture was allowed to react at 37°C for 1 hour to label the cells with the radioisotope. After the reaction, the cells were washed three times by a procedure of their suspension in a medium and subsequent centrifugation, re-suspended in the medium and then incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes in ice to effect spontaneous dissociation of the radioactive substance. After centrifiigation, the cells were adjusted to 2 x 10^ cells/ml by adding 5 ml of the medium and used as a target cell suspension.<br>
(2)	Preparation of human effector cell suspension<br>
A 50 ml portion of peripheral blood was collected from a healthy person and gently mixed with 0.5 ml of heparin sodium (manufactured by Shimizu Pharmaceutical). Using Lymphoprep (manufactured by AXIS SHIELD), this was centrifiiged (800 g, 20 minutes) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions to separate a mononuclear cell layer. The cells were washed by centrifiiging (1,200 rpm, 5 minutes) three times using a medixim and then re-suspended in the medium to give a density of 2 x 10^ cells/ml and used as a human effector cell suspension.<br>
(3)	Measurement of ADCC activity<br>
The target cell suspension prepared in the (1) was dispensed in 50 |al (1 x 10"* cells/well) into each well of a 96 well U-bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon). Next, 100 |al of the human effector cell suspension prepared in the (2) was added thereto (2 x 10^ cells/well, ratio of the human effector cells to the target cells was 20 : 1). Each of the anti"GD3 chimeric antibodies was added thereto to give a final concentration of 0.0005 to 5 |ig/ml, followed by reaction at 37°C for 4 hours. After the reaction, the plate was centriftiged and the amoimt of ^^Cr in the supernatant was measured using a y-counter. An amount of the spontaneously dissociated ^^Cr was calculated by carrying out the same procedure using the medium alone instead of the human effector cell suspension and antibody solution, and measuring the amount of ^'Cr in the supematant. An amount of the total dissociated ^^Cr was calculated by carrying out the same procedure using the<br><br>
medium alone instead of the antibody solution and a 1 mol/1 hydrochloric acid solution instead of the human effector cell suspension, and measuring the amount of ^*Cr in the supernatant.   The cytotoxic activity (%) was calculated using equation (II).<br>
Figs. 14 and 15 show results of the measurement of ADCC activity of the six kinds of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies having a different ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains at various concentrations (0.0005 to 5 |4.g/ml) using effector cells of two healthy donors (A and B), respectively. As shown in Figs. 14 and 15, ADCC activity of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies showed a tendency to increase in proportion to the ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains at each antibody concentration. The ADCC activity decreases when the antibody concentration is low. At an antibody concentration of 0.05 [ig/ml, the antibody in which the ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains is 24%, 29%, 45% or 50% showed almost the same potent ADCC activity but the ADCC activity was low in the antibody (13%) or (7%) in which the ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains is less that 20%.    These results were the same when the effector cell donor was changed.<br>

free sugar chain:<br>
1. Production of cells stably producing anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody<br>
Cells which capable of stably producing an anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody were prepared as follows using a tandem type expression vector pKANTEX2160 for an anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody described in WO 01/64754.<br>
(1) Preparation of antibody-producing cell using rat myeloma YB2/0 cell<br>
After introducing 10 ^ig of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody expression vector pKANTEX2160 into 4x 10^ cells of rat myeloma YB2/0 cell (ATCC CRL 1662) by electroporation [Cytotechnology, 3, 133 (1990)], the cells were suspended in 40 ml of Hybridoma-SFM-FBS(5) [Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) comprising 5% FBS (manufactured by PAA Laboratories)] and dispensed in 200 [al/well into a 96 well culture plate (manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite), After culturing them at 37°C for 24 hours in a 5% CO2 incubator, G418 was added to give a concentration of 1 mg/ml, followed by culturing for 1 to 2 weeks. Culture supematant was recovered fi-om wells in which growth of transformants showing G418 resistance was observed by the formation of colonies, and antigen binding activity of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody in the supematant was measured by the ELISA described in the item 2 of Example 8.<br><br>
Regarding the transformants in wells in which production of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was observed in culture supernatants, in order to increase an amount of the antibody production using a DHFR gene amplification system, each of them was suspended in the Hybridoma-SFM-FBS(5) medium comprising 1 mg/ml G418 and 50 nM DHFR inhibitor MTX (manufactured by SIGMA) to give a density of 1 to 2 x 10^ cells/ml, and the suspension was dispensed in 1 ml portions into wells of a 24 well plate (manufactured by Greiner). After culturing them at 37°C for 1 to 2 weeks in a 5% CO2 incubator, transformants showing 50 nM MTX resistance were induced. Antigen binding activity of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody in culture supematants in wells in which growlh of transformants was observed was measured by the ELISA described in the item 2 of Example 8.<br>
Regarding the transformants in wells in which production of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was observed in culture supematants, the MTX concentration was increased by the same method, and a transformant capable of grovsdng in the Hybridoma-SFM-FBS(5) medium comprising 200 nM MTX and of producing the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody in a large amount was finally obtained. The obtained transformant was made into a single cell (cloning) by limiting dilution twice, and the obtained cloned cell line was named KM2760 #58-35-16. In this case, using the method for determining the transcription product of an a-l,6-fiicosyltransferase gene shovm in Example 9, a cell line producing a relatively small amount of the transcription product was selected and used as a suitable cell line.<br>
(2) Preparation of antibody-producing cell using CHO/DG44 cell<br>
After introducing 4 jxg of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody expression vector pKANTEX2160 into 1.6x10^ cells of CHO/DG44 cell by electroporation [Cytotechnology, 3, 133 (1990)], the cells were suspended in 10 ml of IMDM-dFBS(lO)-HT(1) [IMDM medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) comprising 10% dFBS (manufactured by Invitrogen) and 1 x concentration of HT supplement (manufactured by Invitrogen)] and dispensed in 100 ^il/well into a 96 well culture plate (manufactured by Iwaki Glass). After culturing them at 37*^0 for 24 hours in a 5% CO2 incubator, the medium was changed to IMDM-dFBS(lO) (IMDM medium comprising 10% of dialyzed FBS), followed by culturing for 1 to 2 weeks. Culture supematant was recovered fi*om wells in which the growlh was observed due to formation of a transformant showing HT-independent growth, and an expression level of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody in the supematant was measured by the ELISA described in the item 2 of Example 8.<br><br>
Regarding the transformants in wells in which production of the anti-CCR4 dmeric antibody was observed in culture supernatants, in order to increase an amount of e antibody production using a DHFR gene amplification system, each of them was ispended in the IMDM-dFBS(lO) medium comprising 50 nM MTX to give a density of 1 2x10^ cells/ml, and the suspension was dispensed in 0.5 ml into wells of a 24 well plate lanufactured by Iwaki Glass). After culturing them at 37°C for 1 to 2 weeks in a 5% O2 incubator, transformants showing 50 nM MTX resistance were induced. Regarding e transformants in wells in which the growth was observed, the MTX concentration was creased to 200 nM by the same method, and a transformant capable of growing in the 4DM-dFBS(10) medium comprising 200 nM MTX and of producing the anti"CCR4 dmeric antibody in a large amount was finally obtained. The obtained transformant was imed 5-03. In this case, using the method for determining the transcription product of L a-l,6-fiacosyltransferase gene shovm in Example 9, a cell line producing a relatively nail amount of the transcription product was selected and used as a suitable cell line.<br>
Antibody binding activity to CCR4 partial peptide (ELISA)<br>

gion peptide capable of reacting with the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody.    In order to use<br>
in the activity measurement by ELISA, a conjugate v^th BSA (bovine serum albumin)<br>
lanufactured by Nacalai Tesque) was prepared by the following method and used as the<br>
itigen.      That  is,   100   ml   of a  DMSO   solution  comprising  25   mg/ml   SMCC<br>
-(iV-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-l-carboxylic   acid   iV-hydroxysuccinimide   ester]<br>
lanufactured by Sigma) was added dropwise to 900 ml of a 10 mg BSA-containing PBS<br>
ilution under stirring using a vortex, followed by gently stirring for 30 minutes.    A 1 ml<br>
)rtion of the reaction solution was applied to a gel filtration column such as NAP-10<br>
&gt;lumn or the like equilibrated with 25 ml of PBS, and then eluted with 1.5 ml of PBS and<br>
e resulting eluate was used as a BSA-SMCC solution (BSA concentration was calculated<br>
ised on A280 measurement).   Next, 250 ml of PBS was added to 0.5 mg of Compound 1<br>
id then completely dissolved by adding 250 ml of DMF, and the BSA-SMCC solution<br>
was added thereto under vortex, followed by gently stirring for 3 hours.   The reaction<br>
solution was dialyzed against PBS at 4°C overnight, sodium azide was added thereto to<br>
give a final concentration of 0.05%, and the mixture was filtered through a 0.22 mm filter<br>
to be used as a BSA-compound 1 solution.<br>
The prepared conjugate was dispensed at 0.05 |Lig/ml and 50 |il/well into a 96 well EIA plate (manufactured by Greiner) and incubated for adhesion at 4°C overnight. After washing each well with PBS, 1% BSA-PBS was added thereto in 100 ^il/well and<br><br>
allowed to react at room temperature to block the remaining active groups. After washing each well with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (hereinafter refened to as "Tween-PBS"), a culture supernatant of a transformant was added at 50 |al/well and allowed to react at room temperature for 1 hour. After the reaction, each well was washed with Tween-PBS, and then a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG(y) antibody solution (manufactui'ed by American Qualex) diluted 6000 times with 1% BSA-PBS as the secondary antibody was added at 50 )al/well and allowed to react at room temperature for 1 hour. After the reaction and subsequent washing with Tween-PBS, the ABTS substrate solution was added at 50 fil/well for color development, and 20 minutes thereafter, the reaction was stopped by adding a 5% SDS solution at 50 |al/well. Thereafter, the absorbance at OD415 was measured. The anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody obtained in the item 1 of Example 8 showed the binding activity to CCR4.<br>
3. Purification of anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody<br>
(l)Culturing of antibody-producing cell derived from YB2/0 cell and purification of<br>
antibody<br>
The anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody-expressing transformant cell clone KM2760 # 58-35-16 obtained in the item 1(1) of Example 8 was suspended in Hybridoma-SFM (manufactured by Invitrogen) medium comprising 200 nM MTX and 5% of Daigo's GF21 (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries) to give a density of 2 x 10^ cells/ml and subjected to fed-batch shaking culturing using a spinner bottle (manufactured by Iwaki Glass) in a constant temperature chamber of 37^C. After culturing them for 8 to 10 days, the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was purified from the culture supernatant recovered using Prosep-A (manufactured by Millipore) column and gel filtration. The purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was named KM2760-1.<br>
(2) Culturing of antibody-producing cell derived from CHO-DG44 cell and purification of antibody<br>
The anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody-producing transformant cell line 5-03 obtained in the item 1(2) of Example 8 was cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator using IMDM-dFBS(lO) medium in a 182 cm flask (manufactured by Greiner). When the cell density reached confluent after several days, the culture supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed with 25 ml of PBS buffer and then mixed with 35 ml of EXCELL 301 medium (manufactured by JRII). After culturing them at 37°C for 7 days in a 5% CO2 incubator, the culture supematant was recovered. The anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was purified from the culture supematant using Prosep-A (manufactured by Millipore) column<br><br>

When the binding activity to CCR4 of KM2760-1 and KM3060 was measured by ELISA, they showed equivalent binding activity.<br>
4.	Analysis of purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies<br>
Each (4 |ig) of the two kinds of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies produced by and purified from in different animal cells, obtained in the item 1 of this Example was subjected to SDS-PAGE in accordance with a known method [Nature, 227. 680 (1970)], and the molecular weight and purification degree were analyzed. In each of the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies, a single band corresponding to the molecular weight of about 150 Kd was found under non-reducing conditions, and two bands of about 50 Kd and about 25 Kd were found under reducing conditions. The molecular weights almost coincided with the molecular weights deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequences of antibody H chain and L chain (H chain: about 49 Kd, L chain: about 23 Kd, whole molecule: about 144 Kd) and coincided with reports stating that an IgG type antibody has a molecular weight of about 150 Kd under non-reducing conditions and is degraded into H chain having a molecular weight of about 50 Kd and L chain having a molecular weight of about 25 Kd under reducing conditions caused by cutting an S-S bond in the molecule [Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual^ Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Chapter 14 (1988), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press Limited (1996)], thus confirming that the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was expressed and purified as an antibody molecule having a correct structure.<br>
5.	Preparation of anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody having different ratio of a-l,6-fiacose-free<br>
sugar chain<br>
Sugar chains which are bound to anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody KM2760-1 derived from YB2/0 cell prepared in the item 3(1) of Example 8 and the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody KM3060 derived from CHO/DG44 cell prepared in the item 3(2) of Example 8 were analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 10(6). The ratio of a-l,6-fticose-free sugar chains was 87% and 8% in KM2760 and KM3060, respectively. Herein, the samples are referred to as anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (87%) and anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (8%).<br>
The anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (87%) and anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (8%) were mixed at a ratio of anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (87%): anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (8%) =1:39,16 : 67, 22 : 57, 32 : 47 or 42 : 37.    Sugar chains of these samples<br><br>
were analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 10(6). The ratio of a-156-fucose-free sugar chains was 9%, 18%, 27%, 39% and 46%, respectively. Herein, these samples are referred to as anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (9%), anti"CCR4 chimeric antibody (18%), anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (27%), anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (39%) and anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (46%).<br>
Results of the sugar chain analysis of each of the samples are shown in Fig. 16. The ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains was shown as an average value of the result of two sugar chain analyses.<br>
6.	Evaluation of binding activity to CCR4 partial peptide (ELISA)<br>
Binding activity of the six kinds of the different anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies having a different a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chain prepared in the item 5 of Example 8 to CCR4 partial peptide was measured in accordance with the method described in the item 2 of Example 8.<br>
As a result, as shown in Fig. 17, the six kinds of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies showed almost the same CCR4-binding activity, it was found that the ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains does not have influence on the antigen-binding activity of the antibody.<br>
7.	Evaluation of ADCC activity on human CCR4-high expressing cell line<br>
The ADCC activity of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies against a human CCR4-high expressing cell CCR4/EL-4 cell (WO 01/64754) was measured as follows.<br>
(1)	Preparation of target cell suspension<br>
Cells (1.5 X 10^) of a human CCR4-expressing cell, CCR4/EL-4 cell, described in WO 01/64754 were prepared and a 5.55 MBq equivalent of a radioactive substance Na2^^Cr04 was added thereto, followed by reaction at 37°C for 1.5 hours to thereby label the cells with a radioisotope. After the reaction, the cells were washed three times by suspension in a medium and subsequent centrifugation, resuspended in the medium and then incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes in ice for spontaneous dissociation of the radioactive substance. After centrifugation, the cells were adjusted to give a density of 2 x 10^ cells/ml by adding 7.5 ml of the medium and used as a target cell suspension.<br>
(2)	Preparation of human effector cell suspension<br>
From a healthy person, 60 ml of peripheral blood was collected, 0.6 ml of heparin sodium (manufactured by Shimizu Pharmaceutical) was added thereto, followed<br><br>
by gently mixing. The mixture was centrifliged (800 g, 20 minutes) to isolate a mononuclear cell layer using Lymphoprep (manufactured by AXIS SHIELD) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions. The cells were washed by centrifbging (1,400 rpm, 5 minutes) three times using a medium and then re-suspended in the medium to give a density of 5 x 10^ cells/ml and used as a human effector cell suspension.<br>
(3) Measurement of ADCC activity<br>
The target cell suspension prepared in the (1) was dispensed at 50 |il (1 x lO"^ cells/well) into each well of a 96 well U-bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon). Next, 100 |al of the human effector cell suspension prepared in the (2) was added thereto (5x10^ cells/well, ratio of the human effector cells to the target cells was 50 : 1). Furthermore, each of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies was added thereto to give a final concentration of 0.0001 to 10 p-g/ml, followed by reaction at 37°C for 4 hours. After the reaction, the plate was centrifiiged and the amount of ^^Cr in the supernatant was measured using a y-counter. An amount of the spontaneously dissociated ^^Cr was calculated by carrying out the same procedure using the medium alone instead of the human effector cell suspension and antibody solution, and measuring the amount of ^'Cr in the supernatant. An amount of the total dissociated ^^Cr was calculated by carrying out the same procedure using a 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution instead of the antibody solution and human effector cell suspension, and measuring the amount of ^'Cr in the supernatant. The ADCC activity (%) was calculated based on equation (II).<br>
Figs. 18 and 19 show results of the measurement of ADCC activity of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies having a different ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains at various concentrations (0.001 to 10 }ag/ml) using effector cells of two healthy donors (A and B), respectively. As shovm in Figs. 18 and 19, the ADCC activity of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies showed a tendency to increase in proportion to the ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains at each antibody concentration. The ADCC activity decreases when the antibody concentration is low. At an antibody concentration of 0.01 |ig/ml, the antibody in which the a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains is 27%, 39% or 46% showed almost the same potent ADCC activity but the ADCC activity was low in the antibody in which the ratio of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains is less than 20%. The results were the same as the case when the effector cell donor was changed.<br><br>

Competitive PCR was caiTied out using the FUT8 internal control DNA prepared in the item (4) and the host cell-derived cDNA obtained in the item (1) as the templates^ the determined value of the FUT8 transcription product in the host cell line was calculated from the relative value of the amount of the amplified product derived from each template. On the other hand, since it is considered that the p-actin gene is transcribed continuously in each cell and its transcription level is approximately the same between cells, transcription level of the P-actin gene was determined as a measure of the efficiency of synthesis reaction of cDNA in each host cell line. That is, the PCR was carried out using the p-actin internal control DNA prepared in the item (5) and the host cell-derived cDNA obtained in the item (1) as the templates, the determined value of the p-actin transcription product in the host cell line was calculated from the relative value of the amount of the amplified product derived from each template. Details thereof are described below.<br>
The FUT8 transcription product was determined by the following procedure. First, a set of sequence-specific primers (shown in SEQ ID N0s:13 and 14) common to the inner sequences of the ORF partial sequences of Chinese hamster FUT8 and rat FUT8 obtained in the item (2) were designed.<br>
Next, PCR was carried out using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) in 20 |al in total volume of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs, 0.5 ^imol/l gene-specific primers (SEQ ID N0s:13 and 14) and 5% DMSO] containing 5 \i\ of 50 folds-diluted cDNA solution prepared from each of respective host cell line in the item (1) and 5 ^il (10 fg) of the plasmid for intemal control. The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes and subsequent 32 cycles of heating at 94'C for 1 minute, 60°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute as one cycle.<br>
Also, PCR was carried out in a series of reaction in which 5 ^il (0.1 fg, 1 fg, 5 fg, 10 fg, 50 fg, 100 fg, 500 fg or 1 pg) of the FUT8 standard plasmid obtained in the item (4) was added instead of the each host cell line-derived cDNA, and used in the preparation of a calibration curve for the FUT8 transcription level.<br><br>
The P-actin transcription product was determined by the following procedure. First, two sets of respective gene-specific primers common to the imier sequences of the ORF full lengths of Chinese hamster P-actin and rat p-actin obtained in the item (3) were designed (the former are shown in SEQ ID N0s:15 and 16, and the latter are shown in SEQIDNOs:17andl8).<br>
Next, PCR was carried out using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) in 20 \i\ in total volume of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs, 0.5 |amol/l gene-specific primers (SEQ ID N0s:15 and 16, or SEQ ID N0s:17 and 18) and 5% DMSO] containing 5 |al of 50 folds-diluted cDNA solution prepared from respective host cell line in the item (1) and 5 |al (1 pg) of the plasmid for internal control. The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes aind subsequent 17 cycles of heating at 94°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 2 minutes as one cycle.<br>
Also, PCR was carried out in a series of reaction in which 5 |il (10 pg, 5 pg, 1 pg, 500 fg or 100 fg) of the p-actin standard plasmid obtained in the item (5) was added instead of the each host cell line-derived cDNA, and used in the preparation of a calibration curve for the P-actin transcription level.<br><br>
By carrying out PCR using the primer set described in Table 3, a DNA fragment having a size shown in the target column of Table 3 can be amplified from each gene transcription product and each standard, and a DNA fragment having a size shown in the competitor column of Table 3 can be amplified from each intemal control.<br>
A 7 |j,l portion of each of the solutions after PCR was subjected to 1.75% agarose gel electrophoresis, and then the gel was stained by soaking it for 30 minutes in 1 X concentration SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (manufactured by Molecular<br><br>
Probes). The amount of the amplified DNA fragment was measured by calculating luminescence intensity of each amplified DNA using a fluoro-imager (Fluorlmager SI; manufactured by Molecular Dynamics).<br>
The amount of an amplified product formed by PCR using a standard plasmid as the template was measured by the method, and a calibration curve was prepared by plotting the measured values against the amounts of the standard plasmid. Using the calibration curve, the amount of cDNA of a gene of interest in each cell line was calculated from the amount of the amplified product when each expression cell line-derived cDNA was used as the template, and the amount was defined as the mRNA transcription level in each cell line.<br>
The amount of the FUT8 transcription product in each host cell line when a rat FUT8 sequence was used in the standard and internal control is shown in Fig. 24. Throughout the culturing period, the CHO cell line showed a transcription level 10 folds or higher than that of the YB2/0 cell line. The tendency was also found when a Chinese hamster FUT8 sequence was used in the standard and internal control.<br>
Also, the FUT8 transcription levels are shovm in Table 4 as relative values to the amount of the p-actin transcription product. Throughout the culturing period, the FUT8 transcription level in the YB2/0 cell line was around 0.1% of (J-actin while it was 0.5% to 2% in the CHO cell line.<br>
The results shows that the amount of the FUT8 transcription product in YB2/0 cell line was significantly smaller than that in the CHO cell line.<br><br>

Cells of the DCHIOl-20 were suspended in EXCELL 302 medium (manufactured by JRH BIOSCIENCES) supplemented with 3 mmol/1 L-GLN (manufactured by Life Technologies), 0.3% PLURONIC F-68 (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 0.5% fatty acid concentrate (manufactured by Life Technologies), and 15 ml of the suspension was inoculated into T75 flask for suspension cell culture use (manufactured by Greiner) at a density of 2 x 10^ cells/ml. Also, cells of the 61-33 were suspended in Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin fraction V (manufactured by Life Technologies) (hereinafter referred to as "BSA"), and 15 ml of the suspension was inoculated into T75 flask for suspension cell culture (manufactured by Greiner) at a density of 2 X 10^ cells/ml. They were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days after culturing, 1x10 of respective host cells were recovered to extract total RNA using RNAeasy (manufactured by QIAGEN) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions.<br>
The total RNA was dissolved in 45 |al of sterile water, and 1 ^1 of RQl RNase-Free DNase (manufactured by Promega), 5 (il of the attached 10 x DNase buffer and 0.5 |j.l of RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (manufactured by Promega) were added thereto, followed by reaction at 37°C for 30 minutes to degrade genome DNA contaminated in the sample.

The reaction solution was diluted 50 folds with water and stored at -80°C until use.<br>
(2) Determination of transcription levels of each gene by competitive PCR<br>
The transcription level of each of the genes on the cDNA derived from the antibody-producing cell line obtained in the item (1) was determined by competitive PCR in accordance with Example 9(6).<br><br>
The FUT8 gene-derived mRNA transcription level in each of the antibody-producing cell lines was deteiTnined by the following procedure.<br>
CHFT8-pCR2.1 and YBFT8-pCR2.1, as plasmids in which cDNA partial fragments prepared in Example 9(2) from Chinese hamster PUTS and rat PUTS, respectively, were inserted into PCR2.I5 were digested with a restriction enzyme EcoRl, and the obtained linear DNAs were used as the standards in the preparation of a calibration curve for determining the PUTS transcription level.<br>
CHPT8d-pCR2.1 and YBPT8d-pCR2.1, which were obtained by deleting 203 bp between Seal and Hindlll of an inner nucleotide sequence of Chinese hamster FUT8 and rat FUT8, respectively, in Example 9(4) were digested with a restriction enzyme EeoKL, and the obtained linear DNAs were used as the internal standards for PUTS amount determination.<br>
PCR was carried out using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) in 20 \xl in total volume of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs, 0.5 )amol/l PUT8 gene-specific primers (SEQ ID N0s:13 and 14) and 5% DMSO] containing 5 |il of 50 folds-diluted cDNA solution prepared from each of the antibody-producing cell line in the item (1) and 5 ^.1 (10 fg) of the plasmid for internal control. The PCR was cai'ried out by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes and subsequent 32 cycles of heating at 94°C for 1 minute, 60°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute as one cycle.<br>
Also, PCR was carried out in a series of reaction in which 5 |al (0.1 fg, 1 fg, 5 fgj 10 fg, 50 fg, 100 fg, 500 fg or 1 pg) of the PUT8 standard plasmid was added instead of the each antibody-producing cell line-derived cDNA, and used in the preparation of a calibration curve for the PUT8 transcription level. In this case, 1 ^g/ml of a baker's yeast t-RNA (manufactured by SIGMA) was used for the dilution of the standard plasmid.<br>
On the other hand, since it is considered that the p-actin gene is transcribed constantly in each cell and its transcription level is approximately the same between cells, the transcription level of the P-actin gene was determined as an index of the efficiency of synthesis reaction of cDNA in each antibody-producing cell line.<br>
CHAc-pBS and YBAc-pBS as plasmids in which the ORP full length of each cDNA of Chinese hamster p-actin and rat p-actin prepared in Example 9(3) were inserted into pBluescript II KS(+), respectively, were digested with restriction enzymes Hindlll and Kpnl, and the obtained linear DNA samples were used as the standards in the preparation of a calibration curve for determining the p-actin transcription level.<br>
CHAcd-pBS and YBAcd-pBS which were obtained by deleting 180 bp between Dral and Dral of an inner nucleotide sequence of Chinese hamster p-actin and rat<br><br>
p-actin, respectively in Example 9(5)^ were digested with restriction enzymes Hindlll and Kpnl, and the obtained linear DNAs were used as the internal standards for p-actin determination.<br>
PCR was earned out using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) in 20 |il in total volume of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs, 0.5 |a.mol/l p-actin-specific primers (SEQ ID N0s:17 and 18) and 5% DMSO] containing 5 ^1 of 50 folds-diluted cDNA solution prepared from each of the antibody-producing cell lines and 5 [xl (1 pg) of the plasmid for internal control. The PCR was can-ied out by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes and subsequent 17 cycles of heating at 94°C for 30 seconds, eS^'C for 1 minute and 72°C for 2 minutes as one cycle. Also, PCR was carried out in a series of reaction in which 10 pg, 5 pg, 1 pg, 500 fg or 100 fg of the p-actin standard plasmid was added instead of the each antibody-producing cell line-derived cDNA, and used in the preparation of a calibration curve for the p-actin transcription level. In this case, 1 |ig/ml of a baker's yeast t-RNA (manufactured by SIGMA) was used for the dilution of standard plasmid.<br>
By PCR using the primer set described in Table 3, a DNA fragment having a size shown in the target colvmin of Table 3 can be amplified from each gene transcription product and each standard, and a DNA fragment having a size shovra in the competitor column of Table 3 can be amplified from each internal control.<br>
A 7 |xl portion of each of the solutions after PCR was subjected to 1.75% agarose gel electrophoresis, and then the gel was stained by soaking it for 30 minutes in 1 X concentration SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (manufactured by Molecular Probes). The amount of the amplified DNA fragment was measured by calculating luminescence intensity of each amplified DNA using a fluoro-imager (Fluorlmager SI; manufactured by Molecular Dynamics).<br>
The amount of the amplified product formed by PCR which used a standard plasmid as the template was measured by the method, and a calibration curve was prepared by plotting the measured values against the amounts of the standard plasmid. Using the calibration curve, the amount of cDNA of a gene of interest in each cell line was calculated from the amount of the amplified product when each antibody-producing cell line-derived cDNA was used as the template, and the value was defined as the mRNA transcription level in each cell line.<br>
The FUT8 transcription levels are shown in Table 5 as relative values to the amount of the p-actin transcription product. Throughout the culturing period, the FUT8 transcription level in the YB2/0 cell-derived antibody-producing 61-33 was 0.3% or less of p-actin while it was 0.7% to 1.5% in the CHO cell-derived antibody-producing cell.<br><br>
The results shows that the amount of the FUT8 transcription product in the YB2/0 cell-derived antibody-producing cell line was significantly less than that in the antibody-producing cell line derived from the CHO cell.<br><br>

After the reaction, the total RNA was purified again using RNAeasy (manufactured by QIAGEN) and dissolved in 50 \x\ of sterile water. In a 20 ^il reaction mixture using oligo(dT) as a primer, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 3 jig of the obtained total RNA by reverse transcription reaction using SUPERSCRIPT™ Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (manufactured by Life Technologies) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions.<br>

After the PCR, the reaction solution was subjected to 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, and a specific amplified fragment of 1728 bp was purified. Into a plasmid pCR2.1, 4 ^xl of the DNA fragment was employed to insert in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions attached to TOPO TA Cloning Kit (manufactured by Invitrogen), and E. coli DH5a was transformed with the reaction solution. Plasmid DNAs were isolated in accordance with a known method from cDNA-inserted 6 clones among the obtained kanamycin-resistant colonies.<br>
The nucleotide sequence of each cDNA inserted into the plasmid was determined using DNA Sequencer 377 (manufactured by Parkin Elmer) and BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction kit (manufactured by Parkin Elmer) in accordance with the method of the manufacture's instructions. It was confirmed that all of the inserted cDNAs of which sequences were determined encode the ORF fiill sequence of mouse FUT8. Among these, a plasmid DNA containing absolutely no reading error of bases by the PCR in the sequences were selected (its DNA sequence and amino acid sequence are shown in SEQ ID N0s:2 and 24, respectively). Also, inconsistency of 3 bases due to amino acid substitution was found in the sequence when compared with the mouse FUT8 sequence registered on GenBank. Herein, the plasmid is referred to mfFUT8-pCR2.1.<br>

Using the reaction solution, E. coli DH5a was transformed, and plasmid DNAs were isolated in accordance with a known method from the obtained ampicillin-resistant clones. Herein, the plasmid is referred to pBSmfFUTS.<br>
Using the pBSmfFUTS and pAGE249, a mouse FUT8 expression vector pAGEmfFUTS was constructed by the following procedure (Fig. 27). The pAGE249 is a derivative of pAGE248 [J. Biol Chem,, 269, 14730 (1994)], as a vector in which an SphV Sphl fragment (2.7 Kb) containing a dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) expression unit was removed from the pAGE248.<br>
In 50 \i\ of Universal Buffer H (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 1 )j,g of the pAGE249 was dissolved, and 20 units of a restriction enzyme Sail (manufactured by New England Biolabs) were added thereto, followed by digestion reaction at 37°C for 2 hours.

After the digestion reaction, to the reaction solution, 35 ^il of 1 mol/1 Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 3.5 |il of £. coli C15-derived alkaline phosphatase (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) were added thereto, followed by reaction at 65°C for 30 minutes to dephosphorylate the DNA termini. The reaction solution was extracted with phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, and the recovered DNA fragment was dissolved in 10 |al of sterile water.<br>
Separately, 1 jig of pBSmfFUTS was dissolved in 50 |al of Universal Buffer H (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), and 20 units of a restriction enzyme Sail (manufactured by New England Biolabs) were added thereto, followed by digestion reaction at 37'C for 2 hours.

Using the reaction solution, E. coli DH5a was transformed, and a plasmid DNA was isolated in accordance with a known method from the obtained ampicillin-resistant clones.   Herein, the plasmid is referi'ed to pAGEmfFUTS.<br>
(2) Preparation of mouse a-l,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene over-expressing cell line<br>
A stable FUT8 gene-expressing cell line was obtained by introducing the mouse FUT8 expression vector pAGEmfFUTS constructed in the item (1) into 61-33. the 61-33 is a clone obtained by carrying out serum-free adaptation of a transformant cell 7-9-51 (FERM BP-6691, International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) derived from a YB2/0 cell highly producing an anti-ganglioside GD3 chimeric antibody, and then carrying out single cell isolation by two limiting dilution.<br>
The plasmid pAGEmfFUTS was transferred into 61-33 by the following procedure in accordance with the electroporation [Cytotechnology, 3., 133 (1990)]. First, 30 jxg of the plasmid pAGEmfFUTS was dissolved in 600 j^l of NEBuffer 4 (manufactured by New England Biolabs), and 100 units of a restriction enzyme Fspl (manufactured by New England Biolabs) were added thereto, followed by digestion reaction at 37°C for 2 hours to obtain a linear fragment. The reaction solution was subjected to ethanol precipitation, and the recovered linear plasmid was made into a 1 |ig/^il aqueous solution. Next, the 61-33 was suspended in a K-PBS buffer (137 mol/1 KCl, 2.7 mol/1 NaCl, 8.1 mol/1 Na2HP04, 1.5 mol/1 KH2PO4, 4.0 mol/1 MgCb) to give a density of 2 x 10^ cells/ml, and 200 |al of the cell suspension (4 x 10^ cells) was mixed with 10 |al (10 |ig) of the linear plasmid. The cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (inter-electrode distance, 2 mm) (manufactured by BIO-RAD) and then electroporation was carried out using a cell fusion apparatus Gene Pulser (manufactured by BIO-RAD) at 0.2 KV pulse voltage and 250 |aF electric capacity. The cell suspension was mixed with 10 ml of Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 0.2% BSA (manufactured by Life Technologies) and dispensed in 100 \xl portions into a 96 well plate for suspension cell use (manufactured by Greiner). After culturing them at 37°C for 24 hours in 5% CO2, 50 |al of the culture supernatant was removed, and Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml Hygromycin B (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 5% fetal bovine dialyzed serum<br><br>
(manufactured by Life Technologies) and 0.2% BSA (manufactured by Life Teclmologies) was dispensed at 100 [xl. They were cultured for 3 weeks while repeating the medium exchange step at intervals of 3 to 4 days, and 14 cell lines showing hygromycin resistance were obtained.<br>
On the other hand, a negative control cell line was prepared by introducing the plasmid pAGE249 as a parent vector of the pAGEmfFUTS into the 61-33. According to the above procedure, 10 )ag of the plasmid pAGE249 converted into linear form with a restriction enzyme Fspl was introduced into 4x10^ cells of the 61-33 using the electroporation. The cells were mixed with 15 ml of Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 0.2% BSA (manufactured by Life Technologies), transferred into a T75 flask for suspension cell (manufactured by Greiner) and then cultured at 37°C for 24 hours in 5% CO2. After culturing them, a half of the culture supernatant (7.5 ml) was removed by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 4 minutes, and the cells were suspended in 7.5 ml of Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml Hygromycin B (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 5% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Teclmologies) and 0.2% BSA (manufactured by Life Technologies) and transferred into the T75 flask for suspension cell (manufactured by Greiner).

(3) Analysis of expression level of a-l,6-flicosyltransferase (FUT8) gene in cell lines over-expressing the gene<br>
Using 6 cell lines optionally selected from the 14 mouse FUTS-over expressing cell lines prepared from 61-33 in the item (2) and the negative control cell line, the FUT8 expression levels were compared using competitive RT-PCR.<br>
Each of these over-expression cell lines was suspended in Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml Hygromycin B (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 5% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 0.2% BSA (manufactured by Life Technologies) to give a density of 3 x 10^ cells/ml and then transferred into a T75 flask for suspension cell culture use (manufactured by Greiner). After culturing them at 37*^C for 24 hours in 5% CO2, 1 X 10 of intact cells were recovered to extract total RNA using RNAeasy (manufactured by QIAGEN) in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. The total RNA was dissolved in 45 ^1 of sterile water, and 0.5 U/|il of RQl RNase-Free DNase<br><br>
(manufactured by Promega), 5 |il of the attached 10 x DNase buffer and 0.5 ^1 of RNasin Ribonuclease Inliibitor (manufactured by Promega) were added thereto, followed by reaction at 3TC for 30 minutes to degrade genome DNA contaminated in the sample. After the reaction^ the total RNA was purified again using RNAeasy (manufactured by QIAGEN) and dissolved in 50 \i\ of sterile water.<br>
In a 20 ^il reaction mixture using oligo(dT) as a primer, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 |ig of the obtained total RNA by reverse transcription reaction using SUPERSCRIPT'^^ Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (manufactured by Life Technologies) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions. The reaction solution was diluted 50 folds with water and the transcription level of each gene was determined by the competitive PCR in accordance with Example 9(6).<br>
The FUT8 gene-derived mRNA transcription level in each expression ceil line was determined by the following procedure.<br>
YBFT8-pCR2.1, as a plasmid in which a cDNA partial fragment prepared in Example 9(2) from rat FUT8 was inserted into pCR2.1, was digested with a restriction enzyme £'c<?RI , and the obtained linear DNA was used as the standard in the preparation of a calibration curve for   determining the FUT8 transcription level.<br/>
Among the YBFT8-pCR2.1 prepared in Example 9(4), YBFT8d-pCR2.1 obtained by deleting 203 bp between Seal and Hindlll of an inner nucleotide sequence of rat FUT8 was digested with a restriction enzyme EcdRL^ and the obtained linear DNA was used as the internal control for FUT8 determination.<br>
PCR was carried out using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) in 20 \x\ in total volume of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs, 0.5 ^imol/l FUT8 gene-specific primers (SEQ ID N0s:13 and 14) and 5% DMSO] containing 5 ^il of 50 folds-diluted cDNA solution prepared from respective expression cell line in the above and 5 ^1 (10 fg) of the plasmid for internal control. The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes and subsequent 32 cycles of heating at 94°C for 1 minute, 60°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute as one cycle.<br>
Also, PCR was carried out in a series of reaction in which 5 |al (0.1 fg, 1 fg, 5 fg, 10 fg, 50 fg, 100 fg, 500 fg or 1 pg) of the FUT8 standard plasmid was added instead of the each expression cell line-derived cDNA, and used in the preparation of a calibration curve for the FUT8 transcription level. In this case, 1 )ag/ml baker's yeast t-RNA (manufactured by SIGMA) was used for the dilution of standard plasmid.<br>
On the other hand, since it is considered that the p-actin gene is transcribed constantly in each cell and its transcription level is approximately the same between cells.<br><br>
the transcription level of the p-actin gene was determined as an index of the efficiency of synthesis reaction of cDNA in each expression cell line.<br>
YBAc-pBS, as a plasmid in which the ORF full sequence of cDNA of rat P-actin was inserted into pBluescript II KS(+) prepared in Example 9(3), was digested with restriction enzymes Hindlll and Kpnl, and the obtained linear DNA was used as the standard in the preparation of a calibration curve for determining the P-actin gene transcription level.<br>
YBAcd-pBS obtained from the YBAc-pBS by deleting 180 bp between Oral and Dral of an inner nucleotide sequence of rat p-actin was digested with restriction enzymes Hindlll and Kpnly and the obtained linear DNA was used as the internal standards for p-actin amount determination.<br>
PCR was carried out using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) in 20 |j,l in total volume of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs, 0.5 |amol/l p-actin-specific primers (SEQ ID N0s:17 and 18) and 5% DMSO] containing 5 ^il of 50 folds-diluted cDNA solution prepared from each of the expression cell lines and 5 jxl (1 pg) of the plasmid for internal control. The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes and subsequent 17 cycles of heating at 94°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 2 minutes as one cycle.<br>
Also, PCR was carried out in a series of reaction in which 10 pg, 5 pg, 1 pg, 500 fg or 100 fg of the P-actin standard plasmid was added instead of the each expression cell line-derived cDNA, and used in the preparation of a calibration curve for the p-actin transcription level. In this case, 1 |j.g/ml baker's yeast t-RNA (manufactured by SIGMA) was used for diluting the standard plasmid.<br>
By carrying out PCR using the primer set described in Table 3, a DNA fragment having a size shown in the target column of Table 3 can be amplified from each gene transcription product and each standard, and a DNA fragment having a size shown in the competitor column of Table 3 can be amplified from each internal control.<br>
Each (7 |al) of the solutions after PCR was subjected to a 1.75% agarose gel electrophoresis, and then the gel was stained by soaking it for 30 minutes in 1 X concentration SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (manufactured by Molecular Probes). By calculating luminescence intensity of each amplified DNA fragment using a fluoro-imager (Fluorlmager SI; manufactured by Molecular Dynamics), the amount of the amplified DNA fi^agment was measured.<br>
The amount of an amplified product formed by PCR using the standard plasmid as the template was measured by the method, and a calibration curve was prepared<br><br>
by plotting the measured values against the amounts of the standard plasmid. Using the calibration curve, the amount of cDNA of a gene of interest in each cell line was calculated from the amount of an amplified product when each expression cell line-derived cDNA was used as the template, and the amount was defined as the mRNA transcription level in each cell line.<br>
Fig. 28 shows the FUT8 transcription levels as relative values to the amount of P-actin transcription product. Three cell lines mfPUTS-l, mfFUT8-2 and mfFUT8-4 and the pAGE249-introduced cell line were cell lines having a relatively small PUTS transcription level, which was equivalent to 0.3 to 10% of a P-actin transcription level. On the other hand, other three cell lines mfFUT8-3, mfFUT8-6 and mfFUT8-7 were cell lines having a relatively large FUT8 transcription level, which was equivalent to 20 to 40% of a p-actin transcription level.<br>
(4) Purification of antibody produced by a-l,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene over-expressing cell line<br>
Each of the six FUT8 gene over-expressing cell lines and one negative control cell line obtained in the item (2) was suspended in Hybridoma-SFM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 200 nmol/1 MTX, 0.5 mg/ml Hygromycin B (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and 0.2% BSA (manufactured by Life Technologies) to give a density of 2 x 10^ cells/ml, and then 100 ml in total of the suspension was inoculated into three T225 flasks for suspension cell culture use (manufactured by IWAKI). After culturing them at 2&gt;TC for 7 to 9 days in a 5% CO2 incubator, the number of intact cells was counted to confirm that their viability was almost the same (each 30% or less), and then each cell suspension was recovered. Each of the cell suspensions was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes, and the recovered supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 1 hour and then filtered using PES Filter Unit (manufactured by NALGENE) having a pore diameter of 0.22 jim with 150 ml capacity.<br>
Prosep-A HighCapacity (manufactured by bioPROCESSING) was packed in a 0.8 cm diameter coluirm to a thickness of 2 cm and washed with 10 ml of 0,1 mol/1 citrate buffer (pH 3.0) and 10 ml of 1 mol/1 glycine/NaOH-0.15 mol/1 NaCl buffer (pH 8.6) in that order to effect equilibration the carrier. Next, 100 ml of each of the culture supernatant was passed through the column and washed with 50 ml of 1 mol/1 glycine/NaOH-0.15 mol/1 NaCl buffer (pH 8.6). After washing them, the antibody absorbed to Prosep-A was eluted using 2.5 ml of a 0.1 mol/1 citrate buffer (pH 3.0), the eluate was fractionated at 500 fil and each fraction was neutralized by mixing with 100 ^1 of 2 mol/1 Tris-HCl (pH 8.5).<br><br>
Two fractions containing the antibody at a high concentration (1.2 mi in total) were selected by tlie BCA method [Anal Bioche?n., 150. 76 (1985)], combined and then dialyzed against 10 mol/1 citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 4°C for a whole day and night. After the dialysis, the antibody solution was recovered and subjected to sterile filtration using a 0.22 ^m pore size Millex GV (manufactured by MILLIPORE).<br>
(5)7^2 vitro cytotoxic activity (ADCC activity) of antibody produced by mouse a-l,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene over-expressing cell line<br>
In order to evaluate in vitro cytotoxic activity of the anti-GD3 antibodies purified in the item (4), ADCC activity was measured using a GD3"positive cell, human melanoma cultured cell line G-361 (RCB0991, Cell Bank at The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research).<br>
The G-361 cells subcultured in RPMI1640 medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) (hereinafter referred to as "RPMI1640"FBS(10)") were suspended in 500 |il of RPMI1640-FBS(IO) at a density of 1 x 10^ cells, and 3.7 MBq of Na2^*Cr04 was added thereto, followed by culturing at 37°C for 30 minutes for labeling the cells with a radioisotope. After centrifiigation at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the target cells were suspended in 5 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10). The washing step was repeated three times and then the cell suspension was incubated for 30 minutes on ice for spontaneous dissociation of the radioactive substance. The washing step was again repeated twice and then the cells were suspended in 5 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10) to thereby prepare 2x10^ cells/ml of a target cell suspension.<br>
On the other hand, 30 ml of peripheral blood was collected from a healthy person and gently mixed with 0.5 ml of heparin sodium (manufactured by Shimizu Pharmaceutical) and then mixed with 30 ml of physiological saline (manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical). After the mixing, 10 ml of the mixture was gently overlaid on 4 ml of Lymphoprep (manufactured by NYCOMED PHARMA AS) and centrifiiged at room temperature at 2,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The separated mononuclear cell fractions were collected from the centrifiigation tubes, combined and then suspended in 30 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10). After centrifiigation at room temperature at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the cells were suspended in 20 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10). The washing step was repeated twice and then 2x10^ cells/ml of an effector cell suspension was prepared using RPMI1640-FBS(10).<br>
The target cell suspension was dispensed at 50 ^1 (1 x lO'* cells/well) into each well of a 96 well U-bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon).    Subsequently, the effector<br><br>
cell suspension was dispensed at 100 |il (2 x 10^ cells/well) into each well to thereby adjust the ratio of the effector cells to the target cells to 20 : 1. Next, using a 10 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0), a series of dilution solution of 0.01 |ig/ml, 0.1 |ag/ml, 1 |xg/ml and 10 |ig/ml of each anti-GD3 antibody obtained in the item (4) was prepared, and the diluted solutions were dispensed at 50 \x\ into the wells to give final concentrations of 0.0025 |ag/ml, 0.025 |ag/ml, 0.25 |ag/ml and 2.5 |ig/ml, respectively. After carrying out the reaction at 37°C for 4 hours in 5% CO2, the plate was centriftiged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes. Into a 12 mm diameter RIA tube (manufactured by IWAKI), 50 jal of the supernatant in each well was transferred and, and the amount of the dissociated ^^Cr was measured using MINAX-y auto-gamma counter 5550 (manufactured by PACKARD).<br>
Also, the amount of the spontaneously dissociated ^^Cr was calculated by carrying out the same reaction in a reaction mixture in which 150 |il of RPMI1640-FBS(IO) was added instead of the effector cell suspension and antibody solution. The amount of the total dissociated ^^Cr was calculated by carrying out the same reaction in a reaction mixture in which 100 |al of 1 N hydrochloric acid and 50 |j.l of RPMI1640-FBS(IO) were added instead of the effector cell suspension and antibody solution. Using these values, the ADCC activity was calculated based on the formula (II) described in the item 2(3) of Example 2.<br>
Fig. 29 shows ADCC activity of each of the anti-GD3 antibodies for G-361 cell. Three cell lines mfFUT8-l, mfFUT8-2 and mfFUT8-4 having a low FUT8 expression level as shown in Fig. 28 showed potent ADCC activity equivalent to that of the negative control pAGE249-introduced cell line. On the other hand, other three cell lines mfFUTS-3, mfFUT8-6 and mfFUT8-7 having a high FUT8 expression level as shown in Fig. 28 showed low ADCC activity equivalent to that of the anti-GD3 antibody produced from CHO cell. Based on these results, it was shown that the ADCC activity of produced antibodies can be controlled by regulating the expression level of FUT8 in host cells.<br>
(6) Sugar chain analysis of antibody produced by mouse a"l,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) gene over-expressing cell line<br>
Sugar chains of the anti-GD3 antibodies purified in the item (4) were analyzed. The sugar chains binding to the antibodies produced by mfFUT8-6 and pAGE249-introduced cell lines were cleaved from proteins by subjecting the antibodies to hydrazinolysis [Method of Enzymology, 83, 263 (1982)]. After removing hydrazine by evaporation under a reduced pressure, A^-acetylation was carried out by adding an aqueous ammonium acetate solution and acetic anhydride. After freeze-drying, fluorescence labeling by 2-aminopyridine [J.  Biochem,, 95,  197 (1984)] was carrying out.     A<br><br>
fluorescence-labeled sugar chain group (PA-treated sugar chain group) was separated from excess reagents using Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (manufactured by Pharmacia). The sugar chain fractions were dried using a centrifugation concentrator and used as a purified PA-treated sugar chain group. Next, the purified PA-treated sugar chain group was subjected to reverse phase HPLC analysis using a CLC-ODS column (manufactured by Shimadzu) (Fig. 30). When calculated from the peak area, the content of a-156-fucose-free sugar chains in mfFUT8-6 was 10%, and the content of a-l,6-fucose-bound sugar chains was 90%. The content of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains in pAGE249 was 20%, and the content of a-l,6-fucose-bound sugar chains was 80%. Based on these results, it was found that the content of a-l,6-fucose-bound sugar chains of a produced antibody is increased by over-expressing the FUT8 gene.<br>
Fig. 30 shows elution patterns obtained by carrying out reverse phase HPLC analysis of each of PA-treated sugar chains prepared from antibodies produced by mfFUT8-6 and pAGE249-introduced cell lines. Figs. 30A and 30B show elution patterns of mfFUT8-6 and pAGE249, respectively. The relative fluorescence intensity and the elution time are plotted as the ordinate and the abscissa, respectively. Using a sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.8) as buffer A and a sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.8) + 0.5% 1-butanol as buffer B, the analysis was canied out by the following gradient.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
GlcNAc, Gal, Man, Fuc and PA indicate //-acetylglucosamine, galactose, mannose, fucose and a pyridylainino group, respectively. In Figs. 30 and 31, the ratio of the a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chain group was calculated from the area occupied by the peaks (i) to (iv) among (i) to (ix), and the ratio of the a-l,6-fucose-bound sugar chain group from the ai-ea occupied by the peaks (v) to (ix) among (i) to (ix).<br>

A gene of the plasmid pKOFUT8Puro was introduced into the strain 5-03 as described below in accordance with the electroporation method [Cytotechnology, 2, 133 (1990)].    First,  150 ^ig of the plasmid pKOFUT8Puro was dissolved in 1.8 ml of<br><br>
NEBuffer for Sail (manufactured by New England Biolabs), and 600 units of a restriction enzyme Sail (manufactured by New England Biolabs) were added thereto, followed by digestion reaction at 37°C for 5 hours to obtain a linear fragment. The reaction solution was extracted with phenol/chloroform extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation, and the recovered linear plasmid was made into a 1 |j,g/|al aqueous solution. Separately, the strain 5-03 was suspended in a K-PBS buffer (137 mmol/1 KCl, 2.7 mmol/l NaCl, 8.1 mmol/1 Na2HP04, 1.5 mmol/1 KH2PO4, 4.0 mmol/1 MgCli) to give a density of 8 x 10*^ cells/ml. After mixing 200 \i\ of the cell suspension (1.6 x 10^ cells) with 4 |il (4 |ag) of the linear plasmid, an entire volume of the cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (inter-electrode distance, 2 mm) (manufactured by BIO-RAD) and then the electroporation was carried out using a cell fusion apparatus Gene Pulser (manufactured by BIO-RAD) at 350 V pulse voltage and 250 |aF electric capacity. After caiTying out the electroporation using 30 cuvettes in the same manner, the cell suspension was suspended in IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 1 x concentration HT supplement (manufactured by Life Technologies) and inoculated into 30 adhesion cell culture dishes of 10 cm in diameter (manufactured by Falcon). After culturing them at 37°C for 24 hours in 5% CO2, the culture supematant was removed, and IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 15 |ag/ml puromycin (manufactured by SIGMA) and 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) was dispensed in 10 ml portions. After culturing them for 10 days while repeating the medium exchange at intervals of 3 to 4 days, puromycin-resistant cell lines were obtained.<br>
(2) Preparation of targeting vector-introduced cell lines<br>
Arbitrary 900 colonies were obtained as follows from the puromycin-resistant cell lines obtained in the item (1).<br>
First, culture supematant was removed from the 10 cm dish in which colony of puromycin-resistant cell lines were formed and 7 ml of a phosphate buffer was added to the dish which was subsequently set under a stereoscopic microscope. Next, each colony was scratched and sucked up using Pipetteman (manufactured by GILSON) and transferred into a 96 well round-bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon). After a trypsin-treatment, each clone was inoculated into a 96 well flat-bottom plate for adhesion cell culture use (manufactured by Iwaki Glass) and cultured for 1 week using IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 15 fig/ml puromycin (manufactured by SIGMA) and 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies).<br><br>
After culturing thenij each clone in the plate was subjected to trypsin treatment and then mixed with two volumes of a freeze drying medium (20% DMSO, 40% fetal bovine serum, 40% IMDM). A half of the mixture was inoculated into a 96 well flat-bottom plate for adhesion cell culture (manufactured by Iwaki Glass) as a replica plate, while the remaining half of the mixture was subjected to cryopreservation as master plates. The replica plate was cultured for 1 week using IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 15 |ig/ml of puromycin (manufactured by SIGMA) and 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies).<br>
(3)	Diagnosis of homologous recombination by genomic PCR<br>
Diagnosis of homologous recombination in the 900 clones obtained in the item (2) was carried out by genomic PCR.<br>
First, genome DNA of each clone was prepared from the replica plate prepared in the item (2) in accordance with a known method [Analytical Biochemistry^ 20L 331 (1992)] and dissolved overnight in 30 ^1 of a TE-RNase buffer (pH 8.0) (10 mmol/1 Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/1 EDTA, 200 |ag/ml RNase A). Also, a primer (shown in SEQ ID NO:26) which binds to a sequence outside the targeting vector homologous region among the FUT8 genome region obtained in Example 12 and a primer (shown in SEQ ID NO:27) which binds to the loxP sequence in the vector were designed.<br>

The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 3 minutes and subsequent 38 cycles of heating using the reaction at 94°C for 1 minute, 60°C for 1 minute and 72°C for 2 minutes as one cycle.<br>
After the PCR, the reaction solution was subjected to 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, and a specifically amplifying fragment of about 1.7 Kb containing a border region between the CHO cell genome region and the targeting vector homologous region was identified as a positive clone.   One positive clone was found by the method.<br>
(4)	Diagnosis of homologous recombination by genome Southern blotting<br>
Diagnosis of homologous recombination in the 1 clone, whose positive signal was confirmed in the item (3), was carried out by genome Southem blotting.<br>
Among the master plates cryo-preserved in the item (2), a 96 well plate containing the positive clone found in the item (3) was selected and incubated at 37°C for<br><br>
10 minutes in 5% CO2. After the incubation, cells were collected from a well corresponding to the positive clone and inoculated into a 24 well flat bottom plate for adhesion cell (manufactured by Greiner). After culturing them for 1 week using IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 15 |ag/ml of puromycin (manufactured by SIGMA) and 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies), the cells were inoculated into a 6 well flat bottom plate for adhesion cell (manufactured by Greiner). Genome DNA was prepared from the clone in the plate in accordance with a known method [Nucleic Acids Research, 3, 2303 (1976)] and dissolved overnight in 150 |xl of a TE-RNase buffer (pH 8.0) (10 mmol/1 Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/1 EDTA, 200 |ig/ml RNase A).<br>
In 120 |al of NEBuffer 3 (manufactured by New England Biolabs), 12 )ig of the obtained genome DNA was dissolved, and 25 unites of a restriction enzyme Pstl (manufactured by New England Biolabs) were added thereto, followed by digestion reaction at 37°C overnight. A DNA fragment was recovered from the reaction solution by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in 20 \i\ of TE buffer (pH 8.0) (10 mmol/1 Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/1 EDTA) and then subjected to 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. After the electrophoresis, the genome DNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane in accordance with a known method [Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 76, 3683 (1979)]. After completion of the transfer, the nylon membrane was heated at 80°C for 2 hours.<br>
Separately, a probe used in the Southern blotting was prepared as follows. First, primers (SEQ ID NOs:28 and 29) which bind to a sequence outside the targeting vector homologous region with the FUT8 genome region obtained in Example 12 were designed. Next, using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 20 |il of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs and 0.5 |imol/l gene-specific primers (SEQ ID NOs:28 and 29)] containing 4.0 ng of the plasmid pFUT8fgE2-2 obtained in Example 12(2) was prepared, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out. The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 1 minute and subsequent 25 cycles of heating at 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds and 74*'C for 1 minute as one cycle. After the PCR, the reaction solution was subjected to 1.75% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis to purify a probe DNA fragment of about 230 bp. The obtained probe DNA solution (5 |al) was labeled with a radioisotope using 1.75 MBq of [a-^^P]dCTP and Megaprime DNA Labeling System, dCTP (manufactured by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).<br>
The hybridization was carried out as follows. First, the nylon membrane was sealed in a roller bottle, and pre-hybridization was carried out at 65°C for 3 hours by adding 15 ml of a hybridization solution [5 x SSPE, 50 x Denhaldt's solution, 0.5% (w/v)<br><br>
SDS, 100 |ig/ml salmon sperm DNA]. Next, the ^^P-labeled probe DNA was heat-denatured and put into the bottle. Then, the nylon membrane was heated at 65°C overnight.<br>
After the hybridization, the nylon membrane was soaked in 50 ml of 2 x SSC-0.1% (w/v) SDS and heated at 65^C for 15 minutes. After repeating the washing step twice, the membrane was soaked in 50 ml of 0.2 x SSC-0.1% (w/v) SDS and heated at 65 °C for 15 minutes. After the washing, the nylon membrane was exposed to an X-ray film at -80°C for two nights for development.<br>
By the restriction enzyme Pstl treatment, a DNA fragment of about 4.4 Kb is formed from a wild type FUT8 allele. On the other hand, a DNA fragment of about 6.0 Kb is formed from an allele in which homologous recombination with a targeting vector was generated.<br>
By the method, such specific fragments of about 4.4 Kb and about 6.0 Kb were found from the positive clone genome DNA in the item (3). Since the quantitative ratio of both fragments was 1 : 1, it was confirmed that the clone is a clone in which 1 copy of the FUT8 allele was disrupted. Hereinafter, the clone is referred to as the strain lst.AFUT8 2-46.<br>
3. Deletion   of  drug   resistance   gene   from   CHO   cell   in   which   1   copy   of the a-l,6-fiicosyltransferase (FUT8) gene was disrupted (1) Introduction of Cre recombinase expression vector<br>
A Cre recombinase expression vector pBS 185 (manufactured by Life Technologies) was introduced into the strain Ist.AFUTS 2-46 prepared in the item 2 of this Example.<br>
A gene of the plasmid pBS185 was introduced into the strain Ist.AFUTS 2-46 as follows in accordance with the electroporation method [Cytotechnology, 3, 133 (1990)]. First, the strain lst.AFUT8 2-46 was suspended in a K-PBS buffer (137 mmol/1 KCl, 2.7 mmol/1 NaCl, 8.1 mmol/1 Na2HP04, 1.5 mmol/1 KH2PO4, 4.0 mmol/1 MgCb) to give a density of 8 x 10^ cells/ml. After mixing 200 \x\ of the cell suspension (1.6 x 10^ cells) with 4 |ag of the plasmid pBS185, an entire volume of the cell-DNA mixture was transferred into Gene Pulser Cuvette (inter-electrode distance, 2 mm) (manufactured by BIO-RAD) and then the gene transfer was carried out using a cell ftision apparatus Gene Pulser (manufactured by BIO-RAD) at 350 V pulse voltage and 250 |iF electric capacity. After the gene transfer, the cell suspension was suspended in 10 ml of IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) and 1 x concentration HT supplement (manufactured<br><br>
by Life Technologies) and further diluted 20,000 folds using the same medium. The cells were inoculated into 7 adhesion cell culture dishes of 10 cm in diameter (manufactured by Falcon) and then cultured at 37°C for 24 hours in 5% CO2. After culturing them, the culture supernatant was removed and IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) was dispensed at 10 ml. Culturing was earned out for 10 days while repeating the medium exchange at intervals of 3 to 4 days.<br>
(2)	Preparation of Cre recombinase expression vector-introduced cell lines<br>
Arbitrary 400 colonies were obtained as follows from the cell line obtained in the item (1).<br>
First, culture supernatant was removed from the 10 cm dish and 7 ml of a phosphate buffer was added to the dish which was subsequently set under a stereoscopic microscope. Next, each colony was scratched and sucked up using Pipetteman (manufactured by GILSON) and transferred into a 96 well round-bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon). After a trypsin-treatment, each clone was inoculated into a 96 well flat-bottom plate for adhesion cell culture (manufactured by Iwaki Glass) and cultured for 1 week using IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies).<br>
After the culturing, each clone in the plate was subjected to trypsin treatment and then mixed with two volumes of a freeze drying medium (20% DMSO, 40% fetal bovine serum, 40% IMDM). A half of the mixture was inoculated into a 96 well flat-bottom plate for adhesion cell culture use (manufactured by Iwaki Glass) to prepare a replica plate, while the remaining half was subjected to cryopreservation as a master plate.<br>
Next, the replica plate was cultured for 6 days using IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 15 |ig/ml of puromycin (manufactured by SIGMA) and 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies). A positive clone from which the puromycin resistance gene interposed between loxP sequences was eliminated by the expression of Cre recombinase dies out in the presence of puromycin.   By the selection method, 91 positive clones were found.<br>
(3)	Diagnosis of drug resistance gene elimination by genome Southern blotting<br>
Diagnosis of drug resistance gene elimination by the genome Southern blotting was carried out on optional 6 clones among the positive clones found in the item (2).<br>
Among the master plates cryo-preserved in the item (2), 96 well plates containing the 6 positive clones were selected and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes in 5%<br><br>
CO2. After the incubation, cells were collected from a well corresponding to each positive clone and inoculated into a 24 well flat bottom plate for adhesion cell use (manufactured by Greiner). After culturing them for 1 week using IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies), the cells were inoculated into a 6 well flat bottom plate for adhesion cell use (manufactured by Greiner). Genome DNAs were prepared from each clone in the plate in accordance with a known method [Nucleic Acids Research, 3, 2303 (1976)] and dissolved overnight in 150 |al of a TE-RNase buffer (pH 8.0) (10 mmol/1 Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/1 EDTA, 200 )ig/ml RNase A).<br>
In 120 |il of NEBuffer for BamUl (manufactured by New England Biolabs), 12 ptg of the obtained genome DNA was dissolved, and 20 unites of a restriction enzyme BamUl (manufactured by New England Biolabs) were mixed, followed by digestion reaction at 37°C overnight. A DNA fragment was recovered from the reaction solution by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in 20 ^il of TE buffer (pH 8.0) (10 mmol/1 Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/l EDTA) and then subjected to 0.4% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. After the electrophoresis, the genome DNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane in accordance with a known method [Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA, 76, 3683 (1979)]. After completion of the transfer, the nylon membrane was heated at 80°C for 2 hours.<br>
On the other hand, a probe used in the Southern blotting was prepared as follows. First, primers (SEQ ID NOs:30 and 31) which bind to a sequence outside the targeting vector homologous region among the FUT8 genome region obtained in Example 12 were designed. Next, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using a DNA polymerase ExTaq (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), by preparing 20 \xl of a reaction solution [ExTaq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mmol/1 dNTPs and 0.5 |imol/l gene-specific primers (SEQ ID NOs:30 and 31)] containing 4.0 ng of the plasmid pFUT8fgE2-2 obtained in Example 12(2). The PCR was carried out by heating at 94°C for 1 minute and subsequent 25 cycles of heating at 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds and 74°C for 1 minute as one cycle. After the PCR, the reaction solution was subjected to 1.75% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis to purify a probe DNA fragment of about 230 bp. A 5 jal portion of the obtained probe DNA solution was radioisotope-labeled using 1.75 MBq of [a-^^P]dCTP and Megaprime DNA Labeling System, dCTP (manufactured by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).<br>
The hybridization was carried out as follows. First, the nylon membrane was sealed in a roller bottle, and pre-hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 3 hours by adding 15 ml of a hybridization solution [5 x SSPE, 50 x Denhaldt's solution, 0.5% (w/v)<br><br>
SDS, 100 ^ig/ml salmon sperm DNA]. Next, the ^^P-labeled probe DNA was heat-denatured and put into the bottle and the nylon membrane was heated overnight at 65 °C.<br>
After the hybridization, the nylon membrane was soaked in 50 ml of 2 x SSC-0.1% (w/v) SDS and heated at 65°C for 15 minutes. After repeating the washing step twice, the membrane was soaked in 50 ml of 0.2 x SSC-0.1% (w/v) SDS and heated at 65°C for 15 minutes. After washing the nylon membrane, it was exposed to an X-ray film two nights at -80°C for development.<br>
By the restriction enzyme BamHl treatment, a DNA fragment of about 19.0 Kb was formed from a wild type FUT8 allele. Also, a DNA fragment of about 12.5 Kb was formed from an allele in which homologous recombination with a targeting vector was generated. In addition, when the puromycin resistance gene (about 1.5 Kb) was deleted from the allele in which homologous recombination was generated, a DNA fragment of about 11.0 Kb was formed by the same treatment.<br>
By the method, such specific fragments of about 19.0 Kb and about 11.0 Kb were found from the genome DNA of 5 clones among the 6 clones. Since the quantitative ratio of both fragments was 1 : 1, it was shown that the puromycin resistance gene was deleted from the cell lines in which 1 copy of the FUT8 genome region was disrupted. Hereinafter, one of the clone is called Ist.AFUTS 2-46-1. Also, results of the genome Southern blotting of the strain Ist.AFUTS 2-46-1, Ist.AFUTS 2-46 and 5-03 are shown in Fig. 41. Also, the strain Ist.AFUTS 2-46-1, as a name of 2-46-1, has been deposited on September 26, 2001, as FERM BP-7755 in International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken 305-8566 Japan)).<br>
4. Purification of antibody produced by a-l,6-fucosyltransferase (FUTS) gene-disrupted cell line<br>
Ist.AFUTS 2-46-1 obtained in the item 3 of this Example by disrupting one copy of the FUTS allele was suspended in IMDM medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) supplemented with 15 |ig/ml of puromycin (manufactured by SIGMA) and 10% fetal bovine dialyzed serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) to give a density of 3 X 10^ cells/ml, and then 60 ml in total of the suspension was inoculated into two T182 flasks for adhesion cell culture use (manufactured by Greiner). After culturing them for 3 days, the supernatant was discarded and changed to a total of 60 ml of EXCELL301 medium (manufactured by JRH Biosciences).<br>
After culturing them at 37°C for 7 days in a 5% CO2 incubator, the number of intact cells was counted to confirm that their viability was almost the same (each 30% or<br><br>
less), and then each cell suspension was recovered. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes, and the recovered supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 1 hour and then filtered using 150 ml capacity PES Filter Unit (manufactured by NALGENE) having a pore diameter of 0.22 |im.<br>
Prosep-A HighCapacity (manufactured by bioPROCESSING) was packed in a 0.8 cm diameter column to a thickness of 2 cm and washed with 10 ml of 0.1 mol/1 citrate buffer (pH 3.0) and 10 ml of 1 mol/1 glycine/NaOH-0.15 mol/1 NaCl buffer (pH 8.6) in this order to effect equilibrate the carrier. Next, 100 ml of each of the culture supernatant was passed tlirough the column and washed with 50 ml of 1 mol/1 glycine/NaOH-0.15 mol/1 NaCl buffer (pH 8.6). After washing it, the antibody absorbed to Prosep-A was eluted using 2.5 ml of 0.1 mol/1 citrate buffer (pH 3.0), the eluate was fractionated in 500 |il portions and each fraction was neutralized by mixing with 100 |j.l of 2 mol/1 Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Two fractions containing the antibody at a high concentration (1.2 ml in total) were selected by the BCA method [AnaL Biochem., 150, 76 (1985)], combined and then dialyzed against 10 mol/1 citrate-0.15 mol/1 NaCl buffer (pH 6.0) at 4°C for a whole day and night. After the dialysis, the antibody solution was recovered and subjected to sterile filtration using a 0.22 jam pore size Millex GV (manufactured by MILLIPORE).<br>
5./w vitro cytotoxic activity (ADCC activity) of antibody produced by a-l,6-fticosyltransferase (FUT8) gene-disrupted cell line<br>
In order to evaluate in vitro cytotoxic activity of the anti-CCR4 antibody purified in the item 4 of this Example, ADCC activity was measured using the CCR4-positive cell line CCR4/EL-4 described in Example 8.<br>
The CCR4/EL-4 cells subcultured in RPMI1640 medium (manufactured by Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Life Technologies) (hereinafter referred to as "RPMI1640-FBS(10)") were suspended in 500 |al of RPMI1640-FBS(10) at a density of 1 x 10^ cells, and 3.7 MBq of Na2^'Cr04 was added thereto, followed by culturing at 37°C for 90 minutes to label the cells with a radioisotope. After centrifiigation at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the target cells were suspended in 5 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10). The washing step was repeated three times and then the cell suspension was incubated for 30 minutes on ice for spontaneous dissociation of the radioactive substance. The washing step was again repeated twice and then the cells were suspended in 5 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10) to thereby prepare 2.0 x 10^ cells/ml of a tai'get cell suspension.<br>
Separately, 30 ml of venous blood was collected from a healthy person, gently mixed with 0.5 ml of heparin sodium (manufactured by Shimizu Pharmaceutical) and then<br><br>
mixed with 30 ml of physiological saline (manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical). After mixing them, 10 ml of the mixture was gently overlaid on 4 ml of Lymphoprep (manufactured by NYCOMED PHARMA AS) and centrifixged at room temperature at 2,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The sepai'ated mononuclear cell fractions were collected from the centrifligation tubes, combined and then suspended in 30 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10). After centrifiigation at room temperature at 1,200 rpm for 15 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and the cells were suspended in 20 ml of RPMI1640-FBS(10). The washing Step was repeated twice and then 2.5 x 10^ cells/ml of an effector cell suspension was prepared using RPMI1640-FBS( 10).<br>
The target cell suspension was dispensed at 50 |LI1 (1 X lO'* cells/well) into each well of a 96 well U-bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon). Subsequently, the effector cell suspension was dispensed at 100 jil (2.5 x 10^ cells/well) into each well to thereby adjust the ratio of the effector cells to the target cells to 25 : 1. Next, using RPMI1640-FBS(IO), a series of dilution solution of 0.01 |xg/ml, 0.1 pg/ml, 1 jag/ml and 10 ^g/ml was prepared from each of the anti-CCR4 antibodies obtained in the item 5 of Example 13, and the diluted solutions were dispensed in 50 |j,l portions into the wells to give final concentrations of 0.0025 jig/ml, 0.025 )ag/ml, 0.25 )Lig/ml and 2.5 )ag/ml, respectively. After the reaction at 37'^C for 4 hours in 5% CO2, the plate was centrifiiged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes. Into a 12 mm diameter RIA tube (manufactured by IWAKI), 75 |xl of the supernatant in each well was batched off and the amount of the dissociated ^^Cr was nteasured using MINAX-y auto-gamma counter 5550 (manufactured by PACKARD).<br>
Also, the amount of the spontaneously dissociated ^'Cr was calculated by carrying out the same reaction in a reaction mixture in which 150 |al of RPMI1640-FBS(IO) was added instead of the effector cell suspension and antibody solution. The amount of the total dissociated ^^Cr was calculated by carrying out the same reaction in a reaction mixture in which 100 |il of 1 N hydrochloric acid and 50 |jil of RPMI1640-FBS(IO) were added instead of the effector cell suspension and antibody solution. Using these values, the ADCC activity was calculated based on equation (II).<br>
Fig. 42 shows ADCC activity of each of the anti-CCR4 antibodies. The antibody obtained from the strain Ist.AFUTS 2-46-1 in which 1 copy of the FUT8 allele was disrupted showed a significantly more potent ADCC activity than the antibody produced by the strain 5-03 which is the CHO cell line before gene disruption. Also, changes in the antigen binding activity of these antibodies were not observed. Based on the results, it was confirmed that the ADCC activity of produced antibodies can be improved by disrupting the FUT8 allele in host cells.<br><br>

After washing the cells with 5 ml of Dulbecco PBS (manufactured by Invitrogen), 1.5 ml of OL05% trypsin (manufactured by Invitrogen) diluted with Dulbecco PBS was added thereto and incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes for peel the cells from the flask bottom. The peeled cells were recovered by a centrifugation operation generally used in cell culture and suspended in IMDM-FBS(IO) medium to give a density of 1 x 10^ cells/ml, and then 0.1 |j.g/ml of an alkylating agent A^-methyl-N'-nitro-A^-nitrosoguanidine (hereinafter referred to as "MNNG", manufactured by Sigma) was added or not added thereto. After incubating them at 37°C for 3 days in a CO2 incubator (manufactured by TABAI), the culture supernatant was discarded, and the cells were again washed, peeled and recovered by the same operations, suspended in IMDM-FBS(IO) medium and then inoculated into an adhesion culture 96 well plate (manufactured by IWAKI Glass) to give a density of 1,000 cells/well. To each well, as the final concentration in medium, 1 mg/ml Lens culinaris agglutinin (hereinafter referred to as "LCA", manufactured by Vector), 1 mg/ml Aleuria aurantia agglutinin (Aleuria aurantia lectin; hereinafter referred to as "AAL", manufactured by Vector) or 1 mg/ml kidney bean agglutinin (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin; hereinafter referred to as "L-PHA", manufactured by Vector) was added. After culturing them at 37°C for 2 weeks in a CO2 incubator, the appeared colonies were obtained as lectin-resistant CHO/DG44. Regarding the obtained lectin-resistant CHO/DG44, an LCA-resistant cell line was named CHO-LCA, an AAL-resistant cell line was named CHO-AAL and an L-PHA-resistant cell line was named CHO-PHA. When the resistance of these cell lines to various kinds of lectin was examined, it was found that the CHO-LCA was also resistant to AAL and the CHO-AAL was also resistant LCA. In addition, the CHO-LCA and CHO-AAL also showed a resistance to a lectin which recognizes a sugar chain structure identical to the sugar chain structure recognized by LCA and AAL, namely a lectin which recognizes a sugar chain structure in which 1-position of fticose is bound to 6-position of A^-acetylglucosamine residue in the reducing end through a-bond in the A^-glycoside-linked sugar chain. Specifically, it was found that the CHO-LCA and CHO-AAL can show resistance and survive even in a medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml at a final concentration of a pea agglutinin (Pisum sativum agglutinin;<br><br>
hereinafter referred to as "PSA", manufactured by Vector). In addition, even when the alkylating agent MNNG was not added, it was able to obtain lectin-resistant cell lines by increasing the number of cells to be treated. Hereinafter, these cell lines were used in analyses.<br>
(2)	Preparation of anti-CCR4 human chimeric antibody-producing cell<br>
An anti-CCR4 human chimeric antibody expression plasmid pKANTEX2160 was introduced into the three lectin-resistant cell lines obtained in the (1) by the method described in Example 8, and gene amplification by a drug MTX was carried out to prepare an anti-CCR4 human chimeric antibody-producing cell line. By measuring an amount of antibody expression by the ELISA described in Example 8-2, antibody-expressing transformants were obtained from each of the CHO-LCA, CHO-AAL and CHO-PHA. Regarding each of the obtained transformants, a transformant derived from CHO-LCA was named CH0/CCR4-LCA, a transformant derived from CHO-AAL was named CH0/CCR4-AAL and a transformant derived from CHO-PHA was named CH0/CCR4-PHA. Also, the CH0/CCR4-LCA, as a name of Nega-13, has been deposited on September 26, 2001, as PERM BP-7756 in International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST Tsukuba Central<br>

(3)	Production of potent ADCC activity antibody by lectin-resistant CHO cell<br>
Using the three transformants obtained in the (2), purified antibodies were obtained by the method described in Example 8-3. The antigen binding activity of each of the purified anti-CCR4 human chimeric antibodies was evaluated using the ELISA described in Example 8-2. The antibodies produced by all transformants showed an antigen binding activity similar to that of the antibody produced by a recombinant cell line (strain 5-03) prepared in Example 8 using general CHO/DG44 cell as the host. Using these purified antibodies, ADCC activity of each of the purified anti-CCR4 hxmian chimeric antibodies was evaluated in accordance with the method described in Example 8-<br>

strain 5-03, about 100 folds-increased ADCC activity was observed in the antibodies<br>
produced by the CH0/CCR4-LCA and CH0/CCR4-AAL. On the other hand, no<br>
significant increase in the ADCC activity was observed in the antibody produced by the<br>
CH0/CCR4-PHA. Also, when ADCC activities of the antibodies produced by the<br>
CH0/CCR4-LCA and YB2/0 were compared in accordance with the method described in<br>
Example 8-7, it was found that the antibody produced by the CH0/CCR4-LCA shows<br><br>
more potent ADCC activity than the antibody produced by the strain 5-03, similar to the case of the antibody KM2760-1 produced by the YB2/0 cell line prepared in Example 8-1 (Fig. 44).<br>
(4) Sugar chain analysis of antibodies produced by lectin-resistant CHO cell<br>
Sugar chains of the anti-CCR4 human chimeric antibodies purified in the (3) were analyzed. The solution of each of the purified antibodies was exchanged to 10 mM KH2PO4 using Ultra Free 0.5-1 OK (manufactured by Millipore). The exchange was carried out in such a manner that the exchanging ratio became 80 folds or more. The concentration of the antibodies after the solution exchange was measured using UV-1600 (manufactured by Shimadzu). The molar absorption coefficient was calculated from the amino acid sequence of each antibody based on the following equation (III) [Advances in Protein Chemistry, \2, 303 (1962)], and the concentration was determined by defining the absorbance at 280 nm as 1.38 mg/ml.<br>

Into Hydraclub S-204 test tube, 100 |ag of each antibody was put and dried using a centrifugal evaporator. The dried sample in the test tube was subjected to hydrazinolysis using Hydraclub manufactured by Hohnen. The sample was allowed to react with hydrazine at 110°C for 1 hour using a hydrazinolysis reagent manufactured by Hohnen hydrazinolysis [Method of Enzymology, 83, 263 (1982)]. After the reaction, hydrazine was evaporated under a reduced pressure, and the reaction tube was retumed to room temperature by allowing it to stand for 30 minutes.   Next, 250 |il of an acetylation<br><br>
reagent manufactured by Hohnen and 25 jal of acetic anhydride were added thereto, followed by thoroughly stirred for reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then, 250 |al of the acetylation reagent and 25 |il of acetic anhydride were further added thereto, followed by thoroughly stirring for reaction at room temperatxire for 1 hour. The sample was frozen at -SO^'C in a freezer and freeze-dried for about 17 hours. Sugar chains were recovered from the freeze-dried sample using Cellulose Cartridge Glycan Preparation Kit manufactured by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. The sample sugar chain solution was dried using a centrifiigal evaporator and then subj ected to fluorescence labeling with 2-aminopyridine [J. Biochem., 95, 197 (1984)]. The 2-aminopyridine solution was prepared by adding 760 |al of HCl per 1 g of 2-aminopyridine (1 x PA solution) and diluting the solution 10 folds with reverse osmosis purified water (10-folds diluted PA solution). The sodium cyanoborohydride solution was prepared by adding 20 |il of 1 X PA solution and 430 |uil of reverse osmosis purified water per 10 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride. To the sample, 67 |al of a 10 folds-diluted PA solution was added, followed by reaction at 100°C for 15 minutes and spontaneously cooled, and 2 ^il of sodium cyanoborohydride was fiirther added thereto, followed by reaction at 90°C for 12 hours for fluorescence labeling of the sample sugar chains. The fluorescence-labeled sugar chain group (PA-treated sugar chain group) was separated from excess reagent using Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (manufactured by Pharmacia). This step was carried out using 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and at a column temperature of room temperature, and using a fluorescence detector of 320 nm excitation wavelength and 400 nm fluorescence wavelength. The eluate was recovered 20 to 30 minutes after addition of the sample and dried using a centrifugal evaporator to be used as purified PA-treated sugar chains. Next, reverse phase HPLC analysis of the purified PA-treated sugar chains was carried out using CLC-ODS column (manufactured by Shimadzu, 
 <br>
analysis. A PA-treated sugar chain whose reducing end is not A^-acetylglucosamine was excluded from the peak area calculation, because it is an impurity or a by-product during preparation of PA-treated sugar chain.<br>
The analysis was carried out in the same manner as in Example 11(6) using a sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.8) as buffer A and a sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.8) + 0.5% 1-butanol as buffer B.<br>
In Fig. 45, the ratio of the a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chain group was calculated from the area occupied by the peaks (i) to (iv) among (i) to (viii), and the ratio of the a-1,6-fucose-bound sugar chain group from the area occupied by the peaks (v) to (viii) among (i) to (viii).<br>
Results of the sugar chain structure analysis of the purified anti-CCR4 human chimeric antibodies produced by lectin-resistant cell lines are shown in Table 6. The result shows the analysis of sugar chains of the anti-CCR4 human chimeric antibody produced by lectin-resistant cell lines. The ratio of a-l,6-fiicose-free sugar chains (%) calculated from peak areas by analyzing by the method described in Example d(4) is shown in the table.<br><br>
In comparison with the antibody produced by the strain 5-03, the ratio of the a-1,6-fiicose-free sugar chains was increased from 9% to 48% in the antibody produced by the CHO/CCR4-LCA when calculated from the analyzed peak area. The ratio of a-1,6-fiicose-free sugar chains was increased from 9% to 27% in the antibody produced by the CH0/CCR4-AAL. On the other hand, changes in the sugar chain pattem and ratio of the a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains were hardly found in the PHA-resistant cell line when compared v^th the strain 5-03.<br><br>

SIGMA) and 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin to give a density of 6 x lO'* cells/ml, and the suspension was dispensed in 50 p-l/well portions into a 96 well culture plate (manufactured by Iwaki Glass). Next, a medium prepared by suspending at concentrations of 0 mg/ml, 0.4 mg/ml, 1.6 mg/ml or 4 mg/ml LCA {Lens cuUnaris agglutinin: manufactured by Vector Laboratories) in IMDM-dFBS(lO) medium containing 200 nM MTX (manufactured by SIGMA) and 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin was added to the plate at 50 ^il/well, followed by culturing at 3TC for 96 hours in a 5% CO2 incubator. After culturing them, WST-I (manufactured by Boehringer) was added at 10 |il/well and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes in a 5% CO2 incubator to effect color development, and then the absorbance at 450 nm and 595 nm (hereinafter referred to as "OD450" and "OD595", respectively) was measured using Microplate Reader (manufactured by BIO-RAD), In the same manner, the pAGE249 vector-introduced transformant cells were measured by the same method. The test was carried out twice independently.<br>
Fig. 52 shows the number of survived cells in each well by percentage when a value calculated by subtracting OD595 from OD450 measured in the above is used as the survived number of each cell group and the number of survived cells in each of the LCA-free wells is defined as 100%. As shown in Fig. 52, decrease in the LCA-resistance was observed in the GMD-expressed CH0/CCR4-LCA, and the survival ratio was about 40% in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml LCA and the survival ratio was about 20% in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml LCA. On the other hand, in the pAGE249 vector-introduced CH0/CCR4-LCA, the survival ratio was 100% in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml LCA and the survival ratio was about 80% even in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml LCA. Based on these results, it was suggested that expression level of GMD gene in the CH0/CCR4-LCA was decreased and, as a result, the resistance against LCA was obtained.<br>

i) Preparation of target cell suspension<br>
A 3.7 MBq equivalent of a radioactive substance Na2^^Cr04 was added to 1x10^ cells of the CCR4-EL4 (cf Example 8-7) cultured using a medium prepared by adding 500 |ag/ml G418 sulfate (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque) to the RPMI1640-FBS(IO) medium, followed by reaction at 37°C for 90 minutes to thereby label the cells<br><br>
with a radioisotope. After the reaction, the cells were washed three times by suspension in the RPMI1640-FBS(10) medium and subsequent centrifogation, re-suspended in the medium and then incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes in ice for spontaneous dissociation of the radioactive substance. After centriftigation, the cells were adjusted to 2.5 x 10^ cells/ml by adding 5 ml of the RPMI1640-FBS(10) medium and used as a target cell suspension.<br>
ii) Preparation of effector cell suspension<br>
From a healthy person, 50 ml of venous blood was collected and gently mixed with 0.5 ml of heparin sodium (manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceutical). Using Lymphoprep (manufactured by Nycomed Pharma AS), the mixture was centrifiiged in accordance with the manufacture's instructions to separate a mononuclear cell layer. The cells were washed three times by centrifiiging using the RPMI1640-FBS(10) medium and then resuspended in the medium to give a density of 2 x 10*^ cells/ml and used as a effector cell suspension.<br>
iii) Measurement of ADCC activity<br>
The target cell suspension prepared in the 1) was dispensed at 50 |il (1 x 10"* cells/well) into each well of a 96 well U-bottom plate (manufactured by Falcon). Next, 100 |al of the effector cell suspension prepared in the 2) was added thereto (2 x 10^ cells/well, ratio of the effector cells to the target cells was 25 : 1). Each of various anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies (the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody purified in the item (3), and KM2760-1 and KM3060) was fiuther added thereto to give a final concentration of 0.0025 to 2,5 ^g/ml, followed by reaction at 37°C for 4 hours. After the reaction, the plate was centrifiiged and the amount of ^'Cr in the supernatant was measured using a y-counter. The amount of the spontaneously dissociated ^*Cr was calculated by carrying out the same procedure using the medium alone instead of the effector cell suspension and antibody solution, and measuring the amount of ^'Cr in the supernatant. The amount of the total dissociated ^'Cr was calculated by carrying out the same procedure using the medium alone instead of the antibody solution and adding 1 N hydrochloric acid instead of the effector cell suspension and measuring the amount of ^*Cr in the supernatant. The ADCC activity was calculated based on the formula (II).<br>
Results of the measurement of ADCC activity are shown in Fig. 53. As shown in Fig. 53, ADCC activity of the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody obtained fi-om the GMD-expressed CH0/CCR4-LCA was decreased to a similar degree to that of the KM3060 obtained in Example 8. On the other hand, ADCC activity of the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody obtained from the pAGE249 vector-introduced CH0/CCR4-<br><br>
LCA showed a similar degree of ADCC activity to that of the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody obtained from the CH0/CCR4-LCA. Based on the results, it was suggested that expression level of GMD gene in the CH0/CCR4-LCA is decreased and, as a result, an antibody having potent ADCC activity can be produced<br>
(6) Sugar chain analysis of anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody derived from GMD-expressed CH0/CCR4-LCA<br>
Sugar chains binding to the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody obtained in the item (3) were analyzed in accordance with the method shown in Example 14(4), with the analyzed results shown in Fig. 55. In comparison vsdth the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody prepared from CHO/CCR4-LCA in Example 14, the ratio of sugar chain having no a-l,6-fucose in the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody derived from GMD-expressed CH0/CCR4-LCA was decreased to 9% when calculated from the peak area. Thus, it was shovra that the ratio of sugar chain having no a-l,6-fiicose in the antibody produced by the cell is decreased to similar level of the antibody produced by the strain 5-03, by expressing GMD gene in the CH0/CCR4-LCA<br>

Using DNA Sequencer 377 (manufactured by Parkin Elmer), the nucleotide sequence of 27 bases in upstream of the termination codon of CHO cell-derived GMD cDNA contained in the plasmid was determined.<br>
The fiill length cDNA sequence of the CHO-derived GMD gene determined by the items (1), (2) and (3) and the corresponding amino acid sequence are shown in SEQ ID NOs:65 and 71, respectively.<br><br>
2. Determination of genomic sequence containing CHO/DG44-derived cell GMD gene<br>
A 25 mer primer having the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:66 was prepared from the mouse GMD cDNA sequence determined in Example 17-1. Next, a CHO cell-derived genome DNA was obtained by the following method. A CHO/DG44 cell-derived KC861 was suspended in IMDM-dFBS(10)-HT(l) medium [IMDM-dFBS(lO) medium comprising 1 x concentration of HT supplement (manufactured by Invitrogen)] to give a density of 3 x 10^ cells/ml, and the suspension was dispensed at 2 ml/well into a 6 well flat bottom plate for adhesion cell use (manufactured by Greiner). After culturing them at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator until the cells became confluent on the plate, genome DNA was prepared from the cells on the plate by a known method [Nucleic Acids Research, 3, 2303 (1976)] and dissolved overnight in 150 ^1 of TE-RNase buffer (pH 8.0) (10 mmol/1 Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/1 EDTA, 200 |ag/ml RNase A).<br>
A reaction solution (20 |al) [1 x Ex Taq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0*2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 unit of EX Taq polymerase (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) and 0.5 ^iM of synthetic DNA primers of SEQ ID NO:59 and SEQ ID NO:66] containing 100 ng of the obtained CHO/DG44 cell-derived genome DNA was prepared, and PCR was carried out using DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (manufactured by Perkin Elmer) by heating at 94°C for 5 minutes and subsequent 30 cycles of heating at 94°C for 1 minute and 68°C for 2 minutes as one cycle. After completion of the reaction, the PCR reaction solution was fi^actionated by agarose electrophoresis and then a DNA fragment of about 100 bp was recovered using Gene Clean II Kit (manufactured by BIO 101) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions. The recovered DNA fragment was ligated to a pT7Blue(R) vector (manufactured by Novagen) using DNA Ligation Kit (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), and E. coli DH5a (manufactured by Toyobo) was transformed using the obtained recombinant plasmid DNA, thereby obtaining a plasmid ex3. Using DNA Sequencer 377 (manufactured by Parkin Elmer), the nucleotide sequence of CHO cell-derived genome DNA contained in the plasmid was determined.    The result is shown in SEQ ID NO:67.<br>
Next, a 25 mer primer having the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:68 and a 25 mer primer having the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:69 were generated on the base of the CHO cell-derived GMD cDNA sequence determined in Example 17-1. Next, 20 ^l of a reaction solution [1 x Ex Taq buffer (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 unit of EX Taq polymerase (manufactured by Takara Shuzo) and 0.5 |aM of the synthetic DNA primers of SEQ ID NO:68 and SEQ ID NO:69] containing 100 ng of the CHO/DG44-derived genome DNA was prepared, and PCR was carried out using DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (manufactured by Perkin Elmer) by heating at<br><br>
94°C for 5 minutes and subsequent 30 cycles of heating at 94°C for 1 minute and 68°C for 2 minutes as one cycle.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the PCR reaction solution was fractionated by agarose electrophoresis and then a DNA fragment of about 200 bp was recovered using Gene Clean II Kit (manufactured by BIO 101) in accordance with the manufacture's instructions. The recovered DNA fragment was ligated to a pT7Blue(R) vector (manufactured by Novagen) using DNA Ligation Kit (manufactured by Takara Shuzo), and E, coli DH5a (manufactured by Toyobo) was transformed using the obtained recombinant plasmid DNA, thereby obtaining a plasmid ex4. Using DNA Sequencer 377 (manufactured by Parkin Elmer), the nucleotide sequence of CHO cell-derived genome DNA contained in the plasmid was determined.   The result is shown in SEQ ID NO:70.<br>
Example 18<br>
Sugar chain analysis of conventionally available antibodies:<br>
Sugar chains binding to a conventionally available anti-HER2/neu antibody Herceptin (manufactured by GENENTECH and Roche) produced by CHO cell as the host cell was analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 10(6) (Fig. 31). When calculated from each peak area of elution diagram, the content of a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chains of Herceptin was 16%, and the content of a-l,6-fiicose-bound sugar chains was 84%. The same analysis was carried out on other commercially available antibodies, Rituxan (manufactured by GENENTECH, Roche and IDEC) and Zenapax (manufactured by Roche and PDL), and the a-l,6-fucose-free sugar chain content of was less than that in Herceptin.<br>
Fig. 31 is a graph showing elution pattern of PA-treated sugar chains prepared from Herceptin, obtained by analyzing them by reverse phase HPLC. The relative fluorescence intensity and the elution time are plotted as the ordinate and the abscissa, respectively. The reverse phase HPLC analysis conditions, sugar chain structure analysis and calculation of the ratio of sugar chain group containing no a-l,6-fucose sugar chain were carried out by the same methods of Example 11(6).<br>
