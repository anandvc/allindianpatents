				<td>Apparatus  for  spinning  filaments<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  an  apparatus  for  spinning filaments,   having  a  heating  box,   a  plurality  of  spinnerets arranged  in  the  heating  box  and  at  least one  spinning  pump arranged  on  the  outside  of  the  heating  box,   there  being provided  a.  melt  line  leading  to  the  spinning  pump,   a  plurality of  distributing  lines  leading  from  the  spinning  pump  to  the spinnerets,   and  a  heating  jacket   surrounding  the  spinning pump.<br>
Known  from  the  prior  art  are  pieces  of  apparatus  for  spinning filaments  which  comprise  essentially  an  extruder  or  other  unit for  producing  melt,   such  as  directly  from  a  reaction  vessel for  example,   one  or  more  spinning  bars,   an  air-blast  duct,   a preparing  means  and  a  stretching  unit.   The  spinning  bar generally  comprises  a  heating  box,   a  spinning  pump  and  a plurality  of  spinnerets  arranged  in  a  row.   The  extruder  feeds the  melted  thermoplastic  material   to  the  spinning  pump  via   a melt  line.   The  spinning  pump  distributes  the  melted  material via  distributing  lines   to  the  spinnerets,   from  which  the material  emerges   in  the  form  of   filaments.   In  the  air-blast duct  which  follows,   the  filaments  are  cooled  and  are  prepared with  a  preparing   liquid,   which  makes   the   subsequent  processing<br>
easier. The filaments are then guided through a stretching unit, which comprises a plurality of stretching rollers for example,   in  order  finally  to  be  wound  up  into  a  reel.<br>
When  thermoplastic  filaments  are  being  spun,   things  that  have a  crucial  influence  on  the  quality  of  the  filaments  are  the uniform  temperature  of  the  melt  and  the  dwell  time  of  the  melt m  the  apparatus.   It  has  proved  advantageous   for  the temperature  of  the  melt  to  be  kept  as  near  constant  as possible  during  its  passage.   For  this  purpose,   it   is  necessary for  the  components  of  the  apparatus  through  which  the  melt passes  to  be  heated  to  counteract   any  loss  of  heat  through  the components  into  the  surroundings.   As  a  rule,   this  is  done  by arranging  the  components  through  which  the  melt  passes  in  the heating  box.<br>
In  this  way,   DE  19g  24   946  Al  proposes  a  spinning  bar  having  a heating  box,   the  heating  box  comprising  essentially  two elongated  heating  chambers   into  which  a  heating  medium,   such as  diphyl  vapour  for  example,   is  introduced.   The  spinnerets, which  are  arranged  in  a  row,   and  the  spinning  pump  are arranged  between  those   surfaces  of   the   two  heating  chambers which  face  one  another.   There   is  also  a  thermally  insulating cover  provided  above   the  spinning  pump.   Both  the  spinning  pump and  the  spinnerets  are   thus  heated  up  laterally  by  the  two<br>
heating  chambers.   Furthermore,   there  is  arranged  between  the spinning  pump  and  the  spinnerets  what  is  termed  a  pump  block, which  is  of  gas-tight  design  and  which  is  filled  with  a heating  medium.   The  pump  block  produces  an  equalisation  of temperature  between  all  the  adjacent  components,   thus  enabling the  aim  of  a  uniform  temperature  of  the  melt  during  its passage  through  the  components  to  be  achieved.<br>
A  piece  of  apparatus  for  spinning  filaments  is  also  known  from DE   198   09   495  Al   and  in  this  case  the  heating  box  simply  forms a  chamber,   with  the  melt   line,   the  distributing  lines  and  the spinnerets  being  arranged  in  the  heating  box.   The  heating  box is  heated  by  a  medium  in  vapour  form.   In  contrast  to  the  prior art  described  above,   the  spinning  pump  is  not  arranged  inside the  heating  box  but  on  the  outside  of  the  heating  box.   This enables   the   spinning  pump  to  be  serviced  or  repaired  more easily  in  the  event  of  a  fault  in  its  operation.   The  heating of  the  spinning  pump  is  accomplished  in  this  case  by  the transmission  of  heat   through  the  wall  of  the  heating  box.   This however  produces  inadequate  heating  of  the  spinning  pump, which  means   that   a   constant   temperature   is  not  obtained  for the  melt  during  its  passage.<br>
To  overcome   this  problem,   DE   199   24   83 8  Al  proposes   a   spinning apparatus  for  spinning  melted  polymers  in  which  a  spinning<br>
pump, which  is  connected  to  the  heating  box  via  a  supporting structure,   is  surrounded  by  a  heating  jacket  which  is  solidly connected  to  the  supporting  structure.   The  purpose  served  by the  supporting  structure  in  this  case  is  to  space  the  spinning pump  away  from  the  heating  box  so  that  the  two  regions  are decoupled  thermally.   The  intention  is  for  the  spinning  pump  to be  heated  solely  by  the  heating  jacket  which  surrounds  it.   The heating  box  and  heating  jacket  may  be  heated  both  in  unison and  by  mectns  of  separate  heating  circuits.<br>
The  prior  art  described  above  has  the  disadvantage  either  that there  is  no  guarantee  of  a  constant  temperature  for  the  melt during  its  passage  through  the  components  or  that   it  is  more difficult   for  the  spinning  pump  to  be  repaired  or  stripped  out in  the  event  of  a  failure.   What  is  meant  by  a  failure  is,   in particular,   a  leak  at  the  spinning  pump  itself  or  at   the transitions  between  the  spinning  pump  and  the  melt   line  or  the distributing  lines,   or  a  fault   in  the  spinning  pump.<br>
The  object  underlying  the  present   invention  is  thus  to  provide an  apparatus   for  spinning  filaments  which  ensures  a  constant temperature  for  the  melt  during  the  passage  of  the  melt through  the  components  and  which  simplifies  the  repair  of   the mating  surface  with  the  spinning  arrangement  and  the  pump  and<br>
the  stripping  out  of  the  spinning  pump  in  the  event  of  a failure.<br>
This  object  is  achieved  in  accordance  with  the  invention  by virtue  of  the  features   specified  in  claim  1.   Advantageous embodiments  of  the  invention  form  the  subject  matter  of  the sub-claims.<br>
The  apparatus  according  to  the  invention  for  spinning filaments  has  a  heating  box.   What  may  be   introduced  into  a heating  box  of  this  kind  is  for  example  a  heating  medium  in vapour  form  which  is -fed  out  of  the  heating  box  again  within  a circuit.  Arranged  in  the  heating  box  are  a  plurality  of spinnerets,   what   is   to  be  understood  by  this  being  that  the spinnerets  may  be  inset  both  directly  into  the  heating  box  and also  into  a  depression  in  the  wall  of  the  heating  box.   Also, there   is  a  spinning  pump  arranged  on  the  outside  of  the heating  box.   This  may  for  example  be  a  planetary-geared  pump having  one  inlet  and  a  plurality  of  outlets.   Provided  in addition  to  this  are  a  melt  line  leading  to  the  spinning  pump, a  plurality  of   distributing   lines   leading   from  the   spinning pump  to  the  spinnerets,   and  a  heating  jacket  surrounding  the spinning  pump.   In  accordance  with  the   invention,   the  heating jacket   is  detachably  mounted  on  the  heating  box  and  fastened thereto.<br>
The  apparatus  according  to  the  invention  has  the  advantage  on the  one  hand  that  the  spinning  pump  can  be  heated  to  an adequate  degree  by  the  heating  jacket,   thus  ensuring  that  the temperature  of  the  melt  is  constant  during  the  passage  of  the melt  through  the  components,   and  on  the  other  hand  that  in  the event  of  a  failure  the  spinning  pump  can  be  stripped  out easily  and  the  pump  and  the  sealing  surface  on  the  heating  box can  be  repaired  easily.   In  this  way,   the  heating  jacket,   which is  detachably  fastened  to  the  heating  box,   can  be  taken  off  in the  event  of  a  breakdown  in  the  operation  of  the  spinning pump,   thus  making  the  spinning  pump  and  the  mating  surface (sealing  surface)   easily  accessible.   The  apparatus  also affords  a  benefit  in  the  event  of  a  leak,   which  may  occur particularly  at   the  transitions  between  the   spinning  pump  and the  melt  line  or  the  distributing  lines.   In  this  case  the space  enclosed  by  the  heating  jacket   fills  with  the  melt   that leaks  out,   which  hardens  there.   To  enable  the  hardened material  to  be  removed  together  with  the  spinning  pump,   it   is merely  necessary  for  the  heating  jacket  and  the  spinning  pump to  be  detached  and  taken  off.   The  removal  of  the  hardened material   from  the  heating  jacket  and  from  the  spinning  pump can  then  be  performed  elsewhere,   while  a  new  spinning  pump  and a  new  heating  jacket   can  be  fitted  to  the  apparatus  to  ensure that  the  apparatus  can  go  on  operating  and  to  minimise downtimes.<br>
In  an  advantageous  embodiment  of  the  invention  the  heating jacket  is  fastened  to  the  heating  box  by  means  of  screws  or bolts.   It  is  particularly  preferable  for  the  heating  box  to  be fastened  to  the  heating  box  by  means  of  point  welds,   because point  welds  on  the  one  hand  produce  the  requisite  fastening and  on  the  other  hand  allow  the  heating  jacket  to  be  detached easily  from  the  heating  box.   The  spot  welds  can  be  destroyed with  simple  tools.<br>
In  a  particularly  preferred  embodiment  of  the  apparatus according  to  the  invention,   the  heating  box  has  a  carrier plate  which  is  mounted  on  the  outside  and  on  which  and  to which  the  spinning  pump  and  the  heating  jacket   are  mounted  and fastened.   It  is  particularly  easy  for  an  apparatus  of  this kind  to  be  produced  because  the  carrier  plate  can  be  produced and  worked  on  separately  from  the  rest  of   the  heating  box. This  is  an  advantage   in  that  the  carrier  plate,   which  does   in fact  form  the  mating  surface  for  the  spinning  pump,   needs  to be  produced  with  great  accuracy  to  enable   the  spinning pump  to  be  sealed  without  additional   sealing  materials  and to   stop  the  melt   from  escaping.     A  high  standard  of sealing  is   thus   ensured  for  the  apparatus.<br>
In  a  further  preferred  embodiment  of  the   invention,   the carrier  plate  has  a   surrounding  collar  which  projects  outwards<br>
radially.   The  surrounding  collar,   on  which  the  heating  jacket is  mounted  and  to  which  it  is  fastened,   is  spaced  away  from the  surface  of  the  heating  box.   In  this  way,   the  heating jacket  remains  largely  unaffected  thermally  by  the  heating box,   which  means  that  the  two  heating  circuits  are  easy  to control.  The  invention  does  not  however  rule  out  the possibility  of  the  heating  jacket  and  heating  box  having  a common  heating  circuit.<br>
In  a  further  advantageous  embodiment  of  the   invention,   there are  preferably  provided  in  the  carrier  plate  an  inlet  opening for  the  infeed  of  melt   to  the  spinning  pump  via  the  melt   line and  a  plurality  of  outlet  openings  for  the  outfeed  of  the  melt from  the  spinning  pump  into  the  distributing  lines.<br>
To  enable  not  only  the  spinning  pump  and  the  spinneret  but also  the  other  components  of  the  apparatus   to  be  heated,   the distributing  lines  and  at  least  part  of  the  melt  line  are arranged  in  the  heating  box  in  a  particularly  preferred embodiment  of  the  apparatus  according  to  the  invention.   In this  way,   the  temperature  of  the  melt   is  kept   at  a  constant level   during  the  entire  passage  of  the  melt,   namely  within  the lines  as  well.<br>
To  enable  that  portion  of  the  melt  line  which  extends  between the  heating  box  and  the  melt  infeed  means   (e.g.   an  extruder) to  be  heated  as  well,   the  heating  box  has  a  tubular, projecting  extension  through  which  the  melt  line  extends.   It is  thus  inside  the  tubular  extension,   which  forms  part  of  the heating  box,   that  the  melt  line  is  run  to  that  region  of  the heating  box  in  which  the  spinnerets  are  situated.   In  this  way the  melt,   on  its  way  from  the  melt  infeed  means  to  the spinning  pump,   does  not  change  to  a  temperature  which  is  lower than  in  the  other  parts  of  the  apparatus.<br>
The  heating  jacket   is  preferably  in  the  form  of  a  twin-tube jacket  and  has  an  inlet  and  an  outlet   for  a  heating  medium. What   is  meant  by  a  twin-tube  jacket   is  a  jacket  of  which  the inside  is  formed  by  a  first  tube  of   smaller  diameter  and  of which  the  outside  is  formed  by  a  second  tube  of  larger diameter,   with  an  intervening  space  being  formed  between  the two.<br>
To  make  it  easier  for  the  spinnerets  to  be  fitted  and  removed, the   latter  are   arranged,   in  a  particularly  preferred embodiment  of  the   invention,   within  a  row  of  outward  facing depressions   in  the  heating  chamber,   the  row  of  depressions being  enclosed  by  the  space  within  the  heating  box.   This latter  fact  means   that,   inside  the  heating  box,   the  heating<br>
medium  is  able  to  surround  the  depressions  and  is  thus  able  to effect  highly  uniform  heating  of  the  spinnerets  inserted therein.<br>
In  a  particularly  advantageous  embodiment  of  the  apparatus according  to  the  invention,   the  heating  box  and  the  heating jacket  each  have  heating  circuits  of  their  own.   In  this  way  it is  possible   for  the  components  to  be  heated  differently,   thus enabling  a  possible  difference  in  temperature,   which  arises for  example  due  to  differences  in  pressure  in  the  components, to  be  counteracted  by  appropriate  controlling  action.<br>
In  what   follows,   the  invention  will  be  explained  in  more detail  by  reference  to  an  illustrative  embodiment  and  to  the accompanying  drawings .-<br>
In  the  drawings:<br>
Fig.   1	is   a  partial   side  elevation,   in  section,   of  the<br>
apparatus  according  to  the  invention  and<br>
Fig.   2	is  a  perspective  view  of  the  apparatus  of  Fig.   1.<br>
Fig.   1  is  ci  partial  view  of  the  apparatus  according  to  the invention.   To  provide  a  better  understanding,   Fig.   2   is  a perspective  view  of  the  apparatus  of   Fig.1  ,   certain  of  the<br>
components  shown  in  Fig.   1  having  been  omitted  in  this  case from  considerations  of  clarity.<br>
The  apparatus  2  for  spinning  filaments  has,   in  essence,   an extruder  4  or  other  melt-producing  unit,   such  for  example  as  a reaction  vessel,   a  spinning  bar  6  and,   connected  downstream,   a plurality  of  means  for  applying  further  processing  to  the filaments  produced,   the  means  connected  downstream  not  having been  shown.   The  spinning  bar  6  comprises  essentially  a  heating box  8,   one  or  more  spinning  pumps  10,   only  one  of  which  is shown,   a  plurality  of  spinnerets  12,   which  have  not  been  shown in  Fig.   2,   and  a  heating  jacket   14   for  each  of  the  spinning pumps   10.<br>
The  heating  box  8  has  at  least  one  inlet  and  one  outlet   (not shown)   for  a  heating  medium,   such  for  example  as  diphyl vapour,   so  that  the  heating  medium  can  make  its  way  into  the enclosed  space  16  within  the  heating  box  8.   Provided  in  the filament  exit  side  of  the  heating  box  8   is  a  row  of cylindrical  or  quadrilateral  depressions  18  which  face outwards   (Fig.   2).   The  spinnerets   12  are  arranged  in  the depressions,   which  means  that   the  spinnerets   12   are,   in  a sense,   arranged  in  the  heating  box  8  without  however  being arranged  directly  in  the   space   16  within  the  heating  box  8. The  row  of  depressions   18   is  surrounded  by  the  space   16  within<br>
the  heating  box  8,   thus  enabling  the  spinnerets  12   to  be heated  by  the  heating  medium  through  the  walls  of  the depressions  18.<br>
The  heating  box  8  also  has  a  tubular,   projecting  extension  20 which  encloses  a  space  22  which  is  in  flow-permitting connection  with  the  space  16  within  the  heating  box  8.   The tubular  extension  20  extends  as  far  as  the  extruder  4,   where it   is  sealed  off  at   the  end  face  to  prevent   the  heating  medium from  escaping.<br>
On  the  side  of  the  heating  box  8  remote  from  the  depressions 18   is  provided  a  carrier  plate  24  which  is  mounted  on  from outside.   The  carrier  plate  24   is  circular  in  configuration  and is  fastened  in  place  in  a  circular  aperture  26   in  the  heating box  8  in  such  a  way  as  to  ensure  that  the  latter  is  sealed., Through  the  carrier  plate  24   extend  an  inlet  opening  28  and  a plurality  of  outlet  openings  30.   Provided  on  the  side  of  the carrier  plate  24   remote  from  the  heating  box  8   is  a surrounding  collar  3 2  which  projects  outwards  radially.   The collar  32  thus  forms  a  sort  of   flange.   The  collar  32   is  spaced away   (a)   from  the  surface  of  the  heating  box  8,   as  can  be  seen in  particular  in  Fig.   1.   Also,   there  is  provided  in  the  face of   the  carrier  plate   24   which  faces  outwards   a  groove   34<br>
extending  round  in  a  circle  which  surrounds  a  mating  surface 36.<br>
The  spinning  pump  10,   which  may  for  example  be  a  planetary-geared  pump,   is  arranged on  the  outside  of  the  heating  box  8. This  being  the  case,   it  is  fastened  to  the  mating  surface  36 of  the  carrier  plate  24   in  such  a  way  that  liquid  melt  can make  its  way  through  the  inlet  opening  28  and  into  the spinning  pump  10  and  can  emerge  again  through  the  outlet openings  30.   The  spinning  pump  10  is  also  surrounded  laterally by  the  heating  jacket   14,   in  which  case  there  should  also  be  a cover  provided  at   the  top  but  this  has  not  been  shown  from considerations  of  greater  clarity.<br>
The  heating  jacket   14   is   in  the  form  of  what   is  termed  a  twin-tube  jacket,   i.e.   it:  comprises  in  essence  an  inner  tube  3 8  and an  outer  tube  40,   between  which  is  located  an  annular  space  4 2 for  a  heating  medium.   Where  the  heating  is  electrical,   use  is made  of  only  a  single  tube  which  is  surrounded  by  heating bands.   The  ends  of  this  space  42  are  closed  off  to  ensure  that it   is  sealed.   The  heating  jacket  14  also  has  an  inlet  44  and an  outlet  46   for  the  heating  medium.   The  heating  medium  may  be carried  in  a  circuit,   (not   shown)   which  may  be  connected  to  the heating  circuit   for  the  heating  box  8  but  which  preferably takes  the  form  of  a  separate  heating  circuit.<br>
The  heating  jacket  14  is  detachably  mounted  on  and  fastened  to the  heating  box  8.   In  the  present  embodiment,   the  heating jacket  14   is  detachably  mounted  on  and  fastened  to  the  carrier plate  24  of  the  heating  box  8,   or  to  be  more  exact  on  and  to the  collar  32  of  the  carrier  plate  24.   The  detachable fastening  is  advantageously  accomplished  by  means  of  spaced point  welds  48  between  the  collar  32  of  the  carrier  24  and  the heating  jacket  14.   On  the  one  hand  the  point  welds  48  ensure that  the  heating  jacket   is  securely  held  in  place  and  on  the other  hand  they  enable  it   to  be  detached  easily  with conventional  tools.   Detachable  fastening  may  of  course  also  be accomplished  with  screws  or  bolts  or  the  like  but   the  method shown  is  preferred  for  the  reasons  given  above.<br>
The  apparatus  2  also  has  at  least  one  melt  line  50  per spinning  pump  10.   Starting  from  the  extruder  4,   the  melt  line 50  extends  through  the  tubular  extension  20  and  into  the  space 16  within  the  heating  box  8,   where  it  opens  into  the  inlet opening  28   in  the  carrier  plate  24.   Also  extending  through  the space   16  within  the  heating  box  8  are  a  plurality  of distributing  lines  52  which,   starting  from  the  outlet  openings 30   in  the  carrier  plate  24,   run  to  the  spinnerets   12.in the  depressions  18.   To  enable  connections  to  be  made  between<br>
the  distributing  lines  52  and  the  spinnerets   12,   suitable openings  54  are  provided  in  the  walls  of  the  depressions 18.<br>
The  way  in  which  the  apparatus  2  operates  will  be  described  in what  follows.   The  extruder  4  extrudes  the  melt  into  the  melt line  50,   which  is  heated  by  the  heating  medium   (not  shown)   in the  space  22  in  the  tubular  extension  20  and  in  the  space  16 within  the  heating  box  8.   Via  the  melt  line  50,   the  melt  makes its  way  into  the   spinning  pump  10.   The  spinning  pump  10   is heated  by  the  heating  jacket   14   surrounding  it.   Via  the distributing  lines   52,   the  melt  is  finally  fed  to  the spinnerets   12,   from  which  the  melt  emerges   in  the  form  of  a large  number  of  individual   filaments  56  to  then  be  subjected to  further  processing.<br>
Occasionally,   breakdowns  in  the  operation  of  an  apparatus  for spinning  filaments  are  due  to  a  leak  at  the  spinning  pump  or in  the  region  of  the  point  of  connection  between  the  spinning pump  and  heating  box.   In  the  embodiment  shown,   the  apparatus according  to  the  invention  counteracts  this  possibility firstly  in  that  a  carrier  plate  24   is  provided  which  is mounted  on  from  outside,   i.e.   which  is  first  produced  as  a separate,   individual  part.   Because  the  carrier  plate  24  can first   be  produced  as   a   separate   individual   part,   it   is possible   for  the  mating   surface   36   for  the   spinning  pump   10   tobe  produced  with  substantially  greater  accuracy  before  the carrier  plate  24  is  mounted  on  the  heating  box.   In  particular, this  counteracts  the  possibility  of  a  leak  at  the  point  of connection  between  the  carrier  plate  24  and  the  spinning  pump 10.<br>
If  a  leak  occurs  in  conventional  pieces  of  apparatus,   the  melt escapes  in  the  region  of  the  spinning  pump  and  then  hardens. It   is  then  a  very  difficult  matter  both  to  strip  out  the spinning  pump  and  to  repair  it.   By  contrast,   the  apparatus according  to  the  invention  has  the  advantage  that  the detachable  heating  jacket   14,   together  with  the  melt  that  has hardened  in  it  and  the  spinning  pump  10   surrounded  by  it,   can be  detached,   to  enable  it  to  be  removed  easily  and  repaired elsewhere.   In  the  meantime,   a  new  spinning  pump  and  a  new heating  jacket  can  straightaway  be  fitted  onto  the  spinning bar  6   to  enable  the  apparatus  2   to  continue  in  operation.   The detachment  of  the  point  welds  48  can  be  accomplished  by applying  a  lever  or  wedge  to  them.<br>
The  operation  of   the  heating  box  8   and  heating  jacket   14   by means  of  mutually  divorced  heating  circuits  also  enables   those components  which  may  generate  different  temperatures  due  to the  ways  in  which  they  operate  to  be  heated  independently.  "In this  way,   the  temperature  inside  the  spinning  pump  10   forexample  rises  more  sharply  due  to  the  high  pressure  therein, which  means  that  a  difference  in  temperature  may  arise  between the  melt  in  the  melt  line  50  and  the  melt   in  the  spinning  pump 10.   Hence,   by  a  difference  in  heating,   it  can  be  ensured  that the  temperature  of  the  melt   is  constant  during  its  passage through  the  components.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
