				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
HETEROGENEOUS CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING OXIRANE<br>
COMPOUND WITH THE CATALYST<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]    The present invention relates to an industrial process for producing oxirane compound useful as starting material for epoxy resins used for adhesive or electronic material, or in architectural field, or the like, or for heat resistant polymers, and as an intermediate for Pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]    Several documents report epoxidation process with hydrogen peroxide by using as catalyst, heteropolyacid prepared separately and a quaternary ammonium salt being a phase transfer catalyst (see, for example, J. Org. Chem., Vol. 53, p. 1553-1557 (1988) and J. Org. Chem., Vol. 53, p. 3587-3595 (1988)).   The epoxidation process yields only water other than the product and therefore is a very clean oxidation reaction.<br>
[0003]     However, the above-mentioned process is not necessarily a satisfactory industrial production process from reason that it uses solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, benzene or the like that are not used in ordinary industrial production processes, and the like.   In addition, in the above-mentioned documents, although oxidation catalysts are prepared by using alkyl ammonium salt such as methyltrioctyl ammonium chloride, the oxidation catalysts have a high partition coefficient for organic solvents, and it is difficult to separate with products dissolved in organic solvents.   Therefore, the process has problems in the separation and re-use of oxidation catalyst.<br>
[0004]    On the other hand, is also reported a process for making an oxidation catalyst heterogeneous by using an inorganic compound such as silica gel as a carrier (see, for example, JP 2001-17863 A and JP 2001-17864 A).   This process requires an expensive silane coupling agent or the like as an auxiliary substance for heterogenization, and therefore is not necessarily a satisfactory process.    Industrially, further preferable oxidation catalysts are desired.<br>
[0005]    Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing oxirane compounds which is clean and industrially useful, and an olefin<br>
oxidation catalyst which is excellent in separability from a reaction solution and reusability.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0006]    The present inventors eagerly studied in order to resolve the problems. Consequently, they found that reactions for producing oxirane with hydrogen peroxide proceed also in any solvent system normally used in industrial use by preparing an olefin oxidation catalyst from an organic compound or a polymer compound, a tungstic acid compound, phosphoric acid, hydrogen peroxide and a quaternary ammonium salt, and using the oxidation catalyst, or by preparing an olefin oxidation catalyst from an organic compound or a polymer compound, a tungsten compound and a quaternary ammonium salt, and using the oxidation catalyst, and that the oxidation catalysts exert heterogenization effect without using any auxiliary substance such as silane coupling agent or the like, and can be separated from reaction system and reused due to a low solubility in organic solvents and water, and they completed the present invention.<br>

the reaction, and includes aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene<br>

acetonitrile, butyronitrile and the like, amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide, and the like, ureas such as N.N'-dimethylimidazolidinone, and the<br>
like, water, and mixtures of these solvents.   Water, aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons, and mixtures of these solvents are preferable.<br>
[0051]    The temperature for warming is 40 to 80°C.<br>
[0052]    Next, the olefin oxidation catalyst prepared from the organic compound or<br>
polymer compound of formula (1), a tungsten compound, and the quaternary<br>
ammonium salt of formula (2) or (3) according to the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
[0053]     The oxidation catalyst can be produced by dispersing the organic<br>
compound or polymer compound of formula (1) in a solution of the quaternary<br>
ammonium salt of formula (2) or (3) diluted with a solvent, and adding dropwise an<br>
aqueous solution of the tungsten compound therein, or by dispersing the organic<br>
compound or polymer compound of formula (1) in an aqueous solution of the tungsten<br>

[0055]    The used amount of tungsten compound is 0.2 to 0.5 molar equivalent<br>
based on the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (2) or (3).<br>
[0056]    The solvent used is not specifically limited so long as it does not take part in<br>
the reaction, and includes aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene<br>
and the like, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, dodecane, and the like,<br>
halogen-containing solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane,<br>
and the like, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like, nitriles such as<br>

[0058]    The olefin oxidation catalyst according to the present invention prepared by<br>
the above-mentioned production process is generally insoluble in the solvent.<br>
Therefore, the olefin oxidation catalyst can be isolated by removing the solvent and<br>
aqueous phase after reaction.<br>
[0059]     In the meanwhile, a solution prepared by dissolving the olefin oxidation<br>
catalyst in a solvent can be used as such for the production of oxirane compounds of<br>

[0060]     In case where the used solvent is aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene,<br>
xylene or the like, or aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane, dodecane or the<br>
like, the resulting olefin oxidation catalyst is generally insoluble in the solvent, and<br>
therefore the reaction solution forms three phases composed of an aqueous phase,<br>
an organic phase and a catalyst phase.<br>
[0061]     In this case, after reaction, the removal of the aqueous and organic phases<br>
enables the olefin oxidation catalyst to be isolated.<br>
[0062]    Also in case where water is used as a solvent, the resulting olefin oxidation<br>
catalyst is generally insoluble in the solvent, and therefore the filtration or the removal<br>
of water enables the olefin oxidation catalyst to be isolated.<br>
[0063]    As to the structure of the olefin oxidation catalyst prepared from the organic<br>
compound or polymer compound of formula (1), a tungstic acid compound,<br>
phosphoric acid, hydrogen peroxide and the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (2)<br>
or (3), from the indication of J. Org. Chem., Vol. 53, p. 1553-1557 (1988), it is<br>
suggested that the compound having the following structure may be adsorbed by or<br>
dissolved in the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1) and the<br>
resulting catalyst may be heterogenized.<br>

 [0064]     On the other hand, as to the structure of the olefin oxidation catalyst prepared from the olefin oxidation catalyst prepared from the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1), a tungsten compound and the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (2) or (3), from the indication of J. Org. Chem., Vol. 53, p. 3587-3593 (1988), it is suggested that the compound having the following structure may be adsorbed by or dissolved in the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1) and the resulting catalyst may be heterogenized.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
[0065]     Next, the process for producing the oxirane compound of formula (5) with<br>
the olefin oxidation catalyst will be described.<br>
[0066]    According to the present invention, the oxirane compound of formula (5) can<br>
be produced by treating the olefins of formula (4) in an organic solvent with hydrogen<br>
peroxide in the presence of the olefin oxidation catalyst of the present invention.<br>
[0067]    The used amount of the olefin oxidation catalyst of the present invention is<br>
0.03 to 15 mol% based on the olefin of formula (4) in term of the used amount of the<br>
quaternary ammonium salt used in the production of the olefin oxidation catalyst of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0068]    The solvent used is not specifically limited so long as it does not take part in<br>
the reaction, and includes aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene<br>
and the like, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, dodecane, and the like,<br>
ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like, nitriles such as acetonitrile,<br>
butyronitrile and the like, amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-<br>
dimethylacetamide, and the like, ureas such as N.N'-dimethylimidazolidinone, and the<br>
like, and mixtures of these solvents.   Aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons,<br>
and mixtures of these solvents are preferable.<br>
[0069]    The reaction temperature is 0 to 150°C, but it is preferable for the synthesis<br>
of oxirane compounds that the reaction temperature is 90°C or less.<br>
[0070]    Although pH in the reaction system is not specifically limited, it is preferably<br>
0.5 to 7.<br>
[0071]    The control of pH in the reaction system can be carried out by adding a<br>
proper amount of phosphoric acid aqueous solution or sodium oxide aqueous solution<br>
while confirming pH with a pH meter.<br>
[0072]    The reaction can be carried out under normal pressure or pressure.<br>
[0073]    After the completion of the reaction, an organic phase containing products<br>
and the catalyst used can be easily separated by filtration process.   Then, the<br>
reaction products can be purified by distillation and column chromatography to obtain<br>
an aimed product.<br>
[0074]    As the present reaction uses an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide<br>
(hydrogen peroxide solution), in case where any solvent insoluble in water is used, an<br>
organic phase and an aqueous phase are separated.   In this case, the olefin<br>
oxidation catalyst of the present invention has generally a low solubility in organic<br>
solvents and does not have a high solubility in water.   Therefore, in many cases, the<br>
reaction proceeds in a state which is separated into three phases composed of an<br>
organic phase, a catalyst phase and an aqueous phase.<br>
[0075]    As the catalyst is little dissolved in the organic phase, the solution of the<br>
oxirane compound of formula (5) can be obtained by only taking out the organic phase<br>
after the completion of the reaction.<br>
[0076]    That is, the preparation of the olefin oxidation catalyst by use of the organic<br>
compound or polymer compound of formula (1) can make the separation of the olefin<br>
oxidation catalyst easy.<br>
[0077]    In addition, the oxirane compound of formula (5) can be produced again by<br>
adding the olefin compound of formula (4) and hydrogen peroxide to the oxidation<br>
catalyst recovered with filtration after the completion of the reaction.<br>
[0078]    That is, the olefin oxidation catalyst can be re-used by using the production<br>
process of the present invention.<br>
[0079]     Further, in case where any solvent dissoluble in water is used, although the<br>
reaction is generally becomes homogeneous reaction, the separation and re-use of<br>
the olefin oxidation catalyst become possible as mentioned above by adding water<br>
and a solvent indissoluble in water to cause separation into phases.<br>
[0080]     Next, without separately preparing the olefin oxidation catalyst prepared<br>
from the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1), a tungstic acid<br>
compound, phosphoric acid, hydrogen peroxide and the quaternary ammonium salt of<br>
formula (2) or (3), the process for producing the oxirane compound of formula (5) will<br>
be described.<br>
[0081]    The above-mentioned production process is shown in the reaction scheme<br>
described below:<br>
Organic Compound or Polymer Compound of Formula (1)<br>
Quaternary Ammonium Salt<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the same meaning as the above.<br>
 [0082]    That is, the oxirane compound of formula (5) can be produced by treating the olefin compound of formula (4) in an organic solvent with the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1), tungstic acid, phosphoric acid, the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (2) or (3) and hydrogen peroxide.<br>
[0083] The adding order of the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1), tungstic acid, phosphoric acid, the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (2) or (3) and hydrogen peroxide used is not specifically limited.<br>
[0084] The used amount of the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1) is 1 to 200 g per 1 mmol of phosphoric acid.<br>
[0085]    The used amount of the quaternary ammonium salt is 0.003 to 0.15 molar equivalent based on the olefins of formula (4).<br>
[0086] The used amount of tungstic acid is 0.004 to 0.20 molar equivalent based on the olefins of formula (4).<br>
[0087]    The used amount of phosphoric acid is 0.001 to 0.05 molar equivalent based on the olefins of formula (4). <br>
[0088]    As the hydrogen peroxide used, commercially available aqueous solution<br>
can be used as such or in a diluted state, and the used amount thereof is 0.5 to 3 molar equivalents, preferably 0.8 to 1.5 molar equivalent based on the olefins of formula (4).<br>
[0089]    In the meanwhile, as to the reaction condition, the reaction can be carried out similarly to those in the production process of oxirane compounds of formula (5) by use of the oxidation catalyst prepared from the organic compound or polymer compound of formula (1), a tungstic acid compound, phosphoric acid, hydrogen peroxide and the quaternary ammonium salt of formula (2) or (3). <br>
[0090]     In addition, the isolation and purification of the products, and the separation and re-use of the olefin oxidation catalyst can be also carried out similarly to those in the production process of oxirane compounds of formula (5) by use of the olefin oxidation catalyst according to the present invention.<br>
[0091] The organic compounds of formula (1) used in the present invention can be produced according to known methods, for example the methods indicated in Nippon Kagaku Kaishi, Vol. 1999 (No. 2), pp.173-178 and Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., p.251 (1972). [0092] The quaternary ammonium salts of formula (2) used in the present invention can be produced according to the general synthetic method of quaternary ammonium salts as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
That is, the quaternary ammonium salts of formula (2) can be produced by reacting<br>
pyridines (6) with alkyl halides (7).<br>
[0093]     In addition, the salt of the quaternary ammonium salt can be exchanged by<br>
using an ion exchange resin or the like.<br>
[0094]    As the quaternary ammonium salts of formula (3) used in the present<br>
invention, commercially available ones can be used.<br>
[0095]    The polyimides composed of the repeating unit of formula (8) among the<br>
polymer compounds used in the present invention can be produced according to<br>
known methods, for example methods indicated in US Patent No. 3489725 and JP 6-<br>
136120 A.<br>
[0096]    As polymer compounds such as other polyimides, acrylamides,<br>
methacrylamides, polyamides, polyurethane and the like, commercially available products can be used.<br>
