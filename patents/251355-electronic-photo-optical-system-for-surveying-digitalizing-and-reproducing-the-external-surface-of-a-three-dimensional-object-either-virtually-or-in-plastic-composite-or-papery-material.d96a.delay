				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electronic photo-optical system capable of surveying the external outline any kind of object and transform it into a set of Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z); transmitting the mathematical data of these geometries via networks both to a personal computer (to realize a three-dimensional graphical representation of the object and render possible the further processing of its geometry by means of three-dimensional, computer-assisted design, CAD 3D) and directly to an on-line device of the fax-reproducer type for the reproduction in plastic, composite or papery material of the volume of the surveyed object, in an automatic manner and in accordance with a predetermined logic, composite material being here understood as referring to a material obtained by the union of at least two components having chemical and physical characteristics such as to render them different, insoluble and capable of being separated from each other.<br>
Prior art<br>
The prior art relating to the transformation in a personal computer of the outline of any kind of surveyed and digitalized object into the external surface of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual object consists principally of the use of lasers and feelers for -determining the space coordinates of the object or three-dimensional reconstruction by means of the acquisition of images from video cameras and video projectors.<br>
The prior art relating to the realization of an object in plastic material or other material by means of data obtained from a CAD 3D system comprises principally the use of lasers and milling cutters; rapid prototyping like stereolithography (SLA); laser sintering (SLS); the LOM method; the FDM method, the 3DP method; the SGC method. Furthermore, the prior art comprises the device for thermoforming, digitalizing and reproducing the external surface of an object in three-dimensions, virtually and/or in<br>
thermoformable plastic material, object of Italian Patent Application No. MI 2003 A 000177 and International Application No..PCT/EP 04/00855, in which an integrated module for the calculation and management of information technology (IT) data, a scanner module and a reproduction module are capable of thermoforming external surfaces of objects from panels (sheets) of thermoformable plastic material without having to rely on negative or positive moulds, carrying out 3D scannings of pre-existing objects taken as model, translating them into the external surfaces of virtual objects that can be processed by means of CAD 3D programs, carrying out operations of remote reproduction by means of 3D fax of previously digitalized surfaces or surfaces of objects designed by means of CAD 3D and conserved in a data base, in the form of surfaces of objects thermoformed in thermoplastic material.<br>
Disadvantages of the prior art<br>
The disadvantages of the prior art consist of the very considerable sophistication associated with the conventional scanners and 3D reproducers, with consequent high costs of first purchase and maintenance, which relegate these products to a very restricted and very sectoral market area, principally concentrated in the compartment of fast prototyping for mechanical design and architecture.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The symbols used in the present description are explained in the following<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The device VT n consists of modules interfaced with each other and capable of virtually acquiring and materially reproducing the external surfaces of any kind of object obj.<br>
The scanning module VT-MS u acquires the external coordinates of the outlines of the objects obj subjected to surveying, translating them into an ordered set of three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.<br>
This information, ordered into a specific numerical matrix, can be utilized for the purposes of carrying out the following operations:<br>
a)	Reproduction of the object obj subjected to scanning in plastic, composite or<br>
papery material: direct passage from the scanning module VT-MS " to the reproduction<br>
module VT-MF ", without intervention to modify the originally acquired data;<br>
b)	Reproduction of the object obj subjected to scanning as view of a 3D virtual<br>
object obj in a PC: direct passage from the scanning module VT-MS u to a PC to be<br>
available for both viewing and modification in a three-dimensional computer-assisted<br>
design environment;<br>
c)	Reproduction in plastic, composite or papery material of the object obj<br>
subjected to scanning and modified in a PC or of a virtual object obj designed by means<br>
of CAD 3D: direct passage from a PC to reproduction module VT-MF n (Mod. A<br>
printing and/or Mod. B printing).<br>
Informatics interfaces of the following types may be created with the device:<br>
-	type 10/100 ethernet board;<br>
-	modem board;<br>
serial communication port; USB port; wireless network transmission board.<br>
These solutions assure every type of dialogue between the systems for data transmission and reception; in particular, using the modem board on the scanning device (VT-MS n) and on the reproduction device (VT-MF u), direct on-line transmission can be realized between the devices (case [a] of the preceding paragraph) and this makes it possible to regard the former as a transmitting fax and the latter as a receiving fax interlinked for automatic reception.<br>
With a view to making full use of the capacities of the module systems of the device VT n, the CAD 3D systems are equipped with specific softwares (VT n<br>
softwares) capable of generating files having a format compatible with the reproduction system VT-MF ", thus making possible the three-dimensional reproduction of objects obj generated entirely by means of CAD 3D and/or modified by information received from the scanning module VT-MS ".<br>
The electronic photo-optical system VT u for digitalizing and reproducing the outline of an object obj in three-dimensions, virtually and/or in plastic, composite or papery material, is characterized in that it comprises:<br>
A - Module VT-Data ": integrated mathematical calculation module for managing informatics data that describe the mathematical logic employed by the hardware present in the modules B and C;<br>
B - Module VT-MS n: scanner module for acquisition of the three-dimensional space coordinates of any kind of surface;<br>
C - Module VT-MF n: fax-type reproduction module for realizing the three-dimensional outline of scanned surfaces (case B) or of purely virtual surfaces designed in a CAD 3D environment;<br>
said modules being capable of carrying out the operations of:<br>
1	Surveying, by means of a digital photo camera or a digital survey and image<br>
acquisition system, the external surface and the associated colour information of any<br>
kind of object obj subjected to scanning, obtaining the numerical matrix of the space<br>
coordinates of the object obj of type 3Dr and type 3Dc;<br>
2	Generating files compatible with the CAD 3D standards to render the object<br>
obj that has been scanned and acquired (as in  1  above) visible in a CAD 3D<br>
environment by rendering its surfaces, thus making it possible to intervene and process<br>
the data to modify parts of the object obj and/or to add some new ones, and eventually,<br>
by means of specific VT n drivers, generate the dedicated files that can be directly interpreted by the reproduction module VT-MF ";<br>
3	Generating record files to be transferred to the data base of a PC and containing<br>
the mathematical data of the numerical matrices 3Dr and 3Dc of the scanned object obj<br>
(as per 1 and 2 above), so that they can subsequently be re-used not only for viewing<br>
and/or modification, but also for being sent to the reproduction module VT-MF n for<br>
being reproduced;<br>
4	Transferring the mathematical data of the numerical matrices 3Dr, 3Drrt and<br>
3Dc of the scanned object obj (as in 1 above) by means of modem from the scanner<br>
module VT-MS n to the reproduction module VT-MF n with a view to realizing the<br>
coloured outline of the scanned object obj in plastic, composite or papery material of<br>
appropriate formulation and creating one or more physical reproductions (Mod. A<br>
printing and/or Mod. B printing);<br>
5	Transferring the mathematical data of the numerical matrices 3Dr, 3Drrt and<br>
3Dc of the scanned object obj (as in 1, 2 and 3 above) or of a virtual object obj<br>
generated by means of a CAD 3D program from the data base of a PC to the<br>
reproduction module VT-MF " with a view to realizing the coloured outline of the object<br>
obj in plastic, composite or papery material of appropriate formulation and creating one<br>
or more physical reproductions (Mod. A printing and/or Mod. B printing).<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The advantages of the invented system are as follows:<br>
The scanner module VT-MS n consists of a digital photo camera or a digital survey and image acquisition system of common use, a rotating plane, a LED system mounted on a motor-controlled axis and an integrated hardware part, so that the set of parts<br>
constituting the scanner device gives rise to a component cost that is markedly less than the cost standards associated with present-day three-dimensional scanning equipment.<br>
In constructional terms, the reproduction module VT-MF " is comparable to the conventional multifunctional printing systems for office use, such as fax, scanner and photocopier. The overall cost of the device VT-MF " is markedly less than the cost of the present-day rapid prototyping technologies; furthermore, it employs consumption materials (of a plastic, composite or papery nature) that are likewise less costly than the materials (resins, fibres, powders, thermoplastic reagent gels, etc.) employed by the present-day prototyping systems; assuring also the colouring of the reproduced object.<br>
The low cost of the devices and the consumption material, together with the fact that the devices can be interfaced with the external systems, assure that both these devices can be commonly and easily used and render them particularly suitable for an office-type standard with the cost and use requirements peculiar of a consumer-type market.<br>

Detailed descriptions will now be provided of the following:<br>
1.	Integrated module for the mathematical calculation and management of the<br>
informatics data (VT-Data ");<br>
2.	Scanner module (VT-MS " )<br>
3.   Fax-reproduction module (VT-MF ").<br>
Module VT-Data ":<br>
The operating principle of the electronic photo-optical system VT " for the acquisition of the Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) of any kind of object obj is based on the mathematico-geometrical relationships between the object obj and the reference system.<br>
Description of the logic of the reference system:<br>
A. Acquisition of desired Cartesian coordinates (numerical matrices P, 3D, 3Dr and 3Dc):<br>
a)	Given a plane it on which the object obj is positioned, let said plane be<br>
rotatable about a point c, centre of rotation of n, with the axis of rotation perpendicular<br>
to the plane;<br>
b)	Position of the object obj with the condition that at least one point of the<br>
object obj should form part of the axis of rotation of it passing through c (as in [a]<br>
above);<br>
c)	Given a rotation of the plane n and the object obj resting on it about the axis<br>
of rotation, it follows that each point of the plane and the object obj describes a<br>
circumference having a radius equal to the distance between the generic point Pj and the<br>
projection of Pj onto the axis of rotation. Let the radius of rotation described by Pj be<br>
called RPj;<br>
d)	Given a second plane the exact description of which is defined by the<br>
matrix of the direction cosines of ml, positioned in space, let us consider the orthogonal<br>
projections of the circumferences described by the points on nl;<br>
e)	Since the projection of a circumference onto a non-parallel plane generates<br>
an ellipse, one concludes that: an observer at an observation point situated at infinity (i.e.<br>
a parallel-beam-type observer) with respect to the perpendicular passing through nl would see the circular motion of the point Pj as an elliptic motion;<br>
f)	Let us utilize the rototranslation equations of a reference system with the first<br>
system (x,y,z) situated at the centre c of the plane TI and the second reference system<br>
(X,Y,Z) positioned on the plane nl with the directrix Z coincident with the straight line<br>
passing through c of it and perpendicular to nl (directrix Z coincident with the straight<br>
line c-cl);<br>
g)	The matrix system associated with the rototranslation makes it possible to<br>
define coordinates from the system (x,y,z) to the system (X,Y,Z) and vice versa;<br>
h) The observer at infinity with respect to nl, who observes according to (X,Y,Z), is capable of deducing the exact positions on (x,y,z) by making use of the matrix equations. Given the positions X,Y on (X,Y,Z) and given also the position of the corresponding point z measured with respect to (x,y,z), the matrix system can be solved.<br>
B.     Description of the acquisition of the coordinates [x,y,z]:<br>
a)	Let the object obj be positioned on the base plane (u);<br>
b)	The initial position of the object obj with respect to the plane (n) and the<br>
digital image survey system (;rl) is defined with an angle equal to 0°;<br>
c)	A linear light beam projected parallel to the base plane (TT), initially strikes<br>
the object obj at a position such that z\ = vertical level = 0 + (beam thickness)/2;<br>
d)	The digital image survey system photographs (shoots) the object obj and<br>
associates the position of angle=0° and zj with this "instant image photogramme/frame";<br>
e)	Subsequently the digital image survey system produces a series of n "instant<br>
image photogrammes/frames" associated with positions of angle=0° and z\ with i =1: n<br>
corresponding to the levels zi = z\ + (p x i) for i =2 ... n, with p = vertical scanning step<br>
(electronically manageable parameter);<br>
f)	Following completion of the sequence at angle=0°, the base plane (TT) is<br>
made to rotate through angle=90°;<br>
g)	A sequence of n "instant image photogrammes/frames" associated with<br>
angle=90°/Zj is then shot as in (e) above;<br>
h) Following completion of the sequence at angle=90°, the base plane (n) is made to rotate to angle=180°;<br>
0<br>
i) A sequence of n "instant image photogrammes/frames" associated with angle=180°/Zj is then shot as in (e) above;<br>
j) Following completion of the sequence at angle=180°, the base plane (n) is made to rotate to angle=270°;<br>
k) A sequence of n "instant image photogrammes/frames" associated with angle=270°/Zi is then shot as in (e) above;<br>
1) For the purposes of composing the 360° closed profile of the object obj, let us now consider, for each one of the 4 sequences of n photogrammes/frames of the surveyed digital images (angle=0°, angle=90°, angle=180°, angle=270°), the profile segment equal to 90° calculated on the bisectrix of the angle of incidence as interval -45°/+45° (Fig. 7);<br>
m) The composition of the 4 surveyed, profile segments is obtained by bringing the appropriate profiles back to the plane of angle=0° as follows:<br>
the profile of angle=90° by changing the coordinates from:<br>
x90° to yO°, and y90° to xO°;<br>
the profile of angle=l 80° by changing the coordinates from:<br>
x!80° to xO°, and y!80° to -yO°;<br>
the profile of angle=270° by changing the coordinates from:<br>
x270° to yO°, and y270° to -xO°;<br>
where the coordinates x,y for each system are positioned on the centre of rotation c, evaluated as projection of the incident ray onto the axis of rotation of the base plane n. C.     Data processing modalities:<br>
a)	Each image photogramme/frame, with which there is associated the angle<br>
parameter and the level z, is processed by means of optical filters and/or mathematical<br>
operations with a view to showing only the part of the object obj struck by the activated<br>
LED scanning beam;<br>
b)	The image processes as in (a) above is reduced by means of mathematical<br>
processing to a matrix of numbers corresponding to the image pixels;<br>
c)	The image decomposed in this manner can be associated with the plane<br>
coordinate reference system X,Y of which the points highlighted by the light beam<br>
represent the profile of the object obj projected onto the digital image-shooting plane nl;<br>
d)	The matrix generated in this manner is of the (0,1) type, such that to each<br>
numerical information 1 there corresponds a point of the profile of the object obj, and to<br>
each numerical information 0 there corresponds everything else; the continuous-line that<br>
unites all the points of type 1 corresponds to the profile of the object obj (referred to the<br>
angle and to z), projected onto the digital image-shooting plane nl;<br>
e)	Having obtained the image profile associated with the angle and the level z,<br>
the composition of the 90° segments is carried out as in (1) and (m) of paragraph B in the<br>
image composition phase (Fig. 7);<br>
f)	At  the end of the operation one obtains a set of n  closed profiles<br>
corresponding to the level z\; profile is here understood as a set of m coordinates of the<br>
type (xk, yk, Zj) with k = number of subdivisions of the profile = from 1 to m; each<br>
profile corresponds to a vector of the type m rows, 3 columns [x,y,z];<br>
g)     The composition of all the n vectors associated with the levels z\ eventually generates the space matrix 3D of type and dimension 3D = [m n 3];<br>
h) Since the dimension of the matrix that is being acquired is a function of the resolution of the digital image shooting (example 480x640, 1200x600 pixel), a scaling operation is carried out with a view to re-proportioning the horizontal subdivision (640) and the vertical subdivision (480) of the photograph scale to the real dimensions of the field of view, that is to say, given a known horizontal measure on the base plane, everything is re-proportioned to this value; for example: given the known measure of 10 cm on the base plane n corresponding to an interval equal to 400 pixel, to every pixel there corresponds a reading interval equal to (10 cm)/400 = 0,4 cm = 4 mm; this scaling operation is carried out only once at the end of the computation process by multiplying the matrix 3D by Sf (Sf = scale factor matrix), thus obtaining the matrix of the real coordinates of the object 3Dr = 3D x Sf, still of the type [m n 3] - (module VT-MF "- Mod. A printing);<br>
i) Generation of the colour information: prior to the digital shooting of every sequence of n images for the positions angle=0°, angle=90°, angle=180°, angle-270°, there is obtained a digital shot of the object obj without any position information associated with the activated LED beam; each of the 4 images obtained is defined as a colour sampling image 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°;<br>
j) The map of profile points identified on the plane nl can be associated with the corresponding image points of which the colour information is also known, as in (h) above;<br>
k) The printing system integrated in the reproduction device VT-MF " utilizes the colour information associated with the points on nl, of the type [X,Y,Colour], rectified on the plane n [x,y,Colour].<br>
D.	Operation of rectifying the colour of the object obj:<br>
a)	Association of the coordinates on nl with the image colour 3Dc =<br>
[X,Y,C], where C=number corresponding to the colour, which may be of type:<br>
figure comprised between 0 and 255 (information about 256-colour scale), or by<br>
using the RGB method with 3 numerical-type information items [0-255,0-255,0-<br>
255];<br>
b)	Association of the points translated onto the reference system (x,y,/)<br>
with the corresponding (X,Y,C);<br>
c)	Creation of colour curve: the realization of the cutting profile in the<br>
reproduction systems VT-MF " (Mod. A printing) utilizes the coordinates of the<br>
matrix 3Dr; for the purpose of colouring the aforesaid profiles, the positions of the<br>
points of 3Dr are associated with the positions of the matrix 3Dc in the following<br>
manner: considering the ith profile of 3Dr as a vector of type [x,y,Z|] consisting of<br>
m rows, the information of 3Dc [X,Y,C] with coordinates X,Y is associated with<br>
the positions i of the matrix 3D. With a view to realizing a continuous colour<br>
curve, use is made of broken-lines that unite consecutive points by linearly<br>
interpolating the known points of (X,Y,C) and real points (x,y,Zj).<br>
E.	Formulation  of the  matrices   P,   3D,   3Dr,   3Dc;   the   operation   is<br>
subdivided as follows:<br>
1.	Shooting digital image photogrammes/frames on plane images taken<br>
with the LEDs not activated, for the generation of the colour information: No.4<br>
images corresponding to the positions of the object colour sampling image 0°,<br>
90°, 180°, 270°;<br>
2.	Shooting digital image photogrammes/frames on plane images shot<br>
with the LEDs activated: IjjZj = acquired image associated with the indices i =1:4<br>
, angle=270°), zf = 1: n (scanning levels);<br>
3.     Processing of the images acquired in 1 and 2 above:<br>
a)	Processing  the  images   Ij;Zj  with   a  colour  filter  (optical   filter  or<br>
mathematical filter) that brings out only the image portions struck by the activated<br>
LED beam;<br>
b)	Extraction of the profile matrices PJ,ZJ with indices i =1:4 (images at<br>
angle=0°,   angle=90°,   angle=180°,   angle=270°),  Zj  =   1:   n  (scanning  levels)<br>
containing the profiles, utilizing the pixel position as coordinate system and<br>
associating the numerical information 1 with the profile points and the numerical<br>
information 0 with all the others; this extraction considers the profile segment<br>
corresponding to -45°/+45°, valued with respect to the directrix passing through<br>
the projection point of the level plane on the axis of rotation of the base plane and<br>
the straight line perpendicular to the image plane;<br>
c)	Rototranslation of the information from the digital image plane nl to the<br>
rotating base plane n; the parameters are defined as:<br>
d = horizontal measure of the distance between the centre c of the rotating base plane TI and the projection of the centre cl of the digital image plane Til;<br>
-	v = vertical measure of the distance between the centre c of the rotating base<br>
plane 71 and the projection of the centre cl of the digital image plane Til;<br>
-	a = arctan (v/d);<br>
-	T = vector of the translation coordinates of the Cartesian system from the<br>
image base plane: n = [0 - d v]<br>
R = rotation matrix of the Cartesian system from the image base plane:<br>
R = [l	0	0<br>
0	cos (a- 90°)	cos (a)<br>
0	cos (a-180°)        cos (a-90°)]<br>
-	P = vector of the coordinates identified on digital image plane nl with level<br>
Z associated with LED position = (X,Y,Z);<br>
-	X = coordinate points of profile obtained from image;<br>
-	Y = coordinate points of profile obtained from image;<br>
-	Z - + z * sin (a) - (Y - z * cos (a)) / tan (a) - (d2 + v2)172;<br>
-	z = level of the LED position associated with the image.<br>
F.	Rototranslation of the Cartesian system from the plane TT! to the plane it:<br>
a)	3D = matrix rototranslated from the plane TT! to the base plane n;<br>
b)	3D = [P - T]*R<br>
G.	Generation of the matrix set 3Drr, 3Drrt for the radial coordinates<br>
system:<br>
a) Given the matrices 3Dr and 3Dc, let us consider their re-computation in accordance with a new coordinate system of the radial-type. Having defined 3Dr as a matrix of type [x y z] and the associated matrix 3Dc [x y C], which has a composition of the type [x y z C], we can compute the transformation of the Cartesian coordinates from orthogonal to radial in accordance with the following definition:<br>
Rg = RgO + 8/360*0 = winding radium with respect to the axis of rotation;<br>
-Rg = (x2+y2)1/2;<br>
-	RgO = initial radium of the axis of the spiral winding;<br>
-	0 = (Rg-RgO)*360/S = winding angle [in degrees];<br>
-	S = thickness of the spiral-wound sheet;<br>
b)	We now define the matrix describing the geometry of the object obj in<br>
the radial system as the matrix 3Drr = [Rg 0 z] associated with the corresponding<br>
matrix 3Dc such as compose a space and surface-colour matrix of the type [Rg 6 z<br>
C];<br>
c)	The matrix 3Drr makes it possible to construct the volume of the<br>
object obj on the basis of a spiral-wound axis of rotation having a thickness S; the<br>
templates to be consecutive cut can be obtained, respectively, from the space confine<br>
edges of the matrix set that describes the volume of the object obj (module VT-MF "<br>
- Mod. B printing);<br>
d)	Given the matrix  3Drr,  the  cutting  condition tg  is  obtained  in<br>
accordance with the following logic: given 3Drr = [Rg 9 z] ordered in accordance<br>
with increasing values 0,z, one defines the information:<br>
tg = active =1 (when Zj * z\ + \) tg = inactive = 0 ( when z\ - z\ + \ orr)<br>
Having composed all the information into the vector [tg], one then composes the new matrix 3Drrt:<br>
3Drrt = 3Drr + [tg] = [Rg 6 z tg]<br>
In the rectification plane of the spiral, the cutting information vector [tg] constitutes the external confine of the object obj (module VT-MF "- Mod. B printing).<br>
Modulo VT-MS ":<br>
The digital photo-optical scanner module VT-MS n is the system that makes possible the acquisition of the data necessary for defining the numerical matrices 3Dr and 3Dc of the chromatic and space coordinates of the object obj and is made up of:<br>
1.      Rotating base plane on which there are placed the objects obj to be surveyed;<br><br>
2.	Digital image survey and acquisition system (photo camera or video camera);<br>
3.	System of luminescent LEDs capable of generating a linear light beam<br>
projected parallel to the rotating base plane on which the objects obj to be<br>
surveyed are supported.<br>
The following points set out the definition of the characteristics:<br>
a)	The rotating base plane has a rotation pin at its centre, said pin enabling it to<br>
rotate through angles comprised between 0° and 360°, the movement may be of the<br>
manual rotation type, by mean of adjustment screws or of the motorized type, connected<br>
with the data management board;<br>
b)	The digital image survey and acquisition system is arranged such as to confer<br>
upon the photo camera or video camera employed the macro-type/parallel beam<br>
modality, with a specific angle (a) respect to the base plane (it);<br>
c)	The LED system is situated on the vertical of the digital image acquisition<br>
device, it generates a linear light beam projected parallel to the rotating base plane in<br>
accordance with predetermined distances and movements that are either stepped or of<br>
the  continuous,  motor-controlled  type.  The  positioning  of the  light  beam  is<br>
coordinated with the shooting sequence of the image photogrammes/frames, so that a<br>
particular position of the projected beam is associated with each acquired image; the<br>
LED system is linked to an electronically controlled kinematic mechanism that<br>
makes possible a movement in steps determined in accordance with z of the base<br>
plane n\ when the images are acquired by means of a digital photo camera, the<br>
number of the images in the sequence from 1 to n is associated with the step position<br>
of the scanning light beam, i.e. to image 1 there corresponds a displacement step<br>
led/1, equal to a known measure that corresponds to the projection of the light beam<br>
moved along the extension of the vertical sliding axis of the device, image 2<br><br>
corresponds to step led/2, etc. When the images are acquired by means of a video camera capable of realizing a sequence of nf images per second [images/s] and the LED system is displaced with a continuous-type motion at a speed of Vz [mm/s], the shooting parameters are associated in the following manner: let t be a generic instant of the shooting motion of the digitally acquired photogrammes/frames, measured from   the   beginning   of the   motion   sequence,   as   regards   the   video   camera shooting/movement of the LED scanning plane, we define: N image = image number = t x nf S image = displacement associated with image N image = t x Vz<br>
When the shooting parameters nf and vz are understood in this manner, the level z of the object obj subjected to scanning can be defined by subdividing the total shooting time Tr into n steps, such that t = Tr/n = time interval between two consecutive images, i.e. when n is increased, one increases the definition of the numerical matrix 3D;<br>
d) The hardware integrated in the module envisages the use of the method described in connection with the module VT-Data ", paragraphs (A) to (E).<br>

This reproduction module provides to printing modalities, namely Mod. A printing, operated by means of the logic 3Dr and 3Dc when the supports of the plastic, composite or papery type are available in the form of sheets; and Mod.<br>
B printing, operated by means of the logic 3Drrt and 3Dc when the supports of the plastic, composite or papery type are available in the form of rolls.<br>
Mod. A printing of the module VT-MF " reproduces the external surface of the object obj by processing by means of templating and superposing the plane surfaces (corresponding to the subdivision into parallel layers of the virtual object obj to be reproduced, in accordance with matrix 3Dr) of the chosen and employed supports of the plastic, composite or papery type when they are in the form of sheets (Figure 12).<br>
Mod. B printing of the module VT-MF " reproduces the external surface of the object obj by processing by means of templating and winding around an axis of rotation of the continuous surface (corresponding to the subdivision into consecutive spiral-shaped layers of the virtual object obj to be reproduced, in accordance with matrix 3Drr) of the chosen and employed supports of the plastic, composite or papery type when they are in the form of rolls (Figure 17).<br>
Associated with the cutting device of the reproduction module VT-MF N for processing the employed supports of the sheet-type and/or the roll-type (cut management in accordance with VT-Data n logic of type 3Dr and 3Drrt), is a printing device for the coloured reproduction of the external surface of the object obj with fidelity to detail and reproduction of the digital photographic type (printer management in accordance with VT-Data " logic of type 3Dc).

The sequential cutting operation of the plane profiles (VT-MF n- Mod.

correspond physically to the employed supports of the sheet-type with their specific composition and structure of plastic, composite or papery material.<br>
The continuous cutting operation of the spiral-shaped profiles of the angles of revolution paired (VT-MF "- Mod.

The hardware contained in the system of the module VT-MF u assures the decomposition of the matrix 3Dr into n planes and the decomposition of the matrix SDrrt into n spirals (Maximum value of radius=Rg max=RgO + 8/360*9 max; n= 6 max/360), scaling the resolution and the subdivision of the planes and spirals in accordance with the needs of the user.<br>
The in-the-round construction of the three-dimensional volume of the object obj is realized by means of the composition by specific jointing of the sections into which the initial volume of the object obj was subdivided and recomposed. This combinatorial property makes it possible to manage the reproduction of the dimensional volume of the object obj in a practically unlimited manner, so that there comes into being the possibility of reproducing the outline of any kind of object obj in plastic, composite or papery material and with dimensions that are neither restricted nor restricting by means of the subdivision into modular parts of a scale as required by the volume to be realized, previously processed by VT-Data " as numerical matrices 3Dr, 3Drrt and 3Dc.<br><br>

The shaping of the objects obj as previously described is carried out with the help of cutting system of the low-power-laser type, the cutting head being electronically managed by the hardware of the module VT-MF " based on information obtained by means of the matrices 3Dr and 3Drrt; these modellings also permit the cutting of particular notches (pin spaces) arranged flush with and/or within the plane surface of the worked support (indicated by 26 in Figure 11) of the specific separation insert of the employed support in plastic, composite or papery material (indicated by 22 in Figure 8) for a predefined, subsequently consecutive series of pre-established planes and spirals of the object obj to be reconfigured.<br>

A printing -the position and the number of the pins necessary for joining the decomposed parts of the three-dimensional volume of the objects obj to be reconfigured is a function of the previously defined scale size of the objects <br>
The system is capable of reproducing the coloration of the outline (template) of the supports made of plastic, composite or papery material produced by both cutting systems of VT-MF n (Mod. A printing and Mod B printing), with a reproduction fidelity of the digital photography type; coloration corresponding to the nth profile colour of the volume of the object obj (matrix 3Dc), where the corresponding colour<br><br>
information is associated with each profile point and/or defined by the user by means of information transferred from a CAD 3D design.<br>
