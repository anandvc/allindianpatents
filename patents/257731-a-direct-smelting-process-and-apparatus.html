A DIRECT SMELTING PROCESS AND APPARATUS<br>
The present invention relates to a process and an<br>
apparatus for producing molten metal (which term includes<br>
metal alloys), in particular although by no means<br>
exclusively iron, from ferrous material, such as ores,<br>
partly reduced ores and metal-containing waste streams.<br>
The present invention relates particularly to a<br>
molten metal bath-based direct smelting process and an<br>
apparatus for producing molten metal from a ferrous<br>
material.<br>
One known molten bath-based direct smelting<br>
process for producing molten ferrous metal is the DIOS<br>
process. The DIOS process includes a pre-reduction stage<br>
and a smelt reduction stage. In the DIOS process ore (-<br>
8mm) is pre-heated (750°C) and pre-reduced (10 to 30%) in<br>
fluidised beds using offgas from a smelt reduction vessel<br>
which contains a molten bath of metal and slag, with the<br>
slag forming a deep layer on the metal. The fine (-3mm)<br>
and coarse (-8mm) components of the ore are separated in<br>
the pre-reduction stage of the process. Coal and pre-<br>
heated and pre-reduced ore (via two feed lines) are fed<br>
continuously into the smelt reduction furnace from the top<br>
of the furnace. The ore dissolves and forms FeO in the<br>
deep layer of slag and the coal decomposes into char and<br>
volatile matter in the slag layer. Oxygen is blown through,<br>
a specially designed lance that improves secondary<br>
combustion in the foamed slag. Oxygen jets burn carbon<br>
monoxide that is generated with the smelting reduction<br>
reactions, thereby generating heat that is transferred to<br>
the molten slag. The FeO is reduced at the slag/metal and<br>
slag/char interfaces. Stirring gas introduced into the hot<br>
metal bath from the bottom of the smelt reduction vessel<br>
improves heat transfer efficiency and increases the<br>
slag/metal interface for reduction. Slag and metal are<br><br>
tapped periodically.<br>
Another known direct smelting process for<br>
producing molten ferrous metal is the AISI process. The<br>
AISI process also includes a pre-reduction stage and a<br>
smelt reduction stage. In the AISI process pre-heated and<br>
partially pre-reduced iron ore pellets, coal or coke breeze<br>
and fluxes are top charged into a pressurised smelt reactor<br>
which contains a molten bath of metal and slag. The coal<br>
devolatilises in the slag layer and the iron ore pellets<br>
dissolve in the slag and then are reduced by carbon (char)<br>
in the slag. The process conditions result in slag<br>
foaming. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen generated in the<br>
process are post combusted in or just above the slag layer<br>
to provide the energy required for the endothermic<br>
reduction reactions. Oxygen is top blown through a<br>
central, water cooled lance and nitrogen is injected<br>
through tuyeres at the bottom of the reactor to ensure<br>
sufficient stirring to facilitate heat transfer of the post<br>
combustion energy to the bath. The process offgas is de-<br>
dusted in a hot cyclone before being fed to a shaft type<br>
furnace for pre-heating and pre-reduction of the pellets to<br>
FeO or wustite.<br>
Another known direct smelting process, which<br>
relies on a molten metal layer as a reaction medium, and is<br>
generally referred to as the HIsmelt process, is described<br>
in International application PCT/AU96/00197 (WO 96/31627)<br>
in the name of the applicant.<br>
The HIsmelt process as described in the<br>
International application comprises:<br>
(a)	forming a bath of molten metal and slag in a<br>
vessel;<br>
(b)	injecting into the bath:<br><br>
(i) metalliferous feed material, typically<br>
metal oxides; and<br>
(ii) a solid carbonaceous material,<br>
typically coal, which acts as a<br>
reducfcant of the metal oxides and a<br>
source of energy; and<br>
(c) smelting the metalliferous feed material to<br>
metal in the metal layer.<br>
The HIsmelt process also comprises injecting<br>
oxygen-containing gas into a space above the bath and post-<br>
combusting reaction gases, such as CO and H2, released from<br>
the bath and transferring the heat generated to the bath to.<br>
contribute to the thermal energy required to smelt the<br>
metalliferous feed materials.<br>
The HIsmelt process also comprises forming a<br>
transition zone in the space above the nominal quiescent<br>
surface of the bath in which there is a favourable mass of<br>
ascending and thereafter descending droplets or splashes or<br>
streams of molten materiel which provide an effective<br>
medium to transfer to the bath the thermal energy generated<br>
by post-combusting reaction gases above the bath.<br>
The HIsmelt process as described in the<br>
International application is characterised by forming the<br>
transition zone by injecting a carrier gas, metalliferous<br>
feed material, and solid carbonaceous material into the<br>
bath through a section of the side of the vessel that is in<br>
contact with the bath and/or from above the bath so that<br>
the carrier gas and the solid material penetrate the bath<br>
and cause molten material to be projected into the space<br>
above the surface of the bath.<br><br>
The HIsmelt process as described in the<br>
International application is an improvement over earlier<br>
forms of the HIsmelt process which form the transition zone<br>
by bottom injection of gas and/or carbonaceous material<br>
into the bath which causes droplets and splashes and<br>
streams of molten material to be projected from the bath.<br>
The applicant has carried out extensive research<br>
and pilot plant work on direct smelting processes and has<br>
made a series of significant findings in relation to such<br>
processes.	<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a direct<br>
smelting process for producing metals (which term<br>
includes metal alloys) from a ferrous material said<br>
process comprises the steps of : (a) forming a bath of<br>
molten metal and molten slag in a metallurgical vessel ;<br>
(b) injecting feed materials being solid material and<br>
carrier gas into the molten bath at a velocity of at<br>
least 40m/s through a downwardly extending solids<br>
injection lance having a delivery tube of internal<br>
diameter of 40 - 200 mm that is located so that a central<br>
axis of an outlet end of the lance is at an angle of 20<br>
to 90 degrees to a horizontal axis and generating a<br>
superficial gas flow of at least 0.04 nm3/s/m2 within the<br>
molten bath (where m2 relates to the area of a horizontal<br>
cross-section through the molten bath) at least in part<br>
by reactions of injected material in the bath which<br>
causes molten material to be projected upwardly as<br>
splashes, droplets and streams and form an expanded<br>
molten bath zone, the gas flow and the upwardly projected<br>
molten material causing substantial movement of material<br>
within the molten bath and strong mixing of the molten<br>
bath, the feed materials being selected so that, in an<br>
overall sense, the reactions of the feed materials in the<br>
molten bath are and strong mixing of the molten bath, the<br>
feed materials being selected so that, in an overall<br><br>
sense, the reactions of the feed materials in the molten<br>
bath are endothermic; and (c) injecting an oxygen-<br>
containing gas into an upper region of the vessel via at<br>
least one oxygen gas injection lance and post-combusting<br>
combustible gases released from the molten bath, whereby<br>
ascending and thereafter descending molten material in<br>
the expanded molten bath zone facilitate heat transfer to<br>
the molten bath.<br>
The expanded molten bath zone is characterised by<br>
a high volume fraction of gas voidages throughout the<br>
molten material.<br>
Preferably the volume fraction of gas voidages is<br>
at least 30% by volume of the expanded molten bath zone.<br>
The splashes, droplets and streams of molten<br>
material are generated by the above-described flow of gas<br>
within the molten bath. Whilst the applicant does not wish<br>
to be bound by the following comments, the applicant<br>
believes that the splashes, droplets and streams are<br>
generated by a churn-turbulent regime at lower gas flow<br>
rates and by a fountain regime at higher gas flow rates.<br>
Preferably the gas flow and the upwardly<br>
projected molten material cause substantial movement of<br>
material into and from the molten bath.<br><br><br>
Preferably the solid material includes ferrous<br>
material and/or solid carbonaceous material.<br>
The above-described expanded molten bath zone is<br>
quite different to the layer of foaming slag produced in<br>
the above-described AISI process.<br>
Preferably step (b) includes injecting feed<br>
materials into the molten bath so that the feed materials<br>
penetrate a lower region of the molten bath.<br>
Preferably the expanded molten bath zone forms on<br>
the lower region of the molten bath.<br>
Preferably step (b) includes injecting feed<br>
materials into the molten bath via the lance at a velocity<br>
in the range of 80-100 m/s.<br>
Preferably step (b) includes injecting feed<br>
materials into the molten bath via the lance at a mass flow-<br>
rate of up to 2.0 t/m2/s where m2 relates to the cross-<br>
sectional area of the lance delivery tube.<br>
Preferably step (b) includes injecting feed<br>
materials into the molten bath via the lance at a<br>
solids/gas ratio of 10-25 kg solids/Nm3 gas.<br>
More preferably the solid gas ratio is 10-18 kg<br>
solids/Nm3 gas.<br>
Preferably the gas flow within the molten bath<br>
generated in step (b) is at least 0.04Nm3/s/m2 at the<br>
quiescent surface of the molten bath.<br>
More preferably the gas flow within the molten<br>
bath is at a flow rate of at least 0.2 Nm3/s/m2.<br><br>
More preferably the gas flow rate is at least 0.3<br>
Nm3/s/m2.<br>
Preferably the gas flow rate is less than 2<br>
Nm3/s/m2.<br>
The gas flow within the molten bath may be<br>
generated in part as a result of bottom and/or side wall<br>
injection of a gas into the molten bath, preferably the<br>
lower region of the molten bath.<br>
Preferably the oxygen-containing gas is air or<br>
oxygen-enriched air.<br>
Preferably the process includes injecting air or<br>
oxygen-enriched air into the vessel at a temperature of<br>
800-1400°C and at a velocity of 200-600 m/s via at least<br>
one oxygen gas injection lance and forcing the expanded<br>
molten bath zone in the region of the lower end of the<br>
lance away from the lance and forming a "free" space around<br>
the lower end of the lance that has a concentration of<br>
molten material that is lower than the molten material<br>
concentration in the expanded molten bath zone; the lance<br>
being located so that; (i) a central axis of the lance is<br>
at an angle of 20 to 90° relative to a horizontal axis;<br>
(ii) the lance extends into the vessel a distance that is<br>
at least the outer diameter of the lower end of the lance;<br>
and (iii) the lower end of the lance is at least 3 times<br>
the outer diameter of the lower end of the lance above the<br>
quiescent surface of the molten bath.<br>
Preferably the concentration of molten material<br>
in the free space around the lower end of the lance is 5%<br>
or less by volume of the space.<br>
Preferably the free space around the lower end of<br>
the lance is a semi-spherical volume that has a diameter<br><br>
that is at least 2 times the outer diameter of the lower<br>
end of the lance.<br>
Preferably the free space around the lower end of<br>
the lance is no more than 4 times the outer diameter of the<br>
lower end of the lance.<br>
Preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least<br>
60%, by volume of the oxygen in the air or oxygen enriched<br>
air is combusted in the free space around the lower end of<br>
the lance.<br>
Preferably the process includes injecting air or<br>
oxygen-enriched air into the vessel in a swirling motion.<br>
The term "smelting" is understood herein to mean<br>
thermal processing wherein chemical reactions that reduce<br>
the ferrous feed material take place to produce liquid<br>
metal.<br>
The term "quiescent surface" in the context of<br>
the molten bath is understood to mean the surface of the<br>
molten bath under process conditions in which there is no<br>
gas/solids injection and therefore no bath agitation.<br>
Preferably the process includes maintaining a<br>
high slag inventory in the vessel relative to the molten<br>
ferrous metal in the vessel.<br>
The amount of slag in the vessel, ie the slag<br>
inventory, has a direct impact on the amount of slag that<br>
is in the expanded molten bath zone.<br>
The relatively low heat transfer characteristics<br>
of slag compared to metal is important in the context of<br>
minimising heat loss from the expanded molten bath zone to<br>
the water cooled side walls and from the vessel via the<br><br>
.. The amount of slag in the vessel, ie the slag<br>
inventory, may be controlled by the tapping rates of metal<br>
and slag.<br>
The production of slag in the vessel may be<br>
controlled by varying the feed rates of metalliferous feed<br>
material, carbonaceous material, and fluxes to the vessel<br>
and operating parameters such as oxygen-containing gas<br>
injection rates.<br>
Preferably the process includes controlling the<br>
level of dissolved carbon in molten iron to be at least 3<br>
wt% and maintaining the slag in a strongly reducing<br>
condition leading to FeO levels of less than 6 wt%, more<br>
preferably less than 5 wt%, in the slag.<br>
Preferably ferrous material is smelted to metal<br>
at least predominantly in the lower region of the molten<br>
bath. Invariably, this region of the vessel is where there<br>
will be a high concentration of metal.<br>
In practice, there will be a proportion of the<br>
ferrous material that is smelted to metal in other regions<br>
of the vessel. However, the objective of the process of<br>
the present invention, and an important difference between<br>
the process and prior art processes, is to maximise<br>
smelting of ferrous material in the lower region of the<br>
molten bath.<br>
Step (b) of the process may include injecting<br>
feed materials through a plurality of solids injection<br>
lances and generating the gas flow of at least 0/04<br>
Nm3/s/m2 within the molten bath.<br>
The injection of ferrous material and<br>
carbonaceous material may be through the same or separate<br><br>
side walls of the vessel.<br>
By appropriate process control, slag in the<br>
expanded molten bath zone can form a layer or layers on the<br>
side walls that adds resistance to heat loss from the side<br>
walls.<br>
Therefore, by changing the slag inventory it is<br>
possible to increase or decrease the amount of slag in the<br>
expanded molten bath zone and on the side walls and<br>
therefore control the heat loss via the side walls of the<br>
vessel.<br>
The slag may form a "wet" layer or a "dry" layer<br>
on the side walls. A "wet" layer comprises a frozen layer<br>
that adheres to the side walls, a semi-sol id (mush) layer,<br>
and an outer liquid film. A "dry" layer is one in which<br>
substantially all of the slag is frozen.<br>
The amount of slag in the vessel also provides a<br>
measure of control over the extent of post combustion.<br>
Specifically, if the slag inventory is too low<br>
there will be increased exposure of metal in the expanded<br>
molten bath zone and therefore increased oxidation of metal<br>
and dissolved carbon in metal and the potential for reduced'<br>
post-combustion and consequential decreased post<br>
combustion, notwithstanding the positive effect that metal<br>
in the expanded molten bath zone has on heat transfer to<br>
the metal layer.<br>
In addition, if the slag inventory is too high<br>
the one or more than one oxygen-containing gas injection<br>
lance/tuyere will be buried in the expanded molten bath<br>
zone and this minimises movement of top space reaction<br>
gases to the end of the or each lance/tuyere and, as a<br>
consequence, reduces potential for post-combustion.<br><br>
lances.<br>
Preferably the process includes causing molten<br>
material to be projected above the expanded molten bath<br>
zone.<br>
Preferably the level of post-combust ion is at<br>
least 40%/ where post-combustion is defined as:<br>
	[C02] + [H20]	<br>
[C02] + [H20] + [CO] + [H2]<br>
where;<br>
[C02] = volume % of C02 in off-gas<br>
o<br>
[HaO] = volume % of HaO in off-gas<br>
[CO] = volume % of CO in off-gas<br>
[H2] = volume % of H2 in off-gas<br>
The expanded molten bath zone is important for 2<br>
reasons. ,<br>
Firstly, the ascending and thereafter descending<br>
molten material is an effective means of transferring to<br>
the molten bath the heat generated by post-combustion of<br>
reaction gases.<br>
Secondly, the molten material, and particularly<br>
the slag, in the expanded molten bath zone is an effective<br>
means of minimising heat loss via the side walls of the<br>
vessel.<br>
Ra important difference between the preferred<br>
embodiment of the process of the present invention and<br>
prior art processes is that in the preferred embodiment the<br>
main smelting region is the lower region of the molten bath<br>
and the main oxidation (ie heat generation) region is above<br><br>
and in an upper region of the expanded molten bath zone and<br>
these regions are spatially well separated and heat<br>
transfer is via physical movement of molten metal and slag<br>
between the two regions.<br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus for<br>
producing metal from a ferrous material by a direct<br>
smelting process, which apparatus apparatus comprises a<br>
fixed non-tiltable vessel that contains a molten bath of<br>
metal and slag and includes a lower region and an<br>
expanded molten bath zone above the lower region, the<br>
expanded molten bath zone being formed by gas flow from<br>
the lower region which carries molten material upwardly<br>
from the lower region, said vessel comprises : a) a<br>
health formed of refractory material having a base and<br>
sides in contact with the lower region of the molten<br>
bath; b) side walls extending upwardly from the sides of<br>
the hearth and being in contact with an upper region of<br>
the molten bath and the gas continuous space, wherein the<br>
side walls that contact the gas continuous space include<br>
water cooled panels and a layer of slag on the panels; c)<br>
at least one lance extending downwardly into the vessel<br>
and injecting oxygen-containing gas into the vessel above<br>
the molten bath; d) at least one lance injecting feed<br>
materials being ferrous material and/ or carbonaceous<br>
material and carrier gas into the molten bath at a<br>
velocity of at least 40 m/s, the lance being located so<br>
that a central axis of an outlet end of the lance is<br>
angled downwardly at an angle of 20 to 90° to a<br>
horizontal axis, the lance having a delivery tube for<br>
injecting feed materials which has an internal diameter<br>
of 40 - 200 mm; and e) a means for tapping molten metal<br>
and slag from the vessel.<br><br>
Preferably the feed material injection lance is<br>
located so that the outlet end of the lance is 150-1500mm<br>
above the nominal quiescent surface of a metal layer of the<br>
molten bath.<br>
Preferably the feed materials injection lance<br>
includes a central core tube through which to pass the '<br>
solid particulate material; an annular cooling jacket<br>
surrounding the central core tube throughout a substantial<br>
part of its length, which jacket defines an inner elongate<br>
annular water flow passage disposed about the core tube, an<br>
outer elongate annular water flow passage disposed about<br>
the inner water flow passage, and an annular end passage<br>
interconnecting the inner and outer water flow passages at<br>
a forward end of the cooling jacket; water inlet means for<br>
inlet of water into the inner annular water flow passage of<br>
the jacket at a rear end region of the jacket; an water<br>
outlet means for outlet of water from the outer annular<br>
water flow passage at the rear end region of the jacket,<br>
whereby to provide for flow of cooling water forwardly<br>
along the inner elongate annular - passage to the forward end<br>
of the jacket then through the end flow passage means and<br>
backwardly through the outer elongate annular water flow<br>
passage, wherein the annular end passage curves smoothly<br>
outwardly and backwardly from the inner elongate annular<br>
passage to the outer elongate annular passage and the<br>
effective cross-sectional area for water flow through the<br>
end passage is less than the cross-sectional flow areas of<br>
both the inner and outer elongate annular water flow<br><br>
passages.<br>

lower barrel section formed from water cooled panels (not<br>
shown) having an inner lining of refractory bricks; a roof<br>
17; an outlet 18 for off-gases; a forehearth 19 for<br>
discharging molten metal continuously; and a tap-hole 21<br>
for discharging molten slag.<br>
In use, under quiescent conditions, the vessel<br>
contains a molten bath of iron and slag which includes a<br>
layer 22 of molten metal and a layer 23 of molten slag on<br>
the metal layer 22.<br>
The term "metal layer" is understood herein to<br>
mean that region of the bath that is predominantly metal.<br>
The space above the nominal quiescent surface of<br>
the molten bath is hereinafter referred to as the "top<br>
space".<br>
The arrow marked by the numeral 24 indicates the<br>
position of the nominal quiescent surface of the metal<br>
layer 22 and the arrow marked by the numeral 25 indicates<br>
the position of the nominal quiescent surface of the slag<br>
layer 23 (ie of the molten bath).<br>
The term "quiescent surface" is understood to<br>
mean the surface when there is no injection of gas and<br>
solids into the vessel.<br>
The vessel is fitted with a downwardly extending<br>
hot air injection lance 26 for delivering a hot air blast<br>
into an upper region of the vessel and post-combusting<br>
reaction gases released from the molten bath. The lance 26<br>
has an outer diameter D at a lower end of the lance. The<br>
lance 26 is located so that:<br>
(i) a central axis of the lance 26 is at an<br>
angle of 20 to 90° relative to a<br><br>
horizontal axis (the lance 26 shown in<br>
Figure 1 is at an angle of 90°);<br>
(ii) the lance 26 extends into the vessel a<br>
distance that is at least the outer<br>
diameter D of the lower end of the lance;<br>
and<br>
(iii) the lower end of the lance 26 is at least<br>
3 times the outer diameter D of the lower<br>
end of the lance above the quiescent<br>
surface 25 of the molten bath.<br>
The vessel is also fitted with solids injection<br>
lances 27 (two shown) extending downwardly and inwardly<br>
through the side walls 14 and into the molten bath with<br>
outlet ends 82 of the lances 27 at an angle of 20-70° to<br>
the horizontal for injecting iron ore, solid carbonaceous<br>
material, and fluxes entrained in an oxygen-deficient<br>
carrier gas into the molten bath. The position of the<br>
lances 27 is selected so that their outlet ends 82 are<br>
above the quiescent surface 24 of the metal layer 22. This<br>
position of the lances 27 reduces the risk of damage<br>
through contact with molten metal and also makes it<br>
possible to cool the lances 27 by forced internal water<br>
cooling without significant risk of water coming into<br>
contact with the molten metal in the vessel. Specif icallyy<br>
the position of the lances 27 is selected so that the<br>
outlet ends 82 are in the range of 150-1500mm above the<br>
quiescent surface 24 of the metal layer 22. In this<br>
connection, it is noted that, whilst the lances 27 are<br>
shown in Figure 1 as extending into the vessel, the outlet<br>
ends of the lances 27 may be flush with the side wall 14.<br>
The lances 27 are described in more detail with reference<br>
to Figures 2-5.<br>
In use, iron ore, solid carbonaceous material<br><br>
(typically coal), and fluxes (typically lime and magnesia)<br>
entrained in a carrier gas (typically N2) are injected into<br>
the molten bath via the lances 27 at a velocity of at least<br>
40 m/s, preferably 80-100 m/s. The momentum of the solid<br>
material/carrier gas causes the solid material and gas to<br>
penetrate to a lower region of the molten bath. The coal<br>
is devolatilised and thereby produces gas in the lower bath<br>
region. Carbon partially dissolves into the metal and<br>
partially remains as solid carbon. The iron ore is smelted<br>
to metal and the smelting reaction generates carbon<br>
monoxide gas. The gases transported into the lower bath<br>
region and generated via devolatilisation and smelting<br>
produce significant buoyancy uplift of molten metal, solid<br>
carbon, and slag (drawn into the lower bath region as a<br>
conse
region which generates an upward movement of splashes,<br>
droplets and streams of molten metal and slag, and these<br>
splashes, and droplets, and streams entrain slag as they<br>
move through an upper region of the molten bath. The gas<br>
flow generated by the above-described injection of carrier<br>
gas and bath reactions is at least 0.04Nm3/s/m2 of the<br>
quiescent surface of the molten bath (ie the surface 25) .<br>
The buoyancy uplift of molten metal, solid carbon<br>
and slag causes substantial agitation in the molten bath,<br>
with the result that the molten bath expands in volume and<br>
forms an expanded molten bath zone 28 that has a surface<br>
indicated by the arrow 30. The extent of agitation is such<br>
that there is substantial movement of molten material<br>
within the molten bath (including movement of molten<br>
material into and from the lower bath region) and strong<br>
mixing of the molten bath to the extent that there is<br>
reasonably uniform temperature throughout the molten bath -<br>
typically, 1450 - 1550°C with a temperature variation of<br>
the order of 3 0° in each region.<br>
In addition, the upward gas flow projects some<br><br>
molten material (predominantly slag) beyond the expanded<br>
molten bath zone 28 and onto the part of the upper barrel<br>
section of the side walls 14 that is above the expanded<br>
molten bath zone 28 and onto the roof 17.<br>
In general terms, the expanded molten bath zone<br>
28 is a liquid continuous volume, with gas bubbles therein..<br>
In addition to the above, in use, hot air at a<br>
temperature of 800-1400°C is discharged at a velocity of<br>
200-600 m/s via lance 26 and penetrates the central region<br>
of the expanded molten bath zone 28 and causes an<br>
essentially metal/slag free space 29 to form around the end<br>
of the lance 26.<br>
The hot air blast via the lance 26 post-combusts<br>
reaction gases CO and H2 in the expanded molten bath zone<br>
28 and in the free space 29 around the end of the lance 26<br>
and generates high temperatures of the order of 2000°C or<br>
higher in the gas space. The heat is transferred to the<br>
ascending and descending splashes droplets, and streams, of<br>
molten material in the region of gas injection and the heat<br>
is then partially transferred throughout the molten bath.<br>
The free space 29 is important to achieving high<br>
levels of post combustion because it enables entrainment of<br>
gases in the space above the expanded molten bath zone 28<br>
into the end region of the lance 26 and thereby increases<br>
exposure of available reaction gases to post combustion.<br>
The combined effect of the position of the lance<br>
26, gas flow rate through the lance 26, and upward movement<br>
of splashes, droplets and streams of molten material is to<br>
shape the expanded molten bath zone 28 around the lower<br>
region of the lance 26. This shaped region provides a<br>
partial barrier to heat transfer by radiation to the side<br>
walls 14.<br><br>
Moreover, the ascending and descending droplets,<br>
splashes and streams of molten material is an effective<br>
means of transferring heat from the expanded molten bath<br>
zone 28 to the molten bath with the result that the<br>
temperature of the zone 28 in the region of the side walls<br>
14 is of the order of 1450°C-1550°C.<br>
The construction of the solids injection lances<br>
is illustrated in Figures 2 to 5.<br>
As shown in these figures, each lance 27<br>
comprises a central core tube 31 through which to deliver<br>
the solids material and an annular cooling jacket 32<br>
surrounding the central core tube 31 throughout a<br>
substantial part of its length. Central core tube 31 is<br>
formed of carbon/alloy steel tubing 33 throughout most of<br>
its length, but a stainless steel section 34 at its forward<br>
end projects as a nozzle from the forward end of cooling<br>
jacket 32. The forward end part 34 of core tube 31 is<br>
connected to the carbon/alloy steel section 33 of the core<br>
tube through a short steel adaptor section 35 which is<br>
welded to the stainless steel section 34 and connected to<br>
the carbon/alloy steel section through a screw thread 36.<br>
Central core tube 31 is internally lined through<br>
to the forward end part 34 with a thin ceramic lining 37<br>
formed by a series of cast ceramic tubes. The rear end of<br>
the central core tube 31 is connected through a coupling 38<br>
to a T-piece 39 through which particulate solids material<br>
is delivered in a pressurised fluidising gas carrier, for<br>
example nitrogen.<br>
Annular cooling jacket 32 comprises a long hollow<br>
annular structure 41 comprised of outer and inner tubes 42,<br>
43 interconnected by a front end connector piece 44 and an<br>
elongate tubular structure 45 which is disposed within the<br><br>
hollow annular structure 41 so as to divide the interior of<br>
structure 41 into an inner elongate annular water flow<br>
passage 46 and an outer elongate annular water flow passage<br>
47. Elongate tubular structure 45 is formed by a long<br>
carbon steel tube 48 welded to a machined carbon steel<br>
forward end piece 49 which fits within the front end<br>
connector 44 of the hollow tubular structure 41 to form an<br>
annular end flow passage 51 which interconnects the forward<br>
ends of the inner and outer water flow passages 46, 47.<br>
The rear end of annular cooling jacket 32 is<br>
provided with a water inlet 52 through which the flow of<br>
cooling water can be directed into the inner annular water<br>
flow passage 46 and a water outlet 53 from which water is<br>
extracted from the outer annular passage 47 at the rear end<br>
of the lance. Accordingly, in use of the lance cooling<br>
water flows forwardly down the lance through the inner<br>
annular water flow passage 46 then outwardly and back<br>
around the forward annular end passage 51 into the outer<br>
annular passage 47 through which it flows backwardly along<br>
the lance and out through the outlet 53. This ensures that<br>
the coolest water is in heat transfer relationship with the<br>
incoming solids material to ensure that this material does<br>
not melt or burn before it discharges from the forward end<br>
of the lance and enables effective cooling of both the<br>
solids material being injected through the central core of<br>
the lance as well as effective cooling of the forward end<br>
and outer surfaces of the lance.<br>
The outer surfaces of the tube 42 and front end<br>
piece 44 of the hollow annular structure 41 are machined<br>
with a regular pattern of rectangular projecting bosses 54<br>
each having an undercut or dove tail cross-section so that<br>
the bosses are of outwardly diverging formation and serve<br>
as keying formations for solidification of slag on the<br>
outer surfaces of the lance. Solidification of slag on to<br>
the lance assists in minimising the temperatures in the<br><br>
A DIRECT SMELTING PROCESS AND APPARATUS<br>
The present invention relates to a process and an<br>
apparatus for producing molten metal (which term includes<br>
metal alloys), in particular although by no means<br>
exclusively iron, from ferrous material, such as ores,<br>
partly reduced ores and metal-containing waste streams.<br>
The present invention relates particularly to a<br>
molten metal bath-based direct smelting process and an<br>
apparatus for producing molten metal from a ferrous<br>
material.<br>
One known molten bath-based direct smelting<br>
process for producing molten ferrous metal is the DIOS<br>
process. The DIOS process includes a pre-reduction stage<br>
and a smelt reduction stage. In the DIOS process ore (-<br>
8mm) is pre-heated (750°C) and pre-reduced (10 to 30%) in<br>
fluidised beds using offgas from a smelt reduction vessel<br>
which contains a molten bath of metal and slag, with the<br>
slag forming a deep layer on the metal. The fine (-3mm)<br>
and coarse (-8mm) components of the ore are separated in<br>
the pre-reduction stage of the process. Coal and pre-<br>
heated and pre-reduced ore (via two feed lines) are fed<br>
continuously into the smelt reduction furnace from the top<br>
of the furnace. The ore dissolves and forms FeO in the<br>
deep layer of slag and the coal decomposes into char and<br>
volatile matter in the slag layer. Oxygen is blown through,<br>
a specially designed lance that improves secondary<br>
combustion in the foamed slag. Oxygen jets burn carbon<br>
monoxide that is generated with the smelting reduction<br>
reactions, thereby generating heat that is transferred to<br>
the molten slag. The FeO is reduced at the slag/metal and<br>
slag/char interfaces. Stirring gas introduced into the hot<br>
metal bath from the bottom of the smelt reduction vessel<br>
improves heat transfer efficiency and increases the<br>
slag/metal interface for reduction. Slag and metal are<br><br>
metal components of the lance. It has been found in use<br>
that slag freezing on the forward or tip end of the lance<br>
serves as a base for formation of an extended pipe of solid<br>
material serving as an extension of the lance which further<br>
protects exposure of the metal components of the lance to<br>
the severe operating conditions within the vessel.<br>
It has been found that it is very important to<br>
cooling of the tip end of the lance to maintain a high<br>
water flow velocity around the annular end flow passage 51.<br>
In particular it is most desirable to maintain a water flow<br>
velocity in this region of the order of 10 meters per<br>
second to obtain maximum heat transfer. In order to<br>
maximise the water flow rate in this region, the effective<br>
cross-section for water flow through passage 51 is<br>
significantly reduced below the effective cross-section of<br>
both the inner annular water flow passage 46 and the outer<br>
water flow passage 47. Forward end piece 49 of the inner<br>
tubular structure 45 is shaped and positioned so that water<br>
flowing from the forward end of inner annular passage 46<br>
passes through an inwardly reducing or tapered nozzle flow<br>
passage section 61 to minimise eddies and losses before<br>
passing into the end flow passage 51. The end flow passage<br>
51 also reduces in effective flow area in the direction of<br>
water flow so as to maintain the increased water flow<br>
velocity around the bend in the passage and back to the<br>
outer annular water flow passage 47. In this manner, it is<br>
possible to achieve the necessary high water flow rates in<br>
the tip region of the cooling jacket without excessive<br>
pressure drops and the risk of blockages in other parts of<br>
the lance.<br>
In order to maintain the appropriate cooling<br>
water velocity around the tip end passage 51 and to<br>
minimise heat transfer fluctuations, it is critically<br>
important to maintain a constant controlled spacing between.<br>
the front end piece 49 tubular structure 45 and the end<br><br>
piece 44 of the hollow annular structure 41. This presents<br>
a problem due to differential thermal expansion and<br>
contraction in the components of the lance. In particular,<br>
the outer tube part 42 of hollow annular structure 41 is<br>
exposed to much higher temperatures than the inner tube<br>
part 43 of that structure and the forward end of that<br>
structure therefore tends to roll forwardly in the manner<br>
indicated by the dotted line 62 in Figure 4. This produces<br>
a tendency for the gap between components 44, 49 defining<br>
the passage 51 to open when the lance is exposed to the<br>
operating conditions within the smelting vessel.<br>
Conversely, the passage can tend to close if there is a<br>
drop in temperature during operation. in order to overcome<br>
this problem the rear end of the inner tube 43 of hollow<br>
annular structure 41 is supported in a sliding mounting 63<br>
so that it can move axially relative to the outer tube 42<br>
of that structure, the rear end of inner tubular structure<br>
45 is also mounted in a sliding mounting 64 and is<br>
connected to the inner tube 43 of structure 41 by a series<br>
of circumferentially spaced connector cleats 65 so that the<br>
tubes 43 and 45 can move axially together. In addition,<br>
the end pieces 44, 49 of the hollow annular structure 41<br>
and tubular structure 45 are positively interconnected by a<br>
series of circumf erentially spaced dowels 70 to maintain<br>
the appropriate spacing under both thermal expansion and<br>
contraction movements of the lance jacket.<br>
The sliding mounting 64 for the inner end of<br>
tubular structure 45 is provided by a ring 66 attached to a<br>
water flow manifold structure 68 which defines the water<br>
inlet 52 and outlet 53 and is sealed by an 0-ring seal 69.<br>
The sliding mounting 63 for the rear end of the inner tube<br>
43 of structure 41 is similarly provided by a ring flange<br>
71 fastened to the water manifold structure 68 and is<br>
sealed by an O-ring seal 72. An annular piston 73 is<br>
located within ring flange 71 and connected by a screw<br>
thread connection 80 to the back end of the inner tube 43<br><br>
of structure 41 so as to close a water inlet manifold<br>
chamber 74 which receives the incoming flow of cooling from<br>
inlet 52. Piston 73 slides within hardened surfaces on<br>
ring flange 71 and is fitted with O-rings 81, 82. The<br>
sliding seal provided by piston 73 not only allows<br>
movements of the inner tube 43 due to differential thermal<br>
expansion of structure 41 but it also allows movement of<br>
tube 43 to accommodate any movement of structure 41<br>
generated by excessive water pressure in the cooling<br>
jacket. If for any reason the pressure of the cooling<br>
water flow becomes excessive, the outer tube of structure<br>
41 will be forced outwardly and piston 73 allows the inner<br>
tube to move accordingly to relieve the pressure build up.<br>
An interior space 75 between the piston 73 and the ring<br>
flange 71 is vented through a vent hole 7 6 to allow<br>
movement of the piston and escape of water leaking past the<br>
piston.<br>
The rear part of annular cooling jacket 32 is<br>
provided with an outer stiffening pipe 83 part way down the<br>
lance and defining an annular cooling water passage 84<br>
through which a separate flow of cooling water is passed<br>
via a water inlet 85 and water outlet 86.<br>
Typically cooling water will be passed through<br>
the cooling jacket at a flow rate of lOOmVhr at a maximum<br>
operating pressure of 800kPa to produce water flow<br>
velocities of 10 meters/minute in the tip region of the<br>
jacket. The inner and outer parts of the cooling jacket<br>
can be subjected to temperature differentials of the order<br>
of 200°C and the movement of tubes 42 and 45 within the<br>
sliding mountings 63, 64 can be considerable during<br>
operation of the lance, but the effective cross-sectional<br>
flow area of the end passage 51 is maintained substantially<br>
constant throughout all operating conditions.<br>
It is to be understood that this invention is in<br><br>
no way limited to the details of the illustrated<br>
construction and that many modifications and variations<br>
will fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
In that regard it is noted that the oxygen gas<br>
injection lance can be integral with and form part of the<br>
upper body of a solids injections lance.<br><br>

quiescent surface of a metal layer of the molten bath.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
A DIRECT SMELTING PROCESS AND APPARATUS<br>
A molten-bath based direct smelting process and apparatus is disclosed.<br>
The process comprises injecting feed materials into a molten bath at a velocity of<br>
at least 40m/s through at least one solids injection lance (27) having a delivery<br>
tube of internal diameter of 40-200mm that is located so that a central axis of an<br>
outlet end of the lance is at an angle of 20 to 90 degrees to a horizontal axis.<br>
The feed materials injection generates a superficial gas flow of at least 0.04<br>
Nm3/s/m2 within the molten bath. The gas flow causes molten material to be<br>
projected upwardly as splashes, droplets and streams and form an expanded<br>
molten bath zone, with the gas flow and the upwardly projected molten material<br>
causing strong mixing of the molten bath. The process also comprises injecting<br>
an oxygen-containing gas into an upper region of the vessel to post-combust<br>
gases released from the molten bath.</td>
