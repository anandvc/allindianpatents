				<td>METHODS FOR PRODUCING PROGRESSIVE ADDITION LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular,<br>
the invention provides progressive addition lenses in which unwanted legs<br>
astigmatism is reduced without functional compromise of the distance and channel<br>
widths through the intermediate and near vision zones, as compared to conventional<br>
progressive addition lenses.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
For example, multifocal lenses, such as progressive addition lenses ("PAL"s"), are<br>
used for the treatment of presbyopia. The surface of a PAL provides far,<br>
intermediate, and near vision in a gradual, continuous progression of vertically<br>
increasing dioptric power from far to near focus, or top to bottom of the lens.<br>
PAL"s are appealing to the wearer because PAL"s are free of the visible<br>
ledges between the zones of differing dioptric power that are found in other<br>
multifocal lenses, such as bifocals and trifocals. However, an inherent disadvantage<br>
in PAL"s is unwanted lens astigmatism, or astigmatism introduced or caused by one<br>
or more of the lens" surfaces. Generally, the unwanted lens astigmatism is located<br>
on either side of the near vision zone of the lens and, at or near its approximate<br>
center, reaches a maximum level that corresponds approximately to the near vision<br>
dioptric add power of the lens.<br>
Generally, a PAL with a 2.00 diopter add power and 15 mm channel length<br>
will have about a 2.00 diopter maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism. The<br>
channel width of the lens will be approximately 6 mm in which the unwanted<br>
astigmatism is less than or equal to a 0.75 diopter threshold value.<br>
Any number of lens designs have been tried in attempting to either or both<br>
reduce unwanted astigmatism or increase the minimum channel width. However,<br>
current state-of-the-art progressive addition lenses provide only minimal decreases<br>
in unwanted astigmatism while having large areas in the lenses" peripheries that are<br>
unusable due to unwanted astigmatism. Thus, a need exists for a PAL that reduces<br>
maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism and, at the same time, provides an<br>
increase in the minimum channel width.<br>

Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides progressive addition lenses, as well as<br>
methods for their design and production, in which the maximum, localized unwanted<br>
astigmatism that is associated with a given dioptric add power is reduced compared<br>
to prior art lenses. Additionally, the distance width, or width about the optical center<br>
of the lens that is free of about 0.50 diopters or more of unwanted astigmatism, and<br>
minimum channel width of the lens is suitable for use by the lens wearer.<br>
For purposes of the invention, by "channel" is meant the corridor of vision<br>
that is free of astigmatism of about 0.75 diopters or greater when the wearer"s eye is<br>
scanning from the distance zone to the near zone and back. By "lens" or "lenses" is<br>
meant any ophthalmic lens including, without limitation, spectacle lenses, contact<br>
lenses, intraocular lenses and the like. Preferably, the lens of the invention is a<br>
spectacle lens.<br>
It is one discovery of the invention that maximum, localized astigmatism<br>
may be reduced by combining two or more progressive addition surfaces each<br>
providing a dioptric add power that combines with that of the other surface or<br>
surfaces to produce a lens of a higher dioptric add power than that of the surfaces<br>
individually. By "dioptric add power" is meant the amount of dioptric power<br>
difference between the near and far vision zones of a progressive addition surface.<br>
The lens of the invention exhibits less maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism<br>
and a wider channel than would be expected by producing a lens with the same<br>
dioptric add power using only a single progressive addition surface. Further, it is a<br>
discovery of the invention that the use of more than one progressive addition surface<br>
ensures that the distance dioptric power and the total dioptric add power needed to<br>
correct the wearer"s vision are uncompromised. It is yet another discovery of the<br>
invention that when the progressive surfaces" dioptric add power areas are<br>
misaligned with respect to one another, the resultant total maximum, localized<br>
unwanted astigmatism of the lens is less than the sum of the maximum, localized<br>
unwanted astigmatism contributed by the individual dioptric add powers of each<br>
progressive addition surface.<br>
By "progressive addition surface" is meant a continuous, aspheric surface<br>
having far and near vision zones and a zone of increasing dioptric power connecting<br>
the far and near vision zones. By "maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism" is<br>
meant the highest, measurable level of astigmatism in an area of unwanted<br>
astigmatism on a lens surface.<br>
In one embodiment, the lens of the invention comprises, consists essentially<br>
of, and consists of: a.) a first progressive addition surface having one or more areas<br>
of maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism and a first dioptric add power; and<br>
b.) a second progressive addition surface having one or more areas of maximum,<br>
localized unwanted astigmatism and a second dioptric add power, the progressive<br>
addition surfaces disposed in relation to each other so that a portion or all of the<br>
areas of maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism are misaligned and wherein the<br>
dioptric add power of the lens is the sum of the first and second dioptric add powers.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a process for producing a lens<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of the steps of: a.) providing at<br>
least a first and a second progressive addition surface, the first progressive addition<br>
surface having one or more areas of maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism and<br>
a first dioptric add power and the second progressive addition surface having one or<br>
more areas of maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism and a second dioptric add<br>
power; and b.) disposing the first and second progressive addition surfaces so that a<br>
portion or all of the areas of maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism are<br>
misaligned and the dioptric add power of the lens is the sum of the first and second<br>
dioptric add powers.<br>
By "misaligned" is meant that the surfaces, and thus the areas of unwanted<br>
astigmatism, are arranged or disposed in relation to one another so that a portion or<br>
all of the areas of maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism of one surface do not<br>
substantially coincide with one or more areas of maximum, localized unwanted<br>
astigmatism of the other surface. Preferably, the misalignment is such that no area<br>
of maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism of a surface substantially coincides<br>
with that of the other surface.<br>
The progressive addition surfaces used in the lens of the invention may be<br>
misaligned by any of a number of methods. For example, the optical centers of the<br>
surfaces may be shifted either or both laterally or vertically with respect to each<br>
other. By "optical center" is meant the point on a surface intersected by the optical<br>
axis of the lens. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that, if the optical<br>
centers are shifted laterally, the minimum channel width is reduced by the extent of<br>
the shift. Thus, a progressive addition lens design using a lateral shift preferably<br>
uses progressive addition surfaces with wider channel widths to compensate for the<br>
diminution in channel width caused by the shift.<br>
Alternatively, if the optical centers of the surfaces are shifted vertically, the<br>
channel length will be increased. By "channel length is meant the distance along the<br>
central meridian of the surface between the optical center and the top end of the near<br>
vision zone. Thus, a design using such a shift preferably uses progressive addition<br>
surfaces with shorter channel lengths in compensation.<br>
As yet another alternative, maintaining the optical centers of the progressive<br>
surfaces coincident with each other, the centers may be rotated with respect to one<br>
another. In a preferred embodiment, each surface is designed so that it is<br>
asymmetric about the center line of its channel. In this case, the areas of maximum,<br>
localized unwanted astigmatism of the surfaces do not substantially coincide on<br>
rotation of the optics about an axis joining the surfaces" optical centers. By<br>
"asymmetric" is meant that the power and astigmatism maps of the surface are<br>
asymmetric about the center meridian of the surface.<br>
The lateral and vertical shifts are done in such a way as to preserve the<br>
distance and near vision dioptric powers of the lens. In order to minimize the<br>
introduction of lens prism power, the shifts must occur so that the optical center of<br>
one progressive addition surface is shifted along a curve that is parallel to the<br>
distance curve of the other progressive addition surface. In the case of rotations, the<br>
surfaces are rotated about their optical centers so that the distance and near powers<br>
are substantially unaffected. One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
rotational misalignment may be in addition to the misalignment carried out for<br>
purposes of reducing unwanted astigmatism.<br>
The amount of misalignment, or the vertical shift, lateral shift or rotation of<br>
optical centers, is an amount sufficient to prevent substantial superposition, or<br>
coincidence, of the maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism areas of the<br>
progressive addition surfaces. More specifically, it is believed that the misalignment<br>
leads to a mismatch of the direction of the astigmatic vectors associated with one<br>
surface relative to the corresponding astigmatic vectors of the other surface resulting<br>
in the total maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism for the final lens being less<br>
than that if the vectors were aligned. The lateral or vertical shift may be about 0.1<br>
mm to about 10 mm, preferably about 1.0 mm to about 8 mm, more preferably about<br>
2.0 mm to about 4.0 mm. Rotational shifts may be about 1 to about<br>
40 degrees, preferably about 5 to about 30 degrees, more preferably about 10 to<br>
about 20 degrees.<br>
As yet another alternative for misalignment, each surface may be designed so<br>
that the channel length of the surfaces are of different lengths. In this embodiment,<br>
the areas of maximum, localized, unwanted astigmatism of the surfaces do not align<br>
when the optical centers of the surfaces are brought into alignment. As a result, the<br>
unwanted astigmatism is reduced compared to a lens of the same total dioptric add<br>
power. The greater the difference between the channel lengths, the greater will be<br>
the reduction in maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism. However, the channel<br>
lengths must not be so large as to produce a mismatch in the near vision zones so<br>
that the near vision of the lens wearer is compromised. The lens resulting from this<br>
embodiment will have a channel length falling between that of each surface and<br>
dependent upon the dioptric add power contributed by each surface to the total<br>
dioptric add power of the lens. The channel length difference between the surfaces<br>
may be about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm, preferably about 1 mm to about 7 mm, more<br>
preferably about 2 mm to about 5 mm.<br>
The progressive addition surfaces may each be independently on the convex<br>
or concave surface of the lens or in a layer between the outer concave and outer<br>
convex surfaces of the lens. Other surfaces, such as spheric and toric surfaces,<br>
designed to adapt the lens to the ophthalmic prescription of the lens" wearer may be<br>
used in combination with, or in addition to, one or more of the progressive addition<br>
surfaces.<br>
For example, one of the progressive addition surfaces, preferably a concave<br>
surface, may be combined with a toric surface to provide a toric progressive surface<br>
having a dioptric add power and a cylinder power at a particular axis. In the case of<br>
a concave, toric progressive surface, the convex surface preferably is a non-toric<br>
surface.<br>
In order to both provide the desired dioptric add power and correct for the<br>
lens wearer"s astigmatism, each of the surfaces" near vision zones may be aligned<br>
with the wearer"s pupil location during near viewing and the cylinder axis of the<br>
toric progressive surface placed so as to correspond to the wearer"s prescription.<br>
However, this method necessitates that a toric progressive surface be provided at<br>
each of the possible 180 degree cylinder axes orientations to provide a full<br>
prescriptive range of lenses. It is yet another discovery of this invention that the<br>
dioptric add power decreases slowly moving horizontally away from the center of<br>
the near vision zone to the surface"s periphery. Given this fact, a rotational<br>
misalignment of the surfaces" near vision zones of about + or - about 1 to about 25,<br>
preferably + or - about 1 to about 15, more preferably + or - about 1 to about 13<br>
degrees may be used while achieving the desired lens dioptric add power. This<br>
discovery permits limiting the number of cylinder axis and near vision zone<br>
positions used so that a toric progressive surface need not be provided at each<br>
cylinder axis degree.<br>
More specifically, a preferred process for producing a lens with a<br>
toric progressive surface is as follows. An optical preform is selected, the preform<br>
having a concave surface with a predetermined cylinder power, predetermined<br>
cylinder axis, and predetermined near vision zone location. By "optical preform" or<br>
"preform" is meant a shaped, optically transparent article capable of refracting light<br>
and possessing a convex and a concave surface, which article is suitable for use in<br>
producing a spectacle lens. The cylinder power preferably is the power required by<br>
the lens wearer. The predetermined cylinder axis may be any cylinder axis, but<br>
preferably is within a set number of degrees of the lens wearer"s required cylinder<br>
axis. The preform cylinder axis may be within about 0 to about 25 degrees,<br>
preferably about 0 to about 20 degrees, more preferably about 0 about 11 degrees of<br>
the required cylinder axis desired for the lens" wearer. Preferably, the cylinder axis<br>
orientation selected is one of a group of orientations that is less than the 180 possible<br>
orientations, more preferably the axis being one of a group of about 20 orientations,<br>
most preferably the orientation is +11.25, +33.75, + 56.25, +78.75, + 101.25,<br>
+123.75, +146.25, and +168.75 degrees relative to the three o"clock position on the<br>
preform.<br>
The preform"s concave surface near vision zone may be provided at any<br>
convenient position, but preferably is located so that its center is along the 270<br>
degree axis of the preform. In a more preferred embodiment, preform cylinder axes<br>
are provided at+11.25, +33.75, + 56.25, +78.75, + 101.25, +123.75, +146.25, or<br>
+168.75 degrees relative to the three o"clock position on the preform and the near<br>
vision zone center is located along the 270 degree axis, the six o"clock position.<br>
A convex surface is provided for the lens by using a mold suitable for casting<br>
the surface onto the preform. Preferably, the mold is suitable for the casting of a<br>
progressive surface. The mold near vision zone may be provided at any convenient<br>
position but preferably is at a position that is aligned with the near viewing pupil<br>
position of the lens wearer. Typically, this position will be on either side of the 270<br>
degree axis, the 6 o"clock position, of the mold depending on whether the left or<br>
right lens is being fabricated. Preferably, the position is within about 0 to about 20,<br>
more preferably about 5 to about 15, most preferably about 8 to about 10 degrees on<br>
either side of the 270 degree axis.<br>
The selected preform is positioned, or rotated, in relation to the mold<br>
selected so that the cylinder axis of the resulting lens will be that required by the<br>
lens wearer. For example, if the lens wearer"s required cylinder axis is 180 degrees<br>
for the left eye and the optical preform cylinder power is at the 11.25 degree axis,<br>
with the near vision zone at 270 degrees, the preform is rotated so that its cylinder<br>
axis falls along the mold"s 180 degree axis. This aligns the cylinder axis of the<br>
preform to the wearer"s required cylinder axis. It will be recognized that the rotation<br>
of the preform in relation to the mold also produces a rotational misalignment of the<br>
preform and mold near vision zones. However, this rotational misalignment is<br>
tolerable up to about + or - 25 degrees for purposes of achieving the desired lens<br>
dioptric add power.<br>
Thus, in yet another embodiment, the invention provides a process for<br>
producing a progressive addition lens for a lens wearer, and lenses produced by the<br>
process, comprising, consisting essentially of and consisting of: a.) providing an<br>
optical preform comprising at least one surface having a predetermined first<br>
cylinder axis, a predetermined cylinder power, and a predetermined first near vision<br>
zone position; b.) providing a mold for casting a surface onto the optical preform,<br>
the mold comprising a second near vision zone position that is aligned with the lens<br>
wearer"s near viewing pupil location; and c.) positioning the preform in relation to<br>
the mold in order to provide the resulting lens with a cylinder axis desired for the<br>
lens wearer.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the process, an optical preform is provided<br>
with at least one surface, preferably the convex surface, having a near vision zone,<br>
preferably a progressive addition surface. The near vision zone of this surface is<br>
aligned with the lens wearer"s near viewing pupil location. A mold suitable for<br>
casting a toric surface onto the preform is used, the mold having a predetermined<br>
cylinder axis, cylinder power, and near vision zone location as above-described.<br>
Thus, in an alternative embodiment, a process is provided for producing a<br>
progressive addition lens for a lens wearer, and lenses produced by the process,<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of and consisting of: a.) providing an optical<br>
preform comprising at least one surface having a first near vision zone position that<br>
is aligned with the lens wearer"s near viewing pupil location; b.) providing a mold<br>
for casting a surface onto the optical preform, the mold comprising a predetermined<br>
first cylinder axis, predetermined a cylinder power, and a predetermined second<br>
near vision zone position; and c.) positioning the preform in relation to the mold in<br>
order to provide the resulting lens with a cylinder axis desired for the lens wearer.<br><br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that any number of a wide<br>
variety of predetermined cylinder axes and near vision zone placements may be<br>
used. However, it is preferred that the predetermined cylinder axes and near vision<br>
zone placements be selected from those shown on Table 1 for the listed lens cylinder<br>
axis prescription requirements.<br>
For the lenses and processes of the invention, the dioptric add power of each<br>
of the progressive addition surfaces used in the invention is selected so that the sum<br>
of their dioptric add powers is substantially equal to the value needed to correct the<br>
lens wearer"s near vision acuity. Additionally, the dioptric add power of each<br>
surface is selected in view of the maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism<br>
associated with a given near dioptric power. The dioptric add power of the<br>
progressive addition surfaces may be each independently from about + 0.01 diopters<br>
to about +3.00 diopters, preferably from about +0.25 diopters to about +2.00<br>
diopters, more preferably about +0.50 to about +1.50 diopters.<br>
Similarly, the distance and near dioptric powers for each surface are selected<br>
so that the sum of the powers is the value needed to correct the wearer"s distance<br>
and near vision. Generally, the distance dioptric power for each surface will be<br>
within the range of about 0.25 diopters to about 8.50 diopters. Preferably, the<br>
dioptric power of the distance zone of the concave surface may be + or - about<br>
2.00 to about 5.50 diopters and for the convex surface, + or - about 0.5 to about 8.00<br>
diopters. The near vision dioptric power for each of the surfaces will be about 1.00<br>
diopters to about 12.00 diopters. In those embodiments in which a cylinder power is<br>
used, the cylinder power may be about -0.125 to about -6.00 diopters, preferably<br>
about -0.25 to about -3.00 diopters.<br>
The progressive addition surfaces and lenses of the invention may be formed<br>
by any convenient method such as, without limitation, thermoforming, molding,<br>
grinding, casting or the like. In a preferred method, an optical preform having a<br>
progressive addition surface is used and a second progressive addition surface is cast<br>
onto the preform. In a more preferred method, a preform the concave surface of<br>
which is a progressive addition surface with a base spherical power and a cylinder<br>
power is used and a progressive addition surface is formed on the front surface by<br>
any convenient method, preferably by casting and more preferably by surface<br>
casting.<br>
The invention will be clarified further by a consideration of the following,<br>
non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Referring to FIG. la, lens 10 of the invention is shown having convex<br>
progressive addition surface 11 and concave progressive addition surface 12. Surface<br>
11 has distance zone 13 with a curvature of 6.00 diopters and near zone 18 with a<br>
curvature of 7.00 diopters. Surface 12 has distance zone 19 with a curvature of 6.00<br>
diopters and near zone 21 with a curvature of 5.00 diopters. The resulting distance<br>
power of the lens is 0.00 diopters and the dioptric add power of the lens is 2.00<br>
diopters, 1.00 diopters contributed by each of surfaces 11 and 12. As shown in FIG.<br>
la, the convex and concave optical centers 16 and 17, respectively, are shifted with<br>
respect to each other by 4.0 mm.<br>
FIG. lb is an astigmatism map of lens 10 illustrating the misalignment of the<br>
surfaces. Areas 22 and 23 are of the unwanted astigmatism for surfaces 11 and 12,<br>
respectively. The locations of the maximum, localized astigmatism 14 and 15 do not<br>
overlap and, thus, are not additive. The maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism<br>
value of 1.90 D for this lens is shown in Table 1 and is significantly lower than the<br>
2.20 D that is found in a conventional PAL of the same near dioptric power.<br>
Example 2<br>
A lens with two progressive addition surfaces is used, the misalignment for<br>
which is 8.00 mm. The misalignment results in a reduction of maximum localized u<br>
unwanted astigmatism of 0.30 D compared to the prior art Lens of Table 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
As shown in FIGs. 2a and 2b, lens 20 with a concave progressive addition<br>
surface 25 is seen. Surface 25 has distance and near zone curvatures of 6.00 and 5.00<br>
diopters, respectively. Convex surface 24 with distance and near zone curvatures of<br>
6.00 and 7.00 diopters is also shown. The optical center 27 of surface 25 is rotated<br>
by a, an amount of 10 degrees, with respect to that of optical center 26 of convex<br>
progressive surface 24. In FIG. 2b, the astigmatism map of lens 20 is shown. Areas<br>
31 and 32 depict the areas of unwanted astigmatism for surfaces 24 and 25,<br>
respectively. Maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism areas 28 and 29 for<br>
surfaces 24 and 25, respectively, are also shown. Table 2 shows that the resulting<br>
lens has a maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism of 1.90 diopters as compared to<br>
2.10 diopters for a prior art lens.<br>
Examples 4-6<br>
The concave progressive addition surface of a lens is rotated around its<br>
optical center by 20, 30, and 40 degrees with respect to the convex progressive<br>
addition surface. The rotations result in maximum, localized unwanted astigmatisms<br>
of 1.85, 1.75, and 1.41 diopters, respectively as listed on Table 2.<br>
Example 7<br>
FIG. 3 depicts a concave progressive addition surface 34 placed between<br>
surfaces 33 and 35 of lens 30. Lens 30 is made of an optical preform 38 having a<br>
refractive index of 1.60 and a cast layer 39 having a refractive index of 1.50.<br>
Convex surface 33 of preform 38 has optical center 36, a distance curvature of 6.50<br>
diopters and a near curvature of 8.50 diopters. Concave surface 34 of preform 38 has<br>
optical center 37, a distance curvature ("DC") of 6.50 diopters and a near curvature<br>
("NC") of 0.50 diopters derived by the formula:<br>
wherein n1 is the refractive index of optical preform 38 and n2 is the refractive index<br>
of layer 39. Optical center 37 is shifted vertically downwards 4 mm with respect to<br>
optical center 36. Concave surface 35 of layer 39 includes a cylindrical power of<br>
-2.00 D for correcting the wearer"s astigmatism. Lens 30 has a distance power of<br>
0.00 diopters, a total dioptric add power of 3.00 diopters, arrived at by the 2.00<br>
diopter dioptric add power of surface 33 and the 1.00 diopters dioptric add power of<br>
surface 34 combined. The maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism is lower than<br>
that of a conventional lens with a 3.00 diopters dioptric add power.<br>
Example 8<br>
In FIG. 4a is depicted lens 50 having convex surface 51 and concave surface<br>
52. Surface 51 is a progressive addition surface with optical center 53. Surface 52 is<br>
a combination progressive addition-toric surface having optical center 54 shifted<br>
vertically downwards 4 mm with respect to optical center 53. FIG. 4b depicts the<br>
astigmatism map for lens 50 showing the shift. Areas 55 and 56 are the areas of<br>
unwanted astigmatism, 57 and 58 being their respective maximum, localized<br>
unwanted astigmatism areas respectively, for surfaces 51 and 52. I-I is the toric axis<br>
for surface 52. The overlap of the progressive addition surfaces are such that,<br>
although the near and distance vision zones are preserved, the location of the<br>
maximum, localized unwanted astigmatisms 57 and 58 of each surface do not<br>
coincide and, thus, their effect is not additive.<br>
Example 9<br>
Lens 60 is depicted in FIG. 5a in which a left oriented, convex progressive<br>
addition surface 61 shown combined with a right oriented, concave progressive<br>
addition surface 62. Each surface is depicted individually in FIGs. 5b and 5c,<br>
respectively. Optical centers 63 and 64 of each surface are rotated so as to become<br>
optically aligned. In FIG. 5d is depicted that the left and right orientation of the<br>
surfaces provides misalignment of the unwanted astigmatism areas 65 and 66 of<br>
surfaces 61 and 62, respectively. The maximum, localized unwanted astigmatism<br>
for lens 60 of 1.70 diopters listed on Table 3.<br>
Example 10<br>
An optical preform is produced containing a spherical, convex surface with a<br>
curvature of 6.00 diopters. The preform concave surface is a toric-progressive<br>
surface with a base spherical curvature of 6.00 diopters, a cylinder power of-2.00<br>
diopters at an axis of 11.25 degrees, and near vision zone with a dioptric add power<br>
of 1.00 diopters. The near vision zone is centered along the 270 degree axis of the<br>
preform. A progressive addition glass mold for a left lens is provided to surface cast<br>
a UV curable resin layer onto the convex surface of the preform using conventional<br>
surface casting techniques. The mold has a 6.00 diopter base curvature and a 1.00<br>
dioptric add power with the near vision zone along the 262 degree axis of the mold (8<br>
degrees counterclockwise from the vertical). The preform is rotated<br>
counterclockwise, relative to the glass mold 11.25 degrees so that the cylinder axis<br>
falls at the mold"s 0 degrees axis, the axis desired for the lens. The rotational<br>
misalignment of the concave surface and convex surface near vision zones will be<br>
11.25 - 8 = 3.25 degrees. The resultant lens has a distance power of 0.00 diopters, a<br>
cylinder power of-2.00 diopters at 0 degree axis, and a dioptric add power of 2.00<br>
diopters.<br>
