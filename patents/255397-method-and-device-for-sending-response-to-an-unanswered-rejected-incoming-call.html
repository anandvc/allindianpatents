				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of mobile and other forms of telecommunication. Further, this invention relates to messaging in mobiles and other means of telecommunication. More particularly, this invention relates to system and method for quick messaging service in telecommunication devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
When one receives an incoming call, the following options are available to handle the incoming call:<br>
•	Answer the call<br>
•	Reject the call<br>
•	Leave as a missed call (don't do anything)<br>
OPERATION OF RELATED ART<br>
Recent mobile features allow user's to configure profiles (meeting/silent etc.). These allow for incoming calls to be listed as missed calls. Only options available are to either to accept the call or reject the call or to put the phone on silent mode.<br>
There is no option to inform the caller why the receiver could not take the call. The calling party does not know when to retry.<br><br>
The following are the weaknesses of the existing approach:<br>
•	The called party may get a number of missed calls from same user. This may be annoying in certain situations like conference / meetings etc.<br>
•	The calling side has no mechanism to know why the user is not answering the call and may keep on trying. This may be annoying for the calling side also.<br>
•	Leads to wastage of N/W resources, if the calling party keeps on trying again and again.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the current Ul available to the user for handling of Incoming Call in the prior art. Here you can see that the only three options available to the user are: Accept: To answer the call<br>
Silent: To put the phone on silent mode Reject: To Reject the call<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Common observation is that when a user is in meeting/conference/trainings etc., he finds it difficult to take the calls. In the current approach User can either accept the call or reject the call or leave as a missed call. There is no mechanism of informing the Calling party about the Called party Status. This can be sometimes very annoying for both the Calling and Called party.<br><br>
The New Approach gives more Flexibility to the User in handling Incoming Call. In the New Approach a new option (Send Preconfigured QMS and disconnect the call) is provided to the user through which the User can send Preconfigured QMS to the Calling Party whenever he wishes. Many advantages associated with this new approach are mentioned in later sections.<br>
The number of Preconfigured QMS is Implementation dependent.<br>
Accordingly, this invention comprises:<br>
•	A method by which user can send QMS response(to the calling party) for an Incoming call.<br>
•	The method as above, further providing the user with the option of selecting through the available preconfigured QMS's.<br>
•	The method as above, further providing the user with the option of setting the Time after which automated QMS response will be generated (when call is neither answered nor rejected).<br>
•	The method as above, further providing the user with the option of sending QMS response for an Incoming call, only to the members belonging to a group(such as VIP, Family, Friends etc.) or groups.<br>
•	A method by which user can send QMS response just by pressing any of the key between 0-9(including both).<br>
•	The method as above, further providing the user with the option of setting the keys(0-9) with a particular QMS.<br><br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method of quick message service in telecommunication devices comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	presenting plurality of    options on receiving an incoming call in the communication device of the call receiver;<br>
(b)	presenting the call receiver with a list of preconfigured QMS's; and<br>
(c)	choosing and sending a preconfigured message and disconnecting the call by the call receiver,<br>
wherein the call receiver can disconnect the call first and send a preconfigured message to the caller later.<br>
The invention further comprises of configuring auto answering with default QMS message to send QMS message after certain time duration. The time duration is configured by the user on unanswered incoming call. The said QMS messages are adapted to configure to send to groups or everyone. When the said QMS messages are adapted to configure to send to groups QMS is sent if the caller belongs to a configured group or groups. When the said QMS messages are adapted to configure to send to everyone QMS is sent to caller irrespective of whether the said caller belongs to a group or groups. The call receiver sends QMS message by pressing any of the keys of the communication device. The call receiver has the option of setting the mobile device keys with a particular QMS.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a system of quick message service in mobiles device and other means of telecommunication equipment comprising:<br><br>
(a)	means for presenting plurality of options on receiving an incoming call in the mobile device of the call receiver;<br>
(b)	means for presenting the call receiver with a list of preconfigured QMS's; and<br>
(c)	means   for   choosing   and   sending   a   preconfigured   message   and disconnecting the call by the call receiver,<br>
wherein the call receiver can disconnect the call first and send a preconfigured message to the caller later.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description of the drawings taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
