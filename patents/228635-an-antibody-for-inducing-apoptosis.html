Methods and Compositions for Inducing Apoptosis in Cancer Cells<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS [01]     The present application claims benefit to the following four U.S. Provisional Patent Applications: 60/504,901, filed September 22, 2003; 60/494,714, filed August 12,2003; 60/448,960, filed February 21, 2003; and 60/429,842, filed November 27, 2002, each of which are incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [02]     Apoptosis is a highly conserved cell suicide program essential for development and tissue homeostasis of all metazoan organisms. Changes to the apoptotic pathway that prevent or delay normal cell turnover can be just as important in the pathogenesis of diseases as are abnormalities in the regulation of the cell cycle. Like cell division, which is controlled through complex interactions between cell cycle regulatory proteins, apoptosis is similarly regulated under normal circumstances by the interaction of gene products that either prevent or induce cell death.<br>
[03]     TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, also referred to as Apo2L) is a member of the TNF cytokine family. Upon binding to DR4 or DR5, two members of the TNF receptor super family, TRAIL induces cell death by apoptosis. See, e.g., Pan etal, Science 277:815-8 (1997); Sheridan, et al, Science 277:818-21 3 (1997); Walczak et al, EMBO1 16:5386-97 4 (1997). In vitro, TRAIL has been shown to kill tumor cells, but is relatively non-toxic to normal cells.<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
[27]     "Antibody" refers to a polypeptide comprising a framework region from an immunoglobulin gene or fragments thereof that specifically binds and recognizes an antigen. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.<br>
[28]     Naturally occurring immunoglobulins have a common core structure in which two identical light chains (about 24 kD) and two identical heavy chains (about 55 or 70 kD) form a tetramer. The amino-terminal portion of each chain is known as the variable (V) region and can be distinguished from the more conserved constant (C) regions of the remainder of each chain. Within the variable region of the light chain is a C-tenninal portion<br><br>
known as the J region. Within the variable region of the heavy chain, there is a D region in addition to the J region. Most of the amino acid sequence variation in immunoglobulins is confined to three separate locations in the V regions known as hypervariable regions or complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which are directly involved in antigen binding. Proceeding from the amino-terminus, these regions are designated CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, respectively. The CDRs are held in place by more conserved framework regions (FRs). Proceeding from the amino-terminus, these regions are designated FRI, FR2, FR3, and FR4, respectively. The locations of CDR and FR regions and a numbering system have been defined by, e.g., Kabat et aL (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Government Printing Office (1991)).<br>
[29]     An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.<br>
[30]     Antibodies exist, e.g., as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)f2, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to VH-CHI by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)r2 may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)'2 dimer into an Fab' monomer. The Fab* monomer is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region (see FUNDAMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY (Paul ed., 3d ed. 1993). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by using recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies, or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies (e.g., single chain Fv) or those identified using phage display libraries (see, e.g., McCafferty et al, Nature 348:552-554(1990)).<br>
[31]     For preparation of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, any technique known in the art can be used {see, e.g.9 Kohler &amp; Milstein, Nature 256:495-497 (1975); Kozbor et al, Immunology Today 4:72 (1983); Cole et a/., pp. 77-96 in Monoclonal<br><br>
Antibodies and Cancer Therapy (1985)). "Monoclonal" antibodies refer to antibodies derived from a single clone. Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778) can be adapted to produce antibodies to polypeptides of this invention. Also, transgenic mice, or other organisms such as other mammals, maybe used to express humanized antibodies. Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to identify antibodies and heteromenc Fab fragments that specifically bind to selected antigens (see, e.g., McCafferty et al, Nature 348:552-554 (1990); Marks et al, Biotechnology 10:779-783 (1992)).<br>
[32]     A "chimeric antibody" is an antibody molecule in which (a) the constant region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged so that the antigen binding site (variable region) is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class, effector function and/or species, or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody, e.g., an enzyme, toxin, hormone, growth factor, drug, etc.; or (b) the variable region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged with a variable region having a different or altered antigen specificity.<br>
[33]     A "humanized" antibody is an antibody that retains the reactivity of a non-human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. This can be achieved, for instance, by retaining the non-human CDR regions and replacing the remaining parts of the antibody with their human counterparts. See, e.g., Morrison et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984); Morrison and Oi, Adv. Immunol, 44:65-92 (1988); Verhoeyen et al, Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988); Padlan, Molec. Immun., 28:489-498 (1991); Padlan, Molec. Immun., 31(3):169-217 (1994).<br>
[34]     The phrase "specifically (or selectively) binds" to an antibody or "specifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with," when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologies. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least two times the background and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. This selection may be achieved by subtracting out antibodies that cross-react with, e.g., DR5 molecules from other species. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein (see, e.g.,<br><br>
Harlow &amp; Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual (1988), for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity). Typically a specific or selective reaction will be at least twice background signal or noise and more typically more than 10 to 100 times background.<br>
[35]     The terms "peptidomimetic" and 'mimetic" refer to a synthetic chemical compound that has substantially the same structural and functional characteristics of a naturally or non-naturally occurring polypeptide (e.g., SMAC). Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed "peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics" (Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al 1 Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference). Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent or enhanced therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity), such as found in a polypeptide of interest, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of, e.g., -CH2NH-, -CH2S-, -CH2-CH2-:, -CH=CH- (cis and trans), -COCH2-, -CH(OH)CH2~, and -CH2SO-. The mimetic can be either entirely composed of synthetic, non-natural analogues of amino acids, or, is a chimeric molecule of partly natural peptide amino acids and partly non-natural analogs of amino acids. The mimetic can also incorporate any amount of natural amino acid conservative substitutions as long as such substitutions also do not substantially alter the mimetic's structure and/or activity. For example, a mimetic composition is within the scope of the invention if it is capable of carrying out at least one of the binding or enzymatic activities of a polypeptide of interest.<br>
[36]     "siRNA" refers to small interfering RNAs, that are capable of causing interference and can cause post-transcriptional silencing of specific genes in cells, for example, mammalian cells (including human cells) and in the body, for example, mammalian bodies (including humans). The phenomenon of RNA interference is described and discussed in Bass, Nature 411: 428-29 (2001); Elbahir et aL9 Nature 411: 494-98 (2001); and Fire et aL, Nature 391: 806-11 (1998); and WO 01/75164, where methods of making interfering RNA also are discussed. The siRNAs based upon the sequences and nucleic acids encoding the gene products disclosed herein typically have fewer than 100 base pairs and can be, e.g., about 30 bps or shorter, and can be made by approaches known in the art, including<br><br>
the use of complementary DNA strands or synthetic approaches. The siRNAs are capable of causing interference and can cause post-transcriptional silencing of specific genes in cells, for example, mammalian cells (including human cells) and in the body, for example, mammalian bodies (including humans). Exemplary siRNAs according to the invention could have up to 29 bps, 25 bps, 22 bps, 21 bps, 20 bps, 15 bps, 10 bps, 5 bps or any integer thereabout or therebetween. Tools for designing optimal inhibitory siRNAs include that available from DNAengine Inc. (Seattle, WA) and Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX).<br>
[37]     One RNAi technique employs genetic constructs within which sense and anti-sense sequences are placed in regions flanking an intron sequence in proper splicing orientation with donor and acceptor splicing sites. Alternatively, spacer sequences of various lengths maybe employed to separate self-complementary regions of sequence in the construct. During processing of the gene construct transcript, intron sequences are spliced-out, allowing sense and anti-sense sequences, as well as splice junction sequences, to bind forming double-stranded RNA. Select ribonucleases then bind to and cleave the double-stranded RNA, thereby initiating the cascade of events leading to degradation of specific mRNA gene sequences, and silencing specific genes.<br>
[38]     "Nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs).<br>
[39]     Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et a/., J. Biol Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini et al, Mol Cell Probes 8:91-98 (1994)). The term "nucleic acid" encompasses the terms gene, cDNA, mRNA, oligonucleotide, and polynucleotide.<br><br>
{40]     The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymer.<br>
[41]     The term "amino acid" refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, .gamma.-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine.* Amino acid analogs refer to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an .alpha, carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.<br>
[42]     "Conservatively modified variants" applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are "silent variations," which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.<br><br>
[43]     As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a "conservatively modified variant" where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention.<br>
[44]     The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another:<br>
1)	Alanine (A), Glycine (G);<br>
2)	Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);<br>
3)	Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);<br>
4)	Arginine (R), Lysine (K);<br>
5)	Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);<br>
6)	Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);<br>
7)	Serine (S), Threonine (T); and<br>
8)	Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) [see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins (1984)).<br>
[45]     'Tercentage of sequence identity" is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (Le., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (e.g., a polypeptide of the invention), which does not comprise additions or deletions, for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.<br>
[46]     The terms "identical" or percent "identity," in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same sequences. Two sequences are "substantially identical" if two sequences have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (i.e., 60% identity, optionally 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identity over a specified region, or, when not specified, over the entire sequence), when compared and aligned for<br><br>
maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. The invention provides polypeptides or polynucleotides that are substantially identical to the polypeptides or polynucleotides, respectively, exemplified herein (e.g., the CDRs exemplified in Figures 23-25). Optionally, the identity exists over a region that is at least about 50 nucleotides in length, or more preferably over a region that is 100 to 500 or 1000 or more nucleotides in length.<br>
[47]     For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.<br>
.    [48]     A "comparison window", as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1970) Adv. Appl Math. 2:482c, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol Biol 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nat'L Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995 supplement)).<br>
[49]     Two examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1977) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al (1990) J. Mol Biol 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short<br><br>
words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al, supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &gt; 0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always 
[50]     The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (seet e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N))&gt; which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.<br>
[51]     An indication that two nucleic acid sequences or polypeptides are substantially identical is that the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with the antibodies raised against the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid, as described below. Thus, a polypeptide is typically substantially identical to a second polypeptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by conservative substitutions. Another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the two molecules or their complements hybridize to each other<br><br>
under stringent conditions, as described below. Yet another indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the same primers can be used to amplify the sequence.<br>
[52]     The term "affinity agent agonist" refers to an affinity agent (i.e., a molecule that specifically binds a target molecule) capable of activating a receptor to induce a full or partial receptor-mediated response. For example, an agonist of DR4 or DR5 binds to DR4 or DR5 and induces DR4 or DR5-mediated signaling. In some embodiments, a DR4 or DR5 affinity agent agonist can be identified by its ability to bind to DR4 or DR5 and induce apoptosis when contacted to Jurkat cells. An "antibody agonist" refers to the situation where the affinity agent is an antibody.<br>

Antagonists include agents that directly inhibit activity and agents that indirectly inhibit activity through decreasing expression or stability of target molecule mRNA (e.g., siRNAs) or protein.<br>

All but one of the known IAP proteins share a twofold or threefold repeat of a characteristic sequence motif, the Baculovirus Inhibitory Repeat (BIR; -70 residues; survivin is a recently discovered human IAP that contains one BIR region). This BIR region contains a number of conserved residues, with the consensus sequence: R-X(20-23)-G-X(l 1)-C-X(2)-C-X(16&gt;H-X(6)-C.

[59]     "SMAC" refers to a mitochondrial polypeptide, which is released together with cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. SMAC promotes caspase activation by binding and neutralizing the IAPs. See, e.g., Du et al, Cell 102:33-42 (2000); Verhagen et al, Cell 102:43-53 (2000).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
J.	Introduction<br>
[96]     The present invention demonstrates the surprising result that anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibody agonists administered with an apoptosis-inducing agent induces apoptosis in cancer cells in a synergistic fashion. Thus cancer cells that are resistant to treatment by one of these components alone will likely be killed when contacted by an anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 agonist antibody and a second apoptosis-inducing agent. In addition, of those cells that would go through apoptosis upon contact with one of the above-listed components, contact with anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 agonist antibody and an apoptosis-inducing protein will lead to a faster induction of apoptosis.<br>
[97]     The present invention also provides high potency DR5 agonist antibodies and their use to induce apoptosis in cancer cells.<br>
II.       Anti-DR4 or DR5 antibodies 1.        Introduction<br>
[98]     Any anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibody agonist can be used according to the methods of the invention. DR4 (also referred to as Death Receptor 4) and DR5 (also referred to as Death Receptor 5) are two receptors of the ligand TRAIL. See, e.g., Pan et al, Science 277:815-8 (1997); Sheridan, et al, Science 277:818-21 3 (1997); Walczak et al, EMBO J. 16:5386-97 4 (1997). Anti-DR5 antibodies have been described previously in, e.g., PCT WO 01/83560 (antibody TRA-8; ATCC PTA-1428) and PCT WO 02/079377. In addition, anti-DR5 antibody agonists are described herein. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an exemplary anti-DR5 antibody agonist are provided in Figures 23-25. In some embodiments, the anti-DR5 antibodies compete with the exemplified antibody for binding to DR5. In some embodiments, the DR5 antibody agonists have CDRs that are substantially similar to the CDRs exemplified in Figures 24, 25 or both.<br>
[99]     Any type of antibody agonist may be used according to the methods of the invention. Generally, the antibodies used are monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies can be generated by any method known in the art (e.g., using hybridomas, recombinant expression and/or phage display).<br><br>
[100]   The antibodies of the invention need not be cross-linked or otherwise treated prior to administration. However, in some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are cross-linked. Cross-linking (e.g., using hetero- or homo-bifunctional chemical cross-linkers) is well known in the art. Alternatively, stable multivalent Fabs (e.g., trimers or tetramers, etc.) can be administered. See, e.g., PCT WO 99/27964.<br>
[101] Exemplary anti-DR5 antibodies include those with the specificity of an<br>
antibody comprising the light and heavy chain variable region sequences displayed in Figures<br>
24 and 25. In some embodiments, the antibody is Antibody A (ATCC Deposit No.	).<br>
[102]   In numerous embodiments, the anti-DR5 antibodies of the invention do not bind to other polypeptides. In-some embodiments, the ant-DR5 antibodies do not bind any other receptor in the TNF receptor family (e.g., TNFR2, TNFR3, OX40, CD40, FAS, DcR3, CD27, CD30, CD137, DR4, DcRl, DcR2, RANK, OPG, DR3, TR2, NGFR, TNFR1, and TAC1). In some embodiments, the ant-DR5 antibodies do not bind to DR4, DTR1, DTR2 or OPG.<br>
[103]   The anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibodies of the invention can be extremely potent. For example, in some embodiments, in a standard subcutaneous tumor ablation assay, the antibodies of the invention can reduce tumor size by 50% at a concentration of 1 Or less mg/kg body weight (and in some embodiments, 0.50 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, or 0.01 mg/kg or less) when administered to an animal 3 times a week for two weeks and ablates tumors completely when ten times that amount is used.<br>
[104]   In some cases, the anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibodies of the invention are designed to lack or have a reduced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). For example, in some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention comprise an IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-2A, IgG 3 or IgG-4 Fc region.<br>
[105]   A number of different synthetic molecular scaffolds can be used to display the variable light and heavy chain sequences displayed in Figures 24 and 25. A publication describing use of the fibronectin type III domain (FN3) as a specific molecular scaffold on which to display peptides including CDRS is Koide, A. et al. J. MoL Biol 284:1141-1151(1988). Other scaffolding alternatives include, e.g., "minibodies" (Pessi, A. et al, Nature 362:367-369 (1993)), tendamistat (McConnell, S. J. and Hoess, R. H. J. MoL Biol 250:460-470 (1995)), and "camelized" VH domain (Davies J. and Riechmann, L. BiolTechnology 13:475-479 (1995)). Other scaffolds that are not based on the immunoglobulin like folded structure are reviewed in Nygren, P. A. and Uhlen, M. Curr. Opin. Struct Biol 7:463-469 (1997). U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,380 describes additional scaffolds.<br><br>
The term "affinity agents" encompasses molecules comprising synthetic molecular scaffolds such as those described above to display binding domains with a binding specificity for DR4 or DR5, including the specificities described for antibodies described herein.<br>
2.        Humanized Antibodies<br>
[106]   In some embodiments, the antibody used according to the present invention is a chimeric (e.g., mouse/human) antibody made up of regions from a non-human anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibody agonist together with regions of human antibodies. For example, a chimeric H chain can comprise the antigen binding region of the heavy chain variable region (e.g., the sequence displayed in Figure 24 or Figure 35) of the non-human antibody linked to at least a portion of a human heavy chain constant region. This humanized or chimeric heavy chain may be combined with a chimeric L chain that comprises the antigen binding region of the light chain variable region (e.g., the sequence displayed in Figure 25 or Figure 35) of the non-human antibody linked to at least a portion of the human light chain constant region. In some embodiments, the heavy chain constant region can be an IgM or IgA antibody.<br>
[107]   The chimeric antibodies of the invention may be monovalent, divalent, or polyvalent immunoglobulins. For example, a monovalent chimeric antibody is a dimer (HL) formed by a chimeric H chain associated through disulfide bridges with a chimeric L chain, as noted above. A divalent chimeric antibody is a tetramer (H2 L2) formed by two HL dimers associated through at least one disulfide bridge. A polyvalent chimeric antibody is based on an aggregation of chains.<br>

3.	Single Chain Antibodies<br>
[110]   In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are single chain antibodies. Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,258,498; Huston et aL, Methods in Enzymology 203:46-88 (1991); Shu et al, Proa Natl Acad. Scl USA 90:7995-7999 (1993); and Skerra et aL, Science 240:1038-1040 (1988).<br>
4.	Human Antibodies<br>
[111]   In some embodiments, human antibodies are used according to the present invention. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including by using phage display methods using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See, e.g., Lonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol 13:65-93 (1995), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98/46645, WO 98/50433, WO 98/24893, WO 98/16654, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735, and WO 91/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[112]   In some embodiments, the antibodies of the present invention are generated using phage display. For example, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles that carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. Such phage can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or<br><br>
combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds DR4 or DR5 can be selected or identified with DR4 or DR5, e.g., using labeled DR4 or DR5. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and Ml 3 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene HI or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et aL, J. Immunol Methods 182:41-50 (1995); Ames et aL, J. Immunol. Methods 184:177-186 (1995); Kettleborough et aL, Eur. J. Immunol. 24:952-958 (1994); Persic et aL, Gene 187:9-18 (1997); Burton et aL, Advances in Immunology 57:191-280 (1994); PCT application No. PCT/GB91/01134; PCT publications WO 90/02809; WO 91/10737; WO 92/01047; WO 92/18619; WO 93/11236; WO 95/15982; WO 95/20401; and U.S. Pat.Nos. 5,698,426; 5,223,409; 5,403,484; 5,580,717; 5,427,908; 5,750,753; 5,821,047; 5,571,698; 5,427,908; 5,516,637; 5,780,225; 5,658,727; 5,733,743 and 5,969,108; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
5*        Generating agonist antibodies<br>
[113]   Agonist antibodies can be identified by generating anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibodies and then testing each antibody for the ability trigger DR4 or DR5 mediated events, e.g., inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell. A variety of assays known in the art can be used to detect induction of apoptosis.<br>
[114]   In one assay, DOHH-2 or Jurkat cells are contacted with a candidate antibody agonist and then monitored for viability as a function of antibody concentration. Reduced cell viability (e.g., caused by increased apoptosis) with increased antibody concentration indicates that the antibody is an agonist. Cell viability can be assayed by adding Alamar blue, which fluoresces in the presence of living, but not dead, cells. As described in the Examples, agonist antibodies can be identified by screening hybridomas raised against DR4 or DR5 and then screening the hybridoma supernatant for the ability to induce apoptosis in DOHH-2 or Jurkat cells. Appropriate positive and negative controls can be used to confirm the results. For example, a cell line that does not go through DR4 or DR5-mediated TRAIL induced apoptosis should not go through apoptosis in response to a candidate anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 agonist.<br><br>

In some embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent preferentially induces apoptosis in cancer cells compared to non-cancer cells. Typically the apoptosis-inducing agents are agonists or activators of apoptosis or antagonists of inhibitors of apoptosis.<br>

Additional exemplary apoptosis-inducing agents include, e.g., agents that enhance DR5 and DR4 expression and/or stability, agents that enhance caspase activity or stability, and agents that induce or enhance a DNA damage response. Agonist or mimetics in the above list include the gene products themselves (e.g., p53 is a p53 agonist), as well as agonist antibodies. Antagonists include agents that directly inhibit activity (e.g., antagonist antibodies) and agents that indirectly inhibit activity through decreasing expression or stability of target molecule mRNA (e.g., siRNAs) or protein.<br>
[117]   Apoptosis-inducing agents that can be identified by targeting these gene products include compounds of various chemical natures. For example, modulators of these gene products can be screened with libraries of polypeptides, beta-turn mimetics, polysaccharides, phospholipids, hormones, prostaglandins, steroids, aromatic compounds, heterocyclic compounds, benzodiazepines, oligomeric N-substituted glycines, oligocarbamates, polypeptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof.<br>
[118]   In some embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent is a polynucleotide. For example, it can be an siRNA targeting a gene that inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis (e.g., UbcHIO or molecules listed in the first portion of Figure 27). In some embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent is a small molecule compound (e.g., a molecule with a molecular weight of less than 1500 Daltons and in some cases, less than 1000 Daltons). For example, the apoptosis-inducing agent can be a small molecule compound that inhibits expression or activity of a gene product that inhibit TRAJL-induced<br><br>
apoptosis (e.g., UbcHlO or molecules listed in the first portion of Figure 27). The apoptosis-inducing agent can also be a small molecule compound that enhanced expression or activity of a gene product that promote TRAJL-induced apoptosis (e.g., UbcHlO or molecules listed in the bottom portion of Figure 27). Methods for screening modulators (including small molecule modulators) of a gene and its encoded polypeptide, and methods for preparing siRNA or other inhibitory polynucleotides of a known gene are all well known in the art. See, e.g., US Patent Nos. 6,573,099 and 6,506,559; Principles and Practice of High Throughput Screening, K. Murray (Ed.), CRC Press (2003); High Throughput Screening: Methods and Protocols, W. Janzen (Ed.), Humana Press (2002); PCT publications WO 95/35503, WO 95/30642, and WO 91/18980; Schultz et al, BioorgMed Chem Lett 8:2409-2414,1998; and Weller et al, MolDivers. 3:61-70, 1997. Additional methods that can be employed for screening modulators of these genes and their products are disclosed in, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, N.Y., 3rd Ed. (2000); and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1999).<br>
[119] In some embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent is conjugated to the anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibody agonist. In other embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent is not conjugated to the anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibody agonist.<br>
[120]   In some embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent is not TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, AIM I, AIM II, Fas Ligand, or VEGI.<br>
1.        SMAC<br>
[121]   In some embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent is SMAC/Diablo or a SMAC mimetic or agonist. SMAC/Diablo promotes caspase activity by binding Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). See, e.g., Dufet al, Cell 102:33-42 (2000); Verhagen etal, Cell 102:43-53, 2000; U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0110851. Administration or expression of SMAC in cells is encompassed by the present invention. SMAC fragments, such as the N-terminal peptides of SMAC (e.g., the N-terminal tetra or heptapeptides (Guo et al, Blood 99(9):3419-3426 (2002); Srinivasula et al, 1 Biol Chem. 275:36152-36157 (2000)), can also be expressed or administered. See, also, U.S. Patent Application 2002/0132786.<br>
[122]   In addition, SMAC mimetic compounds can also be used according to the present invention. These compounds can have useful pharmaceutical properties and as such can be more efficient for administration with anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 "antibodies.<br><br>
Exemplary SMAC mimetics include, e.g., peptides comprising a tetrapeptide that binds the surface groove within the BIR domain of an IAP, including tetrapeptides of the formula X1X2X3X4, wherein Xi is A, X2 is V, T, or I, X3 is P or A and X4 is F, Y, I or V or other SMAC peptides, agonists or peptidiomimetics described in PCT WO 02/26775. Other exemplary SMAC mimetics include LBP672. See, e.g.. Figure 15 and Example 54.<br>
2.	26S Proteasome Inhibitors<br>
[123]   In some embodiments, the apoptosis-inducing agent is a 26S Proteasome inhibitor. Proteasome inhibitors are agents that inhibit the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway, thereby preventing degradation of IKB and subsequent nuclear localization of IKB'S partner, NFKB. The proteasome has two functional components: the 20S core catalytic subunit and the 19S regulatory subunit. The 20S and 19S subunits form a 26S complex that degrades proteins targeted for degradation with the addition of ubiquitin. Exemplary proteasome inhibitors include, e.g., PS-341 (NSC no. 681239, also known as bortezomib) and analogs thereof (see, e.g., Adams, Cur. Opin. ChemBiol 6:493-500 (2002)). PS-341 and other proteasome inhibitors useful according to the methods of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,780,454, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[124]   Additional exemplary proteasome inhibitors include, e.g., lactacystin, PS-273 (NSC no. 681226); PS-293 (NSC no. 681227); PS-296 (NSC no. 681228); PS-303 (NSC no. 681229); PS-305 (NSC no. 681231); PS-313 (NSC no. 681234); PS-321 (NSC no. 681236); PS-334 (NSC no. 681237); PS-364 (NSC no. 681242); PS-325 (NSC no. 683086); PS-352 (NSC no. 683094); PS-383 (NSC no. 683098), YU101 (ac-hFLFL-epoxide) (see, e.g., Elofsson, et al.9 Chem. Biol 6:811-822 (1999)), MG262, MG132, MG115, PSI (proteasome inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-He-Glu(O-tert-butyl)-Ala-leucinal). Assays for identifying proteasome inhibitors are commercially available from, e.g., Discoverx (Fremont, CA).<br>
[125]   While combination of 26S proteasome inhibitors with DR4 or DR5 agonists (e.g., anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibodies of the present invention) can be an effective therapy for a wide range of hyperproliferative disorders, the combination can be particularly effective against cancer cells with defects in Box or other components of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (e.g., Bcl-xl or Bcl-2). For example, colon cancer patients frequently have tumor cells that are Bax defective. Therefore, proteasome inhibitor combined with a DR4 or DR-5 antagonist is particularly effective to treat colon cancers involving Bax or other mitochondrial apoptosis defects.<br><br>
[126]   In some embodiments, the proteasome inhibitor is a compound of formula I<br><br>

[198]   Most especially preferred are the compounds of formula I described in the Examples, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
[199]   The compounds of formula I or salts thereof are prepared in accordance with processes known. The processes preferably comprise<br>
[200]   a) reacting a dipeptide analogue of the formula n,<br><br>
[201]   wherein R3, R4 and R5 have the meanings given under formula I, with an amino acid of the formula HI,<br><br>
[202]   or a reactive derivative thereof, wherein Ri and R2 have the meanings given under formula I, functional groups present in a compound of formula II and/or HI, with the exception of the groups participating in the reaction, being protected if necessary by readily removable protecting groups, and any protecting groups present are removed, or<br><br>

[207]   and, if desired, converting a compound of formula I obtained by process a) or b) into another compound of formula I, converting an obtained free compound of formula I into a salt, converting an obtained salt of a compound of formula I into a different salt or into its free form, and/or separating a mixture of isomeric compounds of formula I into the individual isomers.<br>
[208]   The different possible stereoisomers of compounds of formula I can be prepared by using educts with the appropriate configuration. For example, compounds of formula I* or salts thereof can be prepared by<br>
[209]    a) reacting a dipeptide analogue of the formula n*,<br><br>
[210]   wherein R3, R4 and R5 have the meanings given under formula I, with an amino acid of the formula HI*,<br><br><br>
[211]   or a reactive derivative thereof, wherein Ri and R2 have the meanings given under formula I,<br>
[212]   functional groups present in a compound of formula n* and/or HI*, with the exception of the groups participating in the reaction, being protected if necessary by readily removable protecting groups, and any protecting groups present are removed, or<br>
[213]   b) for the production of a compound of the formula I* wherein Rj is arylalkylcaibonyl orheterocyclylalkylcaibonyl and the other moieties R2 to R5 have the meanings given under formula I, reacting an amino compound of the formula IV*,<br><br>

[216]   The end products of formula I may contain substituents that can also be used as protecting groups in starting materials for the preparation of other end products of formula I, e.g. in the case of R4 other than -B(OH)2. Thus, within the scope of this text, only<br><br>
a readily removable group that is not a constituent of the particular desired end product of formula I is designated a "protecting group", unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
[217]   The protection of functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their cleavage reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Third edition, Wiley, New York 1999, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Houben Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine" (Amino acids, Peptides, Proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jocheh Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate" (Chemistry of Carbohydrates: Monosacchandes and Derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
[218]   A characteristic of protecting groups is that they can be removed readily (i.e. without the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions) for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or alternatively under physiological conditions (e.g. by enzymatic cleavage).<br>
[219]   Removal of a protecting group for the -B(OH)2-group (in order to obtain a compound of the formula I wherein R4 is -B(OH)2) preferably takes place with an acid, e.g. hydrogen chloride, in an appropriate solvent, e.g. a lower alkanol, such as methanol, or a lower alkane, such as hexane, or a mixture thereof, at temperatures of 0 to 50 °C, e.g. at room temperature.<br>
[220]   At least two processes can be used to synthesize the proteasome inhibitors of formula I. In process "a", the reaction is carried out by dissolving the compounds of formulae II and EI in a suitable solvent, for example T^AT-dimethylformamide, ^AT-dimethylacetamide, W-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, methylene chloride, or a mixture of two or more such solvents, and by the addition of a suitable base, for example triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine (DDEA) or JV-methylmorpholine and a suitable coupling agent that forms a preferred reactive derivative of the carbonic acid of formula HI in situ, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCC/ HOBT); 0-(l,2-dihydro-2-oxo-l-pyridyO-W^'^'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU); O-benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\ N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU); or l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). For review of other possible coupling agents, see<br><br>
e.g. Klauser, Bodansky, Synthesis 1972,453-463. The reaction mixture is preferably stirred at a temperature of between approximately -20 and 50 °C, especially between 0 °C and room temperature, to yield a compound of formula I. The reaction is preferably carried out under an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen or argon.<br>
[221]   In process "b", the reaction is preferably carried out under conditions analogous to those described for process a).<br>
[222]   Salts of a compound of formula I with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.<br>
[223]   Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, or hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.<br>
[224] ■ Stereoisomer^ mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of one of the starting compounds or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.<br>
[225]   Compounds of the formula I wherein R4 is other than -B(OH)2 can be converted into compounds of the formula I wherein R4 is -B(OH)2 according to standard procedures, e.g. using isobutyl-borpnic acid (i-BuB(OH)2 in the presence of an acid, especially hydrohalic acid in a water/methanol/hexane mixture, at temperatures preferably ranging from 0 to 50 °C, e.g. at room temperature.<br>
[226]   In both process a) and b), for the conversion or for the synthesis of the intermediates or starting material, the solvents from which those can be selected which are suitable for the reaction in question include for example water, esters, typically lower alkyl-lower alkanoate, e.g., diethyl acetate, ethers, typically aliphatic ethers, e.g. diethylether, or cyclic ethers, e.g. tetrahydrofiiran, liquid aromatic hydrocarbons, typically benzene or toluene, alcohols, typically methanol, ethanol or 1- or 2-propanol, nitriles, typically aceto-nitrile, halogenated hydrocarbons, typically dichloromethane, acid amides, typically dimethylfonnamide, bases, typically heterocyclic nitrogen bases, e.g. pyridine, carboxylic<br><br>
acids, typically lower alkanecarboxylic acids, e.g. acetic acid, carboxylic acid anhydrides, typically lower alkane acid anhydrides, e.g. acetic anhydride, cyclic, linear, or branched hydrocarbons, typically cyclohexane, hexane, or isopentane, or mixtures of these solvents, e.g. aqueous solutions, unless otherwise stated in the description of the process. Such solvent mixtures may also be used in processing, for example through chromatography or distribution.<br>
[227]   New starting materials and/or intermediates, as well as processes for the preparation thereof, are likewise the subject of this invention. In the preferred embodiment, such starting materials are used and reaction conditions selected such as to allow the manufacture of the preferred compounds.<br>
[228]   The starting materials of formulae II - V or their precursors are known, can be prepared according to known processes, or are commercially obtainable; in particular,' they can be prepared using processes identical or in analogy to those described in the Examples.<br>

VII.        Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[315]   The antibodies and agents of the invention can be administered directly to the mammalian subject for treatment, e.g., of hyperproliferative disorders including cancer such as, but not limited to: carcinomas, gliomas, mesotheliomas, melanomas, lymphomas, leukemias, adenocarcinomas, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, glioblastoma, leukemia, lymphoma, prostate cancer, and Burkitt's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, cancer of the<br><br>
esophagus, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, cancer of the gallbladder, cancer of the small intestine, rectal cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, penile cancer, urethral cancer, testicular cancer, cervical cancer, vaginal cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, parathyroid cancer, adrenal cancer, pancreatic endocrine cancer, carcinoid cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, retinoblastomas, multiple myelomas, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (see, CANCER:PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (DeVita, V.T. et al eds 1997) for additional cancers).<br>
[316]   Administration of the compositions of the present invention is by any of the routes normally used for introducing a chemotherapeutic compound into ultimate contact with the tissue to be treated. The antibodies and agents are administered in any suitable manner, optionally with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable methods of administering such antibodies and agents are available and well known to those of skill in the art, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route.<br>
[317]   Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed. 1985)).<br>
[318]   The antibodies and agents, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations (i.e., they can be "nebulized") to be administered via inhalation. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.<br>
[319]   Formulations suitable for administration include aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, isotonic sterile solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. In the practice of this invention, compositions can be administered, for example, by orally, topically, intravenously, intraperitoneally, intravesically or intrathecally. Optionally, the compositions are administered nasally. The formulations of compounds can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials. Solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described. The modulators can also be administered as part a of<br><br>
prepared food or drug. The compounds of the present invention can also be used effectively in combination with one or more additional active agents (e.g., chemotherapeutics) depending on the desired therapy or effect.<br>
[320]   The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial response in the subject over time. The dose will be determined by the efficacy of the particular modulators employed and the condition of the subject, as well as the body weight or surface area of the area to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound or vector in a particular subject. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.<br>
[321]   The antibody agonist and the apoptosis-inducing agent can be administered together in a mixture or each can be administered separately. The antibody agent and the apoptosis inducing agent can, but need not, be administered concurrently.<br>
VIIL      Inhibitors of apoptosis<br>
[322]   As described herein, a variety of gene products either inhibit (e.g., molecules listed in the first portion of Figure 27; and UbcHIO) or promote (e.g., molecules listed in the bottom portion of Figure 27) TRAIL-induced (and anti-DR4 or anti-DR5-induced) apoptosis. Those gene products that inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be targeted with inhibitors to synergistically increase apoptosis induced by TRAIL, anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibodies. Similarly, those gene products that promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be targeted with activators to synergistically increase apoptosis induced by TRAIL, anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 antibodies.<br>
[323]   Alternatively, activators of gene products that inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis can be used to reduce apoptosis where and when it is detrimental. Similarly, inhibitors of those gene products that promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis can also be used to reduce apoptosis where and when it is detrimental. One such disorder is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) (Kwaan, H. G, Semin. Hematol, 24:71 (1987); Thompson et al, Blood, 80:1890, (1992)). Increasing TTP-associated mortality rates have been reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (Torek et al.,Am. J. Hematol 50:84,1995).<br>
[324]   Plasma from patients afflicted with TTP (including HIV*" and HIV" patients) induces apoptosis of human endothelial cells of dermal microvascular origin, but not large vessel origin (Laurence et al, Blood, 87:3245 (1996)). Plasma of TTP patients thus is thought to contain one or more factors that directly or indirectly induce apoptosis. As<br><br>
described in PCT application WO 97/01633 (hereby incorporated by reference), TRAIL is present in the serum of TTP patients, and may play a role in inducing apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells.<br>
[325]   Another thrombotic microangiopathy is hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) (Moake, J. L., Lancet, 343:393 (1994); Melnyk etal,Arch. Intern. Med. 155:2077, (1995)). One embodiment of the invention is directed to treat the condition that is often referred to as "adult HUS" (even though it can strike children as well). A disorder known as childhood/diarrhea-associated HUS differs in etiology from adult HUS.<br>
[326]   Other conditions characterized by clotting of small blood vessels. Such conditions include but are not limited to the following: Cardiac problems seen in about 5-10% of pediatric AIDS patients are believed to involve clotting of small blood vessels. Breakdown of the microvasculature in the heart has been reported in multiple sclerosis patients. As a further example, treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is contemplated.<br>
DC.	Predicting efficacy of anti-cancer treatments with anti-DR5 agonists<br>
[327]   The inventors have discovered that expression of the gene product Myc is necessary but not sufficient for efficacy of anti-DR5 antibodies to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Accordingly, expression of Myc in tumor cells (e.g., from a biopsy) provides a marker for identifying cells (and therefore subjects) that are unlikely to respond to DR5-targeted therapies. Specifically, if tumor cells express less Myc than wildtype cells, it is less likely that DR5-targeted therapy will be effective than if Myc is expressed at or above wildtype expression levels. Thus, the present invention provides methods of determining the efficacy of anti-DR5 agonist antibody-based therapies by obtaining a sample of tumor cells from a subject and detecting expression levels of Myc in the cells, wherein a lower than wild type expression level of Myc indicates that the therapies will have reduced or no efficacy in killing tumor cells.<br><br>

[464]   Exemplary IC50 values determined according to the test described<br>
above for compounds of formula I are given below (Table 1).<br><br><br><br>
Example 54:<br>
[465]   As part of our assay development for the anti-DR5 screen, we cloned, expressed and purified Trail ligand and tested it on Jurkat cells to determine if we could kill cells with the ligand. The assay comprised Alamar Blue, a redox dye that fluoresces when living cells reduce the dye. When cells are killed by apoptosis, the resulting environment is oxidizing and the dye is not reduced and no fluorescence can be detected. As illustrated in Figure 1, TRAIL induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells.<br>
[466]   A screen for antibody agonists was performed. Mice were immunized with the DR5 receptor and B cells were fused to myelomas. The resulting hybridomas were arrayed into 384 well plates and following several days of growth, 20 pi of supernatant and cross-linking antibody was added to wells containing Jurkat cells. Twenty-four hours later alamar blue dye was added and 24 hours later the plate was read using an Acquest. Several positive wells containing positively reacting antibodies were identified.<br>
[467]   The specificity of the positive antibodies was tested. Three hybridomas that gave a positive signal in the assay were sub-cloned, expanded and purified. Twenty-one TNF receptors were cloned, expressed and purified. Receptors were coated on wells and the three antibodies were subjected to ELISA analysis. The results show that the antibodies were only reactive with DR5, and thus, were very specific. See, Figure 2.<br>
[468]   Figure 3 displays a dose response analysis. The 3 antibody agonists show different dose responses relative to Jurkat cell killing. Antibody A (ATCC Deposit No.<br>
	) had the best potency and thus was chosen for further studies, hngenex-257 is a DR5<br>
specific antibody that has no functional activity.<br>
[469]   Caspase 3 activation was determined. To determine if the antibody was killing the cells by apoptosis and not by some indirect or non-specific mechanism, we ran Caspase-3 activity assays. Antibody or ligand was mixed with cells at various concentrations and cell extracts were generated from the treated cells. A fluorescent substrate was added to the lysate, which could be used to test for active caspase 3, an indicator of<br><br>
apoptosis. The antibody stimulated apoptosis in a similar fashion to the ligand. Figure 4 displays the results.<br>
[470]   The effects of DR5 antibody on colon and melanoma cell lines was determined. Figure 5 shows dose response curves against various attached tumor cell lines. All of the cell lines are sensitive to the DR5 apoptosis inducing antibodies except the HCT 116 bax/bax- cell line, which is incapable of carrying out apoptosis.<br>
[471] Figure 6 displays the same experiment carried out on various breast cancer cell lines. T47D and ZR-75-1 are both resistant to the tumoricidal activity of DR5, whereas, MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231 are sensitive.<br>
[472]   Figure 7 shows that tumor cells are sensitive to the action of the antibody but normal cells, human lung fibroblasts (HLF) and human umbilical vein epithehal cells (HUVEC) were resistant as indicated by their lack of a dose response.<br>
[473]   To further demonstrate the point that normal cells are not killed by the antibody, human lung fibroblasts, human mammary epithelial cells and normal primary human hepatocytes were assayed for caspase 3 activity following treatment with the DR5 antibody. None of the normal cells showed activity whereas, DOHH2 follicular lymphoma and Jurkat cells showed Caspase activation associated with apoptosis. See, Figure 8.<br>
[474] In addition, CaOV3, an ovarian cancer cell line, is wiped out by the antibody, whereas, the normal HLF's and HMEC's are completely unaffected by the DR5 antibody.<br>
[475]   In vivo efficacy of the antibodies was tested. Ten mice were injected with 5xl06 colo 205 (colon tumor cells) subcutaneously at day 0. Treatment with the DR5 antibody (400 jig ) was started on day 11. After 2 injections with 400 \ig of DR5 the 5 treated animals showed no evidence of tumor whereas the 5 mice given PBS all had large tumors. Thus the antibody appears to be effective in vivo.<br>
[476]   The study was continued through Day 32. The untreated mice had large tumors or died. The treated mice showed no disease. The experiment was terminated at day 50. All of the untreated were dead. None of the treated showed any relapse at day 50. Figure 9 displays the Colo 205 efficacy study shown graphically. The arrows refer to the treatment days.<br>
[477]   The previous experiment represents a single dose study. To determine the potency of the antibody, we carried out a large dose response study. The group size was expanded to 8 mice per group and 50, 200, and 400 \xg doses were given as described in the<br><br>
previous single dose study. The results indicate that the antibody is effective at low (e.g., 50 |ig) doses. See, Figure 10.<br>
[478]   A smaller dose response study on a new tumor model, the melanoma cell line A2058, was also performed. This cell line was more resistant to the antibody in vitro. The group size was 2 mice. The treated mice (400 jag) shows in vivo tumoricidal activity, whereas the mice treated with 20 ng or PBS estabhshed large tumors. See, Figure 11.<br>
[479]   Since different cell lines show various degrees of sensitivity to the DR5 antibody, we explored the development of small molecule synergists that sensitize resistant or pertly resistant cell lines to the action of the antibody. We approached this problem by analyzing apoptotic pathways, determining where apoptosis could potentially be blocked, and what types of small molecule synergists could be pro-apoptotic in nature.<br>
[480]   Figure 12 depicts the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways for apoptosis. The key points are that tumor cells over-express inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and Bcl2 that blocks the release of key pro-apoptotic proteins (cyto C and SMAC) from the mitochondria. The blocks established by these proteins can be overcome by the addition of SMAC. SMAC inhibits the IAPs. A SMAC mimetic called LB 672 was tested for its possible synergstic effect to sensitize tumor cells to the action of the DR5 agonist.<br>
[481]   Figure 13 shows the effect of the SMAC mimetic on A2058 melanoma cells. Previously, we showed that these cells are partially sensitive to the antibody. This graph shows that cell treated with SMAC and DR5 antibody are completely ablated while the 672 compound has virtually no activity on its own.<br>
[482]   Figure 14 displays dose response graphs showing the effects of different concentrations of SMAC on A2058 melanoma cells. Again, these tumor cells are partially resistant, but are sensitized to low levels of SMAC (50-100 nM). However, more importantly, neither HMEC or HLF cells are sensitized by the SMAC mimetic LB672.<br>
[483]   Figure 15 shows the pharmakokinetic properties of SMAC.<br>
[484]   A second synergist strategy was employed to test the use of proteasome inhibitors as DR4/DR5 synergists. As shown in Figure 16, proteasome inhibitors prevent the proteasome from degrading IKB. This in turn prevents the release of NFKB. NFKB is known to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of BCL2, IAPS, and other anti-apoptotic factors.<br><br>
[485]     We first tested whether proteasome inhibitors would sensitize tumor cells to DR5 by the addition of MG132, a commercially available weak proteasome inhibitor. Figure 17 shows that at reasonably high concentrations, MG 132 sensitized resistant SW 480 colon cells to the action of the antibody.<br>
[486]   We also obtained several potent proteasome inhibitors. The compounds that showed the best effects were the boronates. The maximal tolerated doses demonstrate that these compounds are relatively toxic, and thus there is a narrow window between toxicity and tumoricidal efficacy in vivo. See, Figure 18.<br>
[487]   The proteasome inhibitors sensitized A2058-LUC to the DR5 antibodies. See, Figure 19. The proteasome inhibitors sensitized the resistant hepatoma cell line HUH-7 to the antibodies as well. See, Figure 20. However, neither compound had an effect on normal HMEC cells. Furthermore, these cells were not sensitized to the action of the antibody. See, Figure 21.<br>
[488]   Variable regions from the DR5 mouse antibody A were cloned out and inserted into an SP20 Expression system. These vectors encode Human IgG 1 Fc. The resulting human chimera is 80% human and 20% mouse. The nucleic acid sequences of the heavy and light chain variable regions are displayed in Figure 22. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain variable region is displayed in Figure 24 or Figure 35 and the amino acid sequence of the light chain variable region is displayed in Figure 25 or Figure 35. The chimera was expressed in SP2/0 cells at 20 pg/cell/day. The resulting human chimeric antibody was cross-linked with a goat anti-human Fc and tested for functional activity. The chimeric had functional tumoricidal activity equivalent to the mouse antibody. See, Figure 21.<br>
Example 55:<br>
[489]   A library of siRNA molecules was transfected into cells, the cells were contacted with TRAIL and the cells were screened for altered viability compared to the absence of TRAIL. Cells with altered viability were then used to identify the particular siRNA transfected into the cell, thereby determining the gene inhibited by the siRNA. See, Figures 26 and 27.<br>
[490]   Figure 28 illustrates gene products corresponding to siRNAs that were selected based on the screen. Gene products whose inhibition with siRNAs leads to a low TRAIL (+/-) ratio are inhibitors of TRAIL-induced apoptosis.<br><br>
[491]   Table 1 provides additional infonnation, including Genbank accession numbers, for the gene products identified in Figure 28.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 56:<br>
[492]   siRNAs were identified that specifically inhibit expression of Gsk3a or GSK3P, thereby allowing us to determine the effect of either gene product on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As illustrated in Figure 29, inhibition of Gsk3ct, but not Gsk3p, reduces Caspase activity in cells compared to controls. Thus, Gsk3a is an activator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Similarly, two other gene products SRP72 and FU32312, were also identified as activators of apoptosis.<br>
[493]   The relationship of various components identified herein is provided in Figure 30. The figure illustrates the relation and effect (e.g., apoptosis activator or inhibitor) of various components of the TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway.<br>
Example 57:<br>
[494]   A siRNA library targeting 510 genes arrayed in 384 well format was transfected into Hela cells. Cells were incubated for 48 hours to allow target decay, and treated with or without TRAIL. Viability was measured 20 hours after TRAIL treatment using alamar blue. A sensitivity ratio was determined for each siRNA for comparison with a total of 60 values obtained with control siRNAs. Hela cells treated with TRAIL ligand resulted in ~ 40% reduction in viability as measured by MTT assays in control wells. siRNAs that significantly inhibited or enhanced cells death were identified. See, Tables 2 and 3, respectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[495]   Several siRNAs identified in the screen that enhanced cell death as measured by viability assays were tested for their ability to enhance caspase activation by DR5 agonistic antibodies. DR5 antibody was titrated to produce a minimal amount of caspase activation as measured by fluorogenic peptides (DEVD-afc). The siRNAs directed against nsrna, nsurf, PAK1, stkl2, Askl and JIK were transfected into Hela cells and then treated withDR5 antibodies. Control siRNA (nsrna) had little effect whereas the identified siRNAs significantly enhanced caspase activity.<br>
[496]   Several additional (distinct from those in the screen) siRNAs directed towards PAK1 were designed and tested for their effect on viability in the presence or absence of DR5 antibody. The siRNA included:<br>
siPAKl-0	AGAGCTGCTACAGCATCAA<br>
siP AK1 -1	GACAUCC AAC AGCC AGAAA<br>
siPAKl -2	GAGAAAGAGCGGCC AGAGA<br>
hPAKl -6	UACCAGCACUAUGAUUGGA<br>
siP AK1 -7       UCUGUAUAC ACACGGUCUG<br>
[497]   PAK1-1 and PAK1-2 strongly reduced viability (MTT assay) in the<br>
colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 bax +/- at both 24 and 48 hours.<br>
[498]   HCT116 bax -/- cells have both copies of bax deleted, rendering these cells very resistant to chemotherapeutic treatment, including to TRAIL1 and DR5 antibodies. However PAK1 siRNAs remained effective at reducing viability. These same results were also observed in colon carcinoma DLD1 cells.<br>
[499]   To determine whether silencing or inhibition of PAK1 was toxic to normal cells, we tested PAK1 siRNAs on a primary ovarian epithelial cell line IOSE80. The results demonstrated that siRNAs directed against PAK1 do not reduce viability of normal cells. Thus, PAK1 and the other gene products.<br>
[500]   In addition, siPAKl does not significantly reduce viability in the primary ("normal") epithelial cell line HMEC, whereas it strongly enhances DR5 and DR4 induced reduction of viability in the colon carcinoma cell line HCT15.<br><br>
Example 58    Synergistic effect of UbcHlO antagonist and anti-DR5 antibody<br>
[501]   This example describes synergistic effect of human ubiquitin conjugase UbcHlO (UBE2C) antagonist and anti-DR5 antibody in inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. UbcHlO plays an essential role in cell cycle regulation. Employing global analysis of gene expression and immunohistochemistry, the present inventors found that UbcHlO is significantly over-expressed in carcinomas of multiple anatomic sites, notably breast, stomach/esophagus, colorectum, lung and ovary. The data indicate that UbcHlO plays an important role in tumor development. Therapeutic potential of inhibiting UbcHlO in the treatment of cancers was then examined.<br>
[502]   Reduction of cell growth by RNAi-mediated silencing of UbcHl 0 expression. We first investigated the consequences of gene silencing in tumor cells with high UbcHlO levels, we designed sequences for three different and non-overlapping small interfering RNAs (siRNA) (UbcH10-495, UbcH10-378, UbcH10-412). Each siRNAs was initially tested in 2 cell lines, T3M4 (derived from a pancreatic carcinoma) and DLD-1 (derived from colorectal carcinoma). All three of the siRNAs targeted to UbcHlO, but not control siRNA, resulted in efficient diminution of the UbcHlO protein, which correlated with their ability to suppress cell growth. These data underscore the specificity of the UbcHlO siRNAs and indicate that the results are not due to "off-target" effects. Because the UbcHlO-APC complex controls cyclin Bl degradation, we also examined the levels of cyclin Bl by Western blot analysis following UbcHlO silencing. Our results revealed an inverse correlation between the levels of UbcHlO protein in cells treated with siUbcHIO and the levels of cyclin Bl. Further, cell cycle analysis following siUbcHIO treatment showed arrest in the M-phase (data not shown), consistent with disclosure in the art. Microscopically, down-regulation of UbcHlO did not induce any changes in cell morphology indicative of apoptosis, such as cell rounding, detachment, nuclear condensation or production of apoptotic bodies. Moreover, siUbcHIO treatment did not result in proteolytic processing of the two executioner caspases, caspase-3 and -7 (14), as measured by Western blot analysis and fluorescent caspase activity assays.<br>
[503]   Down-regulating UbcHlO is additive to effects of standard chemotherapeutic drugs: UbcHlO is highly over-expressed in human cancers compared to most normal tissues. To determine therapeutic potential of targeting UbcHlO, we surveyed several known chemotherapeutic and a molecularly targeted agent for potential tumor-specific effects subsequent to UbcHlO silencing. For these studies, we employed the<br><br>
microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel, the spindle inhibitor, vinblastine, the DNA alkylation agent, mitomycin c, and a functionally agonistic antibody capable of triggering DR5/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, to cover a spectrum of agents with different mechanisms of action. Two pancreatic cancer cell lines, T3M4 and Panc-1, and an androgen-independent prostate carcinoma cell line, CWR-RV1, were treated with siUbcHIO for 48 hours followed by incubation with vinblastine, paclitaxel, mitomycin c, and anti-DR5 for an additional 24 hours. The results indicate that co-treatment with mitotic poisons and DNA-damaging drugs following UbcHIO silencing produced an additive reduction in cell viability in a number of tumor cell lines that we tested (Fig. 31). Initial treatment of cancer cells for 48 hours with siUbcHIO reduced the amount of viable cells by &gt;50%, which were be further decreased by the addition of cytotoxic agents for an additional 24 hours. Following normalization for the numbers of UbcHlO-silenced cells, the Ic90or Icso concentrations were identical, indicating an additive effect. All three independent siRNAs targeted to UbcHIO exhibited similar effects with TRAIL in T3M4 and Panc-1 cells. The data are the mean of triplicates and similar results were obtained in four independent experiments.<br>
[504]   Down-regulating UbcHIO sensitizes cells to TRAIL/DR5-mediated cell killing: Primary human fibroblasts (BJ), human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), and T3M4 cells were sequentially treated with siUbcHIO (siUbcH 10-495) for 48 hours followed by agonistic anti-DR5 antibodies (500 ng/ml) for an additional 6 hours. Fluorescent (FITC)-labeled control siRNAs were used to ensure equal transfection efficacy of all cell lines including BJ and HMEC cells. Cells were analyzed by microscopy. The results were shown in Figures 31 and 32. As illustrated in the figures, pre-treatment of T3M4 and Panc-1 cells with siUbcHIO significantly increased the apoptosis induced by anti-DR5 antibodies compared to siRNA or anti-DR5 treatment alone, whereas it had a negligible effect in CWR-RV1 cells, which are TRAIL insensitive (Fig. 31).   The data indicated that incubation of cancer cell lines, most notably, T3M4, with anti-DR5 antibody subsequent to siUbcHIO treatment exhibited dramatically enhanced apoptosis. This was not seen in primary human skin fibroblasts (BJ) or mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) (Figs. 31 and 32). This observation seems to reflect a general phenomenon, since other TRAIL resistant tumor cell lines as well as normal cells were not made sensitive to TRAIL by down-regulation of UbcHIO.<br><br>
Example 59    Synergy of anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 agonists and proteasome inhibitors against Bax-defective tumor cells.<br>
[505]   Defects in the DNA repair system (mismatch repair (MMR)) lead to genetic instability because replication errors are not corrected. This type of genetic instability is a key event in the malignant progression of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) and a subset of sporadic colon cancers and mutation rates are particularly high at short repetitive sequences, such as those contained in the TGFbetaRII and BAX genes. Thus, Bax loss in these tumors provides a severe survival advantage to natural and chemotherapeutic induction of apoptosis,<br>
[506]   Figure 34 illustrates that loss of Bax confers resistance to TRAIL ligand. However, proteasome inhibition restores sensitivity to TRAIL. Proteasome inhibition by peptidyl-based inhibitors MG-132 or MG262 or Lactacystin, a natural compound, completely restores sensitivity to TRAIL in cells deficient in Bax. See, Figure 34.<br>
[507]   Proteasome inhibitors circumvent defects in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Depending on the cell type, active caspase-8 can lead directly to the activation of downstream effector caspases like caspase-3 (so called type-I-cells). In type-II-cells (most cells including HCT116), the two prototypical pathways, extrinsic (death-receptor) and intrinsic (mitochondrial), are interconnected by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the pro-apoptotic bcl-2 family member Bid, which promotes the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and SMAC. Once released into the cytoplasm, cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 forming the "apoptosome", which leads to the activation of pro-caspase-9 and subsequent activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3. Cytosolic SMAC, on the other hand, binds to members of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein family and thereby prevents IAP inhibition of caspase-3 and -9.<br>
[508]   These events were readily observed by western blot analysis in TRAEL-treated Bax+/- cells (SMAC and cytochrome-c release not shown). See, Figure 34. Likewise, in Bax -/- cells treated with TRAIL (T), caspase-8 processing and Bid processing occur as normal, however, caspase-9 and complete caspase-3 processing and maturation do not (lanes 2, 3 and 4). This is as expected since Bax loss prevents events downstream of Bid cleavage because the resulting pro-apoptotic fragment of Bid requires Bax for these events. TRAIL (T) + MG-262 (M) completely restores the mitochondrial pathway resulting in caspase-9 and caspase-3 processing and activation leading to cell death. MG-262 (M) on its own has no effect on this proteolytic cascade. These and other data indicate that proteasome<br><br>
inhibition is useful in resensitizing tumor cells containing defects in the mitochondrial<br>
apoptosis pathway to apoptosis induced by TRAIL receptor agonists.<br>
