				<td>This invention relates to an apparatus for controlling flow of glass through a discharge orifice.<br>
In the manufacture of glass articles  it is common to provide a glass forehearth and multiple orifices which are controlled by reciprocable needles or plungers in order to provide the necessary uniform weight of gobs. Plural needles and orifices are utilized in order to maximize glass production.<br>
Typical systems are shown in United States patents 1,529,928, 1,792,932, 1,926,764, 3,711,266,4,478,681,4,554,000,4,581,054 and 4,793,849.<br>
In such systems it is common to manually adjust each plunger. Furthermore in such systems, the operating mechanisms are often in overlying relationship to the plungers and therefore are subject to extreme heat conditions and contaminants of oil or metal that can jeopardize the purity of the molten glass.<br>
Accordingly among the objectives of the present invention are to provide a<br>
multiple orifice glass system wherein   <br><br>
each plunger is individually mounted in association with its respective servo-motor; wherein each servo control can be automatically controlled to produce an accurate weight gob during operation; wherein the actuating servo mechanisms are mounted on the side of the forehearth and cannot contaminate the glass and are protected from the heat of the glass; wherein the individual weight of the plunger and support arms is counterbalanced by an air spring; and wherein a single plunger can be consulted, operated and controlled individually.<br>
In accordance with the invention a multiple orifice glass feed system for use with a glass forehearth including a plurality of closely spaced plungers, each of which is individually supported independently of the other. Each plunger includes a servo controlled linear actuator and an arm extending between each plunger and its respective servo-motor. Each servo-motor has an axis parallel to the axis of the plungers. An air spring is associated with each plunger for balancing the weight of each plunger and its respective arm. The center lines of the plungers lie generally in a plane. Unlike the prior commercial practices which confines the arms to a straight line between the orifice and the motivator or actuator, at least some of the arms of the present invention take circuitous routes incorporating parallel and angular portions. A feedback system is provided to monitor the position of each individual needle independently of the other at all times and make corrections to the actual position of the needle if desired.<br><br>
In one form the center lines of the major portions of the arms are parallel to the plane of the plungers. In another form the center lines of the major portions of the arms are perpendicular to the plane of the plungers. Although the system is especially applicable to a plurality of plungers and is shown as applied to four plungers, it is applicable to a lesser number of plungers or a single plunger.<br>
In another form, each servo-motor is part of a module and moves a movable frame for vertical movement on spaced vertical shafts. Each movable frame supports a plunger arm. The modules are mounted in side by side relationship with one another.<br>
Each assembly of an arm and servo controlled linear actuator is preferably provided in an elongated rectangular module such that a plurality of modules can be provided in closely spaced relationship at one side of a forehearth.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for controlling flow of glass through a discharge orifice, which comprises a module including: a first frame for disposition in fixed position adjacent to the orifice, a second frame movably mounted on said first frame, with said first frame including means for guiding motion of said second frame in a vertical direction, a servo motor mounted on said first frame, and a lead screw extending from said servo-motor and coupled by a nut to said second frame; a cabinet surrounding and enclosing said module, said cabinet having a vertical wall for disposition adjacent to said orifice and a elongated opening in said wall; a heat shield carried by said second frame of said module interiorly adjacent to said vertical wall covering said vertically elongated opening to reduce entry of heat into said cabinet through said opening; a plunger arm cantilevered from said second frame for disposition over the orifice; and means on a free end of said plunger arm for suspending a plunger from said arm.<br><br>

Description<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1-3, in accordance with the invention, the glass plunger system 10 embodying the invention is associated with a bowl 11 of a forehearth and is intended to support a plurality of plungers or needles 12 that function in connection with orifices 13 to control the flow of glass out of the orifices so that when associated shears, not shown, are used the size and weight of the gobs is consistent.<br>
In accordance with the invention, each plunger 12 is supported by a horizontal arm 15 that is connected to the plunger 16 of a servo-motor controlled mechanism 17. Each arm further includes an air spring 18 associated with its respective arm 15 for balancing the weight of each plunger and its respective arm. The center lines of the plungers lie generally in a first plane. The arms 15 have the major portions thereof generally parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the plungers (FIG. 3). A feedback system is provided to monitor the position of each individual needle independently of the other at all times and make corrections to the actual position of the needle if iesired.<br>
The arms 15 are constructed and arranged in close &gt;roximity so that a minimum of space is utilized and so that he operating mechanisms are in lateral but close proximity to he bowl of the glass. As shown in FIG. 2, one arm 15 is traight and the other three arms are L-shaped, one arm 15 being n one side of straight arm 15 and the other two arms 15 being :i the other side of straight arm 15. In the form shown in FIG.<br><br>
5, all the L-shaped arms are on one side of the straight arm. In both forms, the configuration and size of the L-shaped arms are such that the arms are substantially equidistance from one another throughout their lengths.<br>
In the form shown in FIG. 2, the arms have their free ends extending at a right angle with the plungers attached thereto with the center lines of the plungers 12 lie in a plane. In the form shown in FIG. 5, the ends of the arms are curved to provide the center lines of the plungers 12 in a single plane. In the form shown in FIG. 6, the arms are entirely straight and the center of the plungers are in a plane that is parallel to the plane containing the servo-motors axes.<br>
Referring  to FIG.  3,  the  servo-motor  assembly<br>
comprises a welded drive housing 30 and includes a top bearing<br>
collar 31 an intermediate bearing collar 32 and lower bearing<br>
collar 33.  A servo drive shaft 34 is rotatably mounted in the<br>
::ollar 33 by a duplex bearing 35 held in position by retaining<br>
lut 36.  A welded drive post assembly 40 is mounted within the<br>
lousing 30 and supports a planetary roller nut 41.  The drive<br>
ihaft supports a lead screw 42 that is associated with the servo<br>
ut 41.  A coupling 43 connects the shaft 34 to the shaft of<br>
he servo actuator 45. Coupling 43 is preferably of the keyless<br>
ushing type which provide a positive lock between servo actuator<br>
haft 45 and drive shaft 34. The keyless bushing allows us the<br>
se of the smallest practical shaft diameter 34.  The reduced<br>
laft inertia reduces the motor load allowing us to use the<br>
itest art of the industry motors 17.  Such s f,r.Mr^i4"~ ;-<br><br>
manufactured and sold by Fenner Mannheim, 311 West Stiegel Street, Mannheim, Pennsylvania under the trademark Trantorque. Each air cylinder 18 that performs the function of an air spring is provided in close relationship to its respective servo-motor assembly and includes a cylinder housing 50 that has a base ring 51, a cylinder housing 52, a jaun nut 53 and an upper cylinder weldment 54. An air spring column 55 extends between the shaft of an air spring and a respective arm.<br>
The multiple orifice plunger control system is made<br>
up of one to four separate mechanical systems, depending on the<br>
number of plungers to move the needles, depending on the number<br>
of needles that are present (1-4).  Since each needle is a<br>
nechanicaily independent system, a separate motion control unit<br>
lust be provided for each unit. Referring to FIG. 7, this unit<br>
ronsists of the motion controller, amplifier/driver, servo<br>
Lctuator (which in this case, is an AC servo-motor), and a<br>
eedback device (resolver) inside the motor housing.  At this<br>
evei each control system is completely independent.<br>
The feedback device is mounted on the back of the<br>
ervo-motor and serves a dual purpose.  It provides position<br>
nformation to the motion controller which is used to determine<br>
3th the motor rotor position and the position of the plunger.<br>
The rotor position is needed for communication of the<br>
)tor since it is an AC servo-motor.  The position of the<br>
•ungers, is derived from the resolver, and is a relative offset<br>
cm a fixed reference.<br><br>
The fixed reference is the end of travel of the lea,d screw in the extended position.<br>
The amplifier/driver is simply a power amplifier. It converts the torque command inputs to the appropriate voltage and power level for the AC servo-motor connected to it.<br>
The motion controller has in its memory a motion profile, generated by the supervisor, that dictates where the particular needle mechanism should be in relationship to the master clock and reset signals. The actual position of the mechanics is determined from the feedback device. The motion controller uses both the actual position, the commanded (profile) position and the rotor position to generate the torque commands that go to the cimplifier. The absolute torque command is calculated as a function of the actual and commanded positions. The torque commands that are sent to the amplifier are in a commutated form for phase A and B. The amplitude of the absolute torque command for motor phases A and B is adjusted based on the motor rotor position. The torque command for phase C is calculated in the amplifier, it is the sum of the torque command of A and B.<br>
The supervisor calculates the motion profile for each of the motion controllers based on input from the user. The profile is a position-to-position relationship between a master rlock and the desired position of each needle. The same profile Ls normally used for each needle, but a unique profile for each leedle is possible if the situation demands it. The needles ire normally synchronized to Qperate at the same time, reaching<br><br>
the extremes of their motion at the same point in time. The vertical distance is normally the same also. Because of glass flow differences between the orifices, the needle typically operates at different elevations as shown in FIG. 8. This difference in height is used to balance the weight of the gobs produced by the individual orifices. The height adjustment is controlled by the supervisor. If a" change in the height relationship between the needles is commanded, by either operator input or from an automatic gob weight control system, the motion profile for the effected needle or needles is recalculated by the supervisor. The profile is then written into the memory of the motion controller. The supervisor is then responsible for synchronizing the change to the new profile so that all the effected motion controllers switch at the same time without a iisruption of production.<br>
It can thus be seen that there has been provided a<br>
multiple  orifice  glass  system  wherein  each  plunger  is<br>
.ndividually mounted in association with its respective servo-<br>
lotor; wherein each servo control can be automatically controlled<br>
o produce an accurate weight gob during operation; wherein the<br>
ctuating servo mechanisms are mounted on the side of the<br>
orehearth and cannot contaminate the glass and are protected<br>
rora the heat of the glass; wherein the individual weight of<br>
le plunger and support arms is counterbalanced by an air spring;<br>
id wherein a single plunger can be consulted, operated and<br>
jntrolled individually.<br><br>
In the modified forms of the invention shown in FIGS. 9-2 3, the servo-motors are part of compact modules 60 which are mounted in closely spaced side by side relation adjacent the forehearth. Each module 60 supports a horizontal plunger arm 62 and a plunger or needle P.<br>
In the form shown in FIG. 9, the plane of the vertical center lines of the plungers is parallel to the axis of the forehearth F.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 10-17, each module 60 consists of a fixed frame 64 (FIG. 11) that includes a rectangular bottom plate 66, a rectangular top plate 68 and spaced vertical uprights 70, 71 connected to the plates 66, 68 by bolts. A first shaft 72 extends between the plates 66, 68 and has its ends extending into recesses 74, 76. A second shaft 78 comprises a cylindrical bearing portion 78a and an integral elongated portion 79 along the cylindrical portion 78a which is bolted to the uprights 71. Shaft 78 extends upwardly from bottom plate 66.<br>
A movable frame 82 is supported for vertical movement<br>
on the shafts 72, 78 and consists of a spaced vertical frame<br>
members 84 (FIGS. 13, 15), each of which includes upwardly<br>
extending frame extensions 86 and downwardly extending frame<br>
extensions 87 at one end adjacent the plunger arm 62. Frame<br>
extension 86, 87 support vertically spaced bearings 110 (FIG.<br>
12) for shaft 72. Transverse bars 89 at the other end of frame<br>
82 extend between the frame members 84 and support a bearing 90<br>
for shaft 78. A servo-motor 92 is preferably formed with<br>
vertical fins 94 (FIG. 11) on its housino to mavim-i^«	1 .• - -<br><br>
v^j. une motor during operation where the mechanism is exposed to the high heat of the forehearth. The servo-motor 92 (FIG. 11) includes an output shaft 96 that extends through a brake 98 through upper plate 68 between the uprights 70 to a coupling 100 (FIG. 12) that is connected to a vertical lead screw 102. The upper end of the lead screw 102 is rotatably supported by a bearing 101 that, in turn, is supported by a bearing housing 103 fixed between uprights 70, 71. The lower end of the vertical lead screw 102, extends through a planetary helical roller nut 104. The nut 104 is mounted on plates 106, 108 between side plates frame members 84 (FIG. 13) such that when the lead screw 102 is rotated the nut 104 is translated vertically (FIG. 15) and moves the frame 82 (FIGS. 13, 15) consisting of member 84, 86, 87 and plunger arm 62 vertically.<br>
Shaft 72 extends through the bearings 110 and thus<br>
|Jissists in vertically guiding the movable frame 82 and also<br>
ppunteracts the weight of the plunger arm 62 and plunger P.  A<br>
bearing 90 is mounted at the other end of the movable frame 82<br>
assists in the guiding of the vertical movement of the frame 82<br>
IS well as counterbalancing the forces due to weight of the<br>
ilunger P and plunger arm 62. An adjustable stop 116 is provided<br>
in the lower plate 66 and functions as a stop for the nut 104 in<br>
he event the movable frame 82 is moved downwardly to a position<br>
hich might damage the forehearth F.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, a manifold 118 with associated )ses as provided for supplying lubricant to the bearings 90, 1, 110 and ball roller nut 104, through line 120.<br><br>
Referring to FIGS. 11a and 13-15 a coupling 118 which is rectangular in cross section is mounted between the frame members 84 and telescopically receives a plunger arm 62. As shown in FIGS. 14, 14A, the plunger arm 62 is pivoted to the coupling 118 by a bolt 121 such that the plunger 62 can be tilted upwardly out of the way for service on the forehearth F. An adjustable stop 122 is provided on a plate 66 for adjusting .horizontal position of the plunger arm to ensure proper vertical movement of the plunger P. The plunger P is preferably coupled to the plunger arm 62 by quick release lock 126.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 11, 18, 19, a shield housing or cabinet 150 is preferably provided around the modules 60 to protect the modules 60 from the heat of the forehearth in a manner in which the arms 62 extends outwardly from the cabinet. The cabinet 150 includes a frame 151 on which side walls 152, 154, end walls 156, 158 and top and bottom walls 160, 162 are removable. The end wall 156 has vertically elongated openings 164 through which the arms 62 extend.<br>
A heat shield 166 is provided forwardly on each module 60 and moves with the module 60 as the movable frame 82 and associated arm 62 is moved up and down and is spring loaded by springs 168 on a fixed plate 170 for sealing engagement with the opening of wall 156 in order to protect the modules 60 from the high heat of the glass and the forehearth.<br>
In operation the servo-motor 92 is actuated to move its respected plunger P.  Each module 60 is independent of the<br><br>
other as in the previous form of the invention and is controlled individually as in the previous form of the invention.<br>
In the arrangement shown in FIG. 9, the vertical axes of the plungers lie on a plane at a right angle to the axis of the forehearth F. The plunger arms 62a, 62b and 62c each have straight and parallel end portions. The center module 60 has the entire arm 62b straight while the arms 62a and 62c have the major central portions at a small angle to the arm 62b such as to bring the plungers thereon into the vertical plane previously described.<br>
In another arrangement as shown in FIG. 20 the plane of the plungers, that is the plane containing the vertical axes of the plungers is perpendicular of the axis of the forehearth F. In order to achieve such an arrangement, the center plunger arm 62e is straight and the outer arms 62d and 62f have their central major portions at a small angle to the straight arm 62e and have their end portions which are connected to the plungers at an obtuse angle to the central portions in order to bring the plungers into the single plane.<br>
The arrangement shown in FIG. 21 is identical with that shown in FIG. 9 except that four plungers are shown in a single plane. In order to achieve this arrangement the additional plunger arm 62g of the fourth module 60 has an end portion that is straight and coupled to the fourth module 60. Plunger arm 62g has a central portion that is at a greater angle than arms 62d and 62f to the straight end portion which is connected to<br><br>
the fourth module. The other end of arm 62g angled to present the fourth plunger into the desired position.<br>
In the form shown in FIG. 22, two plungers are provided by respective module 60. Each plunger arm 62h, 62i has straight end portions and angled major central portions such that the plane containing the vertical axes of the plungers is parallel to the axis of forehearth F.<br>
In the form shown in FIG. 23, the plane defined by the axes of the plungers is at a right angle to the axis of the forehearth. In order to achieve this that the plunger arms 62j, 621t have straight portions connected to the module 60, major central portions inclined to the ends at the one end and end portions connected to the plungers which are at a greater angle to the central portions angled at the other end.<br>
It can be seen that in each of the forms shown in FIGS, 9-23, the modules are rectangular as viewed in plan view and have a length several times the width so that the modules are very compacted and occupy minimal space. As a result, they can be closely spaced on one side of the forehearth as shown in FIGS. 9, 20-23, thus leaving room for the tube turning mechanism, gas burners, and shear mechanisms, while at the same time permitting ambient air to cool and thereby protect the mechanisms of the modules.<br>
It can be further seen that in all the forms of the invention, at least some of the arms are circuitous as viewed in plan view between the connection to the respective plungers and the connection to respective servo controlled linear<br><br>
actuators. In other words, each circuitous arm does not lie in a straight line between the connection to the plunger and the connection to the servo controlled actuators. As a result, the use of circuitous arms and the compact configuration of the actuators as viewed in plan view enable the actuators and arms to be in closely spaced relationship in a relatively small area such that the remaining area of the forehearth will be available for the numerous mechanisms used for glass delivery.<br><br><br>
