FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to a relatively low cost audio reproduction apparatus. More particularly* the invention relates to an audio reproduction apparatus enabled to provide a stable audio signal transmission in a video audio reproduction area.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a conventional audio reproduction apparatus that includes an audio amplifier 11 having an output side 110 for outputting audio signals and an output voltage, and an impedance matching network 13 electrically coupled across the output side 110. The audio amplifier 11 includes an amplifier 111, and a transformer 112 electrically coupled to the amplifier 111 for increasing the output voltage from the audio amplifier 11. The impedance matching network 13 includes a plurality of loudspeakers 131 that are coupled electrically in series or parallel to each other.<br>
The following are some of the drawbacks of the conventional audio reproduction apparatus:<br><br>
i. For optimum power transmission, an output impedance across the output side 110 should be equal to a total impedance of the impedance matching network 13, thereby resulting in a complex impedance design for the impedance matching network 13. Furthermore, since the impedance matching network 13 has so many impedance components, attenuation of frequency response of audio frequency occurs, which results in poor audio reproduction quality.<br>
2.	When the number of the loudspeakers 131 in the impedance matching network 13 is increased, the output impedance across the output side 110 may not match the total impedance of the impedance matching network 13. Accordingly, a limited number of the loudspeakers 131 can only be incorporated in the impedance matching network 13.<br>
3.	To increase the number of the loudspeakers 131 in the impedance matching network 13, when necessary, a high power audio amplifier is installed to replace the audio amplifier 11. Such a replacement entails higher costs.<br><br>
4. Since the impedance matching network 13 has a number of impedance components, any defect in any of the plurality of impedance components results in distortion of the audio signals such that a stable audio signal transmission cannot be ensured.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It  is  therefore,  an object of the  present  invention  to propose  an  audio reproduction apparatus that  can  overcome  the drawbacks associated with the aforesaid prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According  to the present invention, an audio  reproduction apparatus comprises!<br>
a primary audio amplifier having an output side for outputting audio signals; and<br>
a  plurality  of  auxiliary  audio  amplifiers  coupled<br><br>
electrically in series to the primary audio amplifier, each of the auxiliary audio amplifiers having an input side for receiving the audio signals from the primary audio amplifier, a signal current generating device coupled electrically across the input side such that the audio signals pass through the signal current generating device, a current inducing device disposed adjacent to the signal current generating device for generating induced audio signals when the audio signals pass through the signal current generating device, an auxiliary amplifier coupled electrically to the current inducing device for amplifying and outputting the induced audio signals generated thereby, and a loudspeaker coupled electrically to the auxiliary amplifier for reproducing the induced audio signals amplified by the auxiliary amplifier.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic electrical circuit diagram of a conventional audio reproduction apparatus;<br>
Figure 2 is a fragmentary schematic electrical circuit diagram of the first preferred embodiment of an audio reproduction apparatus according to this invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic electrical circuit diagram<br><br>
of an auxiliary audio amplifier of the first preferred embodiment; and<br>
Figure 4 is a fragmentary schematic electrical circuit diagram of the second preferred embodiment of an audio reproduction apparatus according to this invention.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, according to the first preferred embodiment of this invention, an audio reproduction apparatus 6 is shown to include a primary audio amplifier 61, and a plurality of auxiliary audio amplifiers 62.<br>
The primary audio amplifier 61 has an output side 612 for outputting audio signals.<br>
The auxiliary audio amplifiers 62 are coupled electrically in series to the primary audio amplifier 61. Each of the auxiliary audio amplifiers 62 has an input side 625, a signal current generating device 624, a current inducing device, an auxiliary amplifier 622, a loudspeaker 633 and a housing 621. For each auxiliary audio amplifier 62, the input side 625 receives the audio signals from the primary audio amplifier 61. The signal current generating device 62 4, such as a conductive wire, is coupled electrically across the input side 625 such that the audio signals pass through the signal current generating device 624. The current inducing device is disposed adjacent to the signal current generating device 624 for generating induced audio signals when<br><br>
the audio signals pass through the signal current generating device 624 . In this embodiment, the current inducing device includes a coiled core 623 that is annular and that defines a plane with a center. The signal current generating device 624 extends through the center and is perpendicular to the plane, as shown in Figure 3. The auxiliary amplifier 622 is coupled electrically to the current inducing device for amplifying and outputting the induced audio signals generated thereby. The loudspeaker 633 is coupled electrically to the auxiliary amplifier 622 for reproducing the induced audio signals amplified by the auxiliary amplifier 622. The housing 621 receives the signal current generating device 624, the current inducing device, the auxiliary amplifier 622 and the loudspeaker 633 therein.<br>
In this embodiment, the primary audio amplifier 61 further has a control signal generating unit 610 operable so as to generate a series of coded control signals corresponding to the auxiliary audio amplifiers 62, outputted at the output side 612, and received by the auxiliary audio amplifiers 62 at the input sides 625 thereof such that the current inducing device of each auxiliary audio amplifier 62 further generates induced control signals when the control signals pass through the signal current generating device 624.<br>
In this embodiment, each auxiliary audio amplifier<br><br>
62 further has a switch unit 620 received in the housing 621 and coupled electrically between the current inducing device and the auxiliary amplifier 622 and operating, in response to a corresponding one of the induced control signals, at a desired one of an ON-state, where the switch unit 620 makes connection between the current inducing device and the auxiliary amplifier 62 2 , and an OFF-state, where the switch unit 620 interrupts connection between the current inducing device and the auxiliary amplifier 622 such that the induced audio signals are not amplified and outputted by the auxiliary amplifier 622. In other words, through the coded control signals, the switch units 620 of selected auxiliary audio amplifiers 62 can be operated in the OFF-state such that the selected auxiliary audio amplifiers 62 do not reproducethe induced audio signals.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, according to the second preferred embodiment of this invention, an audio reproduction apparatus 5 is shown to include a primary audio amplifier 51, a plurality of auxiliary audio amplifiers 52, an auxiliary signal loop 55, and a plurality of normally-open test switches (SI, S2).<br>
The primary audio amplifier 51 has an output side 510 for outputting audio signals.<br>
The auxiliary audio amplifiers 52 are coupled electrically in series to the primary audio amplifier 51.  Each auxiliary audio amplifier 52 includes an input<br><br>
side 520 for receiving the audio signals from the primary audio amplifier 51, a signal current generating device<br>
524	coupled electrically across the input side 520 such that the audio signals pass through the signal current generating device 524, a current inducing device in the form of a coiled core 523 and disposed adjacent to the signal current generating device 524 for generating induced audio signals when the audio signals pass through the signal current generating device 524, an auxiliary amplifier 522 coupled electrically to the current inducing device for amplifying and outputting the induced audio signals generated thereby, a loudspeaker<br>
525	coupled electrically to the auxiliary amplifier 522 for reproducing the induced audio signals amplified by the auxiliary amplifier 522, and a housing 521 for receiving the signal current generating device 524, the current inducing device, the auxiliary amplifier 522 and the loudspeaker 525 therein. In this embodiment, the coiled core 523 is elongated and is disposed parallel to the signal current generating device 524.<br>
The auxiliary signal loop 55 is coupled electrically across the output side 510 of the primary audio amplifier 52, permits the audio signals from the primary audio amplifier 51 to pass therethrough, and has a plurality of test nodes (A, B).<br>
Each of the normally-open test switches (SI, S2) is connected electrically between a respective one of the<br><br>
test nodes (A, B) and a junction (Jl, J2) of a corresponding adjacent pair of the auxiliary audio amplifiers 52, and is operable via remote control so as to switch from an OFF-state to an ON-state, where the respective one of the test nodes (A, B) is connected electrically to the junction (Jl, J2) of the corresponding adjacent pair of the auxiliary audio amplifiers 52 therethrough, thereby permitting transmission of the audio signals from the primary audio amplifier 51 to bypass a defective one of the auxiliary audio amplifiers 52 via the auxiliary signal loop 55. The following are some of the advantages of the present invention:<br>
1.	Since the audio signals outputted by the primary audio amplifier 61, 51 only pass through the signal current generating device 624, 524 of each of the auxiliary audio amplifiers 61, 51, distortion of the audio signals can be minimized, thereby resulting in a stable audio signal transmission.<br>
2.	Since the audio reproduction apparatus 6, 5 of this invention utilizes the current inducing device of each of the auxiliary audio amplifiers 62, 52 to generate the induced audio signals associated with the audio signals from the primary audio amplifier 61, 51, the number of auxiliary audio amplifiers 62, 52 can be varied according to a user' s requirement such that the audio reproduction apparatus 6, 5 of this invention can provide<br><br>
a wide audio reproduction area.<br>
3. Regardless of how many auxiliary audio amplifiers 62, 52 are used in the audio reproduction apparatus 6, 5 of this invention, impedance matching problem between the output side 610, 510 of the primary audio amplifier<br>
61,	51andtheinput side 625, 520 of each of the auxiliary<br>
audio amplifiers 62, 52 is eliminated such that<br>
replacement of the primary audio amplifier 61, 51 is<br>
not required when the number of auxiliary audio<br>
amplifiers 62, 52 that are in use is increased, thereby<br>
resulting in lower costs.<br>
4 . Due to the presence of the control signal generating unit 610 of the primary audio amplifier 61 and the switch unit 620 of each auxiliary audio amplifier<br>
62,	the audio reproduction apparatus 6 of this invention<br>
can flexibly control reproduction of the audio signals<br>
by the desired auxiliary audio amplifiers 62 .<br>
5. Due to the presence of the auxiliary signal loop 55 and the normally-open test switches (SI, S2), any defective one of the auxiliary audio amplifiers 52 can be detected by operating the test switches (S1, S2), and regardless of the defective auxiliary audio amplifier 52, the audio reproduction apparatus 5 of this invention can still ensure a stable signal transmission.<br><br>
