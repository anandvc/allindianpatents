Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a buttonhole sewing machine for preparing buttonholes on a<br>
work piece of fabric.<br>
Description of Prior Art<br>
The stitching of a buttonhole is one of the most demanding and difficult sewing tasks to<br>
perform with complete success. However a buttonhole apparatus is available in the<br>
market and is adapted to be attached with a conventional sewing machine, primarily<br>
consisting of a body having a slot for the pressure bar, niddle assembly, bobbin set . A<br>
fork arm lever, a presser foot, a special needle setting screw, setting screw on the cover<br>
plate, zigzag width adjusting screws, buttonhole width adjusting screw and buttonhole<br>
length adjusting screws are provided with the apparatus to facilitate the operation of the<br>
sewing machine. To fit the buttonhole apparatus with the sewing machine, the presser<br>
foot and the needle clamp screw are removed from the sewing machine. The special<br>
needle setting screw is used to set the needle. The cover plate is placed on top of the<br>
needle plate in such a way that the needle falls right through the center of the cover plate<br>
slot. Further, the hand-wheel is turned to bring the needle to its highest position and the<br>
buttonhole apparatus is placed from the rear so that the presser bar fits into the slot for<br>
presser bar. If the sewing machine is equipped with a drop feed mechanism, then it must<br>
be ensured that the feed dog or drop feed is placed below the needle plate.<br>
A buttonhole sewing machine is disclosed in the US patent no.5125349 and comprises a<br>
selection switch for the selection as to whether the hole is to cut first or the button hole is<br>
to be defined first. In both the cases, stitch width remains the same. Further the machine<br>
has a startlstop switch as provided in the ordinary machines. Also a needle position<br>
sensor and an offset selection input device are provided to control and easy operation of<br>
i<br>
the machine. *<br>
Another buttonhole machine is disclosed in the US patent no.4458612 and comprises<br>
a.<br>
right and left parallel side stitching parts, and another stitching part connected to the side<br>
stitching part. A switch is provided for detecting front and rear ends of each side stitching<br>
2<br>
.<br>
part, and is capable of sewing the buttonhole in divided parts on opposite sides of a<br>
longitudinal centerline thereof so that the two sides stitching parts are stitched in the same<br>
work feeding direction. The machine also comprises a control circuit generating a feed<br>
change signal when the number of stitches being formed in one of the side stitching parts<br>
has become equal the total number stitches of the other side stitching part less a<br>
predetermined number, and a feed adjusting circuit for reducing a work feeding<br>
increment for a time interval between generation of the change signal and a signal from<br>
the switch, to avoid a difference in the length between the side stitching parts.<br>
US patent no.6223664 B1 teaches regarding another kind of the buttonhole stitching<br>
machine comprising a swing mechanism and feed bracket are controlled to form a<br>
buttonhole defined by settings, such as zigzag stitch length, zigzag pitch, bar-tack length,<br>
bar-tack pitch, and cutter space. The buttonhole can be set on the operation panel and<br>
changed to various shapes by changing the above settings. In particular the left and right<br>
zigzag stitch widths can be set differently, and the fiont and rear bar- tack length can be<br>
also set differently. Thus, the balance of the buttonhole can be finally adjusted.<br>
Disadvantages associated with the prior art<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the prior art. One of the main disadvantages is<br>
that the conventional buttonhole apparatus having more, wear and tear.<br>
Another disadvantage is that pressure foot plate is worn out and therefore button holes are<br>
not stitched in a perfect manner after the regular use of the machine. The machine is not<br>
repairable due to non availability of the spare parts and thus it becomes useless after<br>
some time of use.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the whole assembly including base plate and pressure<br>
foot move during the stitching of the buttonhole and thus the maximum load is carried on<br>
.<br>
by the motor during the stitching operation of the machine.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional machines are heavy and whole<br>
machine is to be lifted even for the minor repair.<br>
A further disadvantage is that a plurality of belts is required to reduce the speed of the<br>
machine for stitching the button holes.<br>
Another disadvantage is that a clutch is needed for changing over the gear box so as to<br>
reduce or increase the speed of the machine.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the maintenance of these machines is very costly as the<br>
spare parts are not available in the domestic market and are to be imported.<br>
Objects and Advantages of the Invention<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to propose a novel buttonhole<br>
stitching machine which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object is to propose a novel machine which is very simple in construction and is<br>
complete in all respect and it is not required to mount the conventional buttonhole<br>
apparatus at all.<br>
Yet another object is to propose a novel machine which is simple in construction,<br>
compact in size , having modular configuration clutch is not required to operate the<br>
machine.<br>
Still another object is to propose a novel machine, the maintenance thereof is very easy.<br>
Also the cost of the machine is very low than the imported machine.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a novel machine wherein a<br>
plurality of the belts is not required to reduce the speed of the machine for stitching the<br>
button hole.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a machine wherein only pressure foot<br>
moves during the stitching operation of the machine. Also the needle changes its<br>
direction from one side to other in order to complete the stitching of the buttonhole on<br>
both the side and thus the load on the machine has been reduced substantially.<br>

Reference to the drawings particularly Fig. 1 the buttonhole stitching machine of the<br>
present invention has a prime maver for eg. An electric motor (1) mounted on the frame<br>
(3) supported on to the main frame (7) of the sewing table. The prime mover (1) is<br>
connected with the main pulley (8) of the machine through a conveyor belt (2). A<br>
pressure pedal (4), start pedal (5) and a clutch pedal (6) are mounted on a pivot rod (9)<br>
movebly. A spring loaded pressure clamp (12) is provided below the stitching means for<br>
holding the job in place for stitching the buttonhole. The stop locking means (17)<br>
comprises an actuating rod (16) and a timer pin (1 8) provided for controlling one cycle of<br>
the buttonhole machine. A gear box (11) having the gear train disposed therein is<br>
provided on the back side of the machine for controlling the motion of the timer plate<br>
(15). A four bar cutter linkage (10) is provided to be actuated by the actuating rod (16)<br>
and cam (13) fitted on to the pulley cap (14). Pressure pedal (4) is used for lifting the<br>
pressure clamp (12) for removing the cloth or inserting the cloth the new cloth after<br>
completing the stitching of all the required buttonholes in the cloth. Pressure pedal (4) is<br>
also used for lifting the pressure clamp (12) for displacing the cloth for stitching the next<br>
buttonhole during the process of the stitching of buttonhole. The start pedal (5) is<br>
provided to start the machine by transferring the belt to the pulley provided on the main<br>
shaft (21) of the machine (see Fig, 3) and by unloading the locking mechanism (17). The<br>
cutter linkage (10) is actuated when the primer plate (15) completes one revolution. Till<br>
the timer pin (18) moves on the surface of the timer plate (15), the locking mechanism<br>
(17) remains unloaded. The timer plate has been designed in such a way that as soon as<br>
the last stitch is complete, the timer pin (1 8) locks the timer plate (15), and thus locking<br>
mechanism and the movement of the actuating means (16) along the cam (13) causes the<br>
movement of the rocker arm of the cutter linkage (10) leading to the blade cutting action.<br>
Main pulley (8) of the motor (1) is connected to the main shaft (21) through the pulleys<br>
(19) and (20) provided on one end of the main shaft (21). Pulley (19) is a free pulley and<br>
pulley (20) is fixed to the main shaft (21). A pairs of bush (59) and (64) are provided at<br>
both the ends of the outer body of the machine such that to support said main shaft (21)<br>
rotatebly. The rotary motion of the main shaft (21) is transferred to other<br>
means/mechanisms with the help of the bevel gears (60) &amp; (63), worm gear (31) and<br>
worm wheel (32) mounted thereon. A crank (65) is provided at the other end of the main .<br>
shaft (21) for providing the jumping motion to the needle as well as to the means<br>
provided for releasing the thread.<br>
The driving motor (1) rotates the free pulley (19) mounted on the main shaft (21)<br>
through the round belt (2) and on pressing the start lever (5), the belt is shifted to the<br>
driving pulley (20) which drives the main shaft (21) and thus the bevel gear (60), worm<br>
(3 1) and bevel gear (63) rotate. The bevel gear (60) transmits the rotary motion from the<br>
main shaft (21) to the shuttle mechanism through another bevel gear (61). The worm (31)<br>
transmits the rotary motion to the worm wheel (32), which transmits the rotary motion to<br>
timer and needle steering mechanisms through the gearbox. The bevel gear (63),<br>
transmits the rotary motion to an arm through another bevel gear (62) for providing<br>
zigzag movement to the needle.<br>
As shown Fig. 3, A timer (1 5) and locking mechanism (1 7) are provided on the same side<br>
of the machine where the driving pulleys (20) &amp; (19) are provided. The belt-changing<br>
lever (22) is attached to the locking mechanism (17), which is pivoted at the pivot (23)<br>
through a link (53) attached to the main body. The force is applied at the point (24)<br>
compressing the high stiffness spring (25). The actuating rod (16) is connected to the rod<br>
(26) and rests over the spring (28). The spring is attached to the surface of a screw (27)<br>
that passes through the nut (29). There is another bolt (30) attached to the frame (17) and<br>
the pivot rod (48) is extended to which the link (50) of the unloading mechanism is<br>
temporarily attached.<br>
The belt (2) is attached to the free pulley (19) when the machine is idling. On pressing the<br>
start pedal (5), the clutch wire attached to arm (24) is pulled, thereby causing the whole<br>
locking mechanism pivoted about pivot (23) to unload and unlocking the pulley cam (1 3)<br>
and timer (10). The restoring force is provided by the spring (25), which compresses<br>
when, the mechanism (17) is unloaded. The locking mechanism gets unloadkd thereby<br>
shifting the belt fiom free pulley (1 9) to keyed pulley (20) through the movement of belt<br>
changing lever (22). This causes motion of the main shaft (21) that drives all other parts<br>
of the machine, until the timer (15) completes one rotation and gets locked again. Once<br>
the mechanism gets unloaded and belt gets engaged, it remains so till the completion of<br>
one revolution of the timer (1 5) since the timer pin (1 8) rests against its surface.<br>
When the last stitch is completed, the actuating pin (16) moves along the surface of the<br>
cam (13). During this movement, the rod (26) also moves along with it and the spring<br>
(28) gets compressed thereby providing the restoring force. Movement of the rod (26)<br>
causes the movement of the four bar linkage cutter mechanism (10) and thus causing the<br>
blade cutting action. The height of the pin (16) and thus the span of the blade can be<br>
adjusted with a screw (27) that controls the length and tension in the spring.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig 4 which shows the unloading of locking mechanism (17)<br>
that is helpful in troubleshooting faults in the machine while the machine is in running<br>
condition. It comprises of two links (51) and link (50) is attached to the locking<br>
mechanism (17) in the loaded position. The link (51) is attached to the main body of the<br>
machine on one end and to link (50) on the other. It consists of a slot (52) in the middle,<br>
which causes the unloading of the machine.<br>
When the locking mechanism (17) is to be unloaded and the link (50) is removed from .<br>
the nut (49) and the start pedal is pushed. On pressing the start pedal, the clutch arm (24)<br>
is pulled and the mechanism moves about the pivot (23) and comes to the position I1 as<br>
shown in the figure. Then the bolt (30) gets fitted into the slot (52) in the link (51). The<br>
position of the slot is such that, the mechanism remains there as long as the link (51) is<br>
not removed from the bolt (30) and the machine keeps on moving irrespective of<br>
completing the buttonhole.<br>
The figure 5 shows the gearbox (1 1) arrangement for timer (1 5) in the machine. The drive<br>
from the motor is supplied to the main shaft (21), which contains a worn (31), which is '<br>
meshed with a worm wheel (32) fitted on shaft (37). The shaft (37) also contains a spur<br>
gear (33), which acts as a pinion to spur gear (39, which is fitted on a small shaft (38)<br>
parallel to shaft (37). The spur gear (35) transfers its motion to a bevel gear (36) through<br>
a collar that moves freely on a fixed shaft (38). Another bevel gear (43) is attached to the<br>
shaft (37) that can be meshed with the gear (40) fitted on the shaft (34). Depending upon<br>
the number of stitches to be made in the buttonhole, one of the bevel gears (39) or (40) on<br>
shaff(34) is meshed with one of the two bevel gears (36) and (43) perpendicular to the<br>
shaft (34). The reduction at this level decides the angular speed of the shaft (34) and thus<br>
the timer (15). The adjuster lever (41) connected to the shaft before the steering wheel<br>
(45), which works through a needle driver (44) that rests on it and moves along the<br>
profile in the slot (48). At the end, the shaft contains a needle translator mechanism (46),<br>
which causes the movement of the presser foot assembly. The adjuster lever (41) moves<br>
on the surface of thin disc (42), which has teeth on its surface and is attached to the shaft<br>
(34). Teeth are made in such a way that the clockwise movement of the adjuster (41)<br>
produces motion of the disc (42) and thus the shaft (34) in the same direction while the<br>
anti-clockwise movement does not produce any motion. This adjuster (41) produces<br>
motion of the disc (42) and thus the shaft (34) in the same direction while anticlockwise<br>
movement does not produce any motion. This adjuster (41) is used to adjust the position<br>
of the needle back to the point where it was stopped in between due to any reason such as<br>
thread breakage, needle breakage etc. The steering mechanism guides the needle along<br>
the width of the buttonhole. The needle steering (45) is made such that the driver (44)<br>
rests on a slot made on it. Two semi-circular slots (48) are made that are offset from the<br>
center and joined at ends through a transition path. When the driver moves on the<br>
steering, it remains at the same X-coordinate as long as it is in the same semi-circle. On<br>
going through the transition slot (48), it moves along the X-axis and then on reaching the<br>
next semi-circular slot, it again gets fixed. Thus the shape of the slot guides the driver<br>
(44) to cause a corresponding motion in the connecting rod (49) that connects the driver<br>
to the needle holder cover. Like the needle steering that causes the displacement of the<br>
needle from one side to other side of the buttonhole, the needle translator (46) causes the<br>
11<br>
presser clamp to move with the work piece along with the length and thereby forming the<br>
shape of a buttonhole. The needle translator (46) consisting of a crank is connected to the<br>
main firame containing the presser footlclamp by a link (47), which causes the translation<br>
motion of mainframe along the length of buttonhole.<br>
As shown in Fig 6 the zigzag motion mechanism for the needle has a bevel gear (62) .<br>
which is driven by bevel gear (63) secured with the main shaft (21). Gear (62) is disposed<br>
in and U shaped cavity provided at one end of the arm (66). The arm (66) is designed in a<br>
specific/peculiar shape such that to be fitted with the design of the outer body of the<br>
machine. A rectangular pin (68) is attached to the arm for providing support thereto.<br>
There is an adjuster (67) provided on the sides of rectangular pin (68) for controlling the<br>
motion of the arm (66). The arm (66) is connected to the needle holder cover (70) at the<br>
lower end thereof through a revolute joint (69). The needle holder cover (70) has a needle<br>
holder (71) in which needle (72) is inserted. When the gear (62) is in motion, the arm<br>
(66) rocks in its plane according to the place adjusted by the adjuster (67). When the<br>
adjuster (67) is in the present orientation, the arm rocks in the Y- direction only since the<br>
pin (68) can move in that direction. The revolute joint (69) thus ensures no movement of<br>
the needle holder cover (70) in that direction. In this orientation, thus there is no zigzag<br>
movement. If the adjuster (67) is in orientation 90 degrees to present, it allows the<br>
movement only along X-axis, which causes the maximum zigzag movement of the needle<br>
holder (58). Thus we can have a large range for width of zigzag stitch.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig, 7, wherein the steering mechanism has been shown. The<br>
profile of the slot in steering (45) causes the movement of the driver (44) along the Xaxis.<br>
The driver (44) is connected to the link (74) through a revolute joint (73). The link<br>
(74) is then connected to the link (75) through another such joint, which goes into the<br>
guide (76), which is pivoted at the point (77) to the main body. Between the pivot and the<br>
guide is the adjustment knob (67), which extends and is attached to the needle holder<br>
cover (70). When the steering wheel (45) rotates, it causes the rocking motion of the<br>
driver (44) that is converted into twisting motion of the link (74) through the joint (73).<br>
Thus through a similar joint, this twisting motion is converted into rocking motion of the<br>
link (75) that has an adjustable length. The link (75) moves inside the guide part of the<br>
link (76), which then oscillates about the pivot point (77). The amplitude of oscillation of<br>
the link (76) causes the movement of the (66) along with it and thus results in the shifting<br>
of the needle holder cover (70). Thus the motion of the driver (44) on the steering wheel<br>
(45) is converted into the movement of needle from one side to the other side of the<br>
buttonhole through the innovative linkage mechanism.<br>
The transmission mechanism for the movement of presser work clamp (86) is shown in<br>
Fig 8. The transmission mechanism has been provided for causing the cloth to move<br>
along the length of buttonhole. In the Fig. the automatic thread cutter mechanism (92) '<br>
and the mechanism for lifting the presser clamp (86) is also shown for feeding the<br>
material for making buttonholes. The needle translator (46) is attached to a frame (79)<br>
through a link (47), which is offset from the center of translator. This link is attached to<br>
the translator at point (78) and to the frame at point (80). Frame (71) is pivoted about the<br>
pivot (93) that is fixed to the sewing machine body. A link (81) and the work clamp (86)<br>
through a prismatic joint (89). The presser rod (82) is joined to the presser block (81) and<br>
thus has a spring (83) on the top, which is compressed by a nut (84) and stores an initial<br>
restoring force that presses the clamp (86). When the needle translatorlcrank (46) rotates,<br>
it causes rocking motion for the frame (79) through the link (47). This rocking leads to<br>
movement of the link (81) along the prismatic joint (89) thus causing the movement of<br>
presser clamp (86) and the automatic thread cutter (92) along the length of the<br>
buttonhole. The presence of the prismatic joint (89) ensures that the presser block (81)<br>
and the rod (82) remain fixed during this translation. On the other hand, the presser pedal .<br>
of the machine is attached to the point (95), which causes the movement of the link (81)<br>
about pivot (94) and thus the lifting of presser clamp (86). Lifting of the clamp causes<br>
compression in the spring, thereby generating a restoring force that presses the material.<br>
The nut (84) above the spring (83) is used to adjust the length of the spring (83) and thus<br>
the pressure of gripping the material. The automatic cutter mechanism is fixed to the<br>
presser clamp (86) at the bottom of the block where the cutter blade (97) is also present.<br>
When the presser clamp (86) moves along the translator, the cutter rod (91) also moves<br>
along with it. However the link (90) at the joint (89) remains fixed. Thus, when the block<br>
(87) reaches beyond the end of the link (90), it gets locked and is then compressed on<br>
Mher movement. So when the complete process is finished, the spring (88) is<br>
completely compressed. The sudden movement of the link (90) releases the block (87)<br>
and the spring (88) and thus causes the cutter blade (97) to cut the thread.<br>
As shown in Fig 9, four-bar linkage cutter means has a main frame (17) having a rod (26)<br>
provided therewith and adapted to move in the slot provided in the link (98). Link (98) is<br>
pivoted about the point (101) and joined to the link (99) at the joint (102). Link (99) is<br>
further connected to the link (100) at the joint (1 03) and is pivoted about the point (104).<br>
Link (100) acts as an actuator for the cutter (108). The cutter (108) moves over a cutter<br>
bar (105), which is fixed at both the ends to the main body; through a link (107) at the<br>
bottom. Blade (109) is present at the end of the cutter (108). The downward motion of the<br>
rod (26) causes the upward movement of link (99) that moves the link (100) about the<br>
pivot (104) and which pushes the cutter downwards. The cutter thus moves along the<br>
cutter rod (105) and compresses the spring (106) that causes it to bounce back when the<br>
link (104) returns after its maximum amplitude. Thus cutting of material takes place.<br>
The automatic thread cutting mechanisms as shown in Fig 10 is provided on both the<br>
sides of the base plate (1 10). The movement of presser clamp (86) causes the movement<br>
of the block (96) in the Z-direction. When it moves behind the link (90), it gets stuck in<br>
its position and the returning of clamp (86) to initial position causes the compression in<br>
the spring and backward movement of the link (91). The backward movement of the link<br>
(91) causes the link (1 12) to move and thus the link (1 13) to rotate. This rotation causes<br>
the blade (97) to come in the open position. When the link (90) is pulled upwards, the<br>
spring is released and link (91) moves back to its original position, thereby causing the<br>
blade to close and cut the thread in this process. The cutter below the base plate has one<br>
end (1 14) fixed to the main body of the machine. Link (1 15) is joined by a revolute joint<br>
to the curved link (1 16), which in turn is joined to the blade (1 17) through a pin (1 18).<br>
When link (1 15) is pressed downwards, the curved link causes the forward movement of<br>
the blade and thus cutting the thread from below in the process.<br>
As shown in Fig 11, the buttonhole counter linkage and the thread loosening means<br>
comprises a frame (1 7) connected to a link (120) through a curved link (1 19). Link (120)<br>
moves along a prismatic joint (121). Another branch link (122) of the linkage causes the<br>
loosening of thread in the thread guide (126). A spring (123) joins the counter lever (124)<br>
to the center of link (120). The backwardforward movement of this lever once causes the '<br>
counter to go up by one. The unloading of frame (17) causes the links to move<br>
backwards, thereby causing the branch link (122) to withdraw from the thread guide<br>
(126). In this process, the counter lever attached to the spring also moves back. After the<br>
completion of the buttonhole, when the frame (17) comes back to its initial position, the<br>
complete linkage moves forward. This causes the branch link (122) to loosen the thread<br>
guide (126) by widening the gap between the two spheres (127) &amp; (128). The spring<br>
(123) exerts force on the counter lever (124) and thus causes it to move forward, thereby<br>
increasing the buttonhole count by one.<br>
