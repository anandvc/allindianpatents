EXISTING PRIOR ART AND THE PROBLEMS :-<br>
For any country to grow, the four basic Infrastructures required are as follows:-<br>
1.	Good road and Transportation System<br>
2.	Good communication system<br>
3.	Good level of education<br>
4.	Awareness and application of the hygiene standards and energy system.<br>
Of these, the invention, lays stress and Good Road, as this comes under Construction Industry's infrastructural needs.<br>
Good road will ease and speed up the transportation system which is not only by adopting well designed good quality roads but also by continuous improvement and maintenance of roads as well. While laying of a good road is the responsibility (^ the owning authorities concerned, maintenance is one for which unfortunately In India neither do we have the right kind of machineries nor agency with pride, man power and attitude to maintain the roads in good condition. Unfortunately, even if there Is a "will* there is no proper modem mechanized system that can take care of<br><br>
road maintenance as the road maintenance system that was followed 75 years before Is still being practiced even today, of course with a progressive degradation in following the standers of use of Material, Method and Man Power (The three Important Ms.)<br>
While better materials can be sourced, unless better methods of using with good trained man power and practice, is put along with, the whole system will fail with roads full of potholes and craters.<br>
Pffthffjg in Rftfliiff<br>
The word must have come into use as a hole Is a pot renders the pot unfit and unsafe for use. Similarly, pothole in a road renders the road unfit and unsafe for use.<br>
The f wwn for pfftholftt<br>
Poverty among the population and potholes In roads are the two sore eyes and stumbling blocks for the growth of any country.<br>
This occurs on the top surface of roads due to;<br>
a.	The debonding of top layer from the bottom bearing layer<br>
b.	Due to the failure of the top bitumen mix layer<br>
c.	Due to seepage of water underneath<br>
d.	Due to excessive load on road<br>
e.	Due to poor construction or due to any one of the above or other reasons.<br>
Hftw it affocte the gmoffth utioft 9f th^ rgad iurfBCB<br>
Driving over the pothole causes mechanical damage to the vehicles, tyre wear and tear and effects the health of the users and also damage to the road by extending the pothole size further to this slows down the traffic movement. If the driver suddenly spots the pothole and applies brake^^ there can be the danger of<br><br>
i vehicle coming behind hitting and leading to accidents.<br>
Why the pothoics should ba rapairad without much dalay<br>
"A stitch in time save nine" is proverb and the repair of a pothole without much delay will save the damage to vehicles, accident and prevents the pothole reaching the size of a crater and allows smoother flow of traffic.<br>
What ia tha normal oothoia ai»a<br>
When potholes appear, they will be something of the size of about 1' x 1', about 1 or 2"deep and if left unattended quicldy shall reach the size of even 8' x 8' and 2' deep. There are potholes on the road surface in Tamiinadu, Karnataka and Goa of the above size requiring 6" to 8" size boulder soling to be filled to make up the level. This is only due to not attending to potholes on time. Also due to potholes, vehicles will move slowly using more fuel, wasting time and polluting the atmosphere.<br>
How potholaa wara of iaaa aarioua oroblama in tha paat and now mora<br>
fgrlffui of lato<br>
In earlier days length of road was less, the quality of workmanship was better, vehicles using the road, the number, speed and laden weight etc., were less, the quality of maintenance was better, thus potholes never reached a dangerous level of attention in the past.<br>
Nowadays, the length of road has increased, the quality of workman ship has decreased, the number of vehicles using the roads have increased and also the vehicle load carrying capacity and speed, thus leading to failure of road and more potholes and with less and improper maintenance it has reached a dangerous level of national debate and attention.<br>
How it was prepared in the past, present and by the new system are being explained briefly below;<br><br>
Z.        r&gt;OTHOLE TRIMMING<br>
a)	Earlier, In the manual system, the pothole pits used to be properly trimmed and cleaned.<br>
b)	Nowadays. In the manual system this is not being done and just	some filling material of WBM or bitumen mix is filled In and Ijeft to the vehicles passing over to do the job of consolidation.<br>
c)	In our mechanical system, the pothole side surface and the bottom will be properly chipped with mechanical tools, brought to some proper geometric shape and made fit to receive further stages of work.<br>
II.	PIT CLEANING<br>
a)	In the earlier manual system, the pits were broomed and cleaned and the debris removed.<br>
b)	Presently, In the manual system, the same Is not being done due to lac)
c)	In our mechanical system the surface will be cleaned using cleaning brushes and the dust particles are removed using Pneumatic air blower, thus making the surface absolutely dean,<br>
III.	PIT'S SURFACE PREPARATION<br>
a)	In the earlier manual system, if the surface was wet there was no way to make it dry. Further, since bitumen will not stick to a wet surface, mud and jelly etc, will be filled and allowed to get compacted with vehicle movement.<br>
b)	Presently, in the manual system, cold bitumen mix is filled in pits and allowed to get consolidated with vehicle movement. Further this will not stick to the surface due to the present of moisture.<br><br>
c)	In our mechanical system, the surface shall be dried using flame torch,<br>
heated and dried and brought to the perfect condition required for bonding of new bitumen/tack coat.<br>
IV.     PIT FILLING MATERIAL<br>
a)	In the older days, in the manual system, jelly and bitumen used to be mixed, heated to a warm condition, filled in pits and tamped to some level surface.<br>
b)	Presently, in the manual system, warm/cold asphalt mix Is filled and left for passing vehicle to do the job of consolidation. The warm/cold mix asphalt performances will not be as good as hot mix asphalt and will not stick to the old surface.<br>
c)	In our mechanical system, hot asphalt mix is carried to site and kept warm in the bucket. This shall be filled in the pit, heated with a flame torch and compacted using pneumatic rammers which does a perfect job, reaching compaction level similar to a Road Roller passing over the surface. The top surface can further be sealed using seal coat mix laid, heated and tamped mechanically, llius the top surface is well sealed.<br>
This kind or thought has never applied In the past nor now to look into the problem that Is effecting the basic Infrastructure of the country.<br>
The new mechanized hydro &amp; pneumatic system can carry out a perfect road reconditioning work at 1/30* of the labor cost and thus productivity Is Increased by more than 30 to 40 times and the exact data and cost economics can be worked out for the needy users based on their inputs. However, it is beyond and doubts that since the system is a mechanized one, it requires less labor yiefding higher production and better quality standards and thus better roads.<br>
The Idea of the above equipment Is Innovative and this Is the first equipment to be produced in the sub-continent including Pakistan, Bangladesh and far eastern countries.   Now it is for the users, desirous of giving a good road surface for the<br><br>
growth of the country to opt for the new system which is innovative, cost effective and right solution to have a pothole-free road surface.<br>
