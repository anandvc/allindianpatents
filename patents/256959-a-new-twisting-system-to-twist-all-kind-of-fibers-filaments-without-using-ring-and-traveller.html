				<td>As ring and traveler arrangement limits the productivity and quality of conventional ring spun yam, it is aimed to remove that by changing the entire twisting principle of conventional ring spinning. In the modified twisting system, yarn package is kept in a horizontal manner and rotated in two directions to enable both twisting and winding. The horizontal wise rotation of package inserts twist and vertical wise rotation of package wind the yarn. As the twisted yarn directly passed onto the package present in horizontal manner, the balloon collapse happening in conventional ring spinning is avoided and the diameter of the balloon is reduced.

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>a <br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed-<br>
a)	Field of Invention<br>
Spinning - Twisting system without Ring and Traveller.<br>
b)	Background of the Invention with Regard Drawback Associated with Prior<br>
Art<br>
The primary technological limitation of ring spinning system in achieving higher production rate lies in the ring-traveller arrangement. The maximum traveller speed achievable in the present ring spinning system is 46m/s, which limits the winding rate of the yam.<br>
In ring spinning, yam rotation around the package is necessitated to insert twist and to wind the yarn on the package, which causes balloon formation and tension in the yarn. The breakage of yarn will happen whenever the tension present in the yam exceeds the strength of the yarn during spinning. The tensile strength of coarser yarn is much higher than the spinning tension developed as compared to finer yam. However, while increasing the production rate for coarser yarn, the balloon collapses and the yam is wrapped around the spindle cop that leads to yarn breakage.<br>
Conventional ring spinning system does not allow spinning of all type of materials due to collapsing of balloon. The necessary modifications should be made in conventional ring frame to avoid balloon collapse while producing yam such as glass yam, metallic yam and carbon yam. The balloon collapse can be prevented by (i) increasing ring diameter, (ii) using heavier traveller and (iii) decreasing spindle speed. But the reduction of spindle speed will decrease the production rate, the use of heavier traveller will reduce the life of the ring and also<br><br>
will produce more noise. Also the spinning tension required to twist and produce such yam is quite higher than that is possible with the present ring and traveller twisting system.<br>
The production limiting parameters of the conventional ring spinning system has been eliminated by rotor, friction and air-jet spinning system by modifying the principle of twisting. The production rates of these spinning systems are nearly 10 times greater than that of ring spinning system. However, the yarn produced by the above systems show poor quality than the ring yam due to poor alignment of fibers in the yam stmcture and also limits the production of finer count. The spinning triangle formed in the conventional ring spinning system clamps both the ends of the fibers between the convergence point and the front roller nip and twists them compactly. And also gives better fiber migration that leads to better yam quality. During twisting, the surface fibers get a greater stretch compared to the fibers at its centre, due to their long helical path on the yam surface. This results in a tensile force differences among the fibers thus fibers are migrated from one radial position to other radial position.<br>
The conventional ring spinning system limits the production rate (maximum up to 20m/min), count range (lONe to 120Ne) and not allowing to produce yarn from any kind of material.<br>
Therefore a new method of twisting with the existing drafting system of ring frame is required to twist the fiber web in the form of triangle to produce good quality yam. The new method should involve (i) twisting without use of traveller and (ii) avoid formation of balloon. In the developed twisting system, traveller is eliminated and the yam is not rotating around the package instead directly passed onto the surface of the package. Hence, the diameter of the balloon reduced, which makes easy production of coarser yam count even below 5Ne from<br><br>
any kind of material (metallic wire, carbon and glass etc) with higher production rate.<br>
c)	Objective of the Invention<br>
&gt;	To eliminate ring and traveller of the conventional ring spinning system in order to achieve higher production rate.<br>
&gt;	To avoid yam rotation around the package to insert twist and to wind the yarn on the package in order to avoid balloon collapse and easy twisting of any kind of materials (e.g., drafted staple fibers, polyester, nylon and glass filaments and metallic wires etc).<br>
&gt;	To twist fibers / filaments by clamping the end at one point and rotating the other end in order to achieve a compact twisted fiber/filament assembly.<br>
&gt;	To spin yarn with wide count range (even below 5 Ne).<br>
d)	Summary of the Invention<br>
The principle of twisting system present in the ring spinning system necessitates to rotate yam around the package which causes to form a balloon and the yam carrying element (i.e. Traveller) requires to move at high speed over a stationary element (i.e. Ring). The formation of balloon and friction generated between traveler and ring limits the production rate. And the friction generated in the yam by ring and traveller affects the quality of the yam. However the conventional system twists the fibers compactly by holding both the ends of fibers between front bottom roller and twisting point which helps to achieve a great strength.<br><br>
In the modified twisting system, the ring and traveler set-up has been eliminated and the yarn is directly passed onto the surface of the package. And the fibers/filaments are twisted by clamping both the ends between feed roller and convergence point as like ring spinning system for that the drafting system of ring frame is used.<br>
As the yam is not rotated around the package the balloon diameter has been reduced to the maximum extent. In this system the rate of twisting and winding is limited only by the minimum diameter formed and not by the ring and traveller. The balloon collapse is fully avoided even it happens it could not able to get wrapped over the package as like ring spinning hence twisting of any kind of material is possible.<br>
4. DESCRIPTION OF THE DESIGN<br>
In the modified twisting system, the yarn package is kept in horizontal manner and rotated in two directions to enable both winding of yam on the package and inserting twist on the yam (Figure 1). The horizontal wise rotation of the package inserts twist and vertical wise rotation of the package wind the yam.<br>
Twisting and winding of yam is carried out by using two different motors. The speed variable frequency motor pulley is directly fixed with vertical shaft (22) of the twisting system by coupling, A bevel gear (A) present in the other end of the vertical shaft is meshed with the bevel gear (B) present in the shaft of winding drum. The yarn package is kept over the winding grooved drum (15) and loaded by compression spring (13). Another motor pulley is connected with the pulley of hollow shaft (5) of the cylinder by means of belt. The drives given from these two motors rotate cylinder and package in same direction with slight speed difference. This speed difference is taken for winding the yarn on the package.<br><br>
The winding and twisting rate of the yam can be calculated by using the equation given below<br>
Winding rate in m/min = (Cs - Vs) x (Vt/ Dt) x d x π;<br>
TCwisting rate in Twist/meter = Cs/(Cs - Vs) x (Vt/ DO x d x 71<br>
Where,<br>
s	-	Cylinder speed in rpm<br>
Vs	-	Vertical shaft (22) speed in rpm<br>
Vt	-	No. of teeth present in the bevel gear of vertical shaft<br>
Dt	-	No. of teeth present in the bevel gear of winding drum<br>
d	-	Diameter of the grooved winding drum in m.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
5. CLAIM<br>
"A new twisting system to twist all kind of fibers / Filaments without using Ring and Traveller" comprising:<br>
Rotation of the yam package simultaneously in two directions (i.e. horizontal wise and vertical wise) to enable both twisting of staple fibers/filaments and winding of yarn.<br></td>
