DESCRIPTION<br>
RADIATION SENSITIVE REFRACTIVE INDEX CHANGING COMPOSITION<br>
AND REFRACTIVE INDEX CHANGING METHOD<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition, a refractive index pattern forming method, a refractive index pattern and an optical material. More specifically, it relates to a novel radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition which is used in the optoelectronic and display fields, a refractive index pattern forming method, a refractive index pattern and an optical material. Prior Art<br>
In the current society called "multi-media society", refractive index distribution type optically molded products each consisting of different refractive index regions are in great demand.  The products include not only optical fibers for transmitting information but also optical diffraction gratings having a periodical change in refractive index, optical memories to which information is written at sites having different refractive indices, optically coupled elements such as optical IC's having a fine refractive index pattern, optical control elements, optical modulation elements and optical transmission elements.<br>
The refractive index distribution type optically molded products are divided into two types: one having a continuous refractive index distribution, such as GI type optical fibers (to be referred to as "GRIN optically molded products" hereinafter) and the other having a discontinuous refractive index distribution, such as optical diffraction gratings and SI type optical waveguides.<br>
The GRIN optically molded products are attracting much<br><br>
attention as the next-generation optically molded products. For example, a GI type optical fiber whose refractive index is reduced from the center axis of the core of the optical fiber to the periphery in a parabolic form enables the transmission of a great volume of information, A GRIN lens whose refractive index continuously changes therein is used as a reading lens for use in copiers, spherical lens for connecting fibers, or micro-lens, making use of its characteristic features that it has refractive power even with a flat surface and that it is free from spherical aberration.<br>
A large number of methods of producing the above GRIN optically molded products have been proposed up till now. For example, JP-A 9-133813, JP-A 8-336911, JP-A 8-337609, JP-A 3-192310, JP-A 5-60931 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexaminedpublished Japanese patent application"), WO93/19505 and WO94/04949 disclose a method of obtaining a GI type optical fiber by dispersing low molecular weight compounds or a monomer into a polymer and continuously distributing its concentration. JP-A 62-25705 discloses that a GI type rod-like optically molded product or optical fiber is obtained by photo-copolymerizing two or more vinyl monomers having different diffraction indices and reactivity rations. Further, JP-A 7-56026 discloses a method of obtaining a refractive index distribution by forming a polymer A having a photo-reactive functional group, dispersing a compound B having a lower refractive index than the polymer A into the polymer A to form the concentration distribution of the compound B and photo-reacting the polymer A with the compound B.<br>
Some methods of producing GRIN optically molded products of an inorganic material have also been proposed. One of them is, for example, a method of producing a GI type rod by adding high-refractive index thallium to rod-like glass essentially<br><br>
composed of silicon or lead, immersing the glass in a molten solution containing low-refractive index potassium, and forming a potassium concentration distribution by ion exchange.<br>
A GRIN lens can be obtained likewise by applying the above method to a short rod, that is, lens-like optically molded product. Alternatively, the GI type rod produced by the above method may be sliced.<br>
As one of methods of producing an optically molded product having a fine refractive index pattern, such as the above optical diffraction grating or optical IC, there is known a technology for obtaining a change in refractive index by causing a photochemical reaction in a molded product by the irradiation of light. For instance,, in the case of an inorganic material, glass doped with germanium is irradiated with light to change its refractive index to produce an optical diffraction grating. In the case of an organic material, the above technology is known as a photochromic reaction or photobleaching and JP-A 7-92313 discloses a technology for obtaining an optical diffraction grating by causing a change in refractive index by irradiating a material containing low molecular weight compounds having photochemical reactivity dispersed in a polymer with a laser beam. Further, JP-A 9-178901 has recently proposed that this technology is applied to the production of a GRIN optically molded product. This method*provides a continuous refractive index distribution in a depth direction with respect to irradiation, making use of the fact that light irradiated onto a molded product is absorbed and weakened in intensity.<br>
However, in the refractive index distributions obtained with the above conventional materials , the maximum refractive index difference is about 0.001 to 0.02 and it is difficult to provide a wider refractive index distribution in order to prevent an optical loss and suppress the malfunction of<br><br>
a circuit.<br>
When the above conventional materials are used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used for changing the refractive index passes therethrough after a refractive index distribution is formed, it is impossible to prevent such a phenomenon that a gradual change in refractive index occurs, thereby deteriorating the materials. Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above problems of the prior art.<br>
That is, it is an object of the present invention to provide a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition whose refractive index of materials is changed by a simple method, whose changed refractive index difference is sufficiently large, and which can provide a stable refractive index pattern and a stable optical material regardless of use conditions.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition which forms fine pores upon exposure to radiation, retains the formed fine pores stably, and provides a refractive index pattern having high film strength although it has a large number of fine pores.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method of forming a refractive index pattern from the above composition of the present invention.<br>

A commonly used method may be used to form the refractive index changing composition of the present invention. For example, injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, in-case frame polymerization, - shaving, drawing, heating/cooling, CVD deposition, sintering or scanning is employed.  Spin coating, slitting, bar coating, solvent casting, LB, spraying, roll coating, relief-printing or screen printing may also be used according to the application-purpose of an optically molded product.<br>

A hot plate or oven, or infrared radiation may be used for heating.<br><br>
The radiation used for exposure is an i-ray having a wavelength of 365 nm, h-ray having a wavelength of 404 nm,<br>

wavelength of 193 nm. X-ray such as synchrotron radiation,<br>

or a mixture thereof. Out of these, ultraviolet radiation<br>
and visible radiation are preferred. The illuminance which<br>
depends on the wavelength of the radiation is preferably 0.1<br>
to 100 mW/cm2 because the highest reaction efficiency is<br>
obtained. The irradiation of the radiation through a pattern<br>

refractive index changing material. As for patterning<br>
accuracy which is affected by a light source used, an optical<br>
part having a refractive index variation distribution with<br>

The re-exposure may be carried out by irradiating<br><br>
radiation having the same wavelength as the radiation used to change the refractive index onto the entire surface of the pattern in the same amount.<br>

The treatment with the stabilizer (D) is preferably carried out after post-exposure baking.<br>
The stabilizer (D) has the function of stabilizing the residual decomposable compound (A) contained in the refractive index changing material after exposure to provide stability to an acid or base. This stabilization prevents a change in refractive index and hence the deterioration of a refractive index pattern formed by the method of the present invention even when it is used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the refractive index passes therethrough.<br>
A low-boiling compound such as ammonia or triethylamine may be used as the stabilizer (D) besides the above examples.<br>

For instance, the component (D) and optionally a catalyst are dissolved in a suitable solvent to be contacted to the refractive index changing composition as a solution. Alternatively, when the component (D) is liquid or gas under contact conditions, it may be 100 % directly contacted to<br><br>
the refractive index changing composition.<br>
When a solvent is used in the reaction between the above stabilizer (D) and the component (A) , the solvent preferably dissolves the component (D) and an optionally added catalyst and does not dissolve the component (A).

Further, re-exposure may be carried out to decompose the residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion and further improve the stability of the material.<br>

This solution is used as a fiber stock solution, defoamed, stretched by heating, exposed to a laser beam and extruded to form a fiber. The pore diameter may be 0.1 to 1.0 mm and the stretching speed may be 0.1 to 1,000 m/min.<br>
The fiber formed as described above is then exposed to light uniformly from therearound toward the center using a ring light source together with an optical fiber or reflector and post exposured baked to form the optical fiber of the present invention. The PEB temperature may be 50 to 200° C and the baking time may be 1 second to 30 minutes. A suitable heating source such as an infrared lamp may be used as the heating source.<br>

The above fiber stretching device, exposure device and heating device may be arranged side by side. Thereby, an GI type optical fiber can be produced continuously. <method of forming a lens><br><br>
The lens of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for example, the following method.<br>
(1)	method of forming a GRIN lens having concave lens power<br>
A photosensitive refractive index changing composition used for the formation of a lens can be dissolved in a suitable solvent before use. The solvent used may be a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200° C and the solid content of the obtained solution may be 50 to 80 %• This solution is formed into a disk having a desired shape by hot pressing or the like.<br>
Thereafter, the disk is exposed to light in such a manner that the amount of exposure is large at the center portion of the disk and decreases toward the periphery of the disk and then post exposured baked to form a GRIN lens having concave lens power. The exposure device is such as shown in Fig. 1. The diaphragm 2 which can be opened or closed is installed in front of a disk sample 1 of the exposure device of Fig.<br>
1,	only parallel rays from the above light source are irradiated<br>
onto the sample by gradually opening the closed diaphragm<br>
2,	and the shutter speed is adjusted such that the diaphragm<br>
2 is fully opened in 1 second to 5 minutes to achieve the<br>
above exposure state.<br>
The post exposured baking conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200° C and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes.<br>
(2)	method of forming a GRIN lens having convex lens power<br>
A similar disk sample to that described above (1) is exposed to light in such a manner that the amount of exposure is large at the periphery of the disk and decreases toward the center of the disk and then post exposured baked to form a GRIN lens having convex lens power.<br>
This exposure state can be obtained by inputting light uniformly from the side only while the top and bottom portions of the cylinder are shielded from light. An optical fiber or reflector may be used for uniform exposure from the side.<br><br>
The same PEB conditions as (1) above may be employed. <method of forming an optical waveguide><br>
The optical waveguide of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for example, the following method.<br>
A photosensitive refractive index changing composition for forming an optical waveguide may be dissolved in a suitable solvent before use (solution A). The solvent used may be a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200° C and the solid content of the obtained solution may be 20 to 60 %.<br>
Separately from this solution, a composition solution comprising the component (B) and a thermal acid generator and/or a photo acid generator is prepared (solution B) . The solid content of this solution may be 20 to 60 % and a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 200°C may be used.<br>
The solution B is first applied to a suitable substrate such as a silicon substrate or glass substrate and then the solvent is removed to form a coating film as thick as 1 to 50 Jim. This coating film serves as a lower clad layer. Spin coating or slit coating may be employed to apply the solution B and heating may be carried out at 50 to 150° C for 1 to 30 minutes to remove the solvent.<br>
Thereafter, the solution-A is applied to the lower clad layer formed as described above and then the solvent is removed to form an intermediate layer as thick as 1 to 50 p. The coating method and the removal of the solvent may be the same as described above.<br>
Subsequently, the intermediate layer is exposed to light through a photomask for shielding the core portion of a waveguide pattern from light and post exposured baked. The unexposed portion serves as a core portion and the exposed portion serves as a side clad layer. The post exposured baking conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200° C and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes.<br>
The solution B is applied to the above intermediate layer<br><br>
again and then the solvent is removed to form an upper clad layer as thick as 1 to 50 jim, thereby making it possible to form an optical waveguide. Since the obtained optical waveguide contains the thermal acid generator in the upper and lower clad layers, an acid slightly formed is diffused at the interfaces between the core layer and the lower clad layer and between the core layer and the upper clad layer. Thereby, the interfaces between the core layer and the clad layers can take such a structure that the refractive index changes gradually in the upper, side and lower portions with the result that a GI type optical waveguide is obtained. <method of forming a recording medium><br>
The recording medium of the present invention may be formed by a suitable method, for example, the following method.<br>

This solution is applied to a flat plastic substrate having a metal film such as an aluminum film having a thickness of about 60 nm and then the solvent is removed to form a coating film as thick as 0.1 to 10 pm. Spin coating or slit coating may be used to apply the solution, and the solvent can be removed by heating at 50 to 150°C for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
Thereafter, this coating film is exposed to light through a photomask having a track pick of 1.6 pm at a pitch width of 0.2 to 0.5 p and post exposured baked to form an optical recording medium. The post exposured baking conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200° C and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes. <method of forming a diffraction grating><br>

This solution is applied to the surface of a suitable substrate such as a glass substrate and then the solvent is removed to form a thin coating film as thick as 1 to 50 pm. Spin coating or slit coating may be used to apply the solution, and the solvent can be removed by heating at 50 to 150° C for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
This coating film is exposed to light in a slit form and post exposured baked to form a diffraction grating. To irradiate slit-form light, for example, the method shown in Fig. 2 may be employed. Fig. 2 shows that parallel rays reflected by a reflector placed obliquely are irradiated onto a coating film. The coating film is exposed to an interference pattern formed by direct rays and reflected rays . The sample is moved in a direction shown by an arrow in the figure at a speed of 0.1 to 100 pm/min while it is illuminated to form a diffraction grating having a desired cycle of 0.3 pm or more. A fine refractive index distribution can be provided by this method.<br>
Another method of irradiating slit-form light is to irradiate the coating film formed as described above with a plurality of radial rays from different directions for interference or to irradiate light through slits. In either method, a diffraction grating having a desired cycle can be formed by changing the input angle of light or the angle of a mirror.<br>
The above post exposured baking conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200° C and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes. <method of forming a hologram element><br><br>

This solution is applied to a suitable substrate such as a glass substrate and then the solvent is removed to form a thin film as thick as 1 to 50 pm. Spin coating or slit coating may be employed to apply the solution. The solvent can be removed by heating at 50 to 150°C for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
This coating is irradiated with an interference pattern and post exposured baked to form a recording medium (hologram) for holography. That is, signal light passing through a substance to be recorded and reference light directly obtained from the same light source are interfered with each other and irradiated onto the coating film to change the refractive index, thereby making it possible to record an image of the substance on the coating film.<br>
The above post exposured baking conditions include a temperature of 50 to 200° C and a time of 1 second to 30 minutes.<br>

(inner diameter of 55 mm) for 20 seconds and post exposured baked at 120° C for 2 minutes . Thereby, an optically molded disk whose refractive index continuously decreased from the center to the periphery was obtained. The optically molded product had a refractive index difference of 0.08 and functioned as a GRIN lens having convex lens power. Example 42 (production of GI type optical waveguide)<br>
50 parts by weight of the compound (A-2) as the component (A), 50 parts by weight of a condensate of methyltrimethoxysilane (weight average molecular weight of 2,000) as the component (B) and 1 part by weight of 4-phenylthiophenyldiphenylsulfonium<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonateas the component (C) were dissolved in diethylene glycol ethyl methyl ether to a total solids content of 40 %, and the resulting solution was filtered with a membrane filter having a pore diameter of 1.0 pm to prepare a solution containing a photosensitive refractive index<br><br>
changing composition (S-l). 100 parts by weight of a condensate of methyltrimethoxysilane (weight average molecular weight of 2,000) used as the component (B) and 1 part by weight of the SI-L150 (of Sanshin Kagaku Co. , Ltd. ) as a thermally acid generator were dissolved in diethylene glycol ethyl methyl ether to a total solids content of 40 % to prepare a solution (S-2).<br>
The solution (S-2) was first applied to the surface of a silicon substrate with a spin coater and dried at 70° C for 10 minutes, and the entire surface of the formed coating film was exposed to ultraviolet radiation having an illuminance of 4.0 mW/cm2 and a wavelength of 365 nm for 5 seconds to form a 10 pm-thick lower clad layer. Thereafter, the solution (S -1) was applied to the lower clad layer with a spin coater and dried at 70° C for 10 minutes to form a 10 pm-thick intermediate layer which was then exposed to ultraviolet radiation having an illuminance of 4.0 mW/cm2 and a wavelength of 365 nm for 10 seconds through a photomask having an optical waveguide pattern and a width of 4 to 20 p for 10 seconds. Thereafter, the intermediate layer was post exposured baked at 120° C for 2 minutes. The unexposed portion served as a core portion and the exposed portion served as a side clad layer. The solution (S-2) was applied to this intermediate layer with a spin coater and dried at 70° C for 10 minutes to form a 10 pm-thick upper clad layer whose entire surface was then exposed to ultraviolet radiation having an illuminance of 4.0 mW/cm2 and a wavelength of 365 nm for 5 seconds and post exposured baked at 120° C for 2 minutes to produce an optical waveguide. The refractive indices for light having a wavelength of 1,550 nm of the formed upper, side and lower clad layers were 1.42. In contrast to this, the refractive index for light having a wavelength of 1,550 nm of the core layer was 1.50 and the<br>
maximum refractive index difference An was 0.08. As the obtained optical waveguide contained an optically acid<br><br>
generator in the upper and lower clad layers, the diffusion of a slightly generated acid occurred at the interfaces between the core layer and the upper clad layer and between the core layer and the lower clad layer. Thereby, a refractive index distribution was formed at the interfaces of the upper, side and lower clad portions with the core layer, whereby the obtained optical waveguide was of a GI type. As for the obtained optical waveguide, when the loss of the waveguide was obtained by measuring the amount of light output from the other end when light having a wavelength of 1,300 nm was input from one end of the waveguide, it was 0.1 dB/cm or less. Example 43 (production of optical recording medium)<br>
50 parts by weight of the compound (A-2) as the component (A) , 50 parts by weight of a condensate of methyltrimethoxysilane (molecular weight of 2,000) as the component (B) and 1 part by weight of 4-phenylthiophenyldiphenylsulfonium<br>
trif luoromethanesulfonate as the component (C) were dissolved in diethylene glycol ethyl methyl ether to a total solids content of 20 % and the resulting solution was filtered with a membrane filter having a pore diameter of 0.2 junto prepare a solution containing a photosensitive refractive index changing composition. This solution was applied to a flat polycarbonate substrate having a 60 nm-thick aluminum reflective film deposited by sputtering with a spin coater and dried at 80° C for 2 minutes to forma.1.0 pm-thick refractive index changing layer. Thereafter, the refractive index changing layer was exposed to ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength of 365 nm and an illuminance of 40 mW/cm2 through a mask having a pitch width of 0.5 pm at a track pitch of 1.6 pm for 5 seconds and post exposured baked at 120° C for 2 minutes. Thereby, the refractive index difference between the exposed portion and the unexposed portion was 0.08 at 633 nm and could be read perfectly as an optical recording<br><br>
medium.<br>
Example 44 (production of optical IC)<br>
50 parts by weight of the compound (A-2) as the component (A), 50 parts by weight of a condensate of methyltrimethoxysilane (weight average molecular weight of 2,000) as the component (B) and 1 part by weight of 4-phenylthiophenyldiphenylsulfonium<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonate as the component (C) were dissolved in diethylene glycol ethyl methyl ether to a total solids content of 33 % and the resulting solution was filtered with a membrane filter having a pore diameter of 1.0 pm to prepare a solution containing a photosensitive refractive index changing composition. This solution was applied to the surface of a glass substrate with a spin coater and dried at 70°C for 10 minutes, and the applied layer was exposed to ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength of 365 nm and an illuminance of 4.0 mW/cm2 through a mask having a width of 100 pm for 5 seconds and post exposured baked at 120°C for 2 minutes. As a result, an optical IC having a 100 pm refractive index pattern could be obtained. Example 45 (production of optical diffraction grating)<br>
The solution prepared in Example 42 was used to produce a film sample measuring 2 cm x 1 cm x 10 pm. This sample was exposed to ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength of 365 nm and an illuminance of 4.0 mW/cm2. Parallel rays 9 from the exposure device 8 were reflected by a refle.ctor 7 placed at an angle of 45° and irradiated onto the film sample 5 on a stage 6 as shown in Fig. 2. The sample was illuminated with an interference pattern formed by reflected light and directly irradiated light. The sample was moved at a speed of 1 pm/min in a direction shown by an arrow in the figure upon exposure with the result that an optical diffraction grating having a cycle of 0.5 pm was obtained. Example 46 (production of hologram)<br><br>
Parallel rays having a wavelength of 365 nm and an illuminance of 4.0 mW/cm2 were divided into two optical paths by a half mirror, one was let pass through a transparent substance as signal light and was interfered with the other as reference light, and the obtained interference pattern was irradiated onto the same optically molded product as in Example 45. An image of the substance recorded at a high resolution could be confirmed by illuminating the obtained optically molded product with light for reproduction.<br><br><br>
