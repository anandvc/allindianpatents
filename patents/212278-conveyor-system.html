FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention has to do with a conveyor system for the conveying of fiat, non-magnetizable objects, preferably tube sections that are made of foils and paper, whereby the conveyor system is equipped with at least one revolving conveyor belt, preferably a conveyor belt and a support which prevents a movement of the object in relation to the revolving conveyor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Conveyor systems of this type are generally familiar. Such conveyors as a rule consist of two continuous conveyor belts arranged over each other that are guided around via guide rollers- Flat, non-magnetic objects are now conveyed to such a conveyer system in such a way that they are stuck in between the branches of the two conveyors lying one over the other. In order to prevent a sliding around of the objects in relation to the conveyor belts, sufficient friction between these objects and the branches must exist. To insure adequate friction the conveyors' branches that are turned toward each other still must be compressed additionally for the rail tension of the branches. With the familiar type of conveyor systems this is achieved with the aid of a large number of rollers that run on the sides of the branches that are turned away from the objects or the paths of the materials. The rollers are bedded in such a spring-like way that the rollers constantly exert a force on the branches for the latter to be pressed in an even stronger way toward each other.<br><br>
2/9<br>
A disadvantage of these conveyor systems is the mechanical complexity for the rollers that are needed in a considerable number in this type conveyor system.<br>
However, other conveyor systems are known with which the conveyor belt of one of the conveyors is equipped with needles that puncture flat objects. Flat objects now can no longer move in relation to the branch of the conveyor assigned. Such types of conveyor systems, for example, are used in so-called valve sheet feeders that serve to manufacture valve sacks, in which tube pieces are conveyed between various processing stations and processed there in each case, whereby the pieces of tube remain on the conveyor belt. Since the processing of the tube sections preferentially is carried out on one of the flat sides of the objects, no traditional conveyor can be arranged on this side of the piece of tube. The use of a needle conveyor as our conveyor is imperative under these circumstances. The upper conveyor is discontinued in such a mechanism.<br>
A disadvantage of the needle conveyor at any rate is that flat objects or material paths are damaged by the perforations of the needles.<br>
For this reason the DE 43 02 827 Al and the DE 199 B 37 048 Al propose conveying mechanisms for conveying thin, flattish conveyor goods, in which the bands attract each other due to the magnetic forces dispensed with due to the magnetic forces of attraction. The mechanisms shown in the aforementioned brochures can be described in the following way: A conveyor system for conveying fiat non-magnetizable objects, preferably tube sections or material pipelines made of foils or paper,<br>
whereby the conveyor system is equipped with at least one revolving conveyor,<br>
preferably a conveyor belt and<br><br>
3<br>
-	a support, which prevents the object from moving in relation to the<br>
revolving conveyor,<br>
-	whereby the support contains at least two components made from<br>
magnets or magnetically attractable material, which exert magnetic<br>
forces on each other and<br>
-	whereby the first component is arranged in or on the revolving<br>
conveyor.<br>
The conveyor system shown in both of these brochures are mechanically to propose a complex, however, due to their double-belted conveyor design.<br>
US patent US 176352 constitutes state of the art technology, in which textile fibre material is conveyed between a resting plate and a revolving belt. The magnetic belt is pulled against the steel plate and holds the fibre level. The actual conveyor force is created by pairs of rollers in front of and behind the belt/plate arrangement.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a conveyor system that is simpler to design.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
On this the invention at hand conceptually comes from both of the aforementioned brochures and resolves the problem thereby<br><br>
3a<br>
-	that the second component is arranged in or on a backing run<br>
which moves slower in relation to the conveying mechanism of the<br>
conveyor or is stationary and<br>
-	that the first and second component are arranged in or on at least<br>
one conveyor and the backing run in such a way that the forces<br>
arising between the components of the support at least in part can<br>
be imparted to the flat objects.<br>
At the same time the components of the support are compressed in the usual way so strongly that the objects to be conveyed between these supports are held. The magnetic forces are converted into mechanical forces by means of compression, whereby the forces acting on the object provide for pressing onto the conveyor in such a way that the object is stationary in relation to the conveyor.<br>
If the inventive mechanism is used at a plant for the manufacture of valve sacks, a damaging of the pieces of tube to be conveyed and processed can even be prevented.<br><br>
In order to support a secure holding of the object onto the conveyor in a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention at least one of the elements has a surface on its side turned toward the conveyor with a friction coefficient which is lower than the friction coefficient of the conveyor. In this way the object is taken along through the conveyor while it is guided along on the element. The element's and the conveyor's friction coefficient can be impacted both by means of a suitable treating of the surface (polishing, electrical charging), as well as by means of adding suitable substances (lubricants, adhesives or gluing substances)<br>
Preferably the backing run consists of a steel beam.<br>
In order to achieve great magnetic forces a revolving conveyor is designed which has permanent magnets and/or switchable and/or controllable magnets. In such an arrangement the conveyor's and the backing run's components that are attracting each other are very close in location which gives rise to a very strong magnetic attraction. The external influence on the size of the magnetic attraction by switching and/or controlling affords the advantage that the forces can be adjusted to the strength of the objects to be conveyed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the revolving conveyor consists of a conveying belt which has a magnetic coating.<br>
In an additional embodiment at least one magnetic element or one with attractable magnetic forces is arranged on the side of the conveyor branch turned away from the backing run.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to design a beam-shaped magnet bedded in the structure of the machine.<br><br>
5<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the invention has a backing run with at least one additional conveyor. An additional conveyor can become necessary if the object to be conveyed moves in relation to the conveyor due to strong friction between the object and the backing run.<br>
Preferably areas of this additional conveyor contain magnetic or magnetizable materials.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the additional conveyor is a conveying beit coated with a magnetic or magnetizable material or the additional conveyor consists of such a material.<br>
Particularly preferred at the same time is another conveyor which consists of a stsel belt.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a conveyor system pursuant to the state of the art technology. The<br>
conveyor system is broken down into an upper conveyor 1 and a lower conveyor 2 whose continuous conveyor belts 5 are driven by means of drive rollers 3 in a way not explained in any more detail and are directed via guide rollers 4. The lower branch 24 of the upper conveyor 1 and the upper branch 25 of the lower conveyor 2 are turned toward one and other and are compressed by means of compression elements 10. The compression elements 10 contain compression rollers 6, on which the branches of the conveyors 1,2 run. The compression rollers 6 are bedded in spring arms 8 above bed 7. The spring arms 8 are bedded in the machine's framework that is not depicted above torsion springs 9 in a way not shown in any greater detail. The torsion springs 9 at the same time are prestressed so that the compression roller 6 presses with a certain minimal force in each case against the assigned branch 24,25.<br>
In the Figure 2 an invention-related conveyor system is represented that consists of an upper conveyor 11 and a lower conveyor 12. The conveyor belt 13 of the upper conveyor 11 consists of a conveying belt 14 that is equipped with a magnetizable coating 15. In a similar way the conveyor belt 16 of the lower conveyor 12 has a conveying belt 17 that is covered with a magnetic coating. The conveyor belts 13,16 are driven by means of the driving rollers 20 and run over guide rollers 21. The lower branch 24 of the upper conveyor 11 is pulled in the direction of the latter due to the magnetic force emanating from the upper branch 25 of the lower conveyor 12. This attracting force can be compared to sticking behavior. The conveying of a flat workpiece 19 is carried out now thus that this gets stuck in between both of me branches 24 and 25 because the magnetic force of attraction of the upper branch 25 exerts an effect on the lower branch 24 even by means of a flat workpiece 19.<br>
As is apparent from Fig.3 the conveying belt 17 is equipped with a groove 26 on its inner side into which reaches a rail 22 arranged on a guide beam 22. In this way undesirable sideways movements of the conveyor 16 are prevented,<br><br>
7/9<br>
An additional embodiment of the invention will now be illustrated with the aid of Figure 4. In contrast to the conveyor system shown in Figure 2 the conveyor belt 16 of the conveyor shown in Figure 2 merely has anuncoated conveying belt 17. The conveyor 13 consists of a conveying belt 14 equipped with a magnetizable coating 15. Below the upper branch 25 of the lower conveyor 12 a beam-shaped magnet 23 is arranged that exerts a force of attraction on the lower branch 24 of the upper conveyor 11. In this way this branch 24 is drawn against the branch 25 of the lower conveyor turned toward it. If a flat workpiece 19 is located between the branches 24,25, then this again is held stuck by means of the forces affecting the branch 25.<br>
As is shown in Figure 5 even the magnet 23 can have a rail 27 that reaches into the groove 26 made in conveying belt 17 in order to prevent a lateral shifting of the conveying belt 17.<br>
Figure 6 shows a cross section of the conveyor system pursuant to Figure 2 with modified conveyor belts 13, 16. Analogous to Figure 3 the branches 24, 25 from the designated conveyor belts 13,16 can be seen. The conveyor belts 13,16 consist of magnetic material 29 that, e.g., can be ferrous or ferromagnetic. In order increase the rebound resilience of the conveyor belts 13, 16 the magnetic material can be strengthened by means of inserted traction cores 28.<br>
Figure 7 shows a conveyor system with a backing run consisting of a counter-pressure beam 30. This counter-pressure beam 20 is bedded in the machine framework in a way not depicted and is stationary in relation to the conveyor belt 16. Due to the magnetic forces the upper branch 25 of the conveyor 16 lies, besides on the place on the object 19 to be conveyed, on the counter-pressure beam 30. The object to be conveyed is held between the conveyor belt 16 and the counter-pressure beam 30. When conveying the object into one of the two possible conveying directions B it is dragged along by means of the friction imparted by the conveyor belt 16 and slides simultaneously along the counter-pressure beam 30.<br><br>
8/9<br>
Fig. 8 shows the situation shown in Fig 7 in cross section. The object 19 is held between the counter-pressure beam 30 and the upper branch 25 of the conveyor. The conveyor belt 16 consists of a conveying belt 17 and a magnetic coating 18.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a conveyor system that resembles the conveyor system shown in Figure 7. Below the branch 25 of the lower conveyor 12 a beam-shaped magnet 23 is set up. If no object 19 is to be conveyed in the conveyor system the counter-pressure beam 30 lies open on the upper branch 25. As soon as an object 19 is located in the conveyor system the counter-pressure beam 30 can move along the double arrow A in order to adequately clear space for the object 19.<br><br>
