				<td>PURPOSS OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is a new automatic citrus frutt juicing machine used primarily<br>
for juicing oranges. It is smaller then those machines currently on the<br>
market that have a juicing system based on two pairs of rotating male-<br>
female squeezing units or drums. Nevertheless this machine produces the<br>
same yield and furthermore offers a greater degree of hygiene. This<br>
smaller size has been achieved by reducing the number of rotating<br>
squeezing units from four to just two, which consist of one female<br>
squeezing unit and one male squeezing unit. These operate using a novel<br>
turning device - pendulum retaining unit that substitutes the function of the<br>
second pair. The main features ensuring hygiene throughout the entire<br>
machine are a suitable pendulum retaining unit, a ribbed feed opening for<br>
the fruit, a peel collector and an integrated juice container, all of which are<br>
isolated from the outside of the machine.<br>
Currently in the restaurant and hotel industry there exists a wide range of<br>
automatic or semiautomatic citrus fruit juicing machines that employ<br>
different sqyeezing methods. These machines carry out their purpose to<br>
one degree or another. The pioneers of these machines based their juicing<br>
action on the two halves of the fruit that had been previously cut by<br>
pressing them onto a grooved surface which would extract the liquid. An<br>
example of this type of automatic juicing machine is Spanish patent<br>
P8702074 of 1987. This machine would dispense chilled juice after<br>
inserting coins. This machine's juicing system consists of loading the fruit<br>
onto a clamp which moves along a curved enclosure equipped with a blade<br>
so that the two halves of the fruit produced by the cut are submitted to a<br>
ripping action of the pulp by compression and deformation against the<br>
enclosure, thus extracting the juice.<br>
Nevertheless, the problem with these systems is that they destroy the peels<br>
of the fruits when they are dragged across the grooved surface, simitar to<br>
how sandpaper works. Such action leads to albedo fluids and essential oils<br>
from the peels mixing with the extracted juice. Furthermore, a significant<br>
part of the juice is retained by the unwanted pulp. The end result is a loss<br>
in yield and a low quality juice.<br>
Later machines, such as the model registered as U9602180, squeezed the<br>
entire fruit by compressing it against a plate that was pushed downward by<br>
an actuating cylinder acting as a piston. The fruit was squeezed against the<br>
surface of a vessel or container which had the dual purpose of holding the<br>
fruit during squeezing and of collecting the juice that had been extracted.<br>
In this other type of system, the above problem is not solved either.<br>
Although there is no violent ripping action against an enclosure or grooved<br>
surface, the force of compression against the orange itself aiso affects its<br>
peel which is squeezed atong with the rest of the fruit.<br>
Since this was a known problem, more sophisticated systems began to be<br>
developed in which the juicing action on the fruits would not affect the<br>
peels. This is to say that the goal was to create a machine in which the<br>
waste created would be the entire peel, free of pulp and juice.<br>
One solution was the use of suction in the juicing systems. One example of<br>
such a machine is the model registered under U9900512. This machine has<br>
a system based on a drum with a series of cavities. Each cavity allows the<br>
fruit encased within it to be cut in half by a blade moving atong the<br>
perimeter of the drum. The halves are then subjected to a suction process<br>
by an arm with a male perforating end which, by compression, acts upon<br>
the half of the fruit encased in the cavity of the female drum. Ail of this<br>
occurs without coming into contact with the peel; the juice is extracted by<br>
the male perferating part with a suction pump and passes through a conduit<br>
designed especially for this function.<br>
Nevertheless, these systems are not free of problems either. The sucking<br>
action does not achieve a complete extraction of the juice and afterwards<br>
the juice must be put through filtering systems and separators for the air<br>
and pulp carried within the juice. Additionally, the juice often contains<br>
impurities and suspended particles.<br>
Among the range of citrus fruit juicing machine systems on the market<br>
today, the One which is clearly the best and most common because it<br>
effectively addresses the problems mentioned above, as well as producing a<br>
high yield, is the system in the two machines patented by the company that<br>
is currently applying for the new patent presented here.<br>
The known juicing system of these machines (Spanish patents with<br>
application numbers P6800970 and P9101254) is based on a set of two<br>
pairs of rotating cylinders or drums, the upper two of which are female and<br>
equipped with four semispherical cavities and two lower male drums. The<br>
male drums have three finished arms with bell-shaped heads. When a<br>
piece of fruit falls into a cavity of the female drum, the opposing rotational<br>
movement of the drum adjacent to the fruit is retained and moved between<br>
both towards the blade located below, which cuts the fruit into two halves.<br>
Immediately alter leaving the base of the blade, which is angled above the<br>
fruit, each naif will be squeezed by the corresponding arms of the two male<br>
drums which embed themselves into each half resulting in a complete and<br>
clean extraction of the juice. After the extraction, the juice passes through<br>
a filter and is collected into a container while the peels pressed against the<br>
male pieces will fall into a collecting bin with the help of an extracting<br>
wedge.<br>
Currently this is the best serial juicing system. It is hygienic, economic,<br>
offers high yield, and is suitable for bars, cafeterias, schools, hospitals and<br>
the like. Nevertheless, as the units based on this system resuine four<br>
drums or cylinders, their frames will be of considerable size and take up<br>
much space in these businesses. These businesses do not always have a lot<br>
of space which may negatively influence their decisions regarding the<br>
installation of these machines. The reality of the situation is that the<br>
current market lacks small automatic machines made for the hotel and<br>
restaurant industry (household use is a different matter where practically<br>
the entire process is manual, barring the squeezing step). This is especially<br>
true for automatic machines with the same features that the male and<br>
female rotating drum system uses. For example, there is a patented<br>
reduced size machine (application P9800682) that uses a compression<br>
based juicing system. It has a drum equipped with a blade and<br>
compression blade that cuts the fruit and immediately squeezes it against<br>
its sides. Nevertheless, this system poses the problems mentioned above:<br>
excess pulp with residual juice and fluids from the peels that mix into the<br>
extracted juice.<br>
There is a smaller machine in existence that has been patented which uses<br>
a system inspired by the rnaie-female rotating drum idea. The inventor has<br>
managed to reduce its size by replacing the second pair of drums with a<br>
fruit carrier that occupies the space that a third cylinder would have taken<br>
up. Thus, disappointingly, the size of the machine is reduced only<br>
minimally.<br>
The ideal situation would be to have a machine with the same level of<br>
operability as those with two pairs of mate-female drums, but with only one<br>
such pair of drums. This means that there would be only one rotating male<br>
drum and only one rotating female drum. Such a system would be possible<br>
If the machine integrated a complementary system which would effectively<br>
provide the functionality of the second pair of drums. In this way, the size<br>
of he machine would be reduced to almost half and offer the same yield.<br>
This is precisely what the invention in question offers. It is an automatic<br>
juicing machine for oranges and similar fruits that has a juicing system<br>
based on a set of male-female rotating drums. This machine has a gravity<br>
feed ramp, a casing with a protective front cover that encloses the frame<br>
that supports the ramp and serves as a support for the motor and other<br>
mechanisms and parts. Among the more important of these include the<br>
cutting blade, the male and female rotating drums with their corresponding<br>
cavities and arms used for holding, guiding and squeezing the fruit, the<br>
filter, the base where juice and peels are collected and the peei extracting<br>
wedge.<br>
The essential characteristic of this machine is that it has one sole male and<br>
one sole female drum. This reduces the size of the machine considerably.<br>
This system employs one retainer pendulum with the dual function of<br>
allowing the fruits to retch the female drum at the right moment and of<br>
holding them secure to allow cutting by the automatically positioned blade.<br>
This blade, together with a triangular cutting part guides the haif of the fruit<br>
retained in the cavity of the female drum until it comes into contact with an<br>
arm of the male drum which then squeezes the fruit due to its rotating<br>
action. This together with the retaining pendulum is the essence of the<br>
system that has eliminated the need for having a second set of drums. The<br>
remaining helf of the fruit after the cut will turn into the proper position in<br>
order to sit in a cavity of the female drum at the same time. Its upward<br>
movement opens the way for a new fruit which falls into the next free<br>
cavity, thus starting the squeezing sequence over again.<br>
The system further incorporates a feeder with a fruit detection system that<br>
allows the machine to start automatically and prevents jamming. The<br>
machine has a fruit counting system, a peei collector, an anti-drip tray and<br>
an integrated juice container at the base of the machine which, together<br>
with a deck equipped with a guiding wing, isolate the juice from<br>
contaminating particles and extraneous material.<br>
With the male drum - female drum - turning device - retaining pendulum<br>
system described above, the two halves resulting from the cut of each fruit<br>
are squeezed sequentially rather than simultaneously as occurs with prior<br>
juicing machines. In order to achieve this, alt action in the machine is<br>
powered by only one motor with its simultaneous kinematic gear<br>
movement. The motor actuates the male and female rotating drums as well<br>
as a cam positioned at the perimeter which, when rotated, activates and<br>
deactivates a rocker arm and guided counterweight, thus raising and<br>
lowering the rotating piece. The result of this is the positioning of the fruit<br>
into an upper cavity of the female drum, and at the same time pushes the<br>
retaining pendulum. This in turn actuates the dispenser allowing the next<br>
fruit to enter the system. The upward movement of the turning device is<br>
caused by the guided counterweight and the downward movement by the<br>
cam-actuated rocker arm. Both transfers in both rotor directions are guided<br>
by flexible belts for preventing possible tearing from imperfect processing.<br>
The blade is integrated into the turning shaft and thus is synchronized and<br>
automatical positioned with the female drum in preparation for the cut.<br>
The Wade is straight with the cut starting in the center at a slight angle so<br>
that the two halves of the fruit will be virtually the same size. The blade<br>
has the dual purpose of both cutting the fruit and, together with the<br>
triangular cutting piece located below it, guiding the half towards the arm of<br>
the mate drum.<br>
The female drum has deeper cavities than those in previous machines.<br>
These deeper cavities more effectively surround and secure the half of the<br>
fruit thus Increasing the yield of the juicing process and reducing splatter.<br>
Furthermore, the machine has an undercutting operability which allows the<br>
blade to give a totter and cleaner cut. The mate drum has an opening in the<br>
center of the shells so that the lever of the extracting wedge can pass<br>
through, thus allowing the peels to reach the storage container.<br>
The frame of the machine consists of a single plastic die-cast housing piece.<br>
It has a stainless steel front and an "8-shaped" metal bearings support. It<br>
is strong enough to withstand the force of the squeezing process. This is<br>
one sole part that secures and supports all of the other parts with a<br>
rerouting channel so that the juice will pour into the tray. It also has an<br>
integrated fruit feed system. This differentiates this machine from ail of the<br>
other juicing machines that have open feed systems. This invention<br>
presents the novel idea of a closed system that prevents insects and<br>
contamination from entering, thus offering a greater degree of hygiene.<br>
The feeder has an exterior ramp with two rails for guiding the fruit. The<br>
end of this feeder has a fruit detection system. It further has a housing<br>
with a cylindrical dispenser, a slightly eccentric axis, magnetic clutch and<br>
flexible transmission in the connection with the rocker arm and a ribbed<br>
output aperture towards the female drum which isolates the juicing area<br>
from the outside.<br>
The fruit detection system allows the machine to start automatically and<br>
count the number of pieces of fruit. It turns every one of these, thus<br>
preventing jamming ami stops the machine when no more oranges are<br>
ready to be juiced. The frame of the machine has an opening at the height<br>
of the peel extracting wedge so that the peels will fall into the peei collector.<br>
The surface above from where the juice falls has a flange and a slope that is<br>
adequate for good circulation from the tray. An anti-drip system and<br>
collecting container are integrated into the tray.<br>
The lower base support of the machine has a U-shaped perimeter which<br>
houses a lost liquid collecting tray. The lower part of this flange is equipped<br>
with a grip strip which is located between the machine and the bar or table<br>
where the machine rests, thus preventing contamination and unwanted<br>
materials from entering. In addition, the base has integrated handles which<br>
makes moving the machine easy.<br>
The custom peel collector that is integrated into the machine has a marked<br>
removal area in its lower part which coincides with the U-shaped flange of<br>
the perimeter along the base. This allows for the controlled removal of the<br>
tray without using any tools and allows it to easily adapted for backers or<br>
for using a peel collecting bin. It also has a peel deflector, which is a ramp<br>
that distributes the peels more evenly as they fat) so that the space is better<br>
used. They are guided towards the mouth of the output aperture in the<br>
case that the collector is used with its perforated base.<br>
The juice tray has an anti-drip device with a spigot and may be actuated<br>
automatically by positioning the container on its lower part (when the<br>
container is positioned here the system is actuated and when it is removed<br>
it ceases its activity). The device can also be used manually by using the<br>
hand for actuation. The anti-drip has a control button mechanism that<br>
when pressed causes the piston to move downward thus allowing the liquid<br>
to begin flowing. The peel collector and the juice container are parts which<br>
are integrated into the design of the machine and isolated from<br>
contaminating particles and extraneous substances. This is a novelty in<br>
juicing machines used in the hotel and restaurant business. It is also a<br>
novelty in thet there is the dual possibility of actuating the anti-drip spigot<br>
both manually and automatically by positioning a container at the proper<br>
place.<br>
The cover of the machine is made up of two parts, one of which is<br>
translucent and the other transparent. This cover gives the machine a<br>
novel appearance in that in its lower part there is a wing that routs the juice<br>
to the tray. The cover prevents dripping even when it is open.<br>
All of these novelties that this invention offers means that its overall<br>
advantage is that its performance is as good as any machine currently<br>
offered on the market that uses two pairs of rotating male and female<br>
drums but with a much smaller size. This advantage makes it especially<br>
attractive for hotels and restaurants that do not have a lot of available<br>
space.<br>
Additionally, the system has the same high standard of hygiene as it does<br>
for its operability. This is not just because the retaining pendulum prevents<br>
contact between the peel and rotating piece during the cut (which encases<br>
one of the two halves of the fruit on the pulp side) but also because of the ribbed<br>
opening of the feeder, which isolates the inside of the machine and prevents<br>
contamination and insects from entering. Further, this high standard is a result of the<br>
peel collector and juice container being integrated into the base, both of which close off<br>
access of extraneous material.<br>
In order to have the make-up and operation of the reduced size juicing machine under<br>
consideration more clearly understood an example of its operation is offered below along<br>
with an explanation of important details based on the accompanying drawing where :<br>

Figure 9 shows the geometrical section of one of the shaft ends (28) where<br>
at a certain height the edges have grooves (29) that sustain certain<br>
protuberances (35) in the inside area of the closing device (30) which<br>
leaves this part set as the butt of the shaft.<br>
Figure 10 shows the machine with the cover open (33) where the lost liquid<br>
collecting tray (31) is set in its operational position, the rupture area of the<br>
peel coilector (21) and the handles (32) that are latecreated into base<br>
Other pieces that can be seen in the interior part of the cover include the<br>
routing wing (34) that routes the juice to the tray.<br>
The juicing machine has a frame that serves as its skeleton. This frame<br>
supports the feed ramp, the motor and the different mechanisms and parts.<br>
Among the more outstanding novel parts are the rerouter (20) for the<br>
excess juice that falls to the tray and the fruit detection system (21).<br>
The back part of the frame has the mechanisms that allow the operation of<br>
the parts that carry out the juicing process, which are located between the<br>
front of the machine and the protective cover.<br>
The control system consists of an operations button that includes ail of the<br>
functions, integrated detectors in the circuitry and a display that gives<br>
informational messages. The latter of these is a novelty in juicing machines<br>
for hotels and restaurants.<br>
The machine has automatic multivoltage electrical power which allows it to<br>
be connected in any part of the world without art adapter, which also is a<br>
novelty. Additionally, the machine has a socket for autonomous alternating<br>
24 V current which allows it to work on battery power.<br>
A feed ramp (1) is located in the frame which holds the fruits which will fall<br>
into the juicing system, one by one, due to the force of gravity, while the<br>
dispenser (15) allows them to pass. When this system at the end of the<br>
feeder receives the first piece of fruit, the rocker arm and magnetic grip are<br>
actuated by the clutch magnets, which may be either mono or multipolar;<br>
this changes position of the dispenser by turning around its shaft and<br>
prevents the second piece from entering. Meanwhile the first piece exits<br>
towards the interior of the machine through the ribbed opening (16) which<br>
is opened dye to the turning action of the dispenser and is then deposited<br>
into the corresponding cavity of the female drum.<br>
The juicing system is composed of one sole female rotating drum (3) with<br>
several cavities and one sole male rotating drum (5) with several arms with<br>
ball shaped ends. Replacing the action of the second pair of drums is a<br>
turning device (6) that operates in combination with the retaining pendulum<br>
(2).<br>
The shafts of the drums have a fast shutdown and do not need threaded<br>
parts. These are seated with a special customized retaining piece. It is<br>
easy to set up and clean since the geometry of the retainer prevents small<br>
angles. Once the fruit is encased in the first cavity of the female drum (3)<br>
that it encounters alter falling from the feeder, the clockwise rotating<br>
movement guides it towards the cutting blade (4) where it is cut into two<br>
halves. During this process the pendulum (2) secures the fruit on the side<br>
opposite the drum which results in a symmetrical cut. Once the fruit has<br>
been cut, one of the two halves remains in the cavity of the rotating female<br>
drum (3) where It is moved with the help of the base part of the cutting<br>
blade (4) which prevents it from falling out. The half then comes into<br>
contact with one of the arms of the male rotating drum (5) which is rotating<br>
in the opposite direction thus squeezing the fruit half that is secured in the<br>
cavity of thefemale drum. The Juice is squeezed out by plugging the end of<br>
the male drum's arm into the cavity with a cupping action. The other half of<br>
the fruit is petitioned into the turning device (6) on its pulp side and at the<br>
right moment (when the rocker arm is freed up by the cam) it is turned into<br>
the following upper cavity of the female drum, being turned just enough to<br>
be properly placed into the cavity.<br>
As the half is being raised, the turning device (6) pushes the retaining<br>
pendulum (2) and allows a new fruit to enter into the system by falling into<br>
the free cavity of the rotating female drum, therefore the sequence to start<br>
over again.<br>
Thus, the pendulum has a dual purpose in this new machine: it allows fruits<br>
to pass into the system once the juicing sequence base begun, and secondly<br>
it secures the fruits so that they will be cut correctly, ensuring that the fruit<br>
does not came into contact with the turning device so that it will remain<br>
dean.<br>
The two helves of the fruit are squeezed sequentially due to the action of<br>
the male and female drums. The juice is extracted into the tray, which is<br>
equipped with a filter in order to prevent seeds and large pieces of pulp<br>
from remaining in the juice.<br>
If the juice collecting container is attached to the anti-drip device, it<br>
remains in the open position and the juice is directly collected into the<br>
container that is located at the base of the machine and below the tray.<br>
When the container is removed, the anti-chip device is automatically closed.<br>
This device may also be actuated manually by simpiy pressing its control<br>
button (24).<br>
The extracting wedge, which is a flap that passes through the center<br>
opening (9) of the she to of the male drum, removes the peels adhering to it<br>
into the peel collecting container.<br>
The shafts of the male and fiemaie drums on their free ends have a<br>
geometrical shape. The edges of these ends have a series of grooves that,<br>
when the butt is Inserted into one of them, they are secured by adhering to<br>
these groves since these butts have protuberances on their internal face.<br>
This avoids having to use nuts and makes setting up and taking apart the<br>
drums easier, which in turn makes cleaning easier.<br>
We claim:<br>
1. A reduced size juicing machine for fruits comprising a gravity feed based<br>
feeding ramp (1); a housing with a protective front cover adapted to enclose<br>

when it is being cut by the blade(4), which together with the triangular<br>
section piece supporting the turning device(6),guides the half of the fruit<br>
retained in the cavity of the female drum to an arm of the male drum in order<br>
to extract the juice ; and turning device (6), together with the retaining<br>
pendulum(2) providing for a system free of any second set of drums; a feeder<br>
with a fruit detector integrated into the frame to allow the machine to<br>
automatically start, count the pieces of fruit and prevent jamming; a peel<br>
collector; an anti-drip device; a customized juice container which is integrated<br>
into the base of the machine such that together with the guiding wing of the<br>
cover(34), the same isolates the juice from contaminating particles and<br>
extraneous elements.<br>
2. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in claim 1, wherein said<br>
machine by its turning system (6) and retaining pendulum (2) are adapted to<br>
be actuated by said motor in the machine and the movement is distributed<br>
through gears means (10) which operate simultaneously the two rotating<br>
drums, one of which is female (3) and the other male (5) and a perimeter<br>
cam (10) which, when rotating, cause a rocker arm (11) to operate and stop<br>
operating as well as a guided counterweight (12), which in turn causes the<br>
downward and upward movement of the turning device to occur using flexible<br>
belts (13), the said turning device adapted to rotate the half of the fruit and<br>
then properly places this half into the highest open cavity, at the same time<br>
the same pushes the retaining pendulum and actuates the dispenser part of<br>
the feeder and frees the way for a new fruit to fall into the next free cavity of<br>
the female drum in order to continue the juicing sequence.<br>
3. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in anyone of claims 1 or 2,<br>
wherein its cutting blade (4) is automatically positioned such that the two<br>
resulting halves from the cut are practically of the same size and that,<br>
together with the triangular support piece of the turning device, guides the<br>
half to the male drum, thus preventing it from falling.<br>
4. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in anyone of claims 1 or 2,<br>
wherein the female drum is provided with cavities deep enough to allow the<br>
fruit to be seated perfectly into them and also provided with recesses (17)<br>
that surround the table.<br>
5. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2,<br>
comprising a single piece housing which constitutes the frame and has a fruit<br>
detection system (19) integrated into it as the final stage in the feed, two<br>
guide rails (14), a cylindrical dispenser (15) with a slightly eccentric shaft,<br>
magnetic clutch and flexible transmission in operative connection with the<br>
rocker arm and ribbed opening (16) such that the fruits passes towards the<br>
female drum.<br>
6. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in anyone of claims 1 or 2,<br>
wherein the base (7) integrates the peel collector, the juice tray and the juice<br>
collecting container, with a final U-shaped support part with an inclined upper<br>
surface that allows any lost liquid to pour into a collecting tray and has a<br>
perimeter edge on its lower side which is configured with a sealing strip on<br>
the supporting service, adapted to coupling cavities for installing legs and a<br>
securing closing plate that serves the posterior part of the base preferably U-<br>
shaped for adding handles.<br>
7. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in anyone of claims 1, 2 and<br>
6 wherein the peel collector (9) has a premarked rupture area (21) in its<br>
lower part, and a ramp (2) adapted to deflect peels towards the exit aperture<br>
in the event of perforation.<br>
8. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in anyone of claims 1, 2 and<br>
6, wherein the juice tray (22) integrates an anti-drip device (23), which is<br>
actuated automatically by placing a container in its lower part, or manually by<br>
pushing a control button (24) which causes a piston to move downward<br>
allowing the liquid to flow freely.<br>
9. A reduced size fruit juicing machine, as claimed in anyone of claims 1, 2 and<br>

This invention is a reduced size citrus fruit juicing machine that uses sets of rotating<br>
male female drums characterized by having one sole female drum and on sole male<br>
drum with an automatically positioning blade and a retaining pendulum - turning device.<br>
These characteristics avoid having to incorporate a second set of drums into the machine<br>
since the remaining half of the fruit is turned after the cut into the following upper cavity<br>
of the female drum. In addition to maintaining the performance of similar machines of<br>
greater size, it improves hygiene conditions due to an appropriate disposition of the<br>
retaining pendulum, a ribbed opening for the fruit, a peel collector and an integrated<br>
customized juice container which are isolated from the outside, all of which make it<br>
especially attractive to hotels and restaurants that do not have much available space.</td>
