Formula 1 U.S. Patent No. 4,536,518 ("the '518 patent") describes the preparation of Sertraline hydrochloride with a melting point of 243-245° C by treating an ethyl acetate/ether solution of the free base with gaseous hydrogen chloride. The solid state properties of the Sertraline hydrochloride so produced are not otherwise disclosed.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,734,083 describes the preparation of a form of Sertraline hydrochloride denominated polymorph "Tl."<br>
2<br><br>
According to U.S. Patent No. 5,248,699 ("the '699 patent"), the Sertraline hydrochloride produced by the method of the '518 patent has a crystalline form denominated "Form II." The '699 patent discloses four other polymorphs of Sertraline hydrochloride designated Forms I, III, IV, and V, and characterizes them by single crystal x-ray analysis, powder x-ray diffraction, infra-red spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The '699 patent reports that Form II is produced by rapid crystallization of Sertraline hydrochloride from an organic solvent, including isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate or hexane, and generally describes methods for making Sertraline hydrochloride Forms I-V. According to this patent, the preferential formation of Forms I, II or IV in an acidic solution consisting of isopropyl alcohol, hexane, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, glacial acetic acid or, preferably, ethyl acetate, depends on the rapidity of crystallization. The only method described in this patent for making Forms II and IV is by the rapid crystallization of sertraline hydrochloride from an organic solvent such as those listed above.<br>

US patent application 20030055112 describes forms II, III, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X of Sertraline hydrochloride and novel methods for their preparation. According to the present invention, Sertraline hydrochloride polymorph II may be produced by slurrying sertraline hydrochloride polymorph VI in aprotic organic solvent.

Sertraline base is dissolved in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include ethyl acetate, toluene, acetone, t-methyl-butyl ether, hexane and cyclohexane, and mixtures thereof. The pH of the Sertraline base solution is lowered by the addition of glacial acetic acid to precipitate Sertraline acetate. The most preferred solvents are n-hexane and toluene.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, Sertraline acetate is suspended / dissolved in suitable solvents and hydrogen chloride is added to convert the Sertraline acetate into Sertraline hydrochloride.<br>
Hydrogen chloride used may be added as a gas or a solution with an organic solvent, such as a solution of isopropyl alcohol and hydrogen chloride, n-butanol and hydrogen chloride, acetone and hydrogen chloride, or the like.<br>

5<br><br>
from 30°C to 80°C, hydrogen chloride is added to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to between 1 to 2. The addition of hydrogen chloride to Sertraline acetate in suitable solvents is exothermic and the temperature rises from ambient to 60°C - 65°C. The mixture is then cooled gradually to 25°C within 3 hours, with no external cooling provided. The product so obtained is isolated and dried at about 80°C under vacuum to give Sertraline hydrochloride form II.<br>
The most preferred solvent for making Sertraline hydrochloride form II is a mixture of isopropanol and toluene. The solvents are preferably taken in ratios ranging from 1% to 95% toluene. The more preferred ratio being in the range of 2 - 8% toluene. The most preferred ratio being 3% - 5% of toluene in isopropanol.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of this invention to make Sertaline hydrochloride form III, Sertraline acetate is suspended/ dissolved in suitable solvents such as isopropanol, toluene, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate or mixtures thereof at ambient to elevated temperatures ranging from 30°C to 80°C, hydrogen chloride is added to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to between 1 to 2. The addition of hydrogen chloride to Sertraline acetate in suitable solvents is exothermic and the temperature rises from ambient to 60°C - 65°C. The mixture is then cooled rapidly with aid of an ice bath and the temperature is brought down to 15°C to 18°C with in 20 minutes. The product so obtained is isolated by filtration and dried at about 80°C under vacuum to give Sertraline hydrochloride form III.<br>
The most preferred solvent for making Sertraline hydrochloride form III is a mixture of isopropanol and toluene. The solvents are preferably taken in ratios ranging from 1% to 95% toluene. The more preferred ratio being in the range of 2 - 8% toluene. The most preferred ratio being 3% - 5% of toluene in isopropanol.<br>

The addition of hydrogen chloride to Sertraline acetate in suitable solvents is exothermic and<br>
6<br><br>
the temperature rises from ambient to 60°C - 65°C. The mixture is then cooled rapidly with aid of an ice bath and the temperature is brought down to 15°C to 18°C within 30 minutes. The product so obtained is isolated and dried at 60°C in a fluid bed drier to give Sertraline hydrochloride form IV.<br>
The most preferred solvent for making Sertraline hydrochloride form IV is isopropanol<br>
In another preferred embodiment of this invention to make Sertaline hydrochloride form V, Sertraline acetate is suspended / dissolved in water at room temperature, filtered to get clear solution and hydrochloric acid is added to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to between 1 to 2. The mixture is stirred at about 25°C for 2 hours. The product so obtained is isolated and dried at 60° C under vacuum to give Sertraline hydrochloride form V.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of this invention to make Sertaline hydrochloride form V, Sertraline base is dissolved in acetic acid at room temperature and stirred to obtain clear solution, to which water is added as a diluent under stirring for 20 minutes at room temperature, 25°C. The said clear solution is cooled to 5-10°C and stirred for 1 hour, followed by addition of concentrated hydrogen chloride to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to between 1 to 2 and maintained the reaction mixture at same temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred for 15 minutes to precipitate the product; the reaction is further diluted with water before isolation of the product. The product so obtained is isolated and dried at 65 °C in a fluid bed drier to give Sertraline hydrochloride form V.<br>
