				<td>THE APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING A MULTIORIFICE METAL PLATE NET SKELETON REINFORCED PLASTIC COMPOSITE TUBING<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for producing a multiorifice metal plate net skeleton reinforced plastic composite tubing.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The prior apparatus for producing plastic tubing comprises a plastic extruder, a tubing forming chamber, a vacuum sizing machine, a cooling box, a traction engine, a cutting machine and a tubing overturner, which only can produce common plastic tubing resistant to corrosion, but can not produce multiorifice metal plate net skeleton reinforced plastic composite tubing for resisting corrosion as well as suffering high pressure.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In view of the above reasons, an object of the invention is to provide an apparatus for producing a multiorifice metal plate net skeleton reinforced plastic composite tubing with light weight, corrosion resistance, high pressure-resistant strength, rust and scale resistance.<br>
In order to attain the above-mentioned objects, the apparatus according to the present invention comprises a frame; a forming mechanism on said frame for rolling the multiorifice metal plate to cylindrical skeleton, which comprises at least a group of a forming frame and /or a forming sleeve having at least a pair of forming wheels; a sizing mechanism to size said cylindrical skeleton, which comprises at least a group of a sizing frame and /or a sizing sleeve having at least a pair of sizing wheels; and a welder for fusion said<br><br>
sized cylindrical skeleton by seam welding; said apparatus also includes at least a composite die which has a die sleeve with an inlet of the sprue for the plastic melt and allows the skeleton through to be combined to form a plastic tubing. The number, which may be one group or more groups, of said forming frame, forming sleeve, sizing frame and sizing sleeve depends on actual demands. The number of said forming wheels and sizing wheels is also set to be one pairs or more pairs depending on actual demands. Said welder may be gas-protected welder, high-frequency welder or ultrasonic welder etc.<br>
Said composite die also includes a core die extending into said die sleeve. An adjusting sprue loop, a support loop, and an orifice die are disposed within said die sleeve. One end of said adjusting member passes through said die sleeve against said adjusting loop tightly. A die core is disposed within said die sleeve and one end thereof is inserted between said die sleeve and the adjusting sprue loop to form a sprue therein communicating with the inlet of the sprue, and the other end of said die sleeve is joined with a press plate which presses tightly against the end face of said orifice die. A through channel is formed on the support loop to communicate the sprue with the orifice die (See Figs 1-3). Said adjusting sprue loop may move on the circumferential surface of the die core via an adjusting member to change the sprue formed between the adjusting sprue loop and the die core. As a result, the flux of the plastic melt may be adjusted at all points along the<br>
circumference.<br>
I<br>
Said core die comprises a boss to fix and control said multiorifice metal plate net cylindrical skeleton to move stably and linearly. (See Fig. 2)<br>
Said core die is arranged on said forming mechanism. (See Fig. I)<br><br>
Said support loop is provided on its inner circumferential surface with a plurality of support blocks between which a through channel communicating said sprue with the orifice die is formed (See Fig.2). The support blocks also support the multiorifice metal plate net skeleton to keep its shape when the molten plastics is extruded, and allow the plastic melt to flow into said orifice die through the sprue and the through channel so as to form an inner and outer plastic layers of tubing. It is advantageous for forming the tubing to control the speed of the inner and outer plastic walls to be in consistent with those of the skeleton and the inner plastic by adjusting the cross area of the sprue.<br>
The forming wheels of the forming frame and the sizing wheels of the sizing frame may be connected to an electromotor by a decelerator (See Fig. 1 and 2).<br>
Referring to Fig.l and 2, said apparatus includes a heater fastened on said frame, which may be an electric heater, high-frequency heater or electric air oven, etc.<br>
Referring to Fig.l to Fig.3, while the apparatus according to the invention' is in operation, the forming wheels and sizing wheels are driven to rotate by a drive source, such as an electromotor or a drawer, so as to roll a multiorifice metal plate to cylindrical skeleton with a certain diameter and even commissure. The skeleton is then welded by a welder to be an integral cylindrical skeleton and Simultaneously enter into the die to move stably and linearly under the action of the support blocks disposed in the support loop and the boss disposed in the core die. After entering the sprue through the inlet, the plastic melt flows into the inner and outer layers of the metal plate net cylindrical skeleton to cover the inner and outer layers thereof, respectively, under the action of the on orfice die and core die so as to manufacture a multiorifice metal plate net skeleton reinforced plastic composite tubing. By releasing the press plate, the thickness uniformity of the inner and outer plastic wall may be controlled by adjusting the adjusting sprue loop.<br>
According to the present, the plastic tubing overlaying on the cylindrical skeleton that is made from a multiorifice metal plate as reinforcement, is continually formed into a reinforced composite tubing with advantages of light weight, corrosion resistance, high pressure-resistant strength, scale and rust resistance. The apparatus according to the present invention of simple structure and high efficiencies can produce not only reinforced plastic composite tubing of the same type, but also reinforced plastic composite tubing of the different type.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic structure view of the invention.<br>
Fig.2 is a top view of Fig. 1.<br>
Fig.3 is cross-sectional view along A-A line in Fig.2.<br>
Description of the embodiments<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 to Fig.3, a forming mechanism 2, a sizing mechanism 3, a gas-protected welder 4, a heater 37 and a composite die 5 are mounted on a frame 1.<br>
The forming mechanism 2 includes plural groups of forming frames 6 and a forming sleeve 7 disposed on the frame, wherein each group of forming frames comprises a pair or forming wheels 8 connected to an electromotor 9 via a decelerator.<br>
The sizing mechanism 3 comprises a sizing sleeve 11 and plural groups of sizing frames 10 disposed on the frame, each group of sizing frame 10 include a pair of sizing wheels 12.<br>
A core die 13 connected to the forming frames in the composite die 5 is provided with a boss 14. A die sleeve 16 with an inlet 15 of the sprue comprises an adjusting sprue loop 17, a support loop 18 and an orifice die 19. An adjusting member, such as an adjusting bolt 20 is abutted against tightly the adjusting sprue loop 17 through a heat ring 21 on the outer circumference of the die sleeve 16 and the die sleeve 16. A plurality of support blocks 22 are well-distributed in support loop 18. A through channel 23 is formed between the support blocks 22. A die core 25 with a heat ring 24 on its outer circumference is connected to the die sleeve via a connector, such as a bolt, with one end thereof extending between the die sleeve and the adjusting sprue loop to form a sprue 26 therein communicating with the orifice die by a through channel 23 of the support blocks. A press plate 27 is disposed on and connected with the other end of the die sleeve via some bolts 28 to press the adjusting sprue loop, the support loop and the orifice die against the die sleeve. One end of the adjusting member 29 is tightly abutted against the orifice die through the heat ring 21 and die sleeve 16. After being shaping into a cylindrical skeleton 31, the multiorifice metal plate 30 is then sized by the sizing wheels to be a cylindrical skeleton 32 of a certain diameter and even commissure, which is further welded by a welder to be an integrated cylindrical skeleton 33 and is heated by a heater 37 to pass through the die. The plastic melt extruded by an extruder passes the die core, orifice die and core die to form plastic layers 34 and 35 respectively on the inner surface and outer surface of the cylindrical skeleton 33. Lastly, the inner and outer layers arc integrated by the orifice 36 of the cylindrical skeleton to produce the metal plate net skeleton reinforced plastic composite tubing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
