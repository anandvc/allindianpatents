				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a retractable tail-lift for a vehicle .<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
A retractable tail-lift of this type is disclosed e.g. by the Hydfalt 3<br>
model range of the company Gerd Bar GmbH, Heilbronn.<br>
Tail-lifts are mounted to lorries or trailers for loading and unloading<br>
them. Retractable tail-lifts are mounted to the chassis using a guiding<br>
mechanism and can be retracted completely under the body or<br>
chassis frame after folding the platform once or twice, such that they<br>
do not project at any location to the rear beyond the body to prevent<br>
any disturbance. Retractable tail-lifts of this type are used for<br>
vehicles with interchangeable bodies and for all vehicles which must<br>
dock onto loading/unloading regions of cold storage houses.<br>
In the Hydfalt 3 model range, the guiding mechanism is formed by<br>
two guiding rails in which the lifting mechanism with one vertical<br>
carriage each is suspended, and can be slidably moved between the<br>
working position located behind the vehicle and the driving position<br>
located below the vehicle. Each carriage comprises a front guiding<br>
element with an upper sliding member which abuts on an upper<br>
guiding surface of the guiding rail, and a rear guiding element with a<br>
lower sliding member which abuts on a lower guiding surface of the<br>
guiding rail. The guidance is disposed inside the guiding rails to<br>
protect the guiding surfaces from dirt. The guiding rail may also be<br>
mounted at any location to the vehicle or to cross members, which<br>
facilitates dimensioning of the guiding rail. This technology also<br>
provides maintenance-free sliding guidance if the sliding partners are<br>
appropriately selected. These sliding guidances have the object to<br>
adopt the net weight of the lifting mechanism and the platform and<br>
slidingly transfer it to the guiding element during folding and<br>
unfolding. The guiding elements also have the object to assume<br>
horizontal guidance during forward and backward movement. The<br>
centrally acting displacement cylinder and the irregular friction must<br>
simultaneously provide horizontal guidance. The unfavorable<br><br>
leverages the separation of the guiding elements and the center of<br>
gravity of the tail-lift also produce large horizontal guiding forces.<br>
Since the sliding materials, which consist substantially of plastic<br>
material or plastic composite material, are subjected to wear, the<br>
sliding members of the Hydfalt 3 model range are suspended on the<br>
carriage to obtain even wear. Towards this end, the symmetric<br>
guiding construction has guiding elements of aluminium for the<br>
tension side as well as the pressure side on both sides of the carriage<br>
plate. This guiding elements comprise chambers which are open<br>
towards the bottom for receiving the sliding elements, and are<br>
commonly borne by a specially disposed bolt which penetrates<br>
through the carriage plate. This construction requires relatively high<br>
precision and expensive measures to protect the support and bolt<br>
from rust. Guiding surface is wasted on the pressure side of the<br>
carriage in the region of the carriage plate thickness. With this<br>
construction, the forces are deviated through the bolt into the<br>
carriage plate, thereby producing a very large internal bore surface<br>
which necessitates great material solidity. The carriage plate<br>
thickness must nevertheless be excessively thick. This conventional<br>
construction is therefore technically very demanding and therefore<br>
expensive.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to facilitate<br>
mounting of the guiding elements on the carriage of a retractable<br>
tail-lift.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided a loading platform for a vehicle having<br>
a cable guide.<br>
Servicing of the inventive construction is extremely easy. Changing of<br>
the sliding members is very simple and requires no connecting<br>
means. Removal of the guiding elements, replacing the sliding<br>
members, and reinsertion are facilitated. Faults caused by untrained<br>
staff are almost impossible. The same applies for initial assembly.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further advantages of the invention can be extracted from the<br>
description and the drawings. The features mentioned above and<br>
below may be used individually or in arbitrary combination. The<br>
embodiment shown and described is not to be understood as<br>
exhaustive enumeration but has exemplary character for describing<br>
the invention.<br>

traveling position and in its extended working position;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a carriage which can be displaced in a guiding rail, of<br>

a front guiding element;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a detailed view of the carriage of Fig. 2 in the region of<br>
a rear guiding element; and<br>
Fig. 5 shows a sectional view in accordance with II-II of Fig. 2.<br><br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows the tail-lift in its retracted traveling position, with folded<br>
platform 50, installed on the rear of a trailer 10. The lifting<br>
mechanism 30 with platform 50 is connected to the trailer 10 via<br>
guiding elements 40a, 40b (Fig. 2) in the region FZ and FD using two<br>
guiding rails 21. The center of gravity of the net weight of lifting<br>
mechanism 30 and platform 50 is in the region of FE. This force<br>
generates the tractive force in FZ and the compressive force in FD.<br>
In the working position of the tail-lift, shown in broken view, the net<br>
weight FE and the useful load FN act on the platform 50, which<br>
generate the largest forces in FZ and FD in this case. During<br>
stowage, the lifting mechanism 30 with folded platform 50 is moved<br>
into the traveling position. The support arms and platform 50 remain<br>
below the level of the rubber buffers 26. The platform 50 is<br>
subsequently lifted against the rubber buffers 26 using the lifting<br>
function to clamp the tail-lift. This increases of course the forces<br>
acting in FZ and FD.<br>
Fig. 2 shows part of the support tube 31 with vertical carriage plate<br>
32 in the guiding rail 21 shown with dashed lines. The region FZ<br>
shows the position of the guiding element 40b. In the region FD, the<br>
front guiding element 40a is supported on the recess 32.5 (Fig. 3)<br>
which is open to the top of the carriage 32. In the region FZ, the rear<br>
guiding element 40b penetrates through the carriage 32 in the region<br>
of the opening 32.3 (Fig. 4). In the region FD, the arrangement and<br>
the force transmission are analog to FZ, however, with the<br>
difference, that the recess 32.5 opens to the top.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the front guiding element 40a which consists of the<br>
sliding member carrier 41a and the sliding member 42a which<br>
positively engage each other. The front sliding member carrier 41a is<br>
loosely attached from above onto the plate shaped carriage 32, is<br>
guided thereon in a vertically displaceable manner and is disposed to<br>
be tilted due to sufficient play. Towards this end, the sliding member<br>
carrier 41a has guiding recesses 41.1 on its front end, which extend<br>
over the vertical surface 32.4 of the carriage 32. The force is<br>
transmitted to the sliding member carrier 41a in the region FD via the<br>
radius-shaped abutment surface 32.6 of the recess 32.5 which is<br>
convexly curved (radius R) into the recess 32.5 The forces are<br>
transmitted in a planar manner from the sliding member carrier 41a<br>
to the sliding member 42a and from the sliding member 42a to the<br>
upper sliding path 21.2 (Fig. 5) of the guiding rail 21. The sliding<br>
member carrier 41a, viewed transversely to the guiding direction of<br>
the carriage 32, and the sliding member 42a, viewed in the guiding<br>
direction of the carriage 32, each have a U-shaped cross-section and<br>
positively engage each other over their full surfaces.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the rear guiding element 40b which consists of the<br>
sliding member carrier 41b and the sliding member 42b. The rear<br>
sliding member carrier 41b penetrates through the carriage 32 in the<br>
opening 32.3 which must be sufficiently large to permit mounting of<br>
the sliding member carrier 41b including sliding member 42b. The<br>
rear sliding member carrier 41b is loosely attached from below onto<br>
the plate-shaped carriage 32 and can be displaced thereon in a<br>
vertical direction and can also be tilted due to sufficient play.<br>
Towards this end, the sliding member carrier 41b has guiding<br>
recesses 41.1 on its front end which extend over the vertical surface<br>
32.4 of the carriage 32. The force is transmitted to the sliding<br>
member carrier 41b in the region FZ through the radius-shaped<br>
abutment surface 32.3 of the opening 32.2 which is convexly curved<br>
(radius R) into the opening 32.3. The forces are transmitted in a<br>
planar manner from the sliding member carrier 41b to the sliding<br>
member 42b and from the sliding member 42b to the lower sliding<br>
path 21.1 (Fig. 5) of the guiding rail 21. The sliding member carrier<br>
41b, viewed transversely to the guiding direction of the carriage 32,<br>
and the sliding member 42b, viewed in the guiding direction of the<br>
carriage 32, each have a U-shaped cross-section and positively<br>
engage each other over their full surfaces.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a section through the longitudinal carrier 11 of the<br>
trailer 10, the carriage 32 and the guiding rail 21 in the region<br>
between FZ and FD. It is clearly shown that the guiding elements<br>
40a, 40b guide the carriage 32 via the sliding members 42a, 42b and<br>
the sliding member carrier 41a, 41b in a vertical direction on the<br>
lower sliding path 21.1 and also on the upper sliding path 21.2. The<br>
horizontal guidance is obtained by the vertical surfaces of the sliding<br>
members 42 on the vertical inner surfaces 21.3 of the guiding rail 21.<br>
The horizontal guiding forces are transmitted from the sliding<br>
member 42 to the sliding member carrier 41 through positive<br>
engagement of these two parts. The positive connection of the<br>
guiding elements 40 and the carriage 32 is obtained through positive<br>
engagement of the guiding recesses 41.1 which extend over the<br>
vertical surface 32.4 (Figs. 3,4) of the carriage 32. In the<br>
embodiment shown, the two sliding member carriers 41a, 41b and<br>
their sliding members 42a, 42b have the same design.<br>
This carriage guidance requires a minimum number of components<br>
which cannot be reduced. The laser-cut carriage 32 can be connected<br>
to the support tube 31 through welding. The guiding elements 40 can<br>
be easily inserted due to their positive shape before assembly with<br>
the guiding rail 21. The guiding elements 40 connect the lifting<br>
mechanism 30 and the platform 50 to the guiding mechanism 20.<br>
The sliding member carriers 41 are simple milled parts of normal<br>
constructional steel. The carriage 32 itself is produced from high-<br>
tensile fine-grained steel. The sliding member 42 is connected to the<br>
sliding member carrier 41 also through pure positive locking in all<br>
directions of force without any connecting means. The radius-shaped<br>
surfaces 32.2, 32.6 in the opening 32.3 and in the recess 32.5 ensure<br>
full-surface abutment of the sliding members 42 on the lower sliding<br>
path 21.1. and upper sliding path 21.2 through tilting of the sliding<br>
member carriers 41a, 41b. Even when the sliding members 42 are<br>
worn, uniform surface pressure between sliding member 42 and the<br>
lower sliding path 21.1 and upper sliding path 21.2 is ensured.<br>
If the material has been appropriately selected, e.g. high-tensile fine-<br>
grained steel on the carriage 32 and a relatively soft constructional<br>
steel on the sliding member carrier 41, the material will flow when<br>
the material strength has been exceeded until the surface has<br>
enlarged to a sufficient degree such that the material can adopt the<br>
forces. This process occurs in magnitudes of far less than a millimeter<br>
and therefore has no effect on the function. The same applies for<br>
inaccuracies produced by the support tube 31 and the carriage 32.<br>
Deviations from the right angle in the horizontal plane caused by<br>
production can be compensated for in the same manner.<br>
