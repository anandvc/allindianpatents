METHOD FOR PREPARING RUBBER LATEX Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing rubber latex. Particularly, the present invention relates to a method for preparing rubber latex by emulsion polymerization using a polymerization reactor equipped with a condenser. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for preparing a rubber polymer capable of imparting superior impact resistance, coloring property and gloss to an ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) resin using hard polymer seed from the start of polymerization when monomers condensed by a condenser is fed to the polymerization reactor. Background Art<br>
In accordance with US 4,024,329, polymerization is commenced at a temperature 5 to 10 Â°C below the predetermined polymerization temperature and the temperature in the polymerization reactor is gradually increased to the predetermined polymerization temperature by the reaction heat. In case of overheating due to the reaction heat, the condenser is operated to remove the heat. However, this method is undesirable because the temperature at which the polymerization is commenced greatly affects the polymerization rate, thereby causing irregularities in average particle diameter and quality.<br>
In accordance with JP 2003-206304, the monomer condensate is recycled into the polymerization system when the polymerization conversion reaches 0.01 to 3.4 wt%, considering that intermittent monomer dispersion occurs inside the polymerization reactor when the monomer condensate condensed by the condenser is recycled to the polymerization reactor, thereby destabilizing the polymerization system and interrupting particle stabilization. The condensed monomer is collected at a storage tank.<br>
The method of using hard polymer seed can reduce reaction time and offer superior coloring property and gloss in manufacturing an ABS resin. However, the problem of incomplete shell formation on the seed may arise when the monomer is fed at once. That is, the resultant rubber latex may have a much smaller particle diameter than the object particle diameter.<br><br>
In general, physical properties of an ABS resin are affected by the particle size and structure of rubber latex dispersed in the manufacturing process. Accordingly, it is important prepare rubber latex having a diameter capable of absorbing impact and a structure advantageous in grafting the rubber latex with styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer(SAN) in order to manufacture an ABS resin having superior impact resistance, coloring property and gloss(appearance property).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve these problems and to provide a method for preparing core-shell type rubber latex capable of maximizing grafting ratio of the rubber polymer of a graft copolymer without negatively affecting stabilization of polymerization system and particles, in order to prepare rubber latex having superior impact resistance, coloring property and gloss when applied to manufacture of an ABS resin.<br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Solution<br>
In order to attain the object, the present invention provides a method for preparing rubber latex characterized in that hard polymer seed is fed into a polymerization reactor equipped with a condenser before commencing polymerization and the condenser is operated from the commencing of polymerization, so that the condensate containing conjugated diene compounds can be fed into the polymerization reactor as the polymerization commences.<br>
Hereunder is given a detailed description of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the hard polymer seed is prepared by seed polymerization.<br>
In the seed polymerization, one or more ethylenic unsaturated monomers can be used as monomer.<br>
In the seed polymerization, a graft crosslinking agent or a crosslinking agent may be used in 0.1 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer.<br>
The ethylenic unsaturated monomer may be an aromatic vinyl compound such as styrene and a-methylstyrene or a vinyl cyanide compound such as acrylate, methacrylate and acrylonitrile.<br><br>
For the graft crosslinking agent, allyl methacrylate or triallyl isocyanurate, etc. may be used. For the crosslinking agent, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3-butylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,4-butylene glycol dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene, etc. may be used.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the average particle diameter of the seed fed into the polymerization reactor is preferably between 500 A and 2,000 A, considering the average particle diameter of the rubber latex. If the average particle diameter of the seed exceeds 2,000 A, the amount of the seed required to attain the adequate average particle diameter of the final rubber polymer, that is 2,600 to 5,000 A, increases, so that impact resistance of the resultant ABS resin is reduced. Otherwise, if it is below 500 A, it is difficult to attain the adequate average particle diameter of the final rubber polymer, or 2,600 to 5,000 A. Kind and amount of emulsifier used in the seed polymerization process are determined by considering the adequate average particle diameter of the final rubber polymer.<br>
For the emulsifier, alkyl aryl sulfonate, alkali methyl alkyl sulfate, sulfonated alkyl ester, fatty acid soap, alkali salt of rosin acid, alkali salt of oleic acid, etc. can be used alone or in combination. The emulsifier can be used in 0.1 to 3 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer.<br>
An electrolyte may be used to secure stability during the seed polymerization process. For the electrolyte, KC1, NaCl, KHC03, NaHCO3, K2CO3, Na2CO3, KHSO3, NaHSO3, K4P2O7, Na4P2O7, K3PO4, Na3PO4, K2HPO4, Na2HPO4, etc. may be used alone or in combination. The electrolyte can be used in 0 to 1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer.<br>
In the seed polymerization process, water-soluble persulfate or an oil-soluble polymerization initiator may be used as polymerization initiator. Also, an oxidation-reduction polymerization initiator may be used. Preferable water-soluble persulfates are sodium persulfate and potassium persulfate. Preferable oil-soluble polymerization initiators are cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, azobisisobu-tyronitrile, t-butyl hydroperoxide, p-methane hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, etc. The oil- soluble polymerization initiator may be used alone or in combination and can be used along with<br><br>
the water-soluble persulfate. The polymerization initiator may be used in 0.1 to 3 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the seed prepared in the seed polyme rization process may be used in 10 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer used in the shell rubber polymerization process to be described later.<br>
For the monomer used in the shell rubber polymerization process, an aliphatic conjugated diene compound may be used alone or in combination with an aromatic vinyl compound, such as styrene and a-methylstyrene or a vinyl cyanide compound such as acrylate, methacrylate and acrylonitrile, which are copolymerizable with the aliphatic conjugated diene compound. When used in combination, the aromatic vinyl compound and the vinyl cyanide compound are preferably used in 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the total monomer.<br>
For the aliphatic conjugated diene compound, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, pyperylene, etc. and comonomers thereof may be used. To form a perfect shell layer on the latex prepared by the first seed polymerization process, the kind and amount of the emulsifier to be used in the second shell rubber polymerization process need to be determined carefully. The emulsifier should be used in the range in which stability of the latex is not impaired.<br>
For the emulsifier used in the shell rubber polymerization process, alkyl aryl sulfonate, alkali methyl alkyl sulfate, sulfonateed alkyl ester, fatty acid soap, alkali salt of rosin acid, alkali salt of oleic acid, etc. may be used alone or in combination. The emulsifier may be used in 1 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer used in the shell rubber polymerization process.<br>
For the polymerization initiator of the shell rubber polymerization process, water-soluble persulfate, an oil-soluble polymerization initiator or an oxidation-reduction polymerization initiator may be used. Preferably, the water-soluble persulfate may be sodium persulfate, potassium persulfate, etc. and the oil-soluble polymerization initiator may be cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, azobi-sisobutyronitrile, t-butyl hydroperoxide, p-methane hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, etc. The oil-soluble polymerization initiator may be used alone or in combination or along with a water-soluble persulfate. The polymerization initiator may be used in 0.1 to 3 parts<br><br>
by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer used in the shell rubber polymerization process.<br>
For the electrolyte used in the shell rubber polymerization, KC1, NaCl, KHCO3, NaHC03, K2C03, Na2CO3, KHSO3, NaHSO3, K4P2O7, Na4P2O7, K3PO4, Na3PO4, K2HPO4, Na^HPOa, etc. may be used alone or in combination. The electrolyte may be used in 0.1 to 3 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the monomer used in the shell rubber polymerization process.<br>
In the shell rubber polymerization, mercaptan may be used as molecular weight controller. It may be used in 0.1 to 1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of the total monomer.<br>
Preferably, the final rubber latex obtained by the shell rubber polymerization process has an average particle diameter of 2,600 A to 5,000 A. If the average particle diameter exceeds 5,000 A, excessive coagulum may occur during the polymerization. Otherwise, if it is below 2,600 A, impact resistance at low temperature may be reduced.<br>
The condenser is operated from the start of polymerization. The polymerization is commenced by feeding the monomer condensed by the condenser at the top of the reactor.<br>
Because hard polymer seed is fed before commencing polymerization, the monomer which is condensed by the condenser and circulated as intermittently dispersed is continuously swelled on the stable particulate seed. As a result, a perfect shell layer can be formed and the rubber latex particle may be stabilized. Consequently, a core-shell type rubber polymer capable of maximizing grafting ratio of the rubber polymer of graft copolymer can be prepared.<br>
A method for preparing rubber latex, wherein hard polymer seed is fed into a polymerization reactor equipped with a condenser before commencing poly-merization and the condenser is operated from the start of the polymerization, so that the condensate containing the aliphatic conjugated diene compound which forms the shell of the rubber latex is fed into the polymerization reactor.<br>
