				<td>METHOD FOR THE TIME-AND FREQUENCY-DOMAIN SYCHRONISATION OF MULTIPLE<br>
DEVICES IN A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WITH OFDM MODULATION<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
5 The present invention, as described herein refers to a<br>
process of synchronization in the time and frequency domain<br>
for multiple equipments in a transmission system using OFDM<br>
(orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) modulation.<br>
The objective of this process is to improve the estimation<br>
10 of the start of the OFDM symbols and the estimation of<br>
frequency error in the oscillators in various situations<br>
such as in channels with narrow band noise, frequency<br>
selective channels or channels in which noise power varies<br>
with frequency.        The application of this process to<br>
15 synchronisation also as well as facilitating simultaneous<br>
estimation of frequency error in the analog traslation and<br>
frequency error in the system sample allows said<br>
estimations to be carried out in situations where the<br>
classic synchronisation processes do not achieve results.<br>
20                Furthermore, in cases where it is possible to carry<br>
out various estimations of these factors, the results, in<br>
the form of average or weighted average can be combined to<br>
achieve more accurate estimations with a smaller deviation<br>
from the real value that one wants to estimate.<br>
25                                                 BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
It is necessary to carry out a synchronisation process in<br>
the majority of telecommunication systems so as to<br>
adequately obtain the information transmitted from the<br>
received signals to the channel. One or more types of<br>
30 synchronisation are required depending on how the<br>
transmission is carried out and the modulation used. In<br>
general, to transmit using OFDM modulation it is necessary<br>
to carry out synchronisation in time which consists of<br>
determining the start of the OFDM symbols in reception, and<br>
33 synchronization in frequency, so that frequency of the<br><br>
3<br>
oscillators used for the sample or for the analog<br>
traslation of transmitted and received signal is<br>
sufficiently close.<br>
Many methods of synchronisation of OFDM signals are<br>
5 known in the state of the art but none of these are secure<br>
enough to avoid false indications of synchronisation in<br>
point to multipoint systems in which the electricity<br>
network is the transmission means used.<br>
It is well known that use of the electricity network<br>
10 as a transmission means is problematic for synchronisation<br>
since the connection-disconnection of various apparatus on<br>
the network produces tension peaks and impedance variation<br>
on the line causing channel response to vary in time.<br>
Impulsive noises, which are very usual in the electricity<br>
15 network affect synchronisation, in large part because by<br>
definition these are occasional noises that affect a small<br>
number of samples and therefore can impede adequate<br>
detection of the synchronisation sequences if they coincide<br>
in time with said sequences. Band separation as proposed<br>
20 in this patent, reduces the consequences of these noises so<br>
that it is possible to apply known synchronization methods,<br>
which due to the improvement proposed will offer optimum<br>
results in noisy environments such as the electricity<br>
network.<br>
25               Among the synchronisation methods in the state of the<br>
art those that particularly stand out are described in US<br>
patent No 5732113 which describes a process of time<br>
synchronisation that uses a single synchronisation symbol<br>
with two equal half symbols, and that described in Spanish<br>
30 patent submission 200.101.121 which refers to a "process<br>
for the synchronisation in the down stream of various uses<br>
in a point to multipoint transmission system with OFDM<br>
modulation", and which, describes the transmission of two<br>
identical synchronisation symbols. The present invention<br>
35 improves synchronisation in the time and frequency domains<br><br>
4<br>
due to synchronisation in various bands and achieves<br>
results with less variance and better adjusted to the real<br>
value than that which can be achieved try applying either of<br>
the previously mentioned process.          Furthermore, the<br>
5 application of the method proposed allows synchronisation<br>
to be carried out in many cases where noise on the line and<br>
channel characteristics would prevent the achievement of<br>
any result when using known synchronisation methods.<br>
On the other hand, it is important to indicate that<br>
10 the filter banks such as those described in the book "<br>
Multirate Systems and Filters Baks" , toy P.P, Vaidyanathan,<br>
published by Prentice Hall in 1993, are known but that<br>
these filters have not been used for the division of<br>
synchronisation sequences received for independent<br>
15 detection in frequency bands such as described in this<br>
invention and which achieves the considerable improvement<br>
over the state of the art as described above.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the objectives and avoid the<br>
20 inconveniencies described in previous paragraphs, this<br>
invention consists of a process for synchronisation in the<br>
time and frequency domain for multiple equipments in a<br>
transmission system with OFDM modulation.<br>
This process is applicable to two-way communication<br>
25 applicable to two-way communication over the electricity<br>
network between different equipments connected to the same<br>
electricity network so as to provide an estimation of the<br>
start of the OFDM symbols in reception and the frequency<br>
error of the local oscillators in the equipments, and<br>
30 comprises the generation of synchronisation sequences that<br>
are transmitted over the electricity network. These<br>
synchronisation sequences are sent over the same channel<br>
used for the sending of data, said channel characterised by<br>
a connection between one equipment and all the other<br>
35 equipments. The process is characterized because it<br><br>
5<br>
comprises the decomposition of the received signals made up<br>
of the synchronisation sequences and data in various<br>
frequency bands or ranges. Thereafter, the synchronisation<br>
sequences of each one of the frequency bands is detected by<br>
5 applying a synchronisation algorithm in time that allows<br>
the start of the OFDM symbol and frequency error in the<br>
local oscillators in each frequency band to be estimated,<br>
instead of the complete received signal which is the<br>
conventional method.<br>
10              It is thanks to these characteristics that the process<br>
allows improvement in the estimation of the start of the<br>
OFDM symbols and in the estimation of frequency error in<br>
the oscillators in the equipments is cases where narrow<br>
band noises are present in the channel, that is, ingress<br>
15 noise. In case of transmission over a frequency selective<br>
channel it improves estimation of the start of the OFDM<br>
symbols and it improves frequency error in the case that<br>
the noise power added to the channel by the signal varies<br>
with frequency, that is, in case the channel includes<br>
20 coloured noise. Another of the advantages of this process<br>
is that it permits estimation of sample frequency error,<br>
that increases linearly with frequency and which cannot be<br>
estimated conventionally with the complete signal, and it<br>
improves estimation of frequency error in analog traslation<br>
25 with respect to the use of the complete received signal for<br>
the estimation of same. It also allows simultaneous<br>
estimation of frequency error in analog traslation and<br>
carries out the estimation of the start of the OFDM symbols<br>
as well as calculating frequency error in the sample when<br>
30 detected in two or more frequency bands or ranges including<br>
in cases where use of the complete signal does not produce<br>
a result. Finally, the process in this invention<br>
facilitates improving the results of the estimation of the<br>
start of the OFDM signal and the frequency error in case<br>
35 detection of the synchronisation sequence is achieved in<br><br>
6<br>
more than one frequency band by means of combining the<br>
estimation obtained in each frequency and, by average or<br>
weighted average linear regression.<br>
In the process in this invention break down of the<br>
5 received signal into frequency bands or ranges is carried<br>
out by applying a band pass filter centred in each one of<br>
the frequency bands, a frequency translation in the filtered<br>
signals to work with each band in base band, and<br>
optionally, an decimator to simplify the complexity of the<br>
10 electronics necessary to detect the synchronisation<br>
sequence.<br>
Another way of carrying out this break down is to<br>
filter the synchronisation sequences simultaneously by<br>
means of uniform and decimated DFT (Discreet Fourier<br>
15 Transform) filters with the complexity of a prototype band<br>
pass filter, and a Discreet Fourier Transform (DFT).<br>
In the same way, the breakdown or the synchronisation<br>
sequences may also be carried out directly by means of a<br>
Discreet Fourier Transform (DPT) circuit.<br>
20                in the process described in this invention, detection<br>
of the synchronisation sequences takes place in each one of<br>
the frequency bands or ranges by means of maximizing the<br>
maximum likelihood known conventionally so that estimation<br>
of the start of the OFDM symbols is carried out from the<br>
25 calculation of the maximum time correlation of the samples<br>
in each band, and this maximum becomes the mid point in the<br>
flat zone for the correlation peak, whose size in number of<br>
samples is equal to the number of samples of the cyclic<br>
prefix without inter-symbol interference (ISI) , and<br>
30 thereaftfex the angle of this correlation in the moment<br>
determined as maximum correlation is calculated in each one<br>
of the frequency bands so as to achieve an estimate of<br>
frequency error and adjust the oscillators to a common<br>
reference.<br>
35              The correlation maximum is calculated by detecting the<br><br>
7<br>
correlation peaks that surpass a power threshold in each<br>
one of the frequency bands or ranges in the received<br>
signal, and because the value of this threshold is fixed to<br>
minimize the probability of producing false alarms, and<br>
5 the correlation is calculated by means of the following<br>
algorithm:<br><br>
10 and the power is calculated by means of the following<br>
algorithm:<br><br>
15 where ri,d is the signal corresponding to the frequency<br>
corresponding to the i-esima in the moment d, L is the<br>
number of samples in the half symbol. Pi (d) is the<br>
correlation in the band i-esima in the moment d and Ri (d)<br>
power in the band i-esima in the moment d.<br>
20             The calculation of correlation and power is undertaken<br>
iteratively, storing the samples and preferably the partial<br>
products to calculate the correlation and the power by<br>
means of the following algorithms:<br>
25<br><br>
where P, (d) is the correlation in the frequency band<br>
i-esima in the moment d, Ri (d) power in the i-esima band<br>
and in the moment d, and rXXX the signal corresponding to<br>
the i-esima band in the moment x.<br>
30                The moment of detection of the synchronisation<br><br>
8<br>
sequences is taken to be the mid point of the zone that<br>
exceeds 90% of the maximum correlation while delaying an<br>
adequate number of samples to reduce interference between<br>
symbols to a minimum, and the number of samples is<br>
5 adjustable.<br>
On the other hand, because the real part of the<br>
correlation dominates the imaginary part it is possible to<br>
use only the real part of the correlation to simplify the<br>
calculation of the correlation in each frequency band or<br>
10 range if the frequency error is less than a certain<br>
threshold.<br>
To improve the results of the estimation of the start<br>
of the OFDM symbols in each frequency band one can combine<br>
these results as averages or weighted averages so that the<br>
15 final estimate will bw more reliable and with less variance<br>
than that obtained using the complete received signal<br>
without separation in ranges.<br>
Separating frequency bands improves the calculation of<br>
the frequency error in analog traslation by reducing<br>
20 variance when the averages or weighted averages of the<br>
error values calculated in each of the frequency bands is<br>
used.<br>
Furthermore, separating the frequency bands permits<br>
estimation of error in the sample frequency by means of<br>
25 linear regression of the values of the errors obtained in<br>
each band and said error value cannot be estimated<br>
conventionally using the full received signal since the<br>
error in sample frequency increases with frequency.<br>
Finally, and thanks to the separation into bands, the<br>
30 error in analog frequency traslation and the error in<br>
sample frequency can be estimated simultaneously.<br>
On the other hand, the process in this invention may<br>
also be used when coexistence symbols are transmitted,<br>
these are detected in reception by means of band separation<br>
35 and detected in each one of these bands, with the objective<br><br>
9<br>
of allowing the system to recognise if another has<br>
transmitted a certain sequence in the channel or not.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
This section provides a description of an example of<br>
one embodiment of the invention, referencing the numbering<br>
used in the drawings.<br>
25                All communication systems or at least a part of the<br>
communication system such as the synchronization block,<br>
require a minimum signal to noise ratio (SNR) in order to<br>
be able to function, that is, it is necessary that the<br>
received signal has a certain value relative to the noise<br>
30 valus on the line so that the system, can carry out<br>
communication. Minimum ENR cannot reach all the band width<br>
used by the system in communication systems with a<br>
frequency selective channel, or in systems where noise is<br>
dependent on frequency, or in both, due to existing channel<br>
35 attenuation or to the noise level, however it can reach<br><br>
10<br>
some frequency ranges within the total band width. The<br>
process described in this invention takes advantage of this<br>
circumstance to calculate estimates and synchronisation in<br>
such scenarios.<br>
5 Figure 1 shows spectral density of signal power and noise<br>
at the receptor entrance in a certain situation. In this<br>
case, average SNR over the total band is OdB, which is not<br>
enough for communication, but it can be seen that in<br>
certain frequency ranges the power density of the signal is<br>
10 Higher than the noise and therefore in these ranges<br>
communication will be possible. Due to the behaviour of the<br>
channel in such situations classic processes either cannot<br>
achieve synchronisation, or they only achieve it with very<br>
poor quality. This type of channel is very common in<br>
15 systems that use the electricity network as the<br>
transmission medium. The process described in thie<br>
invention undertakes division into various frequency ranges<br>
(by means of filtering in reception) and works on each one<br>
these signal separately. In the majority of situations,<br>
20 synchronisation is necessary to transmit a specific signal<br>
in each one of the frequency bands, and being able to<br>
synchronise in any of the bands improves the results. It<br>
is not enough to transmit an OFDM signal due to a specific<br>
characteristic of this type of modulation whereby<br>
25 multiple carriers once separated can regroup in bands. To<br>
divide the signal into bands a band pass filter centred in<br>
each of the frequency bands can be applied. Furthermore,<br>
the signal must be demodulated to take it to base band and<br>
decimated because if this is not done the frequency in each<br>
30 band will be the same as that in the original signal and<br>
total complexity will be multiplied by the number of bands.<br>
All these operations can be carried out simultaneously and<br>
efficiently using uniform and decimated DTF (discreet<br>
Fourier transform) filter banks, which is a well know<br>
35 process in the state of the art. In this case, the filter<br><br>
11<br>
banks are as complex as a prototype band pass filter (which<br>
as mentioned previously is located in each frequency band)<br>
and it is used with a DFT. This structure can be seen in<br>
Figure 2 where the filters Ei(z) correspond to the poly<br>
5 phase decomposition of the prototype filter where i=o l_M-<br>
1   where M is the number of bands in which the received<br>
signal x(n) is decomposed, l is a sample delay of(z-l) and<br>
2   is a decimator for M. Decomposition of the entry signal<br>
in M frequency bands occurs at the exit to the inverse<br>
10 Fourier transform (IDFT) 3 and each of the frequency bands<br>
ahs a sample frequency M times less that that of the entry<br>
signal. M is also the number of points in the IDFT. From<br>
this point in the system each of the M signals is treated<br>
independently and the estimations are carried out for each<br>
15 one of these bands separately. The complexity is similar<br>
to that obtained on carrying the estimations for the<br>
original signal since we have M signals but the master<br>
frequency for each one has been divided by M. Furthermore,<br>
some of the bands (sub-bands) may be eliminated if they do<br>
20 not contain information and therefore the complexity is<br>
further reduced.<br>
The specifications for the prototype filter depend on<br>
the particular application for which the process described<br>
in this invention will be used. Some examples of such<br>
25 applications include estimation of signal parameters, the<br>
detection of coexistence signals or the detection of<br>
synchronism signa1s.<br>
Another of these applications is synchronisation in<br>
OFDM systems. The majority of synchronisation methods for<br>
30 OFDM signals use the signal in time to carry out this<br>
function and therefore they fail in situations such as that<br>
presented in Figure 1.<br>
It is principally in such cases that use of the<br>
structure presented in Figure 2 can improve the<br>
35 synchronisation. In each of the frequency bands into which<br><br>
12<br>
the signal is divided one may apply any of the methods<br>
described in the state of the art and correct<br>
synchronization in one band is sufficient to begin the<br>
demodulation process in reception., depending on the type of<br>
5 modulation used.<br>
When SNE is high enough so that various band<br>
synchronise then we have various estimations of the start<br>
of the symbol and frequency error simultaneously and<br>
therefore techniques such as combining results to improve<br>
10 the final estimation can be applied.<br>
The result is a method of synchronisation with<br>
diversity in frequency, highly resistant to narrow band<br>
noises, channel selectivity and power noise dependent on<br>
frequency and which can function in typical channels<br>
15 including in those with SNR less that -l0dB over the whole<br>
band. The only requirement needed is that SNR in one of the<br>
frequency bands or ranges are sufficient to detect the<br>
synchronisation signal used in this band.<br>
For example, to obtain optimum results, this process<br>
20 can be applied along with the synchronisation method<br>
described in Spanish patent submission 200.101.121<br>
concerning a "Process for downstream synchronisation of<br>
multiple users in a point to multipoint transmission system<br>
with OFDM modulation" .<br>
25                In this case, the signal to be transmitted is the same<br>
as in said patent, that is to say, two identical<br>
synchronisation symbols, due to the fact that this property<br>
is maintained when the signal is decomposed in the<br>
frequency bands. A structure such as that shown in Figure<br>
30 2 is placed in the receptor and thereafter the power and<br>
correlation metrics are calculated as in the patent<br>
mentioned above except that in this present case, the<br>
limits of all the sums are divided by M where M is the<br>
decimated value of the entry signal, or to put it another<br>
35 way, the number of bands.<br><br>
13<br>
Thanks to the separation of frequency into bands it is<br>
possible to carry out various estimations using only one<br>
synchronisation symbol and it is possible to achieve good<br>
synchronisation results even when using only one<br>
5 synchronisation symbol as a synchronisation sequence.<br>
In this case, the synchronisation sequence is composed<br>
of only one synchronisation symbol divided into two equal <br>
halves. The information transmitted in the carriers used in<br>
the synchronisation symbols may be in fixed or psuedo-<br>
10 random sequence. The odd and even carriers in the OFDM<br>
symbols are set at zero so as to have the symmetry required<br>
in the synchronisation symbols.<br>
The properties of the synchronisation symbol, and more<br>
specifically its symmetry, is maintained when the bands are<br>
15 separated in reception and this allows us to have multiple<br>
synchronisation results which facilitate improving their<br>
precision.<br>
Any other type of synchronisation sequence (in<br>
relation to the number of symbols sent) and the method of<br>
20 detection may use the same method as described previously,<br>
only if the properties of the synchronisation symbol are<br>
maintained when band separation is carried out.<br>
Therefore it is possible to use the following<br>
estimations in each one of the intervals as mentioned in US<br>
25 patent 5732113 "Timing and frequency synchronisation of<br>
OFDM signals" and combine these to obtain estimations with<br>
reduced variance using only one symbol as a synchronisation<br>
sequence:<br>
30<br><br><br>
14<br>
Where ri,d is the exit in the i-esima branch of the filter<br>
band in the moment d, L is the number of samples in the<br>
half symbol divided by M, M is the number of bands that the<br>
signal is divided into, Pi(d) is the correlation of the i-<br>
5 esima branch in the moment d and Ri (d) power in i-esima<br>
branch in the moment d. In a similar way one can continue<br>
to apply the formulae iteratively.<br>
10<br><br>
Once correlation and power have been calculated,<br>
synchronisation is detected as in the patent previously<br>
mentioned, the difference being that now we have various<br>
15 bands that are susceptible to synchronisation. Figure 2<br>
shows a typical case where synchronization is produced when<br>
the calculated power exceeds the correlation threshold. In<br>
the case where various bands synchronize the most<br>
appropriate estimator to use is the average of the<br>
20 estimations of the start of the symbol. It must be stated<br>
that each one of the estimations separately has a<br>
resolution M times less than the global estimate due to the<br>
decimator but variance in the final estimate is better than<br>
in previous methods when using the average.<br>
25                In the same way, sample frequency error may be<br>
calculated from the correlation angle in the optimum moment<br>
in the window, substituting f1 for central frequency in the<br>
band 1 sub-band).<br><br>
30                 Where Ð() is the angle parameter  fi central<br>
frequency in the i-esima band, K the interpolation order or<br><br>
15<br>
decimator and N the number of samples in the OFDM symbol.<br>
Depending an the type of error introduced by the<br>
system in this invention one estimates either, frequency<br>
error on traslation to the analog band, sample frequency<br>
5 error or both. The results obtained in each band are<br>
combined in one way or the other depending on the type of<br>
error that we need to estimate.<br>
In case the system only has frequency error on<br>
traslation to the analog band, the average of the estimates<br>
10 in the different bands can be used as the estimation, as is<br>
shown in Figure 4 (error type 1) since the error is the<br>
same in all bands. However, if what is needed is to<br>
calculate sample frequency error (error type 2), this<br>
process can not be immediately used since the value is not<br>
15 the same in all bands, rather, starting from the origin of<br>
the coordinates it increases with frequency as shown in<br>
Figure 4. A linear regression of the co-relation angles in<br>
each one of tne bands (by means of minimum squares or other<br>
known mathematical methods) is carried out to estimate the<br>
20 slope of this straight line and obtain a better estimation,<br>
and this can be carried out independently of the bands that<br>
are being synchronized. The estimation presented in the<br>
spanish patent submission mentioned previously was reduced<br>
in selective frequency channels, due to the fact that it<br>
25 measured frequency error in the bands that suffered less<br>
attenuation.         With this new method this reduction<br>
disappears since the error in each band is independently<br>
measured, thereby improving the estimation of the error.<br>
The following formulae may be used to estimate this error:<br>
30<br><br><br>
16<br>
Where m is the result of linear regression of the<br>
estimates of the different band and Dfilfs sample frequency<br>
5 error.<br>
Another advantage of the process in this invention is<br>
that it offers the possibility to simultaneously calculate<br>
error in sample frequency and error in translation to the<br>
analog band (error type 3), by carrying out linear<br>
10 regression of the errors measured in each band to calcualte<br>
the slope ( sample frequency error) and the cross over with<br>
tne vertical axis (analog traslation frequency error) as<br>
can be seen in figure 4. Mathematically these values can be<br>
calcualted by:<br>
15<br><br>
20<br><br>
25<br><br>
Where n is the number of estimators used linear<br>
regression, TT is the time of the symtbol with cyclical<br>
prefix and DfiQ is the error in frequency traslation in the<br><br>
17<br>
analog band. Sample frequency error is obtained from m as<br>
in the case where only sample frequency error occurs.<br>
The process in this invention can also be used for<br>
5 coexistence signalling, that is the detection of signals<br>
used to implement a protocol for coexistence of various<br>
technologies over one transmission medium. In these<br>
protocols special signals that all systems must necessarily<br>
be capable of transmitting and receiving are used in order<br>
10 to implement an equitable medium access control, and must<br>
be detected even in conditions of very low SNR. In<br>
transmission media such as the electricity network or radio<br>
there is the added problem that these systems can transmit<br>
simultaneously if attenuation between them is sufficient to<br>
15 have the signals of one arrive at the other below the noise<br>
level, thereby making them undetectable to each other.<br>
Coexistence signals serve to determine if two or more nodes<br>
(equipment that may belong to one or more different<br>
communication systems) may transmit simultaneously,<br>
20 depending on whether the signal of one node is receive by<br>
the other with more or less power than noise for each one<br>
of the frequencies used in the communication.<br>
Using current known methods it is very difficult to<br>
carry out this detection in scenarios such as that<br>
25 presented in Figure 1 and therefore it is convenient to use<br>
the process described in the present invention. In this<br>
case, the best option is to transmit various signals in<br>
different frequencies (the number of frequencies depending<br>
on frequency selectivity in the channel), which are<br>
30 independently detected in reception. Detection of one of<br>
these frequencies is sufficient to determine that one node<br>
is transmitting the coexistence signal. To separate the<br>
different signals the structure shown in Figure 2 is used<br>
in reception.<br>
35                 If the modulation used in one of the systems that must<br><br>
18<br>
coexist is OFDM it is enough that some of the carriers have<br>
sufficient SNR for the demodulation of these a carriers to be<br>
correct thanks to the good behaviour of this type of<br>
modulation in these type of frequency selective channels.<br>
5 It is also possible to carry out detection even when SNR is<br>
average or negative, if the correct, value can be obtained<br>
in one of the ranges in which the received signal has been<br>
divided. If a coexistence signal that occupies full band<br>
width is used to implement coexistence it may give rise to<br>
10 the fact that this signal will not be detected by a node<br>
that uses OFDM modulation and two nodes may simultaneously<br>
occupy the channel causing interference, since the signal<br>
of one will not be lower than the noise level detected in<br>
reception in all frequencies in the second node. According<br>
15 to what is described herein, the process in this invention<br>
solves this problem.<br>
