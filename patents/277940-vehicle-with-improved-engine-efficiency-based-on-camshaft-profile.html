				<td>HIGH OVERLAP CAMSHAFT FOR IMPROVED ENGINE EFFICIENCY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to camshaft profiles, and more<br>
specifically to improving engine efficiency in vehicles based on camshaft profiles<br>
and engine load.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Engine assemblies typically include one or more camshafts that<br>
actuate intake and exhaust valves. Providing an overlap between intake and<br>
exhaust valve opening may provide efficiency gains at partial engine load<br>
conditions and power gains at high engine load conditions. However, the amount<br>
of overlap is limited by low engine load conditions due to combustion stability<br>
concerns, especially at low engine speeds.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] A vehicle may include a drive axle, an engine assembly, a<br>
coupling device, and an engine load management system. The engine assembly<br>
may include an engine block that defines a cylinder, a piston disposed within the<br>
cylinder, a crankshaft rotatably driven by the piston, and a valvetrain including a<br>
fixed-lobe camshaft and intake and exhaust valves supported by the engine<br>
assembly. The intake and exhaust valves may be in communication with the<br>
 <br>
cylinder. The fixed-lobe camshaft may include a first lobe engaged with the<br>
intake valve to open the intake valve and a second lobe engaged with the<br>
exhaust valve to open the exhaust valve. The first and second lobes may be<br>
fixed relative to one another to define a constant valve overlap condition that<br>
provides for opening of the intake valve before the exhaust valve is fully closed.<br>
The duration of the valve overlap condition may create an engine operating<br>
condition that results in combustion instability when the engine is operated below<br>
an engine load limit. The engine load management system may be in<br>
communication with the engine to prevent engine operation below the engine<br>
load limit.<br>
[0005] A method may include providing a valve overlap condition<br>
between intake and exhaust valves for a cylinder of an engine that results in<br>
combustion instability when the engine is operated below an engine load limit. A<br>
vehicle associated with the engine may be operated in a first operating mode<br>
when a load applied to the engine to propel the vehicle is greater than the engine<br>
load limit. The method may further include determining when a load applied to<br>
the engine to propel the vehicle is below the engine load limit and operating the<br>
vehicle in a second operating mode when the load applied to the engine to propel<br>
the vehicle is below the engine load limit. The second operating mode may<br>
include applying a supplemental load to the engine to prevent operation below<br>
the engine load limit.<br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
 <br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>
[0008] Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a vehicle according to the<br>
present disclosure; and<br>
[0009] Figure 2 is a schematic illustration of a camshaft of the vehicle<br>
shown in Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0010] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br>
[0011] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. The vehicle 10 may include an engine assembly 12, an<br>
optional hybrid power assembly 14, a transmission 16, and a drive axle 18. The<br>
engine assembly 12 may include an internal combustion engine 20.<br>
[0012] The engine 20 may include an engine block 24 that defines a<br>
plurality of cylinders 36, a piston 38 disposed within each of the cylinders 36, a<br>
crankshaft 40 in driven engagement with the pistons 38, and a valvetrain<br>
 <br>
assembly 42. The valvetrain assembly 42 may include first and second<br>
camshafts 44, 46 and exhaust and intake valves 48, 50 associated with each of<br>
the cylinders 36. The first and second camshafts 44, 46 may be generally similar<br>
to one another. Therefore, the first camshaft 44 will be discussed with the<br>
understanding that the description applies equally to the second camshaft 46.<br>
While the engine 20 is shown as an overhead cam engine, it is understood that<br>
the present disclosure may additionally apply to other engine configurations such<br>
as cam-in-block engines.<br>
[0013] The first camshaft 44 may include a fixed-lobe camshaft having<br>
exhaust and intake lobes 52, 54 that are fixed for rotation with one another. The<br>
exhaust lobes 52 may be engaged with the exhaust valves 48 and the intake<br>
lobes 54 may be engaged with the intake valves 50 to open the exhaust and<br>
intake valves 48, 50. With reference to Figure 2, the pair of exhaust and intake<br>
lobes 52, 54 for each cylinder 36 may be orientated relative to one another to<br>
provide an overlap between the opening of the exhaust and intake valves 48, 50<br>
for the cylinder 36. For example, the exhaust lobe 52 may have a first peak 56<br>
and the intake lobe 54 may have a second peak 58. The first peak 56 may be<br>
rotationally offset from the the second peak 58 in rotational direction (R) by an<br>
angle (8). The angle (6) may be less than an angle needed to maintain<br>
combustion stability at engine loads below an engine load limit.<br>
[0014] The engine load limit may generally correspond to a light load,<br>
where the overlap between the opening of the exhaust and intake valves 48, 50<br>
may allow recirculation of an unacceptable residual mass fraction from the<br>
 <br>
exhaust gas. The high residual mass fraction may slow down the combustion<br>
process and lead to combustion instability. For example, stationary vehicle,<br>
vehicle coasting, and low-load cruise conditions may correspond to engine loads<br>
required to propel the vehicle 10 that are below the engine load limit. Stationary<br>
vehicle conditions may generally correspond to a normal idle condition for a<br>
vehicle. Engine brake torque values of approximately zero or less may<br>
additionally correspond to engine load conditions below the engine load limit.<br>
[0015] By way of non-limiting example, the hybrid power assembly 14<br>
may prevent engine operation below the engine load limit and may include an<br>
electric motor 62 and a rechargeable battery 64. The electric motor 62 and the<br>
rechargeable battery 64 may form a drive mechanism for the hybrid power<br>
assembly 14. The motor 62 may be in electrical communication with the battery<br>
64 to convert power from the battery 64 to mechanical power. The motor 62 may<br>
additionally be powered by the engine 20 and operated as a generator to provide<br>
power to charge the battery 64. The hybrid power assembly 14 may be<br>
incorporated into and engaged with the transmission 16. The motor 62 may be<br>
coupled to the output shaft 74 to power rotation of the drive axle 18 via the<br>
transmission 16.<br>
[0016] The engine assembly 12 may be coupled to the transmission 16<br>
via a coupling device 72 and may drive the transmission 16. The coupling device<br>
72 may include a friction clutch or a torque converter. The transmission 16 may<br>
use the power provided from the engine 20 and/or the motor 62 to drive the<br>
output shaft 74 and power rotation of the drive axle 18.<br>
 <br>
[0017] In a first operating mode, the crankshaft 40 may drive the output<br>
shaft 74 through combustion within the cylinders 36. In a second operating<br>
mode, the engine 20 may be decoupled from the transmission 16 and the electric<br>
motor 62 may drive the output shaft 74. The engine 20 may be shut off during<br>
the second operating mode. In a third operating mode, the engine 20 may drive<br>
the electric motor 62 to charge the battery 64 and may drive the output shaft 74.<br>
Alternatively, when the battery 64 has a charge level greater than a<br>
predetermined level, a fourth operating mode may be provided where the electric<br>
motor 62 and the engine 20 both drive the output shaft 74. The combination of<br>
the normal engine operating load and the load applied by the electric motor 62<br>
during the third operating mode may provide a total engine load during the third<br>
operating mode that is greater than the engine load limit.<br>
[0018] The exhaust and intake valves 48, 50 may optionally be part of<br>
a cylinder deactivation system (not shown) where the exhaust and intake valves<br>
48, 50 associated with a portion of the cylinders 36 are not operated. The hybrid<br>
power assembly 14 and the cylinder deactivation system may be used in<br>
combination or independently from one another to form an engine load<br>
management system for the vehicle 10. It is understood that the engine load<br>
management system is not limited to the hybrid power assembly 14 or the<br>
cylinder deactivation system and that various alternate load management<br>
mechanisms may be used while remaining within the scope of the present<br>
disclosure. For example, in the engine 20 shown in Figure 1, the exhaust and<br>
intake valves 48, 50 associated with one-half (four) of the cylinders 36 may be<br>
 <br>
inoperable when operated in a cylinder-deactivation mode. The engine 20 may<br>
be operated in the cylinder deactivation mode to increase a net load on the firing<br>
cylinders. The increased net load may be greater than the engine load limit. The<br>
engine assembly 12 may further include cam phasers 60, 61 for the first and<br>
second camshafts 44, 46. The cam phasers 60, 61 may include dual-equal<br>
phasers since the exhaust and intake lobes 52, 54 may be fixed for rotation with<br>
one another. Therefore, when the first and second camshafts 44, 46 are<br>
advanced or retarded, the exhaust and intake lobes 52, 54 move with one<br>
another. Further, it is understood that the teachings of the present disclosure<br>
may apply to concentric camshaft designs as well, where intake and exhaust<br>
lobes are rotatable relative to one another.<br>
[0019] The overlap of the opening of the exhaust and intake valves 48,<br>
50 may increase the power output of the engine 20 when the engine 20 is<br>
operated above the engine load limit at full load conditions. The overlap may<br>
also increase the fuel economy and/or reduce emissions at part load conditions.<br>
The power output, efficiency, and emissions gains may be relative to an engine<br>
having a camshaft with intake and exhaust lobes that provide an opening overlap<br>
that provides combustion stability at engine loads below the engine load limit<br>
discussed above.<br>
[0020] During operation, the engine 20 may either be shut off or may<br>
experience an additional load from the engine load management system during<br>
periods when the engine 20 would typically experience engine loads below the<br>
engine load limit. As discussed above, the engine load management system<br>
 <br>
may include the hybrid power assembly 14 and/or the cylinder deactivation<br>
system. For example, when the engine 20 would typically experience a load that<br>
is less than the engine load limit, an additional load may be applied to the engine<br>
20 by operating the engine 20 in the third operating mode and/or operating the<br>
engine 20 in a cylinder deactivation mode to increase the engine load on the<br>
activated cylinders to a level greater than the engine load limit. Alternatively, the<br>
engine 20 may be shut off during periods when the operating load would be less<br>
than the engine load limit When the engine 20 is shut off, the electric motor 62<br>
may power the vehicle 10.<br>
