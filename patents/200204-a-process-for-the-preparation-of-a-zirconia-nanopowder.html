				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This  invention relates to a process for producing a  transparent<br>
stabilized amorphous ceramic gel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
zircania ZrO  exists in three monoclinic (m), tetragonal (t)  and 2<br>
o cubic (c) polymorphism m-ZrO  transforms to t-phsse at 1170 C and<br>
2 o then  to c-phsse at 2370 C, The high temperature  c-phase,  which<br>
has potential applications are oxygen sensors, solid fuel cells and even several devices is difficult to retain at room temperature because the transformation is reversible. Efforts have been made  to stsbilise it by addition of a small amount of MgO,  CaO,<br>
Y0  Si N   or  AiN, The additive  controls  a  refined  micro-<br>
2 3     3 4 structure at a nanometer scale. The common methods of preparation<br>
include vapour phase reactions, co-precipitation process, hydro-thermal process, slkaxide or gel processes, mechanical attrition and combustion methods.<br>
None of these methods is- successful in producing a single phase c-ZrO compound- This high energy phase exists in extremely small crystallites of size belotu 30nm in support of their high surface energy. It requires a strict control of a homogeneous micro-structure at this scale and that; is not feasible so easily in these methods which involve s heterogeneous reaction at a relatively hicih temperature to ensure 3 complete decomposition of the pr&amp;tzur&amp;&amp;r and to ensure a complete el imination of byproduct impurities.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose 3 process for producing<br>
a transparent staba 1ised amorphous ceramic gel .<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing a transparent stabilised ceramic gel which uses commercially available raw materials.<br>
Sti11 another object of this invention is to propose a proces for producing a transparent stabilised ceramic gel which involves fewer steps than the processes of the known art -<br>
Yet another object of this invention is, to propose a process for producing a transparent stabilised ceramic gel which is a  highly<br>
pure c~ZrO  powder.<br>
2<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention wi11 be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention is provided a process for the preparation of a transparent amorphous ceramic gel comprising the steps of<br>
providing an aqueous solution of a zirconium salt, adding thereto an aqueous solution of an aluminium ©alt with stirring, followed by addition of ammonia solution with stirring to obtain 3 gel which is dried to obtain the amorphous ceramic Q&amp;l*<br>
In  this invention, a transparent amorphous ceramic gel is  deve-<br>
4+	.  3+<br>
loped by hydrolysing Zr   cations with 5- 10 moltt Al   additive in<br><br>
- 3- ~<br>
an aqueous solution, Al   additive supports gelation of hydro-4 +<br>
lyzed  Zr    in a polymeric network structure -  Thermal  decompo-<br>
o<br>
sition and annealing of gel at 350-850 C results in  recrystalli-<br>
3+ zation of a single phase finely divided loose nanopowder in  Al<br>
istabi lised  c-ZrO . It occurs via a refined mi c restructure in  an<br>
2 amorphous ceramic precursor of decomposed gel at as low  tempera-<br>
o ture  as 200 C by a self-control led process. The obtained  sample<br>
o is stable as such to a temperature as high as 850 C,<br>
A  transparent  gel  is  formed by a  simple  reaction  of  three<br>
reactants (i) ZrGCl -6H 0" <ii a1c1 and i> NH OH in  a<br>
2   2	3   2	4<br>
aqueous  solution  at  room  temperature.  Aqueous  solutions  of<br>
ZrDCl 6H 0   and  A1C1 .6M 0  are  obtained  by  dissolving   in<br>
2   2	3   2<br>
distilled  water in a molar concentration. The two solutions  are<br>
4+   4+ mixed  together  in a predetermined Zr  /Al   ratio  by  stirring<br>
with a magnetic starrer for 30 mins. at room temperature NH OH is  added  in steps through an aqueous solution to  induce  their<br>
hydrolysis  in a controlled manner while stirring  with  magnetic<br>
4+       4+-stirrer.  A hydrolysis reaction of Zr   and Al    cations  occurs<br>
with NH OH instantaneously and results in a white  co-precipitate<br>
4 in formation of their hydroxides.<br>
At intermediate stage of the reaction, the precipitates are not thermodynamically stable in an equilibrium configuration with solution. As a result, the precipitate dissolves in the solution after a certain period of the reaction. Viscosity of the solution goes on increasing as a function of time unti1 a clear transparent homogenized precursor mass appears. It takes 10-30 mins.  to<br><br>
	  4  -.<br>
get a clear transparent solution at an average value of its pH ~<br>
2.0 as per its concentration, A pH -2 value could foe  maintained<br>
at  a controlled and limited NH OH content just near  comple-tion<br>
4 of the hydrolysis reaction.<br>
The obtained viscous precursor mass is allowed to slowly evaporate the excess water at room temperature. When dried, it appears in a transparent sol id metalloceramic gel within a month or so depending on its composition- This is possible due to the AIO(OH) additive as will be apparent from the ensuing examples. 5-20 mol% additive of Al cations effectively supports gela-tion in a stagle amorphous polymeric structure as per its &gt;:~-ray diffraction. Several batches of the reactions are carried out by varying the A10 content in the final gel between 5 and 20 moIK, All of them result in a transparent solid gel or polymer.<br>
The gelation reaction occurs the best 25 C, or a preferably lower<br>
o<br>
temperature in the range of 5-10 C, with an average concentration of the precursor solution in the 0.2-0.5M range,<br>
o On heating at -200 C in air, a controlled thermal  decomposition<br>
of metalloceramic gel occurs in a refined amorphous ceramic powder of decomposed gel. Latter is dispersed and boiled in water and then filtered in order to remove away residual byproduct impurities, especially Cl anions, if any {tested by adding an AgNO  solution. The recovered powder recrystal1ised promptly into<br>
a further refined powder of Al   stabilised c-ZrO  at temperature<br>
2 o as  small  as 350 C. It has an average size  of  crystallites  as<br>
small  as  5-10nm  and that does not grow above  20nm  until  the<br>
o temperature is below 350 C.<br><br>
The  invention will now be explained in greater detail  with  the help of the following non-1imiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The  proposed hydrolysis reaction is carried out by adding  NH Oh<br>
4 (dissolved  in  water  in  0. 2M  solution)  to  0.5H  ZrOC 1 8H 0<br>
2   2 o solution  in water at 25 C, or a preferably lower temperature  in<br>
o the  range  of 5-10 C. NH OH is added in steps  by  stirring  the<br>
4 total  solution  with  a magnetic stirrer.  A  white  precipitate<br>
occurs  in a hydrolysed ZKMOH) . xH 0 product. It was  washed  in<br>
4   2<br>
o distilled  water,  filtered, dried and then heated  et  350 C  to<br>
decompose  into  a  desired c-ZrO  nanopowder.  It  is  not  very<br>
2<br>
o stable. It converts to m-ZrO  at 500 C<br>
2<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The  above  reaction is repeated by adding  0.5M  A1C1 ,6H 0  (in<br>
3   2<br>
o water)  to  the 0.5M ZrOCl 8H 0 solution in water at  25 C.  The<br>
volumes  in  the two solutions were taken such that  the  mixture<br>
contains  20  mol% of A1C1 .6H 0 and 80 mol%  of  ZrOCl 8H 0.  A<br>
3   2	2   2<br>
white  co-precipitate occurs in B hydrolysed product in  A10
ZrO (OH) . xH 0 on adding the NH OH. Stirring for 10-30 mins. helps<br>
4   2	4<br>
to get a clear transparent solution at pH   2.0. It dries into  a<br>
stable  transparent  gel  at room  temperature.  On  heating,  it<br>
3+	o<br>
converts into an Al   stabi1ised c-ZrO  nanopowder at 350-850 C-<br>
2 A pure single phase ceramic powder is obtained in this invention.<br>
Furthermore, as no any other chemical additive has been used during the reaction, it yields a highly pure powder in a single c-ZrOjt polymorphic phase. Evidently, it is a very convenient  and<br><br>
single method if compared with sol gel or other conventional methods in use to obtain similar ceramics. The final furnish c-ZrO  product is obtained in a few steps.<br><br>
