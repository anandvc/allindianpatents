				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a cervical vertebrae junction fixation device. Particularly, the present invention relates to the neurosurgical device for fixation of skull and spinal vertebrae, more particularly it relates to the neurosurgical device for repair of the cervical vertebrae junction, even more particularly the present invention relates to the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device for fixing the skull and the spine, and to the method of manufacturing the same and use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The Indian roads are prone to accidents. Majority of road accidents involve two wheelers. Most of the time the driver of the two wheelers is injured. Commonly, the injury is caused to the skeletal system, that is, fracture of bones. The fracture of a bone except the spinal vertebrae can be repaired easily. The<br>
fracture of spinal vertebrae calls for complicated surgery and subsequent trauma to the patient.<br>
The repair of spinal vertebrae is possible in two ways. The conventional way is to fuse the vertebra by bone grafting technique and the recent technique is to implant the neurosurgical device known as spinal vertebrae fixation device.<br>
The repair by the conventional technique takes extra long time, say five to seven months and causes tremendous trauma to the patient. The treatment by implantation of the neurosurgical device is convenient and this technique does not cause trauma to the patient to the extent as it is caused during the treatment by conventional technique.<br>
The implantation of the neurosurgical device, in case of fracture of the vertebrae, particularly the cervical vertebrae numbered 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 are/is fractured calls for specialist to perform the surgery. The neurosurgical device required for fixation of these vertebrae is different from the neurosurgical device required for fixation of the spinal vertebrae. In first case the skull is fixed with spinal vertebrae and in the second case the spinal vertebrae is fixed with another spinal vertebrae. Under special circumstances the neurosurgeon selects the neurosurgical device meant for fixation of skull and spinal vertebrae for fixing the spinal vertebrae with another spinal vertebrae. The best fixation is achieved only one the proper neurosurgical device is implanted.<br>
The neurosurgical devices as known in the prior art for fixation of skull and spinal vertebrae particularly the skull and cervical vertebrae, more particularly to repair the cervical vertebrae junction are complicated in design and hence complicated to construct. Such known devices comprise of the hips or the outwardly extended kinks and of particular angle between the loop and the legs. Such devices are not only difficult to construct but also difficult to implant. Their application is very limited. Therefore, such known devices have not become popular.<br>
The presently known devices for such purpose, as stated herein above are simply the solid rods, which have various other limitations. The main such limitation is that the device can not remain mobile and may not allow the growth of the vertebrae, particularly when implanted in the children, and can remain mobile, when implanted in the old aged people.<br>
NEED OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a neurosurgical device for fixation of skull and spinal vertebrae, particularly to have a neurosurgical device for fixation of skull and cervical vertebrae, more particularly to have a neurosurgical device to repair the cervical vertebrae junction, even more particularly to have the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device, still more particularly to have the cervical<br>
vertebrae junction fixation device for fixing the skull and spine, and to the method of manufacture and use thereof, which can overcome some of limitations/drawbacks of such neurosurgical devices known in the prior art.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to make a complete disclosure of a neurosurgical device for fixation of skull and spinal vertebrae, particularly of a cervical vertebrae junction fixation device for fixing the skull and spine, and of the method of manufacture and use thereof, which can overcome some of limitations/drawbacks of such neurosurgical devices known in the prior art as explained herein above.<br>
This is further an object of the present invention to propose for neurosurgical device for fixation of cervical vertebrae junction, and to propose the method of manufacture and use thereof, which is simple and easy to construct having simple configuration.<br>
This is still an object of the present invention to propose for a neurosurgical device, as stated herein above, which can not only remain mobile and may also allow the growth of the vertebrae, particularly when implanted in the children, and can remain mobile, when implanted in the old aged people.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE:<br>
Figure 1 shows the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device in accordance to another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows the side view of the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device in accordance to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows the side view of the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device in accordance to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows the side view of the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device in accordance to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance to the present invention the neurosurgical device, particularly the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device, as stated herein above comprises of two arms, preferably running parallel to each other. On one end,<br>
these arms form the closed loop and on the opposite end to the loop end these arms bend towards the inner side and essentially remain open to give advantages over similar known such devices.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a cervical vertebrae junction fixation device comprising two arms, wherein said arms form a closed loop on one end and bend towards the inner side on the opposite end. In one embodiment of this invention, the arms are provided with holes preferably at certain regular distance. In another embodiment of this invention, the arms are provided with undercuts preferably on one side of the arms. In yet another embodiment of this invention, the arms are provided with one hole.<br>
Now referring to Figure-1, the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device (1), as stated herein above comprises of two arms (2 and 3), preferably running parallel to each other. The arms (2 and 3) can be of any length. The length of the arms (2 and 3) is decided by the selected patient. On one end (4 and 5), these arms (2 and 3) form closed loop (6). The loop (6) forms an angle (7) with the arms (2 and 3). The scope of the presently disclosed neurosurgical device, particularly the cervical vertebrae junction fixation device is not limited by the length of the arms (2 and 3), size of the loop (6), angle (7) and distance between the two arms (2 and 3).<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the arms (2 and 3) on the opposite end (9 and 10), the ends opposite to the loop (6), bend towards the inner side and the extended parts (11 and 12) of the arms (2 and 3) form an angle (13).<br>
In accordance with one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the said arms (2 and 3) of said device (1) are provided with holes (14) preferably at certain regular distance, and optionally said loop (6) and/or said extended parts (11 and 12) of said arms (2 and 3) are provided with said holes (14) as shown in the Figure 3. Alternatively, the said arms (2 and 3) of said device (1) are provided with undercuts (15) preferably on one side of the said arms (2 and 3), and optionally said loop (6) and/or said extended parts (11 and 12) of said arms (2 and 3) are provided with said undercuts (15) as shown in Figure 4. Alternatively, the said arms (2 and 3) of said device (1) are provided with one hole (16), and optionally said loop (6) and/or said extended parts (11 and 12) of said arms (2 and 3) are provided with one hole (16) as shown in Figure 5.<br>
The present invention has been described with the help of accompanying figures, which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It is obvious that various modifications are possible to the present invention without deviating from the scope of the invention.
