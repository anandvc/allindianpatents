				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a barrier structure, and more particularly to<br>
a barrier plate for highways that has high flexibility, rigidity, weathering,<br>
anti-erosion, and lightweight so as to enhance protective function, and may provide<br>
warning and guiding effect by attaching reflective elements thereon.<br>
Description of the Prior Arts<br>
Conventional barrier for highways is generally made of metal in a<br>
punching manner and may cooperate with cement columns to form elongated<br>
continuous protection structures. Since the barrier for highways made of metal is<br>
hard and lacks flexibility, a great shock can not be effectively absorbed while a car<br>
crashes it, lowering protective effect. Moreover, in recycling process, the damaged<br>
barrier can not be reproduced due to its hardness. Although the warning structure of<br>
the conventional barrier includes reflective paints painted thereon, it will peel off<br>
easily after repeated use, decreasing warning and guiding function. Likewise,<br>
because the government is short of sufficient budget, the conventional Optronics<br>
facilities on highways, e.g., power supply, power line, can not be constructed<br>
completely, resulting in deficient illumination and communication equipments.<br>
What is worse if some emergency situations happen, maydays will be accordingly<br>
delayed. The prior art barrier for highways is always designed in a single color<br>
manner, having a dull appearance.<br>
The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the<br>
afore-described disadvantages.<br>
1<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a barrier plate for<br>
highways that may be recycled and decrease reconstruction cost.<br>
The secondary object of the present invention is to provide a barrier plate<br>
for highways that may enhance aesthetic appearance and beautify environment.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a barrier plate for<br>
highways that may prevent a car from downfall on the specific highways or<br>
mountain roads.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a barrier plate for<br>
highways that may save construction costs of Optronics facilities on the highways.<br>
Still a further object of the present invention is to provide a barrier plate<br>
for highways that may cause an illuminating and warning effect.<br>
Also, another object of the present invention is to provide a barrier plate<br>
for highways that may generate an illuminating and guiding function.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
barrier plate for highways comprising an M-shaped protective member, a saddle,<br>
and a support.<br>
The M-shaped protective member is made of plastic material and<br>
integrally press formed, having preferred flexibility, rigidity, weathering,<br>
anti-erosion, and lightweight, such that obtaining a recyclable purpose so as to save<br>
reconstruction cost. During the press forming process of the M-shaped protective<br>
member, a variety of colors and composite materials are added therein so as to<br>
achieve color changeable and environment beautifying effect. Furthermore, the<br>
2<br><br>
M-shaped protective member includes a plurality of trapezoid and spaced<br>
projections and concaved planes, each of the projections has holes corresponding to<br>
each other and arranged at the predetermined positions thereof, and has integrally<br>
formed and spaced first, second and third passages formed in the inner rim thereof,<br>
respectively. The first passage may be provided to receive a high tensile cord for<br>
enhancing resistance or to receive a tubular member in which the high tensile cord<br>
is inserted, improving protective and barrier function on the specific highways and<br>
mountain roads so as to prevent a car from downfall. The second and third passages<br>
are provided to receive an optical fiber of communication/network and a power line<br>
individually so as to acquire power supply of instant messaging and automatic<br>
warning, lowering construction costs of Optronics facilities on the highways. Also,<br>
each of the projections includes a warning structure affixed on the outer periphery<br>
thereof and having an adhesive warning tape attached thereon, wherein a reflective<br>
agent may be replaceably applied thereon or a reflective sheet may be replaceably<br>
inlaid thereon. The warning structure further has a LED light set and a LED<br>
illumination set attached onto the joining portion of the M-shaped protective<br>
member and the support. The LED light set and the LED illumination set may be<br>
utilized to be a reflective sign or a reflective marking line in different distance<br>
arrangement. Two ends of the M-shaped protective member may be constructed in<br>
the form of a semicircle, enhancing safety and aesthetic appearance.<br>
The saddle is made of ABS plastic material and injection molded in the<br>
shape of a fiat lamination, and one side thereof is joined with the M-shaped<br>
protective member by way of a trapezoid elongated retaining portion by which the<br>
* &gt;<br><br>
LED light set or the LED illumination set is affixed, and the saddle includes a<br>
plurality of corresponding bores provided on one side thereof and a recessed<br>
adhesive portion formed on another side thereof.<br>
The support, one end of which is inserted in the ground yet another end of<br>
which cooperates with the adhesive portion of the saddle, is retained by passing<br>
bolts through the M-shaped protective member. In addition, the support includes<br>
two semicircular clamping seats for eliminating its deformation or for easy<br>
replacement after damage.<br>
The M-shaped protective member, the saddle, and the support are<br>
assembled together in turn so as to complete an illuminative and warning barrier<br>
plate for use in highways. For use on specific highways or mountain roads, the<br>
tubular member is inserted into the M-shape protective member and includes a<br>
number of perforated openings and an intersected slot arranged therearound so as to<br>
align the holes with the intersected slot by means of a crossed retainer, finishing the<br>
assembly.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the support is vertically<br>
inserted in the ground and then is affixed by using the clamping seats. Thereafter,<br>
the M-shape protective member is assembled onto the support by virtue of the<br>
saddle and multiple screws, finishing a successive elongated barrier structure, head<br>
and distal ends of which are twisted in the shape of a semicircle, obtaining an<br>
anti-collision and shock-absorbing purpose. On the other hand, the adhesive<br>
warning tape of the warning structure may reflect light in dark conditions,<br>
achieving an illuminating and guiding purpose. At the joining portion of the<br>
4<br><br>
M-shaped protective member and the support are arranged the LED light set and<br>
the LED illumination set of the warning structure, generating an illuminating and<br>
warning effect.<br>
