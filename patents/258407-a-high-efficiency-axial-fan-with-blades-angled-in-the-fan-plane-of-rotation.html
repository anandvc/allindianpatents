Description A high efficiency axial fan<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an axial fan, with blades angled in the fan plane of rotation.<br>
The fan according to the present invention may be used in various applications, for example, to move air through a heat exchanger, or radiator, of a cooling system for the engine of a motor vehicle or the like.<br>
A specific sector for application of the fan according to the present invention is that of conditioning systems, that is to -say, heating and/or air conditioning for the interior of motor vehicles.<br>
Background Art<br>
Fans of this type must satisfy various requirements, including: low noise level, high efficiency, compactness, capacity to achieve good pressure and flow rate values.<br>
Patent EP-0 553 598, by the same Applicant, presents a fan with blades delimited at the leading edge and trailing edge by two curves which are two circular arcs when projected in the fan 'plane of rotation.<br>
Fans constructed in accordance with said patent] provide good efficiency and low noise, but have limits as regards the<br>
possibility of achieving high pressure values, since the blades<br><br>
are made with profiles whose centre line is relatively short compared with the blade radial extension.<br>
Moreover, fans construeted in accordance with! the above-. mentioned patent have a limited axial dimension, but a relatively large diameter.<br>
For the exchanger units of heating and/or air conditioning systems for the interior of motor vehicles the overall dimensions of the fan must be limited, which means that the diameter must<br><br>
WO 2006/016229	PCT/IB2005/002266<br>
2<br>
also be limited, whilst good air flow rates are required with high pressure and low noise.<br>
Fox these reasons, in the above-mentioned exchanger units centrifugal fans are often used, which may have a relatively small diameter, but with a rather large axial dimension.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
One aim of the present invention is to provide a fan which has generally limited dimensions, which can develop good air flow ¦ rates with high pressure and low noise values.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, an axial fan as specified in claim 1 is presented.<br>
The dependent claims refer to preferred and advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention is described in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate a preferred, non-limiting embodiment, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a front view of the fan in accordance with the present, invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a side projection view of the fan illustrated in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of the fan illustrated in the previous figures;<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic front view of a blade of the fan illustrated in the previous figures,-<br>
Figure 4a is a schematic side view of a blade of the fan illustrated in the previous figures;<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-section of a profile and the respective geometric characteristics; and<br>
Figure 6 is a cross-section of several profiles at various fan diameters.<br>
Detailed description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, the fan 1 rotates<br>
about an axis 2 in a plane XY and comprises a central hub 3, with<br><br>
WO 2006/016229	PCT/IB 2005/00 2266<br>
3<br>
a centre O, to which a plurality of blades 4 are connected, the blades being curved in the fan 1 plane of rotation XY-<br>
The blades 4 have a root 5, a tip 6 and are delimited by a concave leading edge 7 and a convex trailing edge 8.<br>
For the best results in terms of efficiency, flow rate and air pressure, the fan 1 rotates with a direction of| rotation V, illustrated in Figures 1 and 4, so that the tip 6 of| each blade 4 encounters the air flow before the root 5.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example Of the geometric characteristics of a blade 4: the leading edge 7 is delimited by two circular arc segments 9, 10, and the trailing edge 8 is delimited by one circular arc segment 11.<br>
In the leading edge 1, a radius labelled Rl is the point of change from one circular arc segment to the other circular arc segment. <br>
According to the example in Figure 4, the general dimensions of the projection of a blade 4 in the plane XY are isummarised in table 1: Table 1 - dimensions of a. blade 4.<br><br>
		Radius of internal segment (mm)		Radius change	of (jnm)	Radius of external segment (mm)<br>
Leading (Ref. 7)	edge	59.37 (Ref.	9)		48.79{Ref.	Rl)	27.52 (Ref. 10)<br>
			Radius	(mm)		<br>
Trailing (Ref. 8)	edge	31.73	(Ref. 11)			<br>
The general geometric characteristics of the blade 4 are defined relative to a hub with 55 mm diameter, that is to say, the blade 4 has a minimum radius Rmin=27.5 mm at the root 5, and a fan 1 external diameter of 155 mm, therefore that the blade 4 has a maximum radius Rmax=77.5 mm at the tip 6; meaning that the blade 4 has a 50 mm radial extension.<br>
Considering that the blade 4 has a minimum radius Rmin=27.5 mm and a maximum radius Rmax=77.5 mm, the leading edge 7. has a radius Rl, where the change in the circular arc occurs, corresponding to<br><br>
WO 2006/016229,	PCT/IB2005/002266<br>
4<br>
42.6% of the radial extension of the leading edge 7 (starting at the root 5), an extension which, as already indicated, is 50 mm.<br>
The part 9 of the leading edge 7 closest to the root 5 consists of a circular arc with a radius equal to around 76.6% of the radius Rmax, and the part 10 of the leading edge 7 closest to the tip 6 consists of a circular arc segment with a radius equal to around 35.5% of the radius Rmax of the blade 4.<br>
As regards the trailing edge 8, the circular arc segment 11 has a radius equal to around 40.9% of the radius Rmax of the blade 4. -<br>
The dimensions in percentages are summarised in table 2: Table 2 - blade 4 dimensions in nercentaoe form.<br><br>
	Internal	Change radius	External<br>
	segment radius	(% of blade	segment<br>
	(5s of Rmax)	extension =	radius<br>
		Emax-Rmin)	(% of Rmax)<br>

	Radius (%	of Rmax)	<br>
Trailing edge	40.9 (Ref. 11)		<br>
(kef. 8)			<br>
Satisfactory results in terms of flow rate, pressure and noise were achieved even with values around these percentage dimensions.<br>
In particular, variations of 10% more or less on the above-mentioned dimensions are possible.<br>
The percentage ranges relative to the dimensions are summarised in table 3: Table 3 - Blade 4 edges percentage ranges.<br><br>
		Internal segment radius (% of Rmax)	Change radius (% of blade extension = % of Rmax-Rmin)	External segment radius (% of Rmax)	<br>
	beading edge (Ref. 7)	68.9 - 84.3 (Ref. 9)	38.3 - 46.9(Ref. Rl)	32 - 39(Ref. 10)	<br>
	Radius (% Rmax)	<br>
	Trailing edge (kef. 8)	36.8 - 45 (Ref.	11)		<br><br><br>
WO 2006/016229	PCT/IB2005/002266<br>
5<br>
For the leading edge 7, in the circular arc segment change zone, there may be a suitable fillet so that the edge 7 is continuous and free of cusps.<br>
As regards the width or angular extension of the blades, again with reference to Figure 4, the projection of the blade 4 in the plane XY has an amplitude, at the root 5, represented by an angle Bl relative to the centre O of the fan 1 of around 41 degrees and an amplitude, at the tip 6, represented by an angle B'2 relative to the centre O of around 37 degrees.<br>
Again, satisfactory results were achieved in terms of flow<br>
rate, pressure and noise with values of angles Bl, B2, around these<br>
values. In particular, variations of 10% more or less than the<br>
angles indicated are possible. The angle Bl may vary, from 36.9 to<br>
45.1 degrees, whilst the angle B2 may vary from 33.3 to 40.7<br>
degrees.	<br>
In general, it must also be considered that, due to the plastic material used to make fans, variations in all of the dimensions and angles of 5% more or less must all be considered within the values indicated.<br>
Considering, for example, the respective bisectang lines of the angles Bl, B2 and following the fan 1 direction of rotation V, the tip 6 is further forward than the root 5 by an angle B3 of around 15.6 degrees.<br>
Other angles characteristic of the blade 4 are angles B4, B5, B6, B7 (Figure 4) formed by the respective tangents to the two edges 7, 8 and by the respective lines passing through points S, T, N, M: the angles B4 and'B5 are respectively 26 and 59 degrees and the angles B6, B7 are respectively 22 and 57 degrees. ¦ There may be between four and nine blades 4 and, according to a preferred embodiment, there are seven blades 4 and they are separated by angles that are not equal.<br>
The angles to the centre 0, between one blade and another -considering for example the corresponding leading: edges 7 or trailing edges 8 - are: 51; 106; 157; 204; 259; 3ll (degrees) .<br>
These angles provide advantages in terms of noise, whilst the fan 1 remains completely statically and dynamically balanced.<br><br>
WO 2006/016229	PCT/IB2005/002266<br>

Each bliade 4 consists of a set of aerodynamic profiles which gradually join up starting from the root 5 towards the tip 6.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates five profiles 12 - 16, relative to respective sections at various intervals along the radial extension of a blade 4.<br>
The profiles 12 - 16 are also formed by the geometric characteristics of which an example is provided in Figure 5 for one of the' profiles, specifically illustrating profile 12.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 5, each profile 12 - 16 is formed by a continuous centre line LI without points of inflection or cusps and by a chord :L2 .<br>
Each profile 12 - 16 is also formed by angles BLE, BTE of incidence with the leading edge and with the trailing edge, said angles formed by the respective tangents to the centre line LI at the point of intersection "with the" leading edge and with the -trailing edge and a respective straight line perpendicular to the plane xif passing through the corresponding points of intersection.<br>
With reference to the five profiles 12 - 16, table 4 below indicates the angles of the leading edge BLE and of the trailing ¦ edge BTE, the length of the centre line LI and the chord L2 of the profiles of a blade 4.<br>
Table 4l - Radial position, angles of leading and trailing edges, length of centre line and chord of the profiles of a blade 4.<br><br>
Profile	Radialposition '(%&gt;	Radius (irnn)	BLE (degrees)	BTE (degrees}	1.1 (centre line mm)	LI % (% centre line relative to Rmax)	L2 (chord mm)<br>

13	26.25	40.6	72	30	37.0907	47.86%	35.99<br>

16	100	77.5	79	55	53.4942	69.02%	53.02<br>
It should be noticed that the centre line LI has values which are important percentages of the fan 1 radius and which increase from a minimum value at the hub to a maximum value at the tip of the blaide.<br><br>
WO 2006/016229	POT/IB 2005/002266<br>
7<br>
Again, good results can be achieved with' values around these percentage dimensions. In particular, variations of 10% more or less on the above-mentioned dimensions are possible.<br>
The percentage ranges relative to the length of the centre line are summarised in table 4a below:<br>
Table 4a - Radial position - % range of length of centre line of<br>
profiles of a blade 4.	;<br>
Profile (Reference)	% radial position	Radius radial position (iron)	LI % range (% centre line relative to Rmax)<br>

14	50.87	52.9	48.8%	59.6%<br>
15	75.46	65.2	55.5%	67.8%<br>
-16	100	77.5	62.1%	75. 9%<br>
It should be noticed that the thickness of each; profile 12 -16, according to a typical trend of wing-shaped profiles, initially increases, reaching a maximum value S-MAX 'at around 20% of the length of the ceatre line LI, then it graduallly decreases as far as the trailing edge 8.<br>
In percentages, the thickness S-MAX is between 2.,81% and 2.88% of the radius Rmax; the thickness of the profiles is distributed symmetrically relative to the centre line LI. '<br>
The positions of the profiles 12-16 relative to the radial extension of a blade 4 and the relative values for the thickness trend according to their position with respect to the centre line LI are summarised in table 5.<br><br>

Table 6 below summarises the actual mm values of the trend of thicknesses according to their position with respect to the centre line LI for each profile 12 - 16 with reference to the embodiment illustrated. Table 6 - Thickness trend in mm of blade 4 profiles 12 - 16.<br>

The1 profiles 12 - 16 are preferably delimited with an elliptical fillet, on the leading edge 7 side, and with a truncation created using a segment of a straight line on the trailing edge 8 side.<br>
Figure 4a is a schematic illustration of a meridian section, that is to say, a lateral section extending in the direction of a radius, of the fan 1 at a blade 4 making the trends of the edges 7 and 8 evident.<br>
Table 7 below shows the position mm values relative to an axis 2 perpendicular to the plane XY and taking the lower edge of the hub 3 as a reference.<br>
Table 7 - Trend of blade 4 profiles 12 - 16 relative to a meridian section.<br>

15	21.8639	2.75294<br>
16	20.6228	2-20486<br>
This table indicates that each blade 4 has a maximum axial dimension at the hub 3, and that it is 21.95 mm, that is to say, in terms of percentages, the blade 4 has a maximum axial dimension which iis 28.32% of the radius Rmax.<br><br>
WO 2006/016229	PCT/IB2005/002266<br>
9<br>
Therefore, it may be seen that the blade 4 extends quite considerably in an axial direction and that said axial dimension is almost a third of the maximum radius Rmax of the fan 1.<br>
The table below summarises the axial extension values in the<br>
i<br>
various profiles 12 - 16 expressed in mm, as a percentage value relative to the fan 1 maximum radius, and with a percentage range of 10% more or less. The axial extension values in said ranges also provided satisfactory results.<br>

The fan according to the present invention achieves optimum<br>
t performance in terms of efficiency, flow rate and | air pressure<br>
with very compact overall dimensions.<br>
Thanks to the special design of the blades, with1 particularly aerodynamically efficient profiles, the noise level is also very low.<br>
The axial fan disclosed is capable of performance comparable with that of centrifugal fans with significantly smaller dimensions.<br>
These features are especially advantageous in air conditioning systems and the like for motor vehicles, in which reducing the dimensions is very important.<br>
The invention described may be subject to modifications and variations without thereby departing from the scope of the inventive concept described in the claims herein.<br><br>
