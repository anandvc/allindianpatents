				<td>This invention relates to a composition useful for safe blasting of coal in underground mines and other excavation works and a process for preparing the said composition.<br>
The nitroglycerine (NG) based explosives are available in cartridge form in diameter 32 mm and weight 200 gm. These explosives have velocity of detonation (VOD) ranging from 2000 to 2500 m/sec. and strength from 35 to 40 percent blasting gelatin explosive. The density varies from 1.00 to 1.20 gm/cm3. Its cartridge material is waxed paper. These are highly sensitive to shock, friction, heat and flame. The fume quality is poor. When misfired, explosives are mixed in blasted muck may cause accident during loading and thereby increased danger during the operation.<br>
The shiny explosives contained oxidizing agents in the range of 50 - 70 wt%, reducing agents in the range of 10 - 20 wt%, cooling agents in the range of 5 - 20 wt % and rest in the range of 0.1 - 1 wt % . Slurry explosives are available in cartridge form having a diameter from 32 mm , weight 200 gm. and cartridge material is plastic tube with copper clips or blow molded tube. They are cap sensitive composition. Their velocity of detonation varies from 2900 to 3300 m/sec. and density 1.10 to 1.15 gm/cm3.<br>
Emulsion explosives have high velocity of detonation ranging from 3500 to 4000 m/sec. They are available in 32 mm diameter and suitable for only zero degree gassy coal mines.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a composition useful for excavation works for safe blasting of coal in underground mines which obviates the above noted drawbacks.<br>
Another object is to provide an explosive composition for blasting of coal from underground gassy and dusty coal mines.<br>
Yet another object is to develop an explosive composition which would be permitted for solid blasting of coal (P5) underground mines. The P5 group ( P3 explosive formulation are used in solid blasting of coal) of explosive for blasting of coal in 32 mm<br><br>
Diameter and cap - sensitive, low velocity of detonation (less than 3300 m/sec.) and non-incendive in methane and coal dust explosive mixture.<br>
The composition of the present invention utilizes ingredients of oxidizing, reducing, crossi-linking, gassing agents and stabilizer to produce zero oxygen balance to provide a composition suitable as a slurry explosive.<br>

It is a feature of the present invention that the composition is not a mere admixture<br>
but a synergistic mixture having properties which are different to the mere aggregation of<br>
the properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing the composition of the present invention, which comprizes dissolving oxidizing agents in water at 65 -70 °C and maintaining pH of the solution in the range 4.5 to 5.0 by adding acetic acid / nitric acid, adding to the solution so obtained fuel such as thiourea, urea, sugar and guar gum and mono ethylene glycol and cooling agent such as chloride.<br>
