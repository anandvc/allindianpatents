				<td>The invention relates to a film casting machine and a process for producing a polyimide film.<br>
One of the objective of the invention is to provide a film casting machine which can produce polyimide films of various thickness from polyamic acid solution. Another objective of the invention is to provide a process for producing thin polyimide film which is free of pin-holes and blisters.<br>
U.S. Patent numbers 3,179.814; 3,179,834 and 1,098,556 disoloses laboratory preparation of polyimide film from polyamio acid solution.<br>
The film casting machine according to the invention provides a machine for producing polyimide film of excellent quality on a comercial scale. The method of producing a polyimide film according to the invention uses the film casting machine according to the invention and obtain polyimide film having excellent thermal and electrical insulation whloh can be used for applications which has exacting requirements. Polyimide films of various thickness in the order of tens of microns to hundreds of microns can be produced with the film casting machine according to the invention. The length and breadth of the polyimide film will depend on the size of the roller used in the film casting machine.<br><br>
Thus the invention provides a film casting machine comprising a roller having a smooth surface rotatably mounted in a housing with a liftable top cover, the said roller being provided with a variable speed drive, a heater located inside the said housing below the roller, an inlet in the housing for providing an inert gas into the housing, a blade assembly located close to the periphery of the roller for casting film by doctor blading, a feeder plate located close to the blade assembly for feeding the material to be cast and at least one temperature sensor for sensing the temperature inside the housing.<br>
The invention also provides a method of producing a polyinide film by casting with the film casting machine described hereinabove, comprising the steps of preparing a polyamic aoid solution having a solid content of 10 to 12.5 percent by weight and a viscosity of 20,000 to 80,000 cps, feeding the said polyamic acid solution to the surface of the rotating roller of the film casting machine through the feeder plate of the film casting machine to obtain a uniform coating on the roller having a desired thickness with the blade assembly, closing the top cover of the housing and purging the space between the roller and housing with an inert gas, heating the film slowly increasing the temperature to a temperature not exceeding 450°C in the inert atmosphere for a period sufficient to convert the polyamic acid film into polyimide film and removing the polyimide film from the roller in a known manner after roller with the film is cooled to a temperature near the room temperature.<br><br>
The invention is described with reference to the accompanying drawing showing a prefered embodiment of the film casting machine.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the front view of the film casting machine; and<br>
Fig. 2 shows the end view of the film casting machine.<br>
The film casting machine according to the invention comprises a freely rotatable roller (1) mounted inside a housing (8) with a liftable top cover (12). The rotatable roller 
 <br>
sensors tor accurate monitoring of temperature. A blade assembly (10) is provided close to the periphery of the roller (1), for casting the film by doctor blading. A feeder plate (11) is located close to the blade assembly (10) for feeding the material to be cast into a film. Preferably a perforated plate (8) is provided between the heater (7) and the roller (1). The housing is preferably insulated with materials such as ceramic wool and covered with aluminium lining. The heating rate is controlled using a proportional controller. The roller (1) is preferably made of stainless steel with a polished surface. The position of the blade in the blade assembly (10) is adjustable for adjusting the gap between the edge of the blade and the surface of the roller. This will enable casting of film with different thickness. The liftable top cover (12) is an air tight cover to maintain the inert atmosphere in the housing (8) during the casting of film.<br>
The film casting machine is used for casting good quality polyimlde film from polyamic acid by the process described below.<br>
Polyamio acid solution having a solid content of 10 to 12.5X by weight and Brookfield viscosity of 20,000 to 80,000 cps is filtered and degassed under vacuum. The roller (1) is cleaned thoroughly before casting the polyamic acid solution film. The blade  assembly  (12) is mounte3in front of the roller (1) and  a<br><br>
desired gap is provided between the roller (1) and the blade using feeler gauge. Roller is then driven at low speed preferably about 3 to 4 RPM. Roller speed is adjusted in accordance with the viscosity of the polyanio acid solution and the thickness of the polyamic acid solution film used for casting. Filtered and degassed polyamic acid solution is then charged and spread uniformly on the roller with the help of a feeder plate (11) placed very close to the doctors blade as shown in Fig.2. Feeder plate (11) helps in uniformly spreading the resin across the full length of the roller and finally doctors blade controls precisely the thickness of the film cast on the roller. Excess resin is thrown out by the doctors blade and is collected separately. After the uniform layer of polyamic acid solution of desired thickness is cast on the roller, the feeder plate and the doctors blade are removed slowly and carefully so as not to create any disturbance on the cast film. The housing (8) is then covered with the top cover (12). An inert gas such as nitrogen is purged inside the chamber to maintain a nitrogen blanket around the roller. The roller is then heated using a pre-determined time-temperature cycle. Typical time temperature cycles are shown in table I. Initially the heating rate is kept low to enable the solvent to evaporate slowly and uniformly from the bulk of the cast film. After the bulk of the solvent is evaporated and the film becomes tack-free, heating rate is increased to a temperature at which the polyamic acid gets converted into polyimide film.  The temperature is maintained for<br><br>
sufficiently long for completing the conversion. Prefered temperature at which the temperature is maintained is about 300*^C and for a prefered time of about 1 hour.<br>
Polyimide film thus formed is cooled and removed from the roller and trimmed and characterised for its physical, mechanical, electrical and thermal properties.<br>
The following examples show the prefered process steps for casting polyimide films from polyamio acid solution.<br>
Example 1<br>
2.5 kg of polyamic acid solution having solid content of 11.5X, by weight, inherent viscosity 2.1 dl/g and solution viscosity of 40,000 ops is filtered and degassed under vacuum until the resin solution is completely free from dissolved gases. Doctor"s blade is mounted on the fixtures in front of the roller and the gap between the roller and the blade is adjusted to 0.7 mm with the help of a feeler gauge. The roller is then driven at 3.5 RPM. Filtered and degassed polyamic acid solution is charged on to the roller and spread uniformly with the help of the feeder plate held  close to the doctor"s blade.  Doctor"s blade finally  helps<br><br>
in laying 0.7 mm thick uniform polyamic acid solution film on the roller and excess resin is thrown out, which is collected separately. After casting the uniform layer of polyamic acid solution film on the roller. the feeder plate is withdrawn and then the doctor"s blade is removed from the fixtures very slowly and carefully so as not to create any disturbance on the cast film. The roller is then covered with the top lid and the temperature inside the housing is raised as per the time-temperature cycle given in table I. Initially the heating rate is kept low at the rate of 10C per hour to allow slow evaporation of the solvent from the bulk of the polyamic acid solution film. The heating rate is maintained till the temperature reaches es*-* and it is held at this temperature for 2 hours. Then the temperature inside the housing is further increased to 100*^0 maintaining the same heating rate. Thereafter, the heating rate is increased to 20*^C per hour till a temperature of t50*-"C is attained. After that the heating rate is further Increased to 40*^0 per hour till the final temperature of 300*^0 is attained. The temperature inside the housing is maintained at this temperature for one hour and then cooled. The film is removed from the roller, trimmed and characterised for its thickness uniformity, mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. Table II gives the properties of the films thus produced.<br><br><br><br><br>
Siwilar film casting fexperimerits were carried out as in Exanple 1, for casting thinner polytmide films. 1.3 kg of polyamic acid solution is filtered and degassed under vacuum and charged on to the roller. Gap between the roller and the doctor"s blade is set at 0.35 mm. The roller is driven at 4 RPM. After casting uniformly a 0.35 mm thick polyamic acid solution film on the roller. the film is cured in the same manner as described in example 1. The film is then removed from the roller, trimmed and characterised for its properties. Table III gives the properties of the films so produced.<br><br><br>
