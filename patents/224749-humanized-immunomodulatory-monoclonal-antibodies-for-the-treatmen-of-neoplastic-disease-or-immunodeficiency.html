				<td>HUMANIZED IMMUNOMODULATORY MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR THE<br>
TREATMENT OF NEOPLASTIC DISEASE OR IMMUNODEFICIENCY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of imrmmotherapy and more specifically<br>
concerns humanized monoclonal antibodies useful for therapy of a variety of indications,<br>
particularly in the treatment of cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cancer in its different forms is a major cause of death in humans. The most widely used<br>
therapeutic treatments of cancer are surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The rapid increase of<br>
knowledge in recent years about the molecular and cellular bases of immune regulation,<br>
particularly at the level of T-cell responses, provides a new arsenal of immunotherapeutic<br>
approaches including the development of tumor vaccines. Certain monoclonal antibodies<br>
(mAbs) were shown to have immunomodulatory activity including the ability to bind<br>
determinants on the surface of T cells and to induce proliferation, activation or differentiation of<br>
these cells.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies derived from mouse hybridomas contain substantial stretches of<br>
amino acid sequences that are immunogenic when injected into a human patient, often<br>
eliminating the antibody's therapeutic efficacy after an initial treatment. While the production<br>
of so called "chimeric antibodies" (i.e., mouse variable regions joined to human constant<br>
regions) has proven somewhat successful, a significant immunogenicity impediment remains.<br>
Recombinant DNA technology has been utilized to produce immunoglobulins containing<br>
human framework regions (FRs) combined with complementarity determining regions (CDRs)<br>
from a donor mouse or rat immunoglobulin. These new proteins are called "reshaped" or<br>
"humanized" immunoglobulins and the process by which the donor immunoglobulin is<br>
converted into a human-like immunoglobulin by combining its CDRs with a human framework<br>
is called "humanization". Humanized antibodies are important because they bind to the same<br>
antigen as the original antibodies, but are less immunogenic when injected into humans.<br>
US Patent No. 6,294,654 discloses a modified immunoglobulin molecule or functional<br>
fragment or part thereof (Ig), having an antigenic peptide foreign to the Ig incorporated in one or<br>
more non-CDR loops, and wherein the main outline of the constant domain framework is<br>
maintained. Further disclosed is the use of the modified antibody for therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic use.<br>
US Patent No. 6,074,635 discloses a method for antigen independent activation of T cells in<br>
vitro comprising contacting T cells in the absence of antigen with a combination of at least two<br>
cytokines selected from the group consisting of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis<br>
factor alpha, or functionally equivalent fragments thereof.<br>
US Patent No. 5,658,741 discloses a method of inducing the activation and proliferation of T-<br>
cells, said method comprising: (a) conjugating a plurality of T-cell specific monoclonal antibodies to<br>
an aminodextran molecule having 7-20% by weight amine groups and a molecular weight of at least<br>
100,000 daltons, wherein the molar ratio of said antibodies to said aminodextran is greater than or<br>
equal to two; and (b) reacting said conjugate with a sample containing said T-cells to effect the<br>
binding of said conjugated antibodies to said T-cells to induce activation and proliferation of said T-cells.<br>
US Patent 5,585,089 of Queen et al. discloses a humanized immunoglobulin having<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from a donor immunoglobulin and heavy and light<br>
chain variable region frameworks from human acceptor immunoglobulin heavy and light chains,<br>
which humanized immunoglobulin specifically binds to an antigen with an affinity constant of at<br>
least 107 M"1 and no greater than about four-fold that of the donor immunoglobulin, wherein said<br>
humanized immunoglobulin comprises amino acids from the donor immunoglobulin framework<br>
outside the Kabat and Chothia CDRs, wherein the donor amino acids replace corresponding amino<br>
acids in the acceptor immunoglobulin heavy or light chain frameworks, and each of said donor amino<br>
acids: (I) is adjacent to a CDR in the donor immunoglobulin sequence, or (II) contains an atom<br>
within a distance of 4A of a CDR in said humanized immunoglobulin.<br>
WO 91/09967 of Adair et al. discloses CDR-grafted antibody heavy and light chains that<br>
comprise acceptor framework and donor antigen binding regions, the heavy chains comprising donor<br>
residues in at least one of positions (6, 23) and/or (24, 48) and/or (49, 71) and/or (73, 75) and/or (76)<br>
and/or (78) and (88) and/or (91). The CDR-grafted light chains comprise donor residues at the at<br>
least one of positions (1) and/or (3) and (46) and/or (47) or at the at least one of positions (46, 48, 58)<br>
and (71). The CDR-grafted antibodies are preferably humanised antibodies, having non human, e.g.<br>
rodent, donor and human acceptor frameworks.<br>
US Patent 5,225,539, of Winter, discloses an altered antibody or antigen-binding fragment<br>
thereof, wherein a variable domain of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment has the framework<br>
regions of a first immunoglobulin heavy or light chain variable domain and the complementarity<br>
determining regions of a second immunoglobulin heavy or light chain variable domain, wherein said<br>
second immunoglobulin heavy or light chain variable domain is different from said first<br>
immunoglobulin heavy or light chain variable domain in antigen binding specificity, antigen binding<br>
affinity, species, class or subclass.<br>
US 5,225,539, WO 91/09967 and US Patent 5,585,089 do not provide sufficient tools and<br>
comprehensive description for carrying out the synthesis of an altered antibody, particularly a<br>
humanized antibody, by a person skilled in the art.<br>
US 5,618,920 relates to the secretion of heavy chain immunoglobulin fragments and light chain<br>
immunoglobulins from prokaryotic hosts using a prokaryotic secretion signal peptide. US 5,618,920<br>
does not disclose nor claim production of immunoglobulins in human hybridoma cell lines.<br>
US Patent No. 5,897,862 of one of the inventors of the present invention which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference, discloses a monoclonal antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof, wherein<br>
the monoclonal antibody: (i) is secreted by the hybridoma cell line deposited at the Collection<br>
Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes (CNCM), under Accession No. 1-1397, or (ii) recognizes<br>
the same antigenic epitope as the antibody under (i). The monoclonal antibody disclosed in<br>
US5,897,862 is directed against "Daudi" cells, a human B lymphoblastoid cell line, and was shown<br>
to stimulate murine lymphocytes and human peripheral blood T cells (Hardy et al, Cell Immunol.<br>
118:22. 1989). This murine antibody is also termed mBAT-1 hereinafter. mBAT-1 also exhibits<br>
anti-tumor and immunostimulatory effects in various types of tumors (Hardy et al., Int. J. Oncol.<br>
12:897, 2001) including tumors of human origin (Hardy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:5756, 1997).<br>
International Patent Application WO 00/58363 of one of the inventors of the present invention<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a monoclonal antibody having a variable region<br>
comprising the heavy chain variable region and/or the Kappa light chain variable region of mBAT-1<br>
or a heavy chain variable region and/or a Kappa light chain variable region having at least 70%<br>
identity to the heavy chain variable region and/or the Kappa light chain variable region of mBAT-1.<br>
Nowhere in the background art is it taught or suggested that a humanized monoclonal antibody<br>
comprising CDRs of a murine origin and FRs of a human origin may elicit an immune response and<br>
may further exhibit anti-cancer activity. Moreover, there is an unmet need for reliable methods for<br>
designing functional humanized antibodies, as it is well known in the art that the synthesis of the<br>
humanized antibody of the present invention cannot be predictably or routinely based on the<br>
background art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a humanized monoclonal<br>
immunomodulatory antibody, also termed hereinafter hBAT-1, which binds to B<br>
lymphoblastoid cells and induces proliferation and activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes.<br>
Said hBAT-1 is based on the previously known murine monoclonal immunomodulatory<br>
antibody, also termed herein mBAT-1, which binds to B lymphoblastoid cells and induces<br>
proliferation and activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and further elicits an anti-tumor<br>
effect when injected into a tumor.-bearing subject.<br>
The present invention provides a comprehensive description of the humanization process<br>
of mBAT-1 along with the rationale for each synthesis step. Thus, the description of the<br>
humanization process provided in the present invention is suitable for humanization of BAT<br>
antibodies other than mBAT-1, by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The administration of humanized BAT-1 antibody offers a method for therapeutic<br>
prevention, detection or treatment of cancer. Treatment of a subject in need thereof with the<br>
humanized form of the BAT-1 antibody, as provided by the present invention, is considerably<br>
more efficient than treatment with a chimeric BAT-1 antibody, and avoids adverse<br>
irnrnunogenic responses.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
I. Definitions<br>
For convenience certain terms employed in the specifications, examples and claims are<br>
set forth.<br>
The term "antibody" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal<br>
antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies) and antibody fragments so long as they<br>
exhibit the desired biological activity. "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of a full length<br>
antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody<br>
fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain<br>
antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to antibodies that are highly<br>
specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The monoclonal antibodies to be used in<br>
accordance with the present invention may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent 4,816,567 of Cabilly et al.).<br>
The term "framework region" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other<br>
than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. The term "hypervariable region" when<br>
used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen<br>
binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a "complementarity<br>
determining region" or "CDR". The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of<br>
an antigen. The extent of FRs and CDRs has been precisely defined (see, Kabat et al., ibid).<br>
As used herein, the term "humanized antibody" refers to an antibody comprising a<br>
framework region from a human antibody and one or more CDRs from a non-human (usually a<br>
mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. Parts of a humanized immunoglobulin, except possibly the<br>
CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of natural human immunoglobulrn<br>
sequences. Importantly, the humanized antibody is expected to bind to the same antigen as the<br>
donor antibody that provides the CDRs. For further details, see e.g. US. Pat. No. 5,225,539<br>
assigned to Medical Research Council, UK.<br>
The expression "human antibody" is intended to mean an antibody encoded by a gene<br>
actually occurring in a human, or an allele, variant or mutant thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "donor" or "parental" immunoglobulin refers to the non-human<br>
immunoglobulin providing the CDRs.<br>
As used herein, the term "acceptor" immunoglobulin refers to the human immunoglobulin<br>
providing the framework.<br>
The term "expression vector" as used herein refers to a recombinant DNA molecule<br>
containing a desired coding sequence and appropriate nucleic acid sequences necessary for the<br>
expression of the operably linked coding sequence in a particular host cell. It is contemplated<br>
that the present invention encompasses expression vectors that are integrated into host cell<br>
genomes, as well as vectors that remain unintegrated into the host genome.<br>
The term "genetically modified cells" as referred to herein relates to cells being<br>
transfected or infected by a vector, as exemplified by a virus encoding a polyp eptide of interest,<br>
said cells capable of expressing said polypeptide. Particularly in the context of this invention,<br>
the genetically modified cells are capable of expressing and secreting the antibody of the<br>
invention.<br>
The term "transfection" refers to the introduction of DNA into a host cell. It is<br>
contemplated that coding sequences may be expressed in transfected cells. Numerous methods<br>
of transfection are known to the ordinary skilled artisan, for example, CaPCv and<br>
electroporation.<br>
The term "anti-tumor effect" as used herein, refers to a biological effect which can be<br>
manifested by a decrease in tumor volume, a decrease in the number of tumor cells, a decrease<br>
in the number of metastases, an increase in life expectancy, or amelioration of various<br>
physiological symptoms associated with the cancerous condition. An "anti-tumor effect" can<br>
also be manifested by the ability of the antibody of the invention in prevention of the occurrence<br>
of tumor in the first place. Given its properties, the antibody of the invention can be used both in<br>
the treatment of acute cancer as well as in cancer prophylaxis.<br>
Herein the term "excipient" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition to further facilitate administration of a compound. Examples, without limitation, of<br>
excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch,<br>
cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols. Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may also include one or more additional active ingredients.<br>
The term "Polymerase Chain Reaction" ("PCR") refers to the methods disclosed in U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202, and 4,965,188.<br>
II. Preferred modes for carrying out the invention<br>
a. Antibody preparation<br>
In order to humanize the BAT-1 antibody, the non-human antibody starting material, namely<br>
mBAT-1 is prepared, following the design and preparation of the humanized variants. Some<br>
aspects of this invention, including the selection of a donor non-human antibody variable<br>
domain, humanizing an antibody gene sequence and producing a desired humanized antibody,<br>
are described in the following sections.<br>
(i) Preparation of the non-humanized antibody<br>
The murine BAT-1 monoclonal antibody was described previously in US Patent<br>
5,897,862. Accordingly, a representative hybridoma cell line that produces monoclonal murine<br>
BAT-1 antibodies, was deposited at the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes<br>
(CNCM), Institute Pasteur, 25, Rue du Docteur Roux, 75724, Paris, Cedex 15, under Deposit<br>
Accession No. 1-1397, on Jan. 28, 1994.<br>
Alternatively, the chimeric ?1/ic BAT-1 antibody as produced from the murine BAT-1 may<br>
be used for the preparation of a humanized BAT-1. The chimeric BAT-1 antibody and its<br>
production, have been described in PCT application No. WO 00/58363.<br>
(ii) Design strategy of the humanized antibody<br>
The present invention discloses procedures for hurnanization of BAT-1 antibody via a<br>
process in which the donor antibody, preferably mouse antibody, is converted into a human-like<br>
antibody by combining the CDRs of the donor antibody with a human framework. In certain<br>
embodiments, it may be desirable to generate amino acid sequence variants of the humanized<br>
antibody, particularly where these improve the binding affinity or other properties of the<br>
humanized antibody. The methods applied to select sites for substitution, insertion or deletion,<br>
from both the donor BAT-1 antibody and the selected human acceptor antibody, including the<br>
selection of acceptor human antibodies are described in detail. The extensive analysis and<br>
guidelines for antibody humanization which is provided hereinbelow, is not disclosed in the<br>
background art and is crucial for the preparation of an active altered antibody.<br>
The design of a humanized antibody is preferably initiated by sequence analysis of the<br>
heavy and light chains of the non-human antibody variable region, also termed hereinafter Vh<br>
and Vl, respectively. Such analysis includes a comparison between the amino acid sequence of<br>
Vl and Vh of the non-humanized antibody and other mouse variable regions. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the comparison can be further conducted with consensus sequences of the<br>
subgroups into which the variable regions were subdivided in the Kabat database (Kabat et al.,<br>
ibid). The classification of the different elements of the variable region facilitates selection of<br>
immunoglobulin variable regions which are similar to the Vl and Vh of the non-humanized<br>
antibody of the present invention and are structurally solved.<br>
Selection of the human kappa light chain variable region, also termed hereinafter Vk, and<br>
of Vh that would serve as the basis of the variable region of the humanized antibody, also<br>
termed an acceptor antibody, is preferably initiated by classifying the Vl and Vh of the non<br>
human antibody according to consensus sequences of human irnmunoglobulins. Particularly, Vl<br>
of the non-humanized antibody is compared with and consequently categorized according to the<br>
consensus sequences of the four human kappa light chain variable region subgroups as defined<br>
by Kabat (Kabat et al., ibid). Similarly, VH of the non-humanized antibody is compared and<br>
categorized according to the consensus sequences of the three human heavy chain variable<br>
region subgroups.<br>
The selection of the acceptor human Vk and Vh is preferably proceeded by conducting a<br>
comparison between Vl and Vh of the parental non-human antibody of the invention and all the<br>
recorded examples of individual sequences of human variable regions publicly available. An<br>
appropriate human Vk and Vh are selected on the basis of closest match to the parental non-<br>
human antibody.<br>
Analysis of the sequences of the donor and humanized antibodies and reference to<br>
appropriate molecular models can help to discern which residues might be involved in antigen<br>
binding or maintenance of proper antibody structure and which residues should be removed or<br>
substituted in order to improve the structure of the humanized antibody.<br>
Molecular models of the variable regions of both the non-human and humanized<br>
antibodies are thus prepared to assist the design of the humanized antibody. The modeling of<br>
these structures are based on the classifications of the variable region elements that were<br>
determined in the analysis procedure and can be obtained, for example, by using homology and<br>
ab initio techniques. The corresponding X-ray crystallographic structures can be obtained from<br>
the Brookhaven database.<br>
Elements within the variable region of the non-human antibody of the invention, such as<br>
FRs, CDRs, and loop structures, are modeled on elements from similar, structurally solved,<br>
immunoglobulin variable regions. Steric clashes are identified in the models and consequently<br>
mismatched side-chains are selected for substitution. A particularly preferred approach for<br>
structure conformation includes categorization of the structural elements according to canonical<br>
classes based on those described by Chothia and his colleagues (Chotbia et al., 1987,1989,1992<br>
ibid; Tramontano et al., ibid). A preferred approach for structure prediction includes a database<br>
search or CONGEN search (Bruccoleri, R.E. et al., Biopofymers 26:137., 1987). The selected<br>
human Vk and Vh that would serve as the basis of the humanized antibody are similarly<br>
modeled and their amino acid sequences are studied to determine if any of their residues are<br>
likely to adversely influence binding specificity.<br>
Energy minimization is preferably applied after adjusting the models for obvious steric<br>
clashes. Energy minimization is implemented here both to relieve unfavorable atomic contacts<br>
and to optimize van der Waals and electrostatic interaction.<br>
As a result of the above design procedure the humanized antibody variants of BAT-1 may<br>
comprise additional, or substituted conservative amino acid residues which are not found in the<br>
recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. Deletion of amino acid residues included in the<br>
original acceptor or donor antibodies may also be applied. These modifications are made to<br>
refine antibody performance and have substantially no effect on antigen binding or other<br>
irrrmunoglobulin functions. The sites of greatest interest for modifications include the<br>
hypervariable loops, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Hypervariable region residues or<br>
FR residues involved in antigen binding are generally substituted in a relatively conservative<br>
manner. The conservative substitutions that may be applied in the present invention comprise<br>
the following options: Val, Ile; Ser, Thr; Lys, Arg; Phe, Tyr; Trp, Leu; Asp, Ser; Cys, Thr; Gln,<br>
Lys; Val, Ala; Asn, Ser; Thr, Asn.<br>
(iii) Construction of the humanized antibody variants<br>
Generally, the BAT-1 antibody variants are conventionally prepared in recombinant cell<br>
culture, as described in more detail below. Recombinant synthesis is preferred here but it is<br>
known to prepare peptides by chemical synthesis or to purify them from natural sources.<br>
Molecular biology techniques and CDR grafting protocols suitable to carrying out the<br>
invention as herein described are known to those skilled in the art. Suitable teachings are<br>
described in numerous manuals and primary publications, including inter alia, Sambrook et al,<br>
(Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor, New York, 1989); Ausubel et al., (Protocols In Molecular Biology, Green<br>
Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley and Sons, New York 19S7, 1988,<br>
1989); US Patent Nos. 5,225,539 and 5,585,089 which are herein incorporated by reference in<br>
their entirety including supplements.<br>
The amino acid sequences of BAT-1 light and heavy chain CDRs are herein identified and<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5 and 6: CDRL1 (SEQ. ID NO. 9 and SEQ L1 in FIG.5): SARSS VSYMH;<br>
CDRl2 (SEQ. ID NO. 10 and SEQ L2 in FIG.5): RTSNL AS; CDRL3 (SEQ. ID NO. 11 and<br>
SEQ L3 in FIG.5): QQRSS FPLT; CDRH1 (SEQ. ID NO. 12 and SEQ H1 in FIG.6): NYGMN;<br>
CDRh2 (SEQ. ID NO. 13 and SEQ H2 in FIG.6): WINTD SGEST YAEEF KG; CDRH3 (SEQ.<br>
ED NO. 14 and SEQ H3 in FIG.6): VGYDA LDY.<br>
Using these ammo acid sequences, oligonucleotides encoding these CDRs can be<br>
synthesized for use in the present invention. Also, the oligonucleotides may contain nucleotides<br>
in addition to those of BAT-1 CDRs, to facilitate cloning or to introduce restriction sites, for<br>
instance. Oligonucleotide synthesis techniques suitable to this aspect of the invention are well<br>
known to the skilled artisan and may be carried out using any of several commercially available<br>
automated synthesizers. In addition, DNAs encoding the CDRs set forth herein can be obtained<br>
through the services of commercial DNA synthesis vendors. It is thus not necessary to redone<br>
BAT-1 CDRs from a natural source.<br>
mBAT-1 CDRs are grafted into a human antibody to produce the humanized BAT-1<br>
variants. It will be understood that human antibody in this context refers to any antibody that<br>
occurs in a human or an engineered antibody that has been designed, in some respect, to be<br>
compatible with the human immune system. Particularly preferred for this purpose are<br>
antibodies that, broadly, do not engender an adverse immune response in a patient.<br>
To construct CDR-grafted humanized BAT-1 antibodies, oligonucleotides encoding the<br>
.BAT-1 CDRs can be integrated into other DNAs encoding antibody heavy and light chains and<br>
fragments thereof, using well-known recombinant techniques such as those described hi the<br>
above references. Particularly, BAT-1 CDRs can be introduced into practically any set of FRs<br>
in accordance with the present invention. A variety of human antibody genes are available in the<br>
form of publicly accessible deposits and suitable antibody genes can be synthesized from these<br>
sequences much as described above. Preferred techniques employed in this regard, for cloning<br>
and manipulating polynucleotides are illustrated by the methods and examples set forth.<br>
The amino acid sequences of mBAT-1 and reshaped BAT-1 light (FIG. 5) and heavy<br>
(FIG.6) chain FRs and modified FRs are herein identified: FRL1 (SEQ. ID NO. 1): ECVLT<br>
QSPSS LSASV GDRVT ITC; FRL2 (SEQ. ID NO. 2): WXaaQQK PGKAP KLXbbI Y,<br>
wherein Xaa =-F, Y and Xbb = W, L;FRl3 (SEQ. PD NO. 3): GVPSR FSGSG SGTXaaXbb<br>
XcoLTPN SLQPE DFATY YC, wherein Xaa = D, S; Xbb = Y, F and Xcc== C, T; FRL4 (SEQ. ID<br>
NO. 4): FGGGT EXEPK; FRHi (SEQ. ID NO. 5): QXaaQLV QSGSE LKKPG ASVKI SCKAS<br>
GYXbbFXcc, wherein Xaa = I, V; Xbb = T, S; Xcc = T, S; FRh2 (SEQ. ID NO. 6); WVXaaQA<br>
PGQGL XbbXbbWMG, wherein Xaa = R, K; FRH3 (SEQ. ID NO. 7): RFXaaFS LDTSV XbbTAYL<br>
QITSL XccAEDT GMYFC XddXee, wherein Xaa = V, A; Xbb = N, S; Xcc = T, N; Xdd = V,<br>
A; Xee = R, K; FRH4 (SEQ. ID NO. 8): WGQGT LVTVS S.<br>
The oligonucleotides encodingthe BAT-1 CDRs and/or specific FR residues originated<br>
from human antibodies may be used to introduce codons into the DNA encoding Vk or Vh of<br>
the humanized BAT-1 variants. In accordance with this aspect of the invention the additional<br>
codons may include those not derived from BAT-1 CDR as well as those that make up the CDR.<br>
These additional bases may be included to facilitate joining the CDR to the FRs from a<br>
heterologous source. They may comprise restriction sites or overlapping complementary regions<br>
for this purpose. The template DNAs are typically single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) vectors.<br>
The CDRs of the BAT-1 heavy and light chains may also be modified particularly after<br>
incorporation into a humanized antibody using well-known recombinant DNA techniques for<br>
deleting, inserting and altering bases in a cloned or synthetic DNA or RNA. Site-specific<br>
mutagenesis techniques suitable to this end are well known to those of skill in the art, and are<br>
illustrated in the foregoing references on recombinant DNA techniques. These methods can be<br>
used to introduce practically any desired alteration into polynucleotides that encode the BAT-1<br>
¦CDRs or into other regions of a closed heavy or light chain gene.<br>
The synthesis of longer, double-stranded DNAs from shorter, overlapping, single-stranded<br>
DNAs is well known to those of skill in the art. Likewise, well known is the end-to-end joining<br>
of DNAs, including blunt-ended DNAs and those with at least partially overlapping<br>
complementary termini. These techniques are illustrated in the foregoing references on<br>
recombinant DNA techniques, for instance.<br>
The construction of all versions of the human BAT-1 variable region is preferably carried<br>
out as described by Stemmer (Stemmer et al., GENE 164:49, 1995). Essentially, this method is<br>
favored for the synthesis of long DNA sequences from large numbers of<br>
oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos). The method relies on DNA polymerase using conventional<br>
PCR technique, to build increasingly longer DNA fragments during assembly process. Once the<br>
new variable region gene is synthesized it is preferentially subcloned into a vector which is<br>
transformed into competent cells as described in the above references. Putative positive clones<br>
can be identified by PCR-screening using appropriate primers and/or by restriction digest.<br>
Individual clones selected from the confirmed positive clones may be sequenced to double-<br>
stranded-DNA (ds-DNA). Preferably, the resultant ds-DNAs can be rechecked for PCR-induced<br>
errors, by sequencing, and corrected by subcloning correct fragments from other clones.<br>
DNA of selected clones, from the confirmed positive clone, containing the humanized Vk<br>
or Vh of the BAT-1 variant may be directly inserted into expression vectors which comprise<br>
human light and heavy constant regions, respectively. Once DNA encoding the humanized<br>
BAT-1 CDR-grafted complete antibody variant, or the light or the heavy chain regions of the<br>
humanized BAT-1 CDR-grafted antibody, has been assembled, it may be inserted into a vector<br>
for propagation and expression by conventional techniques. In this manner desired amounts of<br>
the antibody may be obtained.<br>
(iv) Expression of the humanized BAT-1 antibody variants<br>
The invention also provides isolated polynucleotide sequences encoding the complete<br>
humanized BAT-1 antibody, the light chain complete or variable region, heavy chain complete<br>
or variable region sequence, as well as vectors and host cells comprising the coding nucleic acid.<br>
For recombinant production of the BAT-1 antibody, the polynucleotide sequence encoding<br>
said antibody or its fragments, is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further<br>
cloning, amplification or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and<br>
sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable<br>
of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many<br>
vectors are available which generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the<br>
following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer<br>
element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.<br>
For expression, the polynucleotide encoding the humanized BAT-1 antibody or fragments<br>
thereof, may be cloned into an expression vector. Such vectors are well known to those skilled<br>
in the art. An expression control sequence, such as an immunoglobulin or viral promoter, is<br>
introduced upstream of the polynucleotide. Selection markers such as the dhfr gene, or other<br>
suitable selectable marker well known to those skilled in the art, are included in the vector to<br>
allow selection of host cells which are expressing the said polynucleotide included on the vector.<br>
In one embodiment, the host cell endogenously produces antibodies, while in an<br>
alternative embodiment, the cell is genetically modified to produce antibodies. Examples of<br>
cells that endogenously produce antibodies include, but are not limited to hybridomas,<br>
lymphomas, plasmacytomas and EBV transformed cells. A cell can be genetically modified to<br>
produce antibodies by conventional methods, such as by transfection with a vector encoding an<br>
antibody molecule.<br>
In use, the expression vector comprising the polynucleotide encoding the humanized BAT-<br>
1 antibody or fragments thereof, is transfected into cells. Transfection methods are well known<br>
in the art and such methods are suitable for employment in the present invention. The cells<br>
expressing the expression vector are selected using the selectable marker incorporated into the<br>
expression vector or a vector used for co-transfection. Cells expressing the antibody can be<br>
screened by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) assays or other suitable methods<br>
well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The humanized BAT-1 antibody variants are introduced into a host cell by transfection of<br>
a vector comprising polynucleotide encoding the complete or Fv fragment of the antibody.<br>
Humanized BAT-1 antibody variants is also introduced into a host cells by co-transfection of: (i)<br>
a vector comprising polynucleotide encoding the variable or complete light chain region of the<br>
antibody and (ii) a vector comprising polynucleotide encoding the variable or complete heavy<br>
chain region of the antibody.<br>
hi a most preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is produced by a<br>
transfection of a single vector comprising polynucleotide sequences encoding the light and<br>
heavy variable regions of the antibody. Most preferably, this vector further comprises two<br>
promoters, each operatively linked to the polynucleotide sequence encoding the light chain and<br>
the heavy chain regions of reshaped BAT-1. The resulting expression of the BAT-1 antibody is<br>
higher than its expression following co-transfection with two vectors, each encoding the light<br>
chain or heavy chain regions, of the antibody, whereas the transfection and co-transfection being<br>
conducted in a similar host cell.<br>
The humanized BAT-1 antibody variants can be expressed in any suitable cell type,<br>
including but not limited to mammalian, avian, insect, bacterial or yeast cells. Examples of<br>
mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, human, rabbit, rodent (e.g., mouse, rat) and<br>
bovine cells. In preferred embodiments, the cell is a myeloma cell, a Chinese hamster ovary<br>
(CHO) cell, COS cell, COS7 cell or fibroblast.<br>
Antibody-producing cell lines may be cultured using techniques well known to the<br>
skilled artisan. Such techniques are described in a variety of laboratory manuals and primary<br>
publications. For instance, techniques suitable for use in the invention as described below are<br>
described in current protocols in immunology, Coligan et al., (Green Publishing Associates and<br>
Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. 1991) which is herein incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety, including supplements.<br>
The humanized monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be frozen or lyophilized for<br>
storage and reconstituted in a suitable carrier prior to use. This technique has been shown to be<br>
effective with conventional immune globulins and art-known lyopbilization and reconstitution<br>
techniques can be employed. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that lyopbilization<br>
and reconstitution can lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss and that use levels may<br>
have to be adjusted to compensate.<br>
(v) Purification of humanized BAT-1 antibody<br>
Using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced ixttracellularly, in the<br>
periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced<br>
intracelmlarly, as a first step the participate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is<br>
removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al., (Biotechnology .10:163,<br>
1992) describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space<br>
of E. coli. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and<br>
phenylmethylsulfonylfiuoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by<br>
centrifugation.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is secreted into the medium,<br>
supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially<br>
available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore ultrafiltration unit. A<br>
protease inhibitor may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and<br>
antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.<br>
The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using methods well<br>
known in the art, for example, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and<br>
affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography particularly with protein A, being a<br>
preferred purification technique. The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often<br>
agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices, such as controlled pore<br>
glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene, allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times<br>
than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody-comprises a CH3 domain, the Bakerbond<br>
ABX™ resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for<br>
protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation,<br>
reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™,<br>
chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column),<br>
chromatofocusing, SDS-page, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending<br>
on the antibody to be recovered.<br>
(vi) Deposit Of Cell Line<br>
According to a representative embodiment of the present invention the humanized BAT<br>
monoclonal antibodies are identical in their function or activity to those produced by cells<br>
deposited under ATCC # (PTA-5189), on May 9,2003.<br>
IIL Pharmacology<br>
(i) Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
The invention also provides a composition comprising the antibody of the invention.<br>
According to another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising as an active ingredient the antibody of the invention, for use in<br>
diagnosis and therapy. Said compositions may be in any pharmaceutical form suitable for<br>
administration to a patient, including but not limited to solutions, suspensions, lyophilized<br>
powders for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle or dilution prior to usage, capsules and tablets.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed in this invention may further comprise any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier to provide a physiologicalry acceptable<br>
conjugates comprising the antibodies with therapeutic agents for diagnosis, prognosis and<br>
therapy, among others.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes<br>
well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, grinding,<br>
pulverizing, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizmg<br>
processes.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus may be<br>
formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers<br>
comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active compounds into<br>
preparations which, can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the<br>
route of administration chosen.<br>
For injection, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions,<br>
preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or<br>
physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the<br>
barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants, for example polyethylene<br>
glycol, are generally known in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally,<br>
include push-fit capsules.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the molecules for use according to the present invention<br>
are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized pack<br>
or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
trichlorofluoromethane, dichloro-tetrafluoroethane or carbon dioxide, hi the case of a<br>
pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a<br>
metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator, may<br>
be formulated containing a powder mix of the polypeptide and a suitable powder base such as<br>
lactose or starch.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of<br>
the active ingredients in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds<br>
may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable natural or synthetic carriers<br>
are well known in the art. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or<br>
agents, which increase the solubility of the compounds, to allow for the preparation of highly<br>
concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for<br>
reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include<br>
compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve the<br>
intended purpose. All formulations for administration should be in dosages suitable for the<br>
chosen route of administration. More specifically, a "therapeutically effective" dose means an<br>
amount of a compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of a disease of the<br>
subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the<br>
capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided<br>
herein.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compositions described herein can be determined<br>
by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by<br>
determining the IC50 (the concentration which provides 50% inhibition) and the maximal<br>
tolerated dose for a subject compound. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and<br>
animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage may<br>
vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The<br>
exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician<br>
in view of the patient's condition. Depending on the severity and responsiveness of the<br>
condition to be treated, dosing can also be a single administration of a slow release composition,<br>
with course of treatment lasting from several days to several weeks or until cure is effected or<br>
diminution of the disease state is achieved. The amount of a composition to be administered<br>
will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the<br>
manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, and all other relevant<br>
factors.<br>
(ii) Methods of treatment<br>
Antibodies in accordance with the invention, while being useful for a variety of therapeutic<br>
indications, are used, in accordance with a currently preferred embodiment of the invention, for<br>
the treatment of cancer. It has been found that a monoclonal antibody in accordance with the<br>
invention elicits anti-tumor effects in a variety of tumors. Within the scope of the present<br>
invention, methods are provided for the use of the novel hBAT-1 for the treatment of tumor by<br>
administering to a subject an effective amount of the antibody of the invention. The term<br>
"effective amount" should be understood as meaning an amount of an antibody required to<br>
achieve a therapeutic effect. The effective amount required to achieve the therapeutic end result<br>
may depend on a number of factors including, for example, the tumor type and the severity of<br>
the patient's condition (i.e. the cancerous state), and whether the antibody is co-administered<br>
together with another agent which acts together with the antibody in an additive or synergistic<br>
manner. The antibody may be administered either following detection of primary or secondary<br>
tumors in the subject or, as preventive therapy of a subject having a high risk of developing<br>
cancers, such as an individual exposed to radiation or such having a genetic pre-disposition.<br>
The invention additionally provides a method of treating a subject in need thereof, with a<br>
humanized BAT-1 antibody variant or with a composition that comprises said antibody as an<br>
active ingredient.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for<br>
diagnosis or treatment of a disease or a disorder, particularly cancer, comprising administering<br>
to a subject in need thereof, an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
the antibody of the invention as an active ingredient.<br>
The method of treatment comprises administering an antibody or composition of the<br>
invention to a subject. The method of treatment also comprises administration an antibody or<br>
composition of the invention to a subject in parallel to, prior to, or following treatment with an<br>
additional active composition comprising cytokines such as IL-1 (mterleulcen-1), IL -2, IL -6<br>
and FN-a (interferon-a) or other antibodies, such as any T-cell stimulatory antibody or other<br>
anti-tumor therapeutic antibody. In one embodiment, the subject is a human. In another<br>
embodiment the disease to be prevented, treated or detected is cancer.<br>
The administration of said compositions can be typically achieved by means of parenteral<br>
administration, e.g., intravenously (i.v.) mtraperitoneally (i.p.) or intramuscularly (i.m.).<br>
Methods of treatment may comprise pharmaceutical compositions of the antibodies according to<br>
the invention. Alternatively or additionally, methods of treatment may include cell therapy, ex-<br>
vivo or in-vivo wherein cells are autologous or allogeneic.<br>
In order to boost the anti-tumor activity of the antibody, it is at times advantageous to<br>
administer the antibody of the invention together with, prior to, or following, the administration<br>
of other agents, which can act in an additive or synergistic manner with it. Examples comprise<br>
various cytokines, including but not limited to IL-1 (Interleuken-1), 11,-2, IL-6 and IFN-a<br>
(Interferon-a), as well as cell vaccines or additional antibodies, including but not limited to T-<br>
cell stimulatory antibodies, or anti-tumor therapeutic antibodies.<br>
The antibody of the invention may be useful in the therapy of a variety of diseases other<br>
than cancer where activation or other effects of the antibody on the immune system's<br>
proliferative, cytolytic or stimulatory activity may have a therapeutic effect, such as, for<br>
example, in early stages of HIV infection or in patients whose blood count shows a decrease in<br>
CD4+ T cells (the causative virus of AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), in various<br>
autoimmune disorders, or in some cases of genetic or acquired immune deficiencies. In AIDS<br>
patients, the antibody may be administered to infected individuals, which have not yet<br>
developed any symptoms of the disease, or in individuals at early stages of the HIV infection<br>
process.<br>
The dose of the antibody or composition to be administrated to a subject, in the context of<br>
the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the<br>
subject over time, or to inhibit tumor growth. Thus, the antibody or composition may be<br>
administered to a subject in an amount sufficient to alleviate, reduce, cure or at least partially<br>
arrest the disease.<br>
The dose will be determined by the activity of the therapeutic composition produced and<br>
the condition of the subject, as well as the body weight or surface area of the subject to be<br>
treated. The size of the dose and the dosing regiment also will be determined by the existence,<br>
nature, and extent of any adverse side effects that accompany the administration of a particular<br>
therapeutic composition in a particular subject. la determining the effective amount of the<br>
therapeutic composition to be administered, the physician needs to evaluate circulating plasma<br>
levels, toxicity, and progression of the disease.<br>
Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood<br>
through reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are<br>
not intended to be limiting of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Sequence analysis of the mouse BAT-1 kappa light chain variable region (Vk)<br>
The DNA and amino acid sequences of the BAT-1 Vk region is shown in FIG. 1. The<br>
amino acid sequences were compared with other mouse variable regions and also with the<br>
consensus sequences of the subgroups that the variable regions were subdivided into in the<br>
Kabat database (Kabat et al., ibid). From this analysis the BAT-1 Vk region was found to most<br>
closely match the consensus sequences of both mouse kappa subgroup IV (Identity = 88.38%;<br>
Similarity = 92.45) and mouse kappa subgroup VI (Identity = 87.74%; Similarity = 89.62).<br>
When only the FRs of the BAT- 1 kappa light chain variable region (i.e. without the amino acids<br>
in the CDRs) were compared to mouse subgroups IV and VI, percentage identity increased to<br>
exactly 90.00% for both, while percentage similarity rose to 92.50%, again for both consensus<br>
sequences. However, despite the close similarities to both Kabat subgroups, it was decided that<br>
the murine BAT-1 Vk region should be classed as mouse subgroup VI.<br>
The reason for the selection of mouse subgroup VI was related to the canonical classes of<br>
the hypervariable loops of the BAT-1 Vk region, as defined by Chothia and his co-workers<br>
(Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901, 1987; Nature 34:877, 1989; J. Mol. Biol. 227:799, 1992;<br>
Tramontano et al., ibid). According to Chothia, each of the CDRs: CDR1 (L1), CDR2 (L2) and<br>
CDR3 (L3), were canonical class 1 (FIG. 2). Crucially, the 10 amino acid canonical class 1 L1<br>
hypervariable loop was only seen in mouse Vk regions which fitted Kabat subgroup VI.<br>
Most restrictive canonical classes for the CDR related loops structures have more recently<br>
been defined by Martin and Thornton (Martin et al, ibid) and these too are described in FIG. 2.<br>
The utility of these new canonical class definitions lies in their stringency, which in turn is<br>
related to the presence of a greater number of so-called framework canonical residues in each<br>
class. The importance of these "extra", potentially key, residues was later considered when<br>
designing the humanized BAT-1 antibody. Loops LI and L2 were easily assigned to Martins<br>
canonical classes 1/10A and 1/7A, respectively, however, the L3 loop did not perfectly match<br>
any of the classes available to it. The class that it most closely matched was class 1/9A,<br>
however, to fit this class there had to be residue at position 28 in the Vk region of BAT-1, which<br>
is not actually present. The closest mouse kappa light chain variable region germline gene to<br>
BAT-1 Vk was H4, which also contained a 10 amino acid LI loop (Table 1). Only 12<br>
mismatches were found between the H4 germline sequence and the BAT-1 Vk region. The<br>
majority of these mismatches were positioned in the CDRs with only four differences located in<br>
the FRs. Most of these mismatches were highly conservative changes, except for the cysteine at<br>
position 72 (Kabat numbering) in FR3. Its location immediately adjacent to an important<br>
canonical residue (position 71) suggested that the cysteine may have a key role in antigen<br>
binding. Nevertheless, taken together, the above example clearly suggested that the BAT-1<br>
sequence was typical of a mouse Vk variable region.<br>
Example 2<br>
Sequence analysis of the mouse BAT-1 heavy chain variable region<br>
The DNA and amino acid sequences of the BAT-1 Vh region is shown in FIG. 3. An<br>
analysis similar to that given in Example 1 was conducted for the BAT-1 Vh region which<br>
determined that it exhibited the closest match to the consensus seance of the mouse heavy<br>
chain miscellaneous subgroup in the Kabat database (Kabat et al., IDID). Identity between the<br>
mouse heavy chain variable region amino acid sequence of mBAT-1 and the consensus<br>
sequences of the miscellaneous subgroup was measured at 60.64% while the similarity was<br>
calculated to be 69.23%, with the next closest Kabat subgroup consensus sequences being<br>
subgroup IIa (Identity = 59.83%; Similarity = 66.67%). However, when, only the FRs of the<br>
BAT-1 Vh region was compared to mouse subgroup IIa. percentage identity decreased to<br>
54.02% while the similarity dropped to 62.06%. Conversely, the same comparisons carried out<br>
against the mouse miscellaneous subgroup found the FRs of the BAT-1 VH region exhibited a<br>
65.52% identity and a 74.71% similarity.<br>
When the canonical classes of the hypervariable loops of the BAT-1 VH region, as defined<br>
by Chothia and his co-workers, were analyzed (FIG. 4) the CDR1 and CDR2 loops (HI)<br>
matched Chothia canonical class 1 loops. However, no class was assigned to the CDR3 loop<br>
structure (H3) due to the wide range of size and amino acid make-up that H3 loops can display.<br>
Using the more stringent canonical classes for CDR loop structures defined by Martin and<br>
Thornton (Martin et al., ibid) it was a straight forward matter to determine that the HI loop<br>
matched Martin canonical class 1/10A. However, for the H2 loop it was more difficult to assign<br>
class, although the closest Martin canonical class was Class 2/10A. Unfortunately, since the<br>
amino acid Asp53 in the H2 loop did not match the expected residues for this position (i.e. Ala,<br>
Gly, Tyr, Ser, Lys, Thr or Asn), the match was also not perfect.<br>
The closest mouse heavy chain variable region germline gene to mBAT-1 VH identified was<br>
VMS2/VGK4 (Table 2). Thus the above example clearly suggested that the mBAT-1 sequence<br>
was typical of a mouse Vh variable region.<br>

the absence of amino acid<br>
Example 3<br>
Design of the humanized BAT-1 Vk antibody variants<br>
The first step in the design of the humanized variable regions of the BAT-1 antibody was<br>
the selection of the human kappa light chain variable region that would serve as the basis of the<br>
humanized BAT-1 Vk region. As an aid to this process the BAT-1 Vk region was initially<br>
compared to the consensus sequences of the four human kappa light chain variable region<br>
subgroups as defined by Kabat and his coworkers (Kabat et al., ibid).<br>
The mouse BAT-1 light chain variable region was most similar to the consensus sequences<br>
of human kappa light chain subgroup I and human kappa light chain subgroup III. In the case of<br>
human kappa light chain subgroup I the mouse BAT-1 Vk region displayed a 63.21% identity<br>
over the whole variable region and a 70.00% identity within the FRs alone. When measured<br>
with respect to similarity, these values increased to 71.70% overall and 80.00% within the FRs<br>
alone. In the case of human kappa light chain subgroup III the mouse BAT-1 Vk region<br>
displayed a 65.09% identity over the whole variable region and a 68.75% identity within the<br>
FRs alone. When measured with respect to similarity, these values increased to 74.53% overall<br>
and 80.00% within the FRs alone. Consequently, it generally appeared to match well a broad<br>
range of human kappa light chain variable region sequences, however, with respect to FRs in<br>
particular, it was marginally more identical to those found within human kappa light chain<br>
subgroup I.<br>
The mouse BAT-1 Vk region was then compared to all the recorded examples of<br>
individual sequences of human variable regions publicly available. Table 3 shows the best<br>
fifteen matches to the mouse BAT-1 Vk region which were identified through this analysis.<br>
Overall, the search algorithm selected the human Vk region from antibody TEL9 (Marks et al.,<br>
J. Mol. Biol. 222:581, 1991) as the closest match to the mouse BAT-1 Vk region (Table 4). This<br>
human sequence had an overall identity to the BAT-1 Vk region of 67.93% overall and 72.50%<br>
within the FRs alone. When measured with respect to similarity, these values increased to<br>
77.36% overall and 82.50% within the FRs alone. Consequently, the TEL9 kappa light chain<br>
variable region FR was selected as the human acceptor sequence for the humanization of the<br>
BAT-1 antibody kappa light chain variable region. This then became the basis of the first<br>
humanized version of the BAT-1 kappa light chain (BATRka), which essentially comprised the<br>
CDRs of the BAT-1 Vk region and the FRs of the TEL9 Vk region.<br>
The next step in the design process was to study the amino acid sequences of the human<br>
acceptor TEL9 VK region FRs to determine if any of these amino acid residues were likely to<br>
adversely influence binding to antigen, either directly through interactions with antigen, or<br>
indirectly by altering the conformation or orientation of the CDR loops. This was a difficult<br>
process which was only made possible through the availability of a model of the BAT-1 variable<br>
regions i.e. both the Vk and Vh regions. The modeling procedure will be given in detail in<br>
Example 5. Nevertheless, any amino acid in the mouse BAT-1 FRs which did appear to affect<br>
antigen binding were then considered for conservation in the humanized BAT-1 antibody. In<br>
deciding which murine residues to conserve the following points were addressed:<br>
2 A dot [.] refers to a match between BAT Vk and the mouse gennline Vk, a line [-] refers to the<br>
absence of amino acid, underlined residues in the human Vk sequences differ from their closest<br>
human Vk gene<br>
3S/C refers to amino acids positioned within 5A of a CDR on the Surface or Core of Fv and s/c to<br>
amino acids positioned further away than 5 A of a CDR on the surface or core of Fv<br>
4 v refers to Vernier residues (Footer et al., J. Mol. Biol. 224:487, 1992) located in the FRs<br>
1ID - percentage identity of the human Vk sequences to the tnurine BAT Vk region 2All -<br>
number of identical residues in the whole of the human Vk region when compared to the<br>
whole of the murine BAT Vk region<br>
3Surface (FR Surface) - number of identical (FR) residues on the surface<br>
4Core (FR Core) - number of identical residues within the (FR) core of the Fv domain<br>
5CDR/FR - number of identical residues within the CDRs or the FRs;<br>
FR Near CDR - represents the number of identical residues amongst the FR amino acids<br>
within 5A of a CDR;<br>
Vernier - number of identical residues amongst the 14 Vernier amino acids (Foote et al.,<br>
ibid);<br>
8 Vk (J Chain) - number of identical residues within the Vk (J Chain) gene<br>
9L1 to L3 Size - number of residues in each CDR<br>
10L1 to L3 Class - Canonical class of the CDR according to Martin &amp; Thornton (Martin et al.,<br>
ibid)<br>
a. It was of great importance that the canonical structures for the hypervariable loops<br>
(Chothia et al., 1987, 1989, 1992 ibid; Tramontano et al., ibid) were conserved.<br>
Consequently, it was crucial to conserve in the humanized BAT-1 variable regions all the<br>
mouse FR residues that were part of these canonical structures.<br>
b. The sequences of the mBAT-1 antibody variable regions were compared to similar<br>
sequences from other mouse antibodies to identify unusual or rare residues - which may<br>
have indicated an important role in antigen binding. This was then investigated using the<br>
model of the BAT-1 variable region genes.<br>
c. A direct analysis of the model was alsol made to try and predict whether any of the other<br>
mouse FR residues not present in the Humanized FRs could influence antigen binding in<br>
some way.<br>
d. Comparisons of the individual human acceptor sequences for the kappa light and heavy<br>
chain variable regions to the consensus sequence of human variable regions subgroups to<br>
which the acceptor sequences belonged were also made. The identification of any<br>
idiosyncratic amino acids in the human donor sequences was important as these could<br>
have adversely affected antigen binding.<br>
e. Since the human light and heavy chain variable regions selected would be derived from<br>
two different human antibodies (see Example 4 for the selection of the human Vh acceptor<br>
sequence), a careful analysis of the interdomain packing residues of both the donor and<br>
acceptor kappa light variable regions should be carried out. This was because any miss-<br>
packing in this region could have had a dramatic affect upon antigen binding, irrespective<br>
of the conformation of the CDR loop structures of the humanized BAT-1 antibody,<br>
f. By following this design process, a number of amino acids in the rrmrine BAT-1 Vk FRs<br>
were identified for conservation in the second version (BATRkb) of the humanized BAT-1<br>
antibody (Table 5). Table 5 provides alignment of amino acid sequences leading to the<br>
design of the first (BATRka) and second (BATRkb) reshaped human versions of the BAT-<br>
1 antibody kappa light chain variable region. There were 21 amino acid differences<br>
between the FRs of the donor mouse BAT-1 Vk region and the acceptor human TEL9 Vk<br>
region. However, there were only five residues in the humanized FRs where it was<br>
considered necessary to change the amino acid present in the human FRs to the amino acid<br>
present in the original mouse FRs.<br>
The Vk region amino acids, located at the Vk/Vh interface as defined by Chothia and<br>
colleagues (Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 186:651, 1985), were checked for unusual or rare<br>
residues. From this analysis, the only residue position that raised any level of concern was the<br>
Phe at position 36 (Phe36) in FR2. Tyr (as found in TEL9) was normally seen at this position,<br>
however, in mBAT-1 Phe was present, In addition, position 36 was a recognized position for a<br>
Vernier amino acid (Foote et al., ibid). Vernier residues were thought to be important for<br>
maintaining CDR loop conformation. Moreover, Phe was not commonly seen in Kabat mouse<br>
subgroup VI (21/153) while Tyr was very commonly seen in both mouse subgroup VI (131/153) and<br>
human subgroup I (66/74) (Kabat et al., ibid). Consequently, a Tyr36Phe change was thought to<br>
be appropriate, both to mimic the interdomain packing found in BAT-1, between the two<br>
heterologous human acceptor variable regions, and also to maintain CDR loop conformation.<br>
A second change was also decided upon at position 47 in FR2. The highly conserved Leu<br>
found in the human TEL9 kappa light chain variable region was changed to a Trp, as found in<br>
the mouse BAT-1 kappa light chain variable region. Position 47 was another recognized Vernier<br>
residue position and was also located near the VH interface according to the molecular model, In<br>
particular, it was close to Ala55 in H2 and may have been interacting with it. Therefore,<br>
although Trp was never seen at this core residue position in human VH sequences, it was felt<br>
prudent to conserve it in BATRkb by making the Leu47Trp modification.<br>
The third FR change introduced into BATRkb was located at position 7-1, which as well as<br>
being identified as a Vernier residue position (Foote et al, ibid), was also recognized as being<br>
one of the important canonical residue positions for the L1 loop stmcture. These canonical<br>
residues were defined by Chothia and his co-workers (Chothia et al.., 1987, 1989, 1992 ibid;<br>
Tramontano et al., ibid) as being vital for the conservation of the CDR loop structure. Many of<br>
the canonical amino acids were located within the CDRs, however, a number (such as 71Tyr)<br>
were also positioned within the FRs. Although the amino acid change was conservative, the<br>
Phe71Tyr change was considered critical for the successful huinanization of the BAT-1 kappa<br>
light chain.<br>
Other versions of the humanized Vk region are:<br>
BATRkc: Cys and Ser are similar in size and character, and from the model both amino<br>
acids at position 72 in FR3 appeared to be reasonably buried and pointing away from the LI<br>
loop. However, in the case of the Cys amino acid the sulphur side-chain is exposed, according to<br>
the model, whereas according to the Kabat database (Kabat et al., ibid) the presence of Cys at<br>
this position is a unique event and Ser is commonly seen at this position (421/1234). Consequently,<br>
BATRkc contained the changes at Tyr36Phe, Leu47Trp and Phe71Tyr (as in BATRkb) plus the<br>
Ser72Cys modification to the Vk FRs residues of the acceptor TEL9 antibody.<br>
BATRko: Evidence from the murine BAT-1 Fv model suggests that the surface exposed<br>
70Ser is a residue which may interact with the LI loop. In the human TEL9 kappa light chain<br>
the amino acid at this position is Asp, which is larger than Ser and positively charged. Ser is<br>
never seen at this position in human Vk regions (Asp being by far the most common amino<br>
acid). The proximity to the L1 loop and the surface exposed nature of 70Ser tentatively<br>
suggested that it may be either interacting with L1 or even the antigen directly. Consequently, it<br>
was decided to make the Asp70Ser change in BATRkd, which was otherwise identical to<br>
BATRkc.<br>
A description of the amino acid sequences of all the humanized BAT-1 antibody Vk<br>
region variants proposed above is given in FIG. 5.<br>
Although potential N-linked glycosylation sites i.e. Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)-Xaa (Gavel et al.,<br>
Protein Eng. 3:43, 1990) were searched for in both the donor mouse and acceptor human Vk<br>
regions, as well as the humanized constructs themselves, none were identified.<br>
Example 4<br>
Design of the humanized BAT-1 \'h antibody variants<br>
Again, the first step in the design of the humanized Vh region of the mouse BAT-1<br>
antibody was the selection of the acceptor human heavy chain variable region that would serve<br>
as the basis of the humanized BAT-1 VH region. When the mBAT-1 VH region was initially<br>
compared to the consensus sequences of the three human heavy chain variable region subgroups<br>
it was found to be most similar to the consensus sequence for human heavy chain subgroup I<br>
with a 61.54% identity overall and a 67.82% identity between the FRs alone. When measured<br>
with respect to similarity, these values also increased to 70.09% overall and 77.01% within the<br>
FRs alone.<br>
The mouse BAT-1 Vh region was then compared to all the recorded examples of<br>
individual sequences of human variable regions publicly available. Tables 6 and 7 show the best<br>
fifteen matches to the mouse BAT-1 VH region which were identified through this analysis.<br>
Overall, the search algorithm selected the human Vh region from antibody hsighvl295 (Fang et<br>
al., J. Exp. Med. 179:1445, 1994) as the closest match to the mouse BAT-1 VH region. This<br>
human VH region had an overall identity to the BAT-1 VH region of 69.23% (Table 7), a value<br>
which increased to 74.71% when the FRs alone were compared. When measured with respect to<br>
similarity, these values increased to 75.21% overall and 79.31% within the FRs alone. This<br>
human FR thus became the basis of the humanized version of the BAT-1 heavy chain.<br>
ID - percentage identity of the human Vh sequences to the murine BAT Vh region 2All -<br>
number of identical residues in the whole of the human Vh region when compared to the<br>
whole of the murine BAT Vh region<br>
3Surface (FR Surface) - number of identical (FR) residues on the surface<br>
5 4Core (FR Core) - number of identical residues within the (FR) core of the Fv domain<br>

6FR Near CDR - represents the number of identical residues amongst the FR amino acids<br>
within 5A of a CDR;<br>

10 ibid);<br>
8Vh (J Chain) - number of identical residues within the Vh (J Chain) gene<br>

10L1 to L3 Class - Canonical class of the CDR according to Martin &amp; Thornton (Martin et al.,<br>
ibid)<br>
15<br>
The next step in the design process was to study the amino acid sequences of the human<br>
acceptor hsighvl295 Vh region FRs to determine if any of these amino acid residues were likely<br>
to adversely influence binding to antigen. Once again, the molecular models built by OML (see<br>
Example 5) were crucial to this design process, from which a number of amino acids in the<br>
marine BAT-1 Vh region FRs were identified for conservation in the first (BATRHa) and<br>
subsequent versions of the humanized BAT-1 antibody (Table S). There were 22 amino acid<br>
differences between the FRs of the donor mouse BAT-1 and the acceptor human hsighvl295 Vh<br>
regions and up to nine murine residues were considered for conservation in the humanized FRs.<br>
BATRHa therefore consisted of the CDRs of the mouse BAT-1 antibody VH region<br>
genetically inserted into the FRs of the human hsighvl295 antibody VH region. This was the<br>
CDR-grafted version of the Vh region of the humanized BAT-1 antibody and contained no FR<br>
amino acid changes whatsoever.<br>
In BATRHb, the amino acids at positions 28 and 30 in FR1 of the mouse BAT-1 sequence<br>
(i.e. Thr and Thr, respectively) replaced the corresponding human hsighv 1295 amino acids (i.e.<br>
Ser, and Ser, respectively) in the humanized BAT-1 heavy chain variable region. This was done<br>
because they represented some of the canonical residues important for the HI hypervariable<br>
loop conformation (Chotbia et al, 1992 ibid). Canonical residues were considered critical for<br>
the correct orientation and structure of hypervariable loops and were generally always conserved<br>
in a humanized variable region. Moreover, residue positions 27-30 were considered part of the<br>
HI loop itself and so were even more critical to the correct conformation and orientation of this<br>
loop - justifying their conservation even more strongly. Thus, these two residue positions<br>
represented the sum of the changes made to the FRs of the human hsighvl295 sequence in<br>
BATRHb.<br>
The next step in the design process was to study the amino acid sequences of the human<br>
acceptor hsighvl295 Vh region FRs to determine if any of these amino acid residues were likely<br>
to adversely influence binding to antigen. Once again, the molecular models built by OML (see<br>
Example 5) were crucial to this design process, from which a number of amino acids in the<br>
murine BAT-1 Vh region FRs were identified for conservation in the first (BATRHA) and<br>
subsequent versions of the humanized BAT-1 antibody (Table 8). There were 22 amino acid<br>
differences between the FRs of the donor mouse BAT-1 and the acceptor human hsighvl295 Vh<br>
regions and up to nine murine residues were considered for conservation in the humanized FRs.<br>
BATRHa therefore consisted of the CDRs of the mouse BAT-1 antibody Vh region<br>
genetically inserted into the FRs of the human hsighvl295 antibody VH region. This was the<br>
CDR-grafted version of the VH region of the humanized BAT-1 antibody and contained no FR<br>
amino acid changes whatsoever.<br>
In BATRHb, the amino acids at positions 28 and 30 in FR1 of the mouse BAT-1 sequence<br>
(i.e. Thr and Thr, respectively) replaced the corresponding human hsighvl295 amino acids (i.e.<br>
Ser, and Ser, respectively) in the humanized BAT-1 heavy chain variable region. This was done<br>
because they represented some of the canonical residues important for the HI hypervariable<br>
loop conformation (Chothia et al., 1992 ibid). Canonical residues were: considered critical for<br>
the correct orientation and structure of hypervariable loops and were generally always conserved<br>
in a humanized variable region. Moreover, residue positions 27-30 were considered part of the<br>
H1 loop itself and so were even more critical to the correct conformation and orientation of this<br>
loop - justifying their conservation even more strongly. Thus, these two residue positions<br>
represented the sum of the changes made to the FRs of the human hsighv 1295 sequence in<br>
BATRHB.<br>
The third version of the humanized BAT-1 Vh region (BATRHc) incorporated all the<br>
substitutions made in BATRHb. and, in addition, contained a further three muiine amino acids,<br>
which were inserted into the human FRs in place of the corresponding human residues. The first<br>
of these was the Asn amino acid located at position 76 in FR3. According to the molecular<br>
model of the BAT-1 Fv region, the Asn residue was close to CDR H1 and may have been<br>
supporting the loop structure. In addition, in the mouse BAT-1 VH region, the Asn was surface<br>
exposed and larger than the Ser in the human hsighvl295 FRs. Consequently, a Ser76Asn<br>
substitution was made to the FR.<br>
A further change was made to the amino acid at position 94 in FR3 of the VH region, a<br>
residue position which had been previously identified by Chothia et al. (Chothia et al., 1992<br>
ibid) as well as by Martin and Thornton (Martin et al.., ibid), as .important for H3 loop<br>
conformation. Moreover, the molecular model indicated that: the Arg94 could form a salt bridge<br>
with AsplOl in CDR H3, stabilizing the loop structure. Consequently, the Arg in the mouse<br>
replaced the Lys in the human at this residue position. A final modification was also made at<br>
position 93 in FR3 where the human Ala was replaced by the murine Val amino acid. This<br>
residue was considered a packing residue, as defined by Chothia (Chothia et al., 19S5 ibid),<br>
important for the correct packing of the Vk and Vh regions. In addition, this was identified as a<br>
Vender residue position, and therefore important for maintaining CDR loop conformation, a<br>
classification confirmed by an analysis of the molecular model. Taken together, all the data and<br>
molecular analysis suggested that it was appropriate to conserve these three murine residues in<br>
the humanized VH region of BATRHC, i.e. Ser76Asn, Ala93Val and Lys94Arg.<br>
The construction of the next two humanized variants of the BAT-1 VH region depended<br>
upon the binding affinity of these first three humanized versions i.e. BATRHa, BATRHb and<br>
BATRHC. If all three failed to display an adequate level of binding, then versions BATRHd and<br>
BATRHe would be synthesized and tested.<br>
Version D of the humanized BAT-1 VH region (BATRHD) incorporated all the<br>
substitutions made in BATRHe and, in addition, contained one further mouse amino acid<br>
located at position 2 in FR1. This location was denned as both a canonical (Martin et al, ibid)<br>
and Vernier (Foote et al., ibid) residue position. In addition, from the model of the BAT-1<br>
variable region, the murine Ile amino acid was close to Tyr27 in FR1, which is itself part of the<br>
HI loop structure. Conversely, the murine Ile and human Val amino acids, at this location in the<br>
mouse and human FRs, were similar in character and only slightly different in size, i.e. Ile has<br>
an extra methyl group. Therefore, it was decided to make the Val2Ile change only at this stage<br>
of the humanization procedure and incorporate the mutation into version BATRHd-<br>
The final version of the humanized BAT-1 heavy chain variable region (BATRHE)<br>
incorporated all the mouse FR substitutions made in BATRHd along with three additional amino<br>
acid changes at positions 38 (FR2), 46 (FR2) and 68 (FR3).<br>
The Arg38Lys modification was made because the model suggested that the Arg, deeply<br>
buried in the core of the Vh region, was close to Phe63 in CDR H2. However, this was not a<br>
previously identified canonical or Vernier residue position. In addition, Arg and Lys are<br>
relatively similar in structure, although Arg is builder, and so the significance of any amino acid<br>
change was hard to judge. Consequently, this was considered as only a tentative possibility and<br>
the substitution was only going to be made if the binding affinity of the humanized BAT-1<br>
antibody was found to be poor. The same rationale was also behind the selection of the<br>
Ghi46Lys modification. The Lys amino acid was half-buried, according to the molecular model,<br>
but close to Glu62 and Phe63 in CDR H2. There was a faint possibility that the larger, charges<br>
Lys46 residue could interact with the antigen directly, therefore it was conserved in BATRHe.<br>
The case for preserving the murine 68Ala amino acid was related to its proximity to CDR H2,<br>
particularly to residue Tyr59 in the H2 loop, and to the chance of it therefore influencing loop<br>
structure. The Ala was unlikely to be important due to its small size, however the larger Val,<br>
found in the human hsighvl295 FRs could have adversely affected H2 loop structure, and so<br>
was replaced with the murine Ala residue.<br>
A description of the amino acid sequences of all the humanized Vh region variants<br>
proposed above is given in FIG. 6.<br>
Although potential N-linked glycosylation sites i.e. Asn-Xaa-(Sex/Thr)-Xaa (Gavel et al.,<br>
ibid) were searched for in both the donor mouse and acceptor human VH regions, as well as the<br>
humanized constructs themselves, none were identified.<br>
Example 5<br>
Molecular modeling of the murine and humanized BAT-1 Fv domain<br>
To assist the design of the humanized variable regions of the BAT-1 antibody, a molecular<br>
model of the variable regions of both the murine and the humanized antibodies were built. The<br>
modeling of these structures was achieved using both the established methods of modeling by<br>
homology and ab initio techniques. This was done using AbM molecular modeling package,<br>
which was supplied and utilized by Oxfored Molecular Limited (OML). Antibody X-ray<br>
crystallographic structures from the Brookhaven database available were formatted to allow<br>
them to be used for modeling with AbM.<br>
The FRs of the BAT-1 variable regions were modeled on FRs from similar, structurally<br>
solved immunoglobulin. variable regions. While identical amino acid side-chains were kept in<br>
their original orientation, mismatched side-chains were substituted as in the original BAT-1 Fv<br>
region. The backbone atoms of the FAB17-IA Vk region were used for the model of the BAT-1<br>
Vk region, while the FRs of the 409.5.3 Vh region were used to model the BAT-1 Vh region<br>
(Brookhaven PDB codes lfor and liai, respectively). These sequences both represented good<br>
matches for the variable region sequences of murine BAT-1 antibody, and their humanized<br>
variants. The identities for the mBAT-1 and humanized sequences ranged from 73% to 92% for<br>
Vk region sequences and between 65% and 79% for VH region sequences. Testing of AbM with<br>
known structures has shown that FR backbone homology is an important factor in the quality of<br>
any model, since the use of FR structures that poorly match a sequence being modeled can<br>
significantly and adversely affect the position and orientation of the CDR loop structure.<br>
For the backbone structure of the L1 loop, the loop conformations of the murine BAT-1<br>
Vk region and the humanized BATRkb sequence (FIG. 5) were taken from canonical classes<br>
used by AbM. These canonical classes are based on those described by Chothia and his<br>
colleagues, but they have been modified to take into consideration structures that have become<br>
available since the original articles were published (Chothia et al., 1987, 1989, 1992 ibid;<br>
Tramontano et al., ibid). Testing the performance of AbM predictions for known loop structures<br>
has shown that CDR loops which are created in this way are usually modeled very accurately,<br>
i.e. to within 1-1.5A RMS deviation. For the Vk region sequence BATRka, the substitution of<br>
Phe for Tyr at position 71 (in FR3) meant that it no longer fitted the canonical class (Class 1)<br>
seen in the murine Vk region and the humanized BATRkb Vk region. Tyr71 had an important<br>
role in the conformation of the L1 loop, however, analysis of the modeled structures suggested<br>
that it was the packing of the L1 loop against the aromatic ring of Tyr which was the key feature<br>
of the residue. Thus, there was reason to believe that Phe could also perform this function. In<br>
addition, from the models there did not seem to be any strong interactions with the hydroxyl<br>
group of Tyr71. Consequently, there was a possibility that the substitution of Tyr with Phe<br>
could well have had no affect the actual conformation of the L1 loop.<br>
For the backbone structures of CDRs L2, L3, H1 and H2, conformations for all the models<br>
were taken from canonical classes defined by AbM without modification.<br>
The H3 loop in the BAT-1 VH region was eight residues long, so two methods were used<br>
for predicting the H3 loop structure. A database search for the backbone conformations was<br>
used for both methods, but in addition, the conformation of the central five residues in the model<br>
were searched more thoroughly using a CONGEN search (Bruccoleri, Ibid). Although this took<br>
longer to compute, it reassuringly produced a conformation which was very similar to those<br>
identified from the database search.<br>
After adjusting the whole of the model for obvious steric clashes it was finally subjected to<br>
energy minirmzation, as implemented in MACROMODEL, both to relieve unfavorable atomic<br>
contacts and to optimize van der Waals and electrostatic interactions.<br>
Example 6<br>
Construction of humanized BAT-1 light chain variants<br>
As with all examples, a strict PCR-cloning and sequencing protocol was followed. This<br>
was done to minimize the possibility of introducing errors into the humanized versions. The<br>
construction of the humanized BAT-1 kappa light chain variable region genes (i.e. BATRka,<br>
BATRkb, and BATRkd) produced an approximately 425 bp product which was then subcloned<br>
in pCR2.1™. The PCR reactions were set up using the primers described in Tables 9 and 10.<br>
Putative positive transformants were identified using tie PCR-screening assay, restriction<br>
digest and then ds-DNA sequenced. The humanized Vk genes (FIGS. 7-9; SEQ ID NOS. 15,16 and<br>
18) were then sub cloned into expression plasmids.<br>
The light chain pKN110 construct included Ampicillin and Neomycin resistance genes.<br>
The humanized Vk gene variants of BAT-1 (i.e. BATRka, BATRkb and BATRkd) were<br>
inserted between the HCMV Immediate Early Promoter and the genomic human kappa constant<br>
region resulting in the following expression vectors: pKN110-BATRka, pKN110-BATRKB and<br>
pKN110-BATRkd, respectively (see FIG. 10 for a representative pKN110-BATRKD vector).<br>
The BAT-1 light chain expression cassette inserted into an expression vector included a<br>
DNA fragment encoding a mouse immunoglobulin signal peptide sequence, Kozak sequence<br>
and a signal sequence nitron which was added to both sides of the humanized Vk gene variants<br>
of BAT-1 (FIG. 11). This cassette was inserted between the HCMV Immediate Early Promoter<br>
and the genomio human kappa constant region. The complete light chain expression vector also<br>
included a BGH polyA transcription terminator and a Neo/G418 selection marker. All constructs<br>
were restriction enzyme digested and ds-DNA sequenced to confirm the presence of the correct<br>
insert.<br>
Example 7<br>
Construction of humanized BAT-! heavy chain variants<br>
The construction of the various versions of the reshaped human BAT-1 heavy chain<br>
variable region genes (i.e. BATRHA, BATRHb, BATRH'c) produced an approximately 450 bp<br>
product which was then subcloned into pCR2.1™. The PCR reactions were set up using the<br>
primers described in Tables 11 and 12.<br>
Putative positive transformants were again identified in a PCR. screen and then ds-DNA<br>
sequenced. The humanized Vh genes (SEQ ID NOS. 20 - 22) were then subcloned<br>
into expression vectors.<br>
The heavy chain pG1D110 construct included Ampicillin resistance gene and the hamster<br>
dhfr as the selectable marker. The humanized Vh gene variants of BAT-1 were inserted between<br>
the HCMV Immediate Early Promoter and the genomic human IgG1 constant region resulting in<br>
the following expression vectors: pG1D110-BATRHA, pGlD110-BATRHB, pGlDHO-<br>
BATRHc (see FIG. 15 for a representative pGlD110.BAT-l.RHG vector).<br>
The BAT-1 heavy chain expression cassette inserted into an expression vector which<br>
included a DNA fragment encoding a mouse itnmunoglolbulin signal peptide sequence, Kozak<br>
sequence and a signal sequence intron which was added to both sides of the humanized Vk gene<br>
variants of BAT-1 (FIG. 16). This cassette was inserted between the HCMV Immediate Early<br>
Promoter and the genomic human IgG1 constant region. The complete light chain expression<br>
vector also included a BGH polyA transcription terminator and a dhfr selection marker.<br>
The resulting expression vectors were restriction enzyme digested to confirm the presence<br>
of the correct insert.<br>
Example 8<br>
Construction of BAT-1 RHc/Rkd ?1 complete antibody in a single expression vector<br>
in order to maximize the achievable expression levels for the BAT-1 yl antibody it was<br>
decided to remove an intron from the pGlD110.BAT-1.RHc construct (described in Example 7,<br>
see FIG. 15) before making the BAT-1 yl single vector construct. This procedure was carried<br>
out as follows.<br>
pGlD200 is another yl immunoglobulin heavy chain mammalian expression vector<br>
(AERES Biomedical; FIG. 17). This vector is a VH:CH ?1 intron minus version of the pG1D110<br>
vector (i.e. it does not have the 71bp intron at the VH:CH junction).<br>
In order to convert the pG1D110.BAT-l.RHc construct into a construct, a BstER fragment<br>
(219bp) was excised from the pGlD200 vector and gel purified using a Qiagen gel<br>
extraction/purification kit. This fragment contained the intron minus Vh:Ch junction.<br>
The pGlD110.BAT-l.RHc construct (FIG. 15) was also restriction digested with BstER,<br>
releasing a 290bp fragment which contained the intron plus VH:CH junction. The remaining<br>
vector fragment (~7207bp) was gel purified using a Qiagen gel extraction/ purification kit.<br>
The intron minus BstEII fragment (219bp) from the pGlD200 vector digest was then<br>
ligated into the ~7207bp BstER digested pGlD110.BAT-l.RHc vector. 2µ1 of ligated DNA was<br>
transformed into DH5a cells (Stratagene) according to the manufacturers instructions. Plasmid<br>
DNA was prepared from 10 colonies and each, plasmid DNA was analyzed for the presence of<br>
the correct BstBII fragment by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Following identification of a perfect clone, the new nitron minus construct<br>
(pGlD210.BAT-l.RHc) and the light chain construct pKN110.BAT.RkD (see FIG. 10) were<br>
used to construct the pG1KD210.BAT-1.RHc/RKD single expression vector (SEQ ID NO. 93).<br>
The component of this pG1KD210.BAT-1RHc/RKD single expression vector within SEQ<br>
ID NO 93 are localized as follows:<br>
1. Nucleotide range: 1 to 2502 - pBE322 (pBR322 based sequence including the Amp-<br>
resistance gene and Co1E1 origin plus the SV40 origin and crippled SV40 early<br>
promoter)<br>
2. Nucleotide range: 206 to 1067 - Amp (Ampicillin resistance gene)<br>
3. Position: 1824-Co1E1<br>
4. Nucleotide range: 2502 to 3227 - DHFR (Dihydrofolate reductase gene)<br>
5. Nucleotide range: 3233 to 4074 - SV40 polyA (SV40 poly A sequence etc)<br>
6. Nucleotide range: 4109 to 5649 - HCMVi (HCMVi promoter)<br>
7. Nucleotide range: 5662 to 6067- BAT rKd<br>
Reshaped BAT lcappa light chain variable region.<br>
8. Nucleotide range: 6073 to 6720 - HuK (cDNA copy of human kappa constant region<br>
(Krn(3)) gene)<br>
9. Nucleotide range: 6726 to 6943 - spaC2 Artificial spaC2 termination sequence<br>
10. Nucleotide range: 6949 to 8489- HCMVi (HCMVi promoter )<br>
11.12. Nucleotide range: 8502 to 8923 - BAT rHc<br>
Reshaped BAT heavy chain variable region<br>
13. Nucleotide range : 8924 to 10297 - HG1 (Human gamma-1 constant regions<br>
preceded by a 60bp natron and followed by the 'Amie' termination sequence)<br>
The BAT-1 kappa light chain expression cassette which contained the HCMVi promoter, the<br>
BAT-1 kappa light chain variable region gene, and the kappa light chain constant region gene,<br>
was restriction enzyme digested (EcdBI /SpeI) out of the pKN110.BAT-1.Rkd construct and<br>
subsequently ligated into the pGlD210.BAT-l.RHc construct via the unique EcoRI and SpeI<br>
restriction sites. This ligation resulted in the construction of the single expression vector<br>
pGlKD210.BAT-1.RHc/RKD, containing both the heavy and kappa light chains of the BAT-1<br>
humanized antibody RHc/Rkd (FIG. 18). 2µ1 of ligated DNA was transformed into DH5a cells<br>
(Stratagene) according to the manufacturers instructions. Mini prep DNA. was prepared from ten<br>
colonies and each plasmid DNA was analyzed for the presence of the correct single expression<br>
construct by restriction digesi analysis. One clone of a correct single expression construct was<br>
chosen for the transient expression of the BAT-1 gamma-1 antibody in COS cells as will be<br>
illustrated in Example 11.<br>
Example 9<br>
Construction of the BAT-1.BHc/Rkd gamma-1 (?1) complete antibody variant in a single<br>
expression vector<br>
The BATRHc heavy chain variable region was transferred to the combined (single)<br>
expression vector as an Xhol to Hind111 fragment. The BATRkd light chain variable region<br>
was transferred to the combined (single) expression vector as ssiXbal to BamBI fragment. The<br>
internal Xbal site in the light chain gene was removed without changing the amino acid<br>
sequence. The sequences of the BAT-1.RKr/BAT-1.RHc heavy and light chain variable regions<br>
in this vector were confirmed. The vector includes genomic human IgG1 and Kappa constant<br>
regions. Both heavy and light chain genes were placed under the control of the HCMV<br>
Immediate Early promoter. The vector includes a mouse dhfr gene as the selectable marker (see<br>
FIG. 19). The same Kozak sequence, signal peptide sequence and intion were added as for the<br>
two vector expression system (see Examples 6 and 7).<br>
Example 10<br>
Construction of the BAT-1 gamma-4 (?4) PG4KD110.BAT-1. RHc/RKd in a single vector<br>
The first step in the construction of the BAT-1 yA single expression vector construct was<br>
the cloning of the modified BAT-1.RHC gene out of the pGlD110.BA.T-1.RHc construct (FIG.<br>
14) by BamHI and HindIII restriction digest, and ligation of tins 430bp fragment into the<br>
gamma-4 immunoglobulin heavy chain expression vector pG4D110, again via BamHI and<br>
HindIII. restriction sites.<br>
2µl of ligated DNA was transformed into DH5a cells (Stratagene) according to the<br>
manufacturers instructions. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 10 colonies and each plasmid<br>
DNA was analyzed for the presence of the correct BAT-1.RHC BamHI/HindIII fragment by<br>
DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Following identification of a perfect clone, the new gamma-4 construct (pG4D110.BAT-<br>
1.RHc) and the light chain construct pKN110.BAT-1.RKD (FIG. 10) were used to construct the<br>
pG4KD110.BAT-1 ,HRc/Rkd single expression vector in the following way.<br>
The BAT-1 kappa light chain expression cassette which contained the HCMVi promoter,<br>
the BAT-1 kappa light chain variable region gene, and the kappa light chain constant region<br>
gene, was restriction enzyme digested (EcoRI/SpeI) out of the pKN110.BAT-1.Rkd construct<br>
and subsequently ligated into pG4D110.BAT-l.RHc construct via the unique EcoRI and SpeI<br>
restriction sites. This ligation resulted in the construction of a single expression vector construct<br>
pG4KD110.BAT-1.RHc/Rkd, containing both the heavy and kappa light chains of the BAT-1<br>
humanized antibody RHc/Rkd variant. 2µl of ligated DNA was transformed into DH5a cells<br>
(Stratagene) according to the manufacturers instructions. Mini prep DNA was prepared from ten<br>
colonies and each plasmid DNA was analyzed for the presence of the correct single expression<br>
vector construct by restriction digest analysis. The correct single expression vector construct<br>
digested with BamHI and with HindIII released a 2864bp fragment and the HindIII digest<br>
released a 2840bp fragment. One clone was chosen for the transient expression of the BAT-1<br>
gamma-4 antibody in COS cells.<br>
Example 11<br>
Co-transfection of humanized BAT-1 light and heavy chain vectors, and transient<br>
expression of the humanized BAT-1 variants in COS7 cells<br>
The humanized BAT-1 heavy (pGlDllO) and light (pKNUO; Example 7) chain<br>
expression vectors were co-transfected, at various combinations, into COS7 cells and after 72 hr<br>
incubation, the medium was collected, spun to remove cell debris, filtered and analyzed by<br>
ELISA for humanized antibody production. The concentration of humanized antibody in the<br>
COS7 cell supematants varied with each combination of reshaped human BAT-1 antibody<br>
constructs that were tested (Table 13). For example, version BATRHb/BATRka expressed the<br>
highest antibody levels (4800 ng/ml) whilst the BATRHb/BATRkd version was the poorest<br>
expresser (357 ng/ml).<br>
Example 12<br>
Purification of the humanized BAT-1 variants from COS7 cells<br>
Harvesting approximately 8 ml per co-transfection (see Example 11), a series of<br>
transfections were carried out until in excess of 200 ml of COS7 supernatant had been collected.<br>
The volume of this supernatant was reduced to 10 ml by passing the supernatant through a<br>
stirred ultra-filtration cell with a PM30 filter membrane - which had a molecular weight cut-off<br>
of 30 kDa.<br>
The Immunopure©(A) IgG purification kit essentially comprised of a 2 ml column of<br>
immobilized Protein A Sepharose column. The antibody was eluted from the column with 5 ml<br>
of elution buffer, the eluate of which was collected in 1 ml fractions. The concentration of<br>
0humanized BAT-1 antibody in each fraction was then assayed using ELISA methods. Table 13<br>
describes the final concentrations of the Protein A purified antibody constructs collected. On<br>
average the purification step increased the antibody concentration by approximately 150-fold.<br>
Example 13<br>
Analysis of Daudi cell binding to the humanized BAT-1 variants produced in COS7<br>
cells<br>
Using the Daudi cell ELISA iit was clear that the different versions of the Protein A<br>
purified humanized BAT-1 antibody bound to Daudi cells to various degrees. FIGS. 20-23 show<br>
typical examples for these binding experiments. Sigmoidal dose-response curves of Daudi cell<br>
binding by the recombinant antibodies were also plotted and the hill slopes of these binding<br>
curves were calculated. The combination of the hill slope data and the positions of the dose-<br>
response curves relative to the chimeric antibody dose-response curves suggested a qualitative<br>
hierarchy with respect to Daudi cell binding among the various humanized BAT-1 antibody<br>
constructs tested (Table 14). At the top of this hierarchy was clearly construct<br>
BATRHc/BATRkd, which exhibited a hill slope (i.e. 0.8818 ± 0.1107) very similar to its<br>
chirneric BAT-1 antibody control (i.e. 0.8248 ± 0.1210) and closely tracked the dose-response<br>
curve of the chimeric control. Although construct BATBHc/BATRkb displayed a steeper hill<br>
slope (i.e. 0.6408 ± 0.1622) than the same chimeric BAT-1 antibody control (i.e. 0.8248 ±<br>
0.1210), as calculated from the available binding data, the difference was no statistically<br>
significant, hi addition, it is clear from FIG. 22 that the dose-response curve for this construct is<br>
not as good as for the BATRHc/BATRkd construct and was therefore ranked second in the<br>
binding hierarchy.<br>
Conversely, construct BATRHa/BATRka clearly has the poorest binding characteristics of<br>
all the humanized BAT-1 antibody constructs tested (Table 14) and so was ranked sixth in the<br>
binding hierarchy. Although the calculated hill slope for this version (i.e. 1.2730 ± 0.2688) is<br>
apparently better than the very similar humanized construct BATRHb/BATRka (i.e. 1.7710 ±<br>
0.6461) this difference is again not statistically significant. In addition, it is clear from FIG. 21<br>
that the CDR-grafted BATRHa/BATRka BAT-1 antibody is reaching its maximum binding<br>
response at much lower level than the humanized construct BATRHb/BATRka - which was<br>
ranked fifth in the binding hierarchy.<br>
Constructs BATRHb/BATRkb (FIG. 20; ranked fourth) and BATRHb/BATRkd (FIG. 23;<br>
ranked third) display intermediate levels of binding between these two sets of extremes. Again<br>
these rankings were mainly based upon a subjective interpretation of the binding data available<br>
and previous experience.<br>
Example 14<br>
Transient expression of the BAT-1 Rkd/RHc variant by co-transfection or by single<br>
transfection of COS cells<br>
The method of Kettleborough (Kettleborough et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 23:206, 1993) was<br>
followed to transfect the mammalian expression constructs into COS cells. Briefly, the DNA<br>
(10µg each of the kappa light chain expression construct pKN110.BAT-1.Rkd and the heavy<br>
chain expression construct pGlD210.BAT-l.RHc, or 13µg of the single vector construct<br>
pG1KD210.BAT-1.RHc/Rkd) was added to a 0.7 ml aliquot of 107 cells/ml in PBS and pulsed<br>
at 1900 V, 25 µF capacitance using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus. Following a 10 minute<br>
recovery at room temperature, the electroporated cells were transferred to petri-dislies<br>
containing 8 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS and incubated for 72 hrs in 5%CO2 at 37°C.<br>
After 72 hrs incubation, the medium was collected, spun to remove cell debris, and analyzed by<br>
capture ELISA for antibody production. The co-transfections, with light chain expression<br>
vector and heavy chain expression vector, and transfections with a single-vector expressing both<br>
light and heavy chains, were carried out in triplicate. The results are presented in Table 15. The<br>
results indicate that expression levels from the single vector are ~6 fold higher than the<br>
expression levels observed for the co-transfections.<br>
Example 15<br>
Stable transfection of CHOdhfr- mammalian cells with the single vector pGlKD210.BAT-<br>
1.RHc/Rkd and production of stable cell lines<br>
CHOdhfr- cells were propagated in a non-selective media consisting of a-MEM with<br>
ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone II and 50µg/ml<br>
Gentamicin. Aliquot, 0.7 ml, of 107 cells/ml in PBS was transfected with Bug of<br>
pGlKD210.BAT-l.RHc/RKD at 1900 V, 25 µF capacitance using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The<br>
cells were allowed to recover for 10 minutes at RT before being transferred to 10 cm petri-<br>
dishes in 8 ml of non-selective media and then incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 48 hours.<br>
Two days after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, spun down and resuspended in 150<br>
ml of prewarmed selective media (a-MEM without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides,<br>
supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 50µg/ml Gentamicin, and containing either lOnM,<br>
50nM, 100nM or 500nM Methotrxate) before being divided equally between fifteen 10cm petri-<br>
dishes. These were then incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 20-30 days, the selective media being<br>
changed every 3-4 days until foci were clearly visible. After 2 weeks from the initial<br>
transfection, foci began to develop on the 10nM plates. Eight days later, one focus developed<br>
on the 50nM plates. No other foci developed after 35 days, on the 50nM plates and no foci<br>
developed on the 100nM or 500nM plates.<br>
To "pick" foci, 1mm squares of Whatman 1MM filter paper were first immersed in 0.05%<br>
trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solution. The selective media was carefully removed from the culture<br>
dishes, which were then washed carefully with 5 ml of PBS. The PBS was then removed and,<br>
using sterile forceps, the squares of pre-soaked filter paper were carefully placed onto individual<br>
focus of cells. The squares were left on the foci for 15 seconds before being transferred into<br>
individual wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 1 ml of the appropriate selective<br>
media.<br>
A total of 31 gamma-1 foci were picked, 30 were from the 10nM MTX plates and one was<br>
from the 50nM plates. These cells were allowed to grow in selective media until almost<br>
confluent and the media from individual wells was tested for antibody production. Those clones<br>
producing human antibody were then selected for expansion and specific production analysis.<br>
The results of the specific production assays are presented in Table 16.<br>
The three cell lines (B9, B13 and B15) which showed the best specific productivity levels<br>
were further analyzed and monitored for accurate doubling times, (see Table 17).<br>
Based on specific productivity levels and doubling times it was decided to begin<br>
production of the 500µg quantity of the BAT-1 ?1 antibody using the B15 cell line.<br>
Example 16<br>
Transient expression of BAT-1 ?4 RHc/Rkd variant in COS cells by single- and co-<br>
transfections<br>
The method of Kettleborough et al. was followed to transfect the mammalian expression<br>
constructs into COS cells. Briefly, the DNA (10µg each of the kappa light chain expression<br>
construct pKN110.BAT-1.Rkd and the heavy chain expression construct pG4Dl 10.BAT-1.RHc,<br>
or 13ug of the supervector construct pG4D110.BAT-1.RHc/RKD) was added to a 0.7 ml aliquot<br>
of 107 cells/ml in PBS and pulsed at 1900 V, 25 µF capacitance using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser<br>
apparatus. Following a 10 minute recovery at RT, the electroporated cells were transferred to<br>
petri-dishes containing 8 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS and incubated for 72 hrs in 5%CO2<br>
at 37°C. After 72 hrs incubation, the medium was collected, spun to remove cell debris, and<br>
analyzed by capture ELISA for antibody production.<br>
Both the co-transfections and single transfections were carried out in triplicate. The<br>
results are presented in Table 18. The results indicate that expression levels from this single<br>
expression vector are ~4 fold higher than the expression levels observed for the co-transfections.<br>
Example 17<br>
Stable transfection of CROdhfr- mammalian cells with the single vector pG4KD210.BAT-<br>
1.RHc/Rkd and production of stable cell lines<br>
CHOdhfr- cells were propagated in a non-selective media consisting of a-MEM with<br>
ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone II and 50ug/ml<br>
Gentamicin. Aliquot, 0.7 ml, of 107 cells/ml in PBS was transfected with 13u.g of<br>
pG4KD110.BAT-1.RHc/RKD at 1900 V, 25 µF capacitance using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The<br>
cells were allowed to recover for 10 minutes at room temperature before being transferred to<br>
10cm petri-dishes in 8 ml of non-selective media and then incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 48<br>
hours. Two days following this incubation, the cells were trypsinized, spun down and<br>
resuspended in 150 ml of prewarmed selective media (a-MEM without ribonucleosides and<br>
deoxyribonucleosides, supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 50ug/ml Gentamicin, and<br>
containing either 10nM, 50nM, 100nM or 500nM Methotrexate) before being divided equally<br>
between fifteen 10cm petri-dishes. These were then incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C for 20-30<br>
days, the selective media being changed every 3-4 days until foci were clearly visible.<br>
After 2 weeks, foci began to develop on the 10nM plates. No foci developed after 35 days<br>
on the 50nM plates and on the 100nM or 500nM plates. Foci were picked as described earlier<br>
(Example 15) and those selected clones producing human antibody were then selected for<br>
expansion and specific production analysis. The results of the specific production assays are<br>
presented in Table 19.<br>
Example 18<br>
Co-transfection of NSO cells with BATHC heavy chain and BATkd light chain<br>
amplification vectors and selection of antibody producing cell lines<br>
Expression vectors containing the BATRHc heavy chain cassette (FIG. 16) and the<br>
BATRkd light chain cassettes (FIG.11) were mixed and transfected into the NSO host cell line<br>
by electroporation.<br>
Transfected cells were distributed into 10 96-well plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles<br>
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1 mg/ml G418<br>
(Gentamicin) medium. After 10 to 14 days when colonies of transfected cells have developed,<br>
samples of conditioned medium from the wells were assayed for humanized BAT-1 antibody.<br>
Cells from the highest producing wells were picked, and expanded in medium including G418.<br>
The transfection was repeated after one week as a back up and to provide more transfected<br>
cell clones for selection. After 10 days visible colonies of transfected cells had developed, and<br>
conditioned medium from the wells was screened for antibody production. ELISA plates were<br>
coated with sheep anti-human k antibody. 25 µl samples of medium from the wells were<br>
transferred to the ELISA plate and diluted to 100µl in PBS Tween (PBST). The secondary<br>
antibody was HRP-conjugated sheep anti-human IgG (y chain specific) and color was developed<br>
with o-Phenylene Diamine (OPD). Positive wells were examined microscopically and the cells<br>
from the highest producing wells were picked into 1.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10%<br>
FBS and 1 mg/ml G418 in 24 well plates. A total of 15 high producing colonies were picked<br>
from the two transfections (Table 20). Two independent cell lines gave antibody production<br>
levels around 40µg/ml or greater.<br>
For amplification using the dhfr gene in the heavy chain vector, an initial two high<br>
producing cell lines have been transferred to medium (DMEM with 10% FCS and lmg/ml<br>
G418) with 0.02 uM Methotrexate added.<br>
Example 19<br>
Transfection of NSO host cell line with a single amplification vector containing BAT-<br>
I.RHc/Rkd ?1 gene and selection of antibody producing cell lines<br>
The combined (single) antibody expression vector described in Example 9, was transfected<br>
into the NSO host cell line by electroporation.<br>
Transfected cells were distributed into 10 96-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS. After<br>
2 days an equal amount of medium with 0.1µM Methotrexate was added. Half the medium was<br>
changed with the same volume of 0.1µM MTX-containing medium every 2 days until the 8th<br>
day post transfection. The transfection was repeated after one week as a back up and to provide<br>
more transfected cell clones for selection. After 14-21 days visible colonies of transfected cells<br>
had developed, and conditioned medium from the wells was screened for antibody production as<br>
described in the above Example. Positive wells were examined microscopically and the cells<br>
from the highest producing wells were picked into 1.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10%<br>
FBS and 0.1µM Methotrexate in 24 well plates. A total of 13 high producing colonies were<br>
picked from the two transfections and kept frozen in liquid nitrogen (Table 20). Six<br>
independent cell lines gave antibody production levels above 40µg/ml. Due to the different<br>
selection, the cell lines containing the single vector were slower to develop than those<br>
containing the antibody genes on 2 different vectors.<br>
A representative example of the humanized BAT producing cells after transfection of an<br>
NSO host cell line with a single amplification vector containing BAT-1.RHc/R.Kd ?1 gene and<br>
selection of antibody producing cell lines, i.e., cloned cell line 1B7, was deposited at the ATCC<br>
Cell Bank using the Budapest Treaty Deposit Form on May 9, 2003 under accession number<br>
ATCC#(PTA-5189).<br>
Example 20<br>
Inhibition of mouse BAT-1 by humanized BAT-1.RHc/Rkd ?1 variant<br>
To assure that the humanized BAT-1.RHc/Rkd ?1 variant can recognize the same epitope<br>
as the original murine BAT-1, a competition assay of binding to Daudi cells that express the<br>
BAT-1-binding epitope was conducted.<br>
Daudi cells were incubated with increasing amounts of the humanized BAT-1 or the mouse<br>
BAT-1 as control (0-80 µg/ml). Unbound antibody was discarded and biotinylated murine-BAT-<br>
1 (20 µg/ml) added to the cells and stained with streptavidin-FITC. Figure 24 depicts a decreased<br>
binding of murine BAT-1 in the presence of increasing concentrations of both the humanized<br>
and original mouse mAb, supporting the recognition of the same epitope as expected. Both<br>
antibodies show a similar dose dependency, with an IC50 of approximately 10 µg/ml, suggesting<br>
a similar affinity of antigen binding.<br>
Example 21<br>
In vivo effect of humanized BAT-1 in a murine tumor model<br>
As shown in Example 20, CDR grafting resulting in the formation of the humanized BAT-<br>
1.RHc/Rkd ?1 mAb retained recognition of BAT-1 antigen. To examine whether this binding<br>
can transmit the biological effects characteristic of murine BAT-1, the efficacy of the humanized<br>
BAT-1 was studied in vivo. This is of particular importance in view of the isotype difference<br>
between the mouse and human mAbs.<br>
C57BL mice were inoculated with B16 melanoma cells to induce lung metastases.<br>
Increasing amounts (1,10 and 20 µg) of humanized mAb were injected on day 12 post tumor-<br>
inoculation and compared to an optimal dose of 10µ.g murine-BAT-1. Lung weight measured on<br>
Day 24 post tumor inoculation is depicted in FIG. 25 and corresponds to the establishment of a<br>
tumor. Bom non-treated mice and mice treated with an isotype-inatched irrelevant human IgG1,<br>
had an average lung weight of 0.9 gr. The humanized BAT-1 exhibited a dose dependent<br>
inhibition of metastases growth with the highest inhibition occurring at a low dose of 1µg/mouse.<br>
This resulted in a decrease of 67% in tumor mass and was similar to that achieved by an optimal<br>
dose of murine BAT-1 (62%). Importantly, this maximal effect was achieved by a ten-fold lower<br>
dose of the humanized mAb, suggesting a higher therapeutic efficacy of this antibody in<br>
comparison to the original murine BAT-1 mAb.<br>
Example 22<br>
Inhibition of Human Melanoma (SK-28) in SCID Mice by hBAT-1<br>
Mouse-BAT-1 mAb has been shown to inhibit the formation of human-tumor metastases<br>
in the presence of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBL). To estimate the efficacy of<br>
humanized BAT-1.RHc/Rkd ?1 mAb in inhibition of human cancer, the humanized antibody<br>
was studied in a model combining both tumors and lymphocytes of human origin. Severe<br>
combined immune-deficient mice (SCID) were engrafted with hPBL to restore immune-<br>
competence. Mice were challenged with human melanoma cells (SK-28) and treated with<br>
increasing concentrations of the humanized antibody, administered in a single i.v. dose on day<br>
11 post tumor inoculation. Fig 26 depicts lung weight that correlates with the number of<br>
metastases observed, as measured on day 23. Both concentrations of the humanized antibody<br>
induced tumor inhibition in the presence of hPBL. As observed in the mouse tumor model<br>
described above, the humanized antibody could more efficiently inhibit: tumor growth in vivo,<br>
in comparison to mouse BAT-1. A single dose of 1µg of this humanized antibody inhibited<br>
tumor growth by 68% showing a higher efficacy than lOug of the mouse BAT-1 antibody<br>
(30%).<br>
Example 23<br>
Immunotherapy of human colorectal cancer hepatic metastases by hBAT-1<br>
monoclonal antibody in nude mice<br>
LBVI6 and HM7 are two sub-clones of the human CRC cell line LS174T that were selected<br>
for their high mucin synthesis and metastatic potential. The tumor cells were injected into the<br>
exposed spleen of anesthetized nude mice. After 1 minute, the spleens were removed and the<br>
excisions closed. Low doses of murine and humanized BAT-1 antibody were administered 12<br>
days later and mice were sacrificed 35 days post tumor inoculation. The livers were weighed,<br>
the number of metastatic nodules was counted, and liver tissue was processed for histology and<br>
Immimobistochemistry study.<br>
Treatment with BAT-1, murine and humanized antibodies, was found efficient in<br>
inhibition of liver metastases establishment in the murine model. Mouse BAT-1 antibody<br>
treatment prevented LIM-6 xenografts development. The average weight of xenografts from<br>
BAT-1 treated mice and controls were of 0.14±0.17gr and 0.98+1.12gr, respectively (P=0.004).<br>
HM7 cells injected to the nude mice resulted in large number of bulky metastatic lesions in the<br>
liver that were prevented by the single administration of murine BAT-1 and humanized BAT-1<br>
(Fig. 27). A major (over 40%) decrease was observed in the number of metastatic nodules,<br>
namely from 134.5+34 in the control mice to 8.36+3 and 4.88+2 in mice treated with murine<br>
BAT-1 humanized BAT-1, respectively. Treatment with BAT-1 prevented the accumulation of<br>
lymphocytes in the tumor edge. The role of lymphocyte infiltration around the metastatic<br>
nodule may be related to outcome of the cancer and may suggest a mechanism for BAT-1<br>
therapy.<br>
Example 24<br>
Co-localization of hBAT with CD4 and CD8<br>
Mouse BAT-1 has been shown to bind human lymphocytes, recognizing both CD4+ and<br>
CD8+ subsets. To establish the binding specificity of the humanized BATRHc/BATRkd yl<br>
mAb (hBAT), human Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated from the blood of<br>
normal donors, as described hereinbelow, and analyzed for co-localization of hBAT with known<br>
lymphocyte markers.<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by ficoll and incubated in tissue<br>
culture plates to remove adherent cells. Isolated PBL were gated on lymphocytes by size and<br>
granularity and on live cells by propidium iodine (PI) exclusion. Binding was performed at 4°C<br>
for 1 hr, and determined by flow cytometry on gated lymphocytes.<br>
In all samples examined at least 20% of PBL exhibited binding to hBAT. Figure 28<br>
depicts an example of binding to lymphocytes of a selected donor in which 50% of the isolated<br>
PBL were positive for hBAT, including both CD4+ cells (25%) and CD8+ cells (15%). Within<br>
these subpopulations, the majority of CD4+ as well as CD8+ cells bound the hBAT mAb (58%<br>
and 71% respectively).<br>
Example 25<br>
Binding of hBAT to B lymphocytes<br>
The humanized BATRHc/BATRkd yl mAb (hBAT) was raised against the membranes of<br>
Daudi cells, a human B lymphoma cell-line. PBL from normal donors were isolated by ficoll, as<br>
described above, followed by adherence to tissue culture plates. Non-adherent cells were<br>
examined for the co-localization of hBAT with B-cell markers including CD19 and CD20.<br>
Binding was performed at 4°C for 1 hr, and determined by flow cytometry on gated<br>
lymphocytes. Figure 29 depicts the evaluation of binding to the cells of a representative normal<br>
donor.<br>
25-29% of lymphocytes in the sample were positive for the humanized BAT mAb. These<br>
cells included the majority of B cells (70-75%) as demonstrated by both independent markers.<br>
70% of CD20+ were positive for the humanized BAT mAb (Gated on R1 and PI negative; Fig.<br>
29A) and 75% of CD19+ were positive for the humanized BAT mAb (Gated on R1 and PI<br>
negative). The results suggest that the BAT-binding moiety on the cell surface could be common<br>
to peripheral B cells.<br>
Example 26<br>
Binding of hBAT to CD4+ T cells increases upon activation of the cells<br>
Binding of the mouse BAT antibody has been formerly con-elated with lymphocyte<br>
activation. This binding activity was further studied for the human mAb and the binding level of<br>
the human BAT mAB to human CD4+ T cells, subjected to activation, was examined. Cells<br>
were isolated from a normal donor by negative selection and stimulated with beads conjugated<br>
to anti-CD3 and anti-CD2S (5j_il/ml). This treatment was selected in order to exert polyclonal<br>
activation through the T-cell receptor and co-stimulatory molecules.<br>
Cells were examined for binding of the humanized BATRHc/BATRkd yl mAb (hBAT)<br>
and anti-CD4 (4°C, 1 hr) on day 0, 2 and 5 following activation (Fig. 30A, B and D). Analysis<br>
was performed by flow cytometry on cells negative for PI staining. Quadrants were determined<br>
by isotype controls.<br>
The binding of the humanized BATRHc/BATRkd ?1 mAb to CD4+ cells increased<br>
dramatically following activation (Fig. 30). Whereas non-activated cells, at day 0 (Fig. 30A) and<br>
at day 5 (Fig. 30C), exhibited 17-20% positive binding to hBAT, 52% and 77% of CD4+ cells<br>
bound hBAT on day 2 (Fig. 3 OB) and day 5 (Fig. 30D) of activation, respectively. Similar<br>
results were obtained with multiple samples and could also be demonstrated for CD8+ cells.<br>
This demonstrates mat hBAT binding to T cells is increased upon TCR activation.<br>
The dose dependency of this activation was demonstrated by co-localization of hBAT with<br>
CD69. T cell activation is characterized by cell-surface expression of various molecules, some<br>
of which have been shown to be involved in the activation process. hBAT was studied for its co-<br>
expression with different markers including both early and late activation molecules. CD69, an<br>
early activation marker, is up-regulated on T cells upon activation. Four days following<br>
activation, cells were examined for binding of hBAT and anti-CD69 (4°C, 1 hr). Analysis was<br>
performed by flow cytometry on cells negative for PI staining. Quadrants were determined by<br>
isotype controls.<br>
A dose-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells from a normal donor is demonstrated in<br>
figure 31. Upon strong activation (5 µ1/ml of beads conjugated to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28; Fig.<br>
31B) most of the cells, which were capable of binding to hBAT (93%), were activated cells and<br>
were identified by CD69 expression. Increased time of activation also resulted in increase<br>
binding to hBAT beginning at day one of activation. Time dependency of activation could also<br>
be demonstrated and resulted in an increase in hBAT binding beginning at day one of activation.<br>
Interestingly, hBAT binding to both CD4+ and CD8+ cells remained high even after CD69<br>
decrease (day 5) suggesting a correlation of binding with multiple stages of lymphocyte<br>
activation. hBAT binding to CD69+ cells suggests that the expression of hBAT binding protein<br>
is correlated with early activation.<br>
Example 27<br>
Binding of hBAT to activated T cells expressing CD25 and CD40-Ligand<br>
CD25, the high-affinity receptor for IL2, is vital for T-cell expansion and is typically<br>
increased on the surface of activated cells. Chronologically it follows the appearance of CD69<br>
and its expression is extended several days after the down-regulation of CD69.<br>
CD4+ T cells were isolated from a normal donor by negative selection and stimulated for<br>
several days with beads conjugated to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (5µ1/rm). Cells were examined<br>
for binding of hBAT and anti-CD25 (4°C, 1 hr) on day 0 (Fig. 32A), day 1 (Fig. 32B), and day 5<br>
(Fig. 32D) of activation with respect to controls (day 0, Fig. 32A and day 5 of no activation, Fig.<br>
32C). Analysis was performed by flow cytometry on cells negative for PI staining. Quadrants<br>
were determined by isotype controls.<br>
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed a time dependent increase in CD25 expression upon<br>
anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation, beginning at day 1 of stimulation. hBAT co-localized<br>
with CD25 on these activated cells (Fig. 32).<br>
CD25 expression increased from 55% of the cells on day 1 (Fig. 32B) to 93% on day 5<br>
(Fig. 32D) following activation. At both time points the majority of hBAT binding cells were<br>
CD25+ (85% and 98% respectively).<br>
Correlation with activation markers was further extended to the late activation marker<br>
CD40-Ligand (Fig. 33). hBAT binding positively correlated with the expression of CD40-<br>
Ligand in CD4+ (Fig. 33) and CD8+ T cells in a time dependent manner. The results culminate<br>
to suggest that activation of T cells induces the expression of the hBAT binding protein in a<br>
manner that correlates with different activation stages.<br>
Example 28<br>
hBAT increases survival of activated CD4+ cells<br>
To examine whether activated T cells can be further stimulated by the hBAT, human<br>
CD4+ cells were isolated from normal donors by negative selection and activated with a<br>
suboptimal concentration (0.25 µl/ml) of anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Fig. 34). hBAT (0.5µg/ml) was<br>
added 2 days following activation and its effect was evaluated by determining the number of<br>
viable cells. The results indicate that hBAT induced a significant increase in the number of<br>
viable CD4+ cells isolated from the two separate donors (Fig. 34A and B). Control<br>
nonstimulated cells died within eight days of isolation whereas activated cells expanded in a<br>
manner that is typical of lymphocytes, commencing with cell proliferation followed by a stage<br>
of stable cell number leading to a stage dominated by cell death. The addition of hBAT<br>
enhanced the expansion of CD4+ cell and increased the number of cells by 1.5 folds with<br>
respect to cells in the absence of the mAb.<br>
The fact that the efficacy of BAT antibody in vivo is increased in the presence of tumor<br>
together with the results herein, suggests that the increased efficacy may depend on the presence<br>
of activated BAT target cells. Lymphocytes directed against tumor antigens have been observed<br>
in cancer patients, albeit inefficient in the inhibition of tumor growth, and may serve as target<br>
cells for BAT activity. Thus, in view of the results it may be implied that hBAT activates CD4+<br>
cells by stimulating cell proliferation and/or by inhibiting cell death.<br>
Example 29<br>
Binding of hBAT to Daudi and Jurkat cell lines<br>
Mouse BAT-1 was raised against membranes of the Daudi B-cell line and has been shown<br>
to bind human T cells. To verify the specificity of the humanized antibody, hBAT was examined<br>
for its binding to two human cell lines of myeloid origin: Daudi cells - a human B cell<br>
lymphoma line and Jurkat cells - a human T cell leukemia line. hBAT conjugated to FITC was<br>
incubated with Daudi and Jurkat cells at a concentration of 150ug/ml (4°C for 1 hr). Binding<br>
was determined by flow cytometry.<br>
Both cell lines, Daudi (Fig. 35A) and Jurkat (Fig. 35B) bound the humanized antibody.<br>
Moreover, most of the cells in culture of both lines were capable of binding the antibody. An<br>
isotype matched human-IgGl served as a negative control (Fig. 35; isotype control) and<br>
established the reading threshold. Both cell lines demonstrated a similar intensity of antibody<br>
staining suggesting that they express a similar number of hBAT binding molecules.<br>
Example 30<br>
Binding of hBAT to PBL of cancer patients<br>
Following the observation that hBAT is capable of binding human T cells from normal<br>
donors, we compared its ability to bind lymphocytes collected from cancer patients. PBL were<br>
isolated from the blood of a prostate cancer patient by ficoll followed by adherence to tissue<br>
culture plates. Non-adherent cells were examined for binding of hBAT and lymphocyte markers.<br>
Binding was performed at 4°C for 1 hr, and determined by flow cytometry on gated<br>
lymphocytes. Isotype controls were used to determine the quadrants. These patients have<br>
formerly undergone therapy that often affects the presence and phenotype of lymphocytes.<br>
hBAT binding to these cells is a pre-requisite for its activity and as depicted in figure 36,<br>
resembles the binding to lymphocytes of normal donors. Although total lymphocyte numbers<br>
were low, hBAT could still bind a large proportion of the lymphocyte subpopulations which we<br>
examined including 39% of CD4+ cells, 60% of CD8+ cells and 68% of B cells.<br>
Example 31<br>
Cross reactivity of hBAT with human, primate and murine tissues<br>
The purpose of this study was to examine the cross reactivity of hBAT-1 monoclonal<br>
antibody with a range of normal human tissue. This study involved immunohistochemical<br>
testing of the monoclonal antibody against-a range of human tissues. A comparison of in vitro<br>
cross-reactivity in tissues from cynomologus monkey and CD-1 mice was also undertaken.<br>
(i) Tissue source<br>
The tissues used in this study were each obtained from three unrelated donors to minimize<br>
the chances of donor specific factors affecting antibody binding. The human tissue was provided<br>
by an ethical source. The primate and murine tissues used in this study were obtained from two<br>
animals of each species, by an ethical source. The murine and primate are potential test systems<br>
that may be evaluated in pre-clinical toxicology Studies. The tissues selected were those<br>
specified in the FDA Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal<br>
Antibody Products for Human Use (Office of Biologies Research and Review. Center for<br>
Biologies Evaluation and Research FDA. 1997) and the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in<br>
the European Community Vol. 3a (Production and Quality Control of Monoclonal Antibodies<br>
Dec. 1994, 3AB4a). All tissues used in this investigation were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and<br>
stored at or below -70°C until required. Cryostat sections were prepared at a nominal thickness<br>
of 5 µm to 8 µm. The positive control was Jurkat E6 cells. Samples of fresh blood were<br>
collected from 3 donors and smears prepared on the day of use.<br>
(ii) FITC Conjugation<br>
The humanized monoclonal hBAT-1 antibody was conjugated to FITC by the Custom<br>
Antibody Services Division of Serotec Ltd (ISO 9001, Certification) before the study was<br>
started. The final concentration of the conjugated antibody was 1.99 mg/ml.<br>
Initial validation of the methodology was performed on control tissue (Jurkat E6 cell line)<br>
to determine the titer concentration for antibody-tissue binding with frozen sections and other<br>
conditions relevant to the proper performance of the antibody-tissue binding. Slides were<br>
microscopically examined and scored subjectively against the antibody specificity (Table 21).<br>
Based on these data, the concentrations of hBAT-1 that were used throughout the study were<br>
1:100, 1:250 and 1:500.<br>
positive staining and 0 refers to no staining/signal. +++ refers to strong visual signal, ++ refers<br>
to good visual signal and + refers to weak visual signal.<br>
(iii) Controls.<br>
Negative control reactions, in which the antibody was substituted with a buffer, were<br>
carried out for each tissue. Each detection reaction included positive control cells, Jurkat E6,<br>
reacted at the three predetermined dilutions of the antibody. This allowed the consistency of the<br>
reaction to be monitored. Sections of thyroid, incubated with anti actin antibody, were included<br>
in each assay run as controls for the detection system.<br>
(iv) Cross-reactivity Assessment<br>
Sections of each tissue were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) to confirm then-<br>
identity and suitability for the study. Sections were also incubated with anti smooth muscle actin<br>
(SMA; Table 22) or rabbit anti human transferrin control sera, which showed the tissues were<br>
suitable for immunohistochemistry. Three sections of each of the tissues were prepared and<br>
incubated with the antibody, which had been conjugated to FITC, at concentrations of 1:100,<br>
1:250 and 1:500 as determined during the validation phase. After washing in buffer and<br>
blocking with normal serum, the sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary and<br>
tertiary antibodies for alkaline-phosphatase detection, and counter-stained with haematoxylin<br>
before microscopical examination to determine sites of binding.<br>
The FITC -conjugated staining method with Alkaline Phosphatase detection contained the<br>
following steps:<br>
1. Air dry cryostat sections.<br>
2. Fix by immersion in acetone, 10 minutes at room temperature<br>
3. Air dry.<br>
4. Buffer wash.<br>
5. Normal serum, 1:5, at least 20 minutes.<br>
6. Buffer wash<br>
7. 1022292 test FITC conjugated antibody at 1: 100, 1 :250 and 1 :500, :. overnight at 2-<br>
8°C.<br>
8. Buffer wash.<br>
9. Monoclonal anti FITC antibody, 1:50,30 minutes.<br>
10. Buffer wash.<br>
11. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody, 1 :200, 2 hours. 12. Buffer wash.<br>
13. Vector red and levamisole, 20 minutes.<br>
14. Buffer wash.<br>
15. Counterstain and mount.<br>
Endogenous alkaline phosphatase was minimized by using Levamisole incorporated into<br>
the chromogen. In tissues where endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity could not be<br>
suppressed (human colon, ileurn, placenta and endothelium, murine colon and pancreas, primate<br>
stomach, ileum and prostate), horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody at 1:200 for 2 hours<br>
was used, followed by Diaminobenzidene (DAB) reagent for 20 minutes.<br>
(v) Results<br>
Samples of individual tissues stained with H&amp;E were examined for quality of tissue,<br>
presence of normal histological features and adequacy of preservation. All samples that were<br>
tested were considered to be suitable for the purposes of this study. Positive staining was<br>
achieved in the Jurkat E6 cell line for hBAT-1 and in the thyroid sections treated with smooth<br>
muscle actin. As the controls gave the expected results, the test was considered valid.<br>
Individual cross reactivity results for hBAT-1 and human tissues are shown in Tables 22.<br>
Positive staining was detected in blood vessels human endothelium at a dilution of 1:100 and<br>
was probably a result of hBAT-1 binding to lymphocytes. Positive staining indicates probable<br>
tissue binding of the humanized monoclonal hBAT-1 antibody. No staining, i.e. cross reactivity<br>
with hBAT-1, was observed in spleen sections, blood smears or other human tissues (except<br>
human endothelium - blood vessels). None of the murine and primate tissues showed evidence<br>
of cross reactivity with hBAT-1.<br>
