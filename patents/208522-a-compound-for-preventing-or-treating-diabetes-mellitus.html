				<td>DESCRIPTION Nitrogen containing 5-membered heterocyclic compounds<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel nitrogen containing 5-membered heterocyclic compound having an excellent hypoglycemic action and hypolipidemic action, which is useful as an agent for preventing or treating diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, inflammatory diseases, arteriosclerosis, etc.<br>
The present invention also relates to an agent for preventing or treating diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia or impaired glucose tolerance, which comprises a nitrogen containing 5-membered heterocyclic compound.<br>
The present invention further relates to a retinoid-related receptor function regulating agent or an insulin resistance improving agent, which comprises a nitrogen containing 5-membered heterbcyclic compound.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
JP-A 10-72434 discloses a 2,4-substituted aniline derivative of the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 represents alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, or the like; R2 represents hydrogen atom, alkyl, haloalkyl. or the like; R3 represents alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, or the like; X represents oxygen, sulfur, NR5 or a single bond; Q represents an azole or the like, and a herbicide comprising<br>
it.<br>
However, said derivative is not reported to possess<br>
hypoglycemic action and hypolipidemic action.<br>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPART), a member oÂ£ the intranuclear hormone receptor<br><br>
2<br>
superfamily, which is typically exemplified by steroid hormone receptors and thyroid hormone receptors, plays an important role as a master regulator in the differentiation of adipose cells with its expression induced in the very early stage of adipose cell differentiation. PPARY forms a dimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) by binding to a ligand, and binds to a responsive site of the target gene in the nucleus to directly control (activate) transcription efficiency.  In recent years, the possibility that 15-deoxy-   12-14 prostaglandin J2. a metabolite of prostaglandin D2, serves as an endogenous ligand for PPARf , has been suggested, and it has been shown that a class of insulin resistance enhancers, typically exemplified by thiazolidinedione derivatives , possess ligand activity for PPARY, and that its potency is proportional to its hypoglycemic action or adipose cell differentiation-promoting action [Cell, vol. 83, p. 803 (1995): the Journal of Biological Chemistry, vol. 270, p. 12953 (1995); Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 39, p. 655 (1996)]. Furthermore, in recent years, it has been shown that 1) PPAR Y is expressed in cultured cells of human liposarcoma origin, whose proliferation is ceased by the addition of a PPART ligand [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 94, p. 237 (1997)3. 2) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, typically exemplified by indomethacin and fenoprofen, have PPART ligand activity [the Journal of Biological Chemistry, vol. 272, p. 3406 (1997)], 3) PPART is expressed at high levels in activated macrophages , with the transcription of a gene involved in inflammation inhibited by the addition of a ligand therefor [Nature, vol. 391. p. 79 (1998)], and 4) PPART ligands suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF?. IL-l?, IL-6) by monocytes [Nature, vol.<br>
391, p. 82 (1998)].<br>
There is a demand for development of a novel compound useful as an agent for preventing or treating diabetes<br><br>
3<br>
mellitus, hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, inflammatory diseases, arteriosclerosis etc., and having pharmaceutically excellent properties such as low side effects, etc.<br>

method of synthesis or separation. For example, when an optical isomer is present in Compound (II), the optical isomer separated from said compound is also included in Compound (II).<br>
Optical isomers can be produced by a per se known method.  Specifically, optical isomers are obtained by using an optically active synthesis intermediate, or optically resolving a racemate of the final product by a conventional method.<br>
Examples of the methods of optical resolution include per se known methods, such as the fractional recrystallization method, the chiral column method, and the diastereomer method.<br>
1)	Fractional recrystallization method<br>
A method wherein a salt is formed between a racemate and an optically active compound [e.g., (+ ) -mandelic acid, {-)-mandelic acid, (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-tartaric acid, ( + )-1-phenethylamine, ( -)-1-phenethylamine, cinchonine, (-)-cinchonidine, brucine], which salt is separated by fractional recrystallization, etc., and, if desired, subjected to a neutralization process, to yield a free optical isomer.<br>
2)	Chiral column method<br>
A method wherein a racemate or a salt thereof is applied to a column for optical isomer separation (chiral column) .  In the case of liquid chromatography, for example , optical isomers are separated by adding a mixture of the optical isomers to a chiral column such as ENANTIO-OVM (produced by Tosoh Corporation) or CHIRAL series produced by DAICEL CHEMICAL IND. , and developing it in water, various buffers (e.g. , phosphate buffer) , an organic solvent (e.g. , ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, diethylamine), or a solvent mixture thereof.  In the case of gas chromatography, for example.<br><br>
78<br>
a chiral column such as CP-Chirasil-DeX CB (produced by GL Science) is used to separate optical isomers.<br>
3) Diastereomer method<br>
A method wherein a racemate mixture and an optically active reagent are chemically reacted to yield a diastereomer mixture, which is then subjected to ordinary means of separation (e.g., fractional recrystallization, chromatography) to obtain single substances, which are subjected to a chemical reaction such as acid hydrolysis to cut off the optically active reagent moiety, whereby the desired optical isomer is obtained.  For example, when Compound (I) has hydroxy or primary or secondary amino in the molecule thereof, said compound, an optically active organic acid (e.g. , MTPA [ a -methoxy- (X -<br>
(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid], (-)-menthoxyacetic acid) and the like may be subjected to a condensing reaction to yield a diastereomer of an ester or amide," respectively.<br>
On the other hand, when Compound (I) has a carboxyl group, said compound and an optically active amine or an alcohol reagent may be subjected to a condensing reaction to yield a diastereomer of an amide or ester, respectively.  The diastereomer thus separated is converted to an optical isomer of the original compound by subjecting it to an acid hydrolysis or basic hydrolysis reaction.<br>

Test compounds were mixed in a powdery diet (CE-2, Japan Clea) at the concentration of 0.01% (compounds of Examples 12, 30, 89), 0.005% (compounds of Examples 38 , 40, 44, 181, 184, 262, 283), or 0.001% (compounds of Examples 9, 156, 167, 172, 174, 176, 189), and freely given to KKAy mice (9 to 12 weeks old, 5 mice per group) , a model of obese and type 2 diabetes mellitus, for four days. During this period, water was given freely.  Blood was sampled from orbital venous plexus and plasma was separated.  Total cholesterol levels were determined by using L type Wako Cholesterol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).<br><br>
82<br>
Precipitation reagent for apoB containing lipoprotein was added to a part of the plasma to precipitate non-HDL lipoprotein, and cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) in the resulting supernatant was determined.  The plasma anti-arteriosclerosis index [(HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol)X100] was calculated by using these cholesterol levels.  The results are given in Table 2.<br>
In the Table, "Total cholesterol lowering action (%)" represents the percent reduction (%) of total cholesterol level in the treatment group, when the total cholesterol level in the non-treatment group is taken as 100%.  "Plasma anti-arteriosclerosis index-enhancing action (%)" represents the percent increase (%) of plasma anti-arteriosclerosis index in the treatment group, when the plasma anti-arteriosclerosis index in the non-treatment group is taken as 100%.<br>
