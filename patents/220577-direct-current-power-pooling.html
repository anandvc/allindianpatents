DIRECT CURRENT POWER POOLING BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of powering a system comprising multiple components, and in particular to a system and entities for DC power pooling.<br>
[0002] Systems comprising multiple modules, such as communication systems, commonly comprise modules having on-board power supplies that are connected to a common mains. In order to provide uninterrupted operation of the system, including during failure of power mains, systems often comprise a back-up power supply, such as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which during a power interrupt functions to supply AC power to each of modules in the system.<br>
[0003] The combination of modules each comprising an on-board power supply often leads to a less than optimum situation, in which the on-board power supply of some modules are operating at low utilization, while the on-board power supply of other modules are approaching or have reached maximum utilization. Power supply longevity is at least partially a function of the utilization rate, in which typically a highly utilized power supply begins to increase in temperature. This increase in temperature leads to a shortened life for the power supply.<br>
[0004] Certain modules, for example an Ethernet switch having power over Ethernet functionality, may have a need for additional power above that available from the on-board power supply. Prior art systems require a dedicated additional power supply to be added as a module, feeding the additional required power. Such a dedicated additional power supply is required despite the on-board power supply of other modules in the system being at low utilization, thus having spare power available. Furthermore, in prior art systems, a dedicated additional power supply will Typically be initially underutilized, and will only experience optimum utilization as the system power needs grow. This underutilized dedicated additional power supply is thus unavailable in the event that one of the other modules in the system has reached maximum utilization of its on-board power supply.<br>
[0005] In the event that one of the modules in the system experiences an on¬board power supply failure, the prior art further does not teach an arrangement for supplying power to the module in place of the local power supply. Furthermore, the<br><br>
prior art does not teach an arrangement in which the utilization of local power supplies is optimized.<br>
[0006] U.S. Patent S/N 6,125,448 issued to Schwan et al. discloses a method and apparatus of powering components on a network by using a load-share technique and by using over-voltage and current limiting circuitry. Under normal operation of the power subsystem, the load will be powered directly from the power subsystem. Unfortunately, no means of optimization of overall network power is described.<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent S/N 5,745,670 issued to Linde discloses a fault tolerant power supply system including a plurality of nodes coupled to a common power distribution bus. Under normal operation of the power subsystem, the load will be powered directly from the power subsystem, and excess power is available to be supplied to the bus. Upon failure of the local power supply, bus power is supplied under certain conditions. No means of optimization of overall network power is described, and no means of centralized control of individual local power supplies exist.<br>
[0008] IEEE 1394 specification, "IEEE Standard for a High Performance Serial Bus", IEEE Std 1394-1995, Aug. 30, 1996, describes a high speed serial bus that includes the capability for sourcing power from one "node" to another over a power bus coupling the nodes. This power sourcing capability introduces potential complexities into the process of configuring the power source/sink relationships between a set of nodes or systems, such as those coupled by a 1394 specification compliant bus. For example, at any given time, one node should be providing or sourcing power and the remaining nodes should either consume power as a power sink, power themselves, or act as a power "conduit" distributing power from the power source to nodes coupled to the power distribution bus or cable (but not directly coupled to the power source). Such a layout does not teach an arrangement or a means allowing for optimization of overall network power.<br>
[0009] U.S. Patent S/N 6,539,484 issued to Cruz describes an electronically configurable physical arrangement of power transistors. The arrangement is configurable under externally derived electrical signals to: sink power to a node from a power bus segment; source power from the node to a power bus segment; and distribute power through the node. Such an arrangement allows flexibility and power sharing, however it does not optimize overall network power.<br><br>
[00010]	There is therefore a need for an arrangement in which the<br>
utilization of local power supplies is optimized.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[000151]	The present embodiments enable a system of power pooling<br>
.among and between entities having at least a first mode in which the entity provides more DC electrical power than it consumes and a second mode in which the entity consumes more DC electrical power than it provides, the power pooling system being operative to function under at least one pooling controller.<br>
[000152]        Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is applicable to other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
[000153] Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which is a simplified symbolic illustration of a DC power pooling system constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Fig. 1, there is provided a DC power pooling system including a plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities, here shown as disparate operating assemblies, such as a water pump 100 operated by a DC electrical generator 102, a shaver 110 operated by an AC/DC wall socket converter 112 connected to AC mains power; a DC refrigerator 120 operated by a DC battery assembly 122 and a DC motor operated sawmill 130 operated by a DC generator 132. It is appreciated that each of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities 100 &amp; 102,110 &amp; 112,120 &amp; 122 and 130 &amp; 132 has at least a first operative mode in which it may provide more electrical power than it consumes and a second operative mode in which it may consume more electrical power than it provides.<br>
[000154]	DC    electrical    power   interconnections,    here    designated<br>
collectively by reference numeral 134, interconnect the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities, permitting electrical power flow thereto and therefrom. The DC electrical power interconnections may include a DC bus 136.<br>
[000155] At least one pooling controller 138 is operative to vary at least one of voltage, output impedance and current of electrical power provided by one or more of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities.<br><br>
[000156]	The controller 138 receives from the entities which it controls<br>
information as to the capabilities and needs of each entity. In practical terms, the capability of each entity is its DC power providing capability and the needs of each entity are its DC power needs. Thus, for the entity including the waterpump 100 and the generator 102, the capability is the maximum KW output of the generator 102 and the needs are KW power currently needed by the pump. For the entity including the shaver 110 and the AC/DC wall socket, the capability is the maximum wattage output of the wall socket and the needs are power currently needed by the shaver. Alternatively, controller 138 may receive from the entities which it controls at least two datum selected from among the group consisting of the current DC electrical power consuming needs, the current DC electrical power providing abilities and the current DC excess providing ability or shortfall.<br>
[000157]        The controller 138, based on predetermined or programmable criteria, governs in real time the electrical power supplied by each of the electrical power sources in each of the entities controlled by the controller. Power that is supplied by an electrical power source of an entity which does not need all of the power, is provided to one or more entities that do need the power. Thus it is appreciated that the controller 138 effects power pooling of the power supply resources of the entities which it controls and allocates the pooled power among those entities.<br>
[000158]        The system of the present invention, as exemplified in Fig. 1 employs communication between one or more controller and plural entities controlled thereby to provide the controller with current data regarding both the needs and the capabilities of the controlled entities and to provide control instructions to the power sources of such entities. These control instructions, which may be provided along the power connections or along dedicated communication lines or other paths may vary one or more of voltage V, output impedance Z and current I of electrical power provided by the various DC power sources.<br>
[000159] Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which is a simplified symbolic illustration of a DC power pooling system constructed and operative in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Fig. 2, there is provided a DC power pooling system including a plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities, here shown as disparate operating assemblies of a somewhat imaginary motor vehicle, such as a vehicle computer 200<br><br>
'associated with a backup battery assembly 202, a vehicle audio/visual system 210 associated with a backup battery assembly 212; a vehicle alarm 220 associated with a backup battery assembly 222 and a power window drive assembly 230 associated with a backup battery assembly 232. It is appreciated that each of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities 200 &amp; 202, 210 &amp; 212, 220 &amp; 222 and 230 &amp; 232 has at least a first operative mode in which it may provide more electrical power than it consumes and a second operative mode in which it may consume more electrical power than it provides.<br>
[000160] DC electrical power interconnections, here designated collectively by reference numeral 234, interconnect the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities and permitting electrical power flow thereto and therefrom. The DC electrical power interconnections may include a DC bus 236.<br>
[000161] At least one dynamic closed loop pooling controller 238 is operative to vary at least one of voltage, output impedance and current of electrical power provided by one or more of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities.<br>
[000162] The dynamic closed loop pooling controller 238 receives from the entities which it controls information at least as to the initial capabilities and needs of each entity. Additionally controller 238 receives real time feedback information as to the performance of the various entities. This feedback may be in one or more of many possible forms and preferably reflects actual power consumption by each of the controlled entities. A preferred metric of feedback is current consumption by each of the entities. Another preferred metric is the temperature of the entities.<br>
[000163]        In practical terms, the capability of each entity is its DC power providing capability and the needs of each entity are its DC power needs. Thus, for the entity including the vehicle computer 200 and the backup batteiy assembly 202, the capability is the maximum wattage output of the backup batten' assembly 202 and the needs are wattage currently needed by the computer. For the entity including power window drive assembly 230 and backup battery assembly 232, the capability is the maximum wattage of the backup battery assembly 232 and the needs are power currently needed by the power window drive assembly 230.<br>
[000164]        Typical feedback supplied to controller 238 from power window drive assembly 230 is the current draw, which varies greatly depending on<br><br>
whether the window drives are operated and whether the windows are being opened or closed.<br>
[000165]	The controller 238, based on predetermined or programmable<br>
criteria, and based on ffie real time feedback received thereby from the various entities, governs in real time the electrical power supplied by each of the electrical power sources in each of the entities controlled by the controller. Power that is supplied by an electrical power source of an entity which does not need all of the " power, is provided to one or more entities that do need the power. Thus it is appreciated that the controller 238 effects power pooling of the power supply resources of the entities which it controls, and allocates the pooled power among those entities.<br>
[000166]        The system of the present invention, as exemplified in Fig. 2 employs communication between one or more controller and plural entities controlled thereby to provide the controller with current feedback data regarding both the current needs and the capabilities of the controlled entities and their performance and to provide control instructions to the power sources of such entities. These control instructions, which may be provided along the power connections or along dedicated communication lines or other paths govern electrical power provided by at least one of the DC electrical power consuming and providing entities.<br>
[000167] Reference is now made to Fig. 3, which is a simplified symbolic illustration of a DC power pooling system constructed and operative in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Fig. 3, there is provided a DC power pooling system including a plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities, here shown as disparate functional equipment located in disparate rooms of a hospital, such as x-ray diagnostic equipment 300 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 302, operating room equipment 310 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 312; hospital kitchen equipment 320 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 322 and birthing room equipment 330 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 332. It is appreciated that each of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities 300 &amp; 302, 310 &amp; 312, 320 &amp; 322 and 330 &amp; 332 has at least a first operative mode in which it may provide more electrical power than it consumes and a second operative mode in which it may consume more electrical power than it provides.<br><br>
[000168]	DC    electrical   power   interconnections,   here   designated<br>
collectively by reference numeral 334, interconnect the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities and permitting electrical power flow thereto and therefrom. The DC electrical power interconnections may include a DC bus 336.<br>
[000169] At least one optimization driven pooling controller 338 is operative to vary at least one of voltage, output impedance and current of electrical power provided by one or more of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities.<br>
[000170]        The optimization driven pooling controller 338 receives from the entities which it controls information at least as to the initial capabilities and needs of each entity. Additionally controller 338 receives real time feedback information as to the performance and utilization of the various entities. This feedback may be in one or more of many possible forms and preferably reflects actual power consumption by each of the controlled entities. A preferred metric of feedback is current consumption by each of the entities. A second preferred metric of feedback is percentage of utilization.<br>
[000171]        In practical terms, the capability of each entity is its DC power providing capability and the needs-of each entity are its DC power needs. Thus, for the entity including the x-ray diagnostic equipment 300 and AC mains supplied AD/DC power rectifier 302, the capability is the maximum wattage output of the AC mains supplied AD/DC power rectifier 302 and the needs are wattage currently needed by the x-ray diagnostic equipment 300.<br>
[000172]        The controller 338, based on predetermined or programmable criteria, and based on the real time feedback received thereby from the various entities, governs in real time the electrical power supplied by each of the electrical power sources in each of the entities controlled by the controller. Power that is supplied by an electrical power source of an entity which does not need all of the power, is provided to one or more entities that do need the power based on predetermined or programmable priority. It is appreciated that birthing room equipment 330 is of a higher priority than hospital kitchen equipment 320, which can accept a power outage for a short period of time. Furthermore, a demand for birthing room equipment 330 can not be delayed, and thus has a higher priority than x-ray diagnostic equipment 3 00. The priority of operating room equipment 310 varies in time, being of high priority during an actual operation, and being of lower priority<br><br>
when the operating room is not utilized. The use of x-ray diagnostic equipment 300 is typically a revenue enhancing service, and therefore optimization of its use, at or near its maximum capacity is desirable by proper scheduling of both the use of, and power delivery to, each of entities 300 &amp; 302, 310 &amp; 312, 320 &amp; 322 and 330 &amp; 332. Thus it is appreciated that the controller 338 effects optimization driven power pooling of the power supply resources of the entities which it controls and allocates the pooled power among those entities. Furthermore, controller 338 optimizes use of the hospital equipment by scheduling the use of each of entities 300 &amp; 302,310 &amp; 312,320 &amp; 322 and 330 &amp; 332.<br>
[000173]        The system of the present invention, as exemplified in Fig. 3 employs communication between one or more controller and plural entities controlled thereby to provide the controller with current feedback data regarding both the current needs and the capabilities of the controlled entities and their performance and to provide control instructions to the power sources of such entities. These control instructions, which may be provided along the power connections or along dedicated communication lines or other paths govern interchange of electrical power between the plurality of DC electrical consuming and providing entities, and provide optimization of at least one of temperature, electrical load and percentage of available power being supplied of the plurality of DC electrical consuming and providing entities.<br>
[000174] Reference is now made to Fig. 4, which is a simplified symbolic illustration of a DC power pooling system constructed and operative in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. As seen in Fig. 4, there is provided a DC power pooling system including a plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities, here shown as disparate functional heating, cooling or ventilation consumers, such as chicken coop ventilators 400 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 402, hot house ventilators 410 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 412; sauna room equipment 420 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 422 and industrial refrigerator 430 powered by an AC mains supplied AC/DC power rectifier 432. It is appreciated that each of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities 400 &amp; 402, 410 &amp; 412,420 &amp; 422 and 430 &amp; 432 has at least a first operative mode in which it may provide more electrical power than it consumes and a<br><br>
second operative mode in which it may consume more electrical power than it provides.<br>
[000175] DC electrical power interconnections, here designated collectively by reference numeral '434, interconnect the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities and permitting electrical power flow thereto and therefrom. The DC electrical power interconnections may include a DC bus 436.<br>
[000176] At least one priority driven pooling controller 438 is operative in accordance with predetermined priorities relating to at least one of temperature, electrical load and percentage of available power being supplied of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities to vary at least one of voltage, output impedance and current of electrical power provided by one or more of the plurality of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities.<br>
[000177]        The priority driven pooling controller 438 receives from the entities which it controls information at least as to the initial capabilities and needs of each entity. Additionally priority driven pooling controller 438 receives real time feedback information as to the performance and utilization of the various entities. This feedback may be in one or more of many possible forms and preferably reflects at least one of temperature, electrical load and percentage of available power being supplied by each of the controlled entities.<br>
[000178]        In practical terms, the capability of each entity is its DC power providing capability and the needs of each entity are its DC power needs. Thus, for the entity including the chicken coop ventilating equipment 400 and AC mains supplied AD/DC power rectifier 402, the capability is the maximum wattage output of the AC mains supplied AD/DC power rectifier 402 and the needs are wattage currently needed by the chicken coop ventilating equipment 400. Similarly, for the entity including the industrial refrigerator 430 and AC mains supplied AD/DC power rectifier 432, the capability is the maximum wattage output of the AC mains supplied AD/DC power rectifier 432 and the needs are wattage currently needed by industrial refrigerator 430.<br>
[000179]        The priority driven pooling controller 438, based on predetermined or programmable criteria, and based on the real time feedback received thereby from the various entities, governs in real time the electrical power supplied by each of the electrical power sources in each of the entities controlled by the controller. Power that is supplied by an electrical power source of an entity which does not need<br><br>
all of the power, is provided to one or more entities that do need the power based on predetermined or programmable priority. It is appreciated that chicken coop ventilating equipment 400 is of a higher priority than industrial refrigerator 430, since bdustrial refrigerator 430 can accept a power outage for a short period of time. Any rise in the temperature of chicken coop 400 will quickly result in a negative outcome for chickens raised in chicken coop 400. Similarly, the priority of hothouse ventilators 410 is greater than industrial refrigerator 430, but is lower than the priority of sauna room equipment 420, since the users of sauna room equipment 420 are relatively sensitive to temperature changes. Thus it is appreciated that the priority driven pooling controller 438 effects power pooling of the power supply resources of each of entities 400 &amp; 402,410 &amp; 412,420 &amp; 422 and 430 &amp; 432 which it controls and allocates the pooled power among those entities, with priority being allocated according to predetermined priorities relating to at least one of temperature, electrical load and percentage of available power being supplied.<br>

These control instructions, which may be provided along the power connections or along dedicated communication lines or other paths govern interchange of electrical power between the plurality of DC electrical consuming and providing entities, operative in accordance with predetermined priorities relating to at least one of temperature, electrical load and percentage of available power being supplied of the plurality of DC electrical consuming and providing entities.<br>

[000184]	The priority driven pooling controller 538 receives from the<br>
entities which it controls information at least as to the initial capabilities and needs of each entity. Additionally controller 53 8 receives real time feedback information as to the performance and utilization of the various entities. This feedback may be in one or more of many possible forms and preferably reflects actual power consumption by each of the controlled entities. A preferred metric of feedback is current consumption by each of the entities. Another preferred metric of feedback is the current priority level requested by each of the entities.<br>
[000185]        In practical terms, the capability of each entity is its DC power providing capability and the needs of each entity are its DC power needs.

The priority of control tower 500 may vary during the day, and the priority of military radar equipment 530 may vary based on perceived threats. Thus there may be predetermined or programmable variables for priority, with the priority levels of various entities changing over time. Thus it is appreciated that the controller 538 effects priority driven power pooling of the power supply resources of the entities that it controls and allocates the pooled power among those entities in accordance with predetermined priorities relating to the individual entities.<br>

As seen in Fig. 17, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the communications system comprises a power spine node 1150, of the type described hereinabove in relation to Fig. 13A and Fig. 13B, which preferably provides power community functionality among a plurality of data communication nodes, which preferably, but not necessarily, each have their own internal power supplies which are connected directly to an AC mains through outlet strip 1120.<br>

The combination of optional data communication switch 1220 and the data portion of bi¬directional power bus 1210 provides an alternative or addition to a conventional uplink connection conventionally employed by Ethernet switches.<br>
[000255] One or more of the various data communication nodes, such as nodes 1104, 1106 and 1240 as well as the power bus power supply module 1140 and the battery pack 1108 are each, individually, connected to AC power mains, typically via a outlet strip 1120.

[000257]	The   present   invention   constitutes   an   important<br>
contribution to bringing reliability of data communication into line with that presently existing in conventional telephony, also called plain old telephone service (POTS). An important factor in reliability is percentage uptime of a communications system for each user. POTS telephony has long been characterized by 99.999% uptime. This is not presently the case in data communication, inter aha due to failures in the supply of power to the communications system and to elements thereof:<br>
[000258] In order to try to overcome failures in the supply of power, designers have mandated the use of UPS (uninterrupted power supply) and RPS (redundant power supply) modules. The use of UPS modules involves multiple voltage and current conversions, which are energy wasteful. The use of UPS and RPS modules both result in significant energy waste.<br>
[000259] The present invention also addresses another design issue that has long plagued designers of equipment, and in particular communication equipment, namely the requirement that the power supplies provided within such equipment be capable of handling peak power requirements, even though peak power operation rarely or never occurred. Aside from the resultant increased cost and lowered efficiency, significant issues of lowered mean time between failures (MTBF) arise due to significant generation of heat within the equipment caused by the required high peak power. A farther problem involves the increased electromagnetic interference from having multiple switching power supplies in close proximity, thus necessitating additional shielding.<br>
[000260] The present invention addresses the aforethe long-felt design issues by providing a power community wherein nodes of a system obtain back-up power and peak power from each other or from one or more common sources interconnected by power spine node 1150 of Figs. 13A and 13B, or power spine module 1122 of Figs. 11 and 12. The present invention thus provides diversity of power sources available to each node of the data communications system at any given<br><br>
time, with minimal redundancy in equipment and minimal voltage and current conversions. Thus, failure of an internal power source for any communication module connected to power spine node 1150 of Figs. 13 A and 13B, or power spine module 1122 of Figs. Jl and 12, need not result in the failure of the communication node, since power may be supplied to the communication node over power spine node 1150 or power spine module 1122, from one or more common sources interconnected by power spine node 1150 or power spine module 1122. The present invention further enables the use of power supplies in communication which are incapable of meeting peak power requirements of such equipment, by providing a reserve source of peak power from one or more common source interconnected by power spine node 1150 or power spine module 1122. The present invention further provides for a distributed uninterruptible power supply, with battery pack 1108 being useable by any communication module connected to power spine node 1150, or power spine module 1122, without the requirement for conversion to AC power. The present invention also enables some of the system equipment, which currently includes an AC/DC power supply, to be provided without such a power supply, the DC power being supplied from one or more common source interconnected by power spine node 1150, or power spine module 1122. System equipment so supplied without an internal AC/DC power supply may thus be made substantially smaller, particularly in critical dimensions, such as height, which can thus be below one height unit in a 19 inch rack-mount environment (1U).<br>
[000261] Reference is now made to Figs. 18A and 18B, which are simplified block diagram illustrations of two alternative embodiments of a communications system of the type shown in Fig. 17 constructed and operative in a ring topology as shown in Fig. 13b and providing power distribution.<br>

[000263] Examples of such data communication nodes include an Ethernet switch 1104 and an Ethernet switch having power over Ethernet functionality 1106. Preferably, Ethernet switch having power over Ethernet functionality 1106 conforms to IEEE 803.2af standard. Other data communication nodes that may be in<br><br>
operative engagement with power spine node 1150 include router 1240, a bridge 1250. a file server 1260 and an IP phone gateway 1270. One or more of the various data communication nodes, such as nodes 1104, 1106.1240.1260 and 1270 as well as power bus power supply module 1140 and battery pack 1108 are each, individually, connected to AC power mains, typically via outlet strip 1120. No connection is illustrated between bridge 1250 and outlet strip 1120. since bridge 1250 receives power exclusively from power spine node 1150 in accordance with the principle of the current invention.<br>
[000264] Power spine node 1150 preferably comprises a bi-directional power bus designated generally by reference numeral 1210 which interconnects data communication nodes in a ring topology, preferably via respective input and output supply interface units (SIUs) 1300, each SIU 1300 being associated with one of the various data communication nodes, such as nodes 1104, 1106, 1240 - 1270, and permits power sharing therebetween. Bi-directional power bus 1210 is completed through each individual SIU 1300, thus each SIU 1300 provides protection for bi¬directional power bus 1210. In one embodiment, each SIU 1300 is located within the data communication node with which it is associated. In another embodiment, one or more SIU 1300 are collocated within power spine node 1150, without exceeding the scope of the invention. In yet another embodiment, one or more SIU 1300 are physically collocated on bi-directional power bus 1210, without exceeding the scope of the invention. Bi-directional power bus 1210 preferably also connects the various data communication nodes to power bus power supply module 1140 and to battery pack 1108 providing back up battery power as well as peak power. Power bus power supply module 1140 and battery pack 1108 may be mounted on the same rack as one or more of nodes 1104, 1106, 1240 - 1270 or may be located elsewhere.<br>
[000265] Bi-directional power bus 1210 comprises a data portion and a power portion.

A controllable resistor 1926 is interposed between current sensor 1580 and operational amplifier 1984 in order to enable control of the voltage/current relationship of the power supply.<br>
[000429] PSC controller 1928 receives inputs from second voltage sensor 1840 connected at the output of PSC 1345, current sensor 1580 and a temperature sensor 1750. PSC controller 1928 provides a control signal output to controllable resistor 1926 and a control signal to controllable reference voltage source 1908. In addition, PSC controller 1928 communicates via data portion 1520 and the data portion of bi-directional power bus 1210 from power pooling controller 1230 (Fig. 17, 18A, 18B, 19A and 19B). Temperature sensor 1750 is operative to detect the operating temperature of internal power supply 1330, thus providing data input useful in preventing early failure of internal power supply 1.330. PSC 1345 thus affects desired power sharing in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, being adaptable by commands received from power pooling controller 1230 in real time to various operational modes of the system.<br>
[000430] Reference is now made to Figs. 26A, 26B and 26C, which illustrate the voltage/current relationship provided by the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 25A - 25C, in which the x-axis represents output current Iout, and the y-axis<br><br>
represents voltage output Vout. Turning initially to Fig. 26A, it is seen that a linear relationship, whose slope, defined as AV/AI, is established and varied by the embodiments illustrated in each of Figs. 25A, 25B and 25C. Thus, an initial relationship as illustrated by line 1990 having a first slope, may be changed to a relationship having a steeper slope as illustrated by iine 1994, or a relationship having a shallower slope as illustrated by line 1992. The specific relationship is realized by changing the voltage reference to an analog amplifier in each embodiment in response to the sensed output current. Various possible real-time modifications of the voltage current relationship in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention are represented by various curves drawn in dashed lines in Fig. 26A. These modifications are realized in the embodiments of Figs. 25A - 25C by control signals provided by PSC controller 1928 to controllable voltage reference 1908 and to respective controllable resistor 1926. The present invention enables the relative contributions of the power supplies engaged in current sharing to be modified in real time. This contrasts with conventional current sharing wherein the relative contributions of the power supplies are determined in advance.<br>
[000431] Fig. 26B illustrates the behavior of a first of two power supplies of the types shown in any of Figs. 25 A - 25C, and. Fig. 26C illustrates the behavior of a second of two power supplies when their output voltages are connected in parallel to a load, thus establishing a common output voltage, Vi, with a shared output current. Line 1996 represents a first relationship of voltage and current for each of the first and second power supplies, illustrated in Fig. 25B and 25C, respectively. The operation of PSC controller 1928 causes first power supply, as shown by line 1996 in Fig. 26B, to contribute 60% of its total output power and a second power supply, as shown by line 1996 in Fig. 26C, to contribute 20% of its total output power. It is a particular feature of the present invention that by controlling the voltage/current characteristics of multiple power supplies, which are connected in parallel, the relative contribution of each power supply to the load may thus be governed.<br>
[000432] In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, under changed operating conditions; the controller functionality may prescribe a different sharing, such as that illustrated in line 1998 of Fig. 26B and 26C5 wherein the first power supply contributes 50% of its total output power, as illustrated by line 1998 of Fig. 26B, and the second power supply contributes 60 percent of its total output power, as illustrated by line 1998 of Fig. 26C.<br><br>

In addition, PSC controller 1928 communicates via data portion 1520 to communicate via the data portion of bi-directional power bus 1210 with power pooling controller 1230 (Fig. 17, 18A, 18B, 19A and 19B), Temperature sensor 1750 is operative to detect the operating temperature of internal power supply 1330, thus providing data input useful in preventing early failure of internal power supply 1330. Power supply 1330 having PSC 1340 thus affects desired power sharing in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, being adaptable by commands received from power pooling controller 1230 in real time to various operational modes of the system, and having immediate response to the operation of other nodes through current share bus 1570.<br>
[000439] Fig. 27B illustrates a high level schematic diagram of an embodiment of PSC 1345 of Fig. 24B. The output of power supply 1330 is connected at the input of PSC 1345 to the drain of a transistor 1946. An analog error amplifier 1934 receives a reference voltage via a resistor 1936 from a controllable reference voltage source 1908 and receives in parallel a control signal via a controllable resistor 1926 from an analog comparator 2012. Analog amplifier 1934 also receives a Vout sensing input from a first voltage sensor 1840, which preferably comprises a voltage divider connected at the source of transistor 1946, further acting as the output of PSC 1345. The output of analog amplifier 1934 controls the gate of transistor 1946.<br>
[000440] Analog comparator 2012 receives an input from a current sensor 1580 connected at the output of PSC 1345. A controllable resistor 1926 is interposed between analog comparator 2012 and analog error amplifier 1934 in order to enable control of the voltage/current relationship of PSC 1345. PSC 1345 further comprises an amplifier 2026, which receives an input from current sensor 1580 and<br><br>
outputs a current sharing control signal via a diode 2028 to a current share bus 1570 connected to other PSCs 1340 and 1345 of Figs. 18A, 18B, 19A and 19B. The combination of amplifier 2026 and diode 2028 functions as an ideal diode. Analog comparator 2012 also receives an input from the current sharing.bus 1570.<br>
[000441] PSC 1345 further comprises a PSC controller 1928 which receives inputs from a second voltage sensor 1840 connected at the output of PSC 1345, current sensor 1580 and a temperature sensor 1750. PSC controller 1928 provides a control signal output to controllable resistor 1926 and a control signal to controllable reference voltage source 1908. In addition, PSC controller 1928 communicates via data portion 1520 of the internal bus and the data portion of bi¬directional power bus 1210 with power pooling controller 1230 (Fig. 175 18A, 18B, 19A and 19B). Temperature sensor 1750 is operative to detect the operating temperature of internal power supply 1330, thus providing data input useful in preventing early failure of internal power supply 1330. PSC 1345 thus affects desired power sharing in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, being adaptable by commands received from power pooling controller 1230 in real time to various operational modes of the system, and having immediate response to the operation of other nodes through current share bus 1570.<br>
[000442] Fig. 27C illustrates a high power conversion efficiency alternative to the circuitry of Fig. 27B, thus illustrating a high level schematic diagram of an alternative embodiment of PSC 1345 of Fig. 24B. Pulse width modulation or resonance controller 1760, generally power supply controller 1760 comprises a saw tooth generator 1900 which outputs to an analog comparator 1902, which comparator also receives an input from an analog error amplifier 1904.

[000443] The output of analog comparator 1902 generates a pulse-width modulated signal which is supplied to a gate of transistor 1960 which modulates the voltage output of power supply 1330 connected to the drain of transistor 1960, and provides a voltage modulated output to induction coil 1964, which outputs via rectifier 1966 and DC output filter 1968 which are implemented connected between<br><br>
the input and output ends, respectively, of induction coil 1964 and ground.   The output end of induction coil 1964 further serves as the output of PSC 1345.<br>
[000444] Analog comparator 2012 receives an input from a current sensor 1580 connected at the output of PSC 1345. PSC 1345 further comprises an amplifier 2026, which receives an input from current sensor 1580 and outputs a current sharing control signal via a diode 2028 to a current share bus 1570 connected to other PSCs 1340 and 1345 of Figs. 18A, 18B, 19Aand 19B.

PSC controller 1928 provides a control signal output to controllable resistor 1926 and a control signal to controllable reference voltage source 1908. In addition, PSC controUer 1928 communicates via data portion 1520 and the data portion of bi-directional power bus 1210 from power pooling controller 1230 (Fig. 17, 18A, 18B, 19A and 19B). Temperature sensor 1750 is operative to detect the operating temperature of internal power supply 1330, thus providing data input useful in preventing early failure of internal power supply 1330. PSC 1345 thus affects desired power sharing in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, being adaptable by commands received from power pooling controller 1230 in real time to various operational modes of the system, and having immediate response to the operation of other nodes through current share bus 1570.<br>
[000446] Fig. 27D illustrates a high level block diagram of an embodiment of controller 1928 (Figs. 25A - 25C, Figs. 27A - 27C). As seen in Fig. 27D, controller 1928 preferably comprises an internal communication bus 1650, which provides communication between a communication interface 1660, which in turn communicates with the data portion of internal bus 1520, a memory 1670, which in a preferred embodiment is a non-volatile memory operable to retain a history of operating parameters, and acceptable operating ranges, control logic 1680 and a control line interface 2090 which is operative to connect to controllable reference voltage 1908, controllable resistor 1926 as well as connect to current sensor 1580, voltage sensor 1840 and temperature sensor 1750.<br>
[000447] Reference is now made to Figs. 28A, 28B and 28C, which illustrate the voltage/current relationship provided by the embodiments of Figs. 27A -<br><br>
27C. Turning initially to Fig. 28A in which the x-axis represents output current and the y-axis represents output voltage, it is seen that a fixed voltage over a broad range of cunrent is established provided in the embodiments shown in each of Figs. 27A, 27B and 27C. This fixed voltage, as illustrated by line 2050, may be varied by changing the voltage reference to an analog amplifier in each embodiment in response to the sensed output current. Various possible real-time modifications of the voltage current relationship in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention are represented by various lines drawn 2060, 2070 and 2080 shown in Fig. 28A. The present invention enables the relative contributions of the power supplies engaged in current sharing to be modified in real time. This contrasts with conventional current sharing wherein the relative contributions of the power supplies are determined in advance.<br>
[000448] Figs. 28B and 28C illustrates the behavior of two power supplies of the types shown in any of Figs. 27A - 27C, when their output voltages are connected in parallel to a load, in which the x-axis is used to display the different power supplies, and the y-axis represents percentage of available power being supplied being supplied by the power supply. Fig. 28B illustrates an initial operating point, set under command of power pooling controller 1230 operating over the data portion of bi-directional power share bus 1210, in which a first power supply contributes 20% of its total available power, while a second power supply contributes 40% of its total available power. Fig. 28C illustrates a later stage, set under command of power pooling controller 1230 operating over the data portion of bi-directional power share bus 1210, in which the first power supply contributes 40% of its total available power, while a second power supply contributes 20% of its total available power.<br>
[000449] It is to be noted that Figs. 25A - 28C illustrate only a few examples of power sharing modalities in which the present invention is applied. It is appreciated that the present invention is not limited to these two examples and is applicable to any suitable power sharing modality.<br>
[000450] Reference is now made to Fig. 29, which is a simplified high level flow chart illustrating the operation of power pooling controller 1230 of Figs. 17 - 19B. Upon receiving power, power pooling controller 1230 carries out an initialization stage 3000, which is described hereinto below with reference to Fig. 30. If a new node is connected, power pooling controller 1230 carries out stage 3010,<br><br>
which is further detailed hereinto below with reference to Fig. 31. If a node is disconnected, power pooling controller 1230 carries out stage 3020, which is further detailed hereinto below with reference to Fig. 32. If a fault situation arises during operation, power pooling controller 1230 carries out stage 3040, which is further detailed hereinto below with reference of Fig. 33. During normal continuous operation, power pooling controller 1230 carries out stage 3030, which is further detailed hereinto below with reference to Fig. 34.<br>
[000451] Reference is now made to Fig. 30, which is a simplified flow chart illustrating the initialization phase in the operation of power pooling controller 1230 as described above in relation to stage 3000 of Fig. 29. In stage 3100, control logic 1680 of Fig. 21D is initialized. In stage 3110, following initialization of control logic 1680 within power pooling controller 1230, a built in test procedure is run. In stage 3120, communication interface 1660 of Fig. 2 ID is initialized, and the data portion of bi-directional power bus 1210 is initialized. In stage 3130, all SIU 1300 on bi-directional power bus 1210 are set to an initial "off-state" In a preferred embodiment, SIU 1300 is implemented with hardware having an initial off mode, thus initially any nodes connected to bi-directional power bus 1210 operate independently without transmitting power to or receiving power from bi-directional power bus 1210.<br>
[000452] In stage 3140, power pooling controller 1230 then communicates with a first of a plurality of data communication nodes, such as nodes 1102, 1104, 1106, 1108, 1140 and 1240 in Fig. 17. In stage 3150, power pooling controller 1230 interrogates PSC controller 1928 of Figs. 25A - 25C and 27A - 27C. Power pooling controller 1230 interrogates PSC controller 1928 in order to determine its operational status and its operational parameters. Preferably, PSC controller 1928 comprises local non-volatile memory operable for storage of status, operational parameters, and preferably historical information. Optionally, in stage 3160 the data communication node is assigned a group address, to enable high speed data communication by group's in addition to the nodes specific address on bi-directional power bus 1210.<br>
[000453] In stage 3170 the nodes that have been communicated with are compared with the total number of nodes connected. In the event that additional nodes have not yet been interrogated, in stage 3180 a node counter is incremented and stage 3140 is again implemented.  In the event that in stage 3170 no further nodes<br><br>
were identified that have not been interrogated, in stage 3190 the program returns to the main routine as described above in relation to Fig. 29.<br>
[000454] Fig. 31 illustrates a high level flow chart of the operation of power pooling controller 1230 in the event that a new node has been added to the system. 'A new node is detected as being added to the system either as a result of the initialization routine 3000 of Fig. 30, or as a result of normal operation of stage 3030 of Fig. 29, In stage 3300, power pooling controller 1230 evaluates whether it is possible to connect the new node inter alia by comparing power requirements of the new node with power availability in the system. As described above, available power in the system comprises power available from power bus power supply modules 1300, internal power supplies 1330 of power spine module 1122, and any excess power available from attached nodes shareable through SIU 1300, and optionally OPC 1450 by operation of PSC 1340 or PSC 1345 under command of power pooling controller 1230, In a preferred embodiment, power pooling controller 1230 is programmed to maintain a power reserve equal to or greater than the largest single power supply 1330 connected, thus acting as a reserve power supply.<br>
[000455] In the event that in stage 3310 it is deemed that it is not possible to reliably connect the new node, in stage 3330 notification of the fault is sent to both the node over the data portion of bi-directional power bus 1210 and to a connected management station 1040 of Fig. 11-17 over LAN/WAN 1022.<br>
[000456] In the event that in stage 3310 it is deemed that the new node is deemed to be suitable for connection, in stage 3340 the voltage and current on bi¬directional power bus 1210 are noted and in accordance therewith. In stage 3350 parameters of"PSC 1340 or 1345 in the newly added node are set. In stage 3360, PSC 1340 or 1345 of the newly attached node is interrogated to report on current, voltage and optionally temperature parameters, to ensure that compliance with the parameters sent in stage 3340 is within the operational capability of PSC 1340 or 1345. In a preferred embodiment, PSC 1340 or 1345 comprises non-volatile memory, operable to store historical operating parameters. In stage 3360 compliance by the newly attached node as indicated by PSC controller 1928 through the data portion of bi¬directional power bus 1210 is confirmed. In the event that in stage 3360 the operating parameters of the newly attached node are outside of the acceptable range, in stage 3370 a fault condition is indicated, and the fault routine of Fig. 33 is run.<br>
[000457]     In the event that in stage 3360 the operating parameters are<br><br>
confirmed to be within the operating capabilities of PSC 1340, 1345 of the newly<br>
detected node, in stage 3380 the associated SIU 1300 is set in line with the parameters<br>
set in stage 3340 and the new node is powered.  In an exemplary embodiment, SIU<br>
controller 1620 of SIU 1300 is set with- the direction and current limit of the power to<br>
* be shared from or to the newly attached node.<br>
[000458] In stage 3390 voltage and current on bi-directional power bus 1210 under operation of the newly connected node is checked, and the results reported to power pooling controller 1230. In stage 3400 the results reported in stage 3390 are analyzed to ensure proper operation of bi-directional power bus 1210 within acceptable operating parameters. In the event that in stage 3400 bi-directional power bus 1210 operating parameters are not within the acceptable range, in stage 3410 a fault condition is noted, and the fault routine as described in relation to Fig. 33 is run.<br>
[000459] In the event that in stage 3400 the operating parameters of bi¬directional power bus 1210 are within the acceptable range, in stage 3420 normal mode operation as described above in relation to Fig. 29, and as will be described further hereinto below in relation to Fig. 34 is resumed.<br>
[000460] It is to be noted that the successful operation of the flow chart of Fig. 31, enables certain functionality not available to the prior art In particular, as described above, reserve power supply functionality is available based on the overall power supply in the system, without the requirement for a specific dedicated stand-by power supply. Furthermore, add-power functionality, which allows a node to consume more power than is available from its internal power source is enabled. Furthermore, a distributed UPS functionality is enabled from any battery back ug in the system to any node in the system.<br>
[000461] Fig. 32 illustrates a high level flow chart of the operation of power pooling controller 1230 in the event of a disconnection of a node, as described above in relation to stage 3020 of Fig. 29. In stage 3500, the parameters of SIU 1300 associated with the disconnected node are set to off. In a preferred embodiment, SIU controller 1620 of Fig. 21C is addressed to open both first and second controllable switch 1590 so as to ensure that no current slows to/from the disconnected node.<br>
[000462] In stage 3510 current through SIU 1300 is measured. In a preferred embodiment, SIU controller 1620 is polled to read first and second current sensor 1600. In stage 3520 the actual current sensed is compared with zero. In the event that in stage 3520 the current sensed is not zero, in stage 3540 a fault condition<br><br>
is noted, and the fault routine as described above in relation to r^age 3040 of Fig. 29 and as will be described further hereinto below in relation to rig. 33 is run. In the event that in stage 3520 the current is zero, in stage 3530 normal mode operation as described above in relation to Fig. 29, and as will be described further hereinto below in relation to Fig. 34 is resumed.<br>
[000463] Fig. 33 illustrates a high level flow chart of the operation of power pooling controller 1230 in the event of a fault condition being noted, as described above in relation to stage 3040 of Fig. 29. In stage 3600 the fault condition parameters are evaluated, and in stage 3610 the fault condition parameters are compared with predetermined criteria. In the event that the fault condition falls within the predetermined criteria a management report is prepared and transmitted to management station 1040 of Figs. 11-17 over LAN/WAN 1022. In stage 3620, a second set of pre-determined criteria are examined, to determine whether an automatic retry functionality is to be attempted. If an automatic retry is to be attempted, the program returns to the fault calling program vith instructions to retry. In the event that a retry has failed, or in stage 3620 no retry is indicated, in stage 3630 the associated SIU 1300 is shut down. In stage 3640 normal mode operation as described above in relation to Fig. 29, and as will be described further hereinto below in relation to Fig, 34 is resumed.<br>
[000464] Fig. 34 illustrates a high level flow chart of the operation of power pooling controller 1230 in normal mode, as described above in relation to stage 3030 of Fig. 29. In stage 3700, the operating voltage of bi-directional power bus 1210 and the operating voltage of internal bus 1350 of each connected active node is monitored to ensure proper operation within operating parameters. In stage 3710 current and direction of each SIU 1300 is monitored.<br>
[000465] In stage 3720, based on the information obtained in stages 3700 and 3710 the load on each connected power supply is evaluated in real time. Internal power supplies 1330 of attached nodes, any internal power supply 1330 units; power suprjly 1330 of power bus power supply module 1140 and battery pack 1108 are all monitored. In stage 3730, the temperature of all power supply 1330 units are monitored, as indicated by temperature sensor 1750 connected to PSC controller 1928 and transmitter to power pooling controller 1230 of the data portion of bi-directional power bus 1210. In stage 3740 the mains power of each unit is monitored.<br>
[000466]     In stage 3750, the actual load on each of the power supplies<br><br>
connected to the system and available over bi-directional power share bus 1210 is evaluated, and in stage 3760 an optimization algorithm adjusts PSC 1340. 1345 and the associated SIU 1300 accordingly, thus achieving real time adjustment and optimization of all associated power supplies. In a preferred embodiment, the optimization algorithm comprises optimizing load sharing, hea; distribution, battery support time and overall efficiency.<br>
[000467] In stage 3770, any changes sent in stage 3760 to PSC 1340, .1345 are evaluated in real time based on feedback communicated from SIU 1300 and PSC 1340. 1345, In the event that operation is not optimum, stage 3760 is rerun to reoptimize. In stage 3780, a log is kept of all activities and instructions, and selected telemetry comprising selected operating parameters are sent over LAN/WAN 1022 to management station 1040.<br>
[000468] Fig. 35 illustrates a high level flow chart of an addressing system in accordance with the principle of the subject invention. As indicated above, each node is provided with both an address, and a group number. Preferably, multiple nodes are provided with the same group number. In this manner, multiple nodes are addressed over a serial bus rapidly in the event of certain conditions, thus avoiding the need to individually address each node. In one non-limiting embodiment, in the event of a failure of a DC power source in a single node, pooling controller 1230 reacts by sending a group message to a plurality of nodes setting them to an emergency power mode. In one embodiment the emergency power mode comprises a reduced powrer demand from of electrical load of the node, and in another embodiment the reduced power mode comprises an increased power output of the associated DC power source of the node. In one embodiment reduced power demand of the electrical load of the node is accomplished by removing power from low priority loads. Preferably, the node is operable to notify the pooling controller of the failure of the DC power source of the node. In an exemplary embodiment, the use of group addressing allows for a response to a failure event within 10 milliseconds, thus avoiding any damage caused by an interruption in power. In one embodiment a failure is defined as an increase in temperature of a DC power source above a pre-se: limit.<br>
[000469] In stage 3900, a message, comprising an address, is received, and in stage 3910 the address of the message is compared with the node address. In the event that the address matches the node address, in stage 3920 the message is acted upon.   In the event that in stage 3910 the address does not match the node<br><br>
address, in stage 3930 the address is compared to the group address assigned to the node. In the event that in stage 3930 the address matches the group address, in stage 3940 the node acts on the message. In the event that in stage 3930 the address does not match the group address, in stage 3950 the message is discarded. Such a group addressing system allows power pooling controller 1230 to group address a message requiring immediate action by multiple nodes in real time, without requiring individual nodes to be addressed. For example, in the event of a catastrophic power failure in the power supply 1330 of one or more nodes, power pooling controller 1230 may address all nodes in a specific group address to go to a power saving mode, and may address all nodes in a separate group address to maximize their power output. Alternatively, a single group address may be utilized to maximize the power output of some units, and place other units in a reduced power requirement mode, without exceeding the scope of the invention.<br>
[000470]	Thus the present invention provides for a system of power<br>
pooling of DC electrical power consuming and providing entities being interconnected to pool power under control of a pooling controller.<br>
