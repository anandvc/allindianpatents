				<td>Device for filling and locking/closing of containers/receptacles<br>
State of the Art of Technology<br>
The above invention relates to a device for filling and locking/closing of containers in accordance with the generic description of the independent claims. A device according to the generic description of Claim 1 is already known from Patent Document DE-A-103-30 700. The machine for filling and locking of packages/containers disclosed in the document encompasses several processing stations. The processing stations have a robot each, where the robot of each processing station has a robot mechanism of identical design. A processing station for the filling operation works independently from a processing station, through which a locking/closure on a still open side of a syringe is brought on.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
The invention-based device for filling and closing of containers with the characterizing property of Claim 1, in contrast, has the advantage that an immediate locking/closing after the filling operation can take place. For the reason that the filled syringes remain open only for a short time-span, the probability of contaminations gets reduced.     Through the  alteration  of the<br><br>
interval/distance of filling devices and locking/closing devices in transport direction of the containers to be filled, can more over enhance the output.<br>
In a purposeful further development it is intended that a three-axis robot is used as the moving device, for moving the filling equipment/device. Such robots are known for quite some time and have fast processing/operating speeds. As a result of this the output of the plant for filling and closing of containers can be further enhanced.<br>
In a very useful further development it is intended that the transport device is operated with a clocking or timing pulse. The possibility of a variable interval between the filling device and locking device especially for a transport system operated under clocked process represents a further optimization in the context of shorter dwell-time of filled-in containers as well as yield/output capacity. Moreover, the device can be adapted to different processing steps, in that the interval between the filling device and the closing device is chosen adequately so large, that after the filling operation the filled-in containers are to be withdrawn again for purpose of in-process control.<br>
In yet another useful further development, it is intended that the moving devices are triggered/actuated depending upon the speed of the transport device. Thus the containers can be filled and/or locked during the on-going transport.<br>
Another useful further development intends that only the filling device can be moved in the transport direction, while the locking/closing device assumes as opposed to the transporting device a fixed position, and can be moved only in vertical direction for locking operation. Under this chosen constellation the cost of the device can be further optimized; however, the time between filling and closing increases itself, because there is an empty row in-between.<br><br>
Advantageous further design variants of the invention-based device for filling and locking of containers emerge themselves from the dependent Claims and from. the Description.<br>
Drawing<br>
Two design examples of the invention are illustrated in the drawing and are further explained here below. The drawings show:<br>
Figure 1	a perspective view of the invention-based device, in the position "fill<br>
the last row, close the second to last / last but one"<br>
Figure 2        the invention-based device of figure 1 in the position "fill the first<br>
row, lock/close the last row"<br>

Control"<br>
Figure 4	a second design example of the invention-based device, as well as<br>
Figure 5        The View from the Top of the invention-based device of Figure 4.<br>
Description of the Design Example<br>
On a transporting device/system 14 clusters 16 assembled with containers 18 are transported to different processing stations. The open containers 18 are filled through a filling device 10, which adds liquid through filling needles 22 arranged in a row to the containers 18. The filling device 10 can be moved by means of a moving-device 28 at least in transport direction of the transporting device  14, as well as in vertical direction.    As a result of this a variable<br><br>
'interval/distance between the filling needles 22 of the filling device 10 and a locking/closing device 12 is obtained. The locking/closing device 12 comprises at least setting-tubes 24 and plungers 26, with which the filled containers 18 are closed/locked. To this an additional moving device 30 is intended which similarly facilitates the movement of the closing device 12 in transport direction as well as in vertical directions. The same arrangement is shown in Figures 2 and 3, albeit in different positions, as explained below. A centering device is brought in during the processing operations under the respective cluster 16 with the containers 18 in order to hold the containers 18 in a defined and stable position.<br>
The second design example as per figures 4 and 5 differentiates itself from the above, in that the device for movement 30' of the closing device 12 permits merely a movement in vertical direction, not however in the transport direction. A corresponding linear guidance is shown in figure 4. A robot is deployed as the device for movement 28 of the filling device 10, which moves filling needles 22 in transport direction, perpendicular to transport direction as well as in vertical direction.<br>
The invention-based first design example works as follows: There is a continuous transport of the clusters carrying the containers 18 one after the other. Thus there are several clusters 16 with containers 18 in centerings. They are transported one after the other to the processing station. Now simultaneous filling and closing operations take place through the filling device 10 and closing device12. According to the invention the filling needles can now also execute a movement in transport direction. The transport device 14 executes a clocked-process movement, in order always to move the containers 18 precisely under the closing/locking device 12. The movement of the filling needles 22 of the filling device 10 can equalize the recess/offset between the clusters 16. Thus as shown in figure 1, the last row of the first cluster 16 is filled and simultaneously the immediately following row is locked through the locking device 12. The subsequent processing step is illustrated in figure 2. The filling device now<br><br>
'moves itself to the next cluster 16, to fill the next row there. The transporting device 14 moves to one position further in order to lock the next row. For the reason that the interval/distance between filling device 10 and closing device 12 is variably selected, the filling device 10 can already start with the filling of the next cluster 16, resulting in increased output/productivity. The displacement device 30 brings about the locking-movement with the help of setting-tube 24 and plunger 26.<br>
Through the variable position of the filling needles 22, they can also be used for filling containers which are somewhat farther away, in order to subject them to an In-Process Control, as shown in Figure 3. It may be necessary if one were to withdraw again the containers 18 after the filling operation but before the locking operation, for weighing. In stations located immediately one after the other, this is not possible. The device described makes itself ideally suitable for a clocked operation of the transporting device 14. It can however be used also for a continuously running transport-device.<br>
The devices shown in Figures 4 &amp; 5 differentiate themselves only with regard to the displacement device 30 of the closing device 12. This does not facilitate a movement of the closing device 12 in transport direction. The clusters 16 are moved depending on the locking position. The displacement device 28 of the filling device 10 is designed as a robot, which can also undertake movements in transport direction, besides vertical and horizontal movements. Thereby it is possible in principle to achieve the different processing positions illustrated in figures 1 to 3.<br>
For instance vials/syringes are used as containers to be filled.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
