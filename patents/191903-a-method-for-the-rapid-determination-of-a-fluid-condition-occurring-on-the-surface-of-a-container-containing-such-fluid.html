				<td>Introduction<br>
The addition of specialty chemicals to a multitude of industrial processes is<br>
desirable and often required for efficient, profitable, and safe operation of the processes.<br>
The addition of specialty chemical treatments to such processes can help to reduce<br>
process fouling, corrosion, and foaming, among other things. These treatment chemicals<br>
are added to the processes at concentrations ranging from parts-per-billion to percent<br>
levels. The treatment dosage is often determined by monitoring changes in process<br>
parameters that correspond to the addition of the specialty chemical over time.<br>
Optimally, those skilled in the art desire to relate dosage to changes in the process fluids.<br>
However, the means for determining dosage is often very time consuming as vital process<br>
parameters will many times only change meaningfully over a very long time period. For<br>
some processes, the appropriate determination of the correct specialty chemical dosage<br>
can take several months. Once established, these dosages are set to a static value. The<br>
dosage does not increase or decrease as the fouling, corrosion, or foaming rate, for<br>
example, changes over time. This results many times in the addition of a wasteful excess<br>
of specialty chemical or worse, undertreatment with the specialty chemical.<br>
Examples of methods used to control the addition of specialty chemicals include<br>
the use of coupon analyses, off-line residual product testing, residual polymer testing, on-<br>
line pH monitors, conductivity monitors, and the like. However, these methods, and<br>
many others that have been utilized to monitor performance and control dosage are<br><br>
typically slow and not indicative of real-time changes in the process. Residual testing,<br>
for example, typically involves removing a sample fluid from the process and subjecting<br>
the sample for analyses at some site away from the process. Also, in the case of on-line<br>
meters like pH probes and conductivity meters, the detection limit and variance of many<br>
methods is too high to provide accurate data for the control of the addition of specialty<br>
chemicals. That is, the sensitivity of on-line instrumentation is often not high enough to<br>
enable an operator to adjust the dosage of specialty chemical in real-time. Thus, for the<br>
precise and accurate control of the addition of specialty chemicals to industrial processes,<br>
a highly sensitive, in situ method that provides real-time feedback on the state of fluids in<br>
a process is desirable.<br>
The use of quartz crystal microbalances to measure the amount of scaling, deposit<br>
formation or mass loss occurring in both hydrocarbon and aqueous systems is known.<br>
These devices operate by exciting a quartz crystal in contact with fluid (liquid or vapor)<br>
to a resonant frequency and then measuring the shift in resonant frequency due to the loss<br>
or accumulation of mass from/on the crystal surface. While successful in measuring the<br>
mass of deposits of hard, crystalline scale or foulant, we have found that traditional quartz<br>
crystal microbalance units are an unreliable indicator of many types of phenomena that<br>
occur in both aqueous and non-aqueous systems. In the first place, traditional quartz<br>
crystal microbalances do not accurately measure the mass of amorphous deposits formed<br>
from, for instance, biofouling, or the deposits of amorphous hydrocarbons on the surfaces<br><br>
of processing units or the like. Relying on traditional quartz crystal microbalances for<br>
these types of measurements produces inaccurate and unreliable data that cannot be used<br>
to control the feed of chemical used to correct a condition that is being measured.<br>
Examples of the use of typical quartz crystal microbalances for the measurement<br>
of crystalline scale formation in aqueous systems is found in co-pending United States<br>
Patent Application, Serial Number 08/421,206 filed April 13,1995, the disclosure of<br>
which is hereinafter incorporated by reference into this specification. While the device<br>
and methods described in serial number 421,206 operates accurately, and gives excellent<br>
control when only crystalline scale is formed in a system, we have found that this device<br>
does not work in systems where amorphous, or combinations of amorphous and<br>
crystalline scale may form. Further, devices such as that described in serial number<br>
421,206 cannot be used to sense changes that occur in a fluid, such as a viscosity increase<br>
or decrease, density increase or decrease, the presence of an immiscible fluid, or the<br>
growth of an amorphous precipitate forming in the interior of a container containing a<br>
fluid.<br>
Accordingly, this invention utilizes a method for the measurement of the<br>
properties of materials and process streams, and more particularly the measurement of the<br>
viscosity and density of materials, and more particularly to the accurate and rapid<br>
measurement of the viscosity and density of aqueous and non-aqueous fluids as well as<br>
mass deposition. The method of this invention employs a thickness-shear mode resonator<br><br>
device to determine mass accumulation, viscosity, and/or density of hydrocarbon<br>
solutions, vapors, and mixtures as well as mass accumulation, viscosity, and/or density of<br>
aqueous fluids. By the utilization of this method, rapid, precise measurements can be<br>
obtained, instantaneously as well as over time, that can be used to control the addition of<br>
treatment chemicals and process variables in the system. By the use of the thickness-<br>
shear mode resonator device, the processing of crude oils and chemicals can be greatly<br>
improved by the proper and timely addition of antifoulants, by improved emulsion<br>
breaking in both waste water treatment and crude oil demulsification as well as breaking<br>
emulsions formed in the processing of crude oil (e.g., desalting, demulsification, and<br>
certain emulsions that are formed in the processing of hydrocarbons, for instance in<br>
ethylene furnace quench towers), by the proper addition of dispersants or other additives<br>
to hydrocarbons, and by the addition of finished product biocide control chemicals or<br>
stabilizers. Likewise, the thickness-shear mode resonator devices may be used in<br>
aqueous systems to measure the growth and/or deposit of biological, inorganic, or organic<br>
scales, or the devices may be utilized to measure the rate at which corrosion is occurring<br>
in either an aqueous or a hydrocarbon system. Additional uses of the thickness-shear<br>
mode resonator devices are disclosed hereinafter.<br>
Background<br>
Quartz crystal microbalances, also sometimes called piezoelectric sensors, have<br>
been suggested for measuring the mass of matter depositing from a fluid medium,<br><br>
measuring the viscosity of a flowing fluid, determining the rate at which films are<br>
deposited, monitoring corrosion, and the like. While somewhat successful, quartz crystal<br>
microbalances measuring only shifts in resonant frequency often gave erroneous readings<br>
when used in industry under certain conditions. For instance, quartz crystal<br>
microbalances which were excellent at the measurement of hard adherent scale which<br>
actually deposited on the crystal and dampened the vibration of the crystal, often did not<br>
give proper results when amorphous or soft scale (biological growth, amorphous<br>
inorganic crystals, and the like) were deposited on the same crystal. This is because the<br>
devices relied only upon measuring shifts in resonant frequency. Therefore, these sensors<br>
would be useless as a means to control the addition of treatment chemicals like biocides<br>
and antipolymerants.<br>
Thickness-shear mode resonators useful in the practice of this invention are<br>
known to those in the art. A particularly useful thickness-shear mode resonator is<br>
disclosed in Granstaff et. al U.S. Patent 5,201.215 the disclosure of which is hereinafter<br>
incorporated by reference into this specification. This device is able to determine the<br>
density-viscosity product of a given fluid. It should be pointed out that the quartz crystal<br>
portion of this thickness-shear mode resonator is substantially identical to the quartz<br>
crystal microbalances of the prior art. It is the manner in which the signal is processed<br>
which renders the use of the Granstaff thickness-shear mode resonators unique, and<br>
which allows these thickness-shear mode resonators to do what typical quartz crystal<br><br>
microbalances cannot do. What differentiates the thickness-shear mode resonators useful<br>
in this invention from quartz crystal microbalances which cannot be utilized to measure<br>
the density-viscosity of a given fluid is the oscillator circuitry. The oscillator circuitry of<br>
the device described in Granstaff '215 provides not only a measure of resonant frequency,<br>
but also a measure of changes in resonant frequency amplitude which is sensitive to the<br>
physical properties of the fluid medium in which the crystal is immersed.<br>
A second type of thickness-shear mode resonator which is useful in the practice<br>
of this invention is disclosed by S. J. Martin et al. in Sensors and Actuators A 44 (1994)<br>
209-218 the disclosure of which is also hereinafter incorporated by reference into this<br>
specification. This type of device utilizes a first sensor having a roughened surface and a<br>
second sensor having a smooth surface. By the use of this device it has been found<br>
possible to simultaneously determine and resolve mass deposition, fluid viscosity and<br>
density. By using both smooth and rough surfaces which respond differently to mass<br>
adhesion, it is possible to differentiate mass deposition and viscosity and density of a<br>
fluid in contact with the piezoelectric crystal of the thickness-shear mode resonator.<br>
As stated in Granstaff' 215. the mass of a solid and/or the physical properties of a<br>
fluid may be determined when both the mass and the fluid contact the same quartz crystal<br>
by applying an oscillating electric field across the thickness of the quartz crystal<br>
microbalance in contact with a solid mass interposed between the quartz crystal<br>
microbalance and a fluid, measuring at least one resonant frequency of the quartz crystal<br><br>
microbalance, simultaneously measuring the admittance magnitude at the resonant<br>
frequencies, and correlating the resonant frequency and the admittance magnitude to<br>
obtain a surface mass density and a fluid viscosity-density product.<br>
Alternatively, and as also taught by Granstaff, an oscillating electric field may be<br>
applied across the thickness of a quartz crystal microbalance, sweeping a frequency over<br>
a range that spans at least one resonant frequency of the crystal, measuring the magnitude<br>
and phase of the admittance over the frequency range, correlating the admittance data to<br>
the frequency, and applying admittance/frequency correlation to an equivalent circuit<br>
model, contacting a solid mass and/or a fluid onto the crystal wherein the solid mass is<br>
interposed between the crystal and the fluid, repeating the steps of sweeping the<br>
frequency range that spans a resonant frequency, measuring the magnitude and phase of<br>
the admittance over that frequency range, and correlating the admittance data to the<br>
frequency and then applying the admittance/frequency correlation to the equivalent<br>
circuit model and then extracting the solid mass and fluid density-viscosity product from<br>
the correlated admittance/frequency data.<br>
While Granstaff et al. discloses that the mass layer may be metals, metal alloys,<br>
salts, some rigid polymers, or ice, and that these solids may be applied to the quartz<br>
crystal microbalance by evaporation, electroplating, precipitation, or other chemical or<br>
thermodynamic reaction, there is no appreciation by Granstaff et al. that the method may<br>
be effectively utilized in the field of hydrocarbon processing or water treatment, or that<br><br>
the devices may be effectively utilized to control the addition of process additives in these<br>
areas.<br>
We have found however that a certain type of quartz crystal microbalance,<br>
substantially as described in Granstaff, can be used to overcome the disadvantages of the<br>
prior art quartz crystal microbalance units, and can supply accurate and instantaneous<br>
data for the control of the feed of chemicals used to control or modify both aqueous and<br>
non-aqueous processes.<br>
It is therefore an embodiment of this invention to provide to the art a method for<br>
the control of chemical additives into hydrocarbon processing and water treatment	<br>
processes through the use of thickness-shear mode resonator devices.	<br>
It is a further embodiment of this invention to provide to the art an accurate and <br>
real-time method for the control of the feed of chemical additives into hydrocarbon <br>
processing and water treatment processes.	<br>
It is a still further embodiment of this invention to provide to the art an accurate;<br>
and real-time method for the control of the feed of condition correcting chemical<br>
additives into hydrocarbon processing and water treatment processes.	<br>
Additional embodiments of this invention will appear hereinafter.	<br>
The Invention<br>
The basic method of this invention involves the use of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator device, installing such device in a location where the quartz crystal surface of<br><br>
the device can be in contact with a fluid which as used herein may be a liquid or vapor<br>
(gas), measuring both a mass and a fluid viscosity-density output, determining the<br>
condition of the system, and adding treatment chemical, or taking such other corrective<br>
action as the mass and fluid viscosity-density outputs dictate. The thickness-shear mode<br>
device may be installed on the surface of a container for such fluid, or may simply be<br>
inserted into the fluid. Where the device is inserted into the fluid on either a temporary or<br>
permanent basis care should be taken to insure that an accurate representation of the fluid<br>
contacts the surface of the quartz crystal. The thickness-shear mode resonator device is<br>
preferably inserted on the surface of a container holding the fluid. The use of the word<br>
container is meant to include piping, tanks, or any other device which contains a fluid.<br>
The invention is applicable to the determination of the properties of both aqueous<br>
and non-aqueous systems. Among the principle uses for this invention are the<br>
determination of scaling, corrosion, and biofouling in aqueous systems, the determination<br>
of organic fouling and corrosion in hydrocarbon processes, and determination of the rate<br>
of break of both water-in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions, the determination of fluid<br>
characteristics such as viscosity, density, percent solids, and the like, the amount of<br>
sedimentation occurring in a tank or vessel and the rate at which such sedimentation<br>
occurs. As stated, these are only some of the applications of the invention in the fields of<br>
water treatment and hydrocarbon processing.<br><br>
By the use of the term water treatment herein is meant the prevention of inorganic<br>
scale, corrosion, and biofouling on the surfaces in contact with a water supply or<br>
industrial water system. The invention as stated above is particularly useful in the<br>
determination of the rate of biological growth occurring in an aqueous system. Also<br>
included in the term water treatment as used herein is the separation of solids from fluids,<br>
either vapor or liquid, using either chemical and/or mechanical means, and the separation<br>
of oil from water, again, using either chemical and/or physical means. As used herein the<br>
term hydrocarbon processing means the transport of crude oil by pipeline, rail, barge, or<br>
tanker, and the processing of this crude oil into useful products by various means<br>
including desalting processes, distillation, cracking, and other means to produce salable<br>
products, as well as the further treatment of such hydrocarbon products in the chemical<br>
processing industries including the production of such valuable materials as styrene,<br>
butadiene, isoprene, vinyl chloride, ethylene, propylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, alkyl<br>
acrylates, and the resultant polymeric materials formed from such materials. In practice,<br>
the subject invention may be employed in any situation where it is desired to know the<br>
rate at which organic foulants are formed on the surfaces of heat transfer equipment, flow<br>
lines, storage tanks, and the like. The thickness-shear mode resonator may be installed to<br>
achieve the method of the subject invention at any location in a process where organic<br>
fouling, inorganic scaling, corrosion, or microbiological growth can be expected, or<br>
where a change in the characteristics of a fluid may indicate a processing problem which<br><br>
can be corrected through the addition of a chemical treatment. Likewise the subject<br>
invention can be utilized to determine the rate at which emulsions can be broken, or the<br>
condition of an emulsion in real time so as to allow the feeding of an appropriate<br>
emulsion breaking (or conversely, if an emulsion is the desired product, an emulsifier)<br>
material. Because the use of this invention allows for real-time data, control over scaling,<br>
fouling, microbiological growth and the like is rapidly and accurately achieved in an<br>
unprecedented manner. The inventors herein know of no other technique that can<br>
simultaneously provide instantaneous, real-time mass deposition and fluid property data<br>
to control the feed of water treatment chemicals and/or hydrocarbon processing treatment<br>
chemicals.<br>
In one of its broadest senses, the invention is a method for the determination of a<br>
fluid condition occurring on the surface of a container containing such fluid, and<br>
instantaneously or subsequently taking steps to correct such condition which method<br>
comprises the steps of:<br>
A.	placing a thickness-shear mode resonator device into the container, and placing<br>
the quartz surface of the thickness-shear mode resonator device into contact with<br>
the fluid;<br>
B.	continuously exciting the thickness-shear mode resonator device and measuring<br>
the frequency shift and damping voltage components of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator device output;<br><br>
C.	continuously determining the condition of the surface of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator device based on the frequency shift and damping voltage components;<br>
and then,<br>
D.	continuously correcting the condition detected on the surface of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator device by taking an action from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
i.	activating or deactivating a chemical feed pump applying a condition<br>
correcting chemical to the fluid;<br>
ii. increasing the flow of fluid out of the system; or,<br>
iii. decreasing the flow of fluid out of the system.<br>
While the frequency shift and damping voltage components which are the output<br>
of the thickness-shear mode resonator can be used directly, it is oftentimes useful to<br>
convert this data to mass and a viscosity-density component. As stated above, the<br>
thickness- shear mode resonator device may be placed adjacent to the surface of the<br>
container holding the fluid or may be inserted into the container in any location where the<br>
fluid contained in the container is in contact with the quartz crystal surface of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator device. The container utilized may be advantageously<br>
selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon processing units, hydrocarbon storage<br>
tanks, pipelines, or transport vessels such as barges, ships, and railcars.<br><br>
Additionally, while the thickness-shear mode resonator device of the invention<br>
may be placed into the system on a permanent basis, it is also possible to place such a<br>
device into a system on a temporary basis to determine whether a fluid condition<br>
correcting chemical should be added.<br>
While useful in the correction of a condition on a surface in contact with a fluid,<br>
the invention may also be utilized to control a condition of the fluid itself in either a<br>
liquid or gaseous state, and regulate a condition of the fluid such as consistency,<br>
viscosity, and the like. In one of its broadest senses, the invention involves the<br>
determination of a fluid condition in a fluid manufacturing process, including the storage<br>
or transport of said fluid, and instantaneously taking steps to correct such condition which<br>
steps comprise:<br>
A.	inserting into the container containing said fluid a thickness-shear mode resonator<br>
device whereby the quartz surface of the thickness-shear mode resonator device is<br>
in contact with the fluid;<br>
B.	continuously exciting the thickness-shear mode resonator device and measuring<br>
the frequency shift and damping voltage components of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator device output;<br>
C.	continuously determining the condition of the surface of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator device based on the frequency shift and damping voltage components;<br>
and then,<br><br>
D. continuously correcting the condition detected on the surface of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator device by taking an action from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
i.	activating or deactivating a chemical feed pump applying a condition<br>
correcting chemical to the fluid;<br>
ii. increasing the flow of fluid out of the system; or,<br>
iii. decreasing the flow of fluid out of the system.<br>
To state the invention in another manner, the basic invention of this application<br>
operates in a water treatment system by using the following steps:<br>
A.	inserting into the water, preferably on the surface the container containing such<br>
water, a thickness-shear mode resonator device whereby the quartz surface of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator is in contact with the industrial water;<br>
B.	continuously exciting the thickness-shear mode resonator device and measuring<br>
the mass and viscosity-density components of the thickness-shear mode resonator<br>
device output;<br>
C.	continuously determining the condition on the surface of the thickness-shear<br>
mode resonator device based on the mass and viscosity-density components; and<br>
then,<br>
D.	continuously correcting the condition detected on the surface of the thickness-<br>
shear mode resonator device by taking an action from the group consisting of:<br><br>
i.	activating or deactivating a chemical feed pump applying a condition<br>
correcting chemical to the industrial water system;<br>
ii. increasing the flow of water out of the system; or,<br>
iii. decreasing the flow of water out of the system.<br>
While in the above description the term thickness-shear mode resonator device<br>
has been used in the singular form it is often times desirable to use more than one<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator device in a given system. As such, the singular form of<br>
the term thickness-shear mode resonator is used herein to include herein one, two, or<br>
multiple thickness-shear mode resonator devices. This allows for additional control of<br>
the system. The use of multiple thickness-shear mode resonator devices is especially<br>
important when the devices are used to determine sediment in a tank, emulsion breaking<br>
efficiency, the level of foam in a vessel, the level of each of two or more distinct phases<br>
in a container, and the like.<br>
The use of this invention allows for the real-time determination of parameters<br>
which effect the aqueous system. By the use of this method, scale formation, corrosion,<br>
or biological fouling can be detected long before such scale, corrosion, or biological<br>
fouling can be visually detected in the system, and long before other methods of<br>
measurement would provide the same information. Because of the sensitivity of<br>
thickness-shear mode resonators, problems occurring in the system are detected much<br>
earlier than with traditional methods, and corrective action through the use of appropriate<br><br>
scale or corrosion inhibitors or microbiocides can be initiated immediately to control the<br>
problem. Through the rapid control of the system by the methods of this invention,<br>
superior control of industrial systems can be achieved. By the use of the thickness-shear<br>
mode resonator devices in the subject method, exacting control of aqueous water<br>
treatment systems can be accomplished. The thickness-shear mode resonator also<br>
operates in real-time which avoids problems with basing chemical feed on coupon<br>
analyses which are composite (integrated over time) sampling. This type of monitoring<br>
does not indicate upset conditions as they occur.<br>
In a non-aqueous system, for example a hydrocarbon processing unit, the<br>
invention could, on a real-time basis determine a fouling, corrosion and/or biological<br>
growth condition occurring on the surface of a hydrocarbon processing unit in contact<br>
with the hydrocarbon fluid (either a liquid or gas) contained in the hydrocarbon<br>
processing unit, and steps could instantaneously be taken to correct such condition.<br>
These steps include:<br>
A.	placing a thickness-shear mode resonator device into the fluid contained in the<br>
hydrocarbon processing unit, whereby the quartz surface of the thickness-shear<br>
mode resonator is in contact with the hydrocarbon;<br>
B.	continuously exciting the thickness-shear mode resonator device and measuring<br>
mass and viscosity-density components;<br><br>
C.	continuously determining the condition of the surface of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator based on the mass and viscosity-density components; and then,<br>
D.	continuously correcting the condition detected on the surface of the thickness-<br>
shear mode resonator by activating or deactivating a chemical feed pump applying<br>
a condition correcting chemical to the hydrocarbon processing unit.<br>
Again, because of the sensitivity of the subject method, fouling and scaling can be<br>
detected at extremely low levels, and corrective action taken instantaneously, and<br>
therefore before major problems occur. As stated above, while the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator device is preferably placed on the surface of the hydrocarbon processing unit so<br>
that the quartz crystal of the thickness-shear mode resonator is in contact with the fluid, in<br>
this inventions broadest sense, it is only important that the quartz crystal surface of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator device be in contact with the fluid to be measured.<br>
Through the use of the method of the invention it would be expected that major problems<br>
like the deposition of asphaltenes on the surface of a heat transfer device in a refinery<br>
could be noted before they became serious or even life threatening such as the occurrence<br>
of a runaway, exothermic polymerization in a monomer storage tank. It is noted that<br>
these are examples of the method of the invention only, and those skilled in the art of<br>
hydrocarbon processing, both in the production and treatment of crude oil, refining, and<br>
the production of petrochemicals will readily see other areas in which this invention can<br>
be utilized. The hydrocarbon processing equipment in which the method of this<br><br>
invention is applicable include almost any equipment processing a crude oil, or distillate<br>
to manufacture fuels, or petrochemical products. The equipment may be a compressor,<br>
reboiler, heat exchanger, purification column, hold vessel, or reactor. Likewise the<br>
invention is applicable to almost any hydrocarbon processing unit including those<br>
processing alkenes and alkynes (e.g. ethylene, propylene, styrene, acrylonitrile, acrylic<br>
acid, alkyl acrylates, vinyl chloride, butadiene, and isoprene) as well as downstream units<br>
that further process the alkenes and alkynes. Chemical additives that may be controlled<br>
include scale and corrosion inhibitors, antifoulants, antifoams, antipolymerants, and the<br>
like. It will be readily apparent that this invention is not limited to any specific type of<br>
specialty chemical additive to any particular process.<br>
The invention may also be used to determine the viscosity, density or a<br>
viscosity/temperature condition of a hydrocarbon fluid contained in a container and<br>
instantaneously taking steps to correct or modify such condition. Steps used include:<br>
A.	inserting a thickness-shear mode resonator into the container holding such<br>
hydrocarbon whereby the quartz surface of the thickness-shear mode resonator<br>
device is in contact with the hydrocarbon;<br>
B.	continuously exciting the thickness-shear mode resonator device and measuring<br>
mass and viscosity-density components;<br>
C.	continuously determining the condition of the hydrocarbon fluid based on the<br>
mass and viscosity-density components; and then,<br><br>
D. continuously correcting the condition of the hydrocarbon fluid by activating or<br>
deactivating a chemical feed pump applying a condition correcting chemical to<br>
hydrocarbon fluid contained in said container.<br>
This process is useful, for example, in the processing of diesel fuels or other fuel<br>
which requires the addition of a pour point depressant to maintain adequate fluidity, or<br>
such other additive such as a viscosity index improper, or other additive which changes<br>
the characteristic of the hydrocarbon fluid. Likewise, as in aqueous systems, the<br>
invention may also be useful for detecting the occurrence and level of foaming in a<br>
process, and may be useful in the introduction of anti-foams into a processing system.<br>
The invention may also be useful in the application of emulsion breakers (or<br>
conversely emulsifiers) to oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions such as that produced in<br>
the treatment of slop oil, refinery desalters, waste water treatment, or the like.<br>
In this method typically two or more thickness-shear mode resonator devices of the<br>
invention are placed at varying levels in the vessel in which the emulsion is located. The<br>
differing characteristics of the fluids, generally encompassing two or more immiscible<br>
fluids can be read using the thickness-shear mode resonators and data accumulated on the<br>
status of the emulsion at any particular level in such vessel or tank. Because of the<br>
differing viscosity and density of water, and oil, and any intermediate rag layer, the<br>
progress of emulsion breaking can be followed, and deemulsifier can be added as a result<br>
of mass, viscosity, and density determinations made through the use of the thickness-<br><br>
shear mode resonators. The method for determining the condition of a<br>
hydrocarbon/aqueous fluid mixture and the feed of emulsion breaker to such a system<br>
generally comprises the following steps:<br>
A.	inserting into the container holding or containing the hydrocarbon/aqueous fluid<br>
mixture a thickness-shear mode resonator device whereby the quartz surface of<br>
the thickness-shear mode resonator device is in contact with the<br>
hydrocarbon/aqueous fluid mixture;<br>
B.	continuously exciting the thickness-shear mode resonator device and measuring<br>
mass and viscosity-density components;<br>
C.	continuously determining the condition of the hydrocarbon/aqueous fluid mixture<br>
based on the mass, viscosity and density components; and then,<br>
D.	continuously correcting the condition of the hydrocarbon/aqueous fluid mixture<br>
by activating or deactivating a chemical feed pump applying a condition<br>
correcting chemical to the processing unit containing the hydrocarbon/aqueous<br>
fluid mixture.<br>
While this embodiment can be practiced using only one thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator placed at a level in the container at which it is desired to measure which phase<br>
is present, it is oftentimes useful to utilize two or more thickness-shear mode resonators<br>
located at differing levels of the container or tank to determine the status of the fluid at<br>
each of the measured levels. In a most preferred mode of practicing this embodiment of<br><br>
the invention, at least two devices are employed, one of which is preferably located at a<br>
location to detect the presence of an aqueous phase, and at least one of such devices<br>
positioned at a location to detect the presence of a hydrocarbon phase. An additional<br>
device may be used at a level where the "rag" or surface interface between the two<br>
immiscible fluids occurs. The hydrocarbon/aqueous fluid mixture to be treated is<br>
generally contained in a container selected from the group consisting of crude oil<br>
demulsification vessels, crude oil heater treaters, crude oil desalting units, ethylene<br>
quench water towers, dilution steam generating systems, hydrocarbon storage tanks,<br>
hydrocarbon transport vessels, waste water clarifiers, waste water treatment units, settling<br>
tanks, accumulators, and metal working fluid sump. The use of more than one thickness-<br>
shear mode resonator gives operators of emulsion breaking processes instantaneous, real-<br>
time information on the status of the emulsion and control of the feed of condition<br>
correcting deemulsifier or other chemical to the emulsion. The term mixture as used in<br>
the sense above is meant to include water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions,<br>
emulsion "rag" layers, separated oil layers, and separated water layers, as well as<br>
dispersions of solids in liquids.<br>
While this method has been described as being useful for the breaking of<br>
emulsions, of course the method may also be used in the formation of emulsions. By<br>
using density-viscosity readings obtained by the thickness-shear mode resonator devices,<br>
emulsifying agent can be added to produce an emulsion having desired characteristics.<br><br>
As may be seen, each of the embodiments of the invention described herein takes<br>
advantage of the thickness-shear mode resonator. In the use of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator to determine the quantity of scale, fouling and/or corrosion occurring, the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator is mounted so that the exposed side of the quartz is in<br>
direct contact with the fluid circulating in the system. In designing such systems, it is<br>
important to take into account the fluid turbulence caused by the insertion of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator. Accordingly, when measuring fouling, scaling,<br>
corrosion, or even the viscosity or other characteristic of a fluid, it is often advantageous<br>
to mount the thickness-shear mode resonator flush with the surface of the container or<br>
pipe through which the fluid passes. When a flush mounting is not practical, or where the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator cannot be installed flush with the surface of the container<br>
or pipe through which the fluid passes, those skilled in the art will readily determine the<br>
best location for the thickness-shear mode resonator. In all installations, it is critical that<br>
the exposed portion of the quartz surface of the thickness-shear mode resonator contact<br>
the fluid being measured, or the fluid from which scale or fouling is being deposited.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, a portable thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator could be utilized. In its simplest form, the portable fixture would be easily<br>
inserted into the fluid or head space of a tank, drum, or open vessel.<br>
The quartz crystal surface of the thickness-shear mode resonator of the invention<br>
can be as small as desired, or as large as practical. Quartz crystal microbalances of the<br><br>
type required to build the thickness-shear mode resonators useful in the practice of the<br>
subject invention are available in various sizes from a variety of commercial sources.<br>
One of the features of this invention is that the thickness-shear mode resonator allows for<br>
the rapid and accurate determination of a condition and the change in a parameter to<br>
control the condition. The invention is usable over a wide variety of pressures and<br>
temperatures. When used at under high pressures, it is preferred that both sides of the<br>
quartz crystal be pressure equalized. When only one side of the crystal is subjected to<br>
high pressure, distortion of the crystal may take place causing inaccurate readings.<br>
Likewise, the invention is useful over a wide range of temperatures ranging from<br>
substantially below freezing to as high as the melting point of the electrical connections<br>
used to receive the signal from the quartz crystal. As such, while the device is not<br>
directly useful in the pyrolysis section of for instance an ethylene furnace, the device is<br>
usable at points exiting the furnace.<br>
Among the many uses of the thickness-shear mode resonator is when such device<br>
controls the addition of a specialty chemical material which is designed to ameliorate or<br>
otherwise moderate a condition, for example the turning on or off of a pump containing<br>
microbiocide, corrosion inhibitor, scale inhibitor, fouling inhibitor, or the like. Methods<br>
for the development of circuits controlling pumps using the output of the thickness-shear<br>
mode resonator device are well known in the art. Such circuits use the signal, after the<br>
determination through calibration of a desired signal level from the thickness-shear mode<br><br>
resonance device, to drive such pump means. In addition to driving a pump means, the<br>
signal can also be utilized to open or close blow-down valves in the case of a cooling<br>
water or boiler water system, or to increase or decrease the flow of a hydrocarbon fluid<br>
passing through a given system, increase or decrease the residence time of an emulsion<br>
contained within a vessel that is necessary for breaking such emulsion, or the like.<br>
In the operation of the thickness-shear mode resonators useful in the subject<br>
invention, an oscillator circuit is utilized to maintain a constant potential across a<br>
piezoelectric crystal (quartz crystal) to provide stable oscillations. The output is<br>
measured and processed in accordance with the general principles elucidated in U.S.<br>
5,201,215 previously incorporated by reference herein.<br>
While it is a current preferred mode of utilizing our invention to use the calculated<br>
mass and viscosity-density results obtained by processing the raw data generated by the<br>
Granstaff device, the "raw-data'" output, frequency shift and damping voltage, obtained<br>
by using the circuitry described in Granstaff, and elsewhere in Wessendorf U.S.<br>
5,416,448, the disclosure of which is hereinafter incorporated by reference into this<br>
specification, is also a measure of the changes occurring on the sensor surface and may<br>
be used directly without conversion to physical property values. This technique may be<br>
especially useful where it is difficult to obtain accurate mass or fluid property results. In<br>
those applications, the chemical additive could be controlled by empirical observation of<br>
the frequency and/or voltage output.<br><br>
This raw data is also of course a measurement of the viscosity-density and mass<br>
components of the fluid in contact with the piezoelectric device, and our invention<br>
encompasses the control of specialty chemical processes using either the raw frequency<br>
shift and voltage data, or the viscosity-density and mass components calculated from the<br>
raw data.<br>
Examples<br>
Acrylonitrile is typically recovered from the gaseous effluent of catalytic reactors<br>
by extraction with water in a column typically known as an absorber. Hydrogen cyanide<br>
and acrylonitrile are selectively extracted from the effluent and this mixture is boiled<br>
overhead in a recovery column to a set of towers where the acrylonitrile is isolated as a<br>
pure component by a series of distillations. Residual organics in the flow from the<br>
bottom of the recovery column are removed by distillation in the stripper column and<br>
most of the remaining water is sent back to the absorber in this cyclic recovery process.<br>
Efficient operation of the recovery process is limited by fouling that occurs in the<br>
process, especially on heat transfer equipment like reboilers, heat exchangers and<br>
distillation towers. This problem can be alleviated by the addition of commercially<br>
available specialty chemical antifoulants. Application of antifoulant material to the<br>
process at dosages from .001-1000 ppm may significantly slow the rate of process fouling<br>
and subsequently extend unit run lengths, reducing the number of periodic equipment<br>
cleanings, and increase unit throughput. The application rates of antifoulant to units of<br><br>
this type are now based on laboratory testing, or empirical data on the number of days a<br>
unit can be left on-line with a given antifoulant dosage. In actual practice, if the heat<br>
exchanger run length is too short because of the existence of fouling, antifoulant dosage<br>
is increased until an acceptable run length is obtained, or no fouling is evident. This<br>
process often leads to the overdose of antifoulant because the antifoulant dosage is<br>
maximized for the worst possible condition and is not based on actual fouling conditions<br>
in the unit. There exists no in situ, on-line, real-time method to determine optimum<br>
dosage of antifoulant.<br>
In order to monitor the dosage of antifoulant, a quartz crystal sensor of the type<br>
described herein would be installed in critical locations in the acrylonitrile purification<br>
process. Typical locations at which thickness-shear mode resonators would be installed<br>
would include the solvent water stream just prior to a heat exchanger. This sensor would<br>
be installed so as to protrude into the solvent water stream. The crystal would be driven<br>
by an oscillator circuit on the outside pipewall. Oscillator and crystal would be<br>
connected via a hermetic rf circuit on the outside pipewall. The oscillator would provide<br>
a frequency and an amplitude output. Changes in resonant frequency would be indicative<br>
of changes in mass on the crystal surface and/or changes in fluid properties. Changes in<br>
amplitude are reflective of crystal damping. The measurements of crystal damping could<br>
be an especially useful measurement because damping is affected by the viscoelastic<br>
nature of the deposit, and the deposits in an acrylonitrile process can be highly<br><br>
viscoelastic. Viscoelastic deposits in the acrylonitrile process would preclude the use of<br>
other quartz crystal microbalance sensors that fail to account for the influence of<br>
viscoelastic properties. Damping is also important to resolve changes in mass from<br>
changes in fluid properties since resonant frequency is sensitive to each. Traditional<br>
quartz resonator sensors would not satisfy this requirement since these devices are<br>
sensitive to changes in resonant frequency only. The sensor used herein is useful in<br>
controlling the process because the associated oscillator circuit is sensitive to changes in<br>
resonant frequency and changes in amplitude (damping voltage).<br>
In the sensor placed in the solvent water line, oscillator output would be measured<br>
by a frequency meter and a voltmeter that were each connected to a personal computer.<br>
Other measurements collected would include time and temperature. Using output from<br>
the oscillator, the computer would be used to calculate and plot the rate of mass<br>
accumulation on the crystal surface. This rate would then be determined prior to the<br>
injection of antifoulant to the process, and the deposition rate in the untreated solvent<br>
water would be proportional to the rate of fouling in the heat exchanger. This rate would<br>
be continually monitored over time as antifoulant was injected into the system. The<br>
antifoulant dosage would then be adjusted until the rate began to change. This would be<br>
manifested on the computer by a change in slope for the line that results from a plot of<br>
deposited mass versus time. Eventually the antifoulant dosage could be slowly adjusted<br>
until the slope of this line approached zero (no detectable deposition over a given time<br><br>
interval) to obtain an optimized antifoulant dosage. The optimized dosage would be<br>
established by actual real-time measurement rather than indiscriminate variables that are<br>
easily affected by other process parameters. At any time during the run, if deposition<br>
increased, the antifoulant rate would be increased to compensate for the higher fouling<br>
rate.<br>
As an alternative to placing the thickness-shear mode resonator in the solvent<br>
water stream, a small slip stream taken from the acrylonitrile recovery process could be<br>
utilized. In some cases it would be expected that overall deposition of solids in the bulk<br>
solvent water would overwhelm the thickness-shear mode resonators. To attenuate large<br>
flow rates and fouling rates, a small flow of solvent water would be diverted to a flow cell<br>
containing the thickness-shear mode resonator. Deposition of solids from the slip stream<br>
would be proportional to deposition from the bulk solvent water provided that process<br>
parameters like temperature and pressure were maintained at constant levels. To facilitate<br>
these conditions, the flow cell may be heated by means such as heater rods, heat tape,<br>
steam, or other conventional means. Furthermore, the addition of a back pressure<br>
regulator to the slip stream line to maintain a constant pressure could also be useful. In<br>
this case, the thickness-shear mode resonator in the flow cell would be attached to an<br>
oscillator circuit outside of the flow cell and slip stream tubing. The oscillator output<br>
would be used as above to calculate the deposition rate and optimize antifoulant feed.<br><br>
As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, a microprocessor could be<br>
substituted for components like the voltmeter and frequency meter. The microprocessor<br>
would make the devices more convenient to work with and would allow the use of data<br>
loggers and laptop computers. Output of the microprocessor in this case would be<br>
interfaced with the laptop computer or datalogger. In yet another possible variation, the<br>
computer would be used to automatically control the pumpstroke on a pump adding<br>
antifoulant to the acrylonitrile process. The computer would be programmed to adjust<br>
pumpstroke by a certain degree for a proportional change in the rate of solid deposition<br>
on the crystal surface. When the fouling rate drops to zero, the computer would direct the<br>
pump to hold constant at its present pumpstroke or to reduce pumpstroke by a certain<br>
percentage. In this manner, chemical antifoulant dosage would be automatically<br>
optimized.<br>
The thickness-shear mode resonator would also be useful in the control of<br>
antifoulants to other hydrocarbon processing operations. As a further example, this<br>
hypothetical example discloses the use of the thickness-shear mode resonator to control<br>
antifoulant addition to the caustic wash system of an ethylene plant.<br>
In an ethylene plant so called acid gases like carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide<br>
are removed from the hydrocarbon mixture by washing the gaseous hydrocarbon with an<br>
aqueous caustic solution. This is normally done at a location in the process called a<br>
caustic tower. The caustic tower is prone to fouling due to the base catalyzed<br><br>
polymerization of reactive aldehydes like acetaldehyde. Fouling in the caustic tower and<br>
associated equipment can be controlled by the application of commercially available<br>
antifoulants. In most situations, there is no convenient manner of determining the<br>
optimum dosage of antifoulant required to reduce fouling to an acceptable level or to<br>
eliminate fouling. In some instances which have not been satisfactory, attempts have<br>
been made to set antifoulant dosage based on the amount of acetaldehyde that is fed to the<br>
caustic tower. In one possible configuration, the thickness-shear mode resonator would<br>
be installed in the tower bottom fluids. Detection of solids in the tower bottoms would be<br>
indicative of the amount of foulant formed during washing of the hydrocarbon gas.<br>
Response from the sensors would be used to set the optimum dosage of caustic tower<br>
antifoulant required to eliminate fouling in the caustic tower. The detection of little, or<br>
no solids in the flow from the tower bottoms would determine the optimum antifoulant<br>
dosage.<br>
The hypothetical examples below describe the use of the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator to control fouling in the processing of light hydrocarbon streams.<br>
During the recovery of light hydrocarbons in ethylene plants, butadiene plants,<br>
isoprene plants and the like, distillation towers and associated equipment like heat<br>
exchangers and reboilers are fouled by the thermal and/or oxidative polymerization of<br>
reactive olefins like butadiene. By placing the thickness-shear mode resonator devices<br>
useful in this invention into the vapor space, beneath select trays in the tower, the probes<br><br>
could be used to detect the formation of foulant from the vapor phase. Traditionally this<br>
is a very difficult problem to detect until the polymeric foulant, often called "popcorn<br>
polymer", has damaged hardware within the tower. Popcorn polymer grows from the<br>
vapor phase on the metal surfaces in the tower. Thickness-shear mode resonators may be<br>
placed in the vapor space of towers such as primary fractionators, depropanizers,<br>
debutanizers, and butadiene purification columns. The thickness-shear mode resonators<br>
would be sensitive to the formation of viscoelastic polymer in the vapor phase which<br>
would deposit on the resonators. The deposition of a thin, viscoelastic film of foulant<br>
would be detectable using the oscillator circuitry described above. If formation of foulant<br>
on the crystal was detected, then the dosage of vapor phase antifoulant could be adjusted<br>
accordingly. In this way, the exact amount of antifoulant required to control vapor phase<br>
fouling could be determined.<br>
Hydrocarbon recovery towers also foul in the liquid and gaseous phases. Placing<br>
the thickness-shear mode resonators described above into the liquid tower bottoms would<br>
help to detect solids that deposit in the tower bottoms and in associated reboilers. These<br>
sensors could be used to control the amount of antifoulant that is added to the tower<br>
bottoms and to the reboilers. These additives are usually different from those added to<br>
control vapor phase fouling although the foulant is usually similar, a viscoelastic polymer<br>
that is insoluble in the liquid hydrocarbon.<br><br>
Sometimes foulant is brought into a tower from another source. Consider the<br>
addition of pyrolysis gasoline to a primary fractionator. In some cases, spent caustic is<br>
washed with pyrolysis gasoline to remove benzene from the spent caustic prior to<br>
disposal of the spent caustic. After the pyrolysis gasoline is separated from the caustic,<br>
the pyrolysis gasoline is sometimes used as reflux in the primary fractionator. During the<br>
washing of the spent caustic, aldol polymer is formed by the caustic-catalyzed<br>
polymerization of phenylacetaldehyde and other reactive carbonyl species in the pyrolysis<br>
gasoline. Any soluble gum formed in this process is carried to the primary fractionator,<br>
where some of the gum precipitates onto hardware within the primary fractionator.<br>
Accumulation of gum in the primary fractionator would lead to a fouled tower. Pyrolysis<br>
gasoline from benzene strippers have been found to contain as much as 1 gram of gum<br>
per 100 mL gasoline. Commercially available dispersants can be added to the gasoline to<br>
help control the deposition of the gum in the primary fractionator. The placement of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator devices of the subject invention in the process lines<br>
returning reflux to the tower could be used as an indication of the amount of gum in the<br>
pyrolysis gasoline reflux. Response from the sensors could be used to determine the<br>
appropriate dosage of antifoulant required to keep gum dispersed in the tower. Not only<br>
would the sensors respond to the deposition of gum onto the crystal surface, but they<br>
would also respond to the changes in viscosity of the pyrolysis gasoline due to higher or<br>
lower concentrations of soluble gum in the liquid.<br><br>
As stated above, the thickness-shear mode resonator can be used for monitoring<br>
the growth of biofiim or "soft" deposits which cannot be measured using previously<br>
known quartz crystal microbalance devices. Among the applications in aqueous systems<br>
that can be monitored using the thickness-shear mode resonator include pulp and paper<br>
processes where microbiological growth presents a problem, cooling water systems<br>
where bacteria and algae growth can present significant problems and certain waste<br>
treatment systems. The invention may also represent an improved method in waste water<br>
emulsion breaking, the separation of an oil phase from a water phase, and other systems<br>
in which the different densities of liquids can be detected by the thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator device. Because the thickness-shear mode resonator device can simultaneously<br>
measure mass loading and fluid property changes such as density and viscosity in contrast<br>
to the earlier known device circuits, side stream sampling using the thickness-shear mode<br>
devices can be accurately used to monitor a microbiological fouling event in real time.<br>
The output of the thickness-shear mode resonator is directly related to the growth of the<br>
biofilm and may be used to control a chemical feed pump. Appropriate control<br>
algorithms may be developed which will ensure that the film growth rate remains within<br>
acceptable limits. Without thickness-shear mode resonance devices, coupon sampling is<br>
the only direct measurement technique available. Coupon sampling, however, requires<br>
obtaining a composite sample over a period of time and does not report system upsets as<br><br>
they occur. Real-time monitoring afforded by the thickness-shear mode resonator will<br>
enable these upsets to be rapidly controlled by changing the chemical treatment dosage.<br>
Likewise, within a cooling tower, there is simultaneous mineral scale deposition<br>
and micro-biological fouling. The ability to measure and to differentiate these two modes<br>
of fouling would enable a cooling tower treatment program to be optimized. The<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator described herein, and as set forth in U.S. patent<br>
5,201,215, describes an instrument that simultaneously measures mass accumulation and<br>
changes in fluid density-viscosity product. The differentiation of these two properties<br>
will allow proper dosing of both anti-scale treatment chemicals and biocide treatments to<br>
be optimized.<br>
The ability to measure sample viscosity on-line would enable real-time<br>
control of the addition of viscosity modifiers for slurries. Viscosity modifiers are added<br>
to slurries used in precious metals processing to reduce energy consumption by pumping<br>
equipment. The method of the present invention would enable on-line control of the<br>
addition of these treatment chemicals using sampling and control techniques described<br>
above.<br>
As an example, a thickness-shear mode resonator would be installed on the wall<br>
of a paper machine in contact with the furnish being used. The thickness-shear mode<br>
resonator would be calibrated to respond to an increase in bioiilm mass occurring on the<br>
surface of its quartz crystal. Upon the deposit of a biofilm onto the surface of the quartz<br><br>
crystal, the thickness-shear mode resonator would send a signal indicative of the build up<br>
of biofilm. This signal would be amplified, and a pump feeding a water soluble<br>
microbiocidal product would be started. The feed of biocide would continue so long as<br>
the mass of deposit would increase, and would stop when the mass of deposit either<br>
decreased or held constant. In similar fashion, the viscoelastic properties of the biofilm<br>
can also be used to monitor biofilm fouling. By using either method, the paper machine<br>
would be kept substantially free of biological growth. Because of the sensitivity of the<br>
thickness-shear mode resonator, the microbiocide would be added at a rate required to<br>
reduce biological growth and reduce over-feeding the chemical. This would result in<br>
reduced chemical consumption.<br>
A thickness-shear mode resonator would be installed on the interior wetted wall of<br>
an industrial cooling tower. The thickness-shear mode resonator would be calibrated to<br>
indicate mass deposition on its surface, and the signal would be amplified and would be<br>
connected to a pump connected to a supply of commercially available industrial<br>
microbiocide. The pump would feed biocide material into the cooling tower. Upon<br>
noting microbiological growth, as evidenced by changes in the mass or viscoelastic<br>
properties of the sample, the thickness-shear mode resonator would send a signal<br>
indicating build up, triggering the pump and initiating the feed of biocide. Upon noting<br>
no further buildup or a decrease in buildup, biocide feed would be terminated. By using<br><br>
the system, a cleaner cooling tower would be obtained, and less biocide would be<br>
consumed and discharged over time.<br>
The examples presented herein are not intended to be all inclusive of all of the<br>
various applications which the sensors of the invention may be employed. Those skilled<br>
in the art will readily determine that in addition to determining the rate of fouling of<br>
hydrocarbon systems and controlling such fouling, the sensors may also be utilized for<br>
such diverse applications as determining the rate at which an emulsion breaks in a<br>
desalter and the resultant real-time control of emulsion breaker feed, the rate at which<br>
microbiocide should be fed to finished products, and the rate at which chemical treatment<br>
should be applied to a hydrocarbon stream to maintain its fluidity and prevent fouling.<br>
