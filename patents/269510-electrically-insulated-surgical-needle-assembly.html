ELECTRICALLY INSULATED SURGICAL NEEDLE ASSEMBLY<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Monitoring of the location of neural elements can reduce the likelihood of<br>
neural damage while accessing anatomical structures near the nerve. Systems exist<br>
which provide for delivery of an electrical current for detection of neural element<br>
proximity to a carrier of the current by visibly noting a patient's limb motor reaction<br>
when the neural element is stimulated by electrical current.<br>
Surgical needle assemblies can be employed for access, treatment and/or<br>
delivery of treatment to locations within a patient's body. The needle assembly is<br>
inserted for penetration of soft and hard tissues of the patient during the initial steps of<br>
the treatment protocol without determining the proximity of neural elements to the<br>
needle assembly during and after such placement of the needle assembly. Subsequent<br>
treatments and procedures that are carried out based on the initial needle insertion<br>
position may impinge or interfere with the neural elements, requiring relocation of the<br>
treatment location or pathway.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present system includes a surgical tool useable by a surgeon to penetrate<br>
soft and hard tissue of the patient with a needle assembly. The needle assembly can<br>
be electrically coupled to a nerve monitoring system to allow the monitoring and<br>
detection of neural elements as the needle assembly is advanced into the patient<br>
through skin and tissue. The distal tip of the needle assembly carries the electrical<br>
signal, and the outer surface of the needle assembly is insulated to prevent shunting of<br>
the signal to tissue or instruments proximal of the distal tip. Corrective action to<br>
avoid impingement or to provide sufficient spacing from neural elements can taken<br>
during needle assembly placement, reducing the likelihood that corrective actions will<br>
need to be taken later in the surgical procedure to avoid or provide sufficient<br>
clearance with neural elements.<br>
In one form, the needle assembly is removably engageable to a handle<br>
assembly that facilitates manipulation and control of the needle assembly as it is<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
2<br>
advanced into the patient. In|one embodiment, the handle assembly is configured to<br>
allow gripping thereof by the hand of the surgeon while maintaining the electrical<br>
lead coupling the needle assembly to the nerve monitoring system out of the way of<br>
the surgeon.<br>
In one procedure, the surgical tool is used in minimally invasive spinal<br>
surgical procedures. The needle assembly is percutaneously advanced into the patient<br>
and engaged to the pedicle of a vertebra. During such engagement, the proximity of<br>
neural elements to the distal tip is monitored to allow for corrective action to be taken<br>
to avoid or provide sufficient spacing of the needle assembly from neural elements<br>
during this initial access phase of the procedure. In one embodiment, when the needle<br>
is engaged to the pedicle at the desired location, the handle assembly is removed from<br>
the needle assembly. The needle assembly includes a cannula housing a stylet, and<br>
the stylet is removed so that the cannula remains engaged to the pedicle. A guidewire<br>
can be positioned through the lumen of the cannula, and the cannula withdrawn. The<br>
guidewire can then guide other instruments, implants or other surgical devices or<br>
instruments to the pedicle. Other procedures are contemplated at locations along the<br>
spinal column other than the pedicles, and at other locations within the body of the<br>
patient other than the spinal column.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
While this device is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there<br>
is shown in the drawings, and will herein be described in detail, several specific<br>
embodiments, with the understanding that the present disclosure can be considered as<br>
an exemplification and is not intended to be limited to the embodiments illustrated.<br>
The present system relates to surgical tools used in accessing locations within<br>
the body of the patient while monitoring the proximity of neural elements to the tool.<br>
In one form, the surgical tool includes a needle assembly electrically engageable to a<br>
nerve monitoring system, where the needle assembly is operable to carry an electrical<br>
signal at its distal tip and allow the surgeon to monitor the proximity of neural<br>
elements with the nerve monitoring system as the needle is advanced to the target<br>
location in the patient. The proximity of the needle assembly to the neural elements<br>
can be controlled to reduce the potential neural element impact of needle insertion and<br>
subsequent procedures carried out based on the needle insertion location. The target<br>
location may include bony structures, an organ, a canal or space, a tumor or other<br>
defect, or any anatomical location or structure within a patient. The needle assembly<br>
includes a structure that facilitates operative positioning and control by the surgeon<br>
during the procedure. Once the needle has been positioned at the target location,<br>
subsequent procedures can be carried out. Such subsequent procedures can include<br>
therapy, implants, substances, or the like provided by, through or upon the needle<br>
assembly. Subsequent procedures may also include using the needle assembly as a<br>
platform or guide for subsequent placement of instruments, implants and other<br>
devices and therapeutic materials.<br>
The needle assembly includes a distal needle structure positionable within the<br>
patient and operable to carry an electrical signal, a handle assembly, and an electrical<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
4<br>
lead. In one embodiment, the needle structure is removably engageable to the handle<br>
assembly, although embodiments where the needle assembly is integral with the<br>
handle assembly are also contemplated. The needle assembly is operable to deliver an<br>
electrical signal, such as a current, to a location in the patient's body to monitor<br>
proximity of the neural elements to the inserted end of the needle structure. The lead<br>
can extend from the handle assembly to an electrical signal source. Another lead can<br>
be used to ground the circuit. The needle assembly, when assembled with the handle<br>
assembly, can be completely insulated, except for the distal insertion end, to prevent<br>
shunting of the electrical signal to tissue or instruments located proximally of the<br>
insertion end.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, there is provided view of a surgical field 24 that<br>
includes a portion of the posterior spinal column shown in hidden lines beneath the<br>
skin and tissue of a patient and surgical tool 20. Surgical field 24 includes spinal<br>
column segment 25 having a number of vertebrae therealong, it being understood that<br>
surgical tool 20 can have application in any region of the spine and in any approach to<br>
the spine. It is also understood that surgical tool 20 has application in procedures<br>
other than spinal surgical procedures.<br>
Surgical tool 20 includes a needle assembly 30 and a handle assembly 80.<br>
Needle assembly 30 is received in a receptacle 86 extending axially into handle<br>
assembly 80. Needle assembly 30 can be electrically coupled to a nerve monitoring<br>
system 22 via lead 100 when positioned in receptacle 86. Lead 100 extends into<br>
handle assembly 80 via a lateral bore 88, where it is electrically coupled to needle<br>
assembly 30. A second reference 27 coupled to a patient (not shown) can be provided<br>
as a ground. In one procedure, the needle assembly 30 is positionable through the<br>
skin and soft and hard tissues of the patient to a surgically appropriate target location<br>
such as, for example, the pedicle of a vertebra of spinal column segment 25.<br>
Subsequent procedures and instruments for accessing the spinal column can then be<br>
employed using the needle assembly and target location obtained thereby as a<br>
minimally invasive platform for treatment and/or placement of devices and implants<br>
to treat conditions associated with the spinal column.<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
5<br>
Needle assembly 30 includes a cannula 40 and stylet 60 removably received in<br>
a central lumen of cannula 40 along a longitudinal axis 38. Stylet 60 may include any<br>
suitable distal tip configuration, such as a trocar tip configuration as shown or a<br>
beveled tip configuration. Other embodiments contemplate a needle assembly that<br>
includes a single needle element. The needle element can be solid or cannulated. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, handle assembly 80 is removably positioned about the<br>
proximal ends of cannula 40 and stylet 60 and engaged thereto to facilitate handling<br>
and positioning of needle assembly 30 through skin and tissue to the target location in<br>
the patient's body. An outer sheath 32 may also be provided for positioning about<br>
cannula 40 and/or stylet 60. Sheath 32 may be provided with a length extending to a<br>
distal end thereof (not shown) that extends distally beyond the distal ends of cannula<br>
40	and/or stylet 60. Sheath 32 can facilitate pre-operative handling of needle<br>
assembly 30 to prevent, for example, accidental punctures, cutting and contamination<br>
of needle assembly 30.<br>
Stylet 60 is shown in isolation in Fig. 4. Stylet 60 includes a pointed tip 62<br>
adjacent its distal end and an elongate shaft 64 extending proximally from tip 62. A<br>
hub 66 is provided at the proximal end of shaft 64. Hub 66 includes an enlarged body<br>
70 extending radially about shaft 64, and a proximal extension 68 extending<br>
proximally from body 70.<br>
Cannula 40 is shown in Figs. 5A and 5B. Cannula 40 includes a central lumen<br>
41	extending therealong and opening at a distal end 42 and a proximal end 53. The<br>
outer surface area of cannula 40 may be covered or coated with a non-conductive or<br>
insulative material or member to prevent shunting of electricity from cannula 40 to<br>
adjacent tissue or instruments. A distal cannula portion 44 extends proximally from<br>
distal end 42 to a transition portion 48. Transition portion 48 extends to a proximal<br>
cannula portion 46. Proximal cannula portion 46 may include a greater outside<br>
diameter than distal cannula portion 44 to provide sufficient rigidity to cannula 40<br>
while minimizing the size of the leading end of cannula 40. Distal end 42 may also be<br>
beveled to facilitate penetration and passage of cannula 40 through skin and tissue to<br>
the target location in the patient. Other embodiments contemplate a single diameter<br>
cannula, or a cannula with more than two diameters.<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
6<br>
The proximal end of cannula 40 includes a connection member 50.<br>
Connection member 50 may be comprised of a non-conductive material, or of a<br>
conductive material having ah insulated coating. Connection member 50 includes a<br>
proximal end fitting 52 configured to facilitate attachment of various devices to<br>
cannula 40. In one embodiment, fitting 52 provides a luer-type connection. Other<br>
embodiments contemplate other connection arrangements that are provided by fitting<br>
52. Connection member 50 may further includes a distal sleeve portion 54 extending<br>
about proximal cannula portion 46. Distal sleeve portion 54 overlaps the insulated<br>
surface area of cannula portion 46 to ensure the cannula 40 is entirely insulated<br>
adjacent its proximal end.<br>
Connection member 50 also includes a gripping portion 56 with opposite,<br>
laterally extending wings and concave surface depressions that allow the user to grip<br>
cannula 40 to facilitate handling when handle assembly 80 is removed. Connection<br>
member 50 also includes a proximal sleeve portion 57 extending proximally from<br>
gripping portion 56. Notches 58 are provided in opposite sides of sleeve portion 57,<br>
and as discussed further below, are engageable by a locking element to secure cannula<br>
40 to handle assembly 80. Stylet 60 is positionable in cannula 40 so that distal tip 62<br>
projects distally of distal end 42 when hub 66 is positioned against the proximal end<br>
of connection member 50.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, there is shown lead 100 that extends from handle assembly<br>
80 and is electrically engageable to stylet 60 when stylet 60 is engaged in handle<br>
assembly 80. Link 100 includes a flexible cable portion 102 extending between a<br>
connector 106 at one end and a contact 104 at the opposite end. Connector 106 and<br>
cable portion 102 can include an outer surface layer that is plastic to facilitate<br>
cleaning and protect the conductive wiring, leads and other electrical transmission<br>
structures therein. Connector 106 can be configured for electrical engagement with a<br>
lead from a nerve monitoring system or the like such as the NIM-Spine™ System<br>
marketed by Medtronic, Inc.or any other suitable nerve monitoring system.<br>
Contact 104 is housed within handle assembly 80, and is electrically<br>
engageable to proximal extension 68 of stylet 60 when hub 60 is positioned in handle<br>
assembly 80. In the illustrated embodiment, housing 108 is positioned in the laterally<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
7<br>
oriented bore 88 of handle 80 to secure lead 100 to handle assembly 80. Housing 108<br>
includes a body 110 and a longitudinal trough 112 extending therealong and opening<br>
along a side of housing 108. Body 110 includes axial protrusions 114 and lateral<br>
protrusions 116 projecting into trough 112 that engage cable 102 and maintain it in<br>
position in trough 112. In particular, the opposing lateral protrusions provide restraint<br>
of cable 102 within body 110, and the axial protrusions push and facilitate frictional<br>
engagement of cable 102 against the inner surface defining bore 88. Body 110 can be<br>
engaged in bore 88 via any one or combination of a friction fit, fasteners, adhesives or<br>
welding or fusing of body 110 to handle 80.<br>
With body 110 securely positioned in bore 88, contact 104 projects into a<br>
proximal portion 94 of receptacle 86. The proximal extension 68 of hub 60 is<br>
comprised of an electrically conductive material that contacts contact 104 in proximal<br>
portion 94 and electrically couples stylet 60 and cannula 40 to the electrical signal<br>
source.<br>
Cannula 40 and stylet 60 may be made of stainless surgical steel or other<br>
suitable conductive material of sufficient strength to penetrate tissue of the patient to<br>
the target location. Cannula 40 and stylet 60 can be constructed from a single piece of<br>
suitable conductive material or could be constructed from more than one piece of<br>
suitable conductive material. Cannula 40 is provided with an insulated surface area<br>
between its distal and proximal ends that can be achieved through the use of a coating,<br>
e.g. polyamide coating or through other means, such as an overlaying sleeve of foam<br>
or other material. The insulated surface area ensures the electrical signal is directed to<br>
the target area adjacent the distal ends of stylet 60 and cannula 40 and is not shunted<br>
to surrounding, unintended, tissue or surgical instruments.<br>
Handle assembly 80 is shown in Figs. 2 and 3A-3B. Handle assembly 80<br>
comprises a handle body 82 with an electrically insulated surface area 90 and an<br>
electrically conductive area 95 internal to handle body 82. Access to electrically<br>
conductive area 95 is provided via a distally opening receptacle 86 in a distally<br>
extending neck portion 84 of handle body 82. Neck portion 84 includes a channel 96<br>
that receives a locking element 76. A lateral bore 88 extends transversely to and<br>
opens at a lateral surface 92 of handle body 82. Lead 100 is positioned in bore 88.<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
8<br>
Handle body 82 of handle assembly 80 includes a proximal gripping portion<br>
formed to include a major dimension 83 and a minor dimension 85. The major and<br>
minor dimensions 83, 85 are measured orthogonally to one another and orthogonally<br>
to an extension of longitudinal axis 38 through handle body 82. In one embodiment,<br>
the major dimension is at least 50% greater than the minor dimension. The provision<br>
of handle body 82 with a gripping portion having such major and minor dimensions in<br>
this manner accommodates the hand of the surgeon or other attendant, and facilitates<br>
manipulation and control of needle assembly 30 with handle assembly 80. The<br>
proximal end of body 82 includes continuously curved outer surfaces at its interface<br>
with the user's hand. This enables a user to have a secure and comfortable grasp on<br>
the handle assembly 80. Furthermore, bore 88 extends along the major dimension to<br>
position lead 100 away from the gripping surfaces of body 82. Lead 100 exits one of<br>
the lateral surfaces 92 to prevent lead 100 from interfering with gripping and control<br>
of needle assembly 30.<br>
In another embodiment, lead 100 is engageable with an outlet or receptacle<br>
provided adjacent lateral surface 92. The outlet or receptacle is electrically coupled to<br>
needle assembly 30 in handle assembly 80.<br>
Channel 96 in neck portion 84 opens into axially extending receptacle 86<br>
formed in handle body 82. Receptacle 86 can include a distal portion that has the<br>
same cross-sectional size and shape as the proximal end hub 66 provided on stylet 60.<br>
In addition, the proximal end connection member 50 of cannula 40 includes a<br>
proximal sleeve portion 57 having the same size and shape as receptacle 86. The<br>
form fitting engagement between receptacle 86 and fitting 50 and hub 66 prevents<br>
rotation and provides a secure connection that eliminates movement between needle<br>
assembly 30 and handle assembly 80. In the present embodiment, receptacle 86 has<br>
an oblong shape that is asymmetric. As a result, receptacle 86 will receive the<br>
proximal end portions of stylet 60 and cannula 40 when in proper alignment with the<br>
shape of receptacle 86.<br>
When assembled, proximal sleeve portion 57 of connection member 50 of<br>
cannula 40 occupies receptacle 86 adjacent channel 96, and notches 58 of sleeve<br>
portion 57 are aligned relative to channel 96. Cannula 40 is secured in receptacle 86<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
9<br>
by locking element 76 in channel 96. In one embodiment, stylet 60 is press fit into<br>
receptacle 86 for engagement with handle assembly 80 so that proximal extension 68<br>
of stylet 60 extends into a smaller proximal portion 94 of receptacle 86 and maintains<br>
a constant electrical connection with contact 104 of lead 100, thereby electrically<br>
coupling lead 100 to needle assembly 30.<br>
In another embodiment, stylet 60 is removable from handle assembly 80 and<br>
also removable from cannula 40. In this embodiment, the electrical connection<br>
between lead 100 and stylet 60 can be maintained by any conventional means known<br>
to a person skilled in the art, such as a spring made of a conductive material. Such a<br>
spring could be mounted in bore 88 or receptacle 86, such that it makes contact with a<br>
conductive area of stylet 60 or cannula 40 when attached to handle assembly 80. The<br>
releasable connection also does not interfere with removal of handle assembly 80<br>
from needle assembly 30 when it is desired to withdraw stylet 60 from cannula 40.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, channel 96 comprises a shallow channel<br>
extending circumferentially about neck portion 84, and extends approximately three-<br>
quarters of the way around neck portion 84. Channel 96 includes through-holes 97,<br>
99, which are located opposite from one another and open into side portions of<br>
receptacle 86. Channel 96 begins at first through-hole 97, and extends<br>
counterclockwise approximately one-quarter revolution past second through-hole 99<br>
where it terminates.<br>
Locking element 76 can be in the form of a substantially flat, semicircular<br>
member having an aperture diameter slightly larger than the inner diameter of channel<br>
96. Locking element 76 an outer gripping surface 78, which facilitates rotation of<br>
locking element 76 by the user. Locking element 76 is adapted to fit within channel<br>
96 and has an outer circumference extending slightly less than three-quarters around<br>
neck portion 84.<br>
Locking element 76 can be manipulated and rotated within channel 96 about a<br>
small angular displacement on the order of one-eighth of one rotation. This<br>
effectively allows for locking element 76 to be toggled between two positions, which<br>
correspond to the locked and unlocked configurations relative to handle assembly 80.<br>
When locking element 76 is rotated counterclockwise, no portions of locking element<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
10<br>
76 protrude through through-holes 97 and 99, as shown in Fig. 3A, and locking<br>
element 76 does not obstruct receptacle 86. In this configuration, a groove 72 of<br>
locking element 76 is aligned with second through-hole 99, and on the other side of<br>
channel 96, the end 74 of locking element 76 is located slightly counterclockwise of<br>
second through-hole 97. This position corresponds to the unlocked orientation which<br>
allows removal and insertion of cannula 40 and hub 60 relative to handle assembly<br>
80. Alternatively, when locking element 76 is rotated clockwise as far as possible,<br>
groove 72 is no longer aligned with through-hole 99, thereby causing a portion of<br>
locking element 76 to protrude through through-hole 99 and obstruct one side portion<br>
of passage 86. Additionally, the end 74 of locking element 76 now protrudes through<br>
the other through-hole 97, obstructing the other side portion of passage 86. This<br>
position of locking element 76 corresponds to the locked orientation which engages<br>
cannula 40 in handle assembly 80.<br>
In order to join handle assembly 80 to cannula 40, connection member 50 is<br>
inserted through the distal opening of receptacle 86 of handle assembly 80 when<br>
locking element 76 is in the unlocked orientation. If locking element 76 is in the<br>
locked orientation, then side portions of receptacle 86 will be obstructed by locking<br>
element 76 at through-holes 97, 99, thereby preventing full insertion of cannula 40<br>
into handle assembly 80. When proximal sleeve portion 57 is fully inserted into<br>
passage 86, enlarged gripping portion 56 will abut the distal end of neck portion 84 of<br>
handle assembly 80, and notches 58 in sleeve portion 57 will be aligned with through-<br>
holes 97, 99.<br>
Proximal extension 68 of stylet 60 is electrically engaged with contact 104 of<br>
lead 100 in handle assembly 80. Once the proximal portion of cannula 40 has been<br>
fully inserted into receptacle 86, the user may then lock handle assembly 80 to needle<br>
assembly 30 by rotating locking element 76 clockwise relative to its Fig. 3<br>
orientation. As locking element 76 is rotated from its unlocked position to its locked<br>
position, needle assembly 30 is fixed in place within receptacle 86. Portions of<br>
locking element 76 protrude through through-holes 97, 99 into notches 58 to secure at<br>
least cannula 40 of needle assembly 30 in position relative to handle assembly 80.<br>
The user of needle assembly 30 can use a large amount of force, if necessary, to<br><br>
P22353.01<br>
manipulate and penetrate needle assembly 30 through tissue and/or bone, without<br>
undesired movement of needle assembly 30 relative to handle assembly 80.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and<br>
foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in<br>
character, and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the<br>
invention are desired to be protected.<br><br>
