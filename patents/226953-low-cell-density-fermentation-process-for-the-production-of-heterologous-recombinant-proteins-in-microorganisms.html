PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a low cell density fermentation process for the production of heterologous recombinant proteins in microorganisms.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Fermentation process comprises growing or cultivating microbial cell cultures under controlled conditions for the production of metabolic by¬products such as antibiotics, wine or beer. In recent times, fermentation is also used to produce a number of chemical substances such as proteins possessing pharmacological activity. Fermentation process is carried out in two steps namely growth phase and production phase. The growth phase comprises cultivating host cells transformed with a vector carrying genetic material coding for the desired proteins and an inducible or constitutive promoter in a nutrient medium comprising a carbon source such as glucose, maltose, sorbitol or glycerol; a nitrogen source such as ammonia, nitrate, yeast extract, casamino acids or peptone; and inorganic phosphates and trace elements such as salts of iron, copper, calcium, cobalt, zinc, manganese or molybdenum and optionally antibiotics. During the production phase, the promoter is induced with an inducer for the expression or production of the proteins. During the production phase the growth and metabolic rate of the cell cultures reduce due to diversion of both carbon and energy for the formation of induced protein leading to a change in central carbon metabolism (Schweder T et al, "Role of the general stress response during strong overexpression of a heterologous gene in Escherichia coir Appl. Microbiol Biotech 58: 330-337 (2002). This in turn leads to reduced cell viability, further reduction in growth of cell cultures and expression or yield of the desired proteins and finally termination of the<br><br>
fermentation. Also during fermentation, the nutrient concentration usually that of carbon source being very high, there is excessive acetic acid formation. Production of undesirable by-products such as acetate in the nutrient medium inhibits growth of the microbial cell culture ie do not allow the cells to grow to the required cell concentration. This also inhibits production or expression of proteins. Acetate formation in the cell culture may be reduced by the fed-batch technique wherein microorganisms are grown in a substrate limited medium ie controlled addition of the medium component which leads to products which inhibit the growth of the cells.<br>
Fermentation processes comprising cultivation of cell cultures to achieve cell concentration of about OD6oo=100 (Dry cell weight, DCW~50g/L) are generally known as low cell density fermentations. In low cell density fermentations several fed batch techniques are reported. In one such low cell density fermentations process, acetate formation is controlled by varying the concentration of carbon source made available to the cell culture during the fed batch phase ie carbon source and oxygen is made available to the cell culture in low and high quantities during the fed batch phase. PCT Publication No WO 01/42420 describes a fed-batch phase wherein cultivation of the cells is carried out by addition of carbon source by oscillation feed and/or by variation of stirring speed of the stirrer in the fermenter eg in square or sine waves. In this process growth rate of the cell culture may not be constant due to variations in the amount of carbon source made available to the cell cultures. Therefore, expression and production of the proteins may be variable and is reduced. Besides, this process  requires use of expensive equipments for calculation of the<br><br>
requisite amount of carbon source to be made available to the cell culture during the fed batch phase. [Lin HY and Neubauer P; J Biotechnology, 79(1): 27 - 37, 2000]. Additionally, concentration of carbon source to be made available to the cell culture varies from protein to protein so also the host cells used in the fermentation process. Therefore, the process is very complex and complicated.<br>
Another low cell density fermentation process is described in US Patent No 5714348 wherein cultures of oxygen dependent cells are cultivated and carbon source is made available to the cultures at the rate proportional to the oxygen uptake rate of the cells during the growth phase. When an empirical threshold value is reached during the production phase a constant concentration of carbon source is made available to the culture. During production phase oxygen uptake rate of the cells may not be, however, constant and as the carbon source concentration made available to the cells is constant metabolic rate of the cells reduces leading to reduced growth of cells and expression or yield of the desired proteins.<br>
Predictive and feed back algorithms are also used to obtain maximum yield of proteins in low cell density fermentation process. These algorithms maintain concentration of the carbon source in nutrient medium constant during fermentation thereby controlling production of undesirable by¬products such as acetic acid and allowing growth of the cells at a constant rate. (Kleman G L et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol 57 (4) : 910 - 917, 1991). In order to define these algorithms extensive archived data for carbon source consumption rates are required.  Moreover, these    algorithms vary<br><br>
for different organisms. The process is, therefore, complex and expensive. (Kleman G L et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol 57(4): 910-917, 1991).<br>
US Patent No 5,595,905 relates to a fermentation process wherein the carbon source" concentration in the nutrient medium is regulated by means of computer programs. This process involves withdrawal of samples of the fermentation broth at regular intervals of time, measurement of the carbon source consumption in each of the samples and prediction of the quantity of nutrient medium to be added to the fermentation broth for regulation of the carbon source concentration in the medium after comparing the rate of consumption of the carbon source of the different samples of the fermentation broth. This process is very complex and complicated. Besides, the rate of addition of the nutrient medium to the fermentation broth may vary from organism to organism. Also, the process makes use of computers with sophisticated computational capability and other equipments which are very expensive thereby rendering the process uneconomical.<br>
PCT Publication No WO 02/40697 describes a low cell density fermentation process wherein yield of usable proteins is increased by reducing the metabolic rate of the cell culture during the production phase of the fed batch phase by decreasing the concentration of oxygen available to the cell culture. The reduction in the metabolic rate of the cell culture does not allow the cells to grow to the required concentration thereby resulting in reduced yield of usable proteins. Due to variation of metabolic rates, stresses on the cells may increase and limit the duration for which the cultivation can be effectively operated.<br><br>
Another low cell density fermentation process comprises separating the growth and production phase of the fed batch phase by carrying them out in two separate fermenters using different nutrient media. The process may also involve testing of the genetic stability of the cells in the two media. The process is complex, cumbersome and expensive. There are also chances of the cell cultures being contaminated due to transfer of the cell cultures from fermenter to fermenter. [Chang C C et al; Appl. Microbiol Biotechnol; 49(5): 531 -537,1998)].<br>
In order to obtain high yield of usable proteins during low cell density fermentation, feasible quadratic programming algorithms are also employed. These algorithms may vary for different organisms and require extensive knowledge and data on the behaviour of the organism and computational techniques thereby rendering the process very complex and expensive [Chen Q et al; Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol; 51 - 52 : 449 -461; 1995].<br>
PCT Publication No WO 96/39523    describes    a    low cell density<br>
N-	,	■    ■—	—	—<br>
fermentation process for the production of hydrophobic proteins such as interferon - beta, wherein the nutrient medium in which the cells are cultured comprises low potassium and sodium cations and glycerol as the carbon source. As these components are used by the cells for their growth, the concentration of these ions in the nutrient medium reduces and needs to be replenished periodically. This involves measurement of the concentration of the cations in the fermentation broth by taking out samples of the fermentation broth at regular intervals of time. The fermenter used for this<br><br>
fermentation process may require modification for the addition of the cations in the fermentation broth at different points of time. Due to frequent sampling of the fermentation broth there may be chances of the fermentation broth getting contaminated.<br>
Low cell density fermentation techniques in general employ short fermentation cycles because of which fermentation time and running cost of fermentation are reduced. Consequently number of fermentations in unit time and percentage of productive fermentation are increased. Low density fermentation generates reduced biomass correspondingly reducing disposal problem thereof. At low cell fermentation densities, feed volume reduces and it is possible to achieve the desired density within volume limits imposed by the geometry of the fermenters. Low cell density fermentation techniques, however, differ depending on the host cell cultures and proteins of interest. Therefore the same low cell density fermentation process is not generally applicable to different cell cultures to produce different proteins. Also due to factors described above and due to cell concentrations achieved being low, yield and expression of proteins obtained by low cell density fermentations may be low. Generally yields of proteins are in the range of few (hundred) mgs to 1 gm (87 mg/L, Lee, J.Y., Yoon, C.S., et al, "Scale-up process for expression and renaturation of recombinant human epidermal growth factor from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies", Biotechnol Appl Biochem, 31:245-248, (2000); 150 mg/L, WO 02/077205 A2; 60 mg/L, Shimizu, N., Fukuzono, S., et al, Biotechnol. Bioeng., 38: 37-42, (1991); 600 mg/L, Tsai,L.B., Mann, M., et al, J. Ind. Microbiol. 2: 181-187, (1987).<br><br>
I<br><br>
High cell density fermentation processes are used to obtain increased yields of usable proteins by increasing the amount of fermenting cells. Fermentation processes comprising cultivation of cell cultures to achieve cell concentrations of about OD60o 150 (DCW~80g/L) and above are generally known as high cell density fermentations. Acetic acid formation is also encountered in high cell density fermentation because of which yield and expression of proteins are hampered. Generally yields of heterologous proteins are reported in the range of 56 mgs to 5.6 gms/L (Lee S.Y., Trends. Biotech. 14: 98-105 1996). Besides these processes require specialized equipments for supply of pure oxygen and explosion protection which are very expensive. High cell density fermentation processes also make use of expensive components such as polyphosphates in the nutrient medium to avoid precipitation of inorganic phosphates (EP Patent No 0755438). These processes also generate huge amounts of biomass whose disposal is cumbersome and expensive.<br>

After growth for 8 hours at 37°C on a rotary shaker (200 - 220 rpm), 100 ml of the culture from the flask was used to innoculate 2 jar fermenters (2 litres, B Braun) containing 900 ml of the basal medium.<br>
Fermentation was carried out in the fermenters at a temperature of 37°C and pH   of  the two fermentation broths were maintained   at   pH7 using<br><br>
12.5% of ammonia solution. The dissolved oxygen tension (dOT) was 50% air pressure for 16 hours of the fermentation time and was controlled by automatic adjustment of the fermenters stirrer speed. When OD6oo of approximately 1 was reached or at 2 hours after fermentation was started, the feed medium comprising glucose 25% (carbon source) and yeast extract 20% (nitrogen source) and further comprising FS4 solution (15 ml of FS4 solution for 600 ml of the feed medium) was pumped into the two fermenters following a feed strategy as set out in Fig 1 of the accompanying drawings (low feed rate). The initial feed rate was 3 ml/hr and was raised exponentially by an exponent of 0.3. After 8 hours from start of the fermentation or when a cell concentration of OD6oo 15 was obtained, one of the fermenters was inoculated with an inducer solution containing 0.1 - 4% inducer namely arabinose between OD60o of 15 to 40. Excessive foaming was controlled with the addition of antifoam solution (Dow Corning 1510, Antifoam). Fermentations were performed for 25 hours and during that time samples were taken for measurement of optical density and accumulation of rhG-CSF within the cells. rhG-CSF accumulation was measured by scanning Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels of whole cell lysates in known manner.<br><br>
Yield of approximately 36% of rhG-CSF was obtained in the fermenter where production was induced. The experimental results are tabulated in Table 1 below and illustrated in Fig 2 of the accompanying drawings.<br>

The experimental results show that the increase in bacterial density in the two fermenters is almost similar inspite of production being induced in one of the fermenters. A pronounced growth phase independent production of the protein rhG-CSF was observed. The cells grow at a constant rate throughout the entire fermentation process. Figure 2 illustrates the chronological course of the cell concentrations in the two fermenters wherein production of protein rhG-CSF was induced in one of the fermenters. Fig 2 shows the cell concentrations of the host E-Coli cells (measured at ODeoo) as a function of time.<br>
Fig 3 of the accompanying drawings shows stirrer speeds of the fermenters, pH of the fermentation broths and dissolved oxygen tensions maintained in the fermenters as functions of time. It is seen from the figure that except for the inoculation of one fermenter with the inducer solution, the feed rate, medium and fermentation conditions for the two fermenters were identical.<br>

It is seen from the table that growth is not inhibited since formation of acetate is maintained at less than 1 gm/L for the duration of the fermentation process under   the fermentation conditions.   Therefore, the<br><br>
cells   grow   at   a   constant rate   during the entire fermentation process resulting in good yield of the desired proteins rhG-CSF.<br>

It is seen from the table that reduction in the rate at which feed medium is pumped into the fermenter led to an increased yield of the desired protein rhG-CSF by approximately 50% and did not inhibit the growth of the cells.<br>
Figure 6 of the accompanying drawings illustrates the chronological course of stirrer speed, pH and dOT during the fermentation of Example lb as functions of time. A comparison of the fermentation conditions (pH, stirrer speed and p02) in the two fermenters shows that stirrer speed of the<br><br>
fermenter wherein feed medium was fed in at a low rate was less as compared to the stirrer speed of the other fermenter (Fig 6). Also, variations in pH and p02 of the fermentation broth in the fermenter employing low feed rate is minimal. This shows that stresses on the cells in the fermenter employing low feed rate is less as compared to that in the fermenter employing high feed rate.<br>

It is seen from the table that the amount of rhG-CSF obtained in the fermenter wherein production was induced at the start of the fermentation was comparable to the amount of rhG-CSF obtained from the other fermenter wherein production was induced at a later point of time in the fermentation.<br>
Also, cell concentrations achieved in the two fermenters were also similar ie production does not inhibit cell growth.   This further establishes that cell<br><br>
growth and production of desired proteins are independent of each other.

A single colony from the 2XYT plate was removed and inoculated into a falcon tube containing 10 ml of 2XYT liquid medium. Aftergrowth for 16 hours at 37°C on a rotary shaker (200 - 220 rpm), 5 ml of the culture from the tube was inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 100 ml of the basal medium. After growth for 8 hours at 37°C on a rotary shaker (200 - 220 rpm), 100 ml of the culture from the flask was used to inoculate a jar fermenter (2 litres, Braun) containing 900 ml of the basal medium. The fermentation conditions and duration of fermentation were the same as those in Example 2. The feed medium pumped into the fermenter was identical to that used in Example 2 except that the carbon source in the feed medium was glycerol (25%).  The feed strategy followed was also<br><br>

The experimental results show that increase in bacterial density and percentage of yield of rhGH were almost similar to those obtained in the fermenter of Example 2 wherein production was induced.<br><br>
The following examples namely Examples 2c and 2d illustrate that controlling of the fermentation of Example 2 by<br>
1)	changing the rate at which cultures were fed with the feed medium and<br>
2)	changing the concentration of the inducer solution fed into the fermenter resulted in higher expression or yield of the desired protein ie rhGH.<br>
Example 2c E Coli strain TOP 10 transformed to express recombinant human growth hormone rhGH was purified and maintained in glycerol stocks. An aliquot of the culture was removed from the stock and streaked on 2XYT plate to separate single colonies after growth of 24 hours at 37°C. A single colony from the 2XYT plate was removed and inoculated into a falcon tube containing 10 ml of 2XYT liquid medium.

The fermentation   conditions and duration of  fermentation were the same as<br><br>
those in Example 2. The feed medium pumped into the fermenters was identical to the one used in Example 2 and followed the feed strategies as set out in Fig 1 (high feed rate and higher feed rate). In the first fermenter, the initial feed rate was 3 ml/hr and was raised exponentially till 18 mL/hr and thereafter linearly with a slope of 2 (high feed rate). In the second fermenter, the initial feed rate was 3 ml/hr and was raised exponentially till 18 mL/hr and thereafter linearly with a slope of 2.4. (higher feed rate). Production in the fermenters was induced as per Example 2. Yield of 32% of rhGH was obtained in the fermenter employing high feed rate and 34% of rhGH was obtained in the fermenter employing higher feed rate.<br>

It is seen from the table that reduction in the rate at which feed medium was pumped into the fermenter led to an increased volumetric yield of the desired protein rhGH by approximately 45% and did not inhibit the growth of the cells.<br>

stirrer speed and p02) in the two fermenters seen in the figure shows that there are no variations, indicating that cell physiology remained the same in the two fermenters inspite of the difference in the feed rate. However, bacterial density achieved and percentage of rhGH expressed in the fermenter employing higher feed rate was more .<br>
Example 2d E Coli strain TOP 10 transformed to express recombinant human GH was purified and maintained in glycerol stocks. An aliquot of the culture was removed from the stock and streaked on 2XYT plate to separate single colonies after growth of 24 hours at 37°C.

Example 3 E Coli strain TOP 10 transformed to express recombinant human platelet derived growth factor rhPDGF was purified and maintained in glycerol stocks. An aliquot of the culture was removed from the stock and streaked on 2XYT plate to separate single colonies after growth of 24 hours at 37°C. A single colony from the 2XYT plate was removed and inoculated into a falcon tube containing 10 ml of 2XYT liquid medium. After growth for 16 hours at 37°C on a rotary shaker (200 - 220 rpm), 5 ml of the culture from the tube was inoculated into a 500 ml conical flask containing 100 ml of the basal medium. After growth for 8 hours at 37°C on a rotary shaker (200-220 rpm), 100 mis of the culture from the flask was used to innoculate 2 jar fermenters (2 litres, B Braun) containing 900 ml of the basal medium.<br>
The two fermentations were carried out at a temperature of 37°C and pH of the two fermentation broths were maintained at pH7 using 12.5% of ammonia solution.    The dissolved  oxygen tension (dOT) was   50% air<br><br>
pressure for 16 hours of the fermentation time and was controlled by automatic adjustment of the fermenters stirrer speed. When OD60o of approximately 2 was reached or at 2 hours after fermentation was started, feed medium containing concentration of glucose 20% (carbon source) and yeast 20% (nitrogen source) and comprising FS4 solution (15 ml of FS4 solution for 600 ml of the feed medium) was pumped into the two fermenters following a feed strategy as set out in Fig 1 (low feed rate). The initial feed rate was 0.1 ml/hr and was raised exponentially till 18 mL/hr and thereafter linearly by a slope of 1.2. After 8 hours from the start of the fermentation or when a cell concentration of OD60o 20 was obtained, one of the fermenters was inoculated with an inducer solution containing 0.1 -4% of the inducer arabinose between OD60o of 20 to 50. Excessive foaming was controlled with the addition of antifoam solution (Dow Corning 1510, Antifoam). Fermentations were performed for 24 hours during which samples were taken for measurement of optical density and accumulation of rhPDGF within the cells. rhPDGF accumulation was measured by scanning Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels of whole cell lysates in known manner.<br><br>
Yield of approximately 46% of rhPDGF was obtained. The experimental results are tabulated in the Table 12 below and illustrated in Fig 11 of the accompanying drawings.<br>

The experimental results show that irrespective of the concentration of the inducer in the inducer solution percentage of expression remained the same except that high levels of expressions in the two fermenters occurred at different points of time. Even though the concentration of the inducer was reduced by a factor of 100 the expression reduced only to half. This shows that various inducible promoters of varying strength and various optical density may be used in the fermentation process.<br>

When OD60o of approximately 1 was reached or at 2 hours after fermentation was started, the feed medium comprising glucose 25% (carbon source) and yeast extract 20% (nitrogen source) and further comprising FS4 solution (15 ml of FS4 solution for 600 ml of the feed medium) was pumped into the fermenter following a feed strategy as set out in Fig 1 of the accompanying drawings (high feed rate). The initial feed rate was 0.1 ml/hr and was raised exponentially till 18 mL/hr and thereafter linearly by a slope of 2.4. After 8 hours from start of the fermentation or when a cell concentration of OD60o 15 was obtained, the fermenter was inoculated with an inducer solution containing 0.1 - 4% inducer namely arabinose between OD60o of 15 to 40. Excessive foaming was controlled with the addition of antifoam solution (Dow Corning 1510, Antifoam). Fermentation was performed for 25 hours and during that time samples were   taken for measurement of optical density and accumulation of p-<br><br>
galactosidase within the cells. P-galactosidase accumulation was measured by scanning Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels of whole cell lysates in known manner.<br>
Yield of approximately  15-20% of p-galactosidase was obtained in the fermenter. The experimental results are tabulated in Table 16 below.<br>

The above examples show that heterologus recombinant proteins are produced by the process of the invention and the same feed medium is used for the entire fermentation process. The feed strategy employed is simple and easy to carry out and involves raising the initial feed rate exponentially and/or linearly using standard formulas. The acetate formed during the fermentation process of the invention is low and maintained at less than 1 gm/L. No equipments are used to control the formation of undesirable by-products thereby rendering the process economical and simple to carry out. Cells grow at a constant rate throughout the fermentation process. Also, the fermentation process of the invention ensures cell growth and expression of proteins simultaneously and independently throughout the entire process. Maximum cell concentration achieved is OD60o of about 100. Due to reduced cell concentration, the biomass produced is also correspondingly<br><br>
