				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TREATMENT AGENT AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF, AND<br>
TREATMENT METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a treatment agent, a<br>
method of producing the treatment agent, and a treatment method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Fluorine is contained in effluents discharged in the<br>
processes of aluminum electrolytic refining, phosphorus<br>
fertilizer production, pickling of metal such as stainless<br>
steel, and washing of electric parts such as silicone; fume<br>
cleaning effluent from garbage incinerators; effluent of<br>
coal-fired flue gas desulfurization; or the like. Meanwhile,<br>
effluent standards have been implemented, and disposal<br>
treatment has been performed to meet the standards.<br>
[0003]<br>
The methods of disposing fluorine generally practiced at<br>
present are as follows: A method including adding a calcium salt<br>
to generate calcium fluoride (CaF2) , which is poorly soluble,<br>
and precipitating and separating the calcium fluoride; a method<br>
including adding an aluminum salt so that fluorine<br>
coprecipitates with aluminum hydroxide (A1(OH)3), and<br>
separating the fluorine; or a combination method of the<br>
coagulation and precipitation with a calcium salt and the<br>
coagulation and precipitation with an aluminum salt (see, for<br>
example, Non-Patent Document 1).<br>
[0004]<br>
Due to the stricter effluent standard and environmental<br>
standard for fluorine these days, a fluorine-containing<br>
effluent needs to be highly disposed. However, the<br>
 <br>
conventional coagulation and precipitation with a calcium salt<br>
can very hardly achieve the effluent standard for fluorine of<br>
8 mg/L or less.<br>
[0005]<br>
In the method of coprecipitation with aluminum hydroxide,<br>
a technique of adding aluminum sulfate (Al2 (SO4) 316H2O) as a<br>
coagulation agent is known (see, for example, Patent Document<br>
1). However, this conventional technique requires separation<br>
of the treated water and sludge formed of the coprecipitate in<br>
an amount of not less than the added aluminum sulfate, and<br>
further requires cumbersome treatment processes such as<br>
treatment of the separated sludge to avoid elution of fluorine<br>
therefrom and then burying the treated sludge in the ground.<br>
[0006]<br>
In order to solve the problems involved in the<br>
conventional art, a method is disclosed which includes use of<br>
a poorly soluble phosphoric acid salt, as a fluorine treatment<br>
agent capable of achieving the effluent standard, to fix and<br>
remove fluorine in an effluent as fluoroapatite (see, Patent<br>
Documents 2 and 3).<br>
[0007]<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses that addition of only a<br>
phosphoric acid salt and/or a phosphoric acid compound can<br>
reduce the fluorine concentration in an effluent to 0.S mg/L<br>
or less.<br>
[0008]<br>
In general, however, the method of treating a<br>
fluorine-containing effluent with a phosphoric acid salt and/or<br>
a phosphoric acid compound is characterized in that fluorine<br>
and the phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid compound<br>
form a complex salt at a ratio determined by the chemical<br>
compositions thereof, and the method can remove a<br>
stoichiometric amount of fluorine at maximum. For this purpose,<br>
the phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid compound need<br>
to be used in a fine powder form.<br>
 <br>
[0009]<br>
A method in which a dispersive contactor is used may be<br>
listed as one example of the treatment process for allowing the<br>
finely-powdered phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid<br>
compound to contact with the fluorine-containing effluent<br>
include (see, for example, Patent Documents 4 and 5).<br>
[0010]<br>
As a simpler treatment method, a process is normally<br>
employed in which a fluorine-containing effluent is flown<br>
through a packed bed densely filled with the finely-powdered<br>
phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid compound so as to<br>
remove fluorine.<br>
[0011]<br>
Meanwhile, as a technique for suppressing elution of<br>
fluorine, an agent which is produced by suspending powdered<br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate in water so that the<br>
surface of the powder is activated is disclosed (see, for<br>
example, Patent Document 6) as a treatment agent for<br>
insolubilizing fluorine in fluorine-contaminated soil.<br>
Moreover, as a method of treating gypsum for suppressing elution<br>
of the contained fluorine, a method is disclosed which includes<br>
aging a fluorine-containing gypsum for a predetermined period<br>
in water in the presence of calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate<br>
in an amount of 1 to 5 parts by mass for 100 parts by mass of<br>
calcium sulfate dihydrate in the gypsum, and collecting the<br>
gypsum (see, for example, Patent Document 7).<br>

SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
[0014]<br>
The method of dispersing a finely-powdered phosphoric<br>
acid salt and/or a phosphoric acid compound in a contactor, as<br>
disclosed in Patent Documents 4 and 5, is characterized by<br>
reacting the phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid<br>
compound with fluorine so that elution of those substances is<br>
suppressed. However, the phosphoric acid salt and/or<br>
phosphoric acid compound need to be powdered as finely as<br>
possible in order to fix the fluorine at the stoichiometric<br>
ratio to the phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid<br>
compound. Such fine powders may problematically reduce the<br>
treatment speed.<br>
[0015]<br>
Moreover, as described earlier, the method of removing<br>
fluorine by allowing a fluorine-containing effluent to flow<br>
through a packed bed densely filled with the finely-powdered<br>
phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid compound has the<br>
following problems. Namely, since finer powdering of the<br>
phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid compound leads to<br>
not only worse permeability of the packed bed but also higher<br>
pressure loss, the packed bed needs to be pressure-resistant.<br>
Also, the finely-powdered phosphoric acid salt and/or<br>
phosphoric acid compound are suspended in water, and are thus<br>
hardly separable from water.<br>
[0016]<br>
In contrast, in the case where the packed pad used is<br>
filled with the phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid<br>
compound granulated in a manner to have a larger grain size so<br>
 <br>
that the permeability of the packed pad is increased, the<br>
phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid compound react with<br>
fluorine on the surfaces of the grain. Problematically the<br>
amount of the fluorine to be removed per unit weight of the<br>
phosphoric acid salt and/or phosphoric acid compound decreases.<br>
[0017]<br>
The present invention aims to solve the foregoing<br>
problems involved in the conventional techniques and to provide<br>
a treatment agent and a treatment method which can simply and<br>
effectively remove fluorine in an effluent.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0018]<br>
The present invention relates to a treatment agent<br>
including: calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) ; and<br>
particles (B) , wherein the particles (B) carry the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A).<br>
[0019]<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of<br>
producing the treatment agent, including mixing the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) and the particles (B) with a<br>
tilting gravity mixer.<br>
[0020]<br>
The present invention further relates to a treatment<br>
method including allowing the treatment agent to make contact<br>
with a fluorine-containing water to be treated, to thereby<br>
remove the fluorine from the water to be treated.<br>
[0021]<br>
The present invention further relates to a treatment<br>
method including mixing the treatment agent with a<br>
fluorine-containing soil, to thereby insolubilize the fluorine<br>
in the soil.<br>
The following describes the present invention in more<br>
detail.<br>
[0022]<br>
 <br>
The present invention relates to a treatment agent<br>
containing calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) and<br>
particles (B) (provided that particles of calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate dihydrate (A) are excluded) . Since the particles (B)<br>
carry the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) , the flowing<br>
of a fluorine-containing water to be treated through the<br>
treatment agent of the present invention can substantially<br>
prevent the powdered calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A)<br>
from eluting off for a long period of time. Also, excellent<br>
permeability can be kept for a long period of time, and is further<br>
possible to maintain the fluorine concentration of the water<br>
to be treated at 0.8 mg/L or less for a long period of time.<br>
The "carry" used herein refers to a state where the particles<br>
(B) as a carrier support the calcium hydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate (A) in a manner that the particles hold the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A).<br>
[0023]<br>
The treatment agent of the present invention can be<br>
obtained by mixing the powdered calcium hydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate (A) with the particles (B) . Since the particles (B)<br>
carry the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A), the<br>
particle diameter is large. For this reason, the treatment<br>
agent of the present invention tends not to form lumps<br>
(coagulation) and exhibits excellent permeability. Moreover,<br>
since the particles (B) carry the calcium hydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate (A) , the treatment agent of the present invention is<br>
not easily scattered, and thus exhibits excellent handleability.<br>
Further, since the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A)<br>
itself keeps the particle diameter small (fine powder state),<br>
a sufficient amount of fluorine can be removed.<br>
[0024]<br>
The treatment agent of the present invention contains the<br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A). Therefore, when the<br>
treatment agent is allowed to contact with water and the like,<br>
fluorine in the water and the like can be removed. Moreover,<br>
 <br>
mixing the treatment agent with fluorine-contaminated soil can<br>
insolubilize fluorine in the fluorine-contained soil as<br>
fluorine apatite so that the fluorine in the soil can be<br>
prevented from eluting. The calcium hydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate (A) has an excellent effect especially in<br>
insolubilizing the fluorine in the fluorine-contaminated soil<br>
as fluorine apatite. For example, although calcium phosphate<br>
(Ca3(PO4)2) has an effect of insolubilizing fluorine in<br>
fluorine-contaminated soil, the effect is inferior to that of<br>
the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A).<br>
[0025]<br>
Fluorine apatite itself is a main component of natural<br>
phosphate rocks. The treatment agent of the present invention<br>
does not contain other organic substances, heavy metals, or the<br>
like. Therefore, the treatment agent can reduce the elution<br>
amount of fluorine from fluorine-contaminated soil to 0.8 mg/L<br>
or less in a simple, cost-effective, and assured manner without<br>
causing any secondary environmental pollution.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the treatment agent, the amount of the calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate dihydrate (A) is preferably 1 to 100 parts by mass<br>
for 100 parts by mass of the particles (B). If the amount is<br>
set in this range, the particles (B) can efficiently carry the<br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) . As a result, the<br>
treatment agent has improved permeability with an excellent<br>
capability of removing fluorine. The amount of the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) is more preferably 5 to 50<br>
parts by mass and further preferably 7 to 15 parts by mass for<br>
100 parts by mass of the particle (B).<br>
[0027]<br>
The calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) is<br>
preferably in a powder form, and more preferably has an average<br>
particle diameter of 30 to 70 µm. If the average particle<br>
diameter is in the above range, the particles (B) efficiently<br>
carry the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A), and thus<br>
 <br>
the treatment agent has an excellent fluorine-removing ability.<br>
[0028]<br>
The average particle diameter of the calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate dihydrate (A) was measured with a Microtrack 9320HRA<br>
(product of Nikkiso Co., Ltd.) according to a laser<br>
diffraction-scattering method.<br>
[0029]<br>
The particle surface of the calcium hydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate (A) may be activated, which is one of the preferable<br>
embodiments. The fluorine-insolubilizing action is further<br>
enhanced when the particle surface is activated by suspending<br>
the powders of the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate in<br>
water.<br>
[0030]<br>
After suspending the powder particles of the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) in water, followed by stirring<br>
or shaking, the resulting particles collected from the<br>
suspension have, on the surfaces, a large number of<br>
uniformly-deposited fine crystals having a size of<br>
approximately several tens nm. The surfaces of such particles<br>
are activated, and thereby, for example, fluorine in<br>
fluorine-contaminated soil can be more efficiently<br>
insolubilized. For this reason, the particle surface of the<br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) to be contained in the<br>
treatment agent of the present invention is preferably<br>
activated by suspending the powder particles of the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) in water.<br>
[0031]<br>
The particles (B) are particles capable of carrying the<br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A). If the particles (B)<br>
carry the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A), the<br>
treatment agent excellent in permeability and<br>
fluorine-removing action can be obtained.<br>
[0032]<br>
Examples of the particles (B) include filter sand and<br>
 <br>
filter gravel generally used for purifying water, but are not<br>
limited thereto. Sand is also preferably used as the particles<br>
(B) .<br>
[0033]<br>
Preferably, the particles (B) substantially have a<br>
particle diameter of 0.3 to 3.0 mm. More preferably, the<br>
particles (B) consist only of particles substantially having<br>
a particle diameter of 0.3 to 3.0 mm. In the particles (B) ,<br>
preferably 90% by mass or more, more preferably 99% by mass or<br>
more, and further preferably 99. 9% by mass or more of the total<br>
particles have a particle diameter of 0.3 to 3.0 mm. The<br>
particles (B) especially preferably do not include particles<br>
having a particle diameter of less than 0.3 mm and particles<br>
having a particle diameter of more than 3.0 mm. The particles<br>
(B) having a particle diameter within the above range can<br>
efficiently carry the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) ,<br>
resulting in the treatment agent with excellent permeability<br>
and excellent action of removing fluorine-containing compounds.<br>
The particles (B) most preferably do not substantially include<br>
particles having a particle diameter of more than 2.8 mm.<br>
[0034]<br>
The particle diameter of the particles (B) is determined<br>
by a manual sieving test with a standard wire sieve (JIS Z8801,<br>
nominal dimension: 0.3 to 3.0 mm, sieve size: 200, depth: 45<br>
mm) . In the case of avoiding particles having a particle<br>
diameter of more than 2.8 mm, a sieve having a nominal dimension<br>
of 2.8 mm is used.<br>
[0035]<br>
The particles (B) preferably have a uniformity<br>
coefficient of 1.5 or less. The particles (B) having a<br>
uniformity coefficient in the above range can efficiently carry<br>
the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) , resulting in the<br>
treatment agent having better permeability and excellent action<br>
of removing the fluorine-containing compounds.<br>
The uniformity coefficient of the particles (B) is<br>
 <br>
measured according to JWWA A103-l:2004.<br>
[0036]<br>
The treatment agent of the present invention may contain,<br>
if desired, a component other than the calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate dihydrate (A) and the particles (B) within the range<br>
not adversely affecting the purpose of the present invention.<br>
However, the total amount of the calcium hydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate (A) and the particle (B) is preferably 99% by mass<br>
or more in the treatment agent of the present invention.<br>
[0037]<br>
The treatment agent of the present invention is<br>
preferably a treatment agent for a fluorine-containing water<br>
or preferably a treatment agent for a fluorine-containing soil.<br>
[0038]<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of<br>
producing the treatment agent, including mixing the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) and the particles (B) with a<br>
tilting gravity mixer.<br>
[0039]<br>
The tilting gravity mixer is not particularly limited,<br>
as long as the mixer is so-called a tilting gravity mixer having<br>
a structure in which a mixing container for mixing the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) and the particles (B) is<br>
attached to a tilting mechanism. The tilting mechanism is a<br>
mechanism to tilt the mixing container.<br>
[0040]<br>
One example of the configuration of the tilting gravity<br>
mixer is a mixer including: a frustroconical-shaped container,<br>
with one of its end opened and the other end closed, which is<br>
attached as a mixing container to a tilting mechanism; and<br>
mixing blades attached to the inner wall of the mixing container,<br>
or the like may be exemplified. The mixing container is<br>
preferably rotatable.<br>
[0041]<br>
Upon mixing the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A)<br>
 <br>
and the particles (B), normally the following operations are<br>
performed: The tilting gravity mixer is operated so that an<br>
opening month of the drum faces upward; while the mixing<br>
container is rotated on a certain direction, the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) and the particles (B) are<br>
introduced thereinto; the introduced materials are lifted by<br>
a blade and are dropped off, and are mixed by repetition of the<br>
operation.<br>
Mixing with the tilting gravity mixer is promoted<br>
depending on the behavior of the introduced materials.<br>
Therefore, the mixing can be performed while favorably keeping<br>
the state of the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) being<br>
carried by the particles (B). In this manner, the tilting<br>
gravity mixer has an excellent effect on production of the<br>
treatment agent.<br>
[0042]<br>
A preferable method of producing the treatment agent<br>
includes introducing the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate<br>
(A) and the particles (B) in the mixing container of the tilting<br>
gravity mixer, adding water depending on the need, and mixing<br>
the materials.<br>
[0043]<br>
The present invention further relates to a treatment<br>
method including allowing the treatment agent to make contact<br>
with fluorine-containing water to be treated so as to remove<br>
the fluorine in the water to be treated (hereinafter, also<br>
referred to as "fluorine-removing treatment method").<br>
[0044]<br>
The contact between the water to be treated and the<br>
treatment agent may be a batch-type contact of adding the<br>
treatment agent to the water to be treated, or may be a<br>
continuous-type contact of flowing the water to be treated<br>
through a column filled with the treatment agent. Moreover,<br>
the treatment may include several times of the batch-type<br>
contact, or several times of the continuous-type contact, or<br>
 <br>
a combination of the batch-type contact and the continuous-type<br>
contact. The filling column used in the continuous-type<br>
contact may be of any type among a moving-bed type, fixed-bed<br>
type, and fluidized-bed type.<br>
[0045]<br>
The fluorine-removing treatment method of the present<br>
invention may include a step of collecting a treated water<br>
having a fluorine concentration of 0.8 mg/L or less. Since the<br>
treatment agent is excellent in permeability and reaction<br>
efficiency, it can remove fluorine in the water to be treated<br>
efficiently enough to reduce the fluorine concentration to 0 . 8<br>
mg/L or less in the water. In the treatment agent, the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) is carried by the particles<br>
(B) having a relatively large particle diameter. For this<br>
reason, the water to be treated can be prevented from suspending,<br>
and thus the treatment agent and the treated water can be easily<br>
separated.<br>
[0046]<br>
The amount of fluorine in the water to be treated is not<br>
particularly limited. The treatment agent can exert excellent<br>
fluorine-removing ability even if the fluorine concentration<br>
is high or low; for example, the fluorine concentration is<br>
preferably 0.1 mg/L or more. In order to exert a greater effect<br>
of the present invention, the water to be treated having a<br>
fluorine concentration of more than 0 . 8 mg/L is more preferable.<br>
[0047]<br>
In the present invention, the fluorine ion concentration<br>
in the fluorine-containing water can be measured by a method<br>
in accordance with JIS K0102.<br>
[0048]<br>
The water to be treated to which the treatment agent is<br>
to contact is not particularly limited as long as the water<br>
contains fluorine (fluorine-containing water), and examples<br>
thereof include industrial effluent, spring water, and river<br>
water. Examples of the industrial effluent include<br>
 <br>
fluorine-containing effluent discharged from silicon wafer<br>
plants, semiconductor plants, or the like, acid-cleaning<br>
effluent discharged from metal plants, effluent resulting from<br>
aluminium surface treatment, effluent resulting from<br>
hydrofluoric acid production, fertilizer production effluent,<br>
and garbage incineration effluent.<br>
[0049]<br>
The water to be treated preferably has a pH of 3 or higher<br>
in the point that high fluorine ion-removing efficiency is<br>
achievable with the pH value. Therefore, the treated water<br>
obtained by the fluorine-removing treatment method of the<br>
present invention (hereinafter, also simply referred to as<br>
"treated water") also preferably has a pH of 3 or higher. Both<br>
of the pH values are more preferably 4 or higher. In the case<br>
that the pH value of the water to be treated or the treated water<br>
is lower than 3, or the pH value reaches less than 3 in the steps,<br>
the pH value may be adjusted to 3 or higher with sodium hydroxide,<br>
calcium hydroxide, or the like.<br>
[0050]<br>
The water to be treated and the treated water preferably<br>
have a pH of 11 or lower. A pH value higher than 11 may hinder<br>
progress of reaction between the calcium hydrogen phosphate<br>
dihydrate (A) and fluorine ion. In the case that the<br>
fluorine-containing water or the treated water has a pH higher<br>
than 11, or the pH exceeds 11 in the steps, the pH value may<br>
be adjusted to 11 or less with hydrochloric acid, or the like.<br>
[0051]<br>
The fluorine-removing treatment method mentioned earlier<br>
can achieve the fluorine-removing amount for 1 g of the calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) of 1 mg-F/g or more, and more<br>
preferably 10 mg-F/g or more.<br>
[0052]<br>
The fluorine-removing treatment method of the present<br>
invention may include a step of adding calcium ion to the water<br>
to be treated to generate calcium fluoride (CaF2) , and a step<br>
 <br>
of removing the generated calcium fluoride to collect the water<br>
to be treated with reduced fluorine ion concentration. These<br>
steps are preferably performed before the step of allowing the<br>
treatment agent to make contact with the fluorine-containing<br>
water to be treated to remove the fluorine in the water to be<br>
treated. Since relatively cost-effective calcium compounds<br>
are used in the steps, the cost can be reduced especially if<br>
the fluorine ion concentration is high in the water to be treated.<br>
The calcium ion is preferably added as a calcium compound such<br>
as calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) , and<br>
calcium chloride (CaCl2)<br>
[0053]<br>
Fluorine is sufficiently removed from the treated water.<br>
Accordingly, the treated water has a low fluorine concentration<br>
(for example, 0 . 8 mg/L or less) , and thereby meets environmental<br>
standards.<br>
[0054]<br>
The present invention further relates to a treatment<br>
method including mixing the treatment agent and a<br>
fluorine-containing soil so that the fluorine in the soil is<br>
insolubilized (hereafter, referred also to as "fluorine<br>
insolubilizing treatment method"). Upon mixing the treatment<br>
agent and the fluorine-containing soil, the calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate dihydrate (A) reacts with soluble fluorine ion in the<br>
soil to form an insoluble fluoroapatite described as<br>
Ca10(PO4)6F2.<br>
In the case that the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate<br>
(A) alone is mixed with the fluorine-containing soil, the<br>
calcium hydrogen phosphate forms agglomerates (coagulations) ,<br>
which hinders sufficient dispersion. Meanwhile, since the<br>
particles (B) carry the calcium hydrogen phosphate in the<br>
treatment agent of the present invention, the treatment agent<br>
is excellent in dispersibility and can be efficiently mixed with<br>
the fluorine-containing soil.<br>
[0055]<br>
 <br>
The fluorine-insolubilizing treatment method preferably<br>
includes, for example, a step of mixing the calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate dihydrate (A) and the particles (B) to produce the<br>
treatment agent, a step of adding the treatment agent to a<br>
fluorine-containing soil, and a step of mixing the added<br>
treatment agent and the fluorine-containing soil.<br>
[0056]<br>
The production method of the treatment agent by mixing<br>
the calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (A) and the particles<br>
(B) is not particularly limited, and may include, for example,<br>
a method using the tilting gravity mixer, or the like.<br>
[0057]<br>
The fluorine elution amount from the fluorine-containing<br>
soil is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, 0.1<br>
mg/L or more, and may further be 0.8 mg/L or more.<br>
[0058]<br>
The soil may be preferably, for example, earth or sludge.<br>
[0059]<br>
The earth is not particularly limited as long as it is<br>
one generally called earth. Any of sandy soil, sandy loam, loam,<br>
clay loam, clay soil, and the like can be used. Other examples<br>
of the earth include earth prepared by appropriately mixing and<br>
adjusting ground aqueous rocks, ground pumice rocks, volcanic<br>
ash soils, and the like. Moreover, earth used as a soil for<br>
horticulture and the like may be used as well.<br>
[0060]<br>
Examples of the sludge include a solid formed by<br>
coagulation of organic final products which have been generated<br>
in the process of sewage disposal treatment or in the process<br>
of industrial effluent treatment. The solid is also called a<br>
sludge. Other examples of the sludge include an activated<br>
sludge, that is an agglomeration of microorganisms resulting<br>
from water treatment with microbial community such as aerobic<br>
bacteria.<br>
 <br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0061]<br>
Since the treatment agent of the present invention has<br>
the aforementioned structure, it can simply and<br>
cost-efficiently produce a treated water in which fluorine has<br>
been sufficiently removed, and also can treat a soil in a manner<br>
that the fluorine elution amount of the treated soil is 0.8 mg/L<br>
or less of the soil environmental standards.<br>

apparatus in Example 1.<br>

apparatus in Comparative Example 1.<br>
MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0063]<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail<br>
with reference to examples; however, the present invention is<br>
not limited to the examples.<br>
[0064]<br>
(Example 1)<br>
A tilting gravity mixer (capacity: 110 L) was charged with<br>
rapid filtration sand (product of Tohkemy Corporation,<br>
standardized by "Japan Water Works Association Standard, JWWA<br>
A103-l:2004 standardized product, effective diameter: 0.6 mm,<br>
uniformity coefficient: at most 1.5, maximum diameter: at most<br>
2.8 mm, minimum diameter: at least 0.3 mm"), and calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate powder (product of Taihei Chemical<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd., "average particle diameter: 54 µm"<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as DCPD) ) , at a mass ratio of 90 parts<br>
by mass of the rapid filtration sand and 10 parts by mass of<br>
the DCPD for 100 parts by mass in total, followed by mixing for<br>
three minutes.<br>
 <br>
[0065]<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing the filtration<br>
apparatus in Example 1. As shown in Fig. 1, a mixture 2 of the<br>
rapid filtration sand and the DCPD obtained by the foregoing<br>
mixture and a glass wool 3 were charged in a glass column casing<br>
1 (10 cm) so that a filtration apparatus 5 was prepared.<br>
Next, a fluorine-containing water to be treated was<br>
poured at a flow rate of 50 ml/min into a tube 6 that was<br>
communicated with an upper portion of the filtration apparatus<br>
5, and thereby a treated water was obtained from a tube 7<br>
connected to a lower portion of the apparatus. As shown in Fig.<br>
1, the fluorine-containing water to be treated 4 is treated by<br>
permeation through the mixture 2 in the column casing 1. In<br>
this Example, the permeability of the mixture 2 was evaluated<br>
based on changes in the water level of a water surface 8. Table<br>
1 shows the flow rate, fluorine concentration, and water level<br>
of the water to be treated, and the flow rate and fluorine<br>
concentration of the treated water. The fluorine<br>
concentration of the fluorine-containing water and the treated<br>
water was measured by a method according to JIS K0102.<br>
[0066]<br>
[Table 1]<br>
 <br>
The fluorine concentration of the treated water was<br>
maintained below the environmental standards after 120 days<br>
 <br>
from the beginning of permeation. The water level did not<br>
change 120 days after the beginning of permeation. That is,<br>
the permeability did not change.<br>
[0068]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
A tilting gravity mixer (capacity: 110 L) was charged with<br>
ordinary sand for mortar, concrete, and the like (effective<br>
diameter: 0.1 to 5 mm, maximum diameter: more than 3.0 mm, at<br>
most 5.0 mm) used for civil engineering and construction<br>
purposes, and DCPD, at a mass ratio of 90 parts by mass of the<br>
sand and 10 parts by mass of the DCPD for 100 parts by mass in<br>
total, followed by mixing for three minutes.<br>
[0069]<br>
In the same manner as in Example 1, the following steps<br>
were performed: charging the resulting mixture into a glass<br>
column casing, preparing a filtration apparatus, pouring a<br>
fluorine-containing water to be treated from the upper portion<br>
of the filtration apparatus, evaluating the permeability, and<br>
measuring the fluorine concentration. Table 2 shows the<br>
result.<br>
[0070]<br>
[Table 2]<br>
 <br>
Comparison between the result of Example 1 and that of<br>
Example 2 shows that superior permeability is achieved in the<br>
case where the DCPD is carried by the rapid filtration sand to<br>
the case where the DCPD is carried by the ordinary sand. The<br>
results reveal that the diameter of the particles (B)<br>
functioning as a carrier is a key factor for improving the<br>
permeability. Moreover, an attention should be paid on the fact<br>
 <br>
that the rapid filtration sand contains a larger amount of water<br>
than the ordinary sand. However, in the inventors' experiments,<br>
when ordinary sand which had been soaked in pure water was mixed<br>
with the DCPD, partial coagulations of the DCPD were observed.<br>
[0072]<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
An experiment was performed in the same manner as in<br>
Example 1, except that DCPD alone was used instead of the mixture<br>
of the rapid filtration sand and the DCPD. As shown in Fig.<br>
2, DCPD 9 and the glass wool 3 were charged in the glass column<br>
casing 1 ( 10 cm) so that a filtration apparatus 5a was prepared.<br>
The DCPD was the same as that used in Example 1.<br>
Next, a fluorine-containing water to be treated was<br>
poured at a flow rate of 50 ml/min from a tube 6 communicated<br>
with an upper portion of the apparatus, and shortly after the<br>
pouring, the water surface 8 of the fluorine-containing water<br>
to be treated elevated to the upper surface of the apparatus.<br>
Thus, a treated water was not obtained. Table 3 shows the flow<br>
rate, fluorine concentration, and water level of the water to<br>
be treated, and the flow rate and fluorine concentration of the<br>
treated water. As the treated water was not obtained, the<br>
fluorine concentration of the treated water was not measured.<br>
[0073]<br>
[Table 3]<br>
 <br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
A tilting gravity mixer (capacity: 110 L) was charged with<br>
glass and resin beads (effective diameter: 2 to 4 mm) generally<br>
used for handicraft and decoration, and DCPD, at a mass ratio<br>
of 90 parts by mass of the beads and 10 parts by mass of the<br>
 <br>
DCPD for 100 parts by mass in total, followed by mixing for three<br>
minutes.<br>
[0075]<br>
A glass column casing was filled with the resulting<br>
mixture in the same manner as in Example 1 so that a filtration<br>
apparatus was prepared. Upon pouring a fluorine-containing<br>
water to be treated from an upper portion of the filtration<br>
apparatus, beads began floating, and the treated water in the<br>
upper portion of the filtration apparatus became cloudy. The<br>
permeability was evaluated, and the fluorine concentration was<br>
measured in the same manner as in Example 1. Table 4 shows the<br>
results. The results reveal that the DCPD is not sufficiently<br>
carried by the beads.<br>
[0076]<br>
[Table 4]<br>
 <br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0077]<br>
The treatment agent of the present invention has the<br>
structure mentioned earlier, and thus can be preferably used<br>
in the fields where fluorine-containing water or<br>
fluorine-containing soil is generated, such as electroplating<br>
industry, semiconductor producing industry, electronic valve<br>
producing industry, and glass industry.<br>
