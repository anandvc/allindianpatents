FORSKNINGSCENTER RIS0,  of Frederiksborgvej  399,  P.O.Box 49, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and<br>
the manner in which it is to be performed:                                       GRANTED<br>
30-11-2005<br>
ORIGINAL 452/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
The invention relates to an electronically conducting or mixed ionic and electroni¬cally conducting material comprising at least two phases.<br>
Technical Field<br>
Such a material may for instance be in the form of a non-stoichiometric oxide where undesired p02 driven volume changes of the main phase is counterbalanced by contraction/expansion of one or more secondary phase(s) or by gradual solu¬tion/dissolution of the secondary phase in/from the mam phase. Applying this princi¬ple ("counterbalancing-two-phase-principle") it is .possible to achieve improved overall dimensional stability relatively to that of the main phase alone, whilst main¬taining good transport properties or alternatively to improve transport properties whilst maintaining the maximum tolerable volume change in a given technological application.<br>
The principle of the invention is generally applicable to non-stoichiometric oxides. In the following the group of alkaline earth doped lanthanum chromites is used as material Example. Lanthanum chromites are of the types III-III, where III indicates the valence. The valence seems to be of importance for the sensitivity to p02 with regard to volume change.<br>
Alkaline earth doped lanthanum chromites, La1-XMaxFe1-Y-ZMgzVy+rO3+5, Ma = Ca, Sr, Ba and Mb = Mg exhibit good thermodynamic stability and electronic conductivity at high temperatures (800- 1000°C). The conductivity increases with the doping con¬centration (Meadowcroft, D.B., Brit. J. Phys. (J. Phys. D), ser. 2, Vol 2, 1225-1233, (1969)). Due to the high conductivity and the excellent stability these materials have a range of interesting technological applications in high temperature devices.<br><br>
These include interconnector material in (SOFC) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, heating     elements and electrodes in sensors and SOFC.<br>
The crystal structure of alkaline earth doped lanthanum chromites is perovskite type, AB03, but symmetry and atom positions depend on doping level, doping ion and temperature. For Example, La1-xSrxCrO3-6 exhibits a phase change from orthorhombic to rhombohedral at low temperature. For pure LaCr03 the transition temperature is about 290°C (Diagrams 4397 and 5202 in: "Phase Diagrams for Ceramists" Vol III and Vol IV. Rom, R. S. et, al. and Levin, E.M. The American Ceramic Society, Ohio.). Doping with calcium increases transition temperature but reduces the volu¬metric change associated with the phase transition (Sakai, N., et al., Solid State Ionics, [40/41], 394-397, (1990)). Doping with strontium reduces the transition temperature (Khattak et al., "Structural Studies of the (La, Sr)Cr03 System", Materi¬als Research Bulletin, 12, 1977). For La0-8Sr0.2CrO3-5 the transition temperature is below room temperature. This is advantageous, as the volume change associated with the phase transition is generally unwanted. Hence, high doping levels are often preferred.<br>
For use in solid oxide fuel cells the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the interconnector must be close to that of the structural element of the system to prevent building up stress at the interfaces on thermal cycling. For electrolyte supported systems this element is usually yttrium-stabilised zirconia (YSZ), which has a TEC of 10.8 - 11.0 x10-6K-1(P.H. Larsen et al., "Stacking of planar SOFCs", in Proceed¬ings 4. Int. Symp. on SOFC. Eds. M. Dokiya et al.). For anode supported systems the structural element is usually a YSZ/Ni cermet with a TEC about 12 x 10-6K-1 (Mori, M, et al., "Thermal Expansion of Nickel-Zirconia Anodes in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells During Fabrication and Operation", Journal of the Electrochemical Soci¬ety, 145, 4, 1998). It has been shown in literature that varying doping level of alka¬line earth element as well as co-doping with other elements, such as titanium, alu-minium, nickel or cobalt may modify the TEC for perovskites of doped lanthanum<br><br>
  chromites (Hiei, Y, et al., "Controlling Thermal Expansion Behaviour of Sr-Doped   Lanthanum Chromites with Al and Co for SOFC Separator" in Proceedings of the Third European Solid Ocide Fuel Cell Forum, Nantes. Ed.: Stevens, P, European Fuel Cell Forum, 1998). As the TEC for the materials in this patent is mainly deter¬mined by the properties of the main phase the TEC of the materials according to this patent should correspondingly be modifiable by the same additives.<br>
Alkaline earth doped lanthanum chromites expand when reduced at a constant, high temperature. This expansion is due to the simultaneous formation of oxygen vacan¬cies and the decrease in the oxidation state of the chromium ion from +4 to +3. In an SOFC the interconnector separates the fuel from the oxidant. The interconnector material is exposed to different oxygen partial pressures regimes at either side. If the material has a high p03 driven volume change this may result in formation of cracks or a delamination between interconnect and electrodes. Such failure modes may be catastrophic for the stack performance. Modelling has indicated that the p02 driven volume change should be less than 0.05% linear change in flat plate design SOFC to prevent failing of the material (Hendriksen, P. V. et al. ,'Lattice expansion in¬duced strains in solid oxide fuel cell stacks and their significance for stack integrity' in "High Temperature Electrochemistry: Ceramics and Metals" Poulsen, F.W. et al (eds.). 17th Ris0 International Symposium on Materials Science 1996).<br>
In summary, high doping level of an alkaline earth element is desired in the alkaline earth doped lanthanum chromite system to provide a high conductivity, provide a thermal expansion to match the structural element and to suppress the transformation temperature below room temperature.<br>
The problem of the pO2 driven volume change described above for the specific Example of an acceptor doped lanthanum chromite is in fact a very general one. All extrinsic electronic conductors and mixed ionic and electronic conductors are prone to such problems.        <br><br>
A change in oxidation state of the cations in the lattice is associated with a change of    size of the ions and thus in general with a change in unit cell volume. Thus, if the required p02 window of operation for a specific technological application of a mate¬rial includes the p02 interval, where the cations of the material may change oxidation state the material will experience volume changes. These volume changes may or may not be problematic, depending on the conditions (important conditions being magnitude of the volume change, the mechanical boundary conditions, and the me¬chanical strength of the material.) In all applications where high elecronic conductiv¬ity is required, one of the elements must be present in multiple oxidation states. As the minority species (of the different oxidation states) limits the conductivity, the minority species should be present in a significant amount. The larger the required p02 interval of operation, the more difficult it becomes to fulfil the requirement of coexistence of multiple oxidation states (and significant amount of the minority species) without experiencing a change in their relative concentration over the p02 interval, which causes the undesired volume change.<br>
For all non-stoichiometric oxides, such as perovskites, flourites, pyrochlors, Brownmillerites and Ruddlesden-Popper crystal systems, where transport properties are important, the p02 driven volume change will be present potentially posing a problem.<br><br>
Ce(Sm)02 is a specific Example of a mixed electronic and ionic conducting flourite. When the oxygen partial pressure is reduced this material will expand sirnilarly to what is observed in La(Sr)Cr03 (H. M. Williams et al. In: Proceedings of the 2nd European Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Forum. Ed.: B. Thorstensen, 783-792, 2, 1996). Modification of the composition to introduce a suitable secondary phase may solve the expansion problem.<br>
For the chosen material example system, the p02 driven volume changes may, as demonstrated in the following, be partly counterbalanced by introducing vanadium<br><br>
Vanadium has been utilised as a sintering agent for chromites by assisting the liquid phase sintering. This effect is especially profound for doping levels of 1- 3 % (Carte-r, D., WO 95/05685), which includes LaxCayCr1-zVzO3 for x + y 
According to the same principle, vanadium has also been added as sintering aid in the form of Sr3(VO4)2 to LaI-xSRXCRO3 compounds (Simner, S.P., Solid State Ionics [128], 53-63, 2000). However, adding of 5-10 wt-% Sr3(VO4)2 to Lao.85Sro.15CrO3 did not improve the pO2 driven volume change. Assuming Sr3(VO4)2 enters into the perovskite phase, AB03, addition of Sr3(V04)2 leads to A site excess, contrary to the present invention, where an excess of B-sites is favourable. Furthermore, an excess of A-sites may lead to formation of A-oxides or hydroxides which may lead to disin¬tegration of the material.<br>
Another Example of using additive to enhance liquid phase sintering is described in WO 92/12929 (Cipollini, N.E, WO 92/12929). The additive is Bi203. WO 92/12929 includes Ca- and Mg-doped lanthanum chromites. Effects on the p02 driven volume change has not been reported.<br>
Systems including multiple phases have been utilised in interconnectors as described in WO 98/40921 (Diekmann, U., WO 98/40921), where an inert glass ceramic phase was introduced. However, contrary to the present invention the secondary phases neither influence the redox properties of the system nor do the phases interact chemi¬cally.<br><br><br>
The purpose of the invention is to provide a material of the above-mentioned type and which is more sturdy than hitherto known. Specifically for interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells this is of importance.<br>
The secondary phases are usually formed by addition or doping with an element above the solubility limit, where single-phase solid solutions cannot be formed. A secondary phase may work through a change in title solubility of the elements of the secondary phases with the oxygen partial pressure (yielding a precipita-tion/reabsorbtion effect), through a phase transition with the oxygen partial pressure or by a combination of a change in solubility and a phase transition. For all cases, it is a demand that the density changes with the oxygen partial pressure. If an expan¬sion of the main phase is counterbalanced, the secondary phases should change to a more dense modification. If a contraction of the main phase is counterbalanced, the secondary phases should change to fewer dense modifications.<br>
The materials according to the invention are characterised by having one or more secondary phases that counterbalance the p02 driven volume change of the main phase during reduction and consists of a main phase of non-stoichiometric oxide of for instance alkaline earth doped lanthanum chromite (a material of the type lII-III) and one or more secondary phases, which change phase in the oxygen partial pres¬sure range of the application, said secondary phases for instance consisting of combi¬nations of V, Sr, La or Cr. During reduction the secondary phase(s) will either decompose and be incorporated into the main phase or form another phase with different density - possibly of the perovskite type. Since the perovskite phase has a higher packing density of the ions than most other phases the disappearance of non-perovskite secondary phases will lead to a contraction by reduction of the oxygen partial pressure.<br><br><br>
According to the invention the main phase may be a perovskite phase or a fiourit     phase.<br>
According to the invention the secondary phase may contain one or more of the elements Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Bi, Sb, Sn and Pb.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Examples:<br>
In the following Examples, the nominal compositions of the materials are for simplic¬ity expressed as chemical formulas. There lies no postulate of a single phase material behind this sotation.<br>
The perovskite structure represents a dense packing of the ions with no room for interstitial oxygen ions. Therefore '+S' in the formulas for the materials indicate formation of other, less dense phases than the perovskite rather than interstitial oxygen ions. The multi-phase system is generated directly without mixing of sepa¬rately prepared ceramic powders.<br>
The multi-phase systems consisting of V, Sr, La and Cr exhibit good TEC match to<br>
&gt;<br>
YSZ. Furthermore, the secondary phases of the above-mentioned types are relatively well conducting and the presence of small amounts of these phases is therefore not detrimental to the overall conductivity of the material.<br>
In general, the use of a multi-phase system rather than a single-phase system in¬creases the degrees of freedom and provides additional means for optimising the properties of the material.<br><br>
In the introduction a design criterion of less than 0.05 % linear isotherm expansion -   was given (Hendriksen, P. V, et al., "Lattice expansion induced strains in solid oxide fuel cell stacks and their significance for stack integrity" in "High Temperature Electrochemistry: Ceramics and Metals" Poulsen, F. W. et al (eds.). 17th Ris0 inter-' national Symposium on Materials Science 1996). This value refers to single phase chromite interconnects exhibiting a p02 driven volume change by reduction. The multi-phase systems exhibit contraction at slightly reducing conditions and expansion on strongly reducing conditions (see below). In a solid oxide fuel cell of flat plate design the interconnector is kept flat, and the p02 driven volume change will result in internal stresses in the interconnector. The highest tensile stress is on the surface at the air side of the single phase interconnector contrary to the present invention where the small contraction between an oxygen partial pressure of about 0.2 atm and    about 10'3 atm will tend to move the point of maximum tensile stress inward from the surface. If the contraction is sufficiently high compared to the expansion at low oxygen partial pressure, the air side surface may even experience a compression. Since cracks are usually initiated from imperfections at the surface, this situation is highly desirable and reduces the risk of failure during operating conditions in a solid oxide fuel cell.<br>
A fair comparison between the properties of the here developed materials and the state of the art materials must be made between materials of similar conductivity. Mori et al. (Mori, M., Yamamoto, T., Itoh and H., Watanabe, Journal of Materials Science, 32, 2423 - 2431, 1997) have measured the conductivity of La0.8Sr0.2CrO3-8 as a function of oxygen partial pressure and also when the material is placed in a p02 gradient The conductivity measured in the gradient equals the conductivity measured at the low p02indicating that effectively all the material in the sample is in a reduced form. This shows that as to applications, such as SOFC interconnects, where the material is placed in a p02 gradient, the important property is the conductivity at a low p02. The conductivity at pO2   1036.5 aim. (1000°C) for the developed materials is about     10 S/cm. To achieve a comparable conductivity for a purely Sr-doped (single-phase) material one would need a degree of doping of approximately 15 %. The p02 driven volume change of La0.85Sr0.15CrO3-8 at p02 " 10-16.5 atm. (1000°C) is about 0.13 % linear change. The p02 driven volume change on the same conditions for die devel¬oped two-phase materials is between +0.02 % linear change and -0.055 % linear change (samples of compositions 109508 and 259016, respectively). Introduction of suitable secondary phases thus reduces the dimension change to about a third of the one for the single-phase material of comparable conductivity.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Experimental evidences that secondary phases appear and are re-absorbed due to changes in partial pressure of oxygen.<br>
High temperature X-ray powder diffraction of a sintered sample with composition 209016 was measured in air and reducing atmosphere (p02 = 6x10-17atm.) at 1000-°C by means of a STOE Powder Diffractometer. In Fig 1, the diffraction patterns are illustrated. A comparison of the two patterns shows that the amount of secondary phase (non-perovsldte) decreases significantly when the sample is reduced. This is evident considering the secondary phase peaks at 26 = 24.0°, 25.5°, 27.1° and 29.1 °, that disappear due to reduction.<br>
The active secondary phases may be rich in vanadium and strontium or lanthanum and may typically be of the type Ae(La)V(Tm)04-8 or Ln(Sr)V(Tm)04-8.<br>
Considering again a sample with composition 209016, it is observed that in Fig 2 the conductivity increases when the sample is reduced from air to about p02 ==10" 13atm and conductivity slightly decreases at more reducing conditions. The initial increase in conductivity may be explained by the dissolution of the strontium rich<br><br>
secondary phases into the perovskite phase leading to an increase in the effective    doping level of strontium in the perovskite and thereby an increase in the concentra¬tion of Cr IV, which determines the conduction. The subsequent decrease is due to reduction of chromium 4+ to chromium 3+ in the perovskite phase. Conventional single-phase chromites do not exhibit the described increase in conductivity during reduction but only the decrease due to the chromium reduction (Yasuda, I., et al.. J. Electrocnem. Soc, [140], 6, 1699-1704, (1993)).<br>
In Fig 3, the relative conductivity of a sample with composition 109508 is plotted vs. time after a change in partial pressure of oxygen. It is observed that the experiment conducted in reducing atmosphere reaches a new equilibrium within 6-8 hours, whereas for the experiment involving both reducing and oxidising atmosphere con¬ductivity changes over several days. For the latter experiment, the conductivity seems to change in two stages. This further indicates that segregation of secondary phases is involved. The segregation of secondary phases takes place via cation diffusion and a conductivity response to this is therefore much slower than the response from changes in cation oxidation states controlled by oxygen diffusion-Variations in oxygen content of the 209016 were investigated by cyclic voltametry at 1000oC (see Fig 4). It was observed that the redox process consists of several steps, as several peaks appear by oxidation and reduction sweeps. Reduction and oxidation peaks are not symmetrical. This indicates that die formation of phases may depend on a nucleation process. Quantification of the peaks indicates that die oxygen removal between 0.03 -&gt; - 0.2V by reduction correspond to a change in oxidation state of 1 of the excess cation ([Cr]+[V]-1). The two peaks at about -0.66 and -0.82 are due to changes in oxidation states associated with absorption into the peiovskke phase or to the formation of other secondary phases. By oxidation, the peaks at about -0.7 -&gt;<br>
- 0.38V are probably related to the formation of secondary phases. Oxygen corre¬sponding to the removal between 0.03 -&gt; - 0.2V by reduction is incorporated during<br><br>
the resting time at high oxygen partial pressure.<br>
Example 2:<br>
A nominal composition 209016 was used.<br>
The materials specified in the Examples were prepared by the glycine/nitrate powder synthesis method (Chick, L.A., Bates, J.L., Pederson, L.R., and Kissinger, H.E. Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. The Elec¬trochemical. Society, Proceedings Vol. 89-11, 1998. p. 170-187) as exemplified in the following:<br>
Aqueous solutions of Sr(N03)2 (0.1621g Sr/g solution) denoted Sr-solution, La(N03)3,6H30 (0.1986g La/g solution) denoted La-solution and Cr(N03)3,9H20 (0.08786g Cr/g solution) denoted Cr-solution were prepared and calibrated by heat¬ing to 850 CC for 8h and measuring the weight of residual oxide.<br>
Vanadium was stabilised in aqueous solution by complexing with citric acid: 15.003-9g V205 and 6L5g citric acid were dissolved in 184.2g H20 by heating. This resulted in a solution with a concentration of 0.02874g V/g solution. This solution is denoted V-solution,<br>
The material was prepared from 55.959g La solution, 10.810g Sr solution, 53.263g Cr solution, 17.727g V solution and 22.664g glycine.<br>
The aqueous solutions of metal nitrates were mixed to the desired stoichiometry. Glycine was dissolved in the mixture to give a concentration of 0.548 moles of glycine pr. mole nitrate-group. During heating, water was removed from the solu¬tion by evaporation to form a gel. By further heating, the gel ignites and burns to form a ceramic nano-powder. The powder is collected and calcined for 2 hours at<br><br>
1000°C.<br>
Other synthesis methods, such as the mixed oxide route (solid state reaction between oxides and carbonates), the Pechini method (Pechini, M.P., US Patent 3,330697 (1967)) or sol-gel synthesis (Chen, C.H., Kruidhof, H., Bouwmeester, H.J.M. and Burggraaf, A.J. Materials Science and Engineering B39 (1996) 129-132) are also suitable.<br>
Calcined powder was pre-pressed uniaxially at about lOOOkg/crn2 followed by iso-static pressing at about 3300kg/cnr. The pressed samples were placed in alumina crucibles and sintered in air at 1520°C for 5 hours. Table 1 contains a list of the prepared samples and geometrical densities.<br>

159016	15	90	16	6.19<br>
159508	15	95	8	6.38<br>

Conductivity was measured at temperatures from 800°C to 1000°C in air. The conductivity varied from 4.23S/cm at 800°C to 5.69S/cm 1000°C. At 1000°C, the conductivity was measured in oxygen partial pressures from 0.21 arm. to 10-17 atm. In Kg 2, the conductivity is plotted vs. oxygen partial pressure. The conductivity at 10-16atm is 10.8 S/cm.<br>
It was demonstrated that the same conductivity may be obtained in air after multiple redox-cycles, i.e. the pO2 driven solution/precipitation reactions are reversible.<br><br>
The thermal expansion was measured by dilatometry in air between 25°C and 1000-   °C with a heating rate of 5°C/rnin. In Fig 5, the expansion vs. temperature is plot¬ted. The thermal expansion coefficient, TEC, was 11.1x10-6K-1.<br>
The dilatometry measurements indicate that there are no phase transitions in the main phase as no abrupt contraction is observed in Fig 5. Differential Scanning Calorime-try, DSC, further confirmed this as no endotherm was observed between room tem¬perature and 1000°C (see Fig 6). However, DSC indicated a phase transition at about 1004°C. Dilatometry measurements were only performed up to 1000°C, and the high temperature transition was not observed.<br>
The p02 driven volume change was measured by dilatometry at 1000°C for oxygen partial pressure between 0.21 atm. and 10-17atm. In Fig 7, the expansion is plotted vs. oxygen partial pressure at 1000°C. The p02 driven volume change from air to 10-16 atm corresponded to about -i-0.05 % linear change. Note that a contraction takes place during mild reduction. In Fig 7, it can be observed that the contraction was greatest for oxygen partial pressures around 10-14 10-15 atm. Under these conditions, the p02 driven volume change corresponded to about +0.11 % linear change.<br>
Thermogravimetry was measured at 1000°C with an oxygen partial pressure be¬tween 0.21 atm and 10-17 atm. (see Fig 8). The weight loss on reduction is due to loss of oxygen when the oxidation states of cations are decreased in some cases followed by changes in phase distribution. Vanadium is expected to be in oxidation state +4 within the perovskite. The loss of oxygen indicated that some of the vanadium chang¬ed oxidation state during the reduction.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A nominal composition 159016 was used.<br><br>
The material was prepared from 59.451g La-solution, 8.109g Sr-soiution, 53.258g    Cr-solution, 17.724g V-solution and 22.837g glycine. The mixture was reacted, calcined and sintered as described in Example 2.<br>
The conductivity varied from 6.05 S/cm at 800°C to 6.79 S/cm 1000° in air. In Fig 2, conductivity at 1000°C is plotted vs. oxygen partial pressure. The conductivity at 10-16atm is estimated to 12.2 S/cm.<br>
The thermal expansion coefficient, TEC, was measured in air between 25 °C and 1000°C by dilatometry. The thermal expansion coefficient was 10.9xl0-6K-1<br>
The dilatometry indicated a phase transition at about 90oC in the main phase (cf Fig 5).<br>
The p02 driven volume change was measured at 1000°C for oxygen partial pressure between 0.21 arm. and 10-17 atm. In Fig 7, the expansion is plotted vs. oxygen partial pressure at 1000°C. The p02 driven volume change from air to 10-16atm was about -?-0.042% linear change.<br>
Example 4:<br>
A nominal composition 109508 was used.<br>
The material was prepared from 62.951g La solution, 5.405g Sr solution, 56.231g CR solution, 8.862g V solution and 23.657g glycine. The rnixture was reacted, calcined and sintered as described in Example 2.<br>
Experimental results are stated in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Table 2: Summary of experimental results.<br><br>
* Phase transition at 80 - 100°C. ** Phase transition at about 90°C.<br>
Conductivity tests over several oxidation cycles indicate that conductivity during reducing conditions is highly reproducible, and that conductivity under oxidising conditions where the slow evolution of secondary phases takes place, remains higher than 7.8S/cm.<br>
Example 5:<br>
A nominal composition 159508 was used.<br>
The material was prepared from 59.454g La solution, 8.105g Sr solution, 56.226g Cr solution, 8.869g V solution and 23.454g glycine. The mixture was reacted, calcined and sintered as described in Example 2.<br>
Experimental results are stated in Table 2.<br>
Example 6:<br>
A mominal composition 259016 was used.<br><br>
The material was prepared from 52.45Ig La solution, 13.518g Sr solution, 53.264g Cr solution, 17.724g V solution and 22.429g glycine. The mixture was reacted, calcined and sintered as described in Example 2.<br>
Experimental results are stated in Table 2.<br>
Example 7:<br>
Tailoring of properties.<br>
By analysing the results in Fig 7, it may be observed that the contraction between air and slightly reducing conditions (about 1015 atm for samples with compositions 209016, and 159016, and about 10*12 atm for samples with compositions 109508 and 159508) increases with increasing vanadium content Furthermore, the p02 driven volume change from the most contracted state increases with increasing strontium content. It should therefore be possible to optimise the composition to the desired expansion behaviour. Specifically, it should be possible to produce a material with zero expansion. According to Table 2, mis should hold between 8-16 site-% vana¬dium. From Fig 2 it may be concluded that the optimisation of expansion properties may be performed without deteriorating the conductivity of the material.<br>
Example 8:<br>
Generalisation of the A-site cation in the perovskite system<br>
The problem of pO2 driven volume change described above for the specific Example of acceptor doped lanthanum chromite is in fact a very general one. All extrinsic electronic conductors and mixed ionic and electronic conductors axe prone to such, problems. One Example of such materials is the AB03 perovskites.<br><br><br>
The perovskite structure provides wide possibilities for variation of the A and the B cation as well as the doping ion of the main phase in the multi-phase system. The ionic radius of the A-site cation should be close to that of oxygen. The A-site compo¬sitions, which are likely to form systems equivalent to the La(Sr)Cr(V)03-system, may for instance be one element or a combination of elements belonging to the lanthanides including Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu, the alkaline elements including Na and K, the alkaline earth elements including Ca, ST and Ba as well as selected transition elements including La and Y.<br>
The multi-phase system may for instance have a nominal composition LOCr1-yVy+r03:t6, where LO is chosen according to the list of elements above. An Example of this is the system Nd0.8Sr0.2Cr0..95V0.103±b. Neodymium may take part in the forma¬tion of the secondary phases in a modification of NdVOx.<br>
Example 9:<br>
Generalisation of the B-site cation in the perovskite system<br>
The B-site cation in the perovskite AB03 system may be changed by a number of elements to form a main phase capable of making a multi-phase system with active secondary phase. The B-site may for instance be one or a combination of elements belonging to the transition metals, such as Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Hf, Ta, W, Re and Os as well as Mg, Al, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, Pb, Bi and Sb.<br>
An Example of a multi-phase system composed of   this series is La1-xSrxFe1-y-<br><br>
It is very likely that the elements V, Nb, Ta, Bi, Sb, Mn, Fe, Co, Ti, Cr, Mo, W, Sn and Pb will be active in formation of secondary phases with the desired proper¬ties, since they are likely to exist in higher oxidation states than 3+ as well as in oxidation state 3+. Moreover, most of the elements mentioned in Example 9 should be capable of forming of secondary phases, which exhibit varying solubility with a change in the oxygen partial pressure in the right main phase.<br>
