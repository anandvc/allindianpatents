				<td>A POLYPEPTIDE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention was made in part with Government support from the Medical Research Service of the Veterans Affairs Department. The Government has certain rights in this application.<br>
The present invention relates to novel synthetic peptides which inhibit the release of growth hormone from the pituitary in mammals, and to therapeutic compositions containing these novel peptides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Growth Hormone ("GH") is a peptide having 191 arnino acids which stimulates the production of numerous different growth factors, e.g. insulin-Tike growth factor I (IGF-I) and so promotes growth of numerous tissues (skeleton, connective tissue, muscte and viscera) and physiological activities (raising nucleic acid and protein synthesis and lipolysis, but lowering urea secretion).<br>
Release of GH is under the control of releasing and inhibiting factors secreted by the hypothalamus. The primary releasing factor is growth hormone releasing hormone ("GH-RH"); human growth hormone-releasing hormone ("hGH-RH") is a peptide having 44 amino acids. The novel peptides of The present invention relate to analogues of hGH-RH having only residues 1 through 29 ("hGH-RH(1-29)NH2"), i.e., to analogues of the peptide which has the amino acid sequence:<br>
Tyr-Ala-Asp-Ala-lle5-Phe-Thr-Asn-Ser-Tyr10-Arg-Lys-Val-Leu-Gly15-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ala-Arg20-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Asp25-lle-Met-Ser-Arg29-NH2,<br>
GH has been implicated in several diseases. One disease in which GH is involved is acromegaly, in which excessive levels of GH are present.The <br>
abnormally enlarged facial and extremity bones of this disease can be treated by administering a GH-RH antagonist.<br>
Further diseases involving GH are diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy. The damage to the retina and kidneys respectively in these diseases, believed to be due to GH, results in blindness or reduction in kidney function. This damage can be prevented or slowed by administration of an effective GH-RH antagonist.<br>
However, the main applications of GH-RH antagonists would be in the field of cancer (A.V.Schally et al, in Growth Hormone Secretagoues in Clinical Practice, eds. Bercu, B.B. &amp; Walker, R.F., Dekker, New York, pp. 145-162, 1998). IGF-I and -II are potent mitogens for various cancers. By suppressing GH secretion, GH-RH antagonists decreases the synthesis of IGF-I in the liver and other tissues. GH-RH antagonists also reduce the autocrine arid jiaracrine production of IGF-I and/or IGF-II by various tumors. In several experimental cancers, treatment with antagonists of GH-RH produces a reduction in IGF-I and -II. concomitant to inhibition of tumor growth.<br>
In an effort to intervene in these disease and other conditions, some investigators have attempted to control GH levels by using somatostatin, one inhibitor of GH release. However, somatostatin, if administered alone, does not suppress GH or IGF-I levels to a desired degree. If administered in combination with a GH-RH antagonist, somatostatin would improve suppression of IGF-I levels much better.<br>
Scientists have investigated various modifications of GH-RH to elucidate the relationship of the structure of GH-RH to its activity in an effort to provide synthetic congeners with improved agonistic or antagonistic properties. Thus, it was early established that GH-RH fragment comprising<br>
residues 1 to 29, or GH-RH(1-29), is the minimum sequence necessary for biological activity. This fragment retains 50% or more of the potency of native GH-RH.<br>
The first described GH-RH antagonist, |Ac-Tyr',D-Arg2)hGH-RH(1-29)NH2, which is generally termed as the "standard antagonist" in the literature, was found to prevent the activation of rat anterior pituitary adenylate cyclase by hGH-RH(1-29)NH.. The same peptide blocked the action of GH-RH on its receptors in the pituitary and hypothalamus, and inhibited the pulsatile growth hormone secretion.<br>
A considerable number of patents and articles in the open literature disclose analogs of GH-RH which either act as agonists of GH-RH (i.e. act to stimulate the release of GH) or as antagonists of GH-RH (i.e. act to inhibit the release of GH). Most of these peptides are derived from the GH-RH(1-29) pepttde sequence, with specific structural modifications which account for their enhanced agonistic or antagonistic properties.<br>
Thus, US Patent 4,659,693 discloses GH-RH antagonistic analogs which gontaincertain N,N'-dialkyl-omega-guanidino alpha-amino acvl residues in position 2 of the GH-RHCI-29) sequence.<br>
Published application WO 91/16923 reviews earlier attempts to alter the secondary structure of hGH-RH by modifying its amino acid sequence. These earlier attempts include: replacing Tyr1, Ala2, Asp3 or Asn8 with their D-isomers; replacing AsnH with L- or D-Ser, D-Arg, Asn, Thr, Gin or D-Lys; replacing Ser" with Ala to enhance amphiphilicity of the region; and replacing Gly16" with Ala or Aib. When Rz in the analogs is D-Arg, and R", R", and R1' are substituted as indicated above, antagonistic activity is said to result. These antagonistic peptides are said to be suitable for administration as pharmaceutical compositions to treat conditions associated with<br>
excessive levels of GH. e.g., acromegaly.<br>
The antagonistic activity of the hGH-RH analogue "[Ser3-?{CH2,-NH]-Tyr10!hGH-RH(1-29)" of US Patent 5,084,555 was said to result from the pseudopeptide bond (i.e.. a peptide bond reduced to a {CH2-NH} linkage) between the R: and R10 residues. However, the antagonistic properties of |Ser3-?{CH2,-NH}-Tyr10|hGH-RH( 1-29) were said to be.inferior to the standard antagonist, IN-Ac-Tyr1, D-Arg2lGH-RH(1-29)-NH2.<br>
US Patent 5,550,212, and US Patent Application 08/642,472, assigned to the same assignee as the present application, disclose analogs of hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 said to have enhanced antagonistic properties and prolonged duration of action. These properties are believed to result from replacement of various amino acids and acylation with aromatic or nonpolar acids at the N-terminus of GH-RH(1-29)NH2. It is noted that in the above US Patent and US Patent Application, R9 is always Ser, R16 is Gin or an amino acid forming a lactam bridge (i.e. Glu), R28 is Ser, Asn, Asp, Ala or Abu, and R29 is Agm, Arg-NH2, Arg-OH, Cit-NH2, Cit-OH, Har-NH2, Har-OH, or an amino acid forming a lactam bridge (i.e. Lys or Orn).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is provided a novel series of synthetic analogs of hGH-RH(1-29)NH2. These analogs inhibit the activity of endogenous hGH-RH, and therefore prevent the release of growth hormone. The stronger inhibitory potencies of the new analogs, as compared to previously described ones, results from replacement of various amino acids.<br>
Specifically, the invention relates to peptides comprising the formulae: X-R1lR2-Asp-Ala-R'6--R6-Thr-R8-R9-R10-Arg-R12-R13_R14R15-R'16-Leu-R1B-R19-Arg-R20-R22-Leu-Gln-Asp-lle-R27-R28-R29-NH2<br>
wherein X is PhAc. IndAc, Ibu. Nac, 1- or 2-Npr, or Fpr,<br>
R1 is Tyr or His, R2 is D-Arg or D-Cit, R5 is lie or Val,<br>
R6 is Phe, Nal or Phe(Y), in which Y = F, Cl, Br, R8 is Asn, Gin, Ser, Thr, Ala, D-Asn, D-GIn, D-Ser, D-Thr, Abu, D-Abu, or Aib,<br>
R9 is Arg, Har, Lys, Orn, D-Arg, D-Har, D-Lys, D-Orn, Cit, Nle, Tyr (Me). Ser, Ala or Aib,<br>
R10 is Tyr or Phe(Y), in which Y = H, F, Cl, Br, or OCH3,<br>
R12 is Lys, D-Lys, or Orn,<br>
R13 is Val or Nle,<br>
R14 is Leu or Nle,<br>
R15 is Gly, Ala, Abu, Nle or Gln,<br>
R16 is Gin or Arg,<br>
R18 is Ser or Nle,<br>
R19 is Ala or Abu,<br>
R21 is Lys or Orn,<br>
R22 is Leu, Ala or Aib,<br>
R27 is Met, Leu, Nle, Abu, or D-Arg,<br>
H28 is Arg, D-Arg, Ser, Asn, Asp, Ala or Abu,<br>
R-29 is Arg, D-Arg, Har or D-Har, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Among the preferred embodiment are peptides wherein X is PhAc, IndAc or Nac, R1 is Tyr or His, R2 is D-Arg, R5 is He, R6 is Phe(pCl), R8 is Asn or Abu. R9 is Arg or Har, Lys, Orn, D-Arg, D-Har, D-Lys, D-Orn, Cit, Nle, or Tyr (Me), R10 is Tyr or Tyr(Me), R12 is Lys, R13 is Val or Nle, R14 is Leu or Nle, R15 is Abu, Ala, or Nle, R16 is Gin or Arg, R18 is Ser or Nle, R19 is Ala or Abu. R21 is Lys, R27 is Nle or D-Arg,, R28 is D-Arg, Arg, or Ser, R29 is D-Arg, Har or D-Har.<br>
It is noted that the amino acid residues from 30 Through 44 of the native GH-RH molecule do not appear to be essential to activity; nor does their identity appear to be critical. Therefore, it appears that the addition of some 01 all of these further amino acid residues to the C-terminus of the hGH-RH(1-29)-NIH, analogues of the present invention will not affect the efficacy of these analogues as GH-RH antagonists. If some or all of these amino acids were added to the C-terminus of the hGH-RH(1-29)-NH2 analogues, the added amino acid residues could be the same as residues 30 through 44 in the native hGH-RH sequence or reasonable equivalents.<br>
Synthetic Methods.<br>
The synthetic peptides are synthesized by a suitable method such as by exclusive solid phase techniques, by partial solid-phase techniques, by fragment condensation or by classical solution phase synthesis.<br>
When the analogues of this invention are synthesized by solid-phase method, the C-terminus residue (here, R29) is appropriately linked (anchored) to an inert solid support (resin) while bearing protecting groups for its alpha amino group (and, where appropriate, for its side chain functional group). After completion of this step, the alpha amino protecting group is removed from the anchored amino acid residue and the next amino acid residue, R28, is added having its alpha amino group (as well as any appropriate side chain functional group) suitably protected, and so forth. The N-terminus protecting groups are removed after each residue is added, but the side chain protecting groups are not yet removed. After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence, the peptide is cleaved from the support and freed from all side chain protecting group(s) under conditions that are minimally destructive towards residues in the sequence. This is be followed by a careful purification and scrupulous characterization of the synthetic product, so as to ensure that the desired structure is indeed the one obtained.<br>
It is particularly preferred to protect the alpha amino function, of tjhe amino acids during the coupling step with an acid or base sensitive protecting group. Such protecting groups should have the properties of being stable in the conditions of peptide linkage formation, while being readily removable without destruction of the growing peptide chain and without racemization of any of the chiral centers contained therein. Suitable alpha amino protecting groups are Boc and Fmoc.<br>
Medical Applications.<br>
The hGH-RH antagonist peptides, or salts of these peptides, may be ormulated in pharmaceutical dosage forms containing effective amounts hereof and administered to humans or animal for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. The peptides may be used to suppress GH levels and to treat conditions associated with excessive levels of GH, e.g., diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, and acromegaly. Also provided are methods for treating these diseases by administration of a composition of the invention to an individual needing such treatment. The main uses of GH-RH antagonists are lowever,in the field of cancer, for example human cancers of the breast, colon, brain, pancreas, and prostate where the receptors for IGF-I or GF-It are present.<br>

C. Method of Preparation<br>
1. Overview of Synthesis<br>
The peptides are synthesized by suitable methods such as by exclusive solid phase techniques, by partial solid-phase techniques, by<br>
fragment condensation or by classical solution phase synthesis. For example, the techniques of exclusive solid-phase synthesis are set forth in the textbook "Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis", J.M. Stewart and J.D. Young, Pierce Chem. Company, Rockford, 111, 1984 (2nd. ed.), and M. Bodanszky, "Principles of Peptide Synthesis", Springer Verlag, 1984. The hGH-RH antagonist peptides are preferably prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as that generally described by Merrifield, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 85 p. 2149 (1963), although other equivalent chemical syntheses known in the art can also be used as previously mentioned.<br>
The synthesis is carried out with amino acids that are protected at their alpha amino group. Urethane type protecting groups (Boc or Fmoc) are preferably used for the protection of the alpha amino group. The preferred protecting group is Boc.<br>
In solid phase synthesis, the N-alpha-protected amino acid moiety which forms the aminoacyl group of the final peptide at the C-terminus is attached to a polymeric resin support via a chemical link. After completion of the coupling reaction, the alpha amino protecting group is selectively removed to allow subsequent coupling reactions to take place at the amino-terminus, preferably with 50% TFA in DCM when the N-alpha-protecting group is Boc. The remaining amino acids with similarly Boc-protected alpha amino groups are coupled stepwise to the free amino group of the preceding amino acid on the resin to obtain the desired peptide sequence. Because the amino acid residues are coupled to the alpha amino group of the C-terminus residue, growth of the synthetic hGH-RH analogue peptides begins at the C terminus and progresses toward the N-terminus. When the desired sequence has been obtained, the peptide is acylated at the N-terminus, and it is removed from the support polymer.<br>
Each protected amino acid is used in excess (2.5 or 3 equivalents). and the coupling reactions are usually carried out in DCM, DMF or mixtures thereof. The extent of completion of the coupling reaction is monitored at each stage by the mnhydrin reaction. In cases where incomplete coupling is determined, the coupling procedure is repeated, or a capping by acetylation of unreacted amino groups is carried out, before removal of the alpha amino protecting group prior to the coupling of the next amino acid.<br>
A typical synthesis cycle is shown in Table 1.<br>

After completion of the synthesis, the cleavage of the peptide from the resin can be effected using procedures well known in peptide chemistry.<br>
Some of the amino acid residues of the peptides have side chain functional groups which are reactive with reagents used in coupling or<br>
deprotection. When such side chain groups are present, suitable protecting groups are joined to these functional groups to prevent undesirable chemical reactions occurring during the reactions used to form the peptides. The following general rules are followed in selecting a particular side chain protecting group: (a) the protecting group preferably retains its protecting properties and is not split off under coupling conditions, (b) the protecting group should be stable under conditions for removing the alpha amino protecting group at each step of the synthesis, (c) the side chain protecting group must be removable upon the completion of the synthesis of the desired amino acid sequence, under reaction conditions that will not undesirably alter the peptide chain.<br>
The reactive side chain functional groups are preferably protected as follows: benzyl for Thr and Ser; 2-bromo-benzyloxycarbonyl for Tyr; p-toluene-sulfonyl or nitro for Arg and Har; 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl or fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl for Lys, Orn; benzyloxymethyl for His; and cyclohexyl or fluorenylmethyl for Asp and Glu. The side chains of Asn and Gln are unprotected.<br>
3. Stenwise Coupling of Amino Acid Residues to the Support Polymer<br>
The hGH-RH antagonist peptides may be synthesized on a variety of support polymers, i.e. MBHA, Merrifield, PAM or Wang resins. When N-alpha-Boc protected amino acids are used for synthesis, the preferred resin is MBHA. In this ca.se, peptides with an amidated C-terminus are obtained upon cleavage from the support phase.<br>
First, the C-terminal amino acid is attached to the neutralized MBHA resin, and then the subsequent amino acid couplings are carried out. Each protected amino acid is coupled in about a threefold molar excess, with respect to resin-bound free amino residues, and the coupling may be carried<br>
out in a medium such as DMF: CH2CI2 (1:11 or in DMF or CH2CI2 alone. The selection of an appropriate coupling reagent is within the skill of the art. Particularly suitable as coupling reagents are N,N'-diisopropyl carbodiimide (DIC), or HBTU combined with HOBt. The success of the coupling reaction at each stage of the synthesis is preferably monitored by the ninhydrin reaction. In cases where incomplete coupling occurs, either the coupling procedure is repeated, or the resin-bound unreacted amino residues are acetylated using Ac2O/DCM, before removal of the alpha amino protecting group.<br>
Final acylation of the N-terminus of the peptide is done in the same way as the previous couplings, with the difference that the appropriate carboxylic acid is used instead of an amino acid.<br>
4. Removal of the Peptide from the Support Polymer.<br>
When the synthesis is complete, the peptide is cleaved from the support phase. Removal of the peptide from the resin is performed by treatment with a reagent such as liquid hydrogen fluoride which also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups.<br>
Suitably, the dried and protected peptide-resin is treated with a mixture consisting of 1.0 mL m-cresol and 10 mL anhydrous hydrogen fluoride per gram of peptide-resin for 60 min at 0°C to cleave the peptide from the resin as well as to remove all side chain protecting groups. After the removal of the hydrogen fluoride under a stream of nitrogen and vacuum, the free peptides are precipitated with ether, filtered, washed with ether and ethyl acetate, extracted with 50% acetic acid, and lyophilized.<br>
5. Purification<br>
The purification of the crude peptides can be effected using procedures well known m peptide chemistry. For example, purification may<br>
be performed on a MacRabbit HPLC system (Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., Woburn, MA) with a Knauer UV Photometer and a Kipp and Zonen BD40 Recorder using a Vydac 218TP5010 reversed-phase column (10 x 250 mm, packed with C18 silica gel, 300 Å pore size, 5 µm particle size) (The<br>
 Separations Group Inc., Hesperia, CA). The column is eluted with a solvent system consisting of (A) 0.1% aqueous TFA and (B) 0.1% TFA in 70% aqueous MeCN in a linear gradient mode (e.g., 30-55% B in 120 min). The eluent is monitored at 220 nm, and fractions are examined by analytical HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard Model HP-1090 liquid chromatograph and<br>
 pooled to give maximum purity. Analytical HPLC is carried out on a Vydac 218TP52 reversed-phase column (2 x 250 mm, C18, 300 Å, 5 µm) using isocratic elution with a solvent system consisting of (A) and (B) defined above. The peaks are monitored at 220 and 280 nm. The peptides are judged to be substantially (&gt;95%) pure by analytical HPLC. The expected amino acid composition is also confirmed by amino acid analysis.<br>

Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, fumarate, gluconate, tannate, maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, alginate, pamoate, malate, ascorbate, tartarate, and the like. Particularly preferred antagonists are salts of low solubility, e.g., pamoate salts and the like. These exhibit long duration of activity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are suitably administered to subject humans or animals s.c, i.m., or i.v; intranasally or by pulmonary inhalation; or in a depot form (e.g., microcapsules, microgranules, or cylindrical rod like implants) formulated from a biodegradable suitable polymer (such as D,L-lactide-coglycolide), the former two depot modes being preferred. Other equivalent modes of administration are also within<br>
the scope of this invention, i.e., continuous drip, depot injections, infusion pump and time release modes such as microcapsules and the like. Administration is in any physiologically acceptable injectable carrier, physiological saline being acceptable, though other carriers known to the art may also be used.<br>
The peptides are preferably administered parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intravenously with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as isotonic saline. Alternatively, the peptides may be administered as an intranasal spray with an appropriate carrier or by pulmonary inhalation. One suitable route of administration is a depot form formulated from a biodegradable suitable polymer, e.g., poly-D,L-lactide-coglycolide as microcapsules, microgranules or cylindrical implants containing dispersed antagonistic compounds.<br>
The amount of peptide needed depends on the mode of administration and the intended result. In general, the dosage range is between 1-100 µg/g/kg of body weight of the host per day.<br>
E. Therapeutic Uses of GH-RH Antagonists<br>
hGH-RH antagonists can be used in treatment of conditions caused by excess growth hormone, for example acromegaly, which is manifested by an abnormal enlargement of the bones of the face and extremities. The ° GH-RH antagonists may also be used to treat diabetic nephropathy (the main cause of blindness in diabetics) and diabetic retinopathy, in which damage to the eye and kidney respectively is thought to be due to GH.<br>
The hGH-RH antagonists are designed to block the binding and therefore the action of GH-RH, which stimulates the secretion of GH, which in turn stimulates production of IGF-I. GH-RH antagonists may be adnjiinistered alone or together with somatostatin analogues, a combination<br>
which more completely suppresses IGF-I levels. It is advantageous to administer antagonists of GH-RH rather than somatostatin due to the fact that GH-RH antagonists may be utilized in situations where target sites do not have somatostatin receptors.<br>
However, the main applications of GH-RH antagonists are in the field of cancer. This is based on the following considerations: GH-RH antagonists are designed to block the binding and therefore the action of GH-RH, which stimulates the secretion of GH, which in turn stimulates production of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) also called somatomedin-C. The involvement of IGF-I (somatomedin-C) in breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, bone tumors and other malignancies is well established, and somatostatin analogues alone do not adequately suppress GH and IGF-I levels. A complete suppression of IGF-I levels or secretion is required for a better inhibition of tumor growth. Autocrine production of IGF-I by various tumors could be also under control of GH-RH and might therefore be inhibited by GH-RH antagonists. GH-RH antagonists might also inhibit the production of IGF-I. A more detailed theoretical background of the applications of GH-RH in the field of oncology (cancer) is as follows: The receptors for IGF-I are present in primary human breast cancers, prostate cancers, lung cancers, colon cancers, brain tumors, pancreatic cancers, and in renal cell carcinomas.<br>
The presence of IGF-I reccptors in these tumors appears to be related to malignant transformation and proliferations of these cancers. IGF-I can act as endocrine, paracrine or autocrine growth factor for various human cancers, that is the growth of these neoplasms is dependent on IGF-I. GH-RH antagonists by suppressing GH secretion would lower the production of IGF-I. Since IGF-I stimulates growth of these various neoplasms (cancers), [he lowering of circulating IGF-I levels should lead to tumor growth nhibition. It is possible that GH-RH antagonists could also lower paracrine<br>
or autocrine production of IGF-I by the tumors, which should.also lead to. inhibition of cancer proliferation. These views are in accordance with modern concepts of clinical oncology. GH-RH antagonists should be given alone or together with somatostatin analogues and a combination would achieve a more complete suppression of IGF-I levels, elimination of tissue IGF-I levels, e.g., in human osteosarcomas, as well as breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (non-SCLC).<br>
The advantage of GH-RH antagonists over somatostatin analogues is based on the fact that GH-RH antagonists may be utilized for suppression of tumors which do not have somatostatin receptors, for example human osteogenic sarcomas.<br>
Antagonistic analogs of GH-RH have been shown to suppress growth of various tumors in vivo. This effect is exerted in part through inhibition of the GHRH-GH-IGF-I axis. Nevertheless, autocrine/paracrine control of proliferation by IGF-II is also a major factor in many tumors. Interference with this autocrine growth-stimulating pathway offers an approach to tumor control. Antagonistic analogs of GH-RH, MZ-4-71 {(lbu0, Tyr1, D-Arg2, Abu15, Nle27} hGH-RHn-28) Agm} and MZ-5-156 {[PhAc0. D-Arg2, Abu16. Nle27lhGH-RH(1-28) Agm} significantly inhibited the rate of proliferation of mammary {MDA-MB-468, ZR-75-1), prostatic (PC-3 and DU-145), and pancreatic (MiaPaCa-2. SW-1990 and Capan-2) cancer cell lines in vitro as shown by colorimetric and [3H]-thymidine incorporation tests, reduced the expression of IGF-II mRNA in the cells and the concentration of IGF-II secreted into the culture medium. The same GH-RH antagonists produced similar results in vivo (inhibition of proliferation and reduction of IGF-II production) for prostate tumors (PC-3, DU-145), renal adenocarcinoma (Caki-I) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (H157). These findings suggest that antagonistic analogs of GH-RH can inhibit tumor growth not only by inhibiting the GHRH-GH-IGF-I axis, but also by reducing the IGF-II production<br>
in certain tumor cells, thus interrupting its autocrine regulatory pathway.<br>
The present invention is described in connection with the following examples which are set forth for the purposes of illustration only. In the examples, optically active protected amino acids in the L-configuration are used except where specifically noted.<br>
The following Examples set forth suitable methods of synthesizing the novel GH-RH antagonists by the solid-phase technique.<br>

The synthesis is conducted in a stepwise manner using manual solid phase peptide synthesis equipment. Briefly, para-methylbenzhydryiamine (MBHA) resin (Bachem, California) (720 mg, 0.50 mmole) is neutralized with 5% DIEA in CH2CI2 and washed according to the protocol described in Table I. The solution of Boc-Har(N02)-OH (500 mg, 1.5 mmole) in DMF-CH2CI2 (1:1) is shaken with the neutralized resin and DIC (235 µL, 1.5 mmole) in a manual solid phase peptide synthesis apparatus for 1 hour. After the completion of the coupling reaction is proved by negative ninhydrin test, deprotection with 50% TFA in CH2CI2, and neutralization with 5% DIEA in CH2CI2, the peptide chain is built stepwise by coupling the following protected amino acids in the indicated order on the resin to obtain the desired peptide sequence: Boc-D-Arg(Tos)-OH, Boc-Nle-OH, Boc-lle-OH, Boc-Asp(OcHx)-OH, Boc-Gln-OH, Boc-Leu-OH, Boc-Leu-OH, Boc-Lys(2CIZ)-OH, Boc-Arg(Tosl-OH, Boc-Ala-OH, Boc-Ser(Bzl)-OH.

After removal of the N"-Boc protecting group from Tyr1 the peptide is acylated with phenylacetic acid (PhAc) (272 mg. 2 mmole) using DIC (313µL, 2 mmole).<br>
In order to cleave the peptide from the resin and deprotect it, the dried peptide resin (2.18 g) is stirred with 2 mL m-cresol and 20 mL hydrogen fluoride (HF) at 0°C for 1 hour. After evaporation of the HF under vacuum, the remnant is washed with dry diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The cleaved and deprotected peptide is dissolved in 50 % acetic acid and separated from the resin by filtration. After dilution with water and lyophilization, 1.51 g crude product is obtained.<br>
The crude peptide is checked by analytical HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard Model HP-1090 liquid chromatograph with a Vydac 218TP52 reversed-phase column (2 x 250 mm, packed with C18 silica gel, 300 Å pore size, 5 µm particle size) (The Separations Group Inc., Hesperia, CA) and linear gradient elution, (e.g., 40-70% B) with a solvent system consisting of (A) 0.1% aqueous TFA and (B) 0.1% TFA in 70% aqueous MeCN. 500 mg of the crude peptide is dissolved in AcOH/H2O, stirred, filtered and applied on a Beckman Ultraprep ODS column (21.2 x 150 mm, packed with C18 silica gel, 300 Å pore size, 10 µm particle size). The column is eluted with a solvent system described above in a linear gradient mode (e.g., 30-55% B in 120 min); flow rate 6 mL/min. The eluent is monitored at 220 nm, and fractions are examined by analytical HPLC. Fractions with purity higher than 95% are pooled and lyophilized to give 98 mg pure product. The analytical HPLC is carried out on a Vydac C18 /eversed-phase column described above using isocratic elution with a solvent system described above with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The peaks are monitored at 220 and 280 nm. The produc is judged to be substantially<br>
(&gt;95%) pure by analytical HPLC. Molecular mass is checked by electro-, spray mass spectrometry, and the expected amino acid composition is confirmed by amino acid analysis.<br>

EXAMPLE III Biological Activity<br>
The peptides of the present invention were tested in in vitro and in vivo assays for their ability to inhibit the hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 induced GH release.<br>
Suoerfused Rat Pituitary System.<br>
The analogs were tested in vitro in a test described earlier (S. Vigh and A.V. Schally. Peptides 5:241-347, 1984) with modification (2. Rekasi and A.V. Schally. P.N.A.S. 90:2146-2149, 1993).<br>
Briefly, the cells are premcubated with peptides for 9 minutes (3mL) at various concentrations. Immediately after the incubation. 1 nM hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 is administered for 3 minutes (1mL) 10 minute response]. To check the duration of the antagonistic effect of the analogue, 1 nM hGH-RH(1-29)NH2 is applied 30. 60, 90. and 120 minutes later for 3 minutes |30, 60. 90, 120 mm responses). Net integral values of the GH responses are evaluated. GH responses are compared to and expressed as percent of the original GH response induced by 1 nM GH-RH(1-29)NH2. The effect of the new antagonists are compared to that of [Ac-Tyr1D-Arg2)hGH-RH(1-29)NH?, the "Standard antagonist".<br>
Growth Hormone Radio-immunoassav.<br>
Rat GH levels in aliquots of undiluted and diluted superfusion samples were measured by double-antibody radioimmunoassay using materials<br>
supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, Baltimore, Maryland. Jhe results of RIA were analyzed with a computer program developed in our institute (V. Csernus and A.V. Schally, in Neuroendocrine Research Methods, Harwood Academic (Greenstein, B.D. ed., London, pp. 71-109, 1991), hereby incorporated by reference. Inter-assay variation was less than 15% and intra-assay variation was less than 10%.<br>
GH-RH Binding Assay. A sensitive radioreceptor binding assay was developed to determine the binding characteristics of the antagonists of GH-RH (G. Halmos, A.V. Schally et al.. Receptor 3. 87-97, 1993), hereby incorporated by reference. The assay is based on binding of labelled IHis1,Nle27)hGH-RH(1-32)NH2 to rat anterior pituitary membrane homogenates. lodinated derivatives of |His1,Nle27]hGH-RH(1-32)NH2 are prepared by the chloramine-T method (F.C. Greenwood et al., Biochemistry 22:114-123, 1963), hereby incorporated by reference. Pituitaries from male Sprague-Oawley rats (250-300 g) are used to prepare crude membranes. For saturation binding analyses, membrane homogenates are incubated with at least 6 concentrations of [His1,125l-Tyr10,Nle27)hGH:RH(1 -32) NH2, ranging from 0.005 to 0.35 nM in the presence or absence of excess unlabelled peptide (1 µM).<br>
The pellet is counted for radioactivity in a y-counter. The affinities of the antagonist peptjdes tested to rat pituitary GH-RH receptors are determined in competitive binding experiments. The final binding affinities ar« estimated by K, (dissociation constant of the inhibitor-receptor complex) and are determined by the Ligand PC and McPherson computer programs of Munson and Rodbard (P.J. Munson and D. Rodbard, Anal. Biochem. 107, 220-239,1980). Relative affinities compared to IAc-Tyr1,D-Arg2]hGH-RH(1 -29)NH2, the Standard antagonist, are calculated as the ratio of K, of the tested GH-RH antagonist to the K, of the Standard antagonist.<br>
In Vivo Tests.<br>
GH-RH antagonistic effect of the analogs was tested on young male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g). In each experiment, 5 groups of 7 animals each were used. The compounds (80µg/kg) and GH-RH(1-29)NH2 (3 pg/kg) were dissolved in 5.5% mannitol and given intravenously to the jugular vein of the rats under Nembutal anesthesia. The time elapsed between the administrations of the antagonist and GH-RH varied between groups, according to the following schedule. The first group of animals received GH-RH injection 5 min after the administration of the antagonist; for the second, third and fourth group of animals, the time interval elapsed between the injection of the antagonist and that of GH-RH was 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively. The control group was first injected with the solvent alone instead of the antagonist, followed by a GH-RH injection 5 min later.<br>
0.4 mL blood samples were taken for GH RIA before the administration of the antagonist ("bloodO"), and 5 min after the injection of GH-RH ("blood1"). The GH response in each group was calculated as rGH = (GHbloodGHblood), mean±S.E.M. of the individual differences. Relative inhibition of GH response (%) in each group treated was calculated as 100x(rGHtreated-1)/(rGHcontral-1)<br>
Results in vitro.<br>
The results of the in vitro antagonistic activities tested in superfused rat pituitary system and binding assay are summarized in Table II and Table III, respectively. As it can be seen from these data, the substitutions present in the molecules cause an immense increase in receptor binding as well as in inhibition of GH release in vitro as compared to the standard antagonist. The most potent antagonist in vitro, Peptide 1, caused a complete inhibition of the GH-RH induced GH release for 90 min, under the standard test conditions. The first sign of the recovery of the GH-RH responsiveness was detected 120 min after the exposure to this analog.<br>

EXAMPLE IV Oncological tests.<br>
Antitumor activities of the peptides of the present invention were tested in various cancer models. The antitumor effects of these new peptides were compared with those of earlier analogs (MZ-4-71 and MZ-5-156, subject to US Patent 5,550,212 and US Patent application 08/642,472.<br>
Effect of GH-RH antagonists on MXT mouse mammary tumors<br>
Estrogen independent MXT tumors were transplanted sc. to female BDF mice. One day after transplantation, the mice were divided into groups of 10 animals each, and the treatment was started. The mice in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 received single injections daily of various GH-RH antagonists sc. at 20 µg dose per day for 18 days. In groups 5 and 6, the peptides were administered by Alzet osmotic pumps releasing a daily amount of 20 µg peptide. Tumors were measured regularly, and tumor volume was calculated. The mice were sacrificed on day 18 and tumor weights were measured.<br>
Results<br>
Peptides Peptide 1 and Peptide 3 had similar strong inhibitory effect on MXT mouse mammary cancers. Treatment with MZ-5-156 also resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth, but its effect was weaker than that of Peptide 1 or Peptide 3 (see Table V and Figure I).<br>

Effect of GH-RH antagonists on MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer xenoqrafts in nude mice<br>
Nude mice bearing MDA-MB-468 hormone-independent human breast cancer xenografts were divided into groups of 10 animals each. The treated groups received single daily s.c. injections of 20 µg of GH-RH antagonists. One group was treated with Peptide 1, a second group was treated with MZ-5-156 for comparison. The control group was injected with the vehicle solvent. The treatment was continued for 5 weeks. Tumors were measured once a week and tumor volume was calculated. The mice were sacrificed at the end of experiment and tumor weights were measured.<br>
Results<br>
Both peptides exerted significant tumor-inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-468 xenografts. In the group injected with Peptide 1, 4 tumors showed constant regression during the experiment. Likewise, MZ-5-156 caused<br>
regression of 3 tumors. After 5 weeks of treatment these cancers regressed to small scar-like tissue remnants. Histological examination of these tissues revealed undifferentiated epithelial tumors with extensive necrosis and only a narrow marginal line of living tumor tissue. In contrast, all tumors in the control animals progressed steadily. Final tumor volume and weight in the treated groups were significantly reduced (see Table VI and Figure II), Peptide 1 having a stronger effect.<br>

Effect of GH-RH antagonists on PC-3 human prostate cancer xenoarafts in nude mice<br>
Male nude mice were implanted s.c. with 3 mm3 pieces of PC-3 human hormone-independent prostate cancer tissue into both flanks. When tumors reached a volume of approx. 40-50 mm3 the mice were divided into 3 experimental groups. The first and second groups were treated with peptides Peptide 3 and MZ-5-156, respectively, in single daily s.c. injections of 20 µg for 21 days, while the third group served as control. Tumor volumes were measured at weekly intervals, tumor weights were measured at the end of experiment.<br>
Both GH-RH antagonists inhibited growth of PC-3 tumors (see Table IX and Figure V). Peptide 3 exerted stronger growth inhibition (65% inhibition in tumor volume and 62% in tumor weight) than MZ-5-156 (52% and 46%, respectively).<br>
