				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process of fusing silver sheets with different metal sheets for producing silver articles with decorative patterns.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In a traditional techniques, nine metal sheets were used in making a single sheet in the following order:<br>
silver<br>
copper<br>
silver<br>
guilding metal alloy<br>
silver<br>
bronze<br>
silver<br>
brass<br>
silver<br>
All  these metals were fused together with a very fast moving solder resulting in lot of waste because of the air bubbles between the two plates.<br>
The objects of the present invention is to avoid the waste and improve the process by reducing the number of metal sheets in the fusing process. The second object of the invention is to fuse two different metal plates together and thereafter fuse the remaining metal plates one by one till the last plate to avoid the formation of air bubbles between the plates.<br>
To achieve said objectives, this invention provides a process of fusing silver sheets with different metal sheets for producing decorative patterns on silver articles comprising:<br>
selecting the metal sheets of size 10x2.5 cm to 20x5 cm for their<br>
compatibility in terms  of malleability and ability to be  silver<br>
soldered,<br>
flattening and filing the surface of said sheets to make the said sheets<br>
free of oxides, pits, and deep scratches,<br>
applying borax p owder a s a s oldering flux o n t he su rfaces o f s aid<br>
sheets keeping two sheets at an angle 40-45° at a time and soldering,<br>
heating said sheets with a torch till the two sheets are in orange<br>
colour and join,<br>
placing the other sheets of metal one by one  on said joined sheets<br>
and soldering and heating till the last sheet to form a block of metal<br>
sheets,<br>
hammering said block of metals to increase mainly in the width to<br>
remove air bubbles,<br>
rolling said block of metal sheets with a rolling mill upto thickness<br>
ranging from 0.6 mm to 3 mm stage by stage,<br>
cutting said metal sheet block in two blocks,<br>
soldering a thick sheet of silver plate 10-12 mm. on each block of<br>
said metal sheets and hammering to remove the air bubbles and<br>
increase the size 1 to 2 mm.,<br>
rolling down said block of metal sheets with silver p late t o 2 mm<br>
gradually,<br>
decorating said sheets by either hammering, filing and rolling or by<br>
chiseling and rolling or by punching and rolling,<br><br>
cleaning the surfaces of said decorative sheets with dilute sulphuric acid and thereafter finishing with sand paper, peumic stone or powder and normal hair brush and ammonium bath and waxing and finally preparing the desired decorative article from said sheets,<br>
The said two blocks are placed one above the other to make a thicker billet to create the shape and thickness required for a bigger article.<br>
The metal sheets selected are silver and copper sheets.<br>
The metal sheets selected are silver and gold sheets<br>
The metal sheets selected are silver and guilding metal alloy sheets.<br>
The metal sheets selected are silver and bronze sheets.<br>
The metal sheets selected are silver and brass sheets.<br>
The metal sheets selected are taken into following order: silver copper silver<br>
guilding metal alloy (Cu, Brass , Zn) silver copper silver<br>
The metal sheets selected are taken into following order: silver<br>
bronze<br>
silver<br>
guilding metal alloy (Cu, Brass , Zn)<br>
silver<br>
copper<br>
silver<br>
The metal sheets selected are taken into following order: silver brass silver<br>
guilding metal alloy (Cu, Brass , Zn) silver copper silver<br>
The metal sheets selected are taken into following order: silver gold silver<br>
guilding metal alloy (Cu, Brass , Zn) silver copper silver<br>
During the course of decorative step, the guild metal alloy produces black colour, solder produces greenish blue colour, copper produces dark brown color, bronze produces orange colour and brass produces golden colour.<br>
The different gauge of sand papers are used depending upon the fineness of the surface required.<br>
The gauge of sand papers used are 130 and 160.<br>
The invention also provides the decorated article prepared by the above process.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following example:<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
Preparation of raw material:<br>
Plates of silver, copper, guilding metal alloy are prepared in the size 10 x 2.5 cm flat sheets. The said sheets are cleaned and borax powder (soldering flux) is applied to each said sheet. Binding two sheets, silver and copper together at a time soldering. The said two sheets are kept at an angle of 45° and soldered with a feed wire solder consisting of fine silver and copper. The said soldered sheets are heated by a torch till the sheets are in orange colour and joined together. Thereafter, again the silver sheet is placed soldered and heated. In the like manner, the guilding metal alloy sheet, silver alloy sheet and lastly a silver sheet are soldered in the same manner to form the block of metal sheets. Hammering said block of metals to increase in width to 3.5 cm and removing air bubbles.<br>
Rolling the said thick block of metal sheets upto 2 mm. thickness. Soldering the final sheet of silver which is 12 mm thick on the 2 mm thick sheet.<br>
Hammering said joined sheets to remove the air bubbles and rolling upto 2 mm. Decorating said rolled sheet by either hammering filing and rolling or chiseling and rolling and punching and rolling. The guild metal will give black colour, solder u sed i n j oining w ill g ive g reenish b lue c olour a nd c opper w ill give dark<br>
brown color to form a pattern on the surface. The sheets are finished with difference gauge of sand papers or peumic powder or stone and thereafter a desired article is made from said sheet. Finally finished article is waxed.<br>
Example - 2:<br>
Ingredients and process in this example are same as in example 1 except copper is replaced by bronze.<br>
Example-3:<br>
Ingredients and process in this example are same as in example 1 except copper is replaced by brass.<br>
