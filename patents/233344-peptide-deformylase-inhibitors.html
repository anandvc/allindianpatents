				<td>The present invention relates to N-hydroxyformamide compound of Formula (I).<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the use of novel anti-bacterial N-formyl-N-hydroxylamine compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds as peptide deformylase inhibitors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bacterial initiator methionyl tRNA is modified by methionyl tRNA formyltransferase (FMT) to produce formyl-methionyl tRNA. The formyl methionine (f-Met) is then incorporated at the N-termini of newly synthesized polypeptides. Polypeptide deformylase (PDF or Def) then deformylates primary translation products to produce N-methionyl polypeptides. Most intracellular proteins are further processed by methionine amino peptidase (MAP) to yield the mature peptide and free methionine, which is recycled. PDF and MAP are both essential for bacterial growth, and PDF is required for MAP activity. This series of reactions is referred to as the methionine cycle (Figure 1)<br>
To date, polypeptide deformylase homologous genes have been found in bacteria, in chloroplast-containing plants, in mice and in humans. The plant proteins are nuclear encoded but appear to carry a chloroplast localization signal. This is consistent with the observation that chloroplast RNA and protein synthesis processes are highly similar to those of eubacteria. While there is limited information on protein expression of mammalian PDF gene homologs (Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Pat. WO2001/42431), no functional role for such proteins has been demonstrated to date (Meinnel T. 2000, Parasitology Today, 16(4), 165-168).<br>
Polypeptide deformylase is found in all eubacteria for which high coverage genomic sequence information is available. Sequence diversity among PDF homologs is high, with as little as 20% identity between distantly related sequences. However, conservation around the active site is very high, with several completely conserved residues, including one cysteine and two histidines which are required to coordinate the active site metal (Meinnel, T. et al, 1997, Journal of Molecular Biology, 267, 749-761).<br>
PDF is recognized to be an attractive anti-bacterial target, as this enzyme has been demonstrated to be essential for bacterial growth in vitro (Mazel, D. et al, EMBO J. 13 (4), 914-923,1994), is not believed to be involved in eukaryotic protein synthesis (Rajagopalan et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119,12418-12419,1997), and is universally conserved in prokaryotes (Kozak, M. Microbiol. Rev. 47, 1-45,1983). Therefore PDF inhibitors can potentially serve as broad spectrum anti-bacterial agents.<br>

Also included in the present invention are pharmaceutically acceptable salts and complexes, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, trifluoroacetate, sodium, potassium, and magnesium salts. The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may exist in racemic and optically active forms. All of these compounds and diastereomers are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared according to the following representative schemes, which are illustrative of the methods employed and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by a process analogous to Scheme 1.<br><br>
The oxazolidine derivative 1-Scheme-1 can be prepared from L-serine methyl ester as described in the literature [D. Seebach, J. D. Aebi, M. Gander-Coquoz and R. Naef, Helv. Chim. Acta., 70, 1194 (1987)]. Treatment of 1-Scheme-1 with a suitable base such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in the presence of a reactive<br>
halide R1X in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran/hexamethylphosphoramide (10:1) affords ester 2-Scheme-l. which can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to give a-substituted serine 3-Scheme-l. The N-substituted hydantoin derivative 5-Scheme-I can be prepared by direct treatment of 3-Scheme-l with an isocyanate R2NCO, or alternatively, treatment of 3-Scheme-l with potassium cyanate provides hydantoin 4-Scheme-l which can then be alkylated with a halide R2X. Alcohol 5-Scheme-l can be oxidized with a suitable reagent such as Dess-Martin periodinane to give the aldehyde which can be treated with O-benzyl hydroxylamine to provide oxime (&gt; Scheme-1. Reduction of oxime 6-Scheme-l with sodium cyanoborohydride followed by treatment with the mixed anhydride formed from formic acid and acetic anhydride provides formamide 7-Scheme-l. Finally, N-formyl-N-hydroxylamine 8; Scheme-1 is obtained by hydrogenolysis of 7-Scheme-l in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on activated carbon.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared from alcohol 5; Scheme-1 as shown in Scheme 2. Mitsunobu reaction of 5-Scheme-2 affords compound 9-Scheme-2. Removal of the protecting groups under acidic conditions provides hydroxylamine derivative 10-Scheme-2. Treatment of 10-Scheme-2 with the mixed anhydride formed from formic acid and acetic anhydride results in N,O-formylated compound ll-Scheme-2. and removal of the O-formyl group by basic hydrolysis gives N-formyl-N-hydroxylamine 12-Scheme-2.<br>
The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following Examples which illustrate the methods by which the compounds of the invention may be prepared and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>

With appropriate manipulation and protection of any chemical functionality, synthesis of the remaining compounds of Formula (I) is accomplished by methods analogous to those described.<br>
The present compounds are useful for the treatment of bacterial infections. In order to use a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be administered in a standard manner for antibiotics, for example orally, parenterally, sub-lingually, dermally, transdermally, rectally, via inhalation or via buccal administration.<br>
Compositions of Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are active when given orally can be formulated as syrups, tablets, capsules, creams and lozenges. A syrup formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or salt in a liquid carrier for example, ethanol, peanut oil, olive oil, glycerine or water with a flavoring or coloring agent. Where the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier routinely used for preparing solid formulations may be used. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, terra alba, talc, gelatin, acacia, stearic acid, starch, lactose and sucrose. Where the composition is in the form of a capsule, any routine encapsulation is suitable, for example using the aforementioned carriers in a hard gelatin capsule shell. Where the composition is in the form of a soft gelatin shell capsule any pharmaceutical carrier routinely used for preparing dispersions or<br>
suspensions may be considered, for example aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils, and are incorporated in a soft gelatin capsule shell.<br>
Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of a compound or salt in a sterile aqueous or non-aqueous carrier optionally containing a parenterally acceptable oil, for example polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil.<br>
Typical compositions for inhalation are in the form of a solution, suspension or emulsion that may be administered as a dry powder or in the form of an aerosol using a conventional propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane or trichlorofluoromethane.<br>
A typical suppository formulation comprises a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which is active when administered in this way, with a binding and/or lubricating agent, for example polymeric glycols, gelatins, cocoa-butter or other low melting vegetable waxes or fats or their synthetic analogs.<br>
Typical dermal and transdermal formulations comprise a conventional aqueous or non-aqueous vehicle, for example a cream, ointment, lotion or paste or are in the form of a medicated plaster, patch or membrane.<br>
Preferably the composition is in unit dosage form, for example a tablet, capsule or metered aerosol dose, so that the patient may administer a single dose.<br>
Each dosage unit for oral administration contains suitably from 0.1 mg to 500 mg/Kg, and preferably from 1 mg to 100 mg/Kg, and each dosage unit for parenteral administration contains suitably from 0.1 mg to 100 mg/Kg of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free acid. Each dosage unit for intranasal administration contains suitably 1-400 mg and preferably 10 to 200 mg per person. A topical formulation contains suitably 0.01 to 5.0% of a compound of Formula (I).<br>
The daily dosage regimen for oral administration is suitably about 0.01 mg/Kg to 40 mg/Kg of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free acid. The daily dosage regimen for parenteral<br>
administration is suitably about 0.001 mg/Kg to 40 mg/Kg of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free acid. The daily dosage regimen for intranasal administration and oral inhalation is suitably about 10 to about 500 mg/person. The active ingredient may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day, sufficient to exhibit the desired activity.<br>
No unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present invention are administered in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The biological activity of the compounds of Formula (I) are demonstrated by the following test:<br>
Biological Assay:<br>
S. aureus or E. coli PDF activity is measured at 25°C, using a continuous enzyme-linked assay developed by Lazennec &amp; Meinnel, (1997) "Formate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrophotometric assay of peptide deformylase" Anal. Biochem. 244, pp.180-182, with minor modifications. The reaction mixture is contained in 50 uL with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH7.6), 15 mM NAD, 0.25 U formate dehydrogenase. The substrate peptide, f-Met-Ala-Ser, is included at the KM concentration. The reaction is triggered with the addition of 10 nM Defl enzyme, and absorbance is monitored for 20 min at 340 nm.<br>
Antimicrobial Activity Assay<br>
Whole-cell antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended procedure, Document M7-A4, "Methods for Dilution Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically" (incorporated by reference herein). The compound was tested in serial two-fold dilutions ranging from 0.06 to 64 meg/ml. A panel of 12 strains were evaluated in the assay.
