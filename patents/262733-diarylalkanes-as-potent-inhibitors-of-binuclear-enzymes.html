DIARYLALKANES AS POTENT INHIBITORS OF BINUCLEAR<br>
'ENZYMES<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/575,599, filed May 28, 2004, entitled "Diarylalkanes as Potent Inhibitors of Binuclear Enzymes," which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	This invention relates generally to the prevention and treatment of diseases<br>
and conditions mediated by binuclear enzymes. Specifically, the present invention includes a method for inhibiting the activity of an enzyme having a binuclear active site. Included in the present invention are novel compositions comprised of one or more diarylalkane(s). The diarylalkanes of the present invention can be isolated from one or more plant sources or can be obtained by organic synthesis. Further included in the present invention are methods for isolating these compounds from a natural source and methods for synthesizing these compounds. In one embodiment, the diarylalkanes are obtained by synthetic modification of a naturally occurring compound isolated from a plant source.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	There is a great demand for products able to inhibit or prevent excessive<br>
pigmentation of the skin. Melanin, the skin's natural pigment, is a nitrogenous polymer<br>
synthesized in melanosomes, which are membrane-bound organelle present within<br>
melanocytes. Melanin is produced in varying concentrations, depending on skin type (genetic<br>
disposition) and environmental conditions. Melanocytes are cells that occur in the basal<br>
membrane of the epidermis, and account for between 5% and 10% of the cellular content<br>
(approximately 1200-1500 melanocytes per cm2). When stimulated, by factors such as<br>
ultraviolet (UV) light melanocytes divide more rapidly, thereby producing greater quantities<br>
of melanin. The melanin is then transported in mature melanosomes to keratinocytes, within<br>
the epidermis where it becomes visible as a brown skin color.<br>
[0004]	The number of melanocytes in human skin is more or less the same,<br>
irrespective of skin color. The color o f the skin is largely dependent on the quantity and type of melanin produced (black eumelanin or yellow to reddish-brown pheomelanin). Asians and light-skinned people have lower levels of eumelanin than dark-skinned people, and<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
correspondingly less protection against the effects of radiation. People with red hair are characterized by pigmentation with pheomelanin, and have little or no photo-protection. Additionally, the distribution of melanin in the skin also varies: In people with light skin, the greater part of the pigment lies in the basal layer, whereas" in those with dark skin, the melanin is spread throughout, reaching into the horny layer.<br>
[0005]	The overproduction of melanin can cause different types of abnormal skin<br>
color, hair color and other diseases and conditions of the skin. There are primarily two conditions related to skin pigmentation disorders. A darkening of the skin that includes abnormal elevated melanin caused by UV exposure and aging; and abnormal distribution of skin pigments resulting in age spots, liver spots, and drug and wound/disease induced hyperpimentation (Seiberg et al. (2000) J, Invest. Dermavol. 115:162; Paine et al. (2001) J. Invest. Dermatol. 116:587).<br>
[0006]	Modulators of melanogenesis (the production of melanin) may be designed or<br>
chosen to function in a variety of way;; as illustrated in Figure 1. With reference to Figure 1, they may act directly on modulating melanosome structure and function prior to melanin synthesis, they may act by inhibiting the production or function of enzymes, such as tyrosinase, which are involved in the synthesis of melanin, they may changing the ratio of eumelanin/pheomelanin, or they may function by damping mechanisms responsible for transfer of melanosomes from melanocyte to keratinocytes. (Briganti et al (2003) Pigment Cell Research 16:101-110).<br>
[0007]	Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in the production of melanin. It catalyzes three<br>
reactions: the hydroxylation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanme (DOPA), oxidation of DOPA to DOPA quinone and the oxidation of DHI (5,6-dihydroxyindoIe) to indole quinone. (Hearing et al. (1991) FASEB 53:515). It has been determined that tyrosinase needs both the substrate and divalent metal ions for its catalytic activity. The processes currently used for inhibiting the synthesis of melanin with a view to lightening skin are primarily based on substances which inhibit tyrosinase activity, either directly by interacting with tyrosinase itself, or indirectly e.g., by complexing the necessary metal ions.<br>
[0008]	Tyrosinase belongs to the family of type 3 copper proteins, which contain two<br>
copper ions at their active site. Studies of the structure of the active site of tyrosinase have revealed that the two copper ions are closely spaced and each ion is coordinated to three histidines through the N-e nitrogen atom of its side chain, as illustrated in Figure 2. (Pfiffner and Lerch (1981) Biochem. 20: 6029; Cuff et al. (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 278:855). The binuclear copper ions can exist in three main redox forms- the Cu'-Cu1 reduced form, the<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
Cu"-O2-Cu" form which reversibly binds to O2 as the peroxide, and the resting form of the<br>
enzyme, where the Cu2+ ions are normally bridged by a small ligand. It has been determined<br>
that the Cu11-O2-Cu11 redox slate is key to the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase. In this state,<br>
tyrosinase catalyzes the introduction of a second hydroxyl group to the ortho position of a<br>
mono-phenol (such as tyrosine) a reaction which is key to the biosynthesis of melanin.<br>
[0009]	Any compound, which interferes with the access, ligand formation, or the<br>
oxidation of monophenols at the active site of tyrosinase, will be an efficient inhibitor of tyrosinase, potentially resulting in a decrease in the production of melanin and lighter skin color. Generally speaking, the copper ions at the active site of tyrosinase can be easily chelated with lone pair electrons on oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and halogens. (Weder et al. (1999) Inorg. Chem. 38:1736). Figure 3 illustrates the structures and mechanisms of action of several known tyrosinase inhibitors. (Briganti et al. (2003) Pigment Cell Research 16:101-110; Seo et al (2003) J. Agric. Food Chem. 51:2837).<br>
[0010]	With reference to Figure 3, it can be seen that compounds with structures<br>
similar to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), such as hydroquinone, both inhibit tyrosinase and are also melanocytolytic agents. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,077). For example, arbutin, isolated from the leaves of the common bearberry, Uvae ursi, is a naturally occurring beta-glucopyranoside of hydroquinone, which inhibits tyrosinase and effects melanin synthesis in human melanocytes. (Chakraborty et al. (1998) Pigment Cell Res. l_L:206; U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,904). The mechanism of action for arbutin involves competition with L-tyrosine or L-dopa for binding at the active site of tyrosinase. It does not suppress the expression or the synthesis of the protein. (Maeda and Fukuda (1996) J. Pharmacol. Exp. 276:765). Synthetic arbutin type compounds also strongly inhibit human tyrosinase. (Sugimoto et al. (2003) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 51:798). Kinobeon A, a novel diquinone isolated from cultured cells of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L), has tyrosinase inhibitory activity greater than that of kojic acid. (Kanehira etal (2003) Planta Med. 6£:457). If applied over long periods of time or in high concentrations hydroquinones can have serious side effects. Additionally, hydroquinones may lead to permanent de-pigmentation, and thus to increased photosensitivity of the skin when exposed to UV light.<br>
[0011]	Better-tolerated skin lightening substances currently being used are of natural<br>
origin. For example, kojic acid is a natural hydroxyl-y-pyrone derived from carbohydrate solutions containing certain bacteria. With reference to Figure 3, it can be seen that kojic acid is an oxidized ortho-dihydroxyphenol. Kojic acid is known to form strong chelates with metal ions especially Cu". (Gerard and Hugel (1975) Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 42:2404). It is a<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
potent competitive, but slow binding inhibitor of tyrosinase. (Cabanes et al (1994) J. Pharm.<br>
Pharmacol. 46:982). Recent studies have shown that kojic acid acts as a bridging ligand,<br>
binding strongly to both the dicopper (II) complex and to the dicopper-dioxygen adduct,<br>
thereby preventing the binding of the catechol substrate to the enzyme. (Battaini et al (2000)<br>
JBIC 1:262). Kojic acid and its esters have been patented for use as skin whiteners. (see<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,369,174; 4,771060; 5,824,327; 5,427,775; 4,990,330).<br>
[0012]	Flavonoids are another class of natural products that have been reported as<br>
inhibitors of tyrosinase. (Shimizu et al (2000) Planta Med. 66:11; Xie et al. (2003) Biochem. 68:487). Active tyrosinase inhibitors include flavones (Likhitwitayawuid et al. (2000) Planta Med. £6:275), flavonols (Kubo and Kinst-Hori (1999) J. Agric. Food Chem. 47:4121), prenylnated flavonoids (Kuniyoshi et al (2002) Planta Med. 68:79; Son et al.<br>
(2003)	Planta Med. 69:559; Kim et al (2003) Biol. Pharm. Bull. 26:1348), flavans (No el al<br>
(1999) Life Sci. 65:PL241; Kim et al. (2004) Biomacromolecules 5:474), and dihydro-<br>
chalcones (Shoji etal. (1997) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 61:1963).<br>
[0013]	Other types of tyrosinase inhibitors include: phenol derivatives (Sakuma et al<br>
(1999) Arch. Pharm. Res. 22:335; Kerry and Rice-Evans (1999) J. Neurochem. 73:247; Battaini et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:44606), benzaldehydes (Kubo and Kinst-Hori (1999) Plant Medica 65:19; Chen et al. (2003) J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem. 18:491; Nihei et al.<br>
(2004)	Bioorg. Med. Chem. 14:681), benzoic acid derivatives (Curto etal (1999) Biochem<br>
Pharmacol. 57:663; Chen et al (2003) J. Protein Chem. 22:607; Miyazawa et al. (2003) J.<br>
Agric. Food Chem. 51:9653; Kubo et al (2003) Z. Naturforsch [C] 58:713), cupferron (Xie<br>
et al. (2003) Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 35:1658), benzodipyran from Glycyrrhiza uralensis<br>
root (Yokota et al. (1998) Pigment Cell Res. 11:335), thiohydroxyl compounds (Park et al.<br>
(2003) J. Protein Chem. 22:613), terpenoids (Oh et al (2002) Planta Med. 68:832), and<br>
oxazolodinethione (Seo et al. (1999) Planta Med. 65:683). The most potent known natural<br>
tyrosinase inhibitors are stilbenes (IC50=O.3-5 µM) (Shin et al. (1998) Biochem Biophys. Res.<br>
Commun. 243:801; Ohguchi et al. (2003) Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 67:1587), stilbene<br>
glycosides (Iida et al. (1995) Planta Med. 61.: 425) and 4-substituted resorcinols (Shimizu et<br>
al (2000) Planta Med. 66:11).<br>
[0014]	A structure/activity study of 4-substituted resorcinols reveals that hydrophobic<br>
and less bulky substituents, such as -CH2C6H5, and alkyl groups i.e. -CH2CH2CH3 have the greatest potency with IC5o's of less than 10 µM (Shimizu et al. (2000) Planta Med. 66:11). The mechanism of action for 4-substituted resorcinols has been characterized as slow-binding competitive inhibition of the oxidation of DL-p-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)aIanine (DL-dopa)<br>

WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
(Jimenez and Garcia-Carmona (1997) J. Agric. Food Chem. 45:2061) without any further<br>
understanding of the metal chelating effects on binuclear copper ions.<br>
[0015]	Aloe, a member of the Lily family, is an intricate plant that contains many<br>
biologically active substances. (Cohen el al. (1992) in Wound Healing/Biochemical and Clinical Aspects. 1st ed. W B Saunders, Philadelphia). Over 360 species of Aloe are known, most of which are indigenous to Africa. Historically, Aloe products have been used in dermatological applications for the treatment of burns, sores and other wounds. These uses have stimulated a great deal of research in identifying compounds from Aloe plants that have clinical activity. (See, e.g., Grindlay and Reynolds (1986) J. of Ethnopharmacology 16:117-151; Hart et al (1988) J. of Ethnopharmacology 23:61-71).<br>
[0016]	Yagi et al. disclose a group of compounds isolated from Aloe, particularly<br>
aloesin and one of its derivatives, 2"-O-feruloylaloesin, which are effective inhibitors of<br>
tyrosinase. (Yagi et al. (1987) Plant Medica 515-517; Yagi et al. (1977) Z. Naturforsch<br>
32c:731-734). Aloesin, a C-glucosylated 5-methylchromone inhibited human tyrosinase<br>
hydroxylase activity in a dose dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.92 mM and also inhibited<br>
DOPA oxidase activity in a dose dependent manner with ICso= 0.70 mM compared to kojic<br>
acid, which has an TC50 = 0.41 mM, and arbutin which has an IC5o= 3.02 mM. Inhibition of<br>
tyrosinase enzymatic activity and consequent melanin formation by aloesin was confirmed in<br>
a cell-based assay using B16 Fl murine melanoma cells. Melanin biosynthesis was inhibited<br>
by aloesin (IC50= 0.167 mM) in a dose dependent manner. (Jones et al. (2002) Pigment. Cell<br>
Res. 15:335). The mechanism of action of tyrosinase inhibition for aloe chromones is<br>
speculated as being related to the reduction of copper ions. Both natural (U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,451,357), semi-synthetic (U.S. Pat. No. 5,801256; U.S. Pat No. 6,083976) and formulated<br>
aloe chromones (U.S. Pat. No. 6,123,959) have been patented for their skin whitening ability.<br>
[0017]	Ascorbic acid (vitamin C from synthetic and natural sources such as citrus<br>
fruits) and its derivatives have also been utilized for skin whitening. In most cases, vitamin C is formulated with kojic acid or other tyrosinase inhibitors (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,919921; 6,458,379 and 5,916,915). Other reported skin whitening compounds include extracts from olive plants (U.S. Pat. No. 6,682,763), unsaturated long chain fatty acids (U.S. Pat. No.6,669,932), curcumins (U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,845), enzyme extracts (U.S. Pat No. 6,514,506), coumestrol (U.S. Pat. No. 6,503,941), hydroxyl carboxylic acids (U.S. Pat. No. 6,417,226; 6,365,137; 5,609,875; 5,262,153), beta-glucans (US#6,251,877), aloe chromones (U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,976), phenylalanine compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,158), rutin (U.S. Pat.

[0018]	Diarylalkanes are a rare class of natural product. To date, there are more than<br>
179,000 natural compounds listed in the: Dictionary of Natural Products on CD-ROM (Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, Version 12:2 January 2004), of which only 82 are diarylpropanes (n=3). Broussonetia papyrifera is a deciduous tree in Moracea family and more than twenty diarylpropanes have been isolated from this genera alone (Keto et al. (1986) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 34:2448; lkuta et al. (1986) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 34:1968; Takasugi et al (1984) Chem. Lett. 689; Gonzalez et al. (1993) Phytochem. 32:433). Bioassay directed fractionation of an extract of Broussonetia papyrifera yielded four diarylpropanes which did not have aromatase inhibitory activity. (Lee et al. (2001) J. Nat. Prod. 64:1286). However, two prenylated diarylpropanes isolated from the same plant exhibited cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines(Ko et al. (1999) J.Nat. Prod. 62:164) andbroussonin A exhibited anti-fungal activity (Iida et al (1999) Yakugaku Zasshi. 119:964).<br>
[0019]	A number of diarylalkanes have also been isolated from the Iryanthera species<br>
(Myristicaccae). (Alvea et al (1975) Phytochem. 14:2832; de Almeida et al (1979)<br>
Phytochem. 18:1015; Braz et al. (1980) Phytochem. 19:1195: Diaz et al. (1986) Phytochem.<br>
25:2395). Four dihydrochalcones isolated from Iryanthera lancifolia showed antioxidant<br>
activity (Silva et al (1999) J. Nat. Piod. 62:1475). A number diarylpropanes have also been<br>
were isolated from the Virola species of Myristicaceae. (Braz et al (1976) Phytochem.<br>
15:567; Hagos et al. (1987) Plant Med. 53:57; Gonzalez el al. (1993) Phytochem. 32:433;<br>
Kijjoa et al (1981) Phytochem. 20:1385; Talukdar et al. (2000) Phytochem. 53:155).<br>
[0020]	Other diarylpropanes isolated from natural sources include those from<br>
Pterocarpits marsupium (Fabaceae) (Rao et al. (1984) Phytochem. 23:897; Maurya et al. (1985) J. Nat. Prod. 48:313), Under a umbellate (Lauraceae) (Morimoto el al. (1985) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 35:2281), Helichrysum mundii (Compositae) (Bohlmann et al. (1978) Phytochem. XT. 1935), Viscum angulatum (Loranthaceae) (Lin el al. (2002) J. Nat. Prod. 65:638), those from Acacia tortilis (Leguminosae), which have a smooth muscle relaxing effect (Hagos et al. (1987) Planta Med. 53:27),Xanthocercis zambesiaca (Leguminosae)<br>

[0021]	Japanese Patent No. JP05213729A teaches the use of synthetic<br>
dihydrochalcones as melanin inhibitors for Lreatment of skin inflammation, stains, freckles and chromatosis resulting from sun-burn. The claimed compounds have the following general formula:<br><br>
wherein X is selected from H, OH or =0; R is H or Me; and R1 -R3 are independently selected from H, OR and NH2. Thus, the disclosed dihydrochalcones contain a single hydroxy/methoxy substituent on one phenyl ring and five non-specific substituents (R1-R5) on the second ring. No enzyme inhibition for any of the claimed compositions was measured, rather the inhibition of melanin was determined by measurement of the amount of melanin produced by cultured skin cells and color changes of animal skin following UV stimulation. In the current invention, one of the compounds disclosed in JP05213729A, l-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3~(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-l-propanol, was synthesized and its ability to inhibit tyrosinase was measured. This compound exhibited only moderate inhibition of tyrosinase (IC50=305 µM, Table 2.) The present invention teaches novel diarylalkanes which have a unique substitution pattern wherein at least one of the two aromatic rings Ar1 or Ar2 are substituted with 1-5 R' groups (R'i-R'5) and wherein at least 2 of said of R'1R'5 are not H). These compounds exhibit an unexpected ability to inhibit the activity of tyrosinase, which is 4-600 fold greater than the compounds taught by JP05213729. It is believed that to date there are no published reports any of the compounds taught in the instant application.<br>

Leguminosae, Liliaceae, Loranthaceae, Moracea, and Myristicaceae. The diarylalkanes of this invention can be extracted, concentrated, and purified from the genera of high plants, including but not limited to Acacra, Broussonetia, Dianella, Helichrysum, Iryanthera, Knema, Lindera, Pterocarpus, Viscum, and Xanthocercis. The diarylalkanes can be found in different parts of the plant, including but not limited to stems, stem barks, heart woods, trunks, trunk barks, twigs, tubers, roots, root barks, young shoots, seeds, rhizomes, flowers and other reproductive organs, leaves and other aerial parts. In a one embodiment, the diarylalkanes are isolated from a plant or plants in the Broussonetia, Dianella, and hyanthera genera.<br>
[0070]	In another embodiment, the diarylalkanes of this invention are obtained by<br>
synthetic methods. Included in this invention is a method of synthesizing diarylalkanes and diarylalkanols said method comprising reducing a compound having the following general structure:<br>
wherein<br>
R1-R5 and R'1-R'5 and n are as defined above and wherein R6 and R7 together form one or more carbonyl group(s). The reducing agent can be selected from any known reducing agent for the reduction of ketones to alcohols including, but not limited to borohydrides, H2 in the presence of a catalyst, NaH dnd LiAIH4. In one embodiment the reducing agent is NaBH4-<br>
[0071]	In yet another embodiment, the diarylalkanes are obtained by synthetic<br>
modification of a naturally occurring compound isolated from a plant source. For example, the naturally occurring compound butein is isolated from a plant source, dehydrated and reduced to yield the corresponding diarytalkanol.<br>
[0072]	In yet another embodiment, the diarylalkanes are obtained by the reaction of<br>
two appropriately substituted aromatic compounds. Feasible chemical reactions for<br>

WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
synthesizing these compounds from two substituted aromatic compounds include, but are not limited to Aldol condensation between a substituted benzaldehyde and a substituted acetophenone; Claisen-Schmidt reaction or crossed aldol condensation between an aldehyde and a ketone; Grignard reaction using an organomagnesium halide of one substituted aromatic ring to link the second substituted aromatic ring through addition reaction to the carbonyl group on the molecule; Claisen rearrangement by an intra-molecular isomerization, in which an esterlfied phenol with appropriate substitution groups will be isomerized to link the second aromatic rings at the ortho-position of the phenol followed by a reducing reaction; and a Suzuki coupling reaction, in which two substituted aromatic rings are converted to arylboronic acids and then linked by an alkyl halide by using a carefully selected palladium catalyst. These reactions are well known to those of skill in the art and the conditions for such reactions can be determined using the information disclosed herein for the synthesis of these compounds.<br>

[0074]	The present invention implements a strategy that combines a tyrosinase<br>
inhibition assay with a chemical dereplication process to identify active plant extracts and the particular compounds within those extracts that specifically inhibit the binuclear enzyme tyrosinase. As noted above, enzymes that inhibit tyrosinase may lead to a reduction in the production of melanin thereby effectively lightening the skin. A library of plant extracts was generated by extracting dry plant powders with an organic solvent, as described in Example 1. The tyrosinase inhibition assay was developed following a method reported by Jones et al. (2002) Pigment. Cell Res. 15:335, as described in Example 2. Using this assay, a total of 1144 plant extracts were screened for their ability to inhibit the activity of mushroom tyrosinase. This primary screen identified 20 plant extracts (1.75% hit rate) with potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Table 1 delineates percent inhibition of tyrosinase by four of these extracts isolated from four different genera.<br>
[0075]	In order to efficiently identify active compounds from the active plant extracts,<br>
a high throughput fractionation process was used, as described in Example 3. Briefly, the active extracts were fractionated using a high throughput purification (HTP) system. Each of the fractions was then tested for its ability to inhibit tyrosinase activity as per the primary assay described in Example 2. After dereplication, using a combination of HPLC with PDA and MS detectors coupled with a structure database search and elimination of fractions that contained known tyrosinase inhibitors, such as polyphenols and chromones, a total of seven<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2005/117849	PC T/US2005/018884<br>
active extracts were chosen for bioassay guided large-scale isolation and purification as<br>
described in Examples 4-6, using the extracts of Broussonetia kazinoki Sieb. Et Zucc<br>
(Moraceae), and Dianella ensifolia (L.) DC. (Liliaceae) for purposes of illustration.<br>
[0076]	Example 4 describes the extraction, separation and purification of the novel<br>
diarylpropane: l-(2-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyI)-3-(2'-hydroxy-5I-methoxyphenyl)-propane (UP288) (1) from Broussonetia kazinoki Sieb. Et Zucc (Moraceae) (whole plant) using the general method set forth in Examples 1-3. Figure 4 illustrates the HPLCAJV chromatogram of a HTP fraction that contains the UP288. The structure of the active compound UP288 was elucidated using a combination of spectroscopic methods as set forth in Example 4. Figure 5 depicts the chemical structure and I3C-NMR spectrum of UP288. Figure 6 illustrates tyrosinase inhibitory dose response curves and IC50 values for UP288 relative to kojic acid. The figure illustrates that UP288 (1) is as potent a tyrosinase inhibitor as kojic acid, having an IC5o=24 µM.<br>
[0077]	Surprisingly, two similar diarylalkanes were isolated and identified from a<br>
totally different family of plant - Dianelia ensifolia (L.) DC. (Liliaceae), as described in Example 5. Figure 7 depicts schematically the bio assay-guided isolation of these two active compounds (UP302a (2) and UP302b (3)) from Dianella ensifolia (P0389) (whole plant). With reference to Figure 7, it can be seen that only fifteen column fractions from a total of 264 collected samples exhibited potent inhibition of tyrosinase. A HPLC analysis (Figure 8) of the combined active fractions showed that active compounds were minor components in the best pool, which has already been heavily enriched. Laborious separation and purification efforts yielded two novel active compounds that have been fully characterized by NMR and other spectroscopic methods as illustrated in Example 5 and Figure 9 as l-(3-methyl-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(2',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-propane (UP302a, IC50=O.24 µM) (2) and l-(3-metbyl-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(2',5'-dihydroxyphenyI)-propane (IP302b, IC50=1.2µM)(3).<br>
[0078]	Example 6 describes the large-scale isolation of UP302a (2), the most potent<br>
tyrosinase inhibitor, isolated from Dianella ensifolia (DE) (whole plant). With reference to Example 6, from 4.3 kg of dried biomass, a total of 30 mg of pure UP302a (2) was obtained after multiple column fractionations on silica gel, CG-161, and C-3 8 resins. The structure and biological function of the isolated compound were confirmed.<br>
[0079]	Due to the low natural abundance of diarylalkanes/diarylalkanols, methods to<br>
synthesize these biologically active compounds, as an alternative commercial source of this class of compounds was developed. Example 7 describes a general method for the synthesis<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
of diarylalkanes via the reduction of substituted chalcones. For purposes of illustration the<br>
reduction of 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3',4'-dimethoxyphenylchaIcone (4) to l-(2,4-<br>
dihydroxyphenyl)-3-(3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl)-l-propanol (5) using sodium borohydride is<br>
described. However, as set forth in Example 7, a number of other diarylalkanes have been<br>
synthesized using this general method. All of the compounds synthesized showed high to<br>
moderate tyrosinase inhibitory activity. With respect to the general method described in<br>
Example 7, any other known reducing agents, can be used to effect this reduction, including,<br>
but are not limited to other borohydrides, H2 in the presence of a catalyst, NaH and LiAIH4.<br>
[0080]	Using the general reaction described in Example 7, several other substituted<br>
diarylpropanones have been converted to diarylpropanes and/or diarylpropanols as demonstrated in Examples 8, 9 and 10. Example 11 demonstrates the synthesis of a diarylpropanol using a flavonoid glycoside isolated from a natural source as the starting material.<br>
[0081]	In another embodiment, the present invention includes methods for<br>
synthesizing this class of compounds by reaction of two appropriately substituted aromatic compounds. This embodiment is illustrated in Example 12, using the reaction of resorcino! with 3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for purposes of illustration. Feasible chemical reactions for synthesizing these compounds from two substituted aromatic compounds include, but are not limited to Aldol condensation between a substituted benzaldehyde and a substituted acetophenone; Claisen-Schmidt reaction or crossed aldol condensation between an aldehyde and a ketone; Grignard reaction using an organomagnesium halide of one substituted aromatic ring to link the second substituted aromatic ring through addition reaction to the carbonyl group on the molecule; Claisen rearrangement by an intra-molecuiar isomerization, in which an esterified phenol with appropriate substitution groups will be isomerized to link the second aromatic rings at the ortho-position of the phenol followed by a reducing reaction; and a Suzuki coupling reaction, in which two substituted aromatic rings are converted to arylboronic acids and then linked by an alkyl halide by using a carefully selected palladium catalyst. These reactions are well known to those of skill in the ait and the conditions for such reactions can be determined using the information disclosed herein for the synthesis' of these compounds.<br>
[0082]	Example 13 sets forth the IC50 values for a number of diarylalkanes and<br>
diarylalkanols synthesized according the methods of this invention. The compounds were evaluated using the general method described in Example 2. The IC50 value of each sample was calculated using kinetics software to verify that the reaction was linear at a specified time<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
and concentration. Using the methods described in Examples 7-12 a total of 24 compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit tyrosinase. The results are set forth in Table 2. With reference to Table 2, it can be seen that 1 he IC5o's of the synthetic diarylalkanols were comparable to the naturally occurring diarylpropanes. Thus, these two classes of compounds are capable of inhibiting tyrosinase to approximately the same extent. The most active diarylalkanes and/or diarylalkanols had th .ee carbons between the two aromatic rings. Using the calculations described in Example 17, this structural feature was demonstrated to be critical in order to generate a parallel a nd superimposed intra-molecular conformations. However, diarylalkanols, which containec1 two and four carbons between the two aromatic rings, such as l-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-l-ethanol (IC50 = 77 µM) and l,4-bis~(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2,3-dimethyl-buthane (IC50 = 700 µM) also were able to significantly inhibit tyrosinase activity.<br>
[0083]	Using the method described in Example 2. the inhibition of tryosinase by<br>
UP302a (2) was evaluated using L-DOPA as the substrate as set forth in Example 14. The results are set forth in Figure 10. This study revealed that UP302a (2) is a powerful competitive inhibitor having a long lasting effect Interestingly, tyrosinase activity was not resumed for several days after incubation with UP302a. In contrast, tyrosinase activity was totally restored after only 1 hour following incubation with kojic acid. Since two of the substituents on the aromatic rings of UP302a were methoxy groups, the inhibitor cannot be easily hydroxylated and/or oxidized. This may explain both the effectiveness and duration of the inhibitory activity of UP302a. Thus, it can be concluded that these compounds will have a long lasting effect.<br>
[0084]	The efficacy of the claimed composition was also demonstrated by measuring<br>
the inhibition of melanin produced in an in vitro test on a B-l 6 cell line as described in<br>
Example 15. The results are set forth in Figure 11. The reduction of endogenous melanin by<br>
UP302a (2) was almost six fold greater than that of kojic acid. Additionally, inhibition of<br>
MSH induced melanin production by UP302a was also significantly greater than kojic acid.<br>
As expected, UP288 (1) was comparable to kojic acid in the B-l 6 cell line model.<br>
[0085]	Example 16 describes an assay to assess the cytotoxicity of two<br>
diary lpropanes UP288 (1) and UP302a (2) relative to kojic acid. At a concentration of 250 µM, which was above IC50 of all three tested compounds, the diary lpropanes demonstrated similar safety profiles to that of kojic acid.<br>
[0086]	Example 17 describes the molecular modeling analyses performed to<br>
determine the most stable 3-D conformation of the active diarylalkanes and diarylalkanols.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
Molecular mechanics calculations were performed using Chem3D software. These<br>
calculations revealed that the most potent tyrosinase inhibitor - 1 -(3-methyl-2,4-<br>
dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(2',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-propane (UP302a (2), IC50=0.24 u.M) has a very<br>
unique 3-dimentional conformation with two the aromatic rings superimposed on each other<br>
as illustrated in Figure 12. The minimized total energy for the conformation is -4.7034<br>
KJ/Mol and the distance between the two aromatic rings is 3.28 A. The phenolic hydroxyi<br>
groups on the first aromatic ring are right above the two methoxy groups on the second<br>
aromatic ring with the distance between two oxygen atoms being as 2.99 A and 3.16 A,<br>
respectively as illustrated in Figure 14. The active site of the binuclear enzyme tyrosinase<br>
has two copper ions complexed to an oxygen molecule in a peroxide oxidation state [CµM-<br>
O2-Cu11], which is key to the mechanism by which tyrosinase catalyzes the introduction of a<br>
hydroxyi group in the ortho position of the aromatic ring of a mono-phenol (such as<br>
tyrosine). (Decker et al. (2000) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39: 1591). The interactomic distances<br>
were reported as 3.56 A for Cu-Cu, 1.90 A for Cu-0 and 1.41 AforO-O. (Kitajima el al.<br>
(1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:8975). The parallel conformation of l-(3-methyl-2,4-<br>
dimcthoxyphenyI)-3-(2',4'~dihydroxyphenyl)-propane (UP302a, IC50=O.24 µM) will perfectly<br>
chelate with both copper ions of the [Cu11-O2-Cu11] complex from both the top and the bottom<br>
as illustrated in Figures 13 and 14. This dual chelation by the inhibitor to both copper ions at<br>
the active site will totally block the access of the substrate, such as L-Dopa to the enzyme,<br>
thus effectively inhibiting the function of the protein. Using the same approach, the isolated<br>
and synthetic diarylalkanes and diarylalkanols listed in Table 2 were analyzed. The results of<br>
this analysis indicated that the compounds with twisted or non-parallel conformations<br>
possessed either no ability or only a weak ability to inhibit the activity of tyrosinase.<br>
[0087]	From these studies it has been determined that the most effective diarylalkane<br>
inhibitors have two to three substituents on one aromatic ring and zero to multiple substituents on the second aromatic ring. The most favorable structures are those in which at least one aromatic ring is substituted in the 2 and 4-positions. Preferably the rings are 6-membered aromatic and/or heteroaromaric as demonstrated by two of the compounds isolated 1 -(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyI)-3-(2',3',4',5'-tetrahydro-bezo(b)dioxocin-8-yI)-l -propanol -IC50 = 72 µM and 3-(5'-chloro-l'-methyl-l '-hydro-imidazol-2'-y!)-1 -(2-hydroxy-4-' methoxyphenyl)-l -propanol - IC50 = 225 µM.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Preparation of Organic Extracts from Dry Plants<br>
[00101]	Dried plant material was ground to a particle size of no larger than 2 mm and a<br>
portion (60 g) was transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and extracted with 600 ml of methanol:dichloromethane (1:1). The mixture was shaken for one hour, filtered and the biomass was extracted again with methanohdichloromethane (1:1) (600 ml). The organic extracts were combined and evaporated under vacuum to provide an organic extract from each plant material. Each extract (approximately 75 mg) was then dissolved in 1.5 ml DMSO<br>

PCT/US2005/018884<br><br>
to a concentration of 50 mg/ml, which was then stored in a -700C freezer. An aliquot of the extract solution was used for tyrosinase assay as described in Example 2.<br>
Example 2. Tyrosinase Inhibition Assay<br>
[00102]	A tyrosinase inhibition assay was carried out using the method reported by<br>
Jones ei al. (2002) Pigment. Cell Res. 15:335. Using this method, the conversion of L-Dopa, a substrate of tyrosinase, into dopachrome is followed by monitoring absorption at 450 nm. Tyrosinase was prepared in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (assay buffer) at 2000 U/ml and stored at -20° C in 1 ml aliquots prior to use. For use in assays, stock enzyme solutions were thawed and diluted to 200 U/ml with assay buffer. A 2 mM working solution of substrate, L-DOPA, was prepared in assay buffer for each assay. Samples were dissolved in 10% DMSO (0.5 ml) and diluted to 5 ml with assay buffer. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.050 ml 2 mM L-DOPA, 0.050 ml 200U/ml mushroom tyrosinase and 0.050 ml inhibitor. Reaction volume was adjusted to 200 µl with assay buffer. Assays were performed in 96 well Falcon 3097 flat-bottom microtiter plates (Beckton Dickinson, NJ).

Example 3. HTP Practionation of Active Plant Extracts<br>
[00103]	Active organic extract (400 mg) was loaded onto a prepacked, normal phase,<br>
flash column. (2 cm ID x 8.2 cm, lOg silica gel). The column was eluted using a Hitachi high throughput purification (HTP) system with a gradient mobile phase of (A) 50:50 EtOAc:hexane and (B) methanol from 100% A to 100% B in 30 minutes at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. The separation was monitored using a broadband wavelength UV detector and the fractions were collected in a 96-deep-well piate at 1.9 mL/well using a Gilson fraction collector. The sample plate was dried under low vacuum and centrifugation. DMSO (1.5 mL) was used to dissolve the samples in each cell and a portion (100 uL) was taken for the tyrosinase inhibition assay in duplicate.<br>

[00104]	Broussonetia kazinoki (100 g whole plant) was ground and extracted three<br>
times with 800 ml of MeOH:DCM (1:2). Dried extract (6 g) was fractionated using a silica gel column with gradient solvent elution of hexane/ethyl acetate (50/50) to MeOH. Fractions were collected in 2 sets of 88 test tubes. LC/MS/PDA was utilized to check each of the fractions, which were then combined based on the similarity of their composition. The combined fractions were evaporated to remove solvent, dried and their tyrosinase inhibition activity measured as described in Example 2. It was found that fractions (P0346-HTP-F2 -P0346-HTP-F4) were the most active and these fractions were combined and labeled as BK-F2--4. After solvent evaporation, BK-F2-4 was further separated on a pre-packed reverse phase column (C-18 column) using a water/MeOH gradient. Eighteen compound peaks were observed following separation. Fourteen reverse phase columns were performed and the similar fractions from each run were combined. One compound peak referred to as UP288 in the combined and enriched fraction showed strong tyrosinase inhibition activity (Figure 4). After separation and purification with preparative HPLC, 6 mg of I-(2-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methoxyphenyl)-propane (UP288) (1) was obtained.

Example 15. Inhibition of Melanin Production From B-16 Cell line<br>
[00122]	The inhibition of melanin production was evaluated using two different<br>
assays. In the first assay, the inhibition of melanin production was evaluated without<br>
induction by p-MSH; whereas in the second assay the inhibition of melanin production was<br>
measured with p-MSH induction in cell culture medium. Briefly, B16 Fl cells (ATCC#<br>
CRL-622) were grown to confluency and then seeded at 40,000 cells per well. The cells were<br>
allowed to attach overnight at 37°C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. On day<br>
2, inhibitors were added to the cells at concentrations ranging from 0-1000 µM in triplicate<br>
and allowed to incubate for four days. The amount of ß-MSH required to induce melanin<br>
formation was determined by the addition of hormone at concentrations ranging from 0-1000<br>
nM in ten-fold increments. Once the proper p-MSH concentration was determined, cells<br>
were seeded as above, allowed to attach overnight and then co-incubated with tyrosinase<br>
inhibitors at concentrations ranging from 0-1000 µM. Color development was visually<br>
monitored each morning. After the development of color, 200 µl of cell supernatant was<br>
removed from each well and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The resulting readings<br>
were used to determine the IC50 for melanin formation in the cell assay with and without p-<br>
MSH induction. For an initial comparison of cell toxicity, the 250 µM treated wells were<br>
used to perform a lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH). LDH is a metabolic enzyme that leaks<br>
out of damaged or dead cells. The enzyme converts a chromophore in the presence of NAD+<br>
to yield a color change that can be moniiored spectrophotometrically.<br>
[00123]	The results of this assay revealed that all of the natural inhibitors tested<br>
(UP288, UP302a, and UP302b) are at least as good, if not better inhibitors than kojic acid. There were some differences in the IC50 values under the two sets of conditions. Inhibition by kojic acid improved from an IC50 of 170 µM for the endogenous experiment to an IC50 of 67 µM in the induced experiment. Of the inhibitors tested relative to kojic acid, compound UP302b was only one that that showed an increase in IC50 under the two sets of conditions increasing from an IC50 of 5.2 |iM to an IC50 of 34 µM. The IC50's measured for inhibition of tyrosinase were relatively the same for all of the compounds tested with the exception of the two compounds UP302 and UP302b, which had low IC5o's of 0.2 µM and 0.3 µM, respectively, compared to 28 µM and 5.2 µM in the endogenous assay and 40 µM and 34 µM in the induced assay. These differences may be due to decreased cell penetration by UP302a (2) and UP302b (3), as compared to the other inhibitors. This is overcome, however by the strength of their inhibition of the enzyme.<br>

At this concentration none of these compounds are significantly more cytotoxic than kojic acid. It should be noted however, that cytotoxicity at only one concentration (250 µM) was tested. As shown in the Table 3, UP288 (1) and UP302a (2) showed moderate cytotoxicity, which were comparable with kojic acid.<br>

Example 17. Molecular Mechanics fMM2) Calculation<br>
[00126]	Molecular mechanics calculations were performed using Chem3D software for<br>
purposes of energy minimization and deiermination of the most stable 3-D conformation. The following parameters were used: Step interval = 2.0fs, frame interval = lOfs, terminate after 10,000 steps, heating/cooling rate = 1.000 Kcal/atom/PS, target temperature = 3000K. Properties: pi bond orders and steric energy summary. All natural and synthetic compounds and other diarylalkane and diarylalkanol structures were analyzed. It was found that the most potent tyrosinase inhibitor - l-(3-methyl-2,4-diniethoxyphenyl)-3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-propane (UP302a (2), IC5o=0.24 µM) - isolated from whole plants of Dianella ensifolia (L.) DC. has a very unique 3-dimentional conformation in which the two aromatic rings were superimposed on each other. The minimized lotal energy for the conformation is -4.7034 KJ/Mol. The distance between the two aromatic rings was 3.28 A. The phenolic hydroxyl groups on the first aromatic ring were right above the two methoxyl groups on the second aromatic ring with the distance between two oxygen atoms being 2.99 and 3.16 A,<br>
respectively as illustrated in Figures 12-14. This intramolecular parallel conformation allows<br>

WO 2005/117849	PCT/US2005/018884<br>
this compound to perfectly chelate both copper ions of the binuclear enzyme when it is in the peroxide form [Cu11-O2-Cull] from both the top and the bottom.<br>
Example 18. Formulation of the Diarylalkane Composition into a Cream<br>
[00127]	UP302a is comprised of a substituted diarylpropane as the major active<br>
component. These compounds are soluble in high polarity solvents including, but not limited<br>
to ethanol, propylene glycol and ethylene glycol. They can be formulated with a<br>
pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable excipient, an adjuvant, and/or a carrier.<br>
Examples of such excipients include, but are not limited to water, buffers, saline, Ringer's<br>
solution, dextrose solution, mannitol, Hank's solution, preservatives and other aqueous<br>
physiologically balanced salt solutions. Nonaqueous vehicles including, but not limited to<br>
fixed oils, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, or triglycerides may also be used. Other useful<br>
formulations include, but are not limited to suspensions containing viscosity enhancing<br>
agents, including, but not limited to sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol, or dextran.<br>
Excipients can also contain minor amounts of additives or preservatives, such as antioxidants<br>
that enhance color and chemical stability. UP302 also can be prepared in a liposome<br>
formulation to increase its skin penetration or as a controlled release formulation, which<br>
slowly releases the composition of the active ingredient into the host.<br>
[00128]	UP302a is preferably administered topically as an ointment, gel, lotion, or<br>
cream base or as an emulsion, a patch, dressing or mask, a nonsticking gauze, a bandage, a swab or a cloth wipe. Such topical application can be locally administered to any affected area, using any standard means known for topical administration. UP302 can be administered to both humans and animals.<br>
[00129]	A therapeutic composition of UP302a can be administered in a variety of unit<br>
dosage forms depending upon the method of administration and targeted indications. An efficacious, nontoxic quantity is generally recommended in the range of 0.01 % to 5% based on total weight of the topical formulation. Two different concentrations of UP302a(0.01% and 0.5% by weight) were formulated in creams as illustrated in Tables 4 and 5. To prepare these creams the diarylalkane was dissolved in water at room temperature and homogenized in a blender until it was fully dispersed in solution (approximately 5 minutes) to yield a composition A. At room temperature and without stirring or agitating, Ultrez-21 carbomer was added to the homogenized solution by sprinkling it onto the surface and allowing it to fully wet (no white areas visible) and fall into the solution. With gentle stirring, the solution was then heated to 40°C and glycerin was added and the composition was mixed for an<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2005/117849<br><br>
PCT/US2005/018884<br><br>
additional 5 minutes to provide Composition B. At 40°C, Composition A is added to Composition B and the composition is mixed well until homogenous (approximately 5 minutes). The resulting emulsion is cooled to 30°C and the pH adjusted to approximately 5,5 (5.3 to 5.7) by titrating with neutralizer while stirring with a stir bar and/or spatula. The emulsion became highly viscous due to the neutralization-induced conformational change of the carbomer. Upon stirring the emulsion will achieved a suitable viscosity for an emulsion cream. The composition was mixed until uniform, poured into clean storage vessels and stored at 2°C to 8°C.<br>
