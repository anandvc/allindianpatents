Namely, the present invention provides a process for producing 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-(4-methyl-2-pentenoyl)-2-pyrone which comprises allowing 2,3-dihydro-7-methyl-2-(l-methylethyl) -4H, 5H-pyrano[4,3-b]pyran-4,5-dione to react with at least one inorganic compound selected from alkali hydroxides, alkaline earth hydroxides, alkali carbonates, alkaline earth carbonates and alkali fluorides in an alcohol, water or a mixture thereof.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention The process of the present invention is carried out in an alcohol, water or a mixture thereof.<br>
Examples of the alcohol used for the reaction include lower alcohols, for example, C1-C5 alcohols. Typical examples eire methanol, ethanol, 2-propanoland2-methyl-2-propanol. Amixture of the lower alcohol with water can be utilized as well as a mixture of two or more of the lower alcohols.<br>
In the present invention, the other solvent that is inert to the reaction of the present invention can be used together.<br><br>
Therefore, the phrase "in an alcohol, water or a mixtiore thereof" means " in the presence of at least one solvent selected from alcohols and water, and the amount of the solvent is enough for dissolving the inorganic compound selected from alkali hydroxides, alkaline earth hydroxides, alkali carbonates, alkaline earth carbonates and alkali fluorides." The amount of the solvent selected from alcohols and water is usually 1ml to 1000ml based on Ig of 2.3-dihydro-7-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-4H.5H-pyrano[4,3-b] pyran-4,5-dione.<br>
Examples of the inert solvent include aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g. hexane), aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene), ketones (e.g. methyl isobutyl ketone), esters (e.g. ethyl acetate), ethers (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether), amides (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide), halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g. chloroform), dimethyl sulfoxide, aliphatic nitriles (e.g. acetonitrile), tertiary amines (e.g. triethylamine) and nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycles (e.g. pyridine).<br>
Examples of the alkali hydroxide include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, and examples of the alkaline earth hydroxide include magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide. In the present invention, alkali carbonate means normal salt of alkali metal carbonate. Therefore, examples of the alkali carbonate include lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Examples of the alkaline earth carbonate include magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate and barium carbonate. Examples of the alkali fluoride include cesium fluoride.<br>
An amount of the alkali hydroxides, alkaline earth hydroxides, alkali carbonates alkaline earth carbonates or alkali metal fluorides used for the reaction is- usually 1 to 10 moles, preferable 1 to 5 moles against 1 mole of a starting material, 2,3-dihydro-7-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-4H,5H-pyrano[4,3-b] pyran-4,5-dione.<br>
The reaction temperature for the process of the invention<br><br>
is usually -20 to lOO'C, provided that it is usually under a boiling point of a solvent when the boiling point of the solvent used for<br>
the reaction is below 100^3. The reaction period varies depending on the other reaction conditions and it is usually momentary to 24 hours.<br>
The starting material for the process of the invention, 2,3-dihydro-7-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-4H,5H-pyrano[4,3-b] pyran-4,5-dione, can be prepared by a condensation reaction of dehydroacetic acid with isobutyraldehyde in the presence of piperidine in chloroform according to the description of Chemistry and Industry pp. 1306-1307 (1969).<br>
Further, 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-(4-methyl-2-pentenoyl)-2-pyrone obtained by the process of the invention can be subjected to a reduction, such as hydrogenat ion in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, to give 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-{4-niethylpentanoyl)-2-pyrone that is useful as an active ingredient of insecticides.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-(4-methyl-2-pentenoyI)-2-pyrone which comprises allowing 2,3-dihydro-7-methyl-2-(l-methylethyl)-4H,5H-pyrano[4,3-b]pyran-4,5-dione to react with at least one inorganic compound selected from alkali hydroxides, alkaline earth hydroxides, alkali carbonates, alkaline earth carbonates and alkali fluorides in an alcohol, water or a mixture thereof at -20 to lOO^C, acidifying the reaction mixture and isolating the product in a known manner.<br><br>
