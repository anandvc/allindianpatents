				<td>FUEL CELL SYSTEM AND START-UP METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell system and, more<br>
particularly, to a method for starting the fuel cell system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A fuel cell has been proposed as a clean, efficient and<br>
environmentally responsible power source for electric vehicles and various other<br>
applications. In particular, the fuel cell has been identified as a potential<br>
alternative for a traditional internal-combustion engine used in modem vehicles.<br>
[0003] A common type of fuel cell is known as a proton exchange<br>
membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell includes three basic components:<br>
a cathode, an anode and an electrolyte membrane. The cathode and anode<br>
typically include a finely divided catalyst, such as platinum, supported on carbon<br>
particles and mixed with an ionomer. The electrolyte membrane is sandwiched<br>
between the cathode and the anode to form a membrane-electrode-assembly<br>
(MEA). The MEA is often disposed between porous diffusion media (DM) which<br>
facilitate a delivery of gaseous reactants, typically hydrogen and oxygen from air,<br>
for an electrochemical fuel cell reaction. Individual fuel cells can be stacked<br>
together in series to form a fuel cell stack. The fuel cell stack is capable of<br>
generating a quantity of electricity sufficient to power a vehicle.<br>
[0004] During periods of non-operation, a quantity of air diffuses into<br>
and accumulates in the anodes of the fuel cell stack. Upon start-up of the fuel<br>
cell stack, hydrogen is supplied to the anodes. The hydrogen displaces the air<br>
and creates a "hydrogen-air front" that passes over the anodes. The hydrogen-<br>
air front is known to degrade carbon in the electrodes and impact fuel cell<br>
performance. In particular, the presence of both hydrogen and air on the anode<br>
results in a localized electrical short between a portion of the anode that sees<br>
hydrogen and a portion of the anode that sees air. The localized electrical short<br>
causes a cell reversal, resulting in a rapid corrosion of the catalyst support. The<br><br>
rate of carbon corrosion has been found to be proportional to a time that the<br>
hydrogen-air front exists and a magnitude of the localized voltage at the<br>
hydrogen-air front.<br>
[0005] It is known in the art to rapidly purge the anodes of the<br>
accumulated air with hydrogen and minimize the time that the hydrogen-air front<br>
exists on the anodes. The purge is often designed to substantially and evenly fill<br>
the anode inlet header with hydrogen without exhausting an excess of hydrogen<br>
from the fuel cell system. An illustrative purge method is disclosed in applicant's<br>
co-pending U.S. App. Serial No. 11/762,845, incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety. Typically, a time required to purge the anodes is calculated in<br>
advance, based on the volume of the fuel cell stack and the flow rate of the<br>
hydrogen. However, the quantity of air that has accumulated on the anodes<br>
varies with different shut-down periods and conditions. Additionally, variations in<br>
pressure, pressure measurements, flow rates, flow control and composition of<br>
the gases on the anodes after shut-down periods may vary widely. Therefore,<br>
the time required to displace the accumulated air from the anodes, as well as the<br>
volume and flow rate of hydrogen for purging the anodes, is generally not<br>
optimized. As the optimal end point of the purge is often difficult to predict,<br>
systems of the art have been unable to fully purge the anodes with hydrogen<br>
without exhausting an undesirable quantity of hydrogen to the atmosphere.<br>
[0006] Known systems have also employed a dead-short circuit<br>
method during start-up of the fuel cell stack. In dead-short systems, a circuit with<br>
a shorting resistor, for example, is used to minimize the localized voltage during<br>
start-up of the fuel cell stack. The rate of carbon corrosion during start-up of the<br>
fuel cell stack is thereby minimized. In order for the dead-short system to work<br>
properly, however, each fuel cell in the fuel cell stack must have substantially<br>
equal quantities of hydrogen for the duration of the dead-short. A fuel cell that is<br>
deficient in hydrogen may experience undesirable, localized conditions if<br>
subjected to the dead-short.<br>
[0007] There is a continuing need for a fuel cell system and method<br>
that provides a rapid and reliable start-up. Desirably, the fuel cell system and<br><br>
method militates against an excessive exhaust of hydrogen during start-up,<br>
enables the employment of a dead-short method to minimize carbon corrosion,<br>
and militates against undesirable effects to the fuel cell stack resulting from the<br>
dead-short circuit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] In concordance with the instant disclosure, a fuel cell system<br>
and method that provides desirable fuel cell system emissions, optimizes the<br>
hydrogen-air front time during the start-up, and enables the employment of a<br>
dead-short circuit for minimization of carbon corrosion, is surprisingly discovered.<br>
[0009] In one embodiment, a fuel cell system is provided. The fuel cell<br>
system includes a fuel cell stack having a plurality of fuel cells, and an anode<br>
supply manifold in fluid communication with the anodes of the plurality of fuel<br>
cells. The anode supply manifold is adapted to deliver an anode supply stream<br>
to the plurality of fuel cells. The fuel cell system further includes an anode<br>
exhaust manifold in fluid communication with the anodes of the plurality of fuel<br>
cells and adapted to receive an anode exhaust stream from the plurality of fuel<br>
cells. A pressure sensor is in communication with the fuel cell stack and adapted<br>
to measure an anode pressure. The fuel cell system has a first and second valve<br>
in fluid communication with the anode supply and exhaust manifolds,<br>
respectively. The first and second valves are adapted to operate at a<br>
predetermined anode pressure measured by the pressure sensor.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, a method for starting the fuel cell<br>
system is provided. The method first includes the steps of providing the first<br>
valve in one of an open position and a closed position, and providing the second<br>
valve in a closed position. An anode supply stream is supplied to the anode<br>
supply manifold. The first valve is then opened, if it is not already provided in an<br>
open position, and a first quantity of air from the anode supply manifold is<br>
exhausted therethrough. An anode pressure is monitored while the first quantity<br>
of air is exhausted. The first valve is closed when the anode pressure indicates a<br>
flow of the anode supply stream therethrough, for example, when the anode<br><br>
pressure is less than a predetermined pressure value. The second valve is then<br>
opened and a second quantity of air is exhausted from the anode exhaust<br>
manifold through the second valve until the anode supply stream flows through<br>
the second valve.<br>
[0011] In a further embodiment, a flow rate of the anode supply stream<br>
is at least one of controlled and measured during the step of supplying the anode<br>
supply stream. The method may further include the steps of measuring a<br>
pressure differential across the first valve, and calculating an anode pressure<br>
from the pressure differential and the flow rate of the anode supply stream. The<br>
first valve is then closed when the anode pressure is less than a predetermined<br>
pressure value.<br>
[0012] The method of the disclosure may further include a step of<br>
activating a dead-short when the second valve is opened. An average voltage of<br>
the fuel cell stack is maintained at substantially zero. After filling the anodes with<br>
the anode supply stream, the dead-short of the fuel cell stack may be deactivated<br>
and a cathode supply stream supplied to a cathode inlet manifold. The start-up<br>
of the fuel cell system is thereby completed.<br>

[0013] The above, as well as other advantages of the present<br>
disclosure, will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the<br>
following detailed description, particularly when considered in the light of the<br>
drawings described hereafter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also<br>
be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. In respect of the methods<br>
disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, are not<br>
necessary or critical.<br>
[0019] FIG. 1 depicts a bipolar PEM fuel cell stack 2 having a pair of<br>
MEAs 4, 6 separated from each other by an electrically conductive bipolar plate<br>
8. For simplicity, only a two-cell stack (i.e. one bipolar plate) is illustrated and<br>
described in FIG. 1, it being understood that a typical fuel cell stack will have<br>
many more such cells and bipolar plates. The MEAs 4, 6 and bipolar plate 8 are<br>
stacked together between a pair of clamping plates 10, 12 and a pair of unipolar<br>
end plates 14,16. The clamping plates 10,12 are electrically insulated from the<br>
end plates 14, 16 by a gasket or a dielectric coating (not shown). The unipolar<br>
end plates 14, 16, as well as both working faces of the bipolar plate 8, include<br>
flowfields 18, 20, 22, 24 for distributing a hydrogen gas and air over an anode<br>
and a cathode, respectively, of the MEAs 4, 6. Nonconductive gaskets 26, 28,<br>
30, 32 provide seals and an electrical insulation between the several components<br>
of the fuel cell stack 2. Gas-permeable diffusion media 34, 36, 38, 40 are<br>
adjacent the electrodes, such as the anodes and the cathodes, of the MEAs 4, 6.<br>
The end plates 14, 16 are disposed adjacent to the diffusion media 34, 40,<br>
respectively, while the bipolar plate 8 is disposed adjacent to the diffusion media .<br>
36 on the anode face of MEA 4. The bipolar plate 8 is further disposed adjacent<br>
to the diffusion (media 38 on the cathode face of MEA 6.<br>
[0020] The illustrative two-cell, bipolar PEM fuel cell stack 2 further<br>
includes a cathode supply manifold 72 and a cathode exhaust manifold 74, a<br><br>
coolant supply manifold 75 and a coolant exhaust manifold 77, and an anode<br>
supply manifold 76 and an anode exhaust manifold 78. The hydrogen gas is<br>
supplied to the anode supply manifold 76 via an anode inlet conduit 80. The air<br>
is supplied to the cathode supply manifold 72 of the fuel cell stack 2 via a<br>
cathode inlet conduit 82. An anode outlet conduit 84 and a cathode outlet<br>
conduit 86 are also provided for the anode exhaust manifold 78 and the cathode<br>
exhaust manifold 74, respectively. A coolant inlet conduit 88 and a coolant outlet<br>
conduit 90 are further provided for supplying liquid coolant to, and removing<br>
coolant from, respectively, the coolant inlet manifold 75 and the coolant outlet<br>
manifold 77. It should be understood that the configurations of the various inlets<br>
80, 82, 88 and outlets 84, 86, 90 in FIG. 1 are for the purpose of illustration, and<br>
other configurations may be chosen as desired.<br>
[0021] FIG. 2 shows a fuel cell system 200 according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The fuel cell system 200 includes the fuel cell<br>
stack 2 having a plurality of fuel cells 202. Each of the plurality of fuel cells 202<br>
has an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte membrane disposed<br>
therebetween. The fuel cell stack 2 further has a first end 204 and a second end<br>
206. In particular embodiments, the first end 204 is known as the "dry end" and<br>
the second end 206 is known as the "wet end."<br>
[0022] The fuel cell system 200 includes the anode supply manifold 76<br>
in communication with the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202. The anode<br>
supply manifold 76 is adapted to deliver an anode supply stream 208, such as<br>
gaseous hydrogen, to the plurality of fuel cells 202. The fuel cell system 200<br>
further includes an anode exhaust manifold 78 in communication with the anodes<br>
of the plurality of fuel cells 202. The anode exhaust manifold 78 is adapted to<br>
receive an anode exhaust stream, such as residual gaseous hydrogen, air, and<br>
water, from the plurality of fuel cells 202.<br>
[0023] The fuel cell system 200 further includes a first valve 210 in fluid<br>
communication with the anode supply manifold 76. A second valve 212 is in fluid<br>
communication with the anode exhaust manifold 78. In one embodiment, the first<br>
valve 210 is disposed at the first end 204 of the fuel cell stack 2. The second<br><br>
valve 212 may be disposed at the second end 206 of the fuel cell stack 2. The<br>
first valve 210 is adapted to exhaust a first quantity of air 214 and the anode<br>
supply stream 208 from the anode supply manifold 76. The second valve 212 is<br>
adapted to exhaust a second quantity of air 216 and an anode exhaust stream<br>
from the anode exhaust manifold 78. In a further embodiment, the second valve<br>
212 is disposed at the first end 204 instead of the second end 206.<br>
[0024] It should be appreciated that when a sufficient period of time<br>
has elapsed between a shutdown operation of the fuel cell system 200 and a<br>
start-up operation, the first and second quantities of air 214, 216 will accumulate<br>
in the anode supply and exhaust manifolds 76, 78. Further, it should be<br>
appreciated that the first and second quantities of air 214, 216 will accumulate,<br>
during a sufficient period of stack inoperability, on the anodes of the plurality of<br>
fuel cells 202.<br>
[0025] In a particularly illustrative embodiment, the fuel cell system 200<br>
includes at least one pressure sensor adapted to measure a pressure of the<br>
anodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202. In one embodiment, the first valve 210 is<br>
in communication with a first pressure sensor 218. The second valve 212 may<br>
also be in communication with a second pressure sensor 220. As a nonlimiting<br>
example, at least one of the pressure sensors 218, 220 is a differential pressure<br>
sensor or AP sensor. Differential pressure sensors are known to accurately<br>
measure a pressure drop across a fixed orifice, such as the first and second<br>
valves 210, 212. Thus, the ambient pressure being assumed or otherwise<br>
known, the pressure of the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202 may be readily<br>
determined with the AP sensor. In particular embodiments, at least one of the<br>
pressure sensor 218, 220 is integral with at least one of the first and second<br>
valves 210, 212, respectively. One of ordinary skill in the art should also<br>
understand that suitable pressure sensors disposed at other locations within the<br>
fuel cell system 200 and adapted to measure the pressure of the anodes may be<br>
used as desired.<br>
[0026] In operation, the first valve 210 may be adapted to open or<br>
close at a first predetermined anode pressure. The first predetermined anode<br><br>
pressure may be measured by at least one of the pressure sensors 218, 220.<br>
The second valve 212 may be adapted to open or close at a second<br>
predetermined anode pressure measured by at least one of the pressure sensors<br>
218, 220. Other suitable pressure sensors adapted to measure the anode<br>
pressure may be used as desired. A skilled artisan should also appreciate that<br>
the first and second predetermined anode pressures may be selected as desired.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the first and second predetermined anode pressures<br>
may be selected to indicate when at least one of the anode supply manifold 76,<br>
the anode exhaust manifold 78, and the anodes are substantially filled with<br>
hydrogen from the anode supply stream 208.<br>
[0027] The fuel cell system 200 also may include a controller 221. The<br>
controller 221 is adapted to actuate the first valve 210 and the second valve 212,<br>
thereby opening or closing the first valve 210 and the second valve 212 as<br>
desired. For example, the controller 221 may receive a signal from the at least<br>
one pressure sensor 218, 220 indicating that the anode supply manifold 76 has a<br>
sufficient quantity of hydrogen present to begin filling the anodes. It should<br>
therefore be understood that the pressure of the anodes may be used to<br>
determine a composition of the gas in the anode supply manifold 76. The<br>
composition of the gas in the anode supply manifold 76 may be determined, for<br>
example, by calculation from the flow rate of the anode supply stream 208 and<br>
the pressure drop across at least one of the first and second valves 210, 212.<br>
The controller 221 may be adapted to actuate the first and second valves 210,<br>
212 in response to a pressure-determinant composition of gas or gases in the<br>
anode supply manifold 76.<br>
[0028] The fuel cell system 200 of the present disclosure may further<br>
have at least one resistive device 222 in electrical communication with the fuel<br>
cell stack 2. The resistive device 222 is adapted to provide a resistive load to the<br>
fuel cell stack 2, and short the fuel cell stack 2 as desired. In particular<br>
embodiments, the resistive device 222 is a high-voltage buss coupled to an<br>
electrical sink. The resistive device 222 may have a minimal electrical resistance<br>
and form a dead-short circuit that connects the end plates 14, 16 of the fuel cell<br><br>
stack 2. In other embodiments, the resistive device 222 is a resistor in electrical<br>
communication with the fuel cell stack 2. The resistive device 222 may be<br>
adjustable to provide a desired resistive load on the fuel cell stack 2. In an<br>
illustrative embodiment, the resistive device 222 is adapted to place a resistive<br>
load on the fuel cell stack 2 during startup, thereby limiting cell potential and<br>
militating against fuel cell degradation induced by carbon corrosion. A skilled<br>
artisan should understand that other suitable resistive devices 222 may be used<br>
as desired.<br>
[0029] In a further embodiment, the fuel cell system 200 includes a<br>
compressor (not shown) in communication with the cathode inlet manifold 78.<br>
The compressor is adapted to supply a cathode supply stream, such as air, to<br>
the cathode inlet manifold 72. The cathode inlet manifold 72 is in fluid<br>
communication with the cathodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the fuel cell system 200 includes a bypass valve and a bypass<br>
conduit in fluid communication with the compressor. The bypass valve and<br>
conduit are adapted, for example, to allow the cathode supply stream to bypass<br>
the fuel cell stack 2 as desired. For example, it should be appreciated that the<br>
bypass conduit may be in fluid communication with the first valve 210 and the<br>
second valve 212 for dilution of hydrogen exhausted via the valves 210, 212.<br>
[0030] As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the present disclosure includes a<br>
method for starting the fuel cell system 200. The method includes steps of<br>
providing the first valve 210 in at least one of an open position and a closed<br>
position, and the second valve 212 in a closed position. The first valve 210 is<br>
opened, if not provided in the open position, prior to a step of supplying the<br>
anode supply stream 208 to the anode supply manifold 76. The anode supply<br>
stream 208 may be a compressed hydrogen gas, for example. A flow rate of the<br>
anode supply stream 208 may be at least one of controlled and measured while<br>
the anode supply stream 208 is supplied.<br>
[0031] It should be appreciated that the step of opening the first valve<br>
210 may be preceded by a pressure build step in which the first valve 210<br>
remains closed for a desired period of time. In the pressure build step, pressure<br><br>
is increased within the anode supply manifold 76 to a level sufficient to force a<br>
first quantity of accumulated air 214 into the compressible volume of the anodes<br>
without forcing a substantial quantity of the anode supply stream 208 into the<br>
anodes. When a desired pressure is achieved, the first valve 210 may then be<br>
opened.<br>
[0032] Upon opening the first valve 210, the first quantity of air 214<br>
accumulated during the shut-down of the fuel cell system 200 is exhausted<br>
through the first valve by a pressure of the anode supply stream 208. If the<br>
volume of the plurality of fuel cells 202 is pressurized in the pressure build step,<br>
the anode supply stream 208 is caused to flow out of the first valve 210, thereby<br>
completely filling the anode supply manifold 76. The step of exhausting the first<br>
quantity of air 214 is known as a "purge step" or "header purge step."<br>
[0033] The first valve 210 is closed when the anode supply manifold 76<br>
is substantially filled with the anode supply stream 208. For example, the first<br>
valve 210 may be closed in response to a signal from the controller 221, to which<br>
the anode pressure measurements are provided. The first and second valves<br>
210, 212 may be opened or closed in when the anode pressure reaches a<br>
predetermined pressure value, for example. In one embodiment, the first valve<br>
210 is operated at a first predetermined pressure value. The second valve 212<br>
may be operated at a second predetermined pressure value. The first and<br>
second predetermined pressure values may be substantially the same. Thus,<br>
the first and second valves 210, 212 may be operated substantially<br>
simultaneously in response to the predetermined pressure value. It should be<br>
appreciated that pressure measurements may be employed as desired to<br>
operate the first and second valves 210, 212, thereby selectively supplying<br>
gaseous reactants to the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
[0034] During the purge step, while the first quantity of air 214 is being<br>
exhausted from the anode supply manifold 76, a pressure of the anodes of the<br>
plurality of fuel cells 202 is monitored. As described herein, the pressure of the<br>
anodes may be monitored with a pressure sensor. Individual anodes may be<br>
monitored with pressure sensors disposed in the fuel cell system 200, for<br><br>
example. In one embodiment, the pressure of the anodes is monitored by at<br>
least one of the first pressure sensor 218 and the second pressure sensor 220.<br>
The pressures of the anode supply manifold 76, the anode exhaust manifold 78,<br>
and anodes may also be monitored by other suitable pressure sensors, as<br>
desired.<br>
[0035] In a particular embodiment, the anode pressure is monitored by<br>
measuring a pressure of the anode supply manifold 76. The anode supply<br>
manifold 76 pressure may be monitored with a AP sensor, for example. When at<br>
least one of the first pressure sensor 218 and the second pressure sensor 220 is<br>
a AP sensor, the step of monitoring the anode pressure includes the step of<br>
measuring a pressure differential across at least one of the first and second<br>
valves 210, 212. In a particularly illustrative embodiment, the anode pressure is<br>
monitored by measuring a pressure differential across the first valve 210.<br>
[0036] At closure of the first valve 210, the second valve 212 is opened<br>
and a second quantity of air 216 is caused to flow from the anodes and the<br>
anode exhaust manifold 78 through the second valve 212. The flow of the<br>
second quantity of air 216 from the anodes is commonly referred to as a "stack<br>
flush step" or "flush step." The steps of closing the first valve 210 and opening<br>
the second valve 212 may be performed substantially simultaneously.<br>
[0037] It should be appreciated that the anode supply stream 208 of<br>
the present method is supplied substantially uniformly to the plurality of fuel cells<br>
202 during the flush step. The purging of the anode supply manifold 76 with the<br>
anode supply stream 208 prior to the stack flush facilitates the substantially<br>
uniform supply and distribution of the anode supply stream 208 to the anodes.<br>
The purge step fills the anode supply manifold 76. The substantially uniform<br>
supply and distribution then begins, for example, when the first valve 210 is<br>
closed and the second valve 212 is opened.<br>
[0038] The steps of closing and opening the first and second valves<br>
210, 212, respectively, may be performed when the anode pressure reaches the<br>
predetermined pressure value. The predetermined pressure value employed to<br>
control the valves 210, 212 may be selected as desired. The anode pressure<br><br><br>
may be calculated from the pressure differential measured across at least one of<br>
the first and second valves 210, 212, and the flow rate of the anode supply<br>
stream 208. A change in the anode pressure during the stack purge and flush<br>
steps may be indicative of a volume, such as one of the anode supply and<br>
exhaust manifolds 76, 78, having been substantially filled with hydrogen gas.<br>
Thus, the predetermined pressure value may be selected so that the steps of<br>
closing and opening the first and second valves 210, 212 occurs when hydrogen<br>
has substantially filled at least one of the anode supply manifold 76, the anode<br>
exhaust manifold 78, and the anodes themselves.<br>
[0039] As shown in FIG, 4, the predetermined pressure value may be<br>
selected as indicative of the anode supply stream 208 having substantially filled<br>
the anode supply manifold 76. For example, a first decrease 400 in a monitored<br>
anode pressure 402 during the purge step has been observed to be indicative of<br>
the anode supply stream 208 flowing through the first valve 210 instead of<br>
accumulated air 214. Similarly, in the fuel cell system 200 where the anode has<br>
some residual hydrogen remaining therein after shut-down, a similar decrease<br>
404 in a monitored anode pressure 406 is observed to occur earlier than when<br>
no residual hydrogen is present. Accordingly, a skilled artisan should appreciate<br>
that the monitored anode pressure may be indicative of the composition of the<br>
gases within the anode supply manifold 76 of the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
[0040] As a nonlimiting example, the anode supply manifold 76 may be<br>
filled with air following a shut-down period. A 30 kPa pressure drop may be<br>
initially observed across the first valve 210 at an anode supply stream 208 flow<br>
rate of about 10 L/s When the anode supply manifold 76 is substantially filled<br>
with hydrogen from the anode supply stream 208, however, the pressure drop<br>
decreases to about 5 to about 6 kPa, for example. The pressure drop across the<br>
first valve 210 is thereby indicative of the composition of the gas in the anode<br>
supply manifold 76. It should be understood that these figures are for the<br>
purpose of example only, and that other pressure drop values and flow rates may<br>
be observed, depending on the fuel cell system 200 and methods employed.<br><br>
[0041] As further depicted in FIG. 4, as the anode supply stream 208<br>
moves across the anodes, and the hydrogen in the anode supply stream reacts<br>
with oxygen from residual air on the cathodes, the dynamic pressure on the<br>
anodes therefore remains substantially constant. When all of the residual<br>
oxygen on the cathodes has been consumed, an increase 408 in the monitored<br>
anode pressure 402 may occur. The increase 408 is indicative of hydrogen from<br>
the anode supply stream 208 displacing the accumulated air 216 on the anodes.<br>
After reaching a local maximum, a second decrease 410 in the monitored anode<br>
pressure 402 may be observed. The second decrease 410 is indicative of the<br>
anodes having been substantially filled with hydrogen. A skilled artisan should<br>
therefore appreciate that the monitoring of the anode pressure may be employed<br>
to determine when to begin supplying the cathode supply stream to the cathode<br>
inlet manifold of the fuel cell system 200. In one embodiment, the anode<br>
pressure may be monitored at the second valve 212, for example with a pressure<br>
sensor such as a AP sensor.<br>
[0042] The method of the present disclosure may further include the<br>
step of activating a dead-short circuit of the fuel cell stack 2, for example, when<br>
the first valve 210 is closed and the second valve 212 is opened. The activation<br>
of the dead-short circuit is adapted to maintain an average voltage of the fuel cell<br>
stack 2 at substantially zero volts. The dead-short circuit is effective in<br>
minimizing an occurrence of undesirable localized voltages and therefore carbon<br>
corrosion, when the anodes are flushed with the anode supply stream 208.<br>
[0043] In one embodiment, the method of the disclosure includes the<br>
step of deactivating the dead-short of the fuel cell stack 2, for example, after the<br>
anodes are substantially filled with the anode supply stream 208. Following the<br>
deactivation of the dead-short, the method may then include the step of<br>
supplying the cathode supply stream to the cathode inlet manifold. It should be<br>
appreciated that the dead-short is not engaged when the cathode supply stream<br>
is supplied to the fuel cell stack 2 in order to militate against degradation of the<br>
fuel cell stack 2. However, the fuel cell stack 2 may be subject to a minimal<br>
parasitic load as the cathodes of the fuel cell stack 2 fill with air. The minimal<br><br>
parasitic load may be selected as desired and is adapted to minimize the voltage<br>
of the fuel cell stack 2 as the fuel cell system 200 air compressor is started. The<br>
employment of a minimal parasitic load may militate against undesirable open-<br>
circuit voltage events during the start-up operation of the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
[0044] As the cathode supply stream fills the cathodes, about one or<br>
two cathode volumes typically pass through the fuel cell stack 2 before the fuel<br>
cell system 200 is fully operational and prepared to receive a full electrical load.<br>
A fitness of the fuel cell stack 2 to receive the full load may be determined, for<br>
example, by measuring an average fuel cell voltage. In another embodiment, the<br>
fitness of the fuel cell stack 2 to receive the full load may be determined by<br>
measuring a minimum cell voltage, for example.<br>
[0045] It is surprisingly found with the fuel cell system 200 and method<br>
of the disclosure that undesirable exhausting of hydrogen during the start-up<br>
operation of the fuel cell stack 2 is minimized. In particular, the measurement of<br>
the anode pressure and employment of the anode pressure in controlling<br>
actuation of the first and second valves 210, 212 is now shown to be effective in<br>
limiting exhaust of hydrogen from the anode supply stream 208. Additionally, the<br>
measurement of the anode pressure surprisingly enables the employment of the<br>
dead-short circuit of the fuel cell stack 2 during the start-up by reliably providing<br>
each fuel cell 202 with the anode supply stream 208 for the duration of the dead-<br>
short. A degradation of the fuel cell stack 2 via carbon corrosion or, for example,<br>
due to a formation of localized conditions within the fuel cell stack 2 during the<br>
dead-short, are thereby militated against with the system and method of the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0046] While certain representative embodiments and details have<br>
been shown for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the<br>
