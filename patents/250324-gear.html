BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a gear in which chamfered portions shaped by forging are formed on the respective ridge line portions at inter sect ions between tooth bottom lands, tooth flanks, and a tooth tip land of the gear and end faces in the axial direction of the gear.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In the conventional gears (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-026214), burrs caused by hobbing are removed by applying machining such as cutting to portions corresponding to the tooth flanks and other end faces in the axial direction of a hobbed gear material.<br>
In the conventional gears, to portions corresponding to the tooth flanks and other end faces in the axial direction of a hobbed gear material, machining such as cutting is applied for removing burrs caused by hobbing, and fiber flows are cut at the cutting end faces, and this lowers the strength.<br>
Also in the conventional gears, an exclusive machining<br><br>
process is necessary only for chamfering a hobbed gear material by machining, so that this hinders the productivity.<br>
Furthermore, in the conventional gears, to prevent dents caused during forging of a gear from harmfully influencing engagement, burnishing is added depending on the circumstances, however, the shaped tooth flanks are engaged with each other and this lowers the quality of the gears.<br>

direction of the gear are respectively formed by round chamfering at curvatures in the ranges of R1.0 through 2.5, RO. 5 through 2.0, and RO.3 through 1.0.<br>
Fig. 6A is an enlarged perspective view of the section surrounded by the circle B of Fig. 4 in the gear according to the second embodiment of the present invention, partially cut away along the A-A line of Fig. 3B. And sectional views along the H-H line close to the tooth bottom land, along the G-G line at the center of the tooth flank, and along the F-F line close to the tooth tip land in Fig. 6A are respectively shown in Fig. 6B, Fig. 6C, and Fig. 6D.<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view of a die 2 constituting a manufacturing apparatus for shaping the gear according to the second embodiment of the present invention by forging.<br>
The die 2 includes, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, a lower die 210 and an upper die 220, and the lower die 210 includes an outer circumferential portion 2110 and an inner circumferential portion 2120, and the upper die 220 includes an outer circumferential portion 2210, an inner circumferential lower portion 2220, and an inner circumferential upper portion 2230.<br>

Next, processes of shaping the gear and the tooth flanks<br><br>
in the manufacturing method for manufacturing the gear according to the second embodiment of-the present invention will be -explained.<br>
The material is upset-shaped in the process of hot forging as shown in Fig. 12, and then rough-forged and then finish-forged.<br>
In the rough forging and finish forging in the hot forging process, as shown in Fig. 12, chamfered portions are formed in the die so that the chamfered portions of the die are transferred onto a work by forging. The rough forging and finish forging can be applied in one process as appropriate, or rough forging or finish forging can be omitted.<br>
The finish-forged work is subjected to trimming and piercing, and after the end faces thereof are machined as shown in Fig. 13, in a cold forging process, cold coining is performed, and according to volume calculation, the chamfered portions are simultaneously filled when the coining is completed.<br>
Furthermore, in a cold sizing process, the gear as a work is inserted into a die by switching the upper side and the lower side of the gear, and subjected to round chamfering, and excessive volume is moved to the end face sides as excess thicknesses because chamfering preliminary shaping is not applied as a preprocess.<br><br>
In the gear according to the second embodiment of the present invention with the above-described configuration, -the respective chamfered portions 111, 121, and 131 formed on the respective ridge line portions at intersections between the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear are formed by round chamfering at curvatures different from each other, so that fiber flows of the respective chamfered portions become narrow in intervals in a state that they are parallel to each other, and the texture thereof becomes dense, whereby an effect is obtained that resistance against stress concentration is increased.<br>
In addition, in the gear according to the second embodiment of the present invention, joint portions 1231 between the chamfered portions 121 and 131 adjacent to each other formed on the respective ridge line portions at the intersections between the tooth flanks 12 and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear and the end faces in the axial direction of the gear are formed at a curvature that is gradually changed, whereby an effect is obtained that stress concentration on the joint portions of the adjacent chamfered portions is avoided.<br>
Furthermore, in the gear, manufacturing method and apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention, the gear is formed by forging a material shaped so as to increase the tooth .width of the gear toward the tooth tip, and inserted into a die that has chamfered portions for forge-shaping the chamfered portions on the respective ridge line portions at the intersections between the tooth bottom lands, the tooth flanks, and the tooth tip land of the gear and the end faces in the axial direction of the gear, whereby an effect is obtained that the density is made even across the entirety of each tooth to uniform strength.<br>
In addition, in the gear, manufacturing method and apparatus for the gear according to the second embodiment, round forged chamfered portions are formed at the respective ridge line portions at the intersections between the tooth bottom lands, the tooth flanks, and the tooth tip land of the gear to be shaped by forging and the end faces in the axial direction of the gear, so that the strength of the entire gear is increased, fiber flows become narrow in intervals at the respective chamfered portions in a state that they are parallel to each other, and this makes the texture dense and increases resistance against stress concentration, and machining such as cutting to remove burrs caused by hobbing in the conventional techniques is not necessary, and therefore, an effect is obtained that lowering in strength is prevented and the machining cost is<br><br>
reduced.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
A gear according to a third embodiment of the present invention is different from the above-described second embodiment in that, mainly, as shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, the chamfered portions 112 shaped by forging between the tooth bottom lands 11 and the tooth flanks 12 of the gear 1 are added, and the following explanation is given mainly about the difference.<br>
In the gear according to the third embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, on ridge line portions at intersections between the chamfered portions 112 shaped by forging between the tooth bottom lands 11 and the tooth flanks 12 of the gear 1 and end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear, chamfered portions 1121 with curvatures different from each other shaped by forging are formed.<br>
Namely, in the gear according to the third embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 14, joint portions 1121 and 1231 between chamfered portions adjacent to each other formed on the respective ridge line portions at the intersections between the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear 1 and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear are formed at curvatures that<br><br>
are gradually changed.<br>
In a die 2 as a manufacturing apparatus for manufacturing the gear according to the third embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig, 15, chamfered portions 2221 and chamfered portions 2231 are formed between chamfered portions 211, chamfered portions 221, and a chamfered portion 231 respectively corresponding to the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear 1.<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 16, a material shaped in advance so as to increase the tooth width (W in the drawings) of the gear toward the tooth tip inserts dies respectively including chamfered portions for forge-shaping chamfered portions on the respective ridge line portions at the intersections between the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear, and then the material is shaped by forging.<br>
In the gear according to the third embodiment of the present invention with the above-described configuration, the chamfered portions 112 shaped by forging are formed on straight ridge line portions between the tooth bottom lands 11 and the tooth flanks 12 of the gear, so that an effect is obtained that stress concentration between the tooth bottom lands 11 and the<br><br>
tooth flanks,12 of the gear is avoided.<br>
In addition, in the gear according to the third embodiment of the present invention, joint portions 1121 between chamfered portions 111 and 121, and joint portions 1231 between chamfered portions 121 and 131, adjacent to each other formed on the ridge line portions at the intersections respectively of the tooth bottom lands 11 and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear and the tooth flanks 12 and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear, and of the tooth flanks 12 and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear, are formed at curvatures that are gradually changed, so that an effect is obtained that stress concentration on the joint portions between the chamfered portions adjacent to each other is avoided.<br>
Furthermore, in the gear, manufacturing apparatus and manufacturing method for the gear according to the third embodiment of the present invention, on the respective ridge line portions at intersections between the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear to be shaped by forging and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear, round chamfered portions are formed by forging, so that the strength of the entire gear is increased, fiber<br><br>
flows at the respective chamfered portions become narrow in intervals in a state that the fiber flows are parallel to each other, and this makes the texture dense and increases resistance against stress concentration, and furthermore, machining such as cutting to remove burrs caused by hobbing in the conventional techniques is not necessary, so that an effect is obtained that lowering in strength is prevented and the machining cost is reduced.<br>
Namely, in the third embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 16, a material shaped in advance so as to increase the tooth width (W in the drawings) of the gear inserts dies respectively including chamfered portions for forge-shaping chamfered portions on the respective ridge line portions at the intersections between the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear, and then shaped by forging.<br>
This aims at complete filling of the material into the die by forging, and this case is characterized in that the shape of the material before being forged is devised so that the thickness flow goes to the tooth tip of the gear. By shaping so that the tooth width (W in the drawings) of the gear increases toward the tooth tip as shown in Fig. 16, the volume (bulk)<br><br>
can be made the same, so that forging of a round shape is realized.<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention, chamfering on the respective chamfered portions 111, 121, and 131 are tangent round chamfering by forging as shown in Fig. 17C. Therefore, different from the machine chamfering shown in Fig. 17A, the fiber flows are not cut, and the texture at the chamfered portion becomes dense, and in comparison with the straight chamfering shown in Fig. 17B, no corner where the texture becomes dense is formed, so that stress concentration is unlikely to occur.<br>
Namely, in the case of machine chamfering involving hobbing, cutting, and other machining after forging, fiber flows are cut as shown in Fig. 17A. Furthermore, in the case of the straight chamfering by forging as shown in Fig. 17B, although the fiber flows are not cut, the chamfered portion includes a corner where the texture becomes partially dense, so that the density of the texture or the interval gap between adjacent fiber flows fluctuates depending on the locations of the corner and occurrence of stress concentration is inevitable.<br>
The manufacturing apparatus and method according to the third embodiment of the present invention provides a high-strength engaging gear in which stress concentration is minimized, and the conventional machining after forging for<br><br>
chamfering is omitted, so that a manufacturing process of high productivity is,, provided,, and furthermore, burnishing is omitted, so that a high-quality gear can be provided.<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention, at a portion (involute) of the gear where accuracy is necessary, the round is made small to secure a high-accuracy range, and at a portion (fillet) where strength is necessary, the round is made larger to secure the strength. At a portion that should not be engaged (forged surface side of the tooth tip), the round is made larger to make this portion escape so as not to be engaged.<br>
The tooth profile shaping by forging and round chamfering on the ridge lines at the intersections between the respective portions around the tooth flanks are simultaneously performed, so that the target shape can be shaped by forging with a die in which the coupling of the tooth flank with the end face of the product is not straight but is rounded at a predetermined constant curvature or a curvature which is gradually changed. In the third embodiment, in the hot forging and cold forging, the product to be inserted into the die is turned upside down and shaped in two processes.<br>
The important point is that, for even full filling in the cold forging mainly for chamfering and shaping the chamfered portions, the respective tooth profile sections in the hot<br><br>
forging are partially underfilled. Namely, the tooth width is set so as to increase toward the tooth tip.<br>
The straight chamfering (Fig. 17B) in the conventional techniques has disadvantages that the gear strength cannot be secured, and if anything, the accuracy of the engaging surfaces is lowered due to forging chamfering. However, in the third embodiment of the present invention, stress concentration on the weakest sections is remarkably relaxed, and a gear with strength higher than that in the conventional techniques can be formed.<br>
In the third embodiment of the present invention, the chamfered portions are simultaneously formed when the tooth profile is formed, so that the chamfering process in the conventional techniques can be omitted, high productivity is obtained, and since all peripheries of the tooth flanks are rounded like R-shape or round shape, dents (dents and other flaws) occurring during manufacturing processes can be prevented from harmfully influencing the engagement performance.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
A gear according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention is mainly different in that the present invention is applied to a spur gear as shown in Fig. 18, and the following<br><br>
explanation is mainly given about the difference.<br>
In the gear according to the fourth embodiment of the-present invention, as shown in Fig. 18, chamfered portions 112 and 123 are formed between the tooth bottom lands 11 and the tooth flanks 12 and between the tooth flanks 12 and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear 1, and chamfered portions 111, 121, and 131 adjacent to each other of the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear 1 are respectively formed by round chamfering at a predetermined constant curvature (0.5 through 2.0).<br>
Namely, in the gear according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, joint portions 1121 and 1231 between the chamfered portions 111, 121, and 131 adjacent to each other formed on the respective ridge line portions at the intersections with the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear are formed at a predetermined constant curvature.<br>
The gear according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention brings about the same working effect as in the first embodiment described above.<br>
Fifth Embodiment<br>
A gear according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention is mainly different from the fourth embodiment described above in that the respective chamfered portions 111,<br><br>
121, and 131 formed on the respective ridge line portions at the intersections between the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, and the tooth tip land 13 of the gear 1 and the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear 1 are formed by round chamfering at curvatures that are gradually changed as shown in Fig. 19.<br>
The gear according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention brings about the same working effect as in the second embodiment and the third embodiment described above.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention, as herein disclosed are taken as some embodiments for explaining the present invention. It is to be understood that the present invention should not be restricted by these embodiments and any modifications and additions are possible so far as they are not beyond the technical idea or principle based on descriptions of the scope of the patent claims.<br>
In the second embodiment described above, an example is explained in which round chamfered portions 111, 121, and 131 are formed on the respective ridge line portions of the end faces 14 in the axial direction of the gear in the hot forging process and the cold forging process, however, the invention is not limited to this, and for example, it is also allowed that round chamfering is performed only in the cold forging<br><br>
process, or one end in the axial direction of the gear is round chamfered in a plurality of cold forging processes, and then the other end in the axial direction of the gear is round chamfered. Furthermore, it is also possible that one end in the axial direction of the gear is round chamfered in a plurality of cold forging processes to respectively form the chamfered portions 111, 121, and 131 of the tooth bottom lands 11, the tooth flanks 12, the tooth tip land 13 in order.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The gear has forged chamfered portions on the respective ridge line portions at intersections between tooth bottom lands, tooth flanks, and a tooth tip land of the gear and end faces in the axial direction of the gear, and the gear does not need machining such as cutting to remove burrs caused by hobbing in the conventional techniques, so that the gear can be applied to an application that prevents lowering in strength and reduces the machining cost.<br><br><br></td>
