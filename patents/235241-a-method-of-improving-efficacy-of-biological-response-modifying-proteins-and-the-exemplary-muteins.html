				<td>A METHOD OF IMPROVING EFFICACY OF BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE-MODIFYING PROTEINS AND THE EXEMPLARY MUTEINS<br>
Technical Field The present invention relates to a protein variant which substitutes valine for phenylalanine residue in a binding domain having a biological response-modifying function by binding to a receptor, ligand or substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to a protein variant which substitutes valine for phenylalanine residue in an a-helix domain participating in the binding of a human cytokine protein to a corresponding receptor.<br>
Background Art Many human diseases are caused by the loss of protein function due to defects or an insufficient amount of a protein. To treat such diseases, related proteins have been directly administered to patients. However, many physiologically active proteins used as medicines are easily degraded in serum before they arrive at target tissues and act therein. For this reason, most physiologically active proteins having therapeutic value are excessively or frequently administered to patients to maintain an appropriate concentration capable of offering satisfactory therapeutic effects.<br>
An approach to solve the above problems is to conjugate with polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) or microencapsulate physiologically active proteins. However, these methods are cumbersome because target proteins are primarily produced in microorganisms and purified, and are then PEGlyated or microencapsulated. In addition, cross-linking may occur at undesired positions, which may negatively affect the homogeneity of final products.<br>
Another approach involves glycosylation. Cell surface proteins and secretory proteins produced by eukaryotic cells are modified by a glycosylation process. Glycosylation is known to influence in vivo stability and function of proteins, as well as their physiological properties. However, since glycosylated proteins can be produced only by eukaryotic cells capable of performing glycosylation, their production process is complicated, and it is difficult to attain homogeneous final products which are glycosylated at all desired positions.<br><br>
in addition, the conventional techniques all improve the problems associated with administration frequency, but do not increase the physiological efficacy of proteins, leading to excessive dosage. For example, NESP developed by the Amgen Company (see U. S. Pat. No.<br>
6,586, 398) improves the frequent administration by extending the half-lives of proteins in the blood, but does not increase the efficacy of proteins, leading to excessive dosage that may induce the production of blocking antibodies.<br>
An approach used to improve the efficacy of physiologically active proteins is to mutagenize some amino acid residues of a wild-type protein to improve biological activity of the protein. Related protein variants are disclosed in the following patent publications: (1) U. S. Pat No.<br>
5,457, 089: human erythropoietin (EPO) variants where the carboxyl terminal region was altered to increase binding affinity of EPO to its receptor, (2) International Pat. Publication No. 02/077034: human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) variants where a T-cell epitope was altered to reduce immunogenicity of human G-CSF in humans; (3) International Pat. Publication No. 99/57147: human thrombopoietin (TPO) variants prepared by substuting glutaminic acid at the 115 position with lysine, arginin or tyrosine in a TOP protein having an amino acid sequence corresponding to 7th to 151st amino acid residues of human mature TPO; and (4) U. S. Pat Nos. 6,136, 563 and 6,022, 711 that disclose human growth hormone variants having alanine substitutions at the 18,22, 25,26, 29,65, 168 and 174 positions.<br>
However, the aforementioned protein variants are altered forms made for improving only therapeutic efficacy regardless of changes in in vivo antigenicity. Thus, the scale, degree and position of these alterations have high potential to induce immune responses in humans. Antigenicity in humans may cause serious adverse effects (Casadevall et al. N. Eng. J. Med. 2002, vol. 346, p. 469).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide biological response-modifying protein variants having improved pharmacological action, which are capable of maximizing biological response modifying effects upon administration and preventing the formation of blocking antibodies through an improvement in efficacy of conventional biological response-modifying proteins, and methods of preparing such variants.<br><br>

The amino acid position is numbered from the N terminus of a mature wild-type protein.<br><br>
The term"protein variant", as used herein, refers to a protein that has an amino acid sequence different from a wild-type form by a substitution of valine for phenylalanine residue in a protein having physiological function by binding to a receptor, ligand or substrate, in particular, in a domain participating in the binding to a receptor, ligand or substrate. In the present invention, a protein variant is designated for convenience as"protein name-[(one capital for an amino acid) (amino acid position) (one capital for another amino acid)]". For example, TPO-[F131V] indicates a TPO variant in which the phenylalanine residue at position 131 of wild-type TPO is substituted by valine.<br>

To improve the efficacy of modulating biological responses for the aforementioned numerous proteins having biological response-modulating function, the present invention intends to provide protein variants capable of binding to receptors, ligands or substrates having a higher hydrophobic force than that of wild types. For this purpose, the present invention is characterized by substituting valine for phenylalanine residue in a binding domain of each of the proteins.<br>
Phenylalanine is a relatively non-polar amino acid that has an aromatic side chain and a known hydrophobicity index of 3.0. Valine is a non-polar hydrophobic amino acid that has an aliphatic side chain and a known hydrophobicity index of 4.0. In addition, since valine is smaller than phenylalanine, a protein substituting valine for phenylalanine residue becomes more deeply depressed in a pocket binding to a corresponding receptor, ligand or substrate. Thus, a protein substituting valine for phenylalanine residue in a binding domain has increased hydrophobic force and a more deeply depressed space so that it has increased binding affinity to a receptor, ligand or substrate, leading to a desired increase in biological response-modulating efficiency.<br>
In addition, the valine substitution for phenylalanine residue, as a conservative substitution, has a minimal influence on the secondary or tertiary structure of a protein, and thus rarely affects the function of the protein (Argos, EMBO J. 1989, vol. 8, pp779-85). Further, because phenylalanine is mainly present in a highly hydrophobic region, it is rarely exposed to the exterior. When such phenylalanine residue is substituted by valine, a protein becomes more deeply depressed from the surface due to the higher hydrophobicity of valine. Thus, this substitution has a lower potential to induce antibody production. A certain protein should primarily bind a corresponding receptor, ligand or substrate to modulate a specific biological response. In the case that the stronger this binding is, the efficacy of modulating a biological response is improved, related<br><br>
proteins all may be altered according to the present invention, and the present invention includes all of the resulting protein variants.<br>
The fact that such a substitution of valine for phenylalanine residue leads to increased binding affinity is supported by the finding of a mutation of FcyRIIIa (CD 16) expressed on NK cells in human autoimmune diseases. The human receptor protein has a genetic polymorphism. That is. individuals are divided into two groups: at position 176 in a region participating in recognizing Fc of an antibody ligand, one group has phenylalanine, and the other group has valine. Individuals having phenylalanine at position 176 of the receptor have weakened binding affinity to the Fc region of the antibody ligand and are highly susceptible to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Jianming Wu et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1997, vol. 100, pp. 1059-70).<br>
On the other hand, as noted above, the present invention is characterized by substituting valine for phenylalanine residue in a binding domain of a biological response-modulating protein.<br>
The ternV'binding domain", as used herein, refers to a portion (that is, domain) of a protein performing its biological function by binding to a receptor, ligand or substrate, and has relatively high hydrophobicity and low antigenicity compared to other regions of the protein. Binding domains of proteins are well known in the art For example, some 4-a helix bundle cytokines and interferons, which are used in an embodiment of the present invention, are known to have a D-a helix structure and an A-a helix structure, respectively, that serve as binding domains for corresponding receptors.<br>
However, a binding domain altered according to the present invention is not limited to binding domains known in the art. This is because the binding of a biological response-modulating protein to a receptor, ligand or substrate is influenced by, in addition to amino acid residues involved in direct binding, other several amino acid residues. A"binding domainMof a biological response- modulating protein, altered according to the present invention, further includes about 50 amino acid residues, preferably about 25 amino acid residues, and more preferably about 10 amino acid residues, from both ends of a binding domain known in the art.<br>
One aspect of the present invention involves cytokines that typically contain several a helix structures. Among them, the first and last helices from the N-termius are known as binding<br><br>
helices responsible for binding of cytokines to corresponding receptors differ according to the type of cytokines, and. are well known in the art For example, in IL-2, the second and fifth helices bind to the p55a receptor among IL-2 receptors, the first helix binds to the p75y receptor among IL-2 receptors, and the sixth helix binds to gamma receptor (Fernando Bazan, Science J. 1992, vol. 257, pp. 410-2). As described above, cytokines each have particular helices participating in binding, but the helices have highly conserved amino acid sequences. The present invention provides a cytokine variant that is capable of binding to a cytokine receptor with higher affinity than a wild-type cytokine by substituting valine for phenylalanine residue in an alpha helix corresponding to a binding domain of a cytokine.<br>
One aspect related to the cytokines involves the 4-helix bundle family of cytokines. Such cytokines include CNTF, EPO, Flt3L, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-3, L-4, IL-5, L-6, IL-12p35, LPT, LIF, M-CSF, OSM, PL, SCF, TPO G-CSF, GHR and IFN. These cytokines all have four alpha helices, which are designated as A-alpha helix, B-alpha helix, C-alpha helix and D-alpha helix, respectively.<br>
The D-and A-alpha helices mainly participate in binding to receptors (Fernando Bazar, Immunology today, 1990, vol. 11 pp. 350-4, The Cytokine Facts Book, 1994, pp. 104-247).<br>
Among the aforementioned 4-helix bundle cytokines. CNTF, EPO, Flt3L, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, L-12p35, LPT, LIF, M-CSF, OSM, PL, SCF, TPO, G-CSF and GHR have binding domains which each include a D-alpha helix and a region linking a C-alpha helix and the D- alpha helix. More particularly, the binding domains include amino acid residues between positions 110 and 180 among amino acid residues of the 4-helix bundle cytokines. Therefore, in an aspect, the present invention provides a 4-helix bundle cytokine variant that is capable of binding to a corresponding receptor with higher affinity than a wild type by substituting valine for phenylalanine among amino acid residues between positions 110 and 180 of a 4-helix bundle cytokine.<br>
Of the aforementioned 4-helix bundle cytokines, interferons (e. g., IFN-o2A, IFN-o2B, IFN-B, IFN-y, IFNe, IFN-T) have a binding domain that contains an"A-alpha helix". More particularly,<br><br>
the binding domain of interferons includes amino acid residues between positions 1 and 50. Therefore, in another aspect the present invention provides an interferon variant that is capable of binding to an interferon receptor having higher affinity than a wild type by substituting valine for phenylalanine among amino acid residues between positions 1 and 50 of an interferon.<br>
On the other hand, the binding domain altered according to the present invention may include two or more phenylalanine residues. The two or more phenylalanine residues may all be substituted by valine. However, because this case leads to a great reduction in protein expression levels, preferably only one phenylalanine residue is substituted by valine. In this regard, the present inventors found that, when phenylalanine residue present in a highly hydrophobic region is substituted by valine, the biological response-modulating protein has much improved efficacy. Therefore, in the present invention, the phenylalanine residue to be substituted by valine is preferably selected in a highly hydrophobic region present in the binding domain specified according to the present invention.<br>
Hydrophobicity for a specific region of an amino acid sequence comprising a protein may be determined by a method known in the art (Kyte, J. et al. J. Mol. Biol. 1982, vol. 157, pp. 105-132, Hopp, T. P. et al. Proc. Nat Acad. Sci. USA, 1981, vol. 78 (6), pp. 3824-3828).<br>
The variant of a biological response-modulating protein according to the present invention may be prepared by chemical synthetic methods generally known in the art (Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W. H. Freeman and Co. , NY 1983). Representative methods, but are not limited to, include liquid or solid phase synthesis, fragment condensation, and F-MOC or T-BOC chemical synthesis (Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins, Williams et al., Eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton Florida, 1997; A Practical Approach, Atherton &amp; Sheppard, Eds., IRL Press, Oxford, England, 1989).<br>
Alternatively, the protein variant according to the present invention may be prepared by recombinant DNA techniques. These techniques include a process of preparing a DNA sequence encoding the protein variant according to the present invention. Such a DNA sequence may be prepared by altering a DNA sequence encoding a wild-type protein. In brief, after a DNA<br><br>
sequence encoding a wild-type protein is synthesized, a codon for phenylalanine is changed to another codon for valine by site-directed mutagenesis, thus generating a desired DNA sequence.<br>
Also, the preparation of a DNA sequence encoding the protein variant according to the present invention may be achieved by a chemical method. For example, a DNA sequence encoding the protein variant may be synthesized by a chemical method using an oligonucleotide synthesizer.<br>
An oligonucleotide is made based on an amino acid sequence of a desired protein variant, and preferably by selecting a appropriate codon used by a host cell producing a protein variant. The degeneracy in the genetic code, which means that one amino acid is specified by more than one codon, is well known in the art. Thus, there is a plurality of DNA sequences with degeneracy encoding a specific protein variant, and they all fall into the scope of the present invention.<br>
A DNA sequence encoding the protein variant according to the present invention may or may not include a DNA sequence encoding a signal sequence. The signal sequence, if present, should be recognized by a host cell selected for the expression of the protein variant The signal sequence may have a prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin or a combinational origin, and may be a signal sequence of a native protein. The employment of a signal sequence may be determined according to the effect of expression of a protein variant as a secretory form in a recombinant cell producing the protein variant. If a selected cell is a prokaryotic cell, a DNA sequence typically does not encode a signal sequence but instead contains preferably an N-tenninal methionine for direct expression of a desired protein, and most preferably, a signal sequence derived from a wild type protein is used.<br>
Such a DNA sequence as prepared above is operably linked to another DNA sequence encoding the protein variant of the present invention, and is inserted into a vector including one or more expression control sequences regulating the expression of the resulting DNA sequence. Then, a host is transformed or transfected with the resulting recombinant expression vector. The resulting transformant or transfectant is cultured in a suitable medium under suitable conditions for the expression of the DNA sequence. A substantially pure variant of a biological response-modulating protein coded by the DNA sequence is recovered from the resulting culture.<br><br>
The terrrTvector", as used herein, means a DNA molecule serving as a vehicle capable of stably carrying exogeneous genes into host cells. For useful application, a vector should be replicable, have a system for introducing itself into a host cell, and possess selectable markers. In addition, the ternV'recombinant expression vector", as used herein, refers to a circular DNA molecule carrying exogeneous genes operably linked thereto to be expressed in a host cell. When introduced into a host cell, the recombinant expression plasmid has the ability to replicate regardless of host chromosomal DNA at a high copy number and to produce heterogeneous DNA. As generally known in the art, in order to increase the expression level of a transfected gene in a host cell, the gene should be operably linked to transcription and translation regulatory sequences functional in a host cell selected as an expression system. Preferably, the expression regulation sequences and the exogeneous genes may be carried in a single expression vector containing bacteria-selectable markers and a replication origin. In the case that eukaryotic cells are used as an expression system, the expression vector should further comprise expression markers useful in the eukaryotic host cells.<br>
The tenrTexpression control sequences", as used herein in connection with a recombinant expression vector, refers to nucleotide sequences necessary or advantageous for expression of the protein variant according to the present invention. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the nucleotide sequence encoding the protein variant. Non-limiting examples of the expression control sequences include leader sequences, polyadenylation sequences, propeptide sequences, promoters, enhancers or upstream activating sequences, signal peptide sequences, and transcription terminators. The expression control sequence contains at least one promoter sequence.<br>
The ternToperably linked"refers to a state in which a nucleotide sequence is arranged with another nucleotide sequence in a functional relationship. The nucleotide sequences may be a gene and control sequences, which are linked in such a manner that gene expression is induced when a suitable molecule (for example, transcription-activating protein) binds to the control sequence (s). For example, when a pre-sequence or secretory leader facilitates secretion of a mature protein, it is referred to as "operably linked to the protein". A promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it regulates transcription of the coding sequence. A ribosome-binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence when it is present at a position allowing<br><br>
translation of the coding sequence. Typically, the term"operably linked"6ieans that linked nucleotide sequences are in contact with each other. In the case of a secretory leader sequence, the term means that it contacts a coding sequence and is present within a leading frame of the coding sequence. However, an enhancer need not necessarily contact a coding sequence. Linkage of the nucleotide sequences may be achieved by ligation at convenient restriction enzyme recognition sites. In the absence of restriction enzyme recognition sites, oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers may be used, which are synthesized by the conventional methods.<br>
In order to express a DNA sequence encoding the protein variant according to the present invention, a wide variety of combinations of host cells and vectors as an expression system may be used. Expression vectors useful for transforming eukaryotic host cells contain expression regulation sequences from, for example, SV40, bovine papillomavirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated viruses, cytomegalovirus and retroviruses. Expression vectors useful in bacterial host cells include bacterial plasmids from E. coli, which are exemplified by pET, pRSET, pBluescript, pGEX2T, pUC, pBR322, pMB9 and derivatives thereof, plasmids having a broad range of host cells, such as RP4, phage DNAs, exemplified by a wide variety of phage derivatives including X gtlO, X gtl 1 and NM989, and other DNA phages, exemplified by filamentous single-stranded DNA phages such as Ml3. Expression vectors useful in yeast cells include 2p plasmid and derivatives thereof.<br>
Expression vectors useful in insect cells include pVL 941.<br>
To express a DNA sequence encoding the protein variant according to the present invention, any of a wide variety of expression control sequences may be used by these vectors. Such useful expression control sequences include those associated with structural genes of the aforementioned expression vectors. Examples of useful expression control sequences include the early and later promoters of SV40 or adenoviruses, the lac system, the trp system, the TAC or TRC system, T3 and T7 promoters, the major operator and promoter regions of phage k, the control regions for fd coat protein, the promoter for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, the promoters of phosphatases, for example, Pho5, the promoters of the yeast alpha-mating system and other sequences known to control the expression of genes of<br><br>

Host cells transformed or transfected with the aforementioned recombinant expression vector comprise another aspect of the present invention. A wide range of mononuclear host cells may be used for expressing a DNA sequence encoding the protein variant of the present invention.<br>
Examples of the host cells include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells such as E. coli, Pseudomonas sp. , Bacillus sp. , Streptomyces sp. , fungi or yeasts, insect cells such as SpodopteraXugiperda (Sf9), animal cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or mouse cells, African green monkey cells such as COS 1, COS 7, BSC 1, BSC 40 or BMT 10, and tissue-cultured human and plant cells. Preferred hosts include bacteria such as E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, and tissue-cultured mammalian cells.<br>
The transformation and transaction may be performed by the methods described in basic experimental guidebooks (Davis et al., Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, 1986; Sambrook, J. , et al., Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, 1989). The preferred methods for introducing a DNA sequence encoding the protein variant according to the present invention into a host cell include, for example, calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, transvection, microinjection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, scrape loading, ballistic introduction, and infection.<br>
Also, it will be understood that all vectors and expression control sequences do not function equally in expressing the DNA sequence of the present invention. Likewise, all hosts do not function equally for an identical expression system. However, those skilled in the art are able to make a suitable selection from various vectors, expression control sequences and hosts, within the scope of the present invention, without a heavy experimental burden. For example, a vector may be selected taking, a host cell into consideration because the vector should be replicated in the host cell.<br>
The copy number of a vector, ability to control the copy number, and expression of other proteins encoded by the vector, for example, an antibiotic marker, should be deliberated. Also, an expression control sequence may be selected taking several factors into consideration. For<br><br>
example, relative strength, control capacity and compatibility with the	sequence of the<br>
present invention of the sequence, particularly with respect to possible secondary structures, should be deliberated. Further, the selection of a host cell may be made under consideration of compatibility with a selected vector, toxicity of a product encoded by a nucleotide sequence, secretory nature of the product, ability to correctly fold a polypeptide, fermentation or cultivation requirements, ability to ensure easy purification of a product encoded by a nucleotide sequence, or the like.<br>
In the method of preparing the protein variant according to the present invention, the host cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of a polypeptide using methods known in the art For example, the cells may be cultivated by shake Bask cultivation, small-scale or large-scale fermentation in laboratory or industrial fermenters performed in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the polypeptide to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium containing carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are commercially available from commercial suppliers and may be prepared according to published compositions (for example, the catalog of American Type Culture Collection). If the polypeptide is secreted into the nutrient medium, the polypeptide can be recovered directly from the medium. If the polypeptide is not secreted, it can be recovered from cell lysats.<br>
The biological response-modulating protein variant according to the present invention may be recovered by methods known in the art. For example, the protein variant may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray drying, evaporation, or precipitation. Further, the protein variant may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e. g. , ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobicity, and size exclusion), electrophoresis, differential solubility (e. g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction.<br>

Example 9. Pharmacokinetic Profiles of EPO-and TPO-wild types and muteins Difference of pharmacokinetic profiles of each EPO-and TPO-muteins between their wildtype was investigated. TPO or TPO muteins was injected intravenously into rabbits (NewZealand White, 3kg). And then blood samples were collected serially. EPO and TPO concentrations from each samples were detected by using quantitative ELISA assay as described above.<br>
Injection of EPOs into mice (12weeks, Balb/c, 30g) was performed by both intraperitonealy and intravenously.

Concentration of TPO-[F141Vl wae decreaeed more rapidly than that of wild type TPO. TPO- [F141V] was shifted from blood to peripheral target tissues more rapidly, due to its stronger binding affinity to receptor.<br>
After intravenous injection of 1000 I. U/kg of wild type EPO and EP0-[F148V1 into rabbit, plasma concentration profiles of wild type EPO and EPO- [F148V] in blood were shown in Figure 8b.<br><br>
