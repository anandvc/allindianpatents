The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
The invention relates to coated bodies made of metal  hard metal  cermet  or ceramic  coated with a single-layered or multi-layered layer system that contains at least one hard material composite layer  and method(s) for coating of such bodies.  The hard material layer according to the invention produced on the bodies is characterized by a composite structure having a smooth  homogeneous surface  great oxidation resistance  and great hardness  and can particularly be used as a wear protection layer on Si3N4 and WC/Co indexable inserts and steel components.<br><br>
STATE OF THE ART<br><br>
Tools for chip-removing machining must meet high requirements with regard to useful lifetime and abrasion resistance.  Coatings on the basis of nitrides  carbides  and carbonitrides of titanium have been used as wear protection layers for a long time.  In recent years  the trend was to provide these coatings with greater oxidation resistance by means of incorporating aluminum.<br><br>
TiAlN layers having a cubic NaCl structure and different methods for their production are known.  In this connection  mono-phase fcc-TiAlN layers or mixtures of fcc-TiAlN and hexagonal AlN are produced using PVD  plasma-CVD or thermal CVD methods (WO 03/085152 A2; K. Kawata  H. Sugimura  O. Takai  Thin Solid Films  390 (2001)  p. 64-69; DE 10 2005 032 860 B4).<br><br>
These layers are continuously improved further by means of the incorporation of carbon and of further metals  whereby both PVD and CVD methods are used.<br><br>
Layer systems having pure fcc-TiAlCN layers are explained  for example  in CN 101319302A.  In this connection  a method for PVD deposition of a linearly granulated TiAlCN layer is described  whereby the C/N gradient is produced by means of targeted metering of N2 and C2H2.<br><br>
The patent application WO 98/10120 A1 concerns itself with a PVD-coated work piece having at least two consecutive layers consisting of TiN  TiCN  TiAlN  and TiAlCN.<br><br>
A work piece having a wear-reducing coating consisting of combined nitrides  carbonitrides  and carbides of Ti and Al is described in the patent US 2002/0136933 A1.<br><br>
A coated cutting body having a layer consisting of Ti  Al  and N and/or C is patented in JP 05337705 A.  This coating is produced by means of plasma CVD.<br><br>
Coatings having a mixture of fcc-TiAlN and h-AlN (DE 10 2007 000 512 B3) as well as layers of a mixture of fcc-(TiyAlxMe1-x-y)N with h-AlN  whereby Me includes the metals Zr  Hf  V  Nb  Ta  Cr  Mo  W  or Si (US 2004/0115484 A1)  are also known.<br><br>
Nanocomposite layers consisting of fcc-TiAlCN and amorphous carbon are also known (US 2003/143402 Z1; J. Shieh and M.H. Hon  Plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition of titanium aluminum carbonitrides/amorphous-carbon nanocomposite thin films  J. Vac. Sci. Technol.  Jan/Feb 2002  A(20)  (1)  p. 87-92).  These layers are produced by means of plasma CVD.  The nanoscale TiAlCN grains are embedded in a matrix composed of amorphous carbon.<br><br>
Furthermore  it is known to mix additional metals into fcc-TiAlN layers.<br><br>
EP 1 574 594 A1 describes urea PVD layers that contain carbon  having a nanocrystalline structure having the composition (AlxMe1yMe2z)CuE1vE2w with: Me1 and Me2 metals x &gt; 0.4  x + y + z = 1  and y  z = 0  as well as 1 &gt; u &gt; 0 and u = v = w = 1  and v  w = 0.  In this connection  the carbon content is greater in the grain boundaries than in the nanocrystals.<br><br>
A hard-material-coated body having a CVD layer of (Ti Me)1 xAlx(CyNz) with Me – Zr and/or Hf is described in WO 2009/112117 A1.  These layers are characterized by great oxidation resistance and great abrasion resistance.<br><br>
PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The invention is based on the task of developing a layer system for bodies made of metal  hard metal  cermet  or ceramic  which system is single-layered or multi-layered and has at least one hard material composite layer that contains cubic TiAlCN and hexagonal AlN as the main phases and is characterized by a composite structure having a smooth  homogeneous surface  great oxidation resistance  and great hardness.  Included in this task is the development of a method for cost-advantageous production of such coatings.<br><br>
This task is accomplished with the characteristics of the claims  whereby the invention also includes combinations of the individual dependent claims in the sense of an AND link.<br><br>
The bodies coated according to the invention are characterized in that they are coated with a single-layered or multi-layered layer system that has at least one hard material composite layer that contains cubic TiAlCN and hexagonal AlN as the main phases  whereby the cubic TiAlCN is a microcrystalline fcc-Ti1-xAlxCyNz with x &gt; 0.75  y = 0 to 0.25  and z = 0.75 to 1  with a crystallite size of = 0.1 µm  and whereby this composite layer additionally contains carbon with a mass proportion of 0.01% to 20% in the grain boundary region.<br><br>
The TiAlCN coating according to the invention is characterized by a microcrystalline composite structure  whereby the two main phases fcc-Ti1-xAlxCyNz with x &gt; 0.75 and hexagonal AlN guarantee great hardness and oxidation resistance  and the amorphous carbon contributes to reducing the friction.  The great hardness of the composite layer is maintained over a broad composition range  up to 50 mass-% h-AlN.<br><br>
In contrast  TiAlCN nanocomposite layers according to the state of the art possess only limited oxidation resistance  because of the low aluminum content and the embedding of the TiAlCN crystals in amorphous carbon.  The amorphous carbon matrix burns off starting from 400°C.  Therefore cohesion in the nanocomposite layer no longer exists at high temperatures.<br><br>
The TiAlCN layer according to the invention  in contrast  however  demonstrates surprisingly great oxidation resistance up to 800°C.  The high aluminum content of the main components fcc-TiAlCN and hexagonal AlN as well as the microcrystalline structure are obviously the basis for the absorption of a specific amount of friction-reducing amorphous carbon  without any detrimental influence on the oxidation resistance.<br><br>
The coating according to the invention can be provided with the following properties  in practical and advantageous manner:<br><br>
Aside from the microcrystalline fcc-Ti1-xAlxCyNz  further Ti compounds can be contained in the hard material composite layer  which consist of Ti1-xAlxN in the wurtzite structure and/or TiN.<br><br>
The amorphous carbon is preferably present as graphitic sp2 carbon.<br><br>
According to the invention  the multi-layered layer system can consist of multiple TiAlCN hard material composite layers having different contents of amorphous carbon and/or hexagonal AlN.<br><br>
The hard material composite layer can have a gradient with regard to the mass proportion of hexagonal AlN between 0.1% and 50%  and/or with regard to the mass proportion of amorphous carbon between 0.1% and 20%.<br><br>
It is practical if the hard material composite layer according to the invention has a layer thickness between 0.1 µm and 30 µm.<br><br>
The microcrystalline fcc-TiAlCN preferably possesses a crystallite size between 0.1 µm and 1 µm.<br><br>
For the production of such coated bodies  the invention includes a method in which the bodies are provided with at least one hard material composite layer that has microcrystalline fcc-Ti1-xAlxCyNz with x &gt; 0.75  y = 0 to 0.25  and z – 0.75 to 1  and hexagonal AlN  and additionally contains amorphous C with a mass proportion of 0.01% to 20%  whereby the composite layer is deposited onto the body using a gas mixture with Ti  Al  C  and N precursors  in an LPCVD process  at temperatures between 700°C and 900°C  at pressures between 102 Pa and 105 Pa  without additional plasma excitation.<br><br>
The method according to the invention can be configured in practical and advantageous manner  as follows:<br><br>
It is advantageous to use titanium halogenides  aluminum halogenides  reactive nitrogen compounds  hydrocarbons and/or compounds with carbon and nitrogen as precursors for the deposition of the hard material composite layer.<br><br>
It is advantageous to use NH3 as reactive nitrogen compounds and C2H4 or C2H2 as hydrocarbons.<br><br>
It is practical to mix H2 and/or N2 and/or noble gas into the gas mixture for deposition of the hard material composite layer.<br><br>
EXAMPLES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
In the following  the invention is explained in greater detail using exemplary embodiments and the related figures.  The figures show:<br><br>
Fig. 1:	the XRD diffractogram of the hard material composite layer according to Exemplary Embodiment 1  consisting of fcc-TiAlCN  h-AlN  and amorphous carbon  <br><br>
Fig. 2:	the Raman spectrum of the hard material composite layer according to Exemplary Embodiment 1  consisting of fcc-TiAlCN  h-AlN  and amorphous carbon <br><br>
Fig. 3:	the XRD diffractogram of the hard material composite layer according to Exemplary Embodiment 2  consisting of fcc-TiAlCN  h-AlN  and amorphous carbon.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
First  a TiN bonding layer having a thickness of 1 µm is applied to WC/Co hard metal indexable inserts  and subsequently the layer according to the invention is applied by means of a CVD process.<br><br>
The coating process takes place in a hot-wall CVD reactor having an inside diameter of 75 mm.  A gas mixture that contains 51.8 vol.-% H2  1.3 vol.-% AlCl3  0.3 vol.-% TiCl4  25.9 vol.-% Ar  and 4.9 vol.-% NH3  1.3 vol.-% C2H4  as well as 14.5 vol.-% N2  is used for the CVD coating.  The deposition temperature amounts to 850°C  and the process pressure is 0.8 kPa.  After a coating period of 30 min  a TiAlCN layer having a thickness of 5 µm is obtained.<br><br>
By means of WDX examination  a C content of 0.5 at.-%  an aluminum content of 36.2 at.-%  a titanium content of 8.1 at.-%  a chlorine content of 0.3 at.-%  and a nitrogen content of 54.9 at.-% were determined within the layer.<br><br>
This layer was examined by means of X-ray thin-layer analysis  with sweeping incidence (see X-ray diffractogram  Fig. 1).  The diffractogram shows a phase mixture consisting of fcc-TiAlCN and h-AlN.  A Rietveld analysis showed a content of 3.5 ma.-% h-AlN and 96.5 ma.-% fcc-TiAlCN for the crystalline layer components.  Amorphous layer components cannot be determined using the X-ray examination methods.<br><br>
For detection of the amorphous carbon  TEM and Raman examinations were conducted.  The TEM examination showed carbon enrichment in the grain boundary region.   The Raman spectrum (see Fig. 2) contains two broad bands  the first between 1200 and 1400 cm-1  and the second between 1500 and 1700 cm-1  which correspond to the D band and G band of an amorphous sp2 carbon.<br><br>
The crystallite size determined in the TEM examination for the fcc-TiAlCN amounts to 0.4 µm.<br><br>
Microhardness measurements using a Vickers indenter show a hardness of 31.5 ± 0.6 GPa.<br><br>
The hard material layer according to the invention is characterized by a composite structure having a smooth  homogeneous surface  great oxidation resistance  and great hardness.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
First  a TiN bonding layer having a thickness of 1 µm is applied to Si3N4 ceramic indexable inserts  and subsequently the layer according to the invention is applied by means of a CVD process.<br><br>
The coating process takes place in a hot-wall CVD reactor having an inside diameter of 75 mm.  A gas mixture that contains 51.7 vol.-% H2  1.2 vol.-% AlCl3  0.5 vol.-% TiCl4  25.9 vol.-% Ar  and 4.9 vol.-% NH3  1.3 vol.-% C2H4  as well as 14.5 vol.-% N2  is used for the CVD coating.  The deposition temperature amounts to 850°C  and the process pressure is 0.8 kPa.  After a coating period of 25 min  a TiAlCN layer having a thickness of 5 µm is obtained.<br><br>
By means of WDX examination  a C content of 0.6 at.-%  an aluminum content of 36.6 at.-%  a titanium content of 8.7 at.-%  a chlorine content of 0.3 at.-%  and a nitrogen content of 53.8 at.-% were determined within the layer.<br><br>
This layer was examined by means of X-ray thin-layer analysis  with sweeping incidence (see X-ray diffractogram  Fig. 3).  The diffractogram shows a phase mixture consisting of fcc-TiAlCN and h-AlN  with a higher proportion of AlN than in Example 1.  A Rietveld analysis showed a content of 29.0 ma.-% h-AlN and 71.0 ma.-% fcc-TiAlCN for the crystalline layer components.<br><br>
The Raman analysis yields an identical spectrum as in Fig. 2  with D and G bands for amorphous sp2 carbon.<br><br>
The analysis of the layer structure by means of raster electron microscope shows a rather fine-grained structure with a crystallite size of the fcc-TiAlCN of 0.1 µm.<br><br>
The hardness measured with a Vickers indenter amounts to 30.3 ± 0.5 GPa.<br><br>
The hard material layer according to the invention is characterized by a very fine-grained composite structure having a smooth  homogeneous surface  excellent oxidation resistance  and great hardness.<br><br><br>
