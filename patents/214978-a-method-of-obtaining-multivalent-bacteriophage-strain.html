				<td>METHOD OF OBTAINING MULTIVALENT BACTERIOPHAGE STRAIN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns multivalent strains of bacteriophages, methods of<br>
obtaining these, and their application in the treatment of bacterial infections, particularly<br>
those of drug-resistant strains of bacteria.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The bacteriophages (phages) are a diverse group of viruses whose life cycle is connected<br>
exclusively with bacteria cells. Bacteriophages are characterized by a lysogenic or lytic life<br>
cycle. As anti-bacterial agents, lytic bacteriophages are especially useful which, after<br>
infection by bacteria cells to which they are sensitive, they replicate within them, leading<br>
to their total destruction (by lysis) and the release of new phages which attack and destroy<br>
subsequent bacteria cells. This process may occur both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
One of the essential characteristics of bacteriophages is the well-known high specificity of<br>
their lytic activity. This feature is exploited in, for example, species determination (phage<br>
typing) of various bacteria (see, for example, patent descriptions GB 2285684, US<br>
5824468 and SU 543260, as well as the international patent notifications WO 0100786 and<br>
WO 0109370). Other known applications of bacteriophages include their usefulness as<br>
tools in molecular biology, for example in the expression and selection of specific proteins<br>
(e.g. patent description US 6027930), and in sterilization and cleansing media (e.g. patent<br>
descriptions EP 0414304, EP 0290295 and GB 2253859, as well as the international patent<br>
notifications WO 9808944 and WO 9003122). Modified phages are used in the production<br>
of vaccines (e.g. WO 9505454). Certain proteins of bacteriophage origin are also used (e.g.<br>
EP 0510907, US 5470573, WO 9607329). The methods of isolating bacteriophages and<br>
obtaining phage preparations are well known and are constantly being perfected (e.g. GB<br>
829266, CS 192212, RU 2109055).<br>
Phage therapy has been employed on a wide scale since the Second World War at the<br>
Institute of Microbiology and Virology of Tbilisi, Georgia. A bank of various phage<br>
preparations is used there in the treatment of bacterial infections and in prophylaxis.<br>
Available data indicate a great effectiveness of phage therapy. Similar research has been<br>
conducted in Poland for over 25 years. At the Bacteriophage Laboratory of the Institute of<br>
Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Wroclaw<br>
the phage therapy is used treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant forms of bacteria<br>
and those not susceptible to antibiotics (see: Stefan Slopek et al., Archivum Immunologiae<br>
et Therapiae Experimentalis, 1981, 31, 293; Stefan Slopek et al., Archivum Immunologiae<br>
et Therapiae Experimentalis, 1983, 31, 267; Stefan Slopek et al., Archivum Immunologiae<br>
et Therapiae Experimentalis, 1984, 32, 317; Stefan Slopek et al., Archivum Immunologiae<br>
et Therapiae Experimentalis, 1985, 33, 219; Stefan Slopek et al., Archivum Immunologiae<br>
et Therapiae Experimentalis, 1985, 33, 241; Stefan Slopek et al., Archivum Immunologiae<br>
et Therapiae Experimentalis, 1987, 35, 569; Beata Weber-Dabrowska et al., Archivum<br>
Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis, 2000, 48, 31-37; Beata Weber-Dabrowska et<br>
al., Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis, 2000, 48, 547-551). The phage<br>
therapy carried out there over the last 14 years, which has included 1473 patients with<br>
purulent infections of different tissues and organs, indicates the high efficacy of phage<br>
therapy.<br>
Complete abatement of disease symptoms and return to health was noted in 1289 cases. It<br>
must be emphasized that in at least a dozen or so cases phage therapy presented the only<br>
possibility of eliminating the life-threatening infection. The therapy conducted concerned<br>
individual patients. It consisted of:<br>
a) the growth and identification of bacterial strains isolated from material obtained from<br>
the patient,<br>
b) determination of the susceptibility of the strain to specific phages and selection of the<br>
phage showing the highest lytic activity towards the strain,<br>
c) preparation of a phage lysate with a large number of phage particles,<br>
d) production of a sterile phage preparation for treatment.<br>
This procedure is rather costly, laborious and time consuming. At times, 7-10 days pass<br>
from the moment of obtaining the research material to the availability of the finished,<br>
sterilized phage preparation for treatment. Such a delay is too long in certain disease states.<br>
Phage therapy on a broad scale cannot be carried out with the procedure employed thus far.<br>
Infections accompanying mucoviscidosis present a particular problem. This is a<br>
hereditary, systemic disease consisting of dysfunction of mucous-secreting glands,<br>
predisposing the patient to chronic bronchial and pulmonary diseases. Secreted mucous is<br>
thick and sticky, making its elimination by natural routes (coughing) difficult. The<br>
accumulation and lingering of mucous in the bronchi and the impairment in clearing it<br>
create favorable conditions for bacterial infections, leading to chronic bronchitis and<br>
pneumonia. The most threatening pathogens causing infections accompanying<br>
mucoviscidosis are Staphylococcus aureus and bacilli of the genus Pseudonomas.<br>
Permanently recurring infections by these micro-organisms lead to serious pathological<br>
changes in the respiratory system and premature death. Few patients survive more than 25<br>
years. Treatment of such infections with the available antibiotics has created a serious<br>
therapeutic problem worldwide, especially in the past few years. Antibiotic therapy of<br>
these infections has become less and less effective because the vast majority of the<br>
bacterial strains show resistance to all antibiotics, including the antibiotic of last resort -<br>
vancomycin. There is, therefore, an urgent need to introduce an alternative therapeutic<br>
method into medical practice for the treatment of refractory and highly dangerous bacterial<br>
infections.<br>
THE GOAL OF THE INVENTION<br>
The past years have seen a massive spread of bacterial strains resistant to all antibiotics,<br>
including vancomycin, the antibiotic of last resort. As a result, treatment of bacterial<br>
infections induced by these drug-resistant forms with antibiotics is ineffective. This<br>
situation has created dramatic therapeutic problems. Thus, there is an urgent need of<br>
introducing alternative therapeutic methods into medical practice for the treatment of<br>
refractory bacterial infections.<br>
In consideration of the above goal, this invention is an elaboration of a method of obtaining<br>
multivalent phage strains which can be used in the production of preparations of<br>
guaranteed effectiveness in the treatment of bacterial infections without the necessity of<br>
individual phage selection in each instance. In this particular realization, the goal of the<br>
invention is the presentation of a way which allows obtaining phage preparations of high<br>
purity, in particular free of endotoxin.<br>
A particular goal of the invention is to obtain polyvalent phage preparations which may<br>
be effectively employed in the treatment of bacterial infections connected with<br>
mucoviscidosis without the necessity of individual phage selection in each instance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method of obtaining multivalent bacteriophage strain,<br>
by which:<br>
a) a sufficient number (n) of different strains of bacterial pathogens of a defined genus<br>
accumulates, appearing randomly in a given region, whereby the isolated bacterial<br>
strains are preferably drug-resistant,<br>
b) a sufficient number of different bacteriophage strains, specific to at least one of the<br>
bacterial strains of the given genus, accumulates,<br>
c) the lytic activity of an accumulated bacteriophage strain on each accumulated bacterial<br>
strain is determined, then the value p, which is the proportion of the number of strains<br>
lysed by a given phage to the number of all the accumulated bacterial strains, is<br>
calculated.<br>
d) for the resultant value of p, it is tested whether n fulfils the condition:<br>
where: q = 1 -p<br>
d is a constant no larger than 0.1, optimally no larger that 10% p<br>
z1-a is a random variable of the normal distribution dependent on the confidence<br>
factor 1 - a, which is not less that 0.95,<br>
e) the bacteriophage strain is selected which fulfils the criterion defined in d) and has a<br>
value of p not less than 2/n, preferably not less than 0.5.<br>
The range of the lytic activity of each isolated bacteriophage is determined with<br>
regard to the population of pathogenic bacterial strains present in the given region. To this<br>
end, a sufficiently large collection of randomly chosen drug-resistant bacterial strains must<br>
be accumulated. With reference to the established large sample of bacteria of a population<br>
size of n strains (in the example described, n was 845 and 880, respectively, for the drug-<br>
resistant strains of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus isolated in Poland), the frequency of<br>
success is calculated, or the proportion of the number of strains lysed by a given phage to<br>
the total number of strains studied. This frequency is regarded as the probability of success<br>
p. The probability of failure is then q=1-p.<br>
It is essential to choose the size n that a sample must have so that it can be regarded as<br>
representative of the general population of the strains of the given genus (e.g.<br>
Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus). To this end, the following criterion for the sample to be<br>
representative is established:<br>
The probability that the absolute value of the difference between the sample frequency v<br>
and the probability of success p is less than the pre-assigned value of d is 1 - a, which<br>
corresponds with a confidence level of 1 - a. The value of 1 - a is usually set at 0.95 or<br>
0.98.<br>
The number of samples n should fulfil the condition:<br>
where z1-a is a random variable of the normal distribution. For 1 - a= 0.95, z1-a =1.96, and<br>
for 1 - a= 0.98, z1-a = 2.33.<br>
Based on this criterion and on the value of the frequency p obtained for the characterized<br>
phage, by assigning reasonable values to d and the confidence range 1 - a it is possible to<br>
verify the magnitude « used to determine the range of lytic activity of a given phage and<br>
ascertain whether the lytic activity obtained for this n, with the assigned values of d and 1 -<br>
a, may be regarded as correct with respect to the general population of the bacterial strains<br>
of the given genus.<br>
The strain of bacteriophages is preferably isolated in step b) from a sample<br>
originating from the environment by passing it through a membrane filter of pore size 0.2 -<br>
0.4 µm, adding culture medium to the filtrate and mixing it with a broth culture of bacteria<br>
of the defined genus, incubating this at a temperature of about 37°C for approximately one<br>
hour, removing a portion of the suspension and smearing it onto plates with solid culture<br>
medium, incubating at approx. 37°C for 2 to 24 hours, isolating a sample of the medium<br>
surrounding the individual bald spot, transferring it to the broth culture of bacteria of<br>
defined genus, and incubating until the culture clears, and obtaining the bacteriophage<br>
preparation by passing the lysate through a membrane filter of pore size 0.2 - 0.4 µm,<br>
whereby it is preferred to repeat the inoculation of the solid culture medium and re-<br>
isolation of the bald spots 5 times.<br>
The bacterial strains in step c) are preferably inoculated onto solid culture medium, onto<br>
which a portion of the bacteriophage preparation obtained in step b) is deposited, incubated<br>
at about 37 °C for around 4 hours, after which the temperature is set at about 4 °C for<br>
around 2 to 24 hours, by which the lytic activity of the bacteriophage strain is evidenced by<br>
the appearance of, at least, individual bald spots.<br>
It is possibly to carry out then further purification of the lysate, particularly with regard to<br>
endotoxin, whereby the mixture containing bacteriophages is in contact with a substrate<br>
containing cellulose or a partially esterified derivative of it, then rinsed with a solution that<br>
removes impurities, especially endotoxin, after which the purified bacteriophages are<br>
washed out. The endotoxin can be effectively eluted with water, a solution of a non-<br>
dissociating substance, or a saline solution of concentration no greater than 0.1 M, possibly<br>
buffered. The bacteriophage fraction can also be effectively eluted with a solution of a<br>
non-dissociating substance, or any buffer, or a saline solution of concentration greater than<br>
0.05 M, possibly buffered. Also, elution of endotoxin and bacteriophages are carried out at<br>
temperatures between -25 °C and +100 °C. Preferably, the endotoxin and bacteriophage<br>
elution can be done using an aqueous saline solution containing organic solvent. The<br>
organic solvent is best selected from a group comprising dimethyl sulphoxide,<br>
dimethylformamide, isopropanol and acetone, and as a substrate cellulose partially<br>
esterified with organic or inorganic acid can be used. It may be used a substrate of<br>
cellulose partially esterified with acetic, nitric, sulphurous or phosphoric acid, in particular<br>
cellulose may be used as a substrate of which 0.01 to 5 % of the glucose molecules have<br>
been esterified, preferably 0.25 to 1%, more preferably from 0.5 to 1% of the glucose<br>
molecules.<br>
Preferably the pathogenic bacterial strains are of the genera Staphylococcus or<br>
Pseudomonas.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a .medication for the treatment or prevention of<br>
infections caused by bacterial pathogens which contains an active agent and a possible<br>
pharmaceutically admissible carrier, such that the active agent is comprised of a<br>

staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus), including the methicillin-resistant strains thereof,<br>
and the blue pus bacillus (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which appear in those afflicted with<br>
mucoviscidosis in particular. These species are currently the cause of serious infections<br>
causing high mortality.<br>
THE VIRTUES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The introduction into therapy of polyvalent phage preparations containing multivalent<br>
phages obtained by means of this invention is a major development in combating bacterial<br>
infections which are not susceptible to treatment with antibiotics. Certain economic<br>
advantages are also connected with this new technology. It allows a significant reduction in<br>
material costs and shortens the time from collecting material for examination to obtaining<br>
the therapeutic phage preparation. Thanks to this, the phage preparation will wait for the<br>
patient, and not the patient for the production of the individual phage preparation.<br>
The broad range of lytic phage preparations composed of several multivalent phages<br>
obtained by means of the method of this invention is a very important advantage from the<br>
viewpoint of their application in the treatment of bacterial infections. It is well known that<br>
within a bacterial population, forms resistant to a bacteriophage can appear with a<br>
frequency of about 1x10-7. In the presence of two phages, the frequency of such mutation<br>
is about 1x10-14, and with three phages only 1x10-21. With such an arrangement, the<br>
problem of bacterial strain resistance to phages practically does not exist.<br>
The great applicability of the exemplified medications composed of multivalent phages<br>
deserves special emphasis. They may be employed in the medical practice in general and<br>
allow an effective means of coping with threatening bacterial infections. It is also possible<br>
to exploit phages obtained in accordance with this invention in the preparation of<br>
medications for external use, employing them, for example, in the treatment and<br>
prevention of dermatological infections. It has been found that oral administration of phage<br>
lysates obtained according to this invention increases resistance to possible future bacterial<br>
infection.<br>
In certain cases, phage therapy can be used in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.<br>
Polyvalent phage preparations used in the treatment of bacterial infections have been show<br>
to be highly effective. Particular effectiveness has been observed in the treatment of sepsis<br>
(88% cure rate) and in the treatment of infections in patients with mucoviscidosis.<br>

For a better understanding of the essence of the invention, it is illustrated below through<br>
examples.<br>
Example 1. Bacteriophage isolation<br>
Bacteriophages for Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were isolated from municipal<br>
sewage. The sewage was passed through a membrane filter with a pore size of 0.2 - 0.4<br>
µm,, which captures the bacteria but allows the bacteriophages to pass through. From "the<br>
resultant filtrate, concentrated fluid culture medium was added and different dilutions of<br>
filtrate were mixed with young broth cultures of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus or<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour, after which<br>
0.2 ml of suspension was extracted from each sample with a pipette and smeared onto<br>
plates containing agar medium using a glass rod and the plates were incubated overnight at<br>
37 °C. In the event that the sought after phage was present on the plates inoculated with the<br>
suitable dilution of filtrate containing the young bacterial culture, a uniform<br>
(nebulous) growth of bacteria and separate, transparent small fields, the so-called bald<br>
spots, were observed, which usually contained several million phage particles. The<br>
individual bald spot together with the agar surrounding it were cut out with the aid of a<br>
platinum loop, then transferred to a fresh broth culture of bacteria and incubated until the<br>
culture cleared. After passing it through a membrane filter of pore size 0.2 - 0.4 µm, which<br>
holds back any bacteria remaining in the lysate, the filtrate contained only bacteriophages.<br>
The inoculation of different dilutions of the obtained phages with the respective bacteria on<br>
agar medium, and the re-isolation of the bald spots was carried out 5 times, which allowed<br>
obtaining a pure line of phages.<br>
Example 2. Determining the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus strains to<br>
bacteriophage microorganisms specific to them.<br>
Susceptibility was determined using the culture medium described by Wahl. Plates with<br>
this medium were dried at a temperature of 37 °C for 30 minutes, covered with a young, 4-<br>
hour broth culture of Staphylococcus aureus which was mixed by shaking, the excess of<br>
the suspension was removed with a pipette and again dried for 30 minutes at 37 °C. On one<br>
plate, divided into 6 segments, the susceptibilities of the strain under studv was determined<br>
to 6 different but specific bacteriophages. One drop of a 1/10 bacteriophage dilution was<br>
placed onto the surface of each segment. The plates were incubated in an oven at 37 °C for<br>
about 4 hours, after which they were placed in a refrigerator until the following day. In the<br>
event of a high susceptibility of the strain to the defined phage, transparent fields are<br>
visible at the place where the phage was introduced onto the culture medium which was<br>
uniformly covered with bacterial growth, these being the result of the total destruction of<br>
bacteria cells (lysis). Less susceptibility of the strain is manifested by the appearance of<br>
individual bald spots.<br>
Example 3. Determining the susceptibility of strains of Pseudomonas to bacteriophage<br>
microorganisms specific to them.<br>
The method of determining the sensitivity was similar to that described in Example<br>
2. In this case, though, the stock medium was agar with a phosphate buffer supplement and<br>
the incubation time of the plates deposited phage was 5 hours.<br>
Example 4. Selecting phages with the broadest spectrum of activity with regard to<br>
Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas strains - obtaining multivalent phage strains.<br>
Bacteriophages were isolated according to the method described in Example 1. The<br>
susceptibilities of 845 drug-resistant clinical strains of various species of Staphylococcus<br>
isolated from all over Poland to phages from the collection of bacteriophages specific to<br>
Staphylococcus, and the susceptibilities of 880 drug-resistant clinical strains of different<br>
species of Pseudomonas to phages from the collection of bacteriophages specific to<br>
Pseudomonas were determined.<br>
An analysis of the susceptibilities of both groups of strains to the respective phages<br>
allowed the selection of phages of unexpectedly high activity and broad spectrum of lytic<br>
effect. These phages are presented in tables 1 and 2.<br>
The results for phages S1-S7 and P1-P20 were submitted to statistical analysis in order to<br>
determine whether the p values obtained for the particular phages may be considered<br>
correct for the general populations of the respective genera of bacteria. The results are<br>
presented in Figures 1 and 2. The calculated values of n for most of the bacteriophages<br>
were lower than the number of bacterial strains of the research samples, which suggests<br>
that the ranges of the lytic spectra are at least correct with regard to the clinical strains<br>
appearing in Poland. Considering these results, the phages listed in Tables 1 and 2 may be<br>
regarded as multivalent phages with regard to this invention.<br>
Unexpectedly, in the case of the phages for Staphylococcus, 3 of the 7 most active, i.e. S1,<br>
S2 and S4 or S5, displayed lytic activity on 95% of the Staphylococus strains studied. Also,<br>
3 of the 21 selected phages for Pseudomonas, i.e. P7, P20 and P6, displayed lytic activity<br>
on 87% of the Pseudomonas strains studied.<br>
One may also regard patients suffering from mucoviscidosis as a "given region of the<br>
appearance of bacterial infection", as defined in the essence of the invention. In the study<br>
of the pathogens appearing in this group of patients, 137 bacterial strains were used, of<br>
which 84 were identified as Pseudomonas and 53 as S. aureus. All the strains were isolated<br>
from material originating from mucoviscidosis patients from all over Poland. Analysis of<br>
the susceptibility of the strains of Pseudomonas and S. aureus studied to phages allowed<br>
the selection of phages with the highest lytic activity and the broadest range of action.<br>
Unexpectedly, in the case of phages for Pseudomonas, 3 of the 21 active phagjps, i.e.<br>
F/00010, F/0013 and F/00018, displayed lytic activity on 75% of the Pseudomonas strains<br>
(for the probability of success, see fig. 3, in which phage 3 = F/00010, phage 6 = F/00013,<br>
and phage 11 = F/00018). Among the selected phages for Staphylococcus, 3, i.e. F/00002.<br>
F/00004 and F/00007, displayed lytic activity on 98% of the Staphylococcus strains (for<br>
the probability of success, see fig. 4, in which phage 1 = F/00002, phage 3 = F/00004, and<br>
phage 4 = F/00007).<br>
Example 5. Replicating phages to Staphylococcus and phages to Gram-negative bacilli,<br>
obtaining phage lysates.<br>
Approximately 5% phage lysate was added to young, 4-hour cultures of Staphylococcus<br>
aureus (logarithmic phase) in broth medium supplemented by glucose. The test tubes or<br>
bottles were mixed by shaking and incubated for 3 hours at 37 °C. After the appearance of<br>
a clear culture (lysis), the samples were kept cold until the following day. The lysate was<br>
passed through a membrane filter of pore size 0.2-04 µm to remove any remaining unlysed<br>
bacteria cells. The concentration of live phage particles was determined by the two-layer<br>
method of Gratia. An incubated culture without the addition of phage lysate<br>
served as a control.<br>
Replicating phages to Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas). Peptone water was used to<br>
replicate phages to Pseudomonas. 5% phage lysate was added to a young, 4-hour culture of<br>
Pseudomonas aeurginosa, the test tubes or bottles were mixed by shaking and the samples<br>
were incubated for 5 hours at 37 °C. After the culture had cleared up, the samples were left<br>
until the following day in a refrigerator, after which they were filtered through a membrane<br>
filter with pore size as above. The number of live phage particles in the lysate was<br>
determined by the method of Gratia<br>
The sterile broth phage lysates show long-lasting lytic activity. When kept cold, they<br>
maintain their vitality for several years, in some cases over 10 years.<br>
Example 6. The production and application of polyvalent phage preparations.<br>
The sterile broth lysate obtained by the method described in Example 5, originating from<br>
the phages selected with a broad spectrum of lytic activity in Example 4, or their<br>
concentrated or further purified forms (see the following example), served in the<br>
preparation of polyvalent phage medications.<br>
The exemplified polyvalent phage preparation to Staphylococcus is a mixture containing<br>
different amounts of the lysates of phages S1, S2 and S4 or S5, or derivatives of these<br>
lysates. For infections arising from Staphylococcus in mucoviscidosis patients,<br>
preparations from phages F/00002, F/00004 and F/00007 should be used.<br>
The exemplified polyvalent phage preparation to Pseudomonas is a mixture containing<br>
different amounts of the lysates of phages P7, P20 and P6, or derivatives of these lysates.<br>
For infections arising from Pseudomonas in mucoviscidosis patients, preparations from<br>
phages F/00010, F/00013 and F/00018 should be used.<br>
The medication is administered orally 3 times daily, in quantities corresponding to 10 ml<br>
of lysate, 30 minutes before meals, after previous neutralization of stomach fluids (e.g.<br>
with Gel Alumini phosphorici, purified soda or VIchy water). When applying the<br>
preparation directly onto wounds, it should be done 3 times over 24 hours. By local<br>
application, the wound should not be cleansed with disinfectant, as this may lead to<br>
inactivation of the phages. If necessary, wounds may be cleansed with a sterile<br>
culture medium or a 0.9% NaCl physiological solution.<br>
In certain cases, phage therapy may be employed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.<br>
The polyvalent phage preparations used in the treatment of bacterial infections have<br>
displayed high effectiveness. Particular efficacy has been observed in the treatment of<br>
sepsis (88% cure rate) and infections arising in mucoviscidosis patients.<br>
Example 7. Further purification of bacteriophage preparations, removing endotoxin from<br>
mixtures containing bacteriophages.<br>
In several medical applications, or also due to methods of administration (e.g.<br>
intravenously), bacteriophage preparations of high purity are required, in particular that<br>
they be devoid of bacterial endotoxin. Following the method of this invention, the affinity<br>
of bacteriophages to a substrate containing cellulose or, optimally, an esterified derivative<br>
of it, was used. A commercially available sulphated derivative of cellulose was used in this<br>
example, which was characterized by a low level of esterification (8 µmole/ml of gel). The<br>
substrate was used to remove endotoxin from the mixture containing bacteriophages. After<br>
rinsing the substrate and removing the endotoxin, the next step of purification is the elution<br>
of the adsorbed bacteriophages.<br>
One ml of substrate containing the sulphated derivative of cellulose was put into the sterile<br>
column of a chromatograph. Efflux of the substrate from the column was prevented by<br>
sealing the lower part of the column with glass wool soaked with 70% ethanol.<br>
The following elution buffers were prepared:<br>
Buffer I: 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.6;<br>
Buffer E: 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 M sodium chloride.<br>
The salts entering into the composition of the eluent were baked for 1 hour at 145 °C<br>
The solutions were prepared using distilled apyrogenic water.<br>
Before chromatography, 1 ml of substrate was filled into a chromatograph column rinsed<br>
with 5 ml of buffer I, and then 5 ml of buffer II.<br>
The column was prepared for the actual chromatography by rinsing it with 10 ml buffer I.<br>
Removal of endotoxin was accomplished by using the large-molecule fraction obtained<br>
in the molecular sieve procedure on Sepharose 4B of the concentrated bacteriophage lysate<br>
Ps PCM F/00018.<br>
0.2 ml of the bacteriophage mixture was transferred to a chromatograph column containing<br>
1 ml substrate containing the sulphated derivative of cellulose. A fraction of 0.2 ml volume<br>
was taken. The first fraction was eluted with 3 ml of buffer I. Under these conditions, non-<br>
associated endotoxin flowed out from the column. The second fraction was eluted with<br>
buffer II. Fraction II contained purified bacteriophages.<br>
The results of units of endotoxin in the fractions:<br>
The material submitted to chromatography on a substrate containing a sulphated derivative<br>
of cellulose contained 2500 units of endotoxin/ml. The fraction eluted with buffor I<br>
contained 600 - 1000 units of endotoxin/ml, and that eluted with buffer II contained<br>
bacteriophages devoid of endotoxin (about 1 unit/ml).<br>
The content of endotoxin in the bacteriophage preparations was determined using the gel<br>
method of the company Charles River Endosafe, Charleston, USA.<br>
