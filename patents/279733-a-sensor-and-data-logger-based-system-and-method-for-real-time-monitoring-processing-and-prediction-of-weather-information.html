				<td>A SYSTEM AND A METHOD FOR AUTOMATIC COLLECTION, REAL-TIM K MONITORING AND PROCESSING OF WEATHER DATA<br>
Technical Held<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method lor real lime collection, monitoring and processing of weather data. Background and prior art<br>
Weather monitoring and prediction is a veiy important aspect in today's technologically developed world. The Weather information is especially critical for people who depend on weather for their livelihood, like the farmers and agriculturalists. Farmers who operate in hilly regions, grow specialized crops, and depend upon irrigation. If accurate weather monitoring is achieved, then they can plan their activities based on the predicted weather conditions. I lowe\ er, they can significantly improve their output, if they have more specific weather in ibrmation.<br>
An example of ho•*/ important weather predictions are can be seen in the case of citrus grooves where citrus crops arc grown. In the citrus grooves, even a one-degree difference in the temperature other than the temperature required can ruin the crop totally. Therefore, weather monitoring and prediction techniques art used to accurately prcdict the weather conditions. Once the weather prediction is accurate, accordingly the farmers can dccidc whether they need to use extra machinery to provide necessary warmth to the crops. This rcducis the expenses, because running the machines on every cold night would be too costly.<br>
Another example where specialized weather monitoring and prediction is required is for crops that arc cntitoly dependent upon irrigation. Knowledge of exact weather conditions in the fields can he p optimize the use of irrigation.<br>
In addition to theii use lo farmers and agriculturists, general weather information is also useful for comnu n people. Therefore a necessity was felt for monitoring weather information over lurgc areas of land. For achieving the weather information over a large area, a number of weather stations are placed at different locations. These weather stations are usually located at prominent places like airports, universities, etc. All these different weather stations accumulate weather information and this information is processed to predit t weather information for these areas. The raw data from each weather station is brought together by different means, to a central location where it is processed into useful information. Maps are created summarizing the information for continents, nations, states and portions of states. This general weather information is of utmost value to people who ure planning their days based on the weather conditions and also weather influenced companies like airlines, shipping lines and trucking companies which are planning their depa/ture and routes over vast distances.<br>
Genera! weather information is also useful to farmers who operate in flat areas including the planes and prairies where they grow commodity crops such as wheal, corn, soya beans and forage crops that are only minimally influenced by weather on any given day. US Patent 592082/ describes a wireless weather station for measuring a number of weather parameters over an extended time at a data collection location. The weather data can be transmitted to a remote location using lesser power and apparently real-time continuous transmission. The sensor assembly is positioned at the dala collecting locations and powered by a solar rechargeable battery backup.<br>
US Patent 5717589 describes a real-time weather tracking and prediction of future movements of weather. The method provided here is made of steps of integration of real¬time weather dala rom sources, combining this data with geographical information and then integrating tht real-time weather and geographical data to compute and display the prcdictcd and expei ted movement of the weather conditions.<br>
US Patent 6330519 provides a visibility sensor system, which includes a housing having a sensor head opcr ing. A removable sensor head assembly is removably coupled to the housing within the tensor head opening. The sensor head assembly has a sensor enclosure and a connector. \n electronics module is coupled to the sensor head through the connector. A rain s insor determines the presence of rain and causes shutters to cover the openings in the sen &gt;or enclosure. Objects of the present invention<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a system for a real time collection, monitoring and processing of weather data. The present invention uses and communicates with many external sources of weather datu for its input data. The invention is capable of using input data frc m sources in addition to those it uses at (tie present lime, and should therefore not be limited solely to the data sources employed to-date. The embodiments if the present invention are described by referring to accompanied diagrams. Figl is a block diagrammatic representation of the system of the present invention. The syst Jm of the present invention broadly comprises at least a field unit for the collection of wnd dissemination.<br>

One of the sensors 1 used in the present invention is a rainfall sensor, wherein a tipping bucket rain gauge ii used to sense the amount of rainfall in the area. This tipping buckct gauge uses a tipping bucket mechanism to produce a contacl closure every time it receives a predetermined quantity of rainfall. Hie body and funnel of the rainfull sensor arc made of IKP (Fiber glass Reinforced Plastic) and the rim is made of gunmctal. All parts of the sensor are in contact with waler and are made of stainless steel, l iach tip of <br>
the bucket produces m on-off output when the magnet passes over the reed switch. Rainfall entering through funnel collector is directed to the tipping bucket assembly. When an incremental amount of precipitation has been collected, the bucket assembly tips and activates a magnetic reed switch. The sample is discharged through the base of the gauge. A momentary electrical contact closure is provided for each increment of rainfall. This contact closure is used to operate the Kvcnt Recorder or data acquisition systems. A level is provided on the base for correct positioning of the unit. The funnel has a screen to prevent debris from entering the gauge.<br>
Another sensor, which is a wind speed sensor (2) or the anemometer is used to sense the speed of the wind, l i e wind speed sensor has a three-cup rotor, which is a fast response low threshold opto-cl jctronic unit. When rotated by wind, a choppcr on the anemometer shaft interrupts an infrared light source, generating pulses from a phototran.sistor. The signal is amplified ,tnd fed through a line driver. The frequency of the pulses is proportional to wind jpeed. The ancmometeris provided with a 3-pin connector for easy replacement and conv-s with 10 meters of shielded cable.<br>
Yet another sensor in the form wind direction sensor is used which senses the direction of the wind. The wind direction sensor is basically a wind vane coupled to a lincur endless potentiometer. The v.ind vane used is a counter balunced, low threshold wind vane. A Linear, wire wound t ndlcss potentiometer is coupled to the vane by an SS shaft .As the vane turns, it rotates a stainless steel shall which is coupled to the potentiometer. This potentiometer has cxt ellent linearity, very low starting torque.<br>
