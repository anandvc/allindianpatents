MEDICINAL COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Nitrogen-containing aromatic ring derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 1 have actions in vitro such as 1) the inhibition of infiltrating tube formation by vascular endothelial cells induced by an angiogenic factor mixture solution; 2) the inhibition of tube formation by vascular endothelial cells induced specifically by a single angiogenic factor; 3) the inhibition of angiogenic factor receptor kinase; and 4) the inhibition of cancer cell growth, and hence are extremely useful as angiogenic inhibitors and the like.<br>
[3]	<br>
[Patent Document 1]: WO 02/32872 Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[4]	The present inventors have found that while studying on formulating the above nitrogen-containing aromatic ring derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing the above nitrogen- containing aromatic ring derivatives as active ingredients are sometimes rendered unstable. Specifically, of the nitrogen- containing aromatic ring derivatives disclosed in Patent Document 1, this holds true for the nitrogen-containing aromatic ring derivatives having a structure wherein the quinoline skeleton is linked to another heterocyclic group through an ether bond. In particular, in pharmaceutical compositions, such nitrogen-containing aromatic ring derivatives are readily decomposed under humidified and heated storage conditions; and moreover, gelation readily occurs on the surface of the pharmaceutical compositions, so that when the pharmaceutical compositions are stored under humidified conditions, delayed dissolution of the active ingredients may occur due to <br>
moisture absorption.<br>
[5]	Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a stable pharmaceutical composition comprising a nitrogen- containing aromatic ring derivative, wherein under humidified and heated storage conditions, the decomposition of the above derivative is sufficiently reduced, or the gelation on the surface of the pharmaceutical composition is sufficiently inhibited.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[6]	To attain the above object, the present invention provides the pharmaceutical composition described below.<br>
[7]	The pharmaceutical composition comprising:<br>
an active ingredient consisting of 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide represented by Formula (1) described below, salt thereof, or solvate of the foregoing; and<br>
(i)	a compound, a 5% (w/w) aqueous solution or suspension of which has a pH of 8 or more; and/or<br><br>
(1)<br>
(ii)	silicic acid, salt thereof, or solvate of the foregoing. [Formula 1]<br>
h a<br>
XXX<br><br><br>
H2N H3C<br>
[0008] In such pharmaceutical composition, the decomposition of the compound represented by Formula (1), an active ingredient, under humidified and heated storage conditions is sufficiently reduced. Moreover, the gelation on the surface of the pharmaceutical composition is inhibited, and thereby the problem of delayed dissolution of the active ingredient after the pharmaceutical composition has been kept under humidified storage conditions is <br>
solved. Therefore, difficulties during a disintegration test or a dissolution test caused by the surface gelation of the pharmaceutical composition are eliminated, and humidity and the like do not affect the pharmaceutical composition so that the quality of the pharmaceutical composition can be ensured for a long time.<br>
[9]	It is considered that under humidified and heated storage conditions, the suppression of the decomposition is brought about mainly by (i) the compound whose pH of a 5% (w/w) aqueous solution or suspension thereof is 8 or more, whereas the inhibition of the gelation is brought about mainly by (ii) silicic acid, salt thereof, or solvate of the foregoing. Therefore, according to requirements for the pharmaceutical composition, (i) or (ii) can be added alone or in combination thereto.<br>
	Further, it is considered that the decomposition of 4-(3- chloro-4-(cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide (hereinafter, also referred to as the "medicament X"), salt thereof, or solvate of the foregoing under humidified and heated storage conditions proceed based on the following mechanism (hereinafter, also the decomposed product having a quinoline skeleton is referred to as the "decomposed product A" and the decomposed product having 3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)amino group as the "decomposed product B").<br>
[Formula 2]<br><br><br>
Medicament X	Decomposed Product A Decomposed Product B<br>
[0011] According to these findings, a process for improving stability of the pharmaceutical composition and a process for inhibiting gelation thereof are provided. Specifically, provided are a <br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[15]	An embodiment of the present invention is explained in detail in the following paragraphs. Herein, the expression "having a diffraction peak at a diffraction angle (20 + 0.2°) of X°" means to have a diffraction peak at a diffraction angle (20) of from (X - 0.2)° to (X + 0.2)°.

[28]	(Process for Preparing the Active Ingredient)<br>
As for the process for preparing the compound represented by Formula (1), the description in WO 02/32872 can be used as a reference. The processes for preparing the polymorphic crystals (A') and the polymorphic crystals (B') are described in the following paragraphs.<br>
[29]	The polymorphic crystals (A1) can be obtained by a preparation process described below: 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide is dissolved in an organic solvent, a good solvent (for example, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylimidazolidine, 1- methyl-2-pyrrolidinone,	N,N-dimethylformamide,	N,N- dimethylacetamide, acetic acid, sulfolane, etc.), and then thereto a poor solvent (for example, water, acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, or a mixture thereof, etc.) is admixed rapidly (for example, within 10 min.).<br>
[30]	The polymorphic crystals (A1) can be obtained by another preparation process described below: 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide is dissolved while stirring in an organic<br>
solvent, a good solvent (for example, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylimidazolidine,	1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone,	N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, acetic acid, sulfolane, etc.), and then thereto a poor solvent (for example, water, acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, n- propanol, isopropanol, or a mixture thereof, etc.) is admixed so that the resultant crystals precipitate when the stirring is stopped.<br>
[31]	The polymorphic crystals (A') can be obtained by still another preparation process described below: 7-methoxy-4- chloroquinoline-6-carboxamide and l-(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3- cyclopropylurea are reacted in the presence of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide, cesium carbonate, potassium carbonate, etc.) in an organic solvent that works a good solvent for 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide (for example, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylimidazolidinone,	1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone,	N,N- dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, sulfolane, etc.), and then thereto a poor solvent is admixed rapidly (for example, within 10 min.).<br>
[32]	More specifically, for example, to a mixture of l-(2- chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea,	7-methoxy-4- chloroquinoline-6-carboxamide (one equivalent or more based on 1- (2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea), and potassium t- butoxide (one equivalent or more based on l-(2-chloro-4- hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea), DMSO in a volume 5 to 10 times based on l-(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea is added at room temperature, and then the mixture is heated to from 55 to 75°C while stirring for 20 hr. or longer to allow the reaction to proceed. To this reaction mixture, while heating at from 60 to 65°C and stirring, a poor solvent (20 to 50% acetone in water or 20 to 50% 2-propanol in water) in a volume 15 times based on l-(2-chloro-4- hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea is introduced within 8 min. so that crystals can appear. Further, it is preferred to add the seed<br>
crystals when the poor solvent is introduced to allow the crystals to appear. The polymorphic crystals (A1) can be obtained by stirring the resulting reaction mixture, in which the crystals appeared, at the temperature ranging from room temperature to 40°C generated by heating for 3 hr. or longer to collect the crystals by filtration.<br>
[33]	The polymorphic crystals (B') can be obtained by a preparation process described below: 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide is dissolved in an organic solvent, a good solvent (for example, DMSO, dimethylimidazolidine, l-methyl-2- pyrrolidinone, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, acetic acid, sulfolane, etc.), and then thereto a poor solvent (for example, water, acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, or a mixture thereof, etc.) is admixed slowly (for example, for 1 hr. or longer). When the poor solvent is admixed slowly, crystals appeared, but when stirring is stopped, the resultant crystals spreads all over the solvent.<br>
	More specifically, for example, to 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide, a good solvent (DMSO or l-methyl-2- pyrrolidinone) in a volume from 4 to 5 times based on 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide is added, and then the mixture is heated to 80°C or higher while stirring to dissolve the solute. To this mixture, while heating at from 65 to 85°C and stirring, a poor solvent (isopropyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methanol, or isopropanol) in a volume from 10 to 20 times based on 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide is introduced over 30 min. or longer so that crystals can appear. Further, it is preferred to add the seed crystals when the poor solvent is introduced to allow the crystals to appear. The polymorphic crystals (B') can be obtained by stirring the resulting reaction mixture, in which the crystals appeared, while heating at 70°C or higher for 30 min. or longer, and further by stirring at room temperature to collect the crystals by filtration.<br>
[35]	The polymorphic crystals (B') can be obtained by another preparation process described below: 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide is dissolved while stirring in an organic solvent, a good solvent (for example, DMSO, dimethylimidazolidine, l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone,	N,N-dimethylformamide,	N,N- dimethylacetamide, acetic acid, sulfolane, etc.), and then a poor solvent (for example, water, acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, or a mixture thereof, etc.) is admixed so that when stirring is stopped, the resultant crystals spreads all over the solvent.<br>
[36]	The polymorphic crystals (B1) can be obtained by still another preparation process described below: 7-methoxy-4- chloroquinoline-6-carboxamide and 1 -(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3- cyclopropylurea are reacted in the presence of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide, cesium carbonate, potassium carbonate, etc.) in an organic solvent that works a good solvent for 4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide (for example, DMSO, dimethylimidazolidinone, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone,	N,N-dimethylformamide,	N,N- dimethylacetamide, sulfolane, etc.), and then thereto a poor solvent (for example, water, acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, or a mixture thereof, etc.) is admixed slowly (for example, for 30 min. or longer).<br>
[37]	More specifically, for example, to a mixture of l-(2- chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea, 7-methoxy-4-chloro- quinoline-6-carboxamide (one equivalent or more based on l-(2- chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea), and potassium t- butoxide (one equivalent or more based on l-(2-chloro-4- hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea), DMSO in a volume from 5 to 10 times based on l-(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea is<br>
added at room temperature, and then the mixture is heated to from 55 to 75°C while stirring for 20 hr. or longer to allow the reaction to proceed. To this reaction mixture, while heating at from 60 to 65°C and stirring, a poor solvent (33% acetone in water) in a volume 15 times based on l-(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-cyclopropylurea is introduced over 2 hr. or longer so that crystals can appear. The polymorphic crystals (B1) can be obtained by stirring the resulting reaction mixture, in which the crystals appeared, while heating at 40°C for 3 hr. or longer to collect the crystals by filtration.<br>
[38]	The polymorphic crystals (B') can be obtained by still another preparation process described below: the polymorphic crystals (A')	of	4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide having a diffraction peak at a diffraction angle (20 ± 0.2°) of 15.75° in a powder X-ray diffraction is suspended and heated in a mixed solution of an organic solvent which is a good solvent for the above polymorphic crystals and a poor solvent for the above polymorphic crystals. It is preferred that the polymorphic crystals (A1) used for this purpose also has diffraction peaks at diffraction angles (20 + 0.2°) of 9.98° and 11.01°.<br>
[39]	The polymorphic crystals (B1) can be obtained by still another preparation process described below: the polymorphic crystals (A1)	of	4-(3-chloro-4- (cyclopropylaminocarbonyl)aminophenoxy)-7-methoxy-6- quinolinecarboxamide having absorbance at a wavenumber of 3452.3 ± 2.5 cm'1 in an infrared absorption spectrum (potassium bromide) is suspended and heated in a mixed solution of a good solvent for the above polymorphic crystals and a poor solvent for the above polymorphic crystals. It is preferred that the polymorphic crystals (A1) used for this purpose has absorbance at a wavenumber of 3452.3 ± 2.5 cm'1 (and also at 1712.2 ±1.0 cm"1) in an infrared absorption spectrum (potassium bromide).<br>

[41]	The crystals of hydrochloride or hydrobromide can be obtained by mixing the carboxamide and a solvent to dissolve the carboxamide therein, to which hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid is then added. More specifically, for example, the carboxamide and the solvent are mixed to dissolve the carboxamide therein by heating, and then thereto hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid is added followed by gradually cooling the resulting mixture to room temperature so that the crystals of hydrochloride or hydrobromide can be prepared. As a solvent, an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol can be used, and ethanol is preferred. Further, water may be optionally added to the alcohol. There is no particular restriction on the amount of the solvent, but the solvent preferably from 10 to 30 times, more preferably 20 times, as much as the solute is used. As for the amount of hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, from 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents, preferably 1.1 equivalents, based on the solute can be used. There is no particular restriction on the heating temperature, but the heating temperature is preferably from 60°C to the reflux temperature, and more preferably the reflux temperature. For cooling, it may take from 10 min. to 24 hr. to cool down gradually from the heating temperature to room temperature.<br>
[42]	The crystals of a p-toluenesulfonate or sulfate can be obtained by mixing the carboxamide, a solvent, and p-toluenesulfonic acid or sulfuric acid to dissolve the carboxamide therein. More<br>

Then thereto a suitable amount of purified water was added followed by granulation, drying, and milling to give the granules. To these granules, 3 g of croscarmellose sodium (a disintegrant, trade name: Ac-Di-Sol, from FMC International Inc.) and 0.5 g of magnesium stearate (a lubricant) were admixed, and then tablets were formed by a tablet press to give tablets (the total mass per tablet was 400 mg) containing 10 mg of the medicament Y per tablet.<br>
[102]	Stability was tested for the tablets prepared in Example 1 and Comparative Example 1. In the test, after the tablets were stored at 5°C, at 25°C, and at 40°C and under relative humidity 75% RH, for 3 months each, impurity levels (%) were determined by HPLC. The results are shown in Table 3 below. As shown in Table 3, the tablets containing magnesium oxide (MgO) (Example 1) are superior in stability to the tablets containing no magnesium oxide (MgO) (Comparative Example 1). In particular, the stability under the humidified conditions was remarkably improved with the stabilizer. <br><br><br>
centrifuged to give the supernatant as a sample solution, which then was analyzed by HPLC. The results are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6 is a graph illustrating the amount of the decomposed product A generated when various kinds of stabilizers were added at various concentrations. The results demonstrate that sodium hydroxide provided the highest stabilizing effect, the decomposition of the medicament X being reduced by adding only 1% of sodium hydroxide. Further, the stabilizing effect of magnesium oxide was similar to that of sodium hydroxide, the decomposition of the medicament X being significantly reduced by adding only 1% of magnesium oxide. The stabilizing effect of magnesium oxide was almost constant by adding 3% or more thereof. [0108] [Inhibition of Gelation] (Example 2) 1 mg Tablets<br>

[115]	The storage test and the dissolution test were conducted for the tablets prepared above according to the methods described below.<br>
(Storage Test)<br>
Tablets in a glass bottle with the cap open were stored at 5°C, at 60°C and 75% RH, at 40°C and 75% RH, or at 30°C and 65% RH. (Dissolution test)<br>
The dissolution test was conducted according to the Japanese Pharmacopoeia 14th Edition and by the paddle method under the conditions described below. The test solution: 900 mL of 0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid. The rotation speeds: 50 rpm. The temperature of the test solution: 37°C.<br>
[116]	(Experimental Example 1)<br>
The storage test (the storage duration was 3 months) was conducted for the tablets prepared in Examples 2 and 3. No delayed dissolution was found for the tablets of both Examples at any of the conditions at 5°C, at 30°C and 65% RH, and at 40°C and 75% RH. The results of each of the examples are shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
[117]	(Experimental Example 2)<br>
The tablets prepared in Example 4 and Comparative Example 2 were stored at 60°C and 75% RH for 7 days. The tablets then underwent the dissolution test. The results are shown in Figure 4. For the tablets of Comparative Example 2, the gelation of the tablet surface was noted even at the beginning of the test. Further, significant delayed dissolution was observed after the storage test. On the other hand, for the tablets of Example 4, the gelation on the surface was not noted on any of the tablets. The inhibition of delayed dissolution after the storage was also observed.<br>
	(Experimental Example 3)<br>
The tablets prepared in Examples 5 to 7 were stored at 60°C and 75% RH for 7 days. The tablets then underwent the dissolution test. To confirm the influence of the amount of light anhydrous silicic acid contained in the tablet, the drug released (%) 30 min. after the dissolution test started was compared. The results are shown in Figure 5. When from 16 to 32 mg of light anhydrous silicic acid was contained per 100 mg of the medicament Y, delayed dissolution seen in Comparative Example 2 was not observed. In particular, for the tablets of Example 5, wherein 32 mg of light anhydrous silicic acid was contained, delayed dissolution was barely seen after the storage as well.<br>
[119]	The results shown above demonstrate that the addition of from 4 to 8% of the gelation inhibitor provides the pharmaceutical composition comprising the medicament X with great dissolution properties, while the gelation was effectively inhibited. Next examined were disintegration properties when higher levels of the gelation inhibitor was contained in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegration properties when the stabilizer and the gelation inhibitor were contained therein were also examined. Disintegration properties were further examined, when silicone dioxide hydrate or calcium silicate was used in place of light anhydrous silicic acid as a gelation inhibitor.<br>
