				<td>METHOD FOR PROCESSING IRON-LADEN SPENT SULFURIC ACID<br>
The invention concerns a method for processing spent<br>
sulfuric acid that contains heavy metals.<br>
Heavy metal-laden spent sulfuric acids are formed<br>
during the production of titanium dioxide using the<br>
sulfate process. Thus, the dilute acid remaining after<br>
filtering out the titanium oxide hydrate contains heavy<br>
metals like iron, which make utilization or disposal<br>
difficult.<br>
For this reason, there has been no lack of attempts to<br>
process the dilute acid or to dispose of it, in an<br>
ecologically safe way. For instance, EP 132820 describes<br>
the possibility of evaporating the dilute acid, optionally<br>
extracting metal sulfates and reacting the remaining metal<br>
sulfates with CaO, Ca(OH)2 and/or CaCO3 to form gypsum and<br>
sparingly soluble metal compounds. However, this method is<br>
not very economical, in particular because of the energy-<br>
needed to concentrate the dilute acid. Correspondingly,<br>
the processing of other spent sulfuric acids that contain<br>
heavy metals is generally also costly and uneconomical.<br>
Against this background, the problem underlying the<br>
invention is to provide a method, which is improved from<br>
the environmental and cost standpoints, for disposal or<br>
utilization of iron-laden spent sulfuric acid.<br>
This problem is solved in accordance with the<br>
invention by a method in which the iron-laden spent<br>
sulfuric acid or iron-containing processing products<br>
obtained therefrom are reacted with a material that<br>
contains iron chlorides and optionally other metal<br>
chlorides, whereby iron(II) sulfate is obtained. HCl is<br>
preferably obtained in addition in this way, and this can<br><br>
be separated and reused in gaseous form and/or as aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
The concentration of the spent sulfuric acid is not<br>
particularly restricted and generally amounts to 10 to<br>
90%. Therefore, dilute acid with an H2SO4 concentration of<br>
20 to 30% can be used directly. Or use can be made of<br>
washing acids or process acids that contain dilute acid<br>
and that have a low concentration of H2SO4. Prior to the<br>
reaction, however, the acid can be concentrated, e.g., to<br>
a concentration of 50-70%, or even 70-90%. In addition to<br>
iron ions, the spent sulfuric acid can contain other metal<br>
ions such as manganese or titanium. The content of iron<br>
ions preferably amounts to 2 to 22 wt%.<br>
It is also possible to utilize products that are<br>
obtained from spent sulfuric acid, e.g.:<br>
-	spent sulfuric acid, which has been concentrated,<br>
containing suspended crystalline iron sulfate;<br>
-	solids that contain iron sulfate (e.g. a filter<br>
cake in the form in which it is generated during<br>
the separation of metal sulfates, which contain<br>
iron sulfate, from solutions that contain sulfuric<br>
acid) together with sulfuric acid adhering thereto<br>
(filter salts).<br>
These products, which are obtained from spent<br>
sulfuric acid, can also be used in any desired<br>
combination with spent sulfuric acid that contains iron<br>
sulfate.<br>
The spent sulfuric acid used in accordance with the<br>
invention or the material obtained that is obtained<br>
therefrom preferably derives from titanium dioxide<br>
production using the sulfate process, from the smelting of<br>
copper, lead or zinc, or it is generated as a byproduct of<br><br>
an organic synthesis process, or is a pickling solution<br>
resulting from the pickling of steel with sulfuric acid.<br>
The material which is reacted with the sulfuric acid<br>
also contain other additional metal chlorides, such as<br>
those of chromium, vanadium, niobium, and zirconium, along<br>
with iron chloride. The material can be present in the<br>
form of a solid, a suspension, or a solution in<br>
hydrochloric acid, and preferably as a solution in<br>
hydrochloric acid. The material preferably contains iron<br>
chloride in a quantity of 10-30 wt%. However, the iron<br>
chloride can also be present in a quantity of 30-60 wt% in<br>
the case where solids, slurries, or suspensions are<br>
present. The respective materials are formed, for example,<br>
in the processing of pickling solutions or as residues in<br>
the manufacture of titanium dioxide by the chloride<br>
process. Generally, the material does not derive from the<br>
same process as the spent sulfuric acid.<br>
Hydrochloric acid pickling solutions, which are<br>
generated, for instance, during the pickling of steel,<br>
generally contain 14 to 25% iron(II) chloride, 3 to 7% HCl<br>
and various contaminants that derive from the pickled<br>
steel. Various processes are known in which these pickling<br>
solutions or their processing products are reacted with<br>
sulfuric acid to obtain iron sulfate and to recycle the<br>
pickling solution. For instance, US 4,222,997 describes a<br>
process in which the pickling solution is concentrated at<br>
first and then reacted with concentrated (95 to 98%)<br>
sulfuric acid. According to US 4,382,916, the pickling<br>
solution is concentrated until iron(II) chloride<br>
precipitates, which is then reacted with sulfuric acid to<br>
form iron (II) sulfate monohydrate. DE 41 22 92 0 Al and WO<br>
01/49901 Al describe methods in which a pickling solution<br>
is reacted with sulfuric acid to form iron(II) sulfate<br>
heptahydrate. The reaction conditions described in these<br>
documents for the reaction of sulfuric acid with the<br><br>
pickling solution can also be employed in accordance with<br>
the present invention when using spent sulfuric acid from<br>
the titanium dioxide production. However, since these<br>
methods are generally carried out with pure concentrated<br>
sulfuric acid that has a concentration of more than 90%,<br>
while in accordance with the present invention the spent<br>
sulfuric acid has a concentration that is generally less<br>
than 90% and. frequently only 20 to 3 0% and it also<br>
contains iron and other metal ions, the concentration of<br>
the iron chloride-containing material is appropriately<br>
adjusted. When dilute acid is used, the reaction with a<br>
solid iron chloride-containing material or iron chloride-<br>
containing suspensions or highly concentrated iron<br>
chloride-containing solutions is preferred, while<br>
concentrated dilute acids or filter salts are preferably<br>
reacted with less concentrated FeCl2 solutions.<br>
Initially, iron(II) chloride and other metal chlorides<br>
can be separated as solids from the pickling solution by<br>
concentrating the pickling solution. The solid matter is<br>
then dissolved in the spent sulfuric acid at elevated<br>
temperature, and then iron(II) sulfate is precipitated by<br>
reducing the temperature. Alternatively, the pickling<br>
solution can be reacted directly with the spent sulfuric<br>
acid. Then, iron(II) sulfate is precipitated by reducing<br>
the temperature. As a result of a suitable selection of<br>
the parameters, a situation can be achieved in which the<br>
iron sulfate crystallizes out essentially in the form of<br>
iron sulfate heptahydrate. However, the reaction conditions<br>
can also be configured in such a way that predominantly iron<br>
sulfate monohydrate crystallizes out. The selection of the<br>
parameters naturally depends on the requirements of the iron<br>
sulfate in regard to its further usage. High temperatures<br>
during the reaction and high concentrations of sulfuric acid<br>
favor the crystallization of iron sulfate monohydrate, while<br>
low temperatures during the reaction and low concentrations<br><br>
of sulfuric acid favor the crystallization of iron sulfate<br>
heptahydrate.<br>
The process of crystallizing the iron sulfate<br>
heptahydrate is generally preferred since, as a result of the<br>
high quantity of water of crystallization, concentrating the<br>
solution is required only to a minor extent, or such<br>
concentrating can even be omitted completely.<br>
With the appropriate control of the temperature in<br>
the reactor to a maximum of 50°C, preferably 30 to 45°C,<br>
the iron (II) sulfate precipitates in the form of the<br>
heptahydrate, which is particularly preferred. Parameters<br>
can be selected such that the other metal sulfates, which<br>
can originate both from the spent sulfuric acid and from<br>
the pickling solution, do not achieve their solubility-<br>
product under the reaction conditions and remain in<br>
solution (in this way, the iron(II) sulf ate is obtained in<br>
high purity) ; or the parameters can be selected such that<br>
the other metal sulfates essentially crystallize out<br>
together with the iron sulfate. The selection of<br>
parameters naturally depends on the purity requirements<br>
for the iron sulfate with regard to its further use.<br>
If a supernatant that contains other metals is<br>
obtained, it can be disposed of in a known way. For<br>
example, the metals can be precipitated in the form of<br>
their hydroxides and then dried. The pH value is<br>
preferably increased in steps in this connection, whereby<br>
this is done in order to permit selective precipitation.<br>
This preparation of iron (II) sulfate from spent<br>
sulfuric acid and a pickling solution is particularly<br>
economical compared to the production of iron(II) sulfate<br>
from pure sulfuric acid, since (i) the spent sulfuric<br>
acid is economically more favorable, (ii) its use does<br>
not give rise to any additional costs in spite of the<br><br>
presence of heavy metals, since further processing is<br>
necessary even when using pure sulfuric acid because of<br>
the contaminants in the pickling solution, and (iii) its<br>
use increases the production of iron(II) sulfate because<br>
of its iron content, and the process of crystallization<br>
of iron sulfate is promoted by the increased<br>
concentration. Thus, in the treatment of pickling<br>
solutions, the spent sulfuric acid can replace the pure<br>
sulfuric acid essentially without a loss of quality and<br>
it moreover has additional advantages if a utilization of<br>
the iron sulfate is desired. Thereby, not only an<br>
economical, but also an ecologically compatible<br>
utilization of the iron-containing spent sulfuric acid,<br>
as is obtained, for example, from titanium oxide<br>
production using the sulfate process, or of a sulfuric<br>
acid pickling solution are ensured. Moreover, it is<br>
possible to reduce the acidity of the iron chloride-<br>
containing material and/or the iron sulfate-containing<br>
material before or after the reaction with the other<br>
material through the addition of metallic iron or iron<br>
oxides or a mixture of both and at the same time to<br>
increase the concentration of iron.<br>
A large number of degrees of freedom exist in the<br>
selection of a suitable concentration for the reaction of<br>
the iron chloride-containing material with the iron<br>
sulfate-containing material which is to be as efficie nt as<br>
possible, and the crystallization and separation of the<br>
iron sulfate that are to be as efficient as possible; thus<br>
when using iron-containing sulfuric acid of low<br>
concentration (e.g., dilute acid from the production of<br>
titanium dioxide), reaction with the solid metal chlorides<br>
in a highly concentrated suspension of metal chlorides in<br>
aqueous solution can be particularly advantageous. When<br>
using highly concentrated sulfuric acid (e.g., from gas<br>
purification procedures, or concentrated dilute acid from<br>
the production of titanium dioxide, or of metal sulfates<br><br>
in the form in which these are generated during the<br>
concentration of dilute acid from the production of<br>
titanium dioxide that can contain sulfuric acid that is<br>
still adhering thereto or of crystalline iron-containing<br>
metal sulfates that are suspended in sulfuric acid) ,<br>
conversely, reaction with a solution of metal chlorides of<br>
low concentration can be particularly advantageous. These<br>
degrees of freedom - in addition to temperature and<br>
pressure - can also be utilised in order to crystallize<br>
iron sulfate monohydrate or iron sulfate heptahydrate in a<br>
controlled manner.<br>
Another material that can be used for the reaction<br>
with the spent sulfuric acid are the metal chloride<br>
residues that ax-e generated in the titanium dioxide<br>
production using the chloride process. Processing of these<br>
residues is particularly costly because of their heavy<br>
metal content and is described inter alia in EP 3 90 293 A1<br>
and DE 42 43 559 A1. After separating them from the stream<br>
of titanium tetrachloride - generally by means of a<br>
cyclone that is serially connected downstream of the<br>
fluidized-bed reactor - a mixture of solids is obtained<br>
which is also designated cyclone dust and which comprises<br>
unconsumed titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, coke,<br>
iron(II) chloride, as well as other chlorides. By<br>
dissolving the cyclone dust in dilute hydrochloric acid<br>
and separating the water-insoluble components or by<br>
leaching with hydrochloric acid a solution is obtained<br>
that predominantly contains iron(II) chloride, but also<br>
aluminum chloride, manganese chloride, magnesium chloride,<br>
zirconium chloride and trace elements of chromium, niobium<br>
and vanadium in the form of their chlorides. The iron ion<br>
content preferably amounts to 10 to 30 wt%.<br>
Optionally after separating the insoluble<br>
components, this iron(II) chloride-containing material<br>
is then reacted with the spent sulfuric acid, for<br><br>
example, a spent sulfuric acid from the titanium dioxide<br>
production using the sulfate process, whereby the<br>
temperature control is selected such that iron(II)<br>
sulfate precipitates. With an appropriate control of the<br>
temperature in the reactor to a maximum of 50°C,<br>
preferably 30 to 45°C, the iron(II) sulfate precipitates<br>
in the form of the heptahydrate, which is particularly<br>
preferred. Since the other metal sulfates, which<br>
originate from both the spent sulfuric acid and the<br>
metal chloride waste solution, generally do not reach<br>
their solubility product under the reaction conditions,<br>
they remain in solution. Thus, the iron(II) sulfate is<br>
obtained in good purity.<br>
If a supernatant is obtained, which contains the<br>
other metals, this can be disposed of in a known manner.<br>
For example, the metals can be precipitated in the form<br>
of their hydroxides, and then dried. The pH value is<br>
preferably increased in steps in this connection,<br>
whereby this is done in order to permit selective<br>
precipitation. Reaction with Ca compounds is<br>
particularly preferable, whereby only those fractions<br>
remain behind that have a low solubility in water, and<br>
this is in contrast to the neutralization of the metal<br>
chlorides with Ca compounds.<br>
This manufacture of iron(II) sulfate from spent<br>
sulfuric acid and a metal chloride waste solution from the<br>
production of titanium dioxide, using the chloride<br>
process, represents a particularly economical utilization<br>
of these waste products, especially in titanium dioxide<br>
plants in which titanium dioxide is manufactured using<br>
both the sulfate process and the chloride process, or in<br>
pickling plants in which pickling is conducted using both<br>
sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, and thus the two<br>
waste products each are generated in the same plant. The<br>
extraordinary significance of the solution in accordance<br><br>
with the present invention results in particular from the<br>
fact that up to now, many industrially costly and<br>
expensive or ecologically questionable disposal processes<br>
have been practiced on an industrial scale for both waste<br>
products, namely the iron-containing spent sulfuric acid<br>
and the iron-containing metal chloride residues, which<br>
become obsolete when using the method according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
100 mL (= 133.4 g) of an FeCl2 solution with the<br>
following composition<br><br>
were mixed with 112.8 g of a sulfate sludge (containing<br>
about 12 0 % of the stoichiometrically required amount of<br>
sulfuric acid) in the form generated during the<br>
concentrating of dilute acid from titanium dioxide<br>
production using the sulfate process. The sulfate sludge<br>
comprises crystalline metal sulfates suspended in<br>
sulfuric acid; its iron content is typically about 4 to<br>
10 wt% (as Fe).<br>
After subsequent separation of the resulting<br>
hydrochloric acid by distillation at 103 to 107°C, about<br>
118.6 g of a residue were obtained which were comprised<br>
of predominantly iron sulfate and approximately 0.1 wt%<br>
chloride.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
100 mL (= 133.4 g) of an FeCl2 solution with the<br>

were mixed with 96 g of a sulfate sludge (containing about<br>
the stoichiometrically necessary amount of sulfuric acid)<br>
in the form generated during the concentrating of dilute<br>
acid from titanium dioxide production using the sulfate<br>
process. The sulfate sludge comprises crystalline metal<br>
sulfate suspended in sulfuric acid; its iron content is<br>
typically about 4 to 10 wt% (as Fe) .<br>
After subsequent separation of the resulting<br>
hydrochloric acid by distillation at 103 to 107°C about<br>
104.7 g of a residue were obtained which were comprised of<br>
predominantly iron sulfate and approximately 0.3 wt%<br>
chloride.<br>
Example 3:<br>
88.4 g of a mixture of metal chlorides with insoluble<br>
residues from the titanium dioxide production using.the<br>
chloride process with the composition<br><br><br><br>
were mixed with 102.9 g of a sulfate sludge (containing<br>
about 12 0% of the stoichiometrically required amount of<br>
sulfuric acid) , in the form generated during the<br>
concentrating of dilute acid from titanium dioxide<br>
production using the sulfate process. The sulfate sludge<br>
comprises crystalline metal sulfates suspended in sulfuric<br>
acid; its iron content is typically about 4 to 10 wt% (as<br>
Fe) .<br>
After subsequent separation of the resulting<br>
hydrochloric acid by distillation at 103 to 107°C (80 min<br>
at an oil bath temperature of 180°C) about 127.1 g of a<br>
residue were obtained which were comprised of<br>
predominantly iron sulfate and approximately 0.4 wt%<br>
chloride.<br><br>
