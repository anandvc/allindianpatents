Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates a novel cleaning composition. More particularly the invention pertains to a novel cleaning composition for cleaning metal parts. This cleaning composition finds extensive application in the industry.<br>
Background Art<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of surfaces of metal parts for operations such as plating, painting, rust-proofing. Metal parts, during the course of manufacture, become coated with cutting oils, drawing and buffing compounds, lapping compounds, other mineral oils, dust carbon smut, chips and other materials which must be removed before inspection.<br>
It is to be noted that requirements preferred by the industry as regards to cleaning composition are as follows.<br>
a)	To perform the cleaning at ambient temperatures, to save energy.<br>
b)	The formulation should be user friendly.<br>
c)	The formulation should preferably be without a flash point. In other words it should not be inflammable.<br>
d)	The Formulations should preferably not create any environmental/effluent problem.<br>
e)	After removal of the soils, the formulations should preferably provide a surface, which will resist oxidation/corrosion in the interval between operations and in some instances a storage interval.<br>
f)	The formulation should provide a chemically clean surface after removal of the soils.<br>
g)	The bath in which the formulation is used should have a long life for reasons of economy.<br>
h)        The bath should be easy to control by the operator.<br><br>
The following description traces various cleaning composition known in the art and the deficiencies of the said known cleaning composition.<br>
It is to be further noted that important methods of metal cleaning are as follows.<br>
1)	Treatment with liquid solvent by spraying, dipping or hand-scrubbing. Steel parts cleaned in this way tend to rust rapidly and the surfaces are not chemically clean.<br>
2)	Vapour degreasing involves condensation of solvent vapours upon the surface of the metal. The condensed solvent drips back into the bath. The drawbacks mentioned in (1) above apply to this method also. In addition solid soil is often left back as a residue on the metal, which must be hand-wiped.<br>
3)	Alkali solution cleaning - This involves soaking of metal parts in an alkali bath with or without water soluble detergents. Spray machines may also be used. For rapid cleaning high pH values are used and high temperatures are very necessary, as the efficiency of an alkaline bath at room temperature for industrial cleaning, is practically zero. This leads to hazards to operating personnel and to danger of metal surfaces being attacked. Contamination builds up rapidly in the bath, resulting in re-deposition of the soil. Lastly it is difficult to remove last traces of alkali from metal surfaces, as they rinse very poorly, and this can increase susceptibility to corrosion.<br>
4)	Emulsion Cleaning - where the metal is treated with a soap or other emulsifying agents in an organic solvent. The emulsifying agents may aid in loosening the soil and to disperse or solubilise the soil. The metal parts are then rinsed with water and generally a pressure stream is used. High temperatures are involved. The efficiency of the process is very poor on account of poor de-wetting, rinsability, other hazards mentioned in (3) above apply.<br><br>
5)	Mechanical abrasion - which follows generally after removal of oil and grease.<br>
6)	Electrocleaning - The metal is made the anode or cathode in an electrolytic bath, or the polarity is periodically reversed.<br>
7)	Pickling - Acid treatment to remove surface oxide films, after removal of oil and grease.<br>
Deficiency of General Methods of Cleaning<br>
The general methods of the cleaning given above do not meet industrial requirements, and the need arose therefore, of developing a new formulation to address the needs the needs of the industry.<br>
The primary object of the invention is to develop a new cleaning composition to meet the requirement of industry.<br>
It is another object of the invention to develop a new cleaning composition which is unique.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following description.<br>
The invention will be clearly and particularly described in the following complete specification. The nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed will be clearly described in the complete specification.<br>
Development of a new Formulation to meet Industrial Needs<br>
A novel formulation, has been developed which meets all the above requirements of the industry.<br><br>
Summary of Invention<br>
A cleaning composition consist of the following of ingredient in the proportion mentioned herein.<br>
Ingredient	Proportion<br>
a.	Terpene	10%-20%<br>
b.	Solvent	75% - 80%<br>
c.	Coupling Agent	2%   - 5%<br>
d.	Anionic group	8%   -10%<br>
Method of Cleaning using this novel cleaning composition<br>
The articles to be cleaned are simply immersed in this novel cleaning composition solution at ambient for a few minutes. Spraying, agitation by circulation of novel cleaning composition, dunking, are essential for effective cleaning. Best results, however, for smaller components, are obtained with ultrasonic cleaning. Approximately three minutes in an ultrasonic bath are required for cleaning the metal of stubborn soils. When the novel cleaning composition is used in an ultrasonic machine, it is able to penetrate even recesses and blind holes.<br>
Results and Advantages of Cleaning with the novel cleaning composition<br>
All the above mentioned soils, including lapping compounds are removed. A very fine rust prevention film of molecular thickness is deposited on the surface of the metal. This film does not interfere with paint adherence and in fact seems to enhance it. Nor does the film interfere with subsequent plating operations.<br>
The operator needs only to control the level of the bath which gets depleted due to handling losses, particularly when the sludge formed is cleaned periodically.<br>
The bath of this novel cleaning composition is a No Dump Bath by which it is meant that the bath is only to be made up for handling losses, and there is not effluent problem.<br><br>
The Formulations of this cleaning composition<br>
We have found that a particular mixture of Terepene derivatives which include ethers esters alcohol, Hydrocarbons along with.<br>
a.	A non ionic blending / coupling agent of the polyether type<br>
b.	An anionic soap<br>
c.	A refined mineral oil with flash point above 75°C<br>
and other minor additives, will clean a metal surface completely of the soils mentioned above at ambient temperatures, as well as provide temporary corrosion prevention.<br>
The quantity of terpene products as well as the quantity of mineral oil will normally total to 90% of the finished formulation, with the other ingredients forming the balance 10%, giving a ratio of 1:9. This ratio can be varied upto 1:30, depending on industrial needs. (Ratios are by weight) The resulting formulation when tested does not show any flash point and is therefore safe to use.<br>
Salient Features of Invention:<br>
The formulation of a new type of cleaning composition, for cleaning metal parts comprising of terpene ethers, their methyl esters, terpene hydrocarbons, a mineral oil of flash point above 75°C, a coupling or blending agent consisting of a non ionic ether and a anionic soap mixed in various proportions as defined in the complete specification, is to arrive at a balance so that.<br>
a.	the  resulting mixture can be  used to  clean metals  of miscellaneous  soils<br>
mentioned above at ambient temperatures.<br>
b.	the resulting mixture has nil flash point and is safe to use.<br>
c.	the resulting mixture will provide, after the metals are cleaned in the mixture, a<br>
temporary corrosion preventive film.<br><br>
d.	the resulting mixture constitutes what is known has a No Dumps Bath by which it<br>
is meant that the bath has only to be made up of handling losses resulting from<br>
periodic removal of sludge and filtration, and there is no effluent problem<br>
involved.<br>
e.	the resulting bath does not require any operational control except maintaining the<br>
level.<br>
f.	the resulting formulation has a Rideal Walker co-efficient greater than one,<br>
indicating that the formulation is a mild disinfectant.<br>
g.	the resulting formulation is very soft on the user's hands and can remove grease,<br>
oil, lapping compounds from the hands without use of water.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></td>
