SELF-ALIGNING HITCH<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention pertains to hitches, and more particularly to self-aligning hitches for coupling two imprecisely aligned vehicles, for example, a towing vehicle and a trailer vehicle.<br>
Background<br>
Hitches are in wide use for towing many kinds of trailer vehicles by towing vehicles. Most traditional hitches comprise the combination of a first coupling means (for example, a ball) attached to one of the vehicles and a second coupling means (for example, a hollow, hemispherical coupler) attached to the other. Since such conventional coupling means are fixedly attached to the vehicles, it is necessary for the vehicles to be brought into precise alignment in order to achieve coupling. This can be a difficult and time-consuming task. In circumstances where precise alignment is not achieved, it may be possible to manually move the trailer vehicle to a position for coupling to the towing vehicle. While this may be acceptable for lightweight trailer vehicles, it is a near-impossible task for heavier trailer vehicles such as loaded airport freight carts. Persons attempting to manually position a heavy trailer vehicle may suffer injuries.<br>
Further, it is desirable to prevent the need for a secondperson to assist in coupling the towing and trailer vehicles. In general, having a second person, located behind the towing vehicle, to direct the operator of the towing vehicle presents dangerous circumstances. Further, it is inefficient to require two people to achieve a result which could be accomplished by a single person.<br>
In general, the prior art has attempted to address these problems with theprovision of a hitch assembly comprising atongue or rod which is slidably insertable into a housing mounted on one of the vehicles and which is capable of some longitudinal and lateral movement so that a rearward end of the tongue, fitted with a coupling means, can be manually positioned to engage the corresponding coupling means on the other vehicle. The hitch assemblies of some prior art references provide an automatic locking mechanism which locks the tongue into a "locked" position.<br>
However, the prior art hitch assemblies may suffer from one or more disadvantages. For example, several prior art hitch assemblies have been designed in such a way that it is only possible for the tongue to move to the "locked" position after the tongue becomes aligned with the vehicles. As a result, after the vehicles are coupled and the. towing vehicle is moved forward from a slightly displaced lateral position (relative to the trailer vehicle), the tongue may be susceptible to banging from side to side within the housing until liie tongue and the two vehicles achieve precise alignment This is disadvantageous since it: (1) may damage the sides of the housing, ultimately requiring repair or replacement; and (2) may place undue pressure on the pivot pin retaining the proximal end of 1he tongue within the housing. After a period of time, the pin may become damaged to the point where repair or replacement is necessary.<br><br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CAO1/01000<br>
Along the same lines, several prior art hitch assemblies are designed in such a way that lateral movement of the tongue is not immediately possible after the locking mechanism is disengaged. Rather, the operator is required to withdraw the tongue entirely, or nearly so, from within the housing until lateral movement of the tongue is possible. This limits the use of the hitch assembly. In some circumstances, the operator may have backed the towing vehicle into close proximity to the trailer vehicle so that the tongue cannot be fully withdrawn since it will engage the front portion of the trailer vehicle. Since lateral movement is then not possible (since the tongue is not capable of being fully extended from the housing), the operator would be forced to get back into the towing vehicle and move it ahead to create sufficient space between the vehicles to enable foil extension of the tongue, and thus, lateral movement of the tongue. This adds unnecessary time and effort into the process, and could be eliminated if one could laterally position the tongue immediately upon disengagement of the locking mechanism.<br>
Prior art hitch assemblies which may suffer from one or both of the above-noted disadvantages are described in: U.S. Patent No. 3,912,119, issued to Hill et al., U.S. Patent No. 2,871,029, issued to Demarest, U.S. Patent No. 3,860,267, issued to Lyons and U.S. Patent No. 4,991,865, issued to Francisco.<br>
The hitch assemblies described in Demarest, Hill et al., and Francisco may be susceptible to damage to the housing while the tongue is moving into the housing and towards its locked position from either side-to-side banging of the tongue therein, or from the longitudinal engagement of a proximal end of the tongue on a closed interior of the housing.<br>
Other prior art hitch assemblies include overly complex mechanisms which may render the hitch assembly too expensive for commercial application or too cumbersome for retrofitting existing towing vehicles. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,558,883, issued to Bouma, discloses such a complicated hitch mechanism.<br>
Some prior art hitch assemblies, such as the one disclosed in U.S. patent No. 5,277,447, issued to Blaser, disclose housing and tongue designs which allow limited lateral movement of the tongue. This may be disadvantageous if the towing vehicle is sufficiently misaligned relative to the trailer vehicle to be outside the lateral movement range of the tongue. Repeated positioning of the towing vehicle relative to the trailer vehicle would be required to overcome such a limitation.<br>

Description<br>
The hitch of the present invention allows the coupling of a towing vehicle to a trailer vehicle and is particularly suited for situations where there is imprecise alignment of the coupling means of the two vehicles. As used herein, the term "towing vehicle" encompasses any vehicle for pulling, towing or otherwise drawing a subsequent vehicle, referred to as a "trailer vehicle", coupled therewith. For example, a towing vehicle could be a truck, an RV, a car or a tractor vehicle used at airports for pulling freight (i.e. luggage, etc.) carts. The term "trailer vehicle", on the other hand, encompasses any vehicle which is designed to be pulled, towed or otherwise drawn by a towing vehicle. For example, a towing vehicle could be a boat trailer, an airport freight cart or an airport pallet or container cart. As will be explained later, "towing vehicle" also encompasses a first trailer vehicle which is used to tow a second trailer vehicle in a multiple trailer vehicle train.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a hitch 10, which includes a tongue housing 12 and a tongue 14. Tongue housing 12 is adapted for attachment to a rear end of a towing vehicle, such as, for example, a tractor for pulling freight carts at airports.<br>
Turning to Figure 4 in conjunction with Figure 1, tongue housing 12 includes a top wall 16 and a bottom wall 18, which are in a substantially parallel relationship and which are spaced apart by a distance at least as great as the thickness of tongue 14. Spaced apart side walls 20,22 are disposed between top wall 16 and bottom wall 18. Together, top wall 16, bottom wall 18 and side walls 20,22 form athroat 23. Side walls 20 and 22 are spaced apart such a distance that throat 23 has a width greater than the width of tongue 14, thus allowing for lateral articulation of tongue 14. Referring to Figures 4,7 and 8, side walls 20,22 have rounded central portions 20a and 22a (illustrated in dotted outline in Figure 8) so that throat 23 is generally hourglass shaped. A vertical wall 24 substantially encloses housing 12 at its forward end 12a. Vertical wall 24 abuts<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CA01/01000<br>
the forward ends of each of top wall 16, bottom wall 18 and side walls 20,22. Vertical wall 24 has a horizontal slot 26 defined therein, which permits the slidable extension and retraction of tongue 14 within tongue housing 12. Figure 5 illustrates the width, of slot 26 between central rounded portions 20a and 22a of side walls 20 and 22. It will be appreciated that slot 26 widens at the forward opening of throat 23, as with the illustrated rear opening of throat 23 in Figure 4.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, vertical wall 24 may conveniently be welded or fastened (such as by bolting) to a vertical surface 25 on the rear end of a towing vehicle 27 to attach tongue housing 12, and ultimately hitch 10, to towing vehicle 27. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the attachment of hitch 10 via vertical walls 24 and 25 is optional and tongue housing 12 could alternatively be attached to towing vehicle 27 in any suitable manner, such as for example, by welding or fastening bottom wall 18 to a horizontal skirt 29 of a standard vehicle commercial bumper. Hitch 10 can thus be easily retrofitted to existing towing vehicles.<br>
For proper operation of hitch 10, housing 12 must be attached to towing vehicle 27 so that tongue 14 is capable of extension and retraction without engaging rear wall 25. This may require, for example, attaching hitch 10 so that slot 26 is slightly below the lower-most edge of the rear end of rear wall 25. Alternatively, a slot (not shown) could be cut from a rear wall 25 of the towing vehicle at a location aligned with slot 26 to accommodate the insertion of tongue 14 therethrough.<br>
Turning to Figure 3, tongue 14 has a first end 28, and a second end 30. Tongue 14 is extendable, retractable and capable of lateral articulation within throat 23. As used herein, the term "extendable" refers to the movement of extending second end 30 of tongue 14 away from tongue housing 12. For example, tongue 14 is illustrated in anextended position in Figure 2 relative to the position shown in Figure 1. The term "retractable", on the other hand, refers to the movement of retracting second end 30 of tongue 14 from an extended position towards tongue housing 12. Figure 1 illustrates tongue 14 in its fully retracted position.<br>
Tongue 14 includes a trunnion 32, in a location proximal to first end 28. Trunnion 32 extends vertically above and below (see Figure 7 for an illustration of the extension of trunnion 32 below tongue 14) tongue 14 and has a height greater than the height of slot 26. Trunnion 32 is thus able to retain first end 28 from being fully removed from housing 12 upon extension of tongue 14 (see Figure 7), and simultaneously permits second end 30 to articulate laterally, relative to first end 28, when tongue 14 is fully extended, so as to allow hitch 10 to couple towing vehicle 27 to an imprecisely aligned trailer vehicle (not shown).<br>
Tongue 14 has a clevis 36 at its second end 30 for coupling to a cooperating coupler (not shown) operatively secured to the trailer vehicle (not shown). Clevis 36 has a lower arm 38, an upper arm 40, supported by vertical arm support wall 42, and a hitch pin 44. As illustrated in Figure 6, hitch pin 44 is insertable through an aperture 46 in upper arm 40 and partially insertable into aperture 48 in lower arm 38. Clevis 36 further includes a release member<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CA01/01000<br>
92, having its upper end 92a extending through aperture 93 above an upper surface 40a of upper arm 40, and its lower end 92b in contact with pin engaging member 94. End 92b is shaped to a size larger than aperture 93 so that release member 92 cannot be upwardly withdrawn from upper arm 40 ithrough aperture 93. pin engaging member 94 has a first end 94a and a second end 94b. First end 94a is in contact with spring 96 and release member 92. Pin engaging member 94 is disposed ui shelves 98 and 100 within upper arm 40. Pin engaging member 94 has an aperture 99 intermediate to ends 94a and 94b to accommodate the insertion of hitch pin 44 therethrough. End 94b of pin engaging member 94 rests within shelf 100. A lower end of spring 96 is mounted into sunken portion 98a of shelf 98.<br>
In operation, bitch pin 44 is normally in a raised position, illustrated in Figure 1, so that it is possible to position a corresponding ring (not shown) of a trailer vehicle (not shown) within d evis 3 6 (between arms 3 8 and 40) so that coupling can occur with the downward insertion of hitch pin 44 through the ring. Hitch pin 44 is maintained in its raised position by pin engaging member 94. Specifically, when pin engaging member 94 is in an angled position, as illustrated in Figure 6, there is frictional engagement between an inside edge of pin engaging member 94 (surrounding aperture 99) with the shaft of hitch pin 44 so that hitch pin 44 is maintained in its raised .position. Grooves 102 assist in this frictional engagement. When a ring (not shown) is positioned in the clevis between arms 3 8 and 40, an operator can readily insert hitch pin 44 through the ring (not shown) by applying a downward force on hitch pin 44. This downward force will cause pin engaging member 94 to move to a substantially horizontal position, against the bias of spring 96, so that the shaft of hitch pin 44 frictionally disengages pin engaging member 94, allowing free vertical movement of hitch pin 44. Once hitch pin 44 is inserted downwardly through the ring (not shown) and the downward force ceases, the bias of spring 96 causes pin engaging member 94 to return to its angled position of Figure 6, again frictionally engaging hitch pin 44 to maintain it in the lowered position. This prevents hitch pin 44 from inadvertently lifting so as to de-couple the trailer vehicle's coupling ring (not shown). Again, grooves 102assistinthefrictional engagement. "When de-coupling is desired, the operator applies a downward force to the upper end 92a of release member 92 causing end 94a of pin engaging member 94 to move downwardly so that pin engaging member 94 moves to a substantially horizontal position so that the internal edge of pin engaging member 94 (surrounding aperture 99) frictionally disengages hitch pin 44, allowing vertical upward movement of hitch pin 44 for de-coupling.<br>
Clevis 3 6 thus allows for the easy and safe coupling and decoupling of a ring or other coupling means on the trailer vehicle. Coupling is achieved in a straightforward motion by the application of downward force on hitch pin 44. However, clevis 36, and specifically pin engaging member 94, also increase the safety of the entire operation by locking the ring (not shown) in place, thus minimising the prospects that inadvertent de-coupling will take place at an inopportune time or place.<br>
Hitch pin 44 is fitted with a sleeve 104 at its lower end, which in combination with flange 106 on upper arm 40, prevents the upward removal of hitch pin 44 from clevis 36. Flange<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CAOl/01000<br>
106 extends into aperture 46 to define a smaller radius than sleeve 104. Thus, vertical sliding of pin 44 in aperture 46 is possible, but complete removal of pin 44 is prevented. Flange 108 within aperture 48 of lower arm 38 acts in a similar manner to prevent hitch pin 44 from being lowered to a position below lower arm 38, where it would be vulnerable to inadvertent contact by extraneous objects.<br>
Second end 30 of tongue 14 has attached on its underside a guide member 50. Guide member 50 may be welded (or otherwise fastened) to second end 30 or tongue 14 may be configured so that guide member 50 is integral with it. As illustrated in Figure 7, guide member 50 is "Y-shaped" and comprises rounded cam members 52, 54 which extend away from one anolher in a diverging relationship to define a central, rounded pocket 56, which generally faces towards tongue housing 12. An aperture 90 is located on tongue 14 in a location intermediate to first end 28 and second end 30, near to pocket 56.<br>
Turning to Figures 4 and 7, bottom wall 18 of housing 12 comprises a "W-shaped" guide member 60, which in operation matingly receives guide member 50 upon retraction of tongue 14 within housing 12. To accommodate this mating reception, guide members 50 and 60 are coplanar with one another. Guide member 60 comprises rounded central cam member 62 and adjacent rounded pockets 64,66, which generally face a direction away from tongue housing 12. Outside edges 68, 70 flare outwardly from pockets 64, 66, respectively. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, bottom wall 18 need not necessarily comprise guide member 60. Rather, these could be separate elements whereby bottom wall 18 is identical in shape to top wall 16 and guide member 60 was attached to the underside of that embodiment of bottom wall 18 (it will be understood that in such an arrangement, guide member 50 would be similarly modified so that it remained coplanar with guide member 60). However, bottom wall 18 and guide member 60 are described herein as one integral element<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 5, lock pin housing 72 is attached on the upper surface oftop wall 16ofhousing 12. Lock pin housing 72 comprises bevelled side walls 74,76 and a top wall 78. The bevelled shape of side walls 74,76 acts to deflect any inadvertent blows to hitch 10. Housing 72 houses lock pin 80, which is biased downwardly by spring 83. Spring '83 is coiled around a vertical shaft 84 of lock pin 80 and between top wall 78 and spring retaining member 82, maintained on shaft 84 by notch 85, which extends through shaft 84. Lock pin 80 is insertable through apertures 86,88,90 and 91, found respectively in top wall 78, top wall 16, tongue 14 and bottom wall 18 (see Figure 5). When lock pin 80 is inserted through aligned apertures 86,88, 90 and 91, tongue 14 is "locked" in a fixed axial and lateral position relative to tongue housing 12.<br>
Hitch 10 operates in the following manner. Towing vehicle 27, having hitch 10<br>
attached to its rear end as described above and illustrated in Figure 14, is positioned near to the<br>
forward end ofa trailer vehicle (not shown). At this time, tongue 14 is in its "locked" position of<br>
'Figure 1 (i.e. guide members 50 and 60 are matingly received and lock pin 80 is inserted through<br>
apertures 86, 88, 90 and 91). In order to couple hitch 10 to the trailer vehicle (not shown), lock<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CA01/01000<br>
pin 80 is lifted upwardly against the bias of spring 83 and withdrawn from apertures 91 and 90, of bottom wall 18 and tongue 14, respectively. Lock pin 80 is not, however, removed from apertures 86 and 88. Tongue 14 is then extended from throat 23 and manually positioned so that clevis 3 6 can be coupled to a cooperating coupling means (not shown) provided on a trailer vehicle or alternatively on a draw bar (not shown) attached to the forward end of a trailer vehicle (not shown). This "unlocking" and coupling action is achieved in a straight-forward and timely manner, allowing hitch 10 to be used repeatedly and efficiently by an operator over a period of time. This simple, yet reliable action may be particularly advantageous for coupling an airport tractor to a freight cart, which is done repeatedly and continuously by airport employees during the course of a day.<br>
Tongue 14 is capable of extension until trunnion 32 engages vertical wall 24 immediately surrounding slot 26. This defines the length of the axial extension of tongue 14. Lateral articulation of tongue 14 is possible to couple imprecisely aligned towing and trailer vehicles. Specifically, tongue 14 is freetoarticulate laterally, subjectonly to the lateral constraints of side walls 20,22 wrtbin throat 23, as soon as lock pin 80 is raised from apertures 91 and 90. Very little, if any, axial extension of tongue 14 is required for lateral articulation to be possible, thus permitting coupling of misaligned vehicles which are in very close proximity to one another. When tongue 14 is fully extended, trunnion 32 engages vertical wall 24 of housing 12 as described above and provides a point at which second end 3 0 of tongue 14 can pivot relative to first end 28. This is illustrated by arrow 7 and the phantom outline of tongue 14 and guide member 5 0 in Figure 7.<br>
Whenever tongue 14 is not in its "locked position" of Figure 1, lock pin 80 will be downwardly biased by spring 82 so that it rides along the top surface 14a of tongue 14.<br>
After tongue 14 is manually positioned (axially and/or laterally), clevis 36 can then be coupled to cooperating coupling means, such as a ring (not shown). As explained above, this is accomplished by inserting downward force on bitch pin 44 causing it to be inserted through the ring (not shown). Hitch pin 44 can be downwardly inserted from its position in Figure 1, through a ring member (not shown), until its lower end is at least partially within aperture 48. Pin engaging member 94, through the bias of spring 96, returns to its angled position of Figure 6, frictionally engaging bitch pin 44 and thus preventing any vertical movement of the hitch pin 44 which would allow the inadvertent de-coupling of the ring member (not shown). Grooves 102 assist in this "locking11 of hitch pin 44.<br>
Once this coupling takes place, the towing vehicle 27 is advanced in a forward direction. Very shortly thereafter, the brakes of the towing vehicle 27 are applied. As a result of applying the brakes, the forward inertia of the trailer vehicle (not shown) will cause tongue 14 to retract from an extended position and slide further into throat 23. If the towing and trailer vehicles are precisely aligned upon coupling, mis retraction takes place in a simple manner until guide members 50 and 60 matingly engage and lock pin 80 fells through apertures 91 and 90 when<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CAO1/01000<br>
aperture 90 becomes aligned with apertures 86, 88 and 91.<br>
I£ however, the towing and trailer vehicles are imprecisely aligned upon coupling, the smooth guided movement of tongue 14 into its locked position of Figure 2 is achieved through: (1) the interaction of guide members 50 and 60, and specifically, the mating reception of cam members 52,54 and 62 and pockets 64,66 and 56; and (2) the interaction of tongue 14 with side walls 20 and 22. Figures 7-10 illustrate this progression.<br>
Turning to Figure 7, tongue 14 is illustrated in an extended, laterally misaligned position. The shape of throat 23 permits tongue 14 to be laterally articulated to a large degree, as illustrated in Figure 7, though it is possible to modify hitch 10 so that the articulation range can meet various operational requirements. This wide range of lateral articulation is advantageous because it permits hitch 10 to couple towing and trailer vehicles from misaligned positions that might not be possible with prior art hitches. Additionally, it permits the movement of tongue 14 to its locked position from any number of laterally misaligned positions.<br>
Following coupling to the coupling means on a trailer vehicle (not shown), the forward inertia of the trailer vehicle (achieved as described above) causes tongue 14 to retract further into throat 23, as illustrated in Figure 8. During this retraction, an outer edge 54a of cam member 54 engages outside edge 70 of guide member 60. Continued retraction of tongue 14 into throat 23 pulls cam member 54 into engagement with pocket 66 of guide member 60 (see Figure 9). Guide member 5 0 then pivots about a rounded front portion 54b of cam member 54 and into alignment with guide member 60 as follows. Pocket 56 engages cam member 62 of guide member 60. Cam member 52 then falls into place, first upon the engagement of its inner edge 52c with cam member 62, and second, upon further retraction of tongue 14, by the engagement of a rounded front portion 52b with rounded pocket 64 of guide member 60. When cam members 52, 54 and 62 are fully received by pockets 64, 66 and 56, respectively, aperture 90 becomes fully aligned with apertures 86, 88 and 91, allowing lock pin 80 to be inserted therethrough by the downward bias of spring 83, thus moving hitch 10 to its "locked" position, illustrated in Figure 10. Hitch 10 is "locked" in that tongue 14 is fixed, laterally and longitudinally, relative to tongue housing 12. As illustrated in Figures 7-10, hitch 10 is thus self-aligning in that it operates to facilitate alignment of towing and trailer vehicles.<br>
The progression of tongue 14 from its position in Figure 7 to its position in Figure 10 is achieved not only by the mating engagement of coplanar guide members 50 and 60, but also through the interaction of tongue 14 with side walls 20 and 22. Referring to Figure 7, the opposite side edges of tongue 14, upon retraction, are slidably engaged by a rear edge 20b of side wall 20 and a front edge 22c ofside wall 22. The sliding engagement of tongue 14 within and into throat 23 helps with the smooth, guided movement of tongue 14 from its most laterally articulated position (Figure 7) into its locked, aligned and fully retracted position (Figure 10). It will be appreciated that tongue 14 may be slidably engaged by only one of side walls 20 and 22 from laterally misaligned positions between its lateral articulation range, illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CA01/01000<br>
Once tongue 14 moves into its locked position of Figure 10, the operator is thus free to move the towing vehicle-trailer vehicle train to its destination. Ike mating engagement of guide members 50 and 60, as well as the abutment of vertical arm support wall 42 with tongue housing 12 and lock pin housing 72, causes hitch 10 to have a sturdy construction in its locked position.. This sturdy construction minimizes the possibility of damage occurring to hitch 10 upon any inadvertent collisions involving the towing or trailer vehicles when hitch 10 is in use.<br>
It will be appreciated that the engagement of guide members 50 and 60 can occur in the opposite manner as described above. That is, the imprecise alignment of the vehicles may occur in such a manner that it is cam member 52 of guide member 50 which first engages pocket 64 of guide member 60 and men guide member 5 0 is pivoted until cam member 54 engages pocket 66. This would occur, for example, from the laterally misaligned position as shown in phantom outline in Figure 7. It will also be appreciated that tongue 14 can move from any number of laterally misaligned positions within the lateral articulation range of tongue 14 illustrated in Figure 7 to its locked position, depending upon the positions of the towing and trailer vehicles.<br>
It will also be appreciated that the arrangement of hitch 10 helps to overcome the previously-discussed problems that prior art hitch assemblies may suffer from. The rounded edges of cam members 52,54 and 62 and pockets 64,66,56, as well as the interaction of tongue 14 with side walls 20 and 22 in throat 23, allow for the smooth, guided transition of tongue 14 from an extended, misaligned position to its locked position. Because of this arrangement of hitch 10, it is not necessary to first align the vehicles before applying the brakes, as it is with some prior art hitches. Rather, the arrangement of hitch 10 allows for the self-alignment of tongue 14 with housing 12 upon the forward inertia of tongue 14 from any number of laterally misaligned positions. Ttus is advantageous in situations where the operator is faced with limited room to operate, thus limiting the ability to move the towing vehicle-trailer vehicle train into aligned arrangement before locking the hitch.<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosure, many alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of this invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. For example, clevis 36 could be replaced with a ring 110 or a ball 112, illustrated respectively in Figures 11 and 12, or any other suitable means for coupling bitch 10 to a trailer vehicle (not shown). Similarly, hitch 10 could be modified as illustrated hi Figure 13 so that the attachment of housing 12 to the towing vehicle 27 could be accomplished by the engagement of square tubing portion 114 with corresponding square tubing portion 116, mounted on the underside of a towing vehicle (not shown). Pin 118 is insertable through apertures 114a and 116a on portions 114 and 116 to maintain portion 114 within portion 116, thus attaching bitch 10 to the towing vehicle 27. In the embodiment of the hitch illustrated hi Figure 13, square tubing portion 114 would thus replace lock pin housing 72 from the previously discussed embodiment and would be attached to tongue housing 12 by means of welding or the like to a top surface 16a of top wall 16. Figure 15 illustrates this embodiment of the hitch in association with a towing vehicle 27. hi Figure 15, clevis 36 has been replaced with ball 112.<br>

WO 02/04238	PCT/CAO1/O1000<br>
Similarly, it is within the inventive scope herein to utilize hitch 10 not only on the rear of towing vehicle 27, but also on the rear of a trailer vehicle (not shown) where more than one trailer vehicle (not shown) will be pulled by the same towing vehicle. In theory, each trailer vehicle in a multiple trailer vehicle train could be fitted on its rear end with bitch 10 for coupling to a following trailing trailer.<br>
Similarly, it is within the inventive scope of the invention to attach hitch 10 to the front of a trailer vehicle, rather than to a rear surface of towing vehicle 27. In such an embodiment, tongue 14 would thus extend (after pin 8 0 is unlocked) away from the trailer vehicle (not shown) and towards towing vehicle 27 for coupling to a coupler attached to the rear of towing vehicle 27. In such an embodiment, it would be guide member 60 which would rnatingly engage guide member 50 upon the forward inertia of the trailer vehicle (not shown), rather than the opposite as described above.<br>
Similarly, it would also be possible to modify hitch 10 for use as an intermediate between veWcleshavmgakeady-instaUeda)uplingmeans. That is, housing 12 could be fitted with a coupling means (not shown) for coupling to coupling means (not shown) attached to a rear end of a towing vehicle. Clevis 3 6 could men be used to couple to corresponding coupling means (not shown) at the front of a trailer vehicle (not shown) and the operation of hitch 10 would remain the same as described above, except that hitch 10 would be releasably coupled to both the towing vehicle and the trailer vehicle.<br>
Similarly, it is within the inventive scope of the invention to modify the length of tongue 14, if the need arises.<br>
The elements of hitch 10 are preferably constructed of a durable steel material, though it will be appreciated that this is not required for operation of hitch 10. Tongue housing 12 and clevis 36 have both been illustrated herein as being of a cast construction. Alternatively, these elements could be constructed of multiple layered, horizontal plates which are fastened (by bolting, welding or any other suitable means) together.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the clevis of the invention could be attached directly to a vehicle, apart from hitch 10 as described, for use in coupling other-vehicles. This embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 16.<br>
Hitch 120 is comprised of clevis 136, which is identical in structure and operation to clevis 36 described above and illustrated in Figures 1-3, 6, 13 and 14 except that clevis upper arm 140 is illustrated as being constructed from horizontal plates 140a, 140b and 140c. Plate 140a is integral with vertical arm support wall 142. Plates 140a, 140b and 140c are fastened together by any suitable means (such as welding or bolts). Upperarm 140 could also be of a cast construction, as illustrated for upper arm 40 of clevis 36 in Figure 6.<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CA01/01000<br>
Hitch 120 also comprises wall 146, attached to forward portions of upper arm 140, lower arm 138 and vertical arm support wall 142. Wall 146 may be conveniently be bolted (through apertures 148 and 149) to an airport freight vehicle 150, as illustrated in Figure 20, an airport pallet or container carrier 152, as illustrated in Figure 19,ortoanyothertowingortrailer vehicle.    Wall 146 could alternatively be attached by welding to the towing or trailer vehicle.<br>
Figures 17 and 18 illustrate prior art "E" type hitches, which are in common use<br>
on airport carts and carriers. Some **E" type hitches, such as hitch 160 illustrated in Figure 17,<br>
do not iinclude any mechanism to lock the hitch pin in a lowered position, other than the bias of a<br>
spring 162 (when notch 164 is rotated to disengage locking member 166, and the hitch pin is<br>
lowered). This is disadvantageous since inadvertent de-coupling can occur if the spring<br>
malfunctions and the hitch pin rises, allowing the trailer vehicle's coupling means to be released<br>
from hitch 160. Other "E" type,hrtches, such as hitch 170, illustrated in Figure 18, include a<br>
slotted spring plate 172 that prevents upward or downward movement of the hitch pin from its<br>
Ioweredorraisedposraom,respe
"E" hitch illustrated in Figure 18 is, however, disadvantageous because the unlocking of the hitch can be difficult when the operator is in a hurry. Slot 174 can easily become misaligned relative to locking member 176 so that the operator will be forced to see or manually feel for the alignment of slot 174 and locking member 176, something which may be difficult in dark conditions or inclement weather. Further, "E" type hitches often have a "high" profile so that when used on airport freight vehicles they can interfere with the loading and unloading of the freight vehicles when the hitch pin is inadvertently left in its raised position.<br>
Hitch 120 overcomes these disadvantages by providing a low profile, easy to manufacture hitch which automatically locks its hitch pin in both its lowered and raised positions, thus increasing the safety of the entire operation. Hitch 120 is also easy and quick to operate.<br>
Figures21 and 22 illustrate a hitch 210 having an alternative embodiment of the bottom wall described above and illustrated in Figures 4 and 7-10.<br>
In contrast to bottom wall 18 (of hitch 10), hitch 210 differs in that bottom wall 218 includes a rounded pocked 219 and two edges 221, 223 adjacent thereto which flare outwardly from one another in a diverging relationship. Rounded pocket 219 faces a direction opposite of rounded pockets 264,266 and is located opposite of rounded central cam member 262. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the recess in bottom wall 218 forming rounded pocket 219 results in a different shape for the slot (not shown) of vertical wall 224, as compared to slot 26 defined in vertical wall 24 of hitch 10.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 21, first end 228 of tongue 214 is capable of being extended into tongue housing 212 when tongue 214 is fully extended. This differs from hitch 10 where first end 28 oftongue 14 is not capable of being extended into tongue housing 12 due to the engagement of trunnion 32 against vertical wall 24 (see Figure 7). To accommodate this extension<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CA01/01000<br>
for hitch 210, trunnion 232 on tongue 214 extends only vertically below tongue 214 and does not extend vertically above tongue 214 as trunnion 32 does above tongue 14 with hitch 10. As a result, tongue 214 is capable of being extended until trunnion 232 engages rounded pocket 219, as illustrated in Figure 21, thus providing additional extension of tongue 214 in comparison to tongue 14ofhitch 10 (see Figure 7). Tongue 214 is prevented from being removed from the throat of hitch 210 by the engagement of trunnion 232 and rounded pocket 219. Rounded pocket 219 also provides a pivot point for tongue 214 to articulate from when tongue 214 is fully extended and hitch 210 is used to couple two laterally misaligned vehicles.<br>
Bottom wall 218 of hitch 210 does not have an aperture corresponding to aperture 91 in bottom wall 18 of hitch 10. Rounded pocket 219 is aligned with apertures (not shown) in top wall 216 (corresponding to aperture 88 in top wall 16 of hitch 10) and in the top wall of the lock pin housing (corresponding to aperture 86 in top wall 76 of lock pin housing 72 of hitch 10). A lock pin 28 0 (corresponding to lock pin 8 0 of hitch 10) locks tongue 214 into the fully retracted, locked position of Figure 22 upon the alignment of the aperture 290 in tongue 214 (corresponding to aperture 90 in tongue 14) and the apertures in top wall 216 and the top wall of the lock pin housing (not shown).<br>
Hitch 210 is otherwise identical to hitch lOin terms of structure and operation.<br>
Figures 23 and 24 illustrate a hitch 310 having an alternative embodiment of the tongue housing described above and illustrated in Figure 1. Tongue housing 312 allows hitch 310 to be attached to a towing (or trailer) vehicle without the tongue 314 being inserted through (as in Figure 14) or underneath the rear surface of the vehicle. Tongue housing 312 has been modified to accommodate the entire retraction range of tongue 314 therein.<br>
Tongue housing 312 includes a top wall 316, a bottom wall 318, two spaced apart side walls 320, 322 and a vertical wall 324.<br>
Bottom wall 318, as illustrated in Figure 24, is configured like bottom wall 218 (in that it includes a rounded pocket 319 like rounded pocket 219) except that the outward side edges 318aand318bflareoutwardlyinadivergingrelarionship. It will beappreciatedtnat bottom wall 318 could alternatively be configured similar to bottom wall 18 (i.e. not including a rounded pocket 319), rather than bottom wall 218.<br>
Side walls 320,322 are identical to side walls 20,22 of hitch 10 with the similar exception that the outward side edges thereof flare outwardly in a diverging relationship similar to outside edges 318a and 318b of bottom wall 318.<br>
Top wall 316 differs from top wall 16in that it extends a length greater than the length of tongue 214, until it attaches to vertically-extendhig wall 324. That is, top wall 316 extends beyond first end 328 of tongue 314 when tongue 314 is in its locked position, as illustrated<br>
-19-<br><br>
WO 02/04238	PCT/CAO1/01000<br>
in Figure 24. The outward side edges of top wall 316 flare away from one another in a diverging relationship like bottom wall 318 and side walls 320,322. Lower side wails 325,327 are attached at the lower, forward edges of top wall 316 and extend downwardly to the depth of bottom wall 318. Tongue housing 312 is thus fen-shaped (in that forward end 312a of tongue housing 312 is wider than rear end 312b) and defines an interior cavity between side walls 325, 327 to accommodate the retraction of tongue 314 from laterally misaligned positions.<br>
Tongue housing 312 does not include a vertical wall similar to vertical wall 24 as in hitch 10.<br>
Lock pin housing 372 is not illustrated in Figure 23 with bevelled side walls (as with housing 72 of hitch 10), though it will be appreciated that such a modification could readily be made.<br>
Tongue housing 312 may also include a bracket 329 for storage of a chain.<br>
Tongue housing 312 is attached to a vertical surface of a towing (or trailer) vehicle by attaching vertical wall 324 thereto by welding, or any other suitable fastening means (e.g. bolting, etc.). The &amp;11 range of motion of first end 328 of tongue 314 is thus within tongue housing 312 and it is not necessary to insert tongue 314 through or underneath the rear wall of the vehicle.<br>
Otherwise, hitch 310 is identical in operation to hitch 10 and hitch 210 as described above.<br>
Accordingly, the scope of the invention is to be construed in accordance with the substance defined by the following claims.<br>
