WO 02/22309<br>
POLISHING PAD COMPRISING PARTICULATE POLYMER AND CROSSLINKED POLYMER BINDER<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to polishing pads. 5 In particular, the polishing pads of the present invention are porous and composed of particulate polymer, e.g., particulate crosslinked polymer, and crosslinked organic polymer binder that binds the particulate polymer together. Polishing pads according to the present invention are useful for polishing<br>
10 articles, e.g., the chemical mechanical polishing or planarization of semiconductor substrates.<br>
The polishing or planarization of the rough surface of an article, e.g., a semiconductor substrate, to a smooth surface generally involves rubbing the rough surface with the<br>
15 work surface of a polishing pad using a controlled and<br>
repetitive motion. Typically, a polishing fluid is interposed between the rough surface of the article that is to be polished and the work surface of the polishing pad. The polishing fluid may optionally contain an abrasive material,<br>
20 e.g., particulate cerium oxide.<br>
The fabrication of semiconductor wafers typically involves the formation of a plurality of integrated circuits on a semiconductor substrate of, for example, silicon or gallium arsenide. The integrated circuits are generally •<br>
25  formed by means of a series of process steps in which<br>
patterned layers of materials, such as conductive, insulating and semiconducting materials, are formed on the substrate. In order to maximize the density of integrated circuits per wafer, it is necessary to have an extremely planar precision<br>
30 polished substrate at various stages throughout the semiconductor wafer production process. As such, semiconductor wafer production typically involves at least<br><br><br>

	PCT/US0I/28948<br><br><br><br><br>
one, and more typically a plurality of polishing steps, which involve the use of one or more polishing pads.<br>
The polishing steps typically involve rotating the polishing pad and/or semiconductor wafer substrate against 5 each.other in the presence of a polishing fluid.  The<br>
polishing fluid is often mildly alkaline and may optionally<br>
contain abrasive particulate materials, e.g., silica. The pad<br>
acts to mechanically polish the semiconductor substrate, while<br>
the polishing fluid serves to chemically polish the substrate<br>
10 and to facilitate the removal and transport of abraded<br>
material off of and away from the rough surface of the<br>
article.	'<br>
The pressure at which the polishing pad and substrate are pressed against each other, and the rate at 15 which chey are turned against each other is generally<br>
maintained within high tolerances to ensure a controlled rate of substrate removal. Unfortunately, polishing and planarization characteristics are often variable from pad-to-pad, and throughout the operating lifetime of a given pad 20  (i.e., intrapad variability) .  Correspondingly, variations in the polishing characteristics of the pads typically results in inadequately polished and planarized substrates, which may have to be scrapped. Physical properties of polishing pads Chat can result in variable polishing characteristics include, 25  for example, variations in pore volume and pore size from oxia pad to the next, and within a single pad.<br>
It is desirable to develop polishing pads that exhibit reduced and preferably minimal pad-to~pad variation in polishing and planarization characteristics.  It is further 3 0 desirable to develop polishing pads that exhibit reduced and preferably minimal variations in polishing and planarization characteristics throughout the operating lifetime of the pad.<br><br>

10	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The cross linked organic polymer binder (b) of polishing pads according to the present invention, binds.the particulate polymer (a) together in the pad. While not intending to be bound by any theory, and based on the evidence IS at hand, it is believed that there is minimal to no- sintering, e.g.., melt, sintering, between the particles of the particulate  polymer in polishing pads according to the present invention. When the particulate polymer of the pad comprises particulate thermoplastic polymer, the polishing pad is prepared below the 20 melting or sintering point of the particulate thermoplastic polymer, as will be discussed further herein. Particulate crosslinked polymers as defined herein, do not have a melting or sintering point, and correspondingly are not sinterable.<br>
The particulate polymer of the polishing pad may be 25 prepared by methods that are known to the skilled artisan.<br>
For example, bulk thermoplastic polymers and bulk crosslinked polymers may each be cryogenically ground and classified into desired particle size ranges.  In an embodiment of the present invention, the particulate crossslinkedT polymer is prepared 30  directly by reacting a.two-component composition in the<br>
prosence of a heated and agitated liquid medium in which the two-computer composition is  substantially insolublT, e.g an aqueous medium (as will be discussed further herein) . The<br><br>

shape of the particulate polymer may be regular and/or<br>
irregular, and may be selected from shapes including, for<br>
example, spherical, disk, flake and combinations and/or<br>
mixtures thereof,<br>
5	The particulate polymer of the polishing pad<br>
typically has an average particle size of at least 20 microns,  preferably at least 50 microns, and more preferably at least 100 microns. The particulate polymer typically has an average particle size of less than 500 microns, preferably less than 10 400 microns, and more preferably less than 300 microns. The average .particle size of the particulate polymer may range between any combination of these upper and lower amounts,-inclusive of the recited'values. The average particle size of the particulate polymer may be determined by methods that are •<br>
r<br>
IS. well known to the skilled artisan, e.g., using analytical<br>
instrumentation, such as a Coulter LS particle size analyzer.<br>
In an embodiment of the present .invention, the particulate polymer is substantially solid. As used herein and in the claims, and with reference to the particulate<br>
20 polymer of the polishing pad, by "substantially solid" is<br>
meant that the particulate polymer is not hollow, e.g., it is not in the form hollow microcapsules.  While the substantially solid particulate polymer may contain entrapped gas, the entrapped gas bubbles have an average diameter that is<br>
25 typically less than half the average diameter of the particulate polymer.<br>
The particulate polymer of the polishing pad of the present invention may be selected from particulate thermoplastic polymer. As used herein and in the claims, by<br>
30  "thermoplastic polymer" is meant a polymeric material that softens or melts when heated above its softening or melting point, and returns to its original condition when cooled below its softenincr or meltincr ooint.  The particulate<br><br><br>
