  application claims priority from U. S. Provisional Application Serial Nos. 60/284,666; 60/284,667; 60/284, 668; 60/284 ; 669 all filed April 18, 2001, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chronic pain is a major contributor to disability and is the cause of an untold amount of suffering. The successful treatment of severe and chronic pain is a primary goal of the physician with opioid analgesics being<br>
preferred drugs.<br>
Until recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes were designated as µ,  and K. As opiates had a high affinity to these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify andjisolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as cnkcphalins, endorphins and dynorphins.<br>
Recent experimentation has led to the identification of a cDNA encoding an opioid receptor-like (ORL1) receptor with a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. This newly discovered receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homi|)logy. It was initially demonstrated that non-selective ligands having a high affinity for µ, 8 and K receptors had low affinity for the ORL1 . This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the term"orphan receptor".<br>
Subsequent research ld to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL1 receptor. This ligand is a seventeen ajmino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family.<br>
The discovery of the PRLl receptor presents an opportunity in drug discovery for novel compounds which can be administered fcjr pain management or other syndromes modulated by this receptor.<br>
All documents cited Iferein, including the foregoing, are incorporated by reference in their entireties for all<br>
purposes.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Nociceplin affinity at the ORL1 receptor for preferred compounds was obtained using the following assay: Membranes from reco^nbinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor- like receptor (ORL-1) (Receptor Biology) wjere prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM 1IHPHS. pH 7.4) (10 ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assayi reagent with bovine serurn albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-1 receptor membranes were stored at-80°C.<br>
Functional SGTPgS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding firjal concentrations of 0.066 mg/ml ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 mg/ml saponin, 3 mM GDP and 0.20 nM [3Sfc] GTPgStobindingbuffer(100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. The prepared menibrane solution (190 ml/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 ml of 20x concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-welI Unifilter G1-7B tiller plates (Packard) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 ml ice-cold! binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty ml/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.<br>

EXAMPLE 9<br>
Nociceptin affinity at the ORL1 receptor for preferred compounds was obtained using the following assay: Membranes from recojmbinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor-like receptor (ORJL-1) (Receptor Biology) wjere prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HKPES. pll 7.4) (10; ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORJL-1 receptor membranes were stored at-80°C.<br>
Functional SGTPgS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0.066 mg/ml ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 mg/ml saponin, 3 mM GDP and 0.20 nM |35S] GTPgS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCI, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7. 4) on ice. The prepared membrane solution (190 ml/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 ml of 20ix concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room tempettature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96- well Unifilter GF-/B filter plates (Packard) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 ml ice-cold: binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty ml/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counteid in aPackard Top-Count for 1 min/well.<br>

Procedure:<br>
Sodium hydride 60% dispersion in mineral oil (0.67 g, 16.7 mmol) was washed with dry pentane and then suspended in 80 mL of dry THF under N2. Compound 1 (European patent 0029707) (3.80 g, 11.1 mmol) was added, the mixture stiijred at room temperature for 15 min and then warmed to 50°C. Ethyl bromide (1.06 mL, 13.3 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture stirred at 50°C for 18 hr. TLC (SiO2, CH2C12: MeOH 96: 4) showed that the reaction was ca 40% complete. Additional sodium hydride (0.67 g) and ethyl bromide (1.06 mL) were added. After heating at 50°C for an additional 24 hr the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched with water. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate (Ix). The combined organic extracts were washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (Ix), dried over MgSO4 and the; solvent was evaporated to give the crude product as a yellow solid. Trituration with dicthyl ether gave purf 2 as a white solid (3.38 g, 82%).<br>

To a solution of 2 (3. 60 g, 9.74 mmol) in 100 mL of ethyl acetate was added a 25 mL of a 1: 1 mixture of ethyl acetate and concentrated HCI. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 2hr. and evaporated to dryness. The residue was neutralized with 50 mL of methanolic ammonia 10:1 and again evaporated to dryness» The residue was suspended in 100 mL a 1: 1 mixture of MeOH and CH2C12, filtered and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to leave an off-white solid. Flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting with CH2CI2:MeOH:NH3 (300:10: 1) gave pure 3 as a white crystalline solid (1.98 g, 76%).<br>

EXAMPLE 15<br>
Nociceptin affinity at the ORL1 receptor for preferred compounds was obtained using the following assay:<br>
Membranes from recqmbinant HEK-293 cells expressing the human opioid receptor- like receptor (ORL-1) (Receptor Biology) were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (2.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HF.PHS. pH 7.4) (10 ml/10 cm dish) followed by homogenization with a tissue grinder/teflon pestle. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-1 receptor membranes were stored at -80°C.<br>
Functional SGTPgS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-1 membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding fiifial concentrations of 0.066 mg/ml ORL-1 membrane protein, 10 mg/ml saponin, 3 mM GDP and 0.20 nM [35$] GTPgS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. The prepared membrane solution (190 ml/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 ml of 2(|x concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96- well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Packard) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Brandel) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 ml ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty ml/well scintillation cocktail (BetaScint; Wallac) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.<br>
Data was analyzed using the curve fitting functions in GraphPad PRISMO, v. 3.0 and the results are set forth<br>
