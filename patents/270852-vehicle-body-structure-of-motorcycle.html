[Title of the Invention] Vehicle Body Structure of Motorcycle [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates generally to a vehicle body structure of a motorcycle and, more particularly, to an improved structure surrounding a serial number marking portion. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
A known vehicle body structure of a motorcycle includes a seat lock bracket for supporting a rear edge portion of a seat, the seat lock bracket including a serial number marking portion allowing a serial number to be easily checked from an outside of the vehicle by looking inside the seat from behind.<br>
[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Utility Model Laid-open No. Hei 2-38389 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
In this conventional vehicle body structure, however, the serial number marking portion is open to the<br>
outside of the vehicle at all times. The serial number can therefore at times appear on the outside and there is concern that the serial number marking portion will be contaminated with mud, muddy water, and the like present on the outside of the vehicle. [0004]<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle body structure of a motorcycle allowing a serial number marking portion to be easily and clearly visible only when it is so necessary. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
To achieve the foregoing object, the present invention provides a vehicle body structure of a motorcycle including an openable storage chamber (for example, a storage box 8 according to an embodiment of the present invention to be described later).  The structure is characterized in that a serial number marking portion (for example, a bracket 29 according to the embodiment of the present invention to be described later) is disposed on a back portion of a wall of the storage chamber on an outside of the vehicle and that the wall (for example, a wall 16a according to the embodiment of the present invention to be described later) of the<br>
storage chamber includes a check window (for example, a check window 26 according to the embodiment of the present invention to be described later) through which the serial number marking portion is visible when the storage chamber is opened.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the check window is shielded from the outside when the storage chamber is closed and the serial number marking portion on the side of the back portion of the wall of the storage chamber becomes visible through the check window when the storage chamber is opened. [0006]<br>
In a motorcycle, which includes a storage box disposed downward of an openable seat and in which the storage box constitutes the storage chamber, it is appropriate that a serial number marking portion be disposed on a back portion of a wall, which stands substantially upright, of the storage box on an outside of the vehicle and that the wall include a check window.<br>
In this case, when the seat is closed, an inner surface of the wall of the storage box and the check window formed in the wall are shielded from the outside. When the seat is opened, the serial number marking portion on the side of the back portion becomes visible<br>
through the check window. [0007]<br>
It is desirable herein that a rear fender (for example, a rear fender 80 according to the embodiment of the present invention to be described later) disposed upward of a rear wheel be extended up to a position downward of the check window in the wall of the storage box, in an area downward of the serial number marking portion.<br>
In this case, muddy water, dust, and the like entered to reach the serial number marking portion or the check window from the side of the rear wheel can be shielded with the rear fender. Accordingly, entry of the muddy water or dust in the serial number marking portion or the storage box can be prevented even more effectively. [Effect of the Invention] [0008]<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the check window can be shielded from the outside when the storage chamber is closed and the serial number marking portion can be viewed through the check window only when the storage chamber is opened. This allows the serial number marking portion to be viewed easily and clearly by opening the storage chamber only when it is so necessary.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention] [0009]<br>

Throughout the descriptions given hereunder, "forward" means the direction of travel of the vehicle in the forward direction, and "right" and "left" means the right-hand side and the left-hand side, respectively, of the vehicle looking to the forward direction of travel of the vehicle. [0010]<br>
Fig. 1 is a side elevational view showing schematically a motorcycle according to an embodiment of the present invention. The motorcycle according to the embodiment of the present invention is what is called a scooter type, low- floor vehicle.  In the motorcycle, a steering column 2 connected to a handlebar 1 is rotatably supported at a middle portion thereof on a head pipe 3 forming part of a vehicle body frame. A front wheel Wi is supported via a front fork 4 on a lower end side of the steering column 2 . A down pipe 6 is connected to the head pipe 3 . The down pipe 6 extends downwardly toward a rear portion of the vehicle body. A rear portion frame 7<br>
(vehicle body frame) is connected to a rear end of the down pipe 6. The rear portion frame 7 extends upwardly toward the rear portion of the vehicle body.  The rear portion frame 7 is disposed on both the right and left sides of the vehicle body, mutually connected together at a rear end portion of the vehicle body. [0011]<br>
The rear portion frame 7 is mounted with a storage box 8 and a fuel tank 9 arranged in tandem in the fore-aft direction of the vehicle body.  The storage box 8 is for storing a helmet, luggage, and the like. A double seat type seat 10, on which a rider sits, is mounted upward of the storage box 8 and the fuel tank 9.  The seat 10 can be opened or closed by raising or lowering its side of a front end portion in a vertical direction about a hinge. A step floor 11, on which the rider can rest his or her feet, is disposed forward of the seat 10.  The step floor 11 is provided one step lower. [0012]<br>
A power unit 12 including an engine and a transmission is vertically swingably supported on the rear portion frame 7 via a pivot not shown and a hanger link 13. A rear wheel W2 is held by, and drivingly connected to, the power unit 12. A suspension member not<br>
shown is inserted between the power unit 12 and the rear portion frame 7. [0013]<br>
A pivot 15 of a main stand 14 is supported on a front end portion of the rear portion frame 7.  The main stand 14, when stood, is arranged to support the vehicle body in an upright position at a position substantially immediately under the seat 10. [0014]<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, the storage box 8 includes a box main body portion 16 and a fuel tank cover 17. The box main body portion 16 has an open upper surface side.  The fuel tank cover 17 extends rearwardly from a rear edge of an upper portion thereof. The box main body portion 16 and the fuel tank cover 17 are formed integrally from a resin material.  The box main body portion 16 has an upper surface inclined longitudinally such that the box main body portion 16 has a shallow front portion side and a rear portion side that is gradually deeper toward the rear end. A sealing member not shown disposed on the side of the seat 10 is to make tight contact with an outer peripheral edge portion of an opening 18. The fuel tank cover 17 is formed to have an outline that substantially follows an outline on the rear<br><br>
end side of the rear portion frame 7 as shown in Fig. 4. The fuel tank cover 17 is arranged to cover continuously from a seat lock mechanism 60 (see Fig. 7) to be described later and an area upward of the fuel tank 9. [0015]<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 through 6, the fuel tank cover 17 includes a ridge wall 20 disposed on an end edge of the fuel tank cover 17.  The ridge wall 20 is curved to extend from a rear portion to both side portions of the fuel tank cover 17.  The fuel tank cover 17 includes an opening 22 disposed substantially at a center of an area enclosed by the ridge wall 20. The opening 22 faces a filler port 21 of the fuel tank 9.  The side of a front end of the ridge wall 20 on the left of the vehicle body is mildly curved toward the front in cross section in a vehicle width direction. The curved portion and part of the wall continuing into the curved portion on the outside of the vehicle body serve as a side portion grip 23, at which the rider has a tip of his or her finger hooked when the rider deploys the stand.  The side portion grip 23 includes a threaded hole 24 disposed at a rear edge portion thereof for connecting a peripheral portion of the side portion grip 23 to the side of the rear portion frame 7.<br>
In Fig. 4, reference numeral 25 represents a window through which a lock lever 61 (see Fig. 7) of the seat lock mechanism 60 protrudes. [0016]<br>
A cross pipe 28 is welded to right and left sides of the rear portion frame 7. The cross pipe 28 connects the two sides of the rear portion frame 7 at points forward of the rear end portion thereof as shown in Fig. 4. A front edge portion of the fuel tank 9 is supported via a bracket 29 on the cross pipe 28.  A serial number n is stamped on a front surface of the bracket 29.  The front surface of the bracket 29 thus serves as a serial number marking portion according to the present invention. According to the embodiment of the present invention, a member serving as the serial number marking portion is provided on the bracket 29 that not only reinforces the vehicle body, but also supports the fuel tank 9.  This offers a benefit of reducing the number of parts used. [0017]<br>
A wall 16a standing substantially upright on the side rearward of the box main body portion 16 includes a check window 26 of a substantially rectangular shape.  The serial number n on the bracket 29 is visible and thus can be checked through this check window 26.  Referring to Fig.<br>
7, the check window 26 is disposed at a level, at which the check window 26 is easily visible from an obliquely upward direction inside the box main body portion 16. A pair of reinforcement ribs 71 is formed on an edge portion on a back side of the check window 26. The reinforcement ribs 71 function to enhance stiffness of an area surrounding the check window 26.  In addition, the check window 26 is blanked off by a removable lid member 27 as shown in Fig. 4. [0018]<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 through 10, the lid member 27 is formed into a substantially rectangular shape slightly larger than the check window 26. A peripheral wall 72 is provided on a back side of the lid member 27 in a protruding condition. The peripheral wall 72 can be fitted into the check window 26. A pair of locking tabs 73 is formed at a leading end portion of the peripheral wall 72.  When the peripheral wall 72 is fitted into the check window 26, the locking tabs 73 are engaged with edge portions on the back side of the check window 26.  In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, an outer peripheral area of the peripheral wall 72 of the lid member 27 makes a tight contact with an inner peripheral surface of the check window 26 substantially<br>
annularly.  This enhances hermetic sealing performance between the check window 26 and the lid member 27.  In addition, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the lid member 27 is so arranged as to blank off the check window 26. Accordingly, the inside of the storage box 8 can be maintained in a positively shielded condition relative to a space therebehind. [0019]<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 7, the motorcycle includes a rear fender 80 disposed downwardly of the rear portion frame 7.  The rear fender 80 covers an upward side of the rear wheel W2.  The rear fender 80 has a front end portion that extends in an area downward of the cross pipe 28 and the bracket 29 up to a position downward of the check window 26 in the box main body portion 16.  The extended end is connected to the wall 16a of the box main body portion 16. [0020]<br>
A bracket 30 is mounted on each of two sides of the rear portion frame 7 at a point rearward of the point of connection of the cross pipe 28 as shown in Fig. 4.  Root portions 32 on both sides of a grab rail 31 having substantially a U shape are connected to these brackets 30.<br>
[0021]<br>
The grab rail 31 is a rail which a pillion passenger sitting in a rear portion of the seat 10 grabs. The root portions 32 on both sides of the grab rail 31 are covered with edge portions on both sides of the fuel tank cover 17.  Extending portions extending from the root portions 32 overhang to the sides rearward of upper portions of the fuel tank cover 17 and the seat 10.  The root portions 32 on both sides of the grab rail 31 have bottom surfaces formed into flat surfaces to be overlapped with upper surfaces of the brackets 30.  Each of the root portions 32 includes a pair of threaded holes 33 spaced apart from each other in the fore-aft direction, Each of the root portions 32 is connected to the upper surface of the bracket 30 with bolts 34 tightened in the threaded holes 33. [0022]<br>
The root portion 32 of the grab rail 31 on the left-hand side of the vehicle body is secured as follows. Specifically, a support member 35 made of metal is overlapped with an upper edge of the threaded hole 33 on the front side.  The support member 35 is jointly fastened together with the grab rail 31 and the bracket 30 using the bolt 34.<br>
[0023]<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, the support member 35 includes a lower portion wall 36, an upper portion wall 37, and a pair of inclined walls 38.  The lower portion wall 36 and the upper portion wall 37 run in parallel with each other and are connected together by the pair of inclined walls 38.  The upper portion wall 37 of the support member 35 is disposed inboardly offset in the vehicle width direction relative to the lower portion wall 36.  With the lower portion wall 36 in a condition of being jointly fastened with the grab rail 31 and the rear portion frame 7 (bracket 30) using the bolt 34, the upper portion wall 37 is secured to the rear edge of the side portion grip 23 of the storage box 8 using a bolt 39.  The bolt 39 is passed through the threaded hole 24 in the side portion grip 23. A peripheral edge portion of the threaded hole 24 corresponds to a position in the side portion grip 23 supported by the support member 35.  The support position of the side portion grip 23 is disposed upwardly for at least a height of the support member 35<br>
(the distance between the lower portion wall 36 and the upper portion wall 37) and a thickness of the root portions 32 of the grab rail 31, relative to the portion of the grab rail 31 and the rear portion frame 7 (bracket<br>
30) fastened by the bolt 34.<br>
[0024]<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, the seat 10 disposed upward of the storage box 8 includes a bottom plate 40 and a cushion material 41.  The bottom plate 40 is formed from a hard resin.  The cushion material 41 is mounted on the bottom plate 40 and coated with a skin material 42 on the outside. An outer peripheral edge portion 51 of the seat 10 is formed to be curved downwardly so as to embrace an upper end portion of the box main body portion 16 and an outer peripheral region of the fuel tank cover 17.  The bottom plate 40 includes a recessed portion 43 formed so as to follow an upwardly protruding shape of the side portion grip 23.<br>
[0025]<br>
The vehicle body frame (the down pipe 6, the rear portion frame 7, and the like) is covered with a body cover 44 made of a resin as shown in Fig. 1.  The body cover 44 extends up to a point near an outer peripheral edge portion of the fuel tank cover 17 at an area downward of the seat 10.  The body cover 44 includes a depressed portion 45 (see Fig. 6) disposed at a position downward of the side portion grip 23.  The depressed portion 45 is curved toward the inside of the vehicle<br>
body so that the fingertip can be easily reached into the curved portion of the side portion grip 23.  The depressed portion 45 extends up to a point immediately below a root portion of the curved portion of the side portion grip 23. [0026]<br>
In the motorcycle whose structure has heretofore been described in detail, the check window 26 in the storage box 8 is normally blanked off by the lid member 27 and the seat 10 is closed in that condition. Accordingly, unless the seat 10 is opened by unlocking the seat lock mechanism 60, the serial number n on the bracket 29 cannot generally be viewed from the outside. [0027]<br>
To check the serial number n, the seat lock mechanism 60 is unlocked and the seat 10 is opened forward and, in that condition, the lid member 27 fitted in the check window 26 is removed. When, in this condition, an operator looks into the check window 26 through the inside of the storage box 8, the operator can now view the serial number n stamped on the bracket 29 through the check window 26. [0028]<br>
In the vehicle body structure of the motorcycle according the embodiment of the present invention as<br>
described in the foregoing, the bracket 29 as the serial number marking portion is normally shielded from the outside by the seat 10 and the lid member 27 as described above. Neither is it therefore possible to look into the serial number n from the outside, nor is it easy for the serial number n portion to be contaminated with dust, rainwater, and the like.  The serial number n in a contamination-free state can therefore be checked at all times.  In particular, in the embodiment of the present invention, the front end portion of the rear fender 80 covering the area upward of the rear wheel W2 extends up to the position downward of the check window 26 of the storage box 8 on the side downward of the bracket 29. This positively prevents muddy water, dust, and the like splashed from the rear wheel W2 from contaminating the serial number n portion or entering the storage box. [0029]<br>
It is to be noted herein that the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment and can be implemented in various manners without departing from the spirit thereof.  For instance, the following modifications are possible as well.  Specifically, the motorcycle in which the vehicle body structure is adopted is not limited to the scooter type, low floor vehicle;<br>
rather, the motorcycle may be a vehicle of any other type<br>
