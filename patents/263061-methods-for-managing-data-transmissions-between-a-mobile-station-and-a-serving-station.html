METHODS FOR MANAGING DATA TRANSMISSIONS<br>
BETWEEN A MOBILE STATION AND A SERVING STATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]             This invention relates generally to a data transmission management<br>
process between a mobile station and a serving station.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]             In the current Universal Mobile Telecommunication System<br>
("UMTS"), R4 compliant mobile stations are supported by a Network Assistant Cell<br>
Change procedure. Specifically, for networks that support a Cell Change Notification<br>
("CCN") mode, upon a mobile station delecting the need to change cells due to<br>
deteriorated radio frequency ("RF") conditions, the network is notified of the<br>
proposed cell change with a Packet Cell Change Notification ("PCCN") message from<br>
the mobile station. If the network knows the target cell data, the network responds<br>
accordingly by sending one or more Packet Neighbor Cell Data ("PNCD") messages<br>
back to the mobile station. Two general scenarios happen at this point. In one<br>
scenario where the network determines that the ce I hchoscn try the mobile station is-an<br>
optimal cell, the network sends a-PacketCell ChangeCcaitinac:j(rPCCC")'mcssage w<br>
the mobile station. If, on the other hand,, in the-secondscenario where.the-network<br>
determines that the-cell chosen i&gt;y the mobile .station is nor a&amp;oriiirnatcell, aPacket<br>
Cell Change Ordcr-.("PCCOn) message, is sent to the mobile station. This whole<br>
procedure of sending the PCCC or the PCCO message to the mobile station is guarded<br>
by a timer of 960 milliseconds. In other words, the network is given-960 milliseconds<br>
to respond with the PCCC-or PCCO message to. the mobile station,counting.from the<br>
time when the network"rcceivcsthe-PC6M:rnessage-fTomloejnobrtestation.<br>
[0003]             The problem is that if the.mobile station sends out the PCCN.message<br>
while the Count Down ("CV") is starting to decrement, meaning that very little data<br>
arc left to complete the data transmission between the mobile station and the serving<br>
station, the mobile station will, nevertheless, terminate the ongoing Temporary Block<br>
Flow (TBF") as soon as it receives the PCCC or PCCO message from the network.<br>
This is true even when the data transfer could have been finished in less than 960<br>
milliseconds. Similarly, in the downlink example, the mobile station could receive<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                         PCT/DS2005/045829<br>
the PCCC or PCCO message when the remaining data could have been transferred<br>
within the allowed time. So, instead of finishing the data transfer with the current<br>
serving cell, the mobile station starts the data transfer all over again by establishing a<br>
new TBF at the target cell to finish transferring the remaining data. Starting a new<br>
TBF is very inefficient, however, because it requires a significant amount of time,<br>
especially when the data transfer could have been finished in less than 960<br>
milliseconds. Another problem is that if the data transfer involves the Transmission<br>
Control Protocol ("TCP") layer that requires an acknowledgement ("ACK") packet,<br>
this ACK packet can be further delayed, because the mobile station is forced to leave<br>
the current cell and establish a new TBF in the target cell to finish the data transfer.<br>
This again is very efficient. Thus, for all these reasons, the overall data transfer rate<br>
of the mobile station is reduced, resulting in deterioration of mobile station overall<br>
performance.<br>

[0014]            Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are<br>
illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For<br>
example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated<br>
relative to other elements to help improve understanding of various embodiments of<br>
the present invention. Also, common and well-understood elements that are useful or<br>
necessary in a commercially feasible embodiment are often not depicted in order to<br>
facilitate a less obstructed view of these various embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0015]            Generally speaking, pursuant to these various embodiments,<br>
responsive to a reselection during a downlink data transmission, a determination is<br>
made as to whether remaining untransmitted data blocks of the downlink data<br>
transmission can be sent within an allowed transmission time. If so, the remaining<br>
untransmitted data blocks are transmitted to complete the downlink data transmission.<br>
If, however, the remaining untransmitted data blocks cannot be transmitted within the<br>
allowed transmission time, the communication link is terminated to stop the downlink<br>
data transmission with a serving station. In one embodiment, the reselection relates to<br>
a soft handover between the serving station and a target serving station. In another<br>
embodiment, a request is sent to drop the mobile station from the serving station<br>
responsive to the termination of the communication link. In various teachings, prior<br>
to the determination as to whether the remaining untransmitted data blocks can be<br>
sent within the allowed transmission time, it is determined whether a selected channel<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
coding scheme is currently available. If not, the communication link is terminated to<br>
stop the downlink data transmission with the serving station, which is followed by a<br>
request to drop the mobile station from the serving station being sent. If, on the other<br>
hand, the channel coding scheme is currently available, the remaining untransmitted<br>
data blocks are formatted to the selected channel coding scheme.<br>
[0016]            According to various teachings, data transmission management is<br>
further provided that, responsive to a reselection during a downlink data transmission,<br>
assesses the shortest transmission time needed to complete the downlink data<br>
transmission based on one or more current conditions. It is next determined whether<br>
the assessed shortest transmission time is greater than an allowed transmission time.<br>
If not, remaining untransmitted data blocks are sent to complete the downlink data<br>
transmission, and otherwise, the communication link is terminated to stop the<br>
downlink data transmission with the serving station. In one embodiment, the<br>
termination of the communication link also triggers a request to be sent that drops the<br>
mobile station from the serving station. In various embodiments, prior to the<br>
assessment of the shortest transmission time needed to complete the downlink data<br>
transmission, one or more currently available channel coding schemes are detected,<br>
and an available bandwidth for the downlink data transmission with the serving<br>
station is also assessed. According to a particular embodiment, the assessed shortest<br>
transmission time is based on one or more currently available channel coding schemes<br>
and/or the assessed bandwidth available for the downlink data transmission. In one<br>
embodiment, the remaining untransmitted data blocks are formatted according to the<br>
predefined current condition, which includes the available bandwidth and/or the<br>
available channel coding scheme.<br>
[0017]            According to various embodiments, an uplink data transmission<br>
management has also been provided that, responsive to a reselection during the uplink<br>
data transmission, makes a determination as to whether the uplink data transmission is<br>
in countdown, and if so, the shortest receive time needed to complete the uplink data<br>
transmission is assessed. Otherwise, the communication link is again terminated to<br>
stop the uplink data transmission with the serving station. In one embodiment, the<br>
assessment of the shortest receive time further includes a determination as to whether<br>
the assessed shortest receive time is greater than an allowed transmission time, and if<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
not, the remaining data blocks are received from the mobile station to complete the<br>
uplink data transmission. Otherwise, the communication link is terminated to stop the<br>
uplink data transmission with the serving station, which triggers a request to be sent to<br>
drop the mobile station from the mobile station according to one embodiment. In one<br>
embodiment, the reselection is a soft handover between the serving station and a<br>
target station. In another embodiment, the predefined throughput condition is based<br>
on a receiving radio frequency signal level or quality, a mobile sharing level, and an<br>
available coding scheme.<br>
[0018]            Through the teachings of various embodiments, an improved data<br>
transmission management technique has been provided that allows for more efficient<br>
data transfer during a mobile station reselection between a serving station and a target<br>
station. Because data transmissions that can be completed within the allowed<br>
transmission time are not unnecessarily terminated, unnecessary retransmission due to<br>
a reselection has been substantially eliminated. As a result, higher overall throughput<br>
of the system is provided. Moreover, the radio frequency conditions are changed<br>
dynamically to accommodate the cell change procedures, which further allows for a<br>
more efficient air time usage. Since the time needed to complete the data<br>
transmission is being assessed according to current conditions and/or historical data of<br>
the mobile station, a more accurate transfer time is provided to make an intelligent<br>
decision to either terminate or to complete the data transmission with the serving<br>
station. The various teachings also provide seamless integration into the existing<br>
systems because no standard changes are required with their implementation. Thus, a<br>
data transmission management has been provided that optimizes the overall<br>
throughput by improving, among other things, the procedure of data transmission<br>
responsive to a reselection.<br>
[0019]            Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1, for<br>
purposes of providing an illustrative but non-exhaustive example to facilitate this<br>
description, a specific operational paradigm using a Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication system ("UMTS") is shown and indicated generally at 100.<br>
Those skilled in the art, however, will recognize and appreciate that the specifics of<br>
this illustrative example are not specifics of the invention itself and that the teachings<br>
set forth herein are applicable in a variety of alternative settings. For example, since<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
the teachings described are not platform dependent, they can be applied to various<br>
systems, such as a General Packet Radio Service ("GPRS"), a Code Division Multiple<br>
Access ("CDMA") system, and/or a Time Division Multiple Access ("TDMA")<br>
system. In fact, any cellular networks are contemplated and are within the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
[0020]            Pursuant to this example, a typical UMTS deployment is shown that<br>
includes a mobile switching center ("MSC") 102 that is connected to a public<br>
switched telephone network ("PSTN") 104 and a GPRS Service Node ("GSN") 106<br>
that is connected to the Internet 108. The MSC 102 and the GSN 106 are respectively<br>
connected to a Base Station Controller ("BSC") 110 and a Packet Control Unit<br>
("PCU") 112, which are, in turn, connected to each other. The MSC 102 and the GSN<br>
106 are also connected to enable a mobile station ("MS") 114 to connect to the<br>
Internet 108. In particular, the MS 114 communicates with the Base Transceiver<br>
System ("BTSs") 116,118. The BTSs 116,118, in turn, communicate with the BSC<br>
110 that exchanges communications with either the MSC 102 or the PCU 112,<br>
depending on the type of information being transferred. Specifically, the MS 114 is<br>
communicating with the serving BTS 116, and a detection for reselection to the target<br>
BTS 118 is shown. Since the MSC 102 and the GSN 106 are connected with the two<br>
networks of the PSTN 104 or the Internet 108, the MS 114 has access to the cellular<br>
network through the BSC 110, the PSTN 104 through the MSC 102, and the Internet<br>
108 through the GSN 106, via the BTSs 116,118. The UMTS communication system<br>
100 shown is a typical exemplary structure of a cellular communication network that<br>
is suitable for various embodiments described.<br>
[0021]            Referring to FIG. 2, a call flow diagram of a cell change process<br>
between the PCU 112 and the MS 114 that is suitable for various embodiments is<br>
shown and indicated generally at 200. The call flow diagram illustrates the<br>
relationship between the MS 114 and the PCU 112. Although in practice the MS 114<br>
is not technically in direct communication with the PCU 112, it is commonly known<br>
in the art that the communication between them occurs through the use of the BTSs<br>
116,118 and BSC 110. For simplicity, however, the BTSs 116,118 and BSC 110 are<br>
excluded from the call flow diagram 200 to avoid confusion. Moreover, since the call<br>
flow diagram 200 is a specific implementation in the UTMS, the messages sent<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
between the PCU 112 and the MS may be different in other system implementations.<br>
The specifics of these other implementations are readily appreciated by one skilled in<br>
the art, and thus they are within the scope of the various teachings provided, even if<br>
they may not be shown.<br>
[0022]            As typically done in the UTMS, the MS 114 sends 202 a Packet Cell<br>
Change Notification ("PCCN") message to the PCU 112 responsive to a MS detection<br>
of a need to change from the serving BTS 116 to a target BTS 118. If the target BTS<br>
118 is known, one or more Packet Neighbor Cell Data ("PNCD") messages are sent<br>
204 back to the MS 114 from the PCU 112. After which, depending whether the<br>
target BTS 118 is or is not an optimal cell for the MS 112, either a Packet Cell<br>
Change Continue ("PCCC") that instructs the MS 114 to continue and connect to the<br>
target BTS 118 or a Packet Cell Change Order ("PCCO") message that instructs the<br>
MS to not connect to the target BTS is respectively sent 206 to the MS 112. In the<br>
UMTS, the time from when the PCU 112 received the PCCN message to the time<br>
when the PCU 112 actually sends the PCCC/PCCO is a block of time 208 where the<br>
various embodiments determine whether a data transfer can be executed within this<br>
given block of time.<br>
[0023]            In particular, according to one downlink embodiment, a logical link<br>
control ("LLC") boundary is detected 210 according to this block of time to determine<br>
whether the data transmission should be continued or terminated at the downlink of<br>
the PCU 112. An uplink embodiment, in contrast, makes an assessment 212 of a<br>
prediction of the uplink temporary block flow ("TBF") based on this block of time<br>
208 to determine whether to continue or terminate the receipt of data from the MS.<br>
Since this call flow diagram 200 is a specific implementation with the UMTS, 960<br>
milliseconds is the maximum allowed time for this block of time 208 according to the<br>
T3208 standard of the Network Assistant Cell Change procedure in the UMTS. Of<br>
course, the downlink detection and uplink prediction based on this time requirement<br>
of 960 milliseconds is one of the multiple embodiments contemplated. In fact, it<br>
should be noted that the various teachings described are not limited to the use of a<br>
time block. Rather, depending upon the system, one or more different parameters or<br>
different values of the parameter may also be chosen. As such, these other alternative<br>
embodiments are within the scope of the various teachings provided.<br>

WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
[0024]             Turning now to FIG. 3, a flow chart call diagram of a downlink data<br>
transmission process using current conditions of the mobile station according to an<br>
embodiment is shown and indicated generally at 300. It should be noted that although<br>
the processes described may be implemented at the PCU 112, the various teachings<br>
contemplate other implementations of different components in the system, such as the<br>
BSC 110 or the BTS 116. In fact, any component in the system can be used to fully<br>
or partially implement the various teachings described. As a result, as one skilled in<br>
the art can readily appreciate, any of the processes shown can be altered in multiple<br>
ways to achieve the same functions and/or results of the various teachings described.<br>
These processes shown are to be taken as one exemplary embodiment of multiple-<br>
variation embodiments that may not be specifically shown, and the other<br>
embodiments are within the scope of the various teachings described.<br>
[0025]             For this process 300, it preferably starts with a determination 304 as to<br>
whether a reselection is required at the MS 114, and the reselection refers to a soft<br>
handover between the serving BTS 116 and the target BTS 118 in one embodiment.<br>
If not, the process ends 306-until a reselection is required.. Upon a.reselcction<br>
requirement being detected 304. the process 300 next determines 308 whether data are<br>
actually being transmitted KKhe MS 114 during the reselection. If not, the process<br>
again ends 306. If, however, data are being transmitted to the MS 114 during the<br>

channel coding scheme is corrently availablc to omplete the transmission of<br>
remaining untransmitted dat to the.MS..If not,the.process terminates 312 the<br>
communication link between the serving BTS: 116 and the MS 114 in order to stop the<br>
data transmission to the MS. This is so.because without.the selected channel coding<br>

[0026]             If, however, the selected coding scheme is currently available, the<br>

determination of whether to complete the data transmission with the MS 114 is made<br>
based on the current condition of the channel conditions and/or throughput of the MS.<br>
The current conditions, as shown, include currently available code resources (e.g., the<br>
determination 310 as to whether a selected channel coding scheme is currently<br>
available) and the currently available throughput (e.g., the determination 314 as to<br>
whether the remaining untransmitted data blocks can be sent within the allowed time).<br>
Other current conditions, which are readily appreciated by a skilled artisan, can also<br>
be used, and the use of these different current conditions is dependent upon the<br>
standards of the system being implemented. Thus, other implementations of current<br>
conditions needed are within the scope of the various teachings described.<br>
[0027]            In the case when the remaining untransmitted data blocks cannot be<br>
sent within the allowed transmission, the communication link is again terminated 312<br>
because there is no point to continue the data transmission since it cannot be<br>
completed with the current serving BTS 116. If, in contrast, the remaining<br>
untransmitted data block can in fact be transmitted within the allowed transmission<br>
time, the remaining untransmitted data blocks are then formatted 316 in the selected<br>
channel coding scheme and sent 318 to the MS 114. The process accordingly sends<br>
320 a request to drop the MS from the serving BTS 116, which brings the process to<br>
the end 306.<br>
[0028]            Referring now to FIG. 4, a flow chart diagram of a downlink data<br>
transmission process using historical data of the mobile station is shown and indicated<br>
generally at 400. In this embodiment, the historical data of the mobile station is<br>
tracked in order to make a prediction as to whether the remaining untransmitted data<br>
can in fact be transmitted within the allowed time. In this embodiment, a plot of the<br>
MS's throughput is maintained over time, and using this information, the PCU can<br>
predict, at the current throughput rate, whether the current LLC frame can be sent to<br>
the MS within the allowed time. This process 400 shown similarly starts 402 with a<br>
determination 404 as to whether a reselection is required at the MS, and if not, the<br>
process accordingly ends 406. Otherwise, another determination 408 is made as to<br>
whether data are being transmitted, and again if not, the process simply ends 406. If,<br>
however, the MS is experiencing a reselection during a data transmission, one or more<br>
currently available channel coding schemes are detected 410, followed by an<br>

assessment of 412 of the bandwidth that is currently available for data transmission<br>
using the current serving BTS 116.<br>
[0029]            A shortest transmission time needed to complete the transmission of<br>
the remaining untransmitted data blocks is assessed 414 according to one or more<br>
predefined conditions. In this embodiment, the predefined conditions are based on the<br>
detected currently available channel coding scheme(s) available, the bandwidth<br>
available, and the historical data of the throughput of the MS. From this assessed<br>
shortest transmission time, it is determined 416 whether the shortest transmission time<br>
is greater than the allowed transmission time. If so, there is little point to continue the<br>
transmission since it cannot be completed with the current serving BTS 116, and the<br>
communication link between the serving BTS and the MS 114 is terminated 418,<br>
followed by a request to drop the MS 114 from the serving BTS 116 to be sent 420,<br>
which ends 406 the process.<br>
[0030]            On the other hand, if the shortest transmission time is not greater than<br>
the allowed transmission time, the remaining untransmitted data blocks will be<br>
formatted 422 according to the predefined conditions. In particular, in this<br>
embodiment, since there may be multiple coding schemes available at any given time,<br>
at least one or a combination of coding schemes are chosen to complete the data<br>
transmission, specifically a combination that provides for the shortest transmission<br>
time. The formatted data blocks are then accordingly sent 424 to complete the data<br>
transmission between the MS 114 and the serving BTS 116, and after which, the<br>
request to drop the MS is similarly sent 420, and the process ends 406 at this point.<br>
[0031]            Referring to FIG. 5, a flow chart diagram of an uplink data<br>
transmission process according to an embodiment is shown and indicated generally at<br>
500. The process also starts 502 with a determination 504 as to whether a reselection<br>
is required on the MS, and if not, the process ends 506. Otherwise, if so, another<br>
determination 508 is made as to whether an uplink data transfer is currently in<br>
countdown. Since the countdown is the standard for tracking an end of uplink data<br>
transfer in UTMS, it is used in this embodiment. Other standards, however, may be<br>
used, depending upon the system implementation. Those other standards are,<br>
nevertheless, within the scope of the various embodiments described.<br>
[0032]            In the case where the uplink data transfer is not in countdown, meaning<br>

WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
the uplink data transfer is not nearing the end, the communication link between the<br>
serving BTS 116 and the MS 114 is again terminated 510 because the serving BTS<br>
cannot receive the remaining untransmitted data from the mobile station within the<br>
allowed time. If, however, the uplink data transfer is in fact in countdown, a shortest<br>
receive time needed to finish the receipt of the remaining untransmitted data from the<br>
MS 114 is assessed 512. This assessed shortest receive time is then compared to<br>
determine 514 whether it is greater than the allowed receive time, and if so, the<br>
communication link is once again terminated 510. Otherwise, since the serving BTS<br>
can finish the uplink data transfer within the allowed transmission time, the remaining<br>
data blocks are received 516 from the MS 114 before a request is sent 518 to drop the<br>
MS from the serving BTS 116. After the drop message is sent 518, the process<br>
concludes 506 at this point.<br>
[0033]             Turning now to FIG. 6, a flow chart diagram of a downlink data<br>
transmission process implemented on a UMTS using current conditions of the MS<br>
114 is shown and indicated generally at 600. Since the various embodiments relate to<br>
a data transmission during a reselection, the process starts 602 with a determination<br>
604 as to whether a reselection is required at the MS 114, and if not, the process ends<br>
606. Otherwise, in this particular embodiment shown, a determination 608 is made<br>
based on the formula<br><br>
where "Sizeof(current_LLC_PDU_left)" refers to the size of the size of the remaining<br>
untransmitted data, the constant "52" is based on the coding scheme 4 ("CS4")<br>
standard of the UMTS, "20ms" refers to a predefined time block for the execution of<br>
the process, "T" refers to the allowed transmission time, and "x" refers to the time<br>
adjustment to allow receipt of the acknowledgement packet for the LLC frame. If the<br>
determination 608 is true, meaning the remaining untransmitted data in CS4 blocks<br>
can be transmitted within the allowed time, the current Radio Link Control ("RLC") is<br>
sent 610 in CS4 blocks to the MS 114 followed by the PCCC or the PCCO message<br>
being sent as a response to the reselection requirement of the MS. Put differently, the<br>
remaining untransmitted data blocks on the RLC are sent in CS4 blocks to the MS,<br>
after which the PCCC or the PCCO message is sent to the MS. The process further<br>

sends 612 a request to drop the MS 114 from the serving BTS, which brings the<br>
process to the end 606.<br>
[0034]           If, however, the determination 608 is false, another determination 614<br>
is made based on the formula<br><br>
where "Sizeof(current_LLC_PDU_left)" refers to the size of the remaining<br>
untransmitted data, the constant "38" is based on the coding scheme 3 ("CS3")<br>
standard of the UMTS, "20ms" refers to a predefined time block for the execution of<br>
the process, "T" refers to the allowed transmission time, and "x" refers to the time<br>
adjustment to allow receipt of the acknowledgement packet for the LLC frame. If the<br>
determination 614 is true, meaning the remaining untransmitted data in CS3 blocks<br>
can be transmitted within the allowed time, the current RLC is sent 616 in CS3 blocks<br>
to the MS 114 followed by the sending of the PCCC or the PCCO. The process<br>
continues to send 612 a request to drop the MS 114 from the serving BTS 116, and<br>
the process ends 606.<br>
[0035]            If, on the other hand, the determination 614 is also false, another<br>
determination 618 is made based on the formula<br><br>
where "Sizeof(current_LLC_PDU_left)M refers to the size of the remaining<br>
untransmitted data, the constant "32" is based on the coding scheme 2 ("CS2")<br>
standard of the UMTS, "20ms" refers to a predefined time block for the execution of<br>
the process, "T" refers to the allowed transmission time, and "x" refers to the time<br>
adjustment to allow receipt of the acknowledgement packet for the LLC frame. If the<br>
determination 618 is true, meaning the remaining untransmitted data in CS2 blocks<br>
can be transmitted within the allowed time, the current RLC is sent 616 in CS2 blocks<br>
to the MS 114 followed by the sending of the PCCC or the PCCO. The process again<br>
sends 612 the request to drop the MS 114 from the serving BTS 116, and the process<br>
ends 606.<br>
[0036]            If the determination 618 is false, in this case all the available coding<br>
schemes have been checked for the data transmission and no coding scheme resource<br>

is suitable. The communication link, specifically the IXC, between the MS 114 and<br>
the serving BTS 116 will be terminated 622 because the MS is experiencing bad<br>
conditions with the serving BTS. The request to drop the MS from the serving BTS is<br>
again sent 612 after the LLC has been terminated, which brings the process to the end<br>
606.<br>
[0037]            Referring now to FIG. 7, an exemplary plot of the historical data of the<br>
mobile station used according to an embodiment is shown and indicated generally at<br>
700. For embodiments of the downlink detection of the LLC boundary, the historical<br>
data plot is maintained that tracks the throughput of the MS over a period of time.<br>
Using this information along with the minimum received power level required by the<br>
mobile station to access the cell ("rxlev access min") of the serving BTS 116, the PCU<br>
could predict whether the remaining untransmitted data can be sent within the allowed<br>
transmission time. As shown, specifically, the throughput 702 of the MS 114 is<br>
plotted over a period of time 704 to generate a slope 706 as an example. The<br>
detection process 708 of the downlink LLC using the historical data plot may be<br>
implemented at a starting point 710 when detected that a serving cell received power<br>
level ("rxlev") is less than the rxlev access min and an ending point 712, and when<br>
detected that the serving cell rxlev is greater than the rxlev access min. From this<br>
historical data plot 700, the detection process is dynamically triggered, and one<br>
embodiment of a detection process is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
[0038]           FIG. 8 shows a flow chart diagram 800 of the downlink data<br>
transmission process implemented on a UMTS using historical data of the MS, such<br>
as the one shown in FIG. 7. This process 800 starts 802 with a determination 804 as<br>
to whether a reselection is required, and if not, the process ends 806. Otherwise, in<br>
this embodiment, a determination 808 is made based on the formula<br><br>
where "Sizeof(current__LLC_PDU_left)" refers to the size of the remaining<br>
untransmitted data,<br>

the size of the remaining untransmitted data in Code Scheme 4 ("CS4) blocks, "0.96"<br>

receipt of the acknowledgement packet for the LLC frame. If the determination 808<br>
is false, meaning the remaining untransmitted data in CS4 blocks can be transmitted<br>
within the allowed time, the current RLC is sent 810 in CS4 blocks to the MS 114<br>
followed by the sending of the PCCC or the PCCO. The process continues to send<br>
812 a request to drop the MS 114 from the serving BTS 116, and the process ends<br>
806.<br>
[0039]            If, however, determination 808 is true, meaning the remaining<br>
untransmitted data cannot be sent in CS4 within the allowed time, a next<br>
determination 814 is made for Code Scheme 3 ("CS3") based on the formula<br><br>
where "Sizeof(current_LLC_PDU_left)" refers to the size of the remaining<br>
untransmitted data, "current_calculated_throughput" refers to the current throughput<br>
of the communication link between the MS 114 and the serving BTS 116, "20ms"<br>
refers to a predefined time block for the execution of the process,<br>
"size_pf_CS3_block" refers to the size of the remaining untransmitted data in CS3<br>
blocks, "0.96" refers to the allowed transmission time, and "x" refers to the time<br>
adjustment to allow receipt of the acknowledgement packet for the LLC frame. If the<br>
determination 814 is false, meaning the remaining untransmitted data in CS3 blocks<br>
can be transmitted within the allowed time, the current RLC is accordingly sent 816 in<br>
CS3 blocks to the MS 114 followed by the sending of the PCCC or the PCCO<br>
message. The process continues to send 812 the request to drop the MS 114 from the<br>
serving BTS 116, and the process ends 806.<br>
[0040]            If the determination 814 is true, a next determination 818 is made<br>

determination 818 is false, meaning the remaining untransmitted data in CS2 blocks<br>
can be transmitted within the allowed time, the current RLC is sent 820 in CS2 blocks<br>
to the MS 114 followed by the sending of the PCCC or the PCCO. The process<br>
continues to send 812 a request to drop the MS 114 from the serving BTS 116, and<br>
the process ends 806.<br>
[0041]            If, however, the determination 818 is true, in this case all the available<br>
coding schemes have been checked for the data transmission and no coding scheme<br>
resource is suitable. The communication link, specifically the LLC, between the MS<br>
114 and the serving BTS 116 will be terminated 822 because the MS is experiencing<br>
bad conditions with the serving BTS. The request to drop the MS 114 from the<br>
serving BTS 116 is again sent 812 after the LLC has been terminated, which brings<br>
the process to the end 806.<br>
[0042]            Referring to FIG. 9, a flow chart diagram of an uplink data<br>
transmission process implemented on a UMTS according to an embodiment is shown<br>
and indicated generally at 900. This process relates to the uplink of the PCU 112<br>
where a prediction is made to determine whether the remaining untransmitted data can<br>
be received from the MS 114 within the allowed transmission time. In this process, it<br>
is similarly initiated 902 with a reselection requirement determination 904, and if<br>
reselection is not required, the process ends 906. On the other hand, if reselection is<br>
required, it is determined 908 whether the uplink temporary block flow ("TBF") is<br>
currently in a counting down state. If not, meaning the data transfer from the MS 116<br>
is not near the end, the ongoing uplink and downlink TBF are then terminated 910,<br>
which triggers a PCCC or a PCCO message 912 to drop the MS from the serving BTS<br>
116. If, however, the uplink TBF is counting down, a determination 914 is made<br>
based on the formula<br><br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
untransmitted data, "current_UL_throughput" refers to the current throughput of the<br>
uplink channel, and "960ms" refers to the allowed transmission time standard of the<br>
UMTS. If the determination 914 is false, meaning the remaining untransmitted data<br>
can be received from the MS 114 within the allowed transmission time of 960<br>
milliseconds, the process continues to receive 916 the remaining untransmitted data<br>
blocks from the MS 116. After the data transfer from the MS 114 is completed, the<br>
process sends 912 the PCCC or PCCO message to drop the MS from the serving BTS<br>
116, which brings the process to the end 906. On the other hand, if the determination<br>
914 is true, meaning that the remaining transmitted data cannot be received within the<br>
allowed transmission time, the ongoing uplink and downlink TBF would then be<br>
terminated 910, followed by the PCCC or PCCO message being sent 912, which<br>
concludes 906 the process at this point.<br>
[0043]            With these various teachings shown, a novel data transmission<br>
management technique has been provided that more efficiently completes or<br>
terminates existing data transfer during a MS reselection. In particular, since existing<br>
data transmissions are not unnecessarily terminated when they can be in fact<br>
efficiently completed before the reselection, unnecessary retransmissions due to<br>
reselection have been substantially reduced and/or eliminated. As such, the result is<br>
higher overall throughput. Furthermore, because the radio frequency conditions are<br>
being changed dynamically to accommodate the cell change procedures, a more<br>
efficient air time usage is provided. With the assessment of an estimated time needed<br>
to finish the data transfer that is based on current conditions and/or historical data of<br>
the MS, more accurate transfer time assessment is provided in order to make an<br>
intelligent decision as to whether to terminate or complete the transmission. As a<br>
result, a data transmission management has been provided that optimizes the overall<br>
throughput by various improvements of the cell change procedures.<br>
[0044]            Those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of<br>
modifications, alterations, and combinations can be made with respect to the above<br>
described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention,<br>
and that such modifications, alterations, and combinations are to be viewed as being<br>
within the ambit of the inventive concept.<br>

8.         A method of managing an uplink data transmission between a mobile<br>
station and a serving station via a communication link comprising:<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2006/073764                                                                                          PCT/US2005/045829<br>
determining whether the uplink data transmission is in countdown<br>
responsive to a reselection during the uplink data transmission;<br>
assessing a shortest receive time needed to complete the uplink data<br>
transmission according to at least one predefined throughput condition when the<br>
uplink data transmission is in countdown;<br>
terminating the communication link to stop the uplink data<br>
transmission with the serving station when the uplink data transmission is not in<br>
countdown.<br>
9.         The method according to claim 8 wherein assessing the shortest<br>
receiving time further comprises:<br>
determining whether assessed shortest receive time is greater than an<br>
allowed transmission time;<br>
terminating the communication link to stop the uplink data<br>
transmission with the serving station when the assessed shortest receiving time is<br>
greater than the allowed transmission time;<br>
receiving the remaining data blocks from the mobile station to<br>
complete the uplink data transmission when the assessed shortest receive time is not<br>
greater than the allowed transmission time.<br>
10.       The method according to claim 8 further comprising:<br>
sending a request to drop the mobile station from the serving station<br>
responsive to terminating the communication link to stop the uplink data transmission<br>
with the serving station.<br>
-19-<br><br>
In the present technique of a data transmission<br>
management, responsive to a reselection during a data<br>
transmission, a determination (314, 514) is made as to whether<br>
remaining untransmitted data blocks of the data transmission<br>
can be sent within an allowed transmission time. If so, the<br>
remaining untransmitted data blocks are transmitted (318,<br>
518) to complete the data transmission. If, however, the<br>
remaining untransmitted data blocks cannot be transmitted<br>
within the allowed transmission time, the communication link<br>
is terminated (312, 510) to stop the downlink data transmission<br>
with a serving station.</td>
