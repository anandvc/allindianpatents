TRIAZINE DERIVATIVES AS UV ABSORBERS Triazinc Dcrivativcs-<br>
The present invention relates to anisyl-bis(arylamino)-triazines, to the preparation of these compounds and to their use as UV absorbers in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Depending on their wavelength, UV rays are divided in UV-A rays (320 - 400 nm) and UV-B rays (280-320 nm). The harmful effect, in particular the occurrence of sunburn (erythema), increases not only with the duration of exposure but also with decreasing wavelength and is thus significantly more strongly marked in the case of UV-B radiation than in the case of UV-A radiation. Since erythemas can occur even after short exposure to the sun, in some cases after 20-30 minutes, efficient protection against this radiation is of particular importance.<br>
Ultra violet light absorbing compounds (UV-absorbers) do not absorb the complete spectrum of ultra violet light to the same extent at each wavelength. Characteristics of UV-absorbers are therefore the wavelength at which absorption is largest (in nm), and the absorption percentage at this wavelength (relative, calculated using the law of Lambert-Beer). Both this wavelength and absorption percentage at maximum absorbency can be influenced by other components present together with the UV-absorber.<br>
It was now found that specific anisyl-bis(arylamino)-triazines are very effective UV absorbers.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to compounds of formula<br><br><br>
0)<br><br>
R„ R2&gt; Rv R4/ K R6' R7 ancl Ra independently from each other are hydrogen; C,-C18alkyl; C2-Ciaalkenyl; Cs-C7cycloalkyl; or CrC6alkylene-CrC7cycloalkyl;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, for example dioxan.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably from50 to 100°C, more preferably from 60 to 90°C<br>
The obtained reaction product is purified by conventional methods, such as for example recrystallisation.<br>
The compounds of the formula (1) according to the present invention are particularly suitable as UV filters, i.e. for protecting ultraviolet-sensitive organic materials, in particular the skin and hair of humans and animals, from the harmful effects of UV radiation. These compounds are therefore suitable as sunscreens in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary medical preparations. These compounds can be used both in dissolved form and in the micronized state.<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved<br>
state (soluble organic filters, solubelized organic filters) or in the micronised state (nanoscalar<br>
organic filters, particulate organic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br>
Any known process suitable for the preparation of microparticles can be used for the<br>
preparation of the micronised UV absorbers, for example:<br>
wet-milling (low viscous micronisation process for pump-able dispersions), with a hard grinding medium, for example zirconium silicate balls in a ball mill and a protective surfactant or a protective polymer in water or in a suitable organic solvent; wet-kneading (high viscous micronisation process non pump-able pastes) using a continuous or discontinuous (batch) kneader. For a wet-kneading process a solvent (water or cosmetically acceptable oils), a grinding-aid (surfactant, emulsifier) and a polymeric grinding aid may be used. Both processes may be used respectively<br>
spray-drying from a suitable solvent, for example aqueous suspensions or suspensions containing organic solvents, or true solutions in water, ethanol, dichloroethane, toluene or N-methylpyrrolidone etc..<br>
by the expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) of supercritical fluids (e.g. COa) in which the UV filter or filters is/are dissolved,<br><br>
or the expansion of fluid carbon dioxide together with a solution of one or more UV filters in a suitable organic solvent;<br>
by reprecipitation from suitable solvents, including supercritical fluids (CASR process = Qas Anti-Solvent Eecrystallisation / PCA process = Precipitation with Compressed Anti-solvents).<br>
As milling apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers there may be used, for example, a jet mill, ball mill, vibratory mill or hammer mill, preferably a highspeed mixing mill. Even more preferably mills are modem ball mills, manufactures of these mill-types are for example Netzsch (LMZ-mill), Drais (DCP-viscoflow or cosmo), Buhler AC (centrifugal mills) or Bachhofer. The grinding is preferably carried out with a grinding aid. As kneading apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers examples are typical sigma-hook batch kneaders but also serial batch kneaders (lKA-Werke) or continuous kneaders (Contiuna from Werner und Pfleiderer).<br>
Useful low molecular weight grinding aids for all the above micronizing processes are surfactants and emulsifies as disclosed below in the chapters "emulsifiers" and "surfactants*.<br>
Useful polymeric grinding aids for water dispersion are cosmetically acceptable water soluble Polymers with Mw &gt; 5000 g/mol for example: Acrylates (Salcare types), modified or non-modified polysaccharides, polyglucosides or xanthan gum. Furthermore an alkylated vinylpyrrolidone polymer, a vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer, an acyl glutamate, an alkyl polyglucoside, ceteareth-25 or a phospholipid may be used. Oil dispersions may contain cosmetically acceptable waxy polymers or natural waxes as polymeric grinding aid to adjust viscosity during and after processing.<br>
Useful solvents are water, brine, (poly-)ethylenglycol or glycerine for water-soluble dispersions and also cosmetically acceptable oils like described under "emollients" for oil-soluble dispersions.<br>
The micronised UV absorbers so obtained usually have an average particle size from 0.02 to 2 micrometer, preferably from 0.05 to 1.5 micrometer and more especially from 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer.<br><br>
The UV absorbers can also be used dry in powder form. For that purpose the UV absorbers are subjected to known grinding methods, such as vacuum atomization, countercurrent spray-drying etc.. Such powders have a particle size of from 0.1 micrometer to 2 micrometer. To avoid the occurrence of agglomeration, the UV absorbers can be coated with a surface-active compound prior to the pulverisation process, for example with an anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactant, e.g. a phospholipid or a known polymer, such as PVP, an acrylate etc.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can also contain one or more than one further UV filter as described in table 1-3.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by physically mixing the UV absorber(s) with the adjuvant using customary methods, for example by simply stirring together the individual components, especially by making use of the dissolution properties of already known cosmetic UV absorbers, for example octyl methoxy cinnamate, salicylic acid isooctyl ester, etc. The UV absorber can be used, for example, without further treatment, or in the micronised state, or in the form of a powder.<br>
Cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations contain from 0.05-40% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one UV absorber or UV absorber mixtures.<br>
Preference is given to the use of mixing ratios of the UV absorber of formula (1) according to the invention and optionally further light-protective agents (as described in table 1-3) from 1:99 to 99:1, especially from 1:95 to 95:1 and preferably from 10:90 to 90:10, based on weight. Of special interest are mixing ratios of from 20:80 to 80:20, especially from 40:60 to 60:40 and preferably approximately 50:50. Such mixtures can be used, inter alia, to improve solubility or increase UV absorption.<br>
The UV absorbers of formula (1) according to the present invention or combinations of UV filters are useful to protect skin, hair and/or natural or artificial hair color.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Suitable UV filter substances which can be additionally used with the UV absorbers according to the present invention are any UV-A and UV-B filter substances.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, alcoholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or microemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adjuvants.<br>

Holosphere additives (Sunspheres® ISP, Silica Shells Kobo.) deflect radiation and the effective path length of the photon is therefore increased.( EP0893119). Some beads, as mentioned previously, provide a soft feel during spreading. Moreover, the optical activity of such beads, e.g.Micropearl M305, cans modulate skin shine by eliminating reflection phenomena and indirectly may scatter the UV light. When formulated in O/W emulsions, the preferably amount of such SPF enhancers should represent 1% to 10% of the total amount of the emulsion.<br>

TRIAZINE DERIVATIVES AS UV ABSORBERS Triazinc Dcrivativcs-<br>
The present invention relates to anisyl-bis(arylamino)-triazines, to the preparation of these compounds and to their use as UV absorbers in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Depending on their wavelength, UV rays are divided in UV-A rays (320 - 400 nm) and UV-B rays (280-320 nm). The harmful effect, in particular the occurrence of sunburn (erythema), increases not only with the duration of exposure but also with decreasing wavelength and is thus significantly more strongly marked in the case of UV-B radiation than in the case of UV-A radiation. Since erythemas can occur even after short exposure to the sun, in some cases after 20-30 minutes, efficient protection against this radiation is of particular importance.<br>
Ultra violet light absorbing compounds (UV-absorbers) do not absorb the complete spectrum of ultra violet light to the same extent at each wavelength. Characteristics of UV-absorbers are therefore the wavelength at which absorption is largest (in nm), and the absorption percentage at this wavelength (relative, calculated using the law of Lambert-Beer). Both this wavelength and absorption percentage at maximum absorbency can be influenced by other components present together with the UV-absorber.<br>
It was now found that specific anisyl-bis(arylamino)-triazines are very effective UV absorbers.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to compounds of formula<br><br><br>
0)<br><br>
R„ R2&gt; Rv R4/ K R6' R7 ancl Ra independently from each other are hydrogen; C,-C18alkyl; C2-Ciaalkenyl; Cs-C7cycloalkyl; or CrC6alkylene-CrC7cycloalkyl;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, for example dioxan.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably from50 to 100°C, more preferably from 60 to 90°C<br>
The obtained reaction product is purified by conventional methods, such as for example recrystallisation.<br>
The compounds of the formula (1) according to the present invention are particularly suitable as UV filters, i.e. for protecting ultraviolet-sensitive organic materials, in particular the skin and hair of humans and animals, from the harmful effects of UV radiation. These compounds are therefore suitable as sunscreens in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary medical preparations. These compounds can be used both in dissolved form and in the micronized state.<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved<br>
state (soluble organic filters, solubelized organic filters) or in the micronised state (nanoscalar<br>
organic filters, particulate organic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br>
Any known process suitable for the preparation of microparticles can be used for the<br>
preparation of the micronised UV absorbers, for example:<br>
wet-milling (low viscous micronisation process for pump-able dispersions), with a hard grinding medium, for example zirconium silicate balls in a ball mill and a protective surfactant or a protective polymer in water or in a suitable organic solvent; wet-kneading (high viscous micronisation process non pump-able pastes) using a continuous or discontinuous (batch) kneader. For a wet-kneading process a solvent (water or cosmetically acceptable oils), a grinding-aid (surfactant, emulsifier) and a polymeric grinding aid may be used. Both processes may be used respectively<br>
spray-drying from a suitable solvent, for example aqueous suspensions or suspensions containing organic solvents, or true solutions in water, ethanol, dichloroethane, toluene or N-methylpyrrolidone etc..<br>
by the expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) of supercritical fluids (e.g. COa) in which the UV filter or filters is/are dissolved,<br><br>
or the expansion of fluid carbon dioxide together with a solution of one or more UV filters in a suitable organic solvent;<br>
by reprecipitation from suitable solvents, including supercritical fluids (CASR process = Qas Anti-Solvent Eecrystallisation / PCA process = Precipitation with Compressed Anti-solvents).<br>
As milling apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers there may be used, for example, a jet mill, ball mill, vibratory mill or hammer mill, preferably a highspeed mixing mill. Even more preferably mills are modem ball mills, manufactures of these mill-types are for example Netzsch (LMZ-mill), Drais (DCP-viscoflow or cosmo), Buhler AC (centrifugal mills) or Bachhofer. The grinding is preferably carried out with a grinding aid. As kneading apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers examples are typical sigma-hook batch kneaders but also serial batch kneaders (lKA-Werke) or continuous kneaders (Contiuna from Werner und Pfleiderer).<br>
Useful low molecular weight grinding aids for all the above micronizing processes are surfactants and emulsifies as disclosed below in the chapters "emulsifiers" and "surfactants*.<br>
Useful polymeric grinding aids for water dispersion are cosmetically acceptable water soluble Polymers with Mw &gt; 5000 g/mol for example: Acrylates (Salcare types), modified or non-modified polysaccharides, polyglucosides or xanthan gum. Furthermore an alkylated vinylpyrrolidone polymer, a vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer, an acyl glutamate, an alkyl polyglucoside, ceteareth-25 or a phospholipid may be used. Oil dispersions may contain cosmetically acceptable waxy polymers or natural waxes as polymeric grinding aid to adjust viscosity during and after processing.<br>
Useful solvents are water, brine, (poly-)ethylenglycol or glycerine for water-soluble dispersions and also cosmetically acceptable oils like described under "emollients" for oil-soluble dispersions.<br>
The micronised UV absorbers so obtained usually have an average particle size from 0.02 to 2 micrometer, preferably from 0.05 to 1.5 micrometer and more especially from 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer.<br><br>
The UV absorbers can also be used dry in powder form. For that purpose the UV absorbers are subjected to known grinding methods, such as vacuum atomization, countercurrent spray-drying etc.. Such powders have a particle size of from 0.1 micrometer to 2 micrometer. To avoid the occurrence of agglomeration, the UV absorbers can be coated with a surface-active compound prior to the pulverisation process, for example with an anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactant, e.g. a phospholipid or a known polymer, such as PVP, an acrylate etc.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can also contain one or more than one further UV filter as described in table 1-3.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by physically mixing the UV absorber(s) with the adjuvant using customary methods, for example by simply stirring together the individual components, especially by making use of the dissolution properties of already known cosmetic UV absorbers, for example octyl methoxy cinnamate, salicylic acid isooctyl ester, etc. The UV absorber can be used, for example, without further treatment, or in the micronised state, or in the form of a powder.<br>
Cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations contain from 0.05-40% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one UV absorber or UV absorber mixtures.<br>
Preference is given to the use of mixing ratios of the UV absorber of formula (1) according to the invention and optionally further light-protective agents (as described in table 1-3) from 1:99 to 99:1, especially from 1:95 to 95:1 and preferably from 10:90 to 90:10, based on weight. Of special interest are mixing ratios of from 20:80 to 80:20, especially from 40:60 to 60:40 and preferably approximately 50:50. Such mixtures can be used, inter alia, to improve solubility or increase UV absorption.<br>
The UV absorbers of formula (1) according to the present invention or combinations of UV filters are useful to protect skin, hair and/or natural or artificial hair color.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Suitable UV filter substances which can be additionally used with the UV absorbers according to the present invention are any UV-A and UV-B filter substances.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, alcoholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or microemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adjuvants.<br>

Deodorising active ingredients<br>
As deodorising active ingredients there come into consideration, for example, anti-perspirants, for example aluminium chlorohydrates (see J, Soc. Cosm. Chem. 24, 281 (1973)). Under the trade mark Locron* of Hoechst AG, Frankfurt (FRG), there is available commercially, for example, an aluminium chlorohydrate corresponding to formula Al2(OH)5CI x 2.5 H20, the use of which is especially preferred (see J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 26, 531 (1975)). Besides the chlorohydrates, it is also possible to use aluminium hydroxyacetates and acidic aluminium/zirconium salts. Esterase inhibitors may be added as further deodorising active ingredients. Such inhibitors are preferably trialkyl citrates, such as trimethyl citrate, tripropyl citrate, triisopropyl citrate, tributyl citrate and especially triethyl citrate (Hydagen CAT, Henkel), which inhibit enzyme activity and hence reduce odour formation. Further substances that come into consideration as esterase inhibitors are sterol sulfates or phosphates, for example lanosterol, cholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol sulfate or phosphate, dicarboxylic acids and esters thereof, for example glutaric acid, glutaric acid monoethyl ester, glutaric acid diethyl ester, adipic acid, adipic acid monoethyl ester, adipic acid diethyl ester, malonic acid and malonic acid diethyl ester and hydroxycarboxylic acids and esters thereof, for example citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid or tartaric acid diethyl ester.

Hydrotropic agents<br>
To improve the flow behaviour it is also possible to employ hydrotropic agents, for example ethoxylated or non ethoxylated mono-alcohols, diols or polyols with a low number of carbon atoms or their ethers (e.g. ethanol, isopropanol, 1,2-dipropanediol, propyleneglycol, glyerin, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoethylether, ethylene glycol monobutylether, propylene glycol monomethylether, propylene glycol monoethylether, propylene glycol monobutylether, diethylene glycol monomethylether; diethylene glycol monoethylether, diethylene glycol monobutylether and similar products). The polyols that come into consideration for that purpose have preferably from 2 to 15 carbon atoms and at least two hydroxy groups. The polyols may also contain further functional groups, especially amino groups, and/or may be modified with nitrogen. Typical examples are as follows: glycerol, alkylene glycols, for example ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, hexylene glycol and also polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of from 100 to 1000 Dalton; technical oligoglycerol mixtures having an intrinsic degree of condensation of from 1.5 to 10, for example technical diglycerol mixtures having a diglycerol content of from 40 to 50 % by weight; methylol compounds, such as, especially, trimethylolethane, trimethylol-propane, trimethylolbutane, pentaerythritol and dipentaerythritol; lower alkyl-glucosides, especially those having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, for example methyl and butyl glucoside; sugar alcohols having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms, for example sorbitol or mannitol; sugars having from 5 to 12 carbon atoms, for example glucose or saccharose; amino sugars, for example glucamine; dialcohol amines, such as diethanolamine or 2-amino-1,3-propanediol.<br>

Bacteria-inhibiting agents<br>
Typical examples of bacteria-inhibiting agents are preservatives that have a specific action against gram-positive bacteria, such as 2,4,4,-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether, chlorhexi-dine (1,6-di(4-chlorophenyl-biguanido)hexane) orTCC (3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide). A large number of aromatic substances and ethereal oils also have antimicrobial properties. Typical examples are the active ingredients eugenol, menthol and thymol in clove oil, mint oil and thyme oil, A natural deodorising agent of interest is the terpene alcohol farnesol (3,7,11-tri-methyl-2,6,10-dodecatrien-1-ol), which is present in lime blossom oil. Glycerol monolaurate has also proved to be a bacteriostatic agent The amount of the additional bacteria-inhibiting agents present is usually from 0.1 to 2 % by weight, based on the solids content of the preparations.<br>
Perfume oils<br>
There may be mentioned as perfume oils mixtures of natural and/or synthetic aromatic substances. Natural aromatic substances are, for example, extracts from blossom (lilies, lavender, roses, jasmine, neroli, ylang-ylang), from stems and leaves (geranium, patchouli, petitgrain), from fruit (aniseed, coriander, carraway, juniper), from fruit peel (bergamot, lemons, oranges), from roots (mace, angelica, celery, cardamom, costus, iris, calmus), from wood (pine-wood, sandalwood, guaiacum wood, cedarwood, rosewood), from herbs and grasses (tarragon, lemon grass, sage, thyme), from needles and twigs (spruce, pine, Scots pine, mountain pine), from resins and balsams (galbanum, elemi, benzoin, myrrh, olibanum, opoponax). Animal raw materials also come into consideration, for example civet and castoreum.

The colourants are usually used in concentrations of from 0.001 to 0.1 % by weight, based on the total mixture.<br>
Other adjuvants<br>
It is furthermore possible for the cosmetic preparations to contain, as adjuvants, anti-foams, such as silicones, structurants, such as maleic acid, solubilisers, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol or diethylene glycol, opacifies, such as latex, styrene/PVP or sty-rene/acrylamide copolymers, complexing agents, such as EDTA, NTA, alaninediacetic acid or phosphonic acids, propellants, such as propane/butane mixtures, N20, dimethyl ether, C02, N2 or air, so-called coupler and developer components as oxidation dye precursors, reducing agents, such as thioglycolic acid and derivatives thereof, thiolactic acid, cysteamine, thio-malic acid or mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, or oxidising agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, potassium bromate or sodium bromate.<br><br>
Suitable insect repellents are, for example, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, 1,2-pentanedioI or insect repellent 3535; suitable self-tanning agents are, for example, dihydroxyacetone and/or erythrulose or dihydroxy acetone and/or dihydroxy acetone precursors as described in WO 01/85124 and/or erythrulose.<br>
Polymeric beads or hollow spheres as SPF enhancers<br>
The combination of the UV-absorbers and UV-absorber combinations, listed above, with SPF enhancers, such as non-active ingredients like Styrene/acrylates copolymer, silica beads, spheroidal magnesium silicate, crosslinked Polymethylmethacrylates (PMMA; Micopearl M305 Seppic), can maximize better the UV protection of the sun products. Holosphere additives (Sunspheres® ISP, Silica Shells Kobo.) deflect radiation and the effective path length of the photon is therefore increased.( EP0893119). Some beads, as mentioned previously, provide a soft feel during spreading. Moreover, the optical activity of such beads, e.g.Micropearl M305, cans modulate skin shine by eliminating reflection phenomena and indirectly may scatter the UV light. When formulated in O/W emulsions, the preferably amount of such SPF enhancers should represent 1% to 10% of the total amount of the emulsion.<br>
