				<td>1-(AMINOALKYL)-3-SULFONYLAZAINDOLES-AS COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to 1-(aminoalkyl)-3-suffonylazaindoles useful as 5-<br>
hydroxytryptamine-6 ligands, to processes for preparing them, to methods of<br>
treatment using them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine)(5-HT) receptors play a critical role in many<br>
physiological and behavioral functions in humans and animals. These functions are<br>
mediated through various 5-HT receptors distributed throughout the body. There are<br>
now approximately fifteen different human 5-HT receptor subtypes that have been<br>
cloned, many with well-defined roles in humans. One of the most recently identified<br>
5-HT receptor subtypes is the 5-HT6 receptor, first cloned from rat tissue in 1993<br>
(Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hambiin, M. W. Molecular Pharmacology<br>
1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.;<br>
Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R. Journal of Neurochemistry 1996, 66,<br>
47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to<br>
adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L; Diaz,<br>
L; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C. Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications<br>
1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous<br>
system (CNS) areas both in rat and in human. In situ hybridization studies of the<br>
5-HT6 receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of<br>
5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and<br>
hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hambiin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B.<br>
J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M. Neuroscience 1995, 64, 1105-1111).<br>
There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT6 ligands in humans<br>
based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These<br><br>
studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in<br>
vivo activity, and various animal studies conducted so far.<br>
One potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT6 receptor function is in<br>
the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as<br>
Alzheimer"sThe high levels of receptor found in important structures in the forebrain,<br>
including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex<br>
suggest a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known<br>
to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M.-P.; Lefevre, K.; Miquel, M.C.;<br>
Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; El Mestikawy, S. Brain Research,<br>
1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT6 receptor ligands to enhance<br>
cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C.;<br>
Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J.<br>
British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999,126(7), 1537-1542). Studies have found that<br>
a known 5-HT6 selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate<br>
levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, or 5-<br>
HT. This selective elevation of neurochemicals known to be involved in memory and<br>
cognition strongly suggests a role for 5-HT6 ligands in cognition (Dawson, L A.;<br>
Nguyen, H. Q.; U, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000,130(1), 23-26). Animal<br>
studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT6 antagonist found some<br>
positive effects (Rogers, D. C; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neurosdence,<br>
Abstracts 2000,26,680).<br>
A related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT6 ligands is the treatment of<br>
attentionjdeficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactiyjty<br>
Disorder or ADHD) in both children and adults. Because 5-HT6 antagonists appear<br>
to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and because ADHD<br>
has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik,<br>
J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M. Journal of Neurosdence 1998,18(15), 5901-5907),<br>
5-HT6 antagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.<br>
Early studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known<br>
therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role<br>
for 5-HT6 ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example,<br>
clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor<br>
subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as<br><br>
well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P. Annual<br>
Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology 2000, 40, 319-334).<br>
Further, recent in vivo studies in rats indicate 5-HT6 modulators may be<br>
useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.;<br>
Routledge, C; Upton, N. British Journal of Pharmaco/ogy 1999,127 Proc.<br>
Supplement 131P and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.;<br>
Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.;<br>
Brown, A. M. British Journal of Pharmacology 2000, 130(7), 1606-1612).<br>
Taken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are<br>
5-HT6 receptor ligands may be useful for therapeutic indications including: the<br>
treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition, and learning<br>
such as Alzheimer"s and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality<br>
disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g., anxiety,<br>
depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor<br>
disorders such as Parkinson"s disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases<br>
associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke and head trauma; or withdrawal<br>
from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol, and other substances of<br>
abuse.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide compounds which are<br>
useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system<br>
disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide therapeutic methods and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment of central nervous system<br>
disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
It is a feature of this invention that the compounds provided may also be used<br>
to further study and elucidate the 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
These and other objects and features of the invention will become more<br>
apparent by the detailed description set forth hereinbelow.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 (5-HT6) receptor is one of the most recent<br>
receptors to be identified by molecular cloning. Its ability to bind a wide range of<br>
therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in<br>
the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of<br>
interacting with or affecting said receptor. Significant efforts are being made to<br>
understand the possible role of the 5-HT6 receptor in psychiatry, cognitive<br>
dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. To that end,<br>
compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are earnestly<br>
sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT6 receptor and as potential therapeutic<br>
agents In the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see<br>

or<br>
f) converting a basic compound of formula I to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof or vice versa.<br>
The compounds of the invention are conveniently prepared by processes<br>
illustrated in the following flow diagrams wherein Hal represents Cl, Br or I.<br><br>
Bases suitable for use in the process of the invention include strong bases<br>
such as NaH, KOt-Bu, NaOH or any conventional base capable of removing a proton<br>
from a basic azaindole nitrogen atom.<br>
Solvents suitable for use in the process of the invention include polar solvents<br>
such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, or the<br>
like. If two immiscible solvents are used, a phase transfer catalyst may be present<br>
Preferably, for the preparation of those compounds of formula I wherein Rs and Re<br>
are H, the compound of formula II may be reacted with a base as described<br>
hereinabove in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, such as<br>
tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate, to give the desired compound of formula I<br>
wherein Rs and Re are H.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula I wherein R5and Ra are H (la) may be<br>
prepared by reacting the formula II compound with a di-haloalkyl compound of<br>
formula IV to give the 1-(haloalkyl)azaindole of formula V; reacting the formula V<br><br>
azaindole with potassium phthalimide to give the intermediate of formula VI and<br>
reacting said intermediate with hydrazine to give the desired formula la compound.<br>
The reaction sequence is shown in flow diagram II wherein Hal represents Cl, Br or I.<br><br>
Compounds of formula V may also be reacted directly with an amine,<br>
HNRsRe, to give compounds of formula I. Compounds of formula II may be prepared<br>
using conventional synthetic methods and, if required, standard separation and<br>
isolation techniques. For example, a nitropyridine compound of formula VII may be<br>
reacted with a chtorornethytsulfonyl compound of formula VIII in the presence of a<br>
strong base to give the intermediate of formula IX; said formula IX intermediate may<br>
then be treated with a reducing agent such as Fe, Zn or Sn in the presence of an<br>
acid to give the amine of formula X; said amine may then be acylated with the<br>
appropriate orthoester of formula XI to give the formula XII compound; and said<br>
compound may be cyclized in the presence of a base to give the desired formula II3-<br><br>
sulfonyl azaindole. The general synthetic method is described by W. Wojciechowski<br>
and M. Makosza, Synthesis 1986,651-653. The reaction sequence is shown in flow<br>
diagram III.<br><br>
Compounds of formula II may also be prepared directly from an azaindole<br>
compound, i.e. an azaindole of formula XIII may be reacted with iodine, optionally in<br>
the presence of Kl, to give the corresponding 3-iodoazaindole of formula XIV and<br>
said 3-iodoazaindole may be coupled with an appropriate thiol of formula XV to give<br>
the 3-thioazaindole of formula XVI. Said formula XVI compound may then be<br>
oxidized using conventional oxidizing reagents such as H2O2, m-chloroperbenzoic<br><br>
acid or the like to afford the formula II intermediate. The reaction is shown in flow<br>
diagram IV.<br><br>
Alternatively, the formula XVI 3-thioazaindole intermediate may be prepared<br>
in a single step from the azaindole of formula XIII by reacting said formula XIII<br>
compound with the formula XV thiol in the presence of iodine, preferably in a polar<br>
solvent such as aqueous alcohol. The thus-obtained formula II compounds may then<br>
be earned on to the desired compounds of formula I by allegation of the basic<br>
azaindole nitrogen as shown in flow diagrams I and II hereinabove.<br>
Compounds of formula XIII may also be converted to the desired compounds<br>
of formula I wherein Rs and Ffe are other than H (la) by reacting the formula XIII<br>
azaindole with an amine of formula Ilia wherein R5 and Re are other than H to give<br>
the N-alkylated compound of formula XVII; reacting the formula XVII compound with<br>
a sulfonyl chloride of formula XVIII, optionally in the presence of a reagent such as<br><br>
Ag(OSO2CF3) or Bi(OSO2CF3)3, to give the desired compound of formula la.<br>
Similarly, compounds of formula I wherein R5 and Re are H (Ib) may be prepared<br>
directly from the formula XIII intermediate by reacting said formula XIII intermediate<br>
with a nitrile of formula XIX to give the corresponding alkylated compound of formula<br>
XX; suffonylating said formula XX compound to give the compound of formula XXI;<br>
and reducing the formula XXI compound using conventional reducing reagents such<br>
as borane in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to give the desired compounds of formula Ib. The<br>
reactions are shown in flow diagram V wherein Hal represents Cl, Br or I.<br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 82<br>
Comparative Evaluation of 5-HT6 Binding Affinity of Test Compounds<br>
The affinity of test compounds for the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is evaluated<br>
in the following manner. Cultured Hela cells expressing human cloned 5-HT6<br>
receptors are harvested and centrifuged at tow speed (1,000 x g) for 10.0 min to<br>
remove the culture media. The harvested cells are suspended in half volume of fresh<br>
physiological phosphate buffered saline solution and recentrifuged at the same<br>
speed. This operation is repeated. The collected cells are then homogenized in ten<br>
volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCI (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EDTA. The homogenate is<br>
centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30.0 min and the precipitate is collected. The obtained<br>
pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris.HCI buffer and recentrifuged at the same<br>
speed. The final pellet is suspended in a small volume of Tris.HCI buffer and the<br>
tissue protein content is determined in aliquots of 10-25 /A volumes. Bovine Serum<br><br>
Albumin is used as the standard in the protein determination according to the method<br>
described in Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193:265 (1951). The volume of the<br>
suspended cell membranes is adjusted to give a tissue protein concentration of 1.0<br>
mg/ml of suspension. The prepared membrane suspension (10 times concentrated)<br>
is aliquoted in 1.0 ml volumes and stored at -70° C until used in subsequent binding<br>
experiments.<br>
Binding experiments are performed in a 96 well microtiter plate format, in a<br>
total volume of 200 µI. To each well is added the following mixture: 80.0 µI of<br>
incubation buffer made in 50 mM Tris.HCI buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10.0 mM MgCfe<br>
and 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 µA of [3H]-LSD (SA, 86.0 Ci/mmol, available from<br>
Amersham Life Science), 3.0 nM. The dissociation constant, Ko of the [3H]LSD at the<br>
human serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is 2.9 nM, as determined by saturation binding with<br>
increasing concentrations of [3H]LSD. The reaction is initiated by the final addition of<br>
100.0 µI of tissue suspension. Nonspecific binding is measured in the presence of<br>
10.0 µM methiothepin. The test compounds are added in 20.0 µI volume.<br>
The reaction is allowed to proceed in the dark for 120 min at room<br>
temperature, at which time, the bound ligand-receptor complex is filtered off on a 96<br>
well unifilter with a Packard Filtermate* 196 Harvester. The bound complex caught<br>
on the filter disk is allowed to air dry and the radioactivity is measured in a Packard<br>
TopCount* equipped with six photomultiplier detectors, after the addition of 40.0µl<br>
Microscint*-20 scintillant to each shallow well. The unifilter plate is heat-sealed and<br>
counted in a PackardTopCount* with a tritium efficiency of 31.0%.<br>
Specific binding to the 5-HT6 receptor is defined as the total radioactivity<br>
bound less the amount bound in the presence of 10.0µM unlabeled methiothepin.<br>
Binding in the presence of varying concentrations of test compound is expressed as<br>
a percentage of specific binding in the absence of test compound. The results are<br>
plotted as log % bound versus log concentration of test compound. Nonlinear<br>
regression analysis of data points with a computer assisted program Prism® yielded<br>
both the ICso and the Ki values of test compounds with 95% confidence limits. A<br>
linear regression line of data points is plotted, from which the IG50 value is<br>
determined and the Ki value is determined based upon the following equation:<br>
K1=IC50/(1+L/KD)<br><br>
where L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand used and KD is the dissociation<br>
constant of the ligand for the receptor, both expressed in nM.<br>
Using this assay, the following Ki values are determined and compared to<br>
those values obtained by representative compounds known to demonstrate binding<br>
to the 5-HT6 receptor. The data are shown in Table VI, below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As can be seen from the results set forth above, the compounds of the<br>
present invention demonstrate significant affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor.<br><br>
