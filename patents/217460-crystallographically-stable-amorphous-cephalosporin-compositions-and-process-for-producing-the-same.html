				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A composition comprising a crystallographically stable,<br>
amorphous cephalosporin and processes for the preparation<br>
thereof<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to an orally administrable and<br>
powdery composition consisting essentially of a number of<br>
particles each comprising a crystallographically stable and<br>
amorphous cephalosporin. More specifically, this invention<br>
relates to a novel, orally administrable and powdery<br>
composition consisting essentially of particles which each<br>
have a uniform internal texture within each particle and each<br>
are formed from a homogeneous mixture of an amorphous and<br>
water-soluble substance of 7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)<br>
-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)<br>
ethenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid pivaloyloxymethyl ester,<br>
that is, Cefditoren pivoxil (a generic name), with a water-<br>
soluble, high-molecular additive, for example, a water-<br>
solubilized derivative of cellulose.  This invention further<br>
relates to processes for the preparation of the novel, orally<br>
administrable and powdery composition as above-mentioned.<br>
Background Art:<br>
The cephem compound known under the generic name<br>
"cefditoren" is the compound which is represented by the<br>
following formula (A)<br>
and which compound was at first named as 7-[2-<br>
methoxyimino-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[2-(4-<br>
methylthiazol-5-yl)vinyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid<br>
(syn-isomer, cis-isomer) (refer to Japanese Patent<br>
Publication Hei 3-64503 specification, United States Patent<br>
No.4,839,350 and European Patent No.0175610 specification).<br>
Cefditoren pivaloyloxymethyl ester is a pharmacitical substance<br>
known under the generic name "Cefditoren pivoxil" and is the<br>
compound represented by the following formula (B)<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil is also known in the name of "(-)-(6R,7R)<br>
-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]<br>
-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-l-<br>
azabicyclo[4.2.0] oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid 2,2-<br>
dimethylpropionyloxymethyl ester" and is described on page<br>
317 of the literature "Merck Index", the 12th Edition to be<br>
a pale yellow-colored powdery substance melting at 127~129°C.<br>
Another chemical name of the compound "Cefditoren pivoxil"<br>
is 7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]<br>
-3-[(z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-3-cephem-4-<br>
carboxylic acid pivaloyloxymethyl ester.<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil, when orally administered, can be<br>
well absorbed by the digestive tracts, within which Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil is hydrolyzed into Cefditoren. It is known that<br>
Cefditoren is an antibiotic substance possessing an extremely<br>
broad antibacterial spectrum but a low toxicity and Cefditoren<br>
is very excellently useful for the therapeutic treatment and<br>
prevention of diseases which are caused by gram-positive and<br>
gram-negative bacteria. At present, Cefditoren pivoxil is<br><br>
widely utilized as an orally administrable pharmacitical substance for the<br>
therapy.<br>
We, the present inventors, had made investigations<br>
with the intention of obtaining a highly pure product of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil, and as a result, we already succeeded<br>
in obtaining Cefditoren pivoxil in the form of an<br>
orthorhombic crystalline substance (at a purity of: 97~<br>
98 %) of a melting point of 206 ~ 215.7 °C (with<br>
decomposition), by adopting a certain particular process<br>
(refer to International Open-Laying Publication No.<br>
W098/12200 of PCT application No. PCT/JP97/03340, issued on<br>
March 26, 1998).  This orthorhombic crystalline substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil shows such advantages that it has a<br>
high purity, a high thermal stability and a high storage-<br>
stability under high-humidity conditions , but still it shows<br>
such disadvantage that it itself is not so suitable for the<br>
purpose of oral administrations due to its poor solubility<br>
in water.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In general, for such medicinal compounds which are<br>
sparingly soluble in water, it is well known that the<br>
solubility or the dissolution speed of the sparingly<br>
water-soluble compounds in water can exert a great influence<br>
on the absorption in vivo of said compounds. Thus, many<br>
reports were presented on how to improve the water-solubility<br>
of such medicinal compounds which are sparingly soluble in<br>
water. One of the reported proposals is a method in which a<br>
medicinal compound sparingly soluble in water is converted<br>
into an amorphous substance, thus to improve the solubility<br>
of the compound in water. It is known that an amorphous<br>
substance generally has a higher solubility in water, as<br>
compared with that of the corresponding crystalline substance.<br>
It is therefore expectable that if the orthorhombic<br>
crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil sparingly soluble<br>
in water is converted into an amorphous substance which is<br>
of a higher solubility in water, there may be afforded such<br>
a water-soluble and highly pure product of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
which is capable of exhibiting its therapeutic efficacy to<br>
a full extent.<br>
We have therefore further prosecuted diligently our<br>
investigations in order to solve the problem of convertinq the<br>
crystalline Cefditoren pivoxil into an amorphous substance<br>
having a higher water-solubility. As a result, we have now<br>
found that there can successfully be prepared an orally<br>
administrable, yellow-colored powdery composition consisting<br>
essentially of such particles which each have a uniform<br>
internal texture or tissue within each particle and which each<br>
are formed from a homogeneous mixture of the amorphous<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil substance having a high water-solubility<br>
and a high thermal stability, with a water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive, when use is made of such a process which<br>
comprises dissolving a crystalline Cefditoren pivoxil in an<br>
acidic aqueous solution containing a water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive, for example, a water-solubilized<br>
derivative of cellulose and an acid dissolved therein, thereby<br>
to form an acidic aqueous solution containing Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil, the water-soluble high-molecular additive and the<br>
acid dissolved therein, then slowly adding to the resultant<br>
acidic aqueous solution an aqueous solution of an inorganic<br>
base to neutralize said acidic aqueous solution to a neutral<br>
or a substantially neutral pH value, with co-precipitating<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil and said water-soluble high-molecular<br>
additive simultaneously from said aqueous solution during the<br>
neutralization operation, then washing the deposited<br>
precipitate with an aqueous solution of the water-soluble<br>
high-molecular additive, drying the washed precipitate, and<br>
recovering the resulting particulate product so dried. This<br>
invention has been established on the basis of these findings<br>
mentioned above.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of this invention,<br>
there is provided an orally administrable, yellow-colored<br>
powdery composition consisting essentially of solid particles<br>
which each are formed of a homogeneous mixture of a crystallo-<br>
graphically stable, amorphous and water-soluble substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil with a water-soluble high-molecular<br>
additive, and which particles have a uniform, internal texture<br>
within each particle, characterized in that said yellow-<br>
colored powdery composition consists essentially of the solid<br>
particles each formed of the homogeneous mixture of (i) the<br>
crystallographically stable, amorphous and water-soluble<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, namely 7-[(Z)-2-(2-<br>
aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-<br>
methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl ester, with (ii) the water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive which is either such a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, water-solubilized derivative of cellulose as<br>
chosen from hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-<br>
methyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl<br>
cellulose and a pharmaceutically acceptable alkali metal salt<br>
or alkaline earth metal salt of carboxymethyl cellulose, or<br>
pluran, carrageenan, polyvinylpyrrolidone or an alginic acid<br>
ester of polypropylene glycol, that the water-soluble<br>
high-molecular additive (ii) contained in the above-mentioned<br>
solid particles is present in said particles in a proportion<br>
of 0.5 % ~ 5 % based on the weight of the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
substance, that said particles fuse at a temperature of 120 °C<br>
or higher, but do not show any definite melting point, that<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (i) contained<br>
in said particles does not show any peak of the angle of<br>
diffraction in a X-ray powder diffractometry chart of said<br>
particles but exhibits in its infrared absorption spectrum<br>
(as measured by pelleted potassium bromide method) a<br>
substantially broader peak of absorption at a wave number of<br>
1750 cm-1, as compared with the sharp peak of absorption<br>
exhibited by the orthorhombic crystalline substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil at a wave number of 1750 cm-1 in the infra-<br>
red absorption spectrum, and that the amorphous substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil (i) contained in said particles can be<br>
dissolved in an acidified water containing hydrochloric acid<br>
(pH 1.2) at a solubility of at least 4 mg/ml of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil at 37 °C and has a crystallographical stability such<br>
that said amorphous Cefditoren pivoxil substance does not<br>
involve crystallization when stored at 40 °C for 4 months in<br>
a sealed container under dry conditions.<br>
One preferred example of the powdery composition<br>
according to the first aspect of this invention is such a<br>
composition consisting essentially of particles each formed<br>
of a homogeneous mixture of a crystallographically stable,<br>
amorphous and water-soluble substance of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
with the water-soluble high-molecular additive which is<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
methyl cellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and which additive<br>
as blended is present in a proportion of 1 % ~ 3 % based on<br>
the weight of the Cefditoren pivoxil.<br>
Further, in respect of the respective solid particles<br>
which each are formed of the homogeneous mixture of the<br>
amorphous Cefditoren pivoxil with the water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive and which are present in the powdery<br>
composition according to the first aspect of this invention,<br>
we have now observed, under a polarizing microscope of 400<br>
magnifications or under an electron microscope, the surface<br>
texture or tissue of said solid particles, and we have found<br>
that the surface of each particle has a simple and uniform<br>
texture or tissue. We cannot find any presence of independent<br>
and separate grains of either Cefditoren pivoxil or the<br>
high-molecular additive in the surface of each particle.<br>
In the powdery composition according to the first<br>
aspect of this invention, the water-soluble high-molecular<br>
additive which is to be mixed with the amorphous Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil, and which is the water-solubilized cellulose<br>
derivatives, or pluran, carrageenan, polyvinylpyrrolidone or<br>
an arginic acid ester of polypropylene glycol, may be of a<br>
grade thereof which usually is used and incorporated in the<br>
formulations of medicines as a binder or a suspending agent.<br>
Among the water-soluble high-molecular additives to be usable<br>
in the composition of the first aspect of this invention, the<br>
water-solubilized derivatives of cellulose are particularly<br>
preferred. As the water-solubilized derivatives of cellulose,<br>
there may be used hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (abbreviated<br>
as HPMC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate (abbreviated<br>
as HPMCP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (abbreviated as HPC), methyl<br>
cellulose (abbreviated as MC), carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
calcium salt or carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt. The use<br>
of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose (HPC) or methyl cellulose (MC) is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
In the homogeneous mixture which constitutes the<br>
solid particles present in the powdery composition of the first<br>
aspect of this invention, and which is composed of the<br>
amorphous Cefditoren pivoxil and the water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive, the proportion of the water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive to be incorporated therein may be in a range<br>
of 0.5 % ~ 5 %, preferably in a range of 1 % ~ 3 % based on<br>
the weight of Cefditoren pivoxil.<br>
Further, we have tried to measure the melting point<br>
of the solid particles present in the composition of the first<br>
aspect of this invention, by placing the particles in a melting<br>
point-measuring apparatus. As a result, we have found that<br>
these solid particles fuse at 120 ~ 150 °C with decomposition,<br>
but do not show any one definite melting point.<br>
We have further carried out the measurement of powder<br>
X-ray diffraction of the solid particles present in the<br>
composition of the first aspect of this invention, by placing<br>
the particles in a X-ray powder diffraction apparatus (Rigaku<br>
Denki K. K. : Geigerflex 2027) . Upon analysis of the pattern<br>
of the resulting X-ray diffraction chart of said X-ray powder<br>
diffraction, it is shown that no peak is appearing in the angle<br>
of diffraction, indicating that the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
substance existing in said solid particles is amorphous in<br>
nature.<br>
We have further carried out a measurement of infrared<br>
absorption spectrum of the solid particles present in the<br>
composition of the first aspect of this invention, by mixing<br>
the solid particles with an amount of potassium bromide,<br>
compressing the resultant mixture to pelletize the same, and<br>
then placing the resulting pellet into an infrared absorption<br>
spectrometer.  In the spectrum chart thus obtained, the<br>
infrared absorption spectrum of the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
substance present in said powder exhibits at a wave number<br>
of 1750 cm"1 an absorption peak which is substantially broader<br>
than such a sharp absorption peak that the orthorhombic<br>
crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil exhibits at a wave<br>
number of 1750 cm"1 in its infrared absorption spectrum.<br>
We have also made a measurement of powder X-ray<br>
diffraction of the previously stored solid particles present<br>
in the composition of the first aspect of this invention, by<br>
placing and storing said solid particles in a sealed container<br>
under a dry air atmosphere at 40 °C for 4 months, followed by<br>
measuring the powder X-ray diffraction of the stored particles<br>
in the powder X-ray diffraction apparatus used as above.<br>
Analysis of the pattern of the resulting powder X-ray<br>
diffraction chart did not indicate any peak in the angle of<br>
diffraction in the chart. Thus, it is demonstrated that the<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil present in the particles stored as above<br>
has remained in the amorphous state and that it is<br>
crystallographically stable and can maintain the amorphous<br>
state even after the storage thereof for a long period of time.<br>
We presume that in the composition of this invention,<br>
the water-soluble high-molecular additive co-existent in<br>
admixture with the Cefditoren pivoxil in the solid particles<br>
can possess a function capable of inhibiting the molecules<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil from undergoing their crystalli-<br>
zation.<br>
The solid particles present in the composition of this<br>
invention have an average particle diameter within the range<br>
of 0.5 µ ~ 100 µ.<br>
The solid particles present in the composition of this<br>
invention were tested for the measurement of their water-<br>
solubility as shown in Test Example given hereinafter. It was<br>
thus found that the amorphous Cefditoren pivoxil contained<br>
in said particles was soluble in an acidified water of pH 1.2<br>
containing about 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (corresponding to the<br>
artificial gastric juice specified in Japanese Pharmacopedia)<br>
and had a solubility of at least 4 mg/ml in the acidified water<br>
at 37 °C.<br>
Furthermore, we have proceeded our further<br>
investigation. Thus, when we carry out, for the purpose of<br>
producing the particles of the powdery composition of the first<br>
aspect invention, the process which comprises the steps of<br>
completely dissolving a crystalline Cefditoren pivoxil in an<br>
acidic aqueous solution containing and having dissolved<br>
therein a water-soluble high- molecular additive and an acid,<br>
thereby to prepare an acidic aqueous solution containing<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil, the water- soluble high-molecular<br>
additive and the acid all dissolved therein, then slowly adding<br>
to the resulting acidic aqueous solution so prepared an aqueous<br>
solution of an inorganic base, thereby to neutralize the acidic<br>
aqueous solution to a neutral pH value or a substantially<br>
neutral pH value, allowing, during the neutralization<br>
operation, Cefditoren pivoxil and the first-mentioned<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive to co-precipitate<br>
simultaneously from said aqueous acidic solution, separating<br>
and then washing the deposited precipitate with an aqueous<br>
solution of the first-mentioned a water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive and subsequently drying the washed<br>
precipitate, we have now found that the aforesaid process can<br>
be carried out in such one modified manner that the first<br>
mentioned water-soluble high-molecular additive, which was<br>
contained in said acidic aqueous solution of the water-soluble<br>
high-molecular additive and the acid to be employed for the<br>
dissolution of Cefditoren pivoxil, and which is to be contained<br>
in the washing aqueous solution of the high-molecular additive<br>
for washing the deposited precipitate, is replaced by such<br>
a second, water-soluble high-molecular additive which is made<br>
of a compound different from said first-mentioned high-<br>
molecular additive, when it is intended to prepare a washing<br>
aqueous solution of the water-soluble high-molecular additive<br>
which is to be employed in the step of washing said deposited<br>
precipitate therewith, and thereby at least a portion of the<br>
second, water-soluble high-molecular additive present in so<br>
prepared the washing aqueous solution of the second additive<br>
as employed for the aforesaid washing step is allowed to<br>
transfer into the surface of the precipitate particles during<br>
said washing step.  It has further been found that, when said<br>
washing step is conducted with said aqueous solution of the<br>
second-mentioned additive, followed by conducting the steps<br>
of recovering and drying the precipitate particles of which<br>
the surface have contained therein the second, water-soluble<br>
high-molecular additive as transferred from the washing<br>
aqueous solution employed in said washing step, there can be<br>
afforded such dried precipitate particles wherein the surface<br>
layer of each of said solid particles as collected is formed<br>
from a homogeneous mixture of the amorphous Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
with the first, water-soluble high-molecular additive and the<br>
second, water-soluble high-molecular additive, but wherein<br>
the central portion or core portion of each of the solid<br>
particles lying under the surface layer of the solid particles<br>
is formed from a homogeneous mixture of the amorphous<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil with the first, water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive.<br>
According to a second aspect of this invention,<br>
therefore, there is provided an orally administrable, yellow-<br>
colored powdery composition consisting essentially of<br>
particles which each substantially comprise mixtures of a<br>
crystallographically stable, amorphous and water-soluble<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive or additives, and which particles have a<br>
uniform, internal texture within each particle, characterized<br>
in that the yellow-colored powdery composition consists<br>
essentially of the particles each substantially comprising<br>
a mixture of (i) the crystallographically stable, amorphous<br>
and water-soluble substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, namely<br>
7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-<br>
3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-3-cephem-4-<br>
carboxylic acid pivaloyloxymethyl ester, with (ii) a first,<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive which is either such<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable, water-solubilized derivative<br>
of cellulose as chosen from hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose, methyl cellulose and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
alkali metal salt or alkaline earth metal salt of carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, or pluran, carrageenan, polyvinylpyrrolidone or<br>
an alginic acid ester of polypropylene glycol, that the central<br>
portion or core portion of the respective particles which is<br>
lying under the surface layer of said respective particles<br>
is formed only from a homogeneous mixture of (i) the amorphous<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with (ii) the above-mentioned<br>
first, water-soluble high-molecular additive, but the surface<br>
layer of said particles is formed from a homogeneous mixture<br>
of (i) the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with (ii)<br>
the first, water-soluble high-molecular additive and also with<br>
(iii) such a second, water-soluble high-molecular additive<br>
which is additionally incorporated and which second additive<br>
is made of a substance different from the above-mentioned first,<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive present just in the<br>
central portion or core portion of said particles lying under<br>
said surface layer of the particle, and which second,<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive is selected from<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
methyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone, that both the first,<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive (ii) and the second,<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive (iii) are present in<br>
a total proportion of them of 0.5 % ~ 5 % based on the weight<br>
of the Cefditoren pivoxil substance contained in said<br>
particles, that said particles fuse at a temperature of 120 °C<br>
or higher, but do not show any definite melting point, that<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (i) contained<br>
in said particles does not show any peak of the angle of<br>
diffraction in a powder X-ray diffractometry chart of said<br>
particles but exhibits in its infrared absorption spectrum<br>
(as measured by pelleted potassium bromide method) a<br>
substantially broader peak of absorption at a wave number of<br>
1750 cm"1, as compared with the sharp peak of absorption<br>
exhibited by the ortho-rhombic crystalline substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil at a wave number of 1750 cm-1 in the infrared<br>
absorption spectrum, and that the amorphous substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil (i) contained in said particles can be<br>
dissolved in an acidified water containing hydrochloric acid<br>
(pH 1.2) at a solubility of at least 4 mg/ml of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil at 37 °C and has a crystallographical stability such<br>
that said amorphous Cefditoren pivoxil substance does not<br>
the particles constituting the composition, which is lying<br>
under the surface layer of the particles, is formed from a<br>
homogeneous mixture of the amorphous substance of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil with methyl cellulose, but the surface layer of said<br>
particles is formed from a homogeneous mixture of the amorphous<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with methyl cellulose and also<br>
with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose or hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose.<br>
A fourth preferred example of the powdery composition<br>
according to the second aspect of this invention is such a<br>
composition, wherein the central portion or core portion of<br>
the particles constituting the composition, which is lying<br>
under the surface layer of the particles, is formed from a<br>
homogeneous mixture of the amorphous substance of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil with polyvinylpyrrolidone, but the surface layer of<br>
said particles is formed from a homogeneous mixture of the<br>
amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone and also with hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose or hydroxypropyl cellulose or methyl cellulose.<br>
The solid particles present in the composition of the<br>
second aspect of this invention have physical and<br>
physicochemical properties substantially the same as those<br>
of the solid particles present in the composition according<br>
to the first aspect of this invention.<br>
Besides, the solid particles present in the<br>
composition according to the second aspect of this invention<br>
have been found to be such those that, when the surface of<br>
the particles are observed under a polarizing microscope or<br>
under an electron microscope, said surface has a simple and<br>
uniform, internal texture in each particle and does not<br>
substantially contain any independently separate grains of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil, nor any independently separate grains of<br>
the water- soluble high-molecular additives in the surface<br>
texture or tissue of said particles.<br>
Both of the powdery composition according to the first<br>
aspect of this invention and the powdery composition according<br>
to the second aspect of this invention are orally administrable,<br>
and they may be formulated in the form of tablets by blending<br>
said composition with excipient(s), for example, starch or<br>
talc, and/or binder (s), for example, gelatine or hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose, and a suitable additive agent, and then compressing<br>
the resulting blend into tablets. Both of the powdery<br>
compositions according to the first and second aspects of this<br>
invention may also be formulated in the form of powdery<br>
preparations by blending such composition with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable powdery carrier, for example,<br>
starch or cellulose powder.<br>
For a process for the preparation of the powdery<br>
composition according to the first aspect of this invention,<br>
there is provided, according to a third aspect of this<br>
invention, a process for the preparation of a yellow-colored<br>
powdery composition consisting essentially of particles which<br>
each are formed of a homogeneous mixture of a<br>
crystallographically stable, amorphous and water-soluble<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with a water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive, and which particles have a uniform,<br>
internal texture within each particle, characterized in that<br>
the process comprises a step of dissolving an orthorhombic<br>
crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, namely 7-[ (Z )-2-<br>
(2-aminothiazol-4-yl) -2-inethoxyiminoacetamido] -3- [ (Z }-2-<br>
(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl ester, in an acidic aqueous solution which<br>
is containing a water-soluble high-molecular additive made<br>
of either such a water-solubilized derivative of cellulose<br>
as chosen from hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose, methyl cellulose and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
alkali metal salt or alkaline earth metal salt of carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, or pluran, carrageenan, polyvinylpyrrolidone or<br>
an alginic acid ester of polypropylene glycol as dissolved<br>
at a concentration of 0.05 % to 1 % (weight/weight basis),<br>
and which acidic aqueous solution is containing also<br>
hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid,<br>
propionic acid or butyric acid at a concentration of 0.1N ~<br>
12N of the acid, so that the amount of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
dissolved in said acidic aqueous solution is in the range of<br>
10 times to 130 times based on the whole weight of said<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive contained in said<br>
acidic aqueous solution, and so that there is prepared an<br>
acidic aqueous solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil, the<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive and the acid dissolved<br>
therein; a step of subsequently neutralizing the acidic<br>
aqueous solution so prepared by adding slowly thereto an<br>
aqueous solution or solutions of sodium or potassium hydroxide,<br>
sodium or potassium hydrogen carbonate, or sodium or potassium<br>
carbonate, singly or in combination, or an aqueous solution<br>
of ammonium hydroxide, with maintaining said acidic aqueous<br>
solution at a temperature of 10 °C or below under stirring,<br>
and with the amount of the basic sodium or potassium compound<br>
or ammonium hydroxide to be added to said acidic aqueous<br>
solution being so adjusted that the resulting reaction<br>
solution after the neutralization shows a pH value of 6.5 ~<br>
7.1; and a step of continuing during the neutralization<br>
reaction the stirring of the aqueous solution containing<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil at a temperature of 10 °C or below, to bring<br>
about co-precipitation of Cefditoren pivoxil and the<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive simultaneously from<br>
the aqueous solution; a step of collecting by filtration or<br>
centrifugation, the so deposited precipitate from the<br>
resulting neutralization reaction mixture; a step of washing<br>
the collected precipitate with an aqueous solution of a<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive made of the same<br>
substance as that of the first-mentioned water-soluble<br>
high-molecular additive and containing said additive<br>
dissolved in said solution at a concentration of 0.5 % ~ 10 %<br>
(weight/ weight basis), while at least a portion of said<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive used here in the washing<br>
aqueous solution is allowed during the washing operation to<br>
transfer from the washing aqueous solution of the water-<br>
soluble high-molecular additive into the surfaces of the<br>
particles of said precipitate; and a step of then drying the<br>
washed precipitate, to afford the yellow-colored powdery<br>
composition consisting essentially of the particles each<br>
formed of the homogeneous mixture of the crystallographically<br>
stable, amorphous and water-soluble substance of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil with the above-mentioned water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive present in a proportion of 0.5 % ~ 5 % based<br>
on the weight of the Cefditoren pivoxil substance.<br>
In practicing the process of the third aspect of this<br>
invention, the acid present in the aqueous solution of the<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive and the acid to be used<br>
for the dissolution of the crystalline Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
substance may preferably be hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
acetic acid or sulfuric acid. Particularly, hydrochloric<br>
acid is preferred. The concentration of the acid in said<br>
aqueous solution may be within a range of 0.1N ~ 12N, with<br>
a range of 0.5N ~ 2.0N being particularly preferred.<br>
The step of dissolving the crystalline Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil substance in the acidic aqueous solution containing<br>
said water-soluble high-molecular additive and acid may<br>
preferably be carried out at a temperature of 10 °C or lower.<br>
The dissolution of the crystalline Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
substance may preferably be effected with taking a period of<br>
time of 10 ~ 60 minutes therefor. By adopting these operation<br>
conditions, it is necessary to make the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
substance dissolved completely in the aqueous solution of the<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive and the acid.<br>
Next, there is effected the step of neutralizing the<br>
resulting aqueous solution of the Cefditoren pivoxil, water-<br>
soluble high-molecular additive and acid, with an inorganic<br>
base. The aqueous solution of an inorganic base used for this<br>
neutralization step may preferably be an aqueous ammonium<br>
hydroxide solution, namely aqueous ammonia, or aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solution, aqueous potassium hydroxide solution,<br>
aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution or aqueous<br>
potassium hydrogen carbonate solution. Aqueous ammonia is<br>
particularly preferred. The concentration of the inorganic<br>
base in the aqueous solution of the inorganic base may be in<br>
a range of 0.1N ~ 14N, but the base concentration in a range<br>
of 0.5N~ 2 .0N is particularly preferred. An aqueous solution<br>
of one inorganic base may be used in combination with an aqueous<br>
solution of another inorganic base. The addition of the<br>
aqueous solution of the inorganic base is preferably carried<br>
out slowly, while maintaining the neutralization reaction<br>
mixture at a temperature of 0 °C ~ 10 °C. The addition may<br>
preferably be effected dropwise. The time to be taken for the<br>
neutralization reaction may be 5 minutes ~ 24 hours and<br>
preferably 5 minutes ~ 10 hours. During the neutralization<br>
reaction, it is preferred that the amount of the inorganic<br>
base added is so controlled that the resulting reaction mixture<br>
shows a pH value of 6.5 ~ 7.0 at the completion of the<br>
neutralization. With the progress of the neutralization<br>
reaction, Cefditoren pivoxil and the water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive are allowed to be co-precipitated<br>
simultaneously from the aqueous solution, resulting in the<br>
deposition of solid precipitate. This precipitate is<br>
composed of a mixture of Cefditoren pivoxil with the<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive.<br>
After the completion of the neutralization reaction,<br>
the precipitate is then collected from the resulting<br>
neutralization reaction mixture. The collection of the<br>
precipitate may be effected by filtration, for example,<br>
filtration under a reduced pressure, or by centrifugation,<br>
in a conventional manner.<br>
Next, the precipitate so collected is subjected to the<br>
step of washing it at a temperature of 10 °C or below with an<br>
aqueous solution containing such a water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive which is of the same compound as the high-<br>
molecular additive just co-precipitated and thus included in<br>
said precipitate and which high-molecular additive is present<br>
at a concentration of 0.5 % ~ 10 % (weight %) in said aqueous<br>
solution. By this washing operation, the salts having<br>
attached to the precipitate can be removed, and at least a<br>
portion of the water-soluble high-molecular additive present<br>
in the washing aqueous solution is allowed to transfer into<br>
the surface of the precipitate particles from the washing<br>
aqueous solution of the water-soluble high-molecular additive<br>
during the washing operation.  If a plain water were used for<br>
the step of washing the precipitate, a portion of the<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive which has been included<br>
and contained in the precipitate could be washed away therefrom.<br>
In such a possible case, the particles of the powder which<br>
could be obtained after a drying of the precipitate so washed<br>
with the plain water would be undesirable as the target product<br>
wanted, because the content of the water-soluble high-<br>
molecular additive in the particles should be unsuitably lower<br>
than the desirable one. Such undesirable product is<br>
inappropriate in that the Cefditoren pivoxil component<br>
contained therein can show some tendency to crystallize out.<br>
The precipitate which has received the washing step<br>
as above is then dried in a conventional way. The drying step<br>
is preferably carried out at a temperature of 30 °C or lower<br>
under a reduced pressure. Thus, as the dried final product,<br>
there can be afforded a powdery composition consisting<br>
essentially of solid particles which each are formed of a<br>
homogeneous mixture of a crystallographically stable,<br>
amorphous and water-soluble substance of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
and the water-soluble high-molecular additive as mixed in a<br>
proportion of 0.5 % ~ 5 % (weight %) of said additive, based<br>
on the weight of the Cefditoren pivoxil substance.<br>
Preferably, the process of the third aspect of this<br>
invention may be effected by such a process comprising a step<br>
of dissolving the orthorhombic crystalline substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil in an acidic agueous solution which is<br>
containing such a water-soluble high-molecular additive as<br>
chosen from hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose, methyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone as<br>
dissolved at a concentration of 0.05 % to 1 % (weight/weight<br>
basis) and which acidic aqueous solution is containing also<br>
hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid at a concentration of<br>
0.5N ~ 2.0N of the acid, so that the amount of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil dissolved in said acidic aqueous solution is in a range<br>
of 10 times to 100 times based on the whole weight of said<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive contained in said<br>
acidic aqueous solution, and so that there is prepared an<br>
acidic aqueous solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil, the<br>
water soluble high-molecular additive and the acid dissolved<br>
therein; a step of subsequently neutralizing the so prepared<br>
acidic aqueous solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil, by<br>
adding slowly thereto a 1N ~ 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solution or/and a 1N ~ 2N aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate<br>
solution, or by adding slowly thereto a 1N ~ 2N aqueous<br>
ammonium hydroxide solution, with maintaining said acidic<br>
aqueous solution at a temperature of 5 °C or below under<br>
stirring, until said acidic aqueous solution is neutralized<br>
to a pH value of 6.5 ~ 7.0; a step of continuing during the<br>
neutralization reaction the stirring of the resulting<br>
neutralization reaction mixture at a temperature of 5 °C or<br>
below, to bring about co-precipitation of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
and the water-soluble high-molecular additive simultaneously<br>
from said aqueous solution; a step of collecting the so<br>
deposited precipitate from the resulting neutralization<br>
reaction mixture; a step of washing the collected precipitate<br>
with an aqueous solution of a water-soluble high-molecular<br>
additive made of the substance same as that of the first-<br>
mentioned water-soluble high-molecular additive and<br>
containing said additive dissolved in said solution at a<br>
concentration of 0.5 % ~ 10 % (weight/weight basis); and a<br>
step of then drying the washed precipitate, to afford the<br>
yellow-colored powdery composition consisting essentially of<br>
the particles each formed of a homogeneous mixture of the<br>
amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with the above-<br>
mentioned water-soluble high-molecular additive present in<br>
a proportion of 1 % ~ 3 % based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil substance.<br>
For a process for the preparation of the powdery<br>
composition of the second aspect of this invention, there is<br>
provided, according to a fourth aspect of this invention, a<br>
process for the preparation of a yellow-colored powdery<br>
composition consisting essentially of particles which each<br>
comprise mixtures of a crystallographically stable, amorphous<br>
and water-soluble substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive or additives, and which<br>
particles have a uniform, internal texture within each<br>
particle, characterized in that the process comprises a step<br>
of dissolving an orthorhombic substance of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
in an acidic aqueous solution which is containing a first<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive made of either such a<br>
water-solubilized derivative of cellulose as chosen from<br>
hydroxy-propylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl<br>
cellulose and a pharmaceutically acceptable alkali metal salt<br>
or alkaline earth metal salt of carboxymethyl cellulose, or<br>
pluran, carrageenan, polyvinylpyrrolidone or an alginic acid<br>
ester of polypropylene glycol as dissolved at a concentration<br>
of 0.05 % ~ 1 % (weight/weight basis) and which acidic aqueous<br>
solution is containing also hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
sulfuric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid or butyric acid<br>
at a concentration of 0.1N ~ 12N of the acid, so that the amount<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil dissolved in said acidic aqueous<br>
solution is in a range of 10 times to 130 times based on the<br>
whole weight of said first water-soluble high-molecular<br>
additive contained in said acidic aqueous solution, and so<br>
that there is prepared an acidic aqueous solution containing<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil, the first, water-soluble high-molecular<br>
additive and the acid dissolved therein; a step of subsequently<br>
neutralizing the so prepared acidic aqueous solution, by<br>
adding slowly thereto an aqueous solution or solutions of<br>
sodium or potassium hydroxide, sodium or potassium hydrogen<br>
carbonate, or sodium or potassium carbonate, singly or in<br>
combination, or by adding slowly thereto an aqueous solution<br>
of ammonium hydroxide, with maintaining said acidic aqueous<br>

temperature of 10 °C or below, to bring about co-precipitation<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil and the first, water-soluble high-<br>

a step of collecting by filtration or centrifugation the so<br>
deposited precipitate from the resulting neutralization<br>
reaction mixture; a step of washing the collected precipitate<br>
with such an aqueous solution which is containing a second,<br>
water-soluble high-molecular additive made of a substance<br>
different from the above-mentioned first, water-soluble<br>
high-molecular additive contained in said acidic aqueous<br>
solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil, and which aqueous<br>
solution is containing said second high molecular additive<br>
dissolved therein at a concentration of 0.5 % ~ 10% (weight/<br>

aqueous solution is allowed during the washing operation to<br>
transfer from the washing aqueous solution of the second water-<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Now, this invention is concretely illustrated with<br>
reference to typical Examples thereof, but is not limited to<br>
these Examples. The crystalline substance of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil used in Example 1 ~ 14 given hereinafter is the<br>
orthorhombic crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (mp.<br>
215 °C, a purity of about 97 %) obtained in Example 1 of the<br>
PCT International Open Laying Publication No. W098/ 12200.<br>
The following Examples 1 ~ 3 illustrate the<br>
preparation of the yellow-colored powdery composition<br>
according to the first aspect of this invention, and Examples<br>
4 ~ 14 illustrate the preparation of the yellow-colored<br>
powdery composition according to the second aspect of this<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The crystalline substance (20 g) of 7-[(Z)-2-(2-<br>
aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3- [ ( Z ) -2- ( 4-<br>
methylthiazol-5-yl)ethenyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl ester, namely Cefditoren pivoxil, was<br>
dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution (140 ml) containing<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose (200 mg) as dissolved therein and<br>
hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 1N of HC1, with taking<br>
a time of 11 minutes for the dissolution of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
therein. During this dissolution operation, the aqueous<br>
solution was maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower. Thus,<br>
there was prepared an acidic aqueous solution (pH 0.6 ) in which<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil had been completely dissolved. This<br>
acidic aqueous solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil was then<br>
neutralized (to a pH of 7.0) by a dropwise slow addition of<br>
a 1N aqueous ammonia (about 138 ml) thereto over a time period<br>
of 60 minutes at a temperature of 5 °C or lower. There occurred<br>
the deposition of precipitate. The resulting neutralization<br>
reaction mixture containing the precipitate as deposited was<br>
then stirred overnight at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The deposited precipitate was collected by filtration<br>
of said reaction mixture, and was then washed well with an<br>
aqueous solution of 0.5 % (by weight) of hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose (60 ml) . The precipitate so washed was dried under<br>
a reduced pressure.  Thus, there was afforded 19.6 g of a<br>
yellow-colored powder (the composition of this invention)<br>
consisting essentially of numerous fine particles which each<br>
were formed of a homogeneous mixture of the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil with hydroxypropyl cellulose. When<br>
observation was made, under an electron microscope<br>
(magnification: x 10000), of the surface of the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder, it was shown<br>
that the surface of these fine particles had a simple and<br>
uniform phase or texture.<br>
The content of hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in<br>
the fine particles present in said resulting yellow-colored<br>
powder was calculated, from an analysis by means of a gas<br>
chromatography, to be 1 % (by weight) on the basis of the<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil component. Further, by analyzing said<br>
fine particles in the above-mentioned powder X-ray diffraction<br>
apparatus, it was found that no peak was appearing in the angle<br>
of diffraction in the pattern of the resulting X-ray<br>
diffraction chart, and therefore that the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component present in these fine particles was in the form of<br>
the amorphous substance.<br>
Example 2<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution (35 ml) containing<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (50 mg) as dissolved therein<br>
and 1N HC1, at a temperature of 5 °C or lower and with taking<br>
a time of 10 minutes for the dissolution of Cefditoren pivoxil.<br>
Thus, there was prepared an acidic aqueous solution (pH 1.32)<br>
in which Cefditoren pivoxil had been completely dissolved.<br>
The resulting aqueous solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
was then neutralized (up to a pH of 6.9) by a dropwise slow<br>
addition of a 1N aqueous ammonia (about 33 ml) thereto over<br>
the time period of 30 minutes at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
There occurred the deposition of precipitate. The resulting<br>
neutralization reaction mixture was then stirred overnight<br>
at a temperature of 5 °C or lower. The deposited precipitate<br>
was collected by filtration, and was then washed well with<br>
an aqueous solution (15 ml) of 0.5 % (by weight) of hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose. The precipitate so washed was dried<br>
under a reduced pressure. Thus, there was afforded 4.9 g of<br>
a yellow-colored powder (the composition of this invention)<br>
consisting essentially of numerous fine particles which each<br>
were formed of a homogeneous mixture of the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil with hydroxy-propylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose contained<br>
in the fine particles present in the resulting yellow-colored<br>
powder was calculated to be 1 % (by weight) on the basis of<br>
the Cefditoren pivoxil component. Further, by analyzing said<br>
fine particles in the above-mentioned powder X-ray diffraction<br>
apparatus, it was found that the Cefditoren pivoxil component<br>
present in these fine particles was in the form of the amorphous<br>
substance.<br>
Example 3<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution (35 ml) containing<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (50 mg) as dissolved therein and HC1 at<br>
a concentration of 1N, at a temperature of 5 °C or lower and<br>
with taking a time of 10 minutes for the dissolution of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil. Thus, there was prepared an acidic<br>
aqueous solution (pH 0.4) in which Cefditoren pivoxil was<br>
completely dissolved. This aqueous solution was then<br>
neutralized by a dropwise slow addition of a 1N aqueous ammonia<br>
(about 34 ml) thereto over 30 minutes at a temperature of 5 °C<br>
or lower. During the neutralization reaction, precipitate<br>
deposited. The resulting neutralization reaction mixture<br>
(pH: 6.8) containing the precipitate as formed was stirred<br>
at a temperature of 5 °C or lower overnight. The deposited<br>
precipitate was collected by filtration, and was then washed<br>
well with an aqueous solution (15 ml) of 0.5 % (by weight)<br>
of polyvinylpyrrolidone. The precipitate so washed was dried<br>
under a reduced pressure. Thus, there was obtained 4.9 g of<br>
a yellow-colored powder consisting essentially of numerous<br>
fine particles which each were formed of a homogeneous mixture<br>
of the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil with<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
The content of polyvinylpyrrolidone contained in the<br>
fine particles present in the resulting yellow-colored powder<br>
was calculated to be 1 % (by weight) on the basis of the<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil component. By analyzing the said fine<br>
particles in the above-mentioned powder X-ray diffraction<br>
analyzer, it was found that the Cefditoren pivoxil component<br>
existing in these fine particles was in the form of the<br>
amorphous substance.<br>
Example 4<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (10<br>
g) was dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution (100 ml)<br>
containing about 1 g of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose as<br>
dissolved therein (at a concentration of 1 %) and HC1 at a<br>
concentration of 1N, at a temperature of 10 °C or lower. Thus,<br>
there was prepared an acidic aqueous solution in which<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil was completely dissolved. This acidic<br>
aqueous solution obtained was then neutralized by a dropwise<br>
slow addition of a 1N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (100<br>
ml) thereto, while the temperature was maintained at 5 °C or<br>
lower. During the neutralization reaction, precipitate<br>
slowly deposited from the aqueous solution. The resulting<br>
neutralization reaction mixture containing the precipitate<br>
was stirred overnight at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
Then, the neutralization reaction mixture was<br>
filtered, and the precipitate thus collected was placed in<br>
a filtration apparatus which was operated under a reduced<br>
pressure. To the filtration apparatus, an aqueous solution<br>
of 1 % of hydroxypropyl cellulose was added, followed by<br>
washing further the precipitate under pushing pressure. The<br>
precipitate so washed was dried under a reduced pressure, and<br>
there was thus obtained 9.6 g of a yellow-colored powder<br>
consisting essentially of numerous fine particles which each<br>
were formed from a mixture comprising Cefditoren pivoxil and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The fine particles present in the resulting yellow-<br>
colored powder were examined by a powder X-ray diffraction<br>
analyzer (Geigerflex 2 027, made by Rigaku Denki K.K.), to<br>
obtain a chart of the powder X-ray diffraction of said fine<br>
particles. The result of an analysis of the pattern of the<br>
resulting X-ray diffraction chart indicated that no peak was<br>
seen in the angle of diffraction in the chart, and that the<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil component present in the fine particles<br>
was in the form of the amorphous substance.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose<br>
plus hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 2 % (by weight) on the basis of the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component.<br>
Further, the aqueous solution of hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose which had been used for the washing operation of<br>
the precipitate as collected from the neutralization reaction<br>
mixture mentioned in the above was then wholly recovered after<br>
the washing operation. A measurement was then made of the<br>
total residual amount of the hydroxypropyl cellulose remaining<br>
in the aqueous solution of hydroxypropyl cellulose which had<br>
been used in the washing operation and then recovered as above.<br>
The total residual amount so measured of the hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose present in the so recovered aqueous solution after<br>
the washing step was observed to be significantly less than<br>
the initial, total amount of hydroxylpropyl cellulose which<br>
was initially contained in the aqueous solution of<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose as just charged in the washing step.<br>
Based on this observed fact, it was deduced that, during the<br>
washing operation of the precipitate, an amount of the<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose component present as the solute in<br>
the washing aqueous solution had transferred into the<br>
precipitate, at least into the surface of the precipitate,<br>
from the washing aqueous solution of hydroxypropyl cellulose<br>
just employed in said washing step.<br>
Furthermore, when an examination was conducted, under<br>
an electron microscope (magnification x 10000), in respect<br>
of several ones of the fine particles as picked up from the<br>
resulting yellow-colored powder as above, it was shown that<br>
the surface of these fine particles had a simple and uniform<br>
texture or tissue, and further that in the surface of the fine<br>
particles, there was substantially not observed any presence<br>
of independently separate grains of Cefditoren pivoxil or any<br>
presence of independently separate grains of hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose or of hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
Example 5<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (50<br>
g) was dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution (350 ml)<br>
containing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (500 mg) as<br>
dissolved therein and HCl at a concentration of 1N, at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C, and with taking the time over a period<br>
of 45 minutes for the dissolution of Cefditoren pivoxil. The<br>
resulting aqueous solution was filtered through a millipore<br>
(1 µm) membrane filter to remove the insoluble solid matters<br>
from the solution. Thus, there was prepared an acidic aqueous<br>
solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxylpropyl-<br>
methyl cellulose completely dissolved therein, as well as<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
The resulting acidic aqueous solution here obtained<br>
was then neutralized to a pH of 3 .3 by a dropwise slow addition<br>
of a 1N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (315 ml), and then<br>
to a pH of 7.0 by a slow addition of a 1N aqueous sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate solution (43.5 ml), while the temperature of the<br>
resulting reaction solution was maintained at 5 °C or below.<br>
The total period of time taken for the dropwise addition of<br>
the aqueous solutions of the inorganic bases was 1.5 hours<br>
to the completion.<br>
During the neutralization reaction, precipitate<br>
slowly deposited. The resulting neutralization reaction<br>
solution containing the precipitate as formed was then stirred<br>
overnight at a temperature of 5 °C or lower, and then the<br>
reaction solution was again adjusted to its pH of 7.0 by a<br>
dropwise addition of an aqueous 1N sodium hydrogen carbonate<br>
solution.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture here obtained as<br>
above was filtered to recover the precipitate therefrom. The<br>
resulting precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution<br>
of 0.5 % (by weight) of hydroxypropyl cellulose (150 ml). The<br>
precipitate so washed was then dried under a reduced pressure.<br>
There was thus obtained 48.5 g of a yellow-colored powder (the<br>
composition of this invention) consisting essentially of<br>
numerous fine particles which each were substantially formed<br>
from a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil substance and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose<br>
plus hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 1.1 % (by weight) on the basis of the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component.<br>
The fine particles present in the resulting yellow-<br>
colored powder were placed in a powder X-ray diffraction<br>
analyzer for an examination thereof. The result of analysis<br>
of the pattern of the X-ray diffraction chart so obtained<br>
indicated that no peak was seen in the angle of diffraction<br>
in the chart, and therefore that the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component contained in the fine particles was present in the<br>
form of the amorphous substance. Further, when an examination<br>
was made under an electron microscope in respect of several<br>
ones of the fine particles so obtained, it was shown that the<br>
surface of the particles had a simple uniform texture, and<br>
that there was substantially not observed the presence of any<br>
independently separate grains in the surface of the fine<br>
particles.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles present in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, while the surface layer of<br>
said fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture<br>
comprising the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
The procedure of Example 5 was repeated in the<br>
substantially same manner as in Example 5, except that the<br>
use of both the hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydroxy-<br>
propyl cellulose was completely omitted. In other words, the<br>
crystalline substance of Cef ditoren pivoxil (5 g) was dissolved<br>
in water (50 ml) containing 1N HCl, with taking a period of<br>
23 minutes for the dissolution of Cefditoren pivoxil, while<br>
the temperature of the solution was maintained at 5 °C or lower.<br>
After the completion of the dissolution of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
in the acidic water, an aqueous 1N sodium hydroxide solution<br>
(40 ml) was slowly added dropwise to the resulting acidic<br>
aqueous solution of Cefditoren pivoxil to neutralize the<br>
latter solution to a pH of 2.1. Then, an aqueous 1N sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate solution (10 ml) was added dropwise to the<br>
aqueous solution of Cefditoren pivoxil to neutralize the<br>
solution further. During the neutralization step, the<br>
reaction solution was maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or<br>
lower. Total time taken for the completion of the addition<br>
of these aqueous solutions of the inorganic bases was 27<br>
minutes.<br>
The resulting neutralization reaction mixture<br>
containing the precipitate as formed (pH 6.2) was stirred for<br>
1.5 hours at a temperature of 5 °C or lower, and then was<br>
neutralized further to a pH of 7.0 by a dropwise addition of<br>
an aqueous 1N sodium hydrogen carbonate solution.<br>
During the latter neutralization reaction step,<br>
precipitate of Cefditoren pivoxil deposited from the aqueous<br>
solution. The neutralization reaction mixture obtained here<br>
was stirred at a temperature of 5 °C or lower overnight.<br>
The here obtained neutralization reaction mixture<br>
containing the precipitate was filtered to recover the<br>
deposited precipitate. The precipitate so collected was<br>
washed well with water (25 ml) as cooled to 5 °C. The<br>
precipitate so washed was dried to afford a fine powder (4.4<br>
g) which was formed of a crystalline substance of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil. The fine particles present in said fine powder was<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer, to indicate<br>
that a peak was appearing in the angle of diffraction in the<br>
pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction chart. It was thus<br>
deduced that the Cefditoren pivoxil component contained in<br>
the fine powder obtained here was present in the form of a<br>
crystalline substance.<br>
Example 6<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (50<br>
g) was dissolved over 45 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(350 ml) containing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (500 mg)<br>
as dissolved therein and HC1 at a concentration of 1N at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or lower. The resulting aqueous solution<br>
containing Cefditoren pivoxil was filtered through amillipore<br>
(1 µm) membrane filter to remove the insoluble solid matters<br>
therefrom. Thus, there was prepared an acidic aqueous<br>
solution in which Cefditoren pivoxil, hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose and hydrochloric acid were completely dissolved.<br>
The acidic aqueous solution obtained here was<br>
neutralized to a pH of 7.0 by a dropwise slow addition of a<br>
1N aqueous ammonia, namely an aqueous solution of 1N ammonium<br>
hydroxide (331 ml), while the acidic aqueous solution was<br>
maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower. The total time<br>
taken for the completion of the dropwise addition of the<br>
aqueous ammonia was 1.5 hours. During this neutralization<br>
reaction, precipitate slowly deposited. The resulting<br>
neutralization reaction mixture containing the precipitate<br>
as formed was then stirred overnight at a temperature of 5 °C<br>
or lower. Then, the pH of the reaction mixture was again<br>
adjusted to a pH of 7.0 by a dropwise addition of a 1N aqueous<br>
ammonia.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture here obtained as<br>
above was filtered to recover the precipitate therefrom. The<br>
resulting precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution<br>
of 0.5 % (by weight) of hydroxypropyl cellulose (150 ml) . The<br>
precipitate so washed was then dried under a reduced pressure.<br>
There was thus obtained 48.8 g of a yellow-colored powder (the<br>
composition of this invention) consisting essentially of<br>
numerous fine particles which each were formed substantially<br>
from a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The fine particles present in the resulting yellow-<br>
colored powder was analyzed by a high performance liquid<br>
chromatography, to detect that the fine particles had a content<br>
of 96 % (by weight) of the Cefditoren pivoxil component based<br>
on the weight of the fine particles. Further, the total<br>
content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose plus hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose contained in the fine particles was calculated to<br>
be 1.3 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component.<br>
The fine particles present in the resulting yellow-<br>
colored powder were placed in and examined by the powder X-ray<br>
diffraction analyzer (Geigerflex 2027, made by Rigaku Denki<br>
K.K. ) , to give a chart of the powder X-ray diffraction of said<br>
fine particles. The result of analysis of the pattern of the<br>
X-ray diffraction chart revealed that no peak was seen in the<br>
angle of diffraction in the chart, and therefore that the<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil component contained in the fine particles<br>
was present in the form of the amorphous substance. Further,<br>
the examination was made under an electron microscope in<br>
respect of several ones of the fine particles, it was shown<br>
that the surface of the fine particles had a simple and uniform<br>
texture and further that any independently separate grains<br>
are substantially absent in the surface of the fine particles.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles present in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose, while the surface layer of the fine<br>
particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising the<br>
amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropyl-<br>
methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
A diffraction chart of the powder X-ray diffraction<br>
which was given by measuring the fine particles of the<br>
yellow-colored powder as produced in this Example in the powder<br>
X-ray diffraction analyzer (Geigerflex 2027, made by Rigaku<br>
Denki K. K.), is shown in Figure 1 of the attached drawings.<br>
An infrared absorption spectrum (measured by the<br>
pelleted KBr method) of the amorphous substance of Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil present in the fine particles just mentioned above<br>
was also measured by placing said fine particles in an infrared<br>
spectrometer.<br>
The chart of the infrared absorption spectrum thus<br>
obtained is shown in Figure 2a of the attached drawings. An<br>
infrared absorption spectrum was similarly measured for the<br>
crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil used in this<br>
Example as the starting material, and the measured chart<br>
thereof is also shown in Figure 2b of the attached drawings.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
The procedure of Example 6 was repeated in substantially<br>
the same manner as in Example 6, except that the use of both<br>
of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose<br>
was omitted.<br>
Namely, Cefditoren pivoxil in the form of a crystalline<br>
substance(20 g) was dissolved over 3 hours in a volume of water<br>
(190 ml) containing HC1 at a concentration of 1N, at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or lower. After the completion of the<br>
dissolution of Cefditoren pivoxil in the acidified water, the<br>
resulting aqueous solution was filtered through a millipore<br>
(1.0 µm) membrane filter. The resulting acidic aqueous<br>
solution containing Cefditoren pivoxil was then neutralized<br>
to a pH of 6.03 by a dropwise slow addition of a 1N aqueous<br>
ammonia (192 ml), while the acidic solution was maintained<br>
at a temperature of 5 °C or lower. The resulting<br>
neutralization reaction mixture containing the precipitate<br>
as formed (pH 6.03) was stirred overnight at a temperature<br>
of 5 °C or lower, and then 1N aqueous ammonia was again added<br>
dropwise to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to pH 5.8.<br>
During this step of the neutralization reaction, precipitate<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil deposited from the aqueous solution.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture obtained here was stirred<br>
at a temperature of 5 °C or lower overnight.<br>
The resultant neutralization reaction mixture<br>
containing the precipitate was filtered to recover the<br>
deposited precipitate. The collected precipitate was washed<br>
well with cold water at 5 °C (60ml). The precipitate so washed<br>
was dried to afford a fine powder (19.4 g) which was formed<br>
of a crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil. The<br>
resulting fine powder obtained here was examined by the powder<br>
X-ray diffraction analyzer, to indicate that a peak was<br>
appearing in the angle of diffraction in the pattern of the<br>
X-ray diffraction chart so obtained.  It is thus confirmed that<br>
the Cefditoren pivoxil component contained in the resulting<br>
fine particles was present in the crystalline substance form.<br>
Example 7<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved over 16 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(35 ml) containing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (50 mg) as<br>
dissolved therein and HC1 at a concentration of 1N, at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or lower. Thus, there was prepared an<br>
acidic aqueous solution (pH 0.8) in which Cefditoren pivoxil,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydrochloric acid were<br>
completely dissolved.<br>
The resulting acidic aqueous solution was neutralized<br>
to a pH of 6.7 by a dropwise slow addition of a 1N aqueous<br>
ammonia (about 34 ml), while the acidic aqueous solution was<br>
maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower. The time taken<br>
for the completion of the dropwise addition of the aqueous<br>
ammonia was 33 minutes. During the neutralization reaction,<br>
precipitate slowly deposited. The resulting neutralization<br>
reaction mixture containing the precipitate as formed was<br>
stirred overnight at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture obtained here was<br>
filtered to collect the precipitate. The resulting precipitate<br>
was washed well with an aqueous solution of a 0.5 % (by weight)<br>
of hydroxypropyl cellulose (75 ml). The precipitate so washed<br>
was then dried under a reduced pressure. There was thus<br>
obtained 4.8 g of a yellow-colored powder (the composition<br>
of this invention) consisting essentially of numerous fine<br>
particles which each were formed substantially from a<br>
homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 1.1 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component.<br>
The fine particles obtained here were placed in and<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer. The result<br>
of analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was seen in the angle of<br>
diffraction, and therefore that the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component contained in the fine particles was present in the<br>
form of the amorphous substance.  Further, an examination was<br>
made under an electron microscope in respect of several ones<br>
of the fine particles to show that the surface of the fine<br>
particles had a simple and uniform phase or texture.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles present in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose, while the surface layer of the fine<br>
particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising the<br>
amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
Example 8<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5g)<br>
was dissolved over 10 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(35 ml) containing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (100 mg) as<br>
dissolved therein and HCl at a concentration of 1N, at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or lower. Thus, there was prepared an<br>
acidic aqueous solution (pH 0.7) in which Cefditoren pivoxil,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydrochloric acid were<br>
completely dissolved.<br>
The acidic aqueous solution obtained here was<br>
neutralized to a pH of 7.0 by a dropwise slow addition of a<br>
1N aqueous ammonia (about 34 ml), while the acidic aqueous<br>
solution being maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The time taken for the completion of the dropwise addition<br>
of the aqueous ammonia was 3 0 minutes. During the<br>
neutralization reaction, precipitate slowly deposited. The<br>
so obtained neutralization reaction solution containing the<br>
precipitate was stirred at a temperature of 5 °C or lower<br>
overnight.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture obtained as above<br>
was filtered to collect the precipitate. The resulting<br>
precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution of 0.5 %<br>
(by weight) of hydroxypropyl cellulose (15 ml). The<br>
precipitate so washed was then dried under a reduced pressure.<br>
There was thus obtained 5 g of a yellow-colored powder (the<br>
composition of this invention) consisting essentially of<br>
numerous fine particles which each were formed substantially<br>
from a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose plus<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 2.0 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component.<br>
The fine particles obtained were placed in and<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer.  The result<br>
of analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was appearing in the angle of<br>
diffraction, and therefore that the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component contained in the fine particles was present in the<br>
form of the amorphous substance.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles present in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose, but the surface layer of the fine<br>
particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising the<br>
amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, hydroxypropyl-<br>
methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
Example 9<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved over 10 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(35 ml) containing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (40 mg) as<br>
dissolved therein and HC1 at a concentration of 1N at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or lower.  Thus, there was prepared an<br>
acidic aqueous solution (pH 0.4) in which Cefditoren pivoxil,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydrochloric acid were<br>
completely dissolved.<br>
The resulting acidic aqueous solution obtained here<br>
was neutralized to a pH of 6.9 by a dropwise slow addition<br>
of a 1N aqueous ammonia (about 34 ml), while the acidic aqueous<br>
solution being maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The time taken for the completion of the dropwise addition<br>
of the aqueous ammonia was 3 0 minutes. During the<br>
neutralization reaction, precipitate slowly deposited. The<br>
resulting neutralization reaction solution containing the<br>
precipitate as formed was stirred overnight at a temperature<br>
of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture obtained as above<br>
was then filtered to collect the precipitate. The resulting<br>
precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution of 0.5 %<br>
(by weight) of hydroxypropyl cellulose (15 ml). The<br>
precipitate so washed was then dried under a reduced pressure.<br>
There was thus obtained 5 g of a yellow-colored powder (the<br>
composition of this invention) consisting essentially of<br>
numerous fine particles which each were formed substantially<br>
from a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose<br>
and hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 1.1 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component.<br>
The fine particles thus obtained were placed in and<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer. The result<br>
of analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was appearing in the angle of<br>
diffraction, and therefore that the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component contained in the fine particles was present in the<br>
form of the amorphous substance.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles present in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, but the surface layer of the<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
Example 10<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved over 10 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(35 ml) containing hydroxypropyl cellulose (50 mg) as<br>
dissolved therein and HCl at a concentration of 1N at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or lower. Thus, there was prepared an<br>
acidic aqueous solution (pH 0.7) in which Cefditoren pivoxil,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydrochloric acid were completely<br>
dissolved.<br>
The resulting acidic aqueous solution obtained here<br>
was neutralized to a pH of 6.7 by a dropwise slow addition<br>
of a 1N aqueous ammonia (about 34 ml), while the acidic aqueous<br>
solution being maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The time taken for the completion of the dropwise addition<br>
of the aqueous ammonia was 36 minutes. During the<br>
neutralization reaction, precipitate slowly deposited. The<br>
resulting neutralization reaction solution containing the<br>
precipitate as formed was stirred overnight at a temperature<br>
of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture obtained as above<br>
was filtered to collect the precipitate. The resulting<br>
precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution of 0.5 %<br>
(by weight) of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (15 ml). The<br>
precipitate so washed was then dried under a reduced pressure.<br>
There was thus obtained 5 g of a yellow-colored powder (the<br>
composition of this invention) consisting essentially of<br>
numerous fine particles which each were formed substantially<br>
from a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 1 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component.<br>
The fine particles thus obtained were placed in and<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer. The result<br>
of analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was appearing in the angle of<br>
diffraction in said chart, and therefore that the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component contained in the fine particles was present<br>
in the form of the amorphous substance.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles present in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxy-<br>
propyl cellulose, but the surface layer of the fine particles<br>
is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, hydroxypropyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
Example 11<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved over 10 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(35 ml) containing hydroxypropyl cellulose (50 mg) as<br>
dissolved therein and HC1 at a concentration of 1N at a<br>
temperature of 5 °C or lower. Thus, there was prepared an<br>
acidic aqueous solution (pH 0.3) in which Cefditoren pivoxil,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydrochloric acid were completely<br>
dissolved.<br>
The resulting acidic aqueous solution obtained here<br>
was neutralized to a pH of 6.9 by a dropwise slow addition<br>
of a 1N aqueous ammonia (about 34.5 ml), while the acidic<br>
aqueous solution being maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or<br>
lower. The time taken for the completion of the dropwise<br>
addition of the aqueous ammonia was 43 minutes. During the<br>
neutralization reaction, precipitate slowly deposited. The<br>
resulting neutralization reaction solution containing the<br>
precipitate as formed was stirred at a temperature of 5 °C or<br>
lower overnight.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture obtained as above<br>
was filtered to collect the precipitate. The resulting<br>
precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution of 0.5 %<br>
(by weight) of methyl cellulose (15 ml). The precipitate so<br>
washed was then dried under a reduced pressure. There was thus<br>
obtained 4.9 g of a yellow-colored powder (the composition<br>
of this invention) consisting essentially of numerous fine<br>
particles which each were formed substantially from a<br>
homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropyl cellulose and<br>
methyl cellulose contained in the fine particles present in<br>
the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated to be 1 %<br>
(by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component.<br>
The fine particles thus obtained were placed in and<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer. The result<br>
of analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was appearing in the angle of<br>
diffraction in said chart, and therefore that the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component contained in the fine particles was present<br>
in the form of the amorphous substance.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles contained in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxy-<br>
propyl cellulose, but the surface layer of the fine particles<br>
is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, hydroxypropyl cellulose and<br>
methyl cellulose.<br>
Example 12<br>
The crystalline substance (5 g) was dissolved over<br>
10 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution (35 ml) containing<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (50 mg) as dissolved therein<br>
and 1N-HC1 at a temperature of 5 °C or lower. Thus, there was<br>
prepared an acidic aqueous solution (pH 1.1) in which<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and<br>
hydrochloric acid were completely dissolved.<br>
The resulting acidic aqueous solution obtained here<br>
was neutralized to a pH of 7.0 by a dropwise slow addition<br>
of a 1N aqueous ammonia (about 34 ml), while the acidic aqueous<br>
solution being maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The time taken for the completion of the dropwise addition<br>
of the aqueous ammonia was 50 minutes. During the neut-<br>
ralization reaction, precipitate slowly deposited.  The<br>
resulting neutralization reaction solution containing the<br>
precipitate as formed was stirred at a temperature of 5 °C or<br>
lower overnight.<br>
The neutralization reaction mixture here obtained as<br>
above was filtered to collect the precipitate. The resulting<br>
precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution of 0.5 %<br>
(by weight) of hydroxypropyl cellulose (15 ml). The<br>
precipitate so washed was then dried under a reduced pressure.<br>
There was thus obtained 4.9 g of a yellow-colored powder (the<br>
composition of this invention) consisting essentially of<br>
numerous fine particles which each were formed substantially<br>
from a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose<br>
and hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 1.1 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component.<br>
The fine particles thus obtained were placed in and<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer. The result<br>
of analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was appearing in the angle of<br>
diffraction in the chart, and therefore that the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component contained in the fine particles was present<br>
in the form of the amorphous substance.<br>
It is deemed that the fine particles contained in the<br>
yellow-colored powder as obtained in this Example have such<br>
structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxy-<br>
propylmethyl cellulose, but the surface layer of the fine<br>
particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising the<br>
amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose.<br>
Example 13<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved over 16 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(35 ml) containing methyl cellulose (50 rag) as dissolved<br>
therein and HC1 at a concentration of 1N, at a temperature<br>
of 5 °C or lower. Thus, there were prepared an acidic aqueous<br>
solution (pH 0.4) in which Cefditoren pivoxil, methyl<br>
cellulose and hydrochloric acid were completely dissolved.<br>
The resulting acidic aqueous solution obtained here<br>
was neutralized to a pH of 6.7 by a dropwise slow addition<br>
of a 1N aqueous ammonia (about 34 ml), while the acidic aqueous<br>
solution being maintained at a temperature of 5 °C or lower.<br>
The time taken for the completion of the dropwise addition<br>
of the aqueous ammonia was 40 minutes. During the<br>

of Cefditoren pivoxil and methyl cellulose.<br>
The total content of methyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose contained in the fine particles<br>
present in the resulting yellow-colored powder was calculated<br>
to be 2 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component.<br>
The fine particles thus obtained were placed in and<br>
examined by the powder X-ray diffraction analyzer. The result<br>
of analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was appearing in the angle of<br>
diffraction in the chart, and therefore that the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil component contained in the fine particles was present<br>

structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and methyl<br>
cellulose, but the surface layer of the fine particles is formed<br>
of a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance<br>
of Cefditoren pivoxil, methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose.<br>
Example 14<br>
The crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (5 g)<br>
was dissolved over 10 minutes in an acidic aqueous solution<br>
(35 ml) containing methyl cellulose (50 mg) as dissolved<br>
therein and HC1 at a concentration of 1N at a temperature of<br>

precipitate was washed well with an aqueous solution of 0.5 %<br>
(by weight) of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (15 ml). The<br>
precipitate so washed was then dried under a reduced pressure.<br>
There was thus obtained 4.9 g of a yellow-colored powder (the<br>

1.1 % (by weight) based on the weight of the Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
component.<br>
The fine particles thus obtained were placed in and<br>

It is deemed that the fine particles contained in the<br>

structure that the central portion or core portion of these<br>
fine particles is formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising<br>
the amorphous substance of Cefditoren pivoxil and methyl<br>
cellulose, but the surface layer of the fine particles is<br>
formed of a homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous<br>
substance of Cefditoren pivoxil, methyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.<br>
Test Example 1<br>
There was taken as a sample one gram of the<br>
yellow-colored powder (the composition of this invention),<br>
which was obtained in Example 6 above, and which consisted<br>
essentially of the particles as formed substantially from a<br>
homogeneous mixture comprising the amorphous substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and in<br>
which the surface layer of said particles contained<br>
additionally hydroxypropyl cellulose. The sample so taken<br>
was placed in 250 ml of an acidic water (pH 1.2) containing<br>
about 1N HC1 at 3 7 °C and stirred at 3 7 °C for 2 hours. The<br>
resulting aqueous solution was passed through a millipore<br>
(1 µm) membrane filter to remove the insoluble solid therefrom.<br>
The transparent aqueous solution here obtained, which<br>
contained Cefditoren pivoxil and the water-soluble cellulose<br>
derivatives above-mentioned as dissolved therein, was then<br>
measured in respect of the concentration of the Cefditoren<br>
pivoxil. By this measuring test, the amorphous substance of<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil contained in said yellow-colored powder<br>
was found to have a solubility of at least 4 mg/ml in said<br>
acidic water at 37 °C .<br>
On the other hand, a test similar to that given in the<br>
above was carried out to measure the solubility of the<br>
crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil (the orthorhomic<br>
crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil as obtained in<br>
Example 1 of the PCT application International Open-Laying<br>
Publication NO.W098/12200), which was used as the starting<br>
material. This crystalline substance of Cefditoren pivoxil<br>
was found to have a solubility of only about 0.4 mg/ml in the<br>
above-mentioned acidic water at 3 7 °C.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
Five grams of the yellow-colored powdery composition<br>
as obtained in the above Example 6 were placed in a sealed<br>
container and then stored therein at 4 0 °C under an atmosphere<br>
of dry air for 4 months. After the storage, the yellow-colored<br>
powdery composition was taken out from the container, and<br>
measured for its X-ray diffraction in the powder X-ray<br>
diffraction analyzer same as that used in Example 6. An<br>
analysis of the pattern of the resulting X-ray diffraction<br>
chart indicated that no peak was appearing in the angle of<br>
diffraction in the chart. It was thus found that the<br>
Cefditoren pivoxil contained in the fine particles present<br>
in the above-mentioned yellow-colored powder, even after its<br>
storage at 40 °C for 4 months, could remain in the form of the<br>
amorphous substance and therefore has a crystallographical<br>
stability.<br>

essentially of the particles as formed from a homogeneous<br>

can exhibit a high therapeutic efficacy when administered<br>
orally.<br>
