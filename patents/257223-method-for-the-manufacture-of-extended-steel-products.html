				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present method relates to a method for the manufacture of extended steel products.<br>
When manufacturing tape, wire and sheet products from steel, these are manufactured as extended products. The surfaces of the products are contaminated during the manufacture by oils and by organic and/or inorganic particles that are dissolved or suspended in the oils.<br>
The oils may be emulsions, roller oils, polymers, lubricants, etc. The organic particles may be carbon or carbon compounds. Inorganic particles may be particles of steel, oxides, etc.<br>
Such an oil film causes quality problems in later process steps if it is not removed. For this reason, such oil residues are currently removed with the aid of solvents in washing stages, before the product is transferred to a subsequent treatment, such as, a heating furnace or a heat-treatment furnace.<br>
This means that the process line becomes longer and more expensive than would be the case if it was not necessary to wash away the oil film. Furthermore, the washing stage results- in- the-manufacturer-receiving- a- residual- product, which may be classified as harmful to the environment, from the wash.<br>
The present invention solves this problem.<br>
The present invention thus relates to a method for the manufacture of extended steel products, following the shaping of<br><br>
the product by working, but before the subsequent treatment of the steel product, whereby the steel, product is contaminated by oils and by at least one of organic and inorganic particles that are suspended or dissolved in the oils, and it is characterised in that burners are caused to emit exhaust gases that are caused to interact directly with the surface of the steel product, in that the burners are caused to be driven by an oxidant that contains at least 80% oxygen by weight percentage, whereby oils that are present on. the said products are vaporised and combusted, and in that the exhaust gases are caused to interact with the surface of the steel product with a speed that is sufficiently high to blow away organic and/or inorganic particles from the surface of the steel product.<br>
The invention is described in more detail below, partially in association with embodiments of the invention shown in the attached drawing, where<br>
- Figure 1 shows a burner and a steel product '- Figure 2 shows a part of the processing line with burners<br>
Figure 3 shows a part of an other processing' line with burners.<br>
The invention is described below in association with process-particular processing line or any particular steel products. It can be applied in any form of processing lines and for any type of extended steel products. Due to the equipment required to carry out the present method still being relatively compact, it can be introduced into an existing processing line, preferably one in which the steel product is to be heated for a subsequent, treatment.<br><br>
The present method concerns the manufacture of extended steel products lr following shaping of the steel product through working, but before further treatment of the steel product. The product is often at this time contaminated by oils and by inorganic particles dissolved in these oils. This is illustrated by the 'film 2 in Figure 1.<br>
According to the invention, the burner 3 emits exhaust gases 4 that are caused to interact directly with the surface of the steel product 1. The term "exhaust gases" is here used to denote combustion products and gas components that have not yet been combusted that leave the burners. The burners are caused to be driven by an oxidant that contains at least 80% oxygen gas by weight percentage, whereby oils 2 that are present on the said products are vaporised and combusted. Furthermore, the exhaust gas 4 is caused to interact with the surface of the steel product 1 with a speed that is sufficiently high to blow away inorganic particles from the surface of the steel product.<br>
The oxidant normally consists of oxygen gas together with argon and nitrogen gas. The fuel is a gaseous fuel, and it may be propane, butane, hydrogen gas, natural gas, etc.<br>
The present principle is to.-achieve..a. .rapid evaporation-of- ... the contaminants through a very rapid heating of the steel surface, and the contaminant layer, and an immediate combustion of the'gases that are thus formed without overheating the material itself. This is achieved by the use of burners designed for the purpose, which burners are driven by an oxidant that contains more than 80% oxygen gas and which deliver through their design heat and an excess of oxygen to<br><br>
a region close to the surface. The products of the said combustion and the said particles that are not combusted will be transported away from the surface.<br>
Che excess of oxygen is to be sufficiently large that combustion of the oil film is to take place. The magnitude of the 5xcess of oxygen needs to be of the order or 10%.<br>
Thus, the result is a clean steel surface, where the oils .iave contributed to the heating of the steel product.<br>
very significant application of the present invention is during the manufacture of products that are to be galvanised or provided with an organic coating, such as a paint or polymer, in the said subsequent treatment.<br>
Figure 1 shows a burner 3, the exhaust gases 4 of which interact with the surface of the steel product. The product has an oil layer 2 at the left of the drawing. The oil layer and inorganic contaminants have been removed from the product at the right of the drawing.<br>
The arrow 13 in Figures 1-3 shows the direction of motion of the product.<br>
installed in an existing processing line with guide rollers 6 - 8 and a subsequent treatment unit 9 for the product 1. This illustrates that the burners can be installed at a freely chosen position prior to a treatment unit.<br>
Figure 3 shows burners 3 located in a unit 10 that is an auxiliary unit on a treatment unit 11.<br><br>
In order to ensure that inorganic particles are blown away, the exhaust gases 4 are caused to leave the burners 3 with a speed that is at least 25 metres/sec. The speed is normally of the order of magnitude of 100 rnetres/sec during operation.<br>
It will present one skilled in the arts with no difficulty to calculate the number of burners required and the dimensions that are required in order to achieve the interaction of the exhaust gases from the burners with the complete surface of the steel product with the speed specified.<br>
It is preferred that the burners 3 are caused to heat the steel product 1 to a temperature within the range 100 - 800 °C. It is, however, important not to heat the surface of the steel product to such a high temperature that any solid particles present can reattach to the surface of the steel.<br>
It is, however, preferred in certain cases that the burners are caused to heat the surface 12 of the steel product to a temperature that lies close to but does not exceed its melting point.<br>
With the aim of achieving the desired effect of combustion of .oils . and ..blowing, away., of .particles,.... it. is -.preferred .that the. distance between the outlet opening 5 of the burners 3 and ' the steel product 1 should be caused to be 50 - 250 millimetres. The outlet opening 5 of the burners thus has a diameter that does not exceed the said distance. A suitable diameter lies within the range approximately 10 - 15 millimetres.<br><br>
'he burners 3 may be, but do not need to be, located such ;hat the combustion products' impact the material at an angle ;hat is not 90° to the surface of the steel product.<br>
?he present invention makes it possible for the user to avoid operating a separate washing plant, which in turn removes the lecessity for handling solvents that harm the environment.<br>
The present process also makes it possible to avoid the formation of a residual product based on solvents, which in turn mist be destroyed in an approved facility.<br>
Furthermore, the energy content of the contaminant is used directly in the process.<br>
Furthermore, the exhaust gases that are generated from the combusted oils can be handled in exhaust gas treatment plants that already exist.<br>
A number of embodiments have been described above. The invention, however, can be varied with respect to the number of burners, and their locations and dimensions, in order to adapt it for the particular products.<br>
Thus, the present invention.is not to be regarded as being within the framework specified by the attached claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
