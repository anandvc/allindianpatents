These prior applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to megasonic processing apparatus and associated<br>
methods involving one or more piezoelectric transducers operating in thickness mode at<br>
megasonic frequencies of at least 300 KHz or higher, and relates more particularly to<br>
improving performance by sweeping the frequency of a driving signal throughout a<br>
predetermined or programmable frequency range that spans the resonant frequencies of<br>
all the transducers.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELEVANT ART<br>
Megasonic processing involves generating and using high frequency energy at<br>
frequencies above 300 KHz. Many megasonic systems operate at frequencies at or near<br>
1,000 KHz, or one megahertz. Although 1 MHz is the consensus, preferred frequency for<br>
many applications, the frequency range goes much higher, with frequencies as high as 10<br>
MHz. Typical uses for megasonic systems include cleaning delicate objects, such as<br>
semiconductor wafers and disc drive media. Such a megasonic cleaning process involves<br>
placing the objects to be cleaned in a fluid-filled tank, and applying vibrational energy at<br>
megaeonic frequencies to a radiating surface or surfaces of the tank. One or more<br>
piezoelectric transducers are used to generate the vibrational energy. A generator<br>
supplies an alternating current driving signal at the resonant frequency of the transducers.<br>
Megasomc transducers operate in thickness mode, where a piezoelectric element is<br>
excited by an alternating current driving signal that causes alternating expansion and<br><br>
contraction of the transducer, primarily expanding and contracting the thickness of the<br>
transducer. A piezoelectric transducer having a thickness of 0.080 inches has a<br>
fundamental, thickness mode, resonant frequency of 1,000 KHz.<br>
Megasonic processing has some similarities with ultrasonic processing, which<br>
involves lower fundamental frequencies, typically from about 25 KHz to about 192 KHz.<br>
Ultrasonic transducers are typically mass-balanced, with inert masses on either side of a<br>
piezoelectric element, and have a significant radial component of movement at right<br>
angles to the thickness component. One common construction of an ultrasonic transducer<br>
is to stack several layers of ring-shaped piezoelectric elements between two masses, and<br>
to hold the assembly together with an axial compression bolt. Ultrasonic cleaning is<br>
based on cavitation, which is the formation and collapse of bubbles in the fluid.<br>
At the frequencies used for megasonic cleaning, significant cavitation does not<br>
occur, so die cleaning action is based on another mechanism known as micro-streaming,<br>
which is a general flow of detached particles flowing away from the megasonic<br>
transducers. This flow consists of planar waves originating at the surface to which the<br>
transducers are mounted. The planar nature of these micro-streams affects the<br>
distribution of megasonic energy throughout the tank. One way to improve the<br>
distribution is to cover a high percentage of the surface area of the tank with transducers.<br>
Another but less efficient way is to oscillate or move the parts to be processed throughout<br>
die tank so that all surfaces are exposed to sufficiently high megasonic energy.<br>
It is known that radial-mode ultrasonic activity in a cleaning tank may benefit<br>
from a process of sweeping or varying the frequency of the driving signal. However,<br>
there has been an industry-wide belief that you cannot sweep megasonic frequencies<br>
because the sound waves are too small and weak for any benefit from sweeping. In<br>
addition, it has been thought that there would be no benefit from sweeping megasonic<br>
frequencies because of the thickness mode transducers and resultant planar nature of<br>
megasonic vibrations and due to the different cleaning mechanisms at work as compared<br>
to ultrasonics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a megasonic processing apparatus and method<br>
having one or more piezoelectric transducers (PZT) operating in thickness mode at<br>
megasonic frequencies in excess of 300 KHz. A megasonic generator operating at<br><br>
megasonic frequencies drives the transducers with a variable-frequency driving signal<br>
that varies or sweeps throughout a predetermined or programmable sweep frequency<br>
range. The megasonic generator generates the driving signal at megasonic frequencies to<br>
energize the megasonio piezoelectric transducers to cause them to vibrate in thickness<br>
mode at their megasonic resonant frequencies. The piezoelectric transducers emit energy<br>
at the megaeonic frequencies that can be used for various applications, such as cleaning<br>
objects in a fluid-filled tank. The generator repeatedly varies or sweeps the frequency of<br>
the driving signal through a sweep frequency range that includes the resonant frequencies<br>
of all the megaeonic piezoelectric transducers.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention involves grouping the megasonic<br>
piezoelectric transducers into groups having similar resonant frequencies, and powering<br>
each group with a separate frequency-sweeping driving signal from a generator operating<br>
within a sweep frequency Tange that includes the resonant frequencies of the group of<br>
associated transducers. This subdivides the overall sweep frequency range into smaller<br>
subranges, which may or may not overlap, and reduces the range of each frequency<br>
sweep. The effect of grouping transducers is to proportionately increase the amount of<br>
time mat any particular transducer is operating at or close to its resonant frequency and<br>
thereby improve efficiency.<br>
The present invention encompasses a megasonic system that includes one or more<br>
piezoelectric transducers and one or more megasonic generators coupled to the<br>
transducers for supplying varying-frequency megasonic driving signals at selectable or<br>
programmable frequency ranges and sweep rates.<br>
When a megasonic process is used, for example, for cleaning silicon wafers or<br>
disc drive media, sweeping the driving signal through me resonant frequencies of all the<br>
thickness-mode megasonic transducers will equalize the megasonic energy generated by<br>
the transducers and will cause the transducers to perform in unison. This results in a<br>
more uniform distribution of megasonic energy and improved performance. The same<br>
improved megasonic energy uniformity and functionality can also be achieved in liquid<br>
processing, non-destructive testing, medical imaging, and other processes using<br>
megasonic thickness-mode transducers by sweeping the range of resonant frequencies of<br>
the transducers. The frequency sweeping process will also extend the life of the<br>
megasonic transducers because it is less stressful to the transducers than operating at a<br>
single fixed frequency. The frequency sweeping process also improves the uniformity of<br><br>
megasonic energy throughout the tank or other apparatus because each transducer<br>
operates at its resonant frequency during at least part of each frequency sweeping cycle.<br>
It is expected feat any application of process using megsonic frequencies will benefit<br>
from fee uniform distribution of power created by sweeping fee driving signal through all<br>
the transducers' resonant frequencies.<br>
A key to optimizing efficiency of a megasonic process is to have uniform energy<br>
throughout fee radiating surface being excited wife megasonics. To do this, preferably<br>
80% or more of the area of fee radiating surface is covered by thickness-mode megasonic<br>
transducers. Furthermore, each megasonic transducer produces consistent megasonic<br>
energy by sweeping fee frequency of fee driving signal through the highest and lowest<br>
resonant frequencies of a group of transducers.<br>
For best performance, each megasonic transducer needs to be energized<br>
substantially the same as other megasonic transducers bonded to the same surface. To<br>
achieve this, the driving frequency is swept through fee resonant frequencies of all fee<br>
transducers. Sweeping the resonant frequencies of megasonic transducers drives every<br>
transducer at its resonant frequency at some point in each cycle. This creates uniformity<br>
in transducer performance not previously achieved in the industry.<br>
In addition, frequency sweeping of megasonic transducers reduces a "fountain<br>
effect" observed wife fixed-frequency megasonic transducers. The fountain effect is<br>
thought to be caused by a transducer operating at its resonant frequency wife a fixed<br>
frequency driving signal, which produces a significant up-surge of liquid in the tank<br>
above feat transducer. Sweeping fee megasonic frequency driving signal ensures that any<br>
particular transducer will not be driven continuously at its resonant frequency, feus<br>
eliminating fee upsurge associated wife fee fountain effect. Instead, the megasonic<br>
energy is uniformly distributed throughout the tank because all transducers are operating<br>
efficiently at their resonant frequencies at some point during each sweep cycle.<br>
Frequency sweeping is far more dramatic wife megasonic frequencies than<br>
ultrasonic frequencies like 40 KHz. Improvements in power distribution of 500 to 700 %<br>
have been seen wife megasonic resonant frequency sweeping and (his means substantially<br>
better processing.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The drawings depict various preferred embodiments of the present invention for<br>
purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the<br>
following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods<br>
illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention<br>
described herein.<br>
One aspect of the present invention is a megasonic processing apparatus and<br>
method having a megasonic generator with a programmable sweep frequency range and a<br>
programmable sweep rate. The sweep frequency range is the range of frequencies or<br><br>
bandwith within which the megasonic generator outputs a driving signal to drive one or<br>
more megasonic thickness-mode piezoelectric transducers at their resonant frequencies.<br>
The sweep rate is the number of times the resonant frequencies are swept per second.<br>
The megasonic generator preferably includes a controller or other controlling<br>
device with means to allow a user to select or program the sweep frequency range or<br>
bandwidth and the sweep rate for the driving signal. The user inputs one or more<br>
combinations of sweep frequency range and sweep rate into the memory device of the<br>
generator. The generator generates and outputs the driving signal according to the sweep<br>
frequency range and sweep rate selected by the user.<br>
When used in a cleaning application, for example, the megasonic piezoelectric<br>
transducer or transducers may be mounted on the bottom or sides of a tank, or enclosed in<br>
an immersible container within the tank.. The sweeping frequency generator may be used<br>
to drive megasonic transducers in applications other than cleaning. Preferably, the<br>
transducers are piezoelectric crystals or piezoelectric ceramic (also known as PZTs), such<br>
as barium titanate or lead zirconate titanate, operating in thickness mode. Using different<br>
sweep rates or sweep frequency ranges in the same process may enhance cleaning of<br>
some parts because certain frequencies may be more effective than others.<br>
A device that sweeps the frequency of the driving signal is incorporated into the<br>
megasonic generator that generates the driving signal. The generator includes a user<br>
interface that includes one or more input devices, such as knobs, dials, software,<br>
keyboard, graphical user interface, network connection, or other input devices, mat permit<br>
a user to set a sweep frequency range or bandwidth over which the generator operates and<br>
also to set a sweep rate at which the generator sweeps through the programmed range.<br>
The controls for user programming the sweep frequency range and sweep rate may be<br>
analog or digital.<br>
As shown in Figures 1-6, one embodiment of the present invention is a cleaning<br>
system 10 mat includes a quartz cleaning tank 12 containing a cleaning liquid or solution<br>
14 and one or more pieces 15 to be cleaned. Megasonic energy is supplied to the cleaning<br>
liquid 14 by one or more megasonic frequency transducers 16 affixed to the bottom of the<br>
tank 12. Alternatively, megasonic transducers could be affixed to one or more sides of<br>
the tank or immersed in the tank. Preferably, the megasonic transducer 16 has a<br>
piezoelectric dement (PZT) 18 adhesively bonded or otherwise attached to one side of a<br>
silicon carbide plate 20. The other side of the silicon carbide plate 20 is adhesively<br><br>
bonded or otherwise attached to the outside bottom surface of the cleaning tank 12.<br>
Preferably, bonding layers 22 between the silicon carbide plate 20 and the tank 12 and<br>
between the silicon carbide plate and the piezoelectric element 18 are composed of<br>
perforated copper foil and an impedance matching adhesive. Alternatively, the bonding<br>
layers may be composed of epoxy or other adhesive used for die bonding semiconductor<br>
chips to package substrates.<br>
The piezoelectric element can be square, rectangular, or a circular disk, or other<br>
shape having uniform thickness. For example, for operation at a nominal frequency of<br>
1,000 KHz, the piezoelectric element 18 would have a thickness of about 0.08 inches, the<br>
silicon carbide plate 20 would have a thickness of about 0.19 inches, and the bottom of<br>
the quartz tank 12 would have a thickness of about 0.20 inches. Transducer 16 and<br>
cleaning system 10 is just one example of a transducer and apparatus that incorporates the<br>
present invention.<br>
As shown in Figures 3-6, the transducers 16 are preferably rectangular in shape<br>
and are arranged parallel to each other. Preferably, the transducers 16 cover a substantial<br>
portion of the bottom surface of the tank 12, preferably at least 80%. It is desirable to<br>
generate megasonic energy and transfer it to the tank 12 and fluid 14 uniformly<br>
throughout the entire area of the surface to which the transducers 16 are attached.<br>
Covering a high percentage of the surface area of the tank bottom with transducers<br>
ensures that the megasonic energy transferred to the fluid 14 is relatively uniform.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the transducers 16 are driven by a driving signal supplied<br>
over electrical wires 24 by a programmable generator 26. The generator 26 is<br>
programmed by a user through a user input or interface 28 to set the sweep frequency<br>
range or bandwidth and the sweep rate of the driving signal output by the generator.<br>
A megasonic frequency piezoelectric transducer operates in thickness mode such<br>
that applied voltages cause the transducer to expand and contract in thickness. These<br>
expansions and contractions are transmitted through the silicon carbide resonator 20 and<br>
tank 12 to the fluid 14 and objects IS in the tank. As shown in Figure 6, these<br>
megaeonic-frequency vibrations are primarily horizontal waves 17, provided mat the<br>
transducers 16 are on the bottom of the tank 12. The waves propagate upwards and<br>
convey particles cleaned or separated from the objects 15 in the tank. This is a processed<br>
known at micro-streaming, in which there is a net movement upward, away from the<br>
source of megasonic energy. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the tank has a weir 21 over<br><br>
which excess fluid and particles flow, and a pump 23 and filter 25 to recirculate and clean<br>
the fluid.<br>
Resonant frequency is generally the frequency where the mechanical and<br>
electrical properties of a transducer can most efficiently transmit sound waves. In<br>
megaeonic transducers operating in thickness mode, the thickness of the transducer<br>
determines the resonant frequency. For example, a transducer that is 0.08 inches thick<br>
will have a resonant frequency of about 1,000 KHz. A transducer that is 0.065 inches<br>
thick will have a resonant frequency of about 1230 KHz. A transducer that is 0.050<br>
inches thick will have a resonant frequency of about 1600 KHz. The term "resonant<br>
frequency" is used herein to mean the lowest, fundamental frequency where the<br>
transducer as installed has a natural resonance.<br>
As stated above, a piezoelectric transducer having a thickness of 0.080 inches has<br>
a fundamental resonant frequency of 1,000 KHz. A tolerance on the thickness of such a<br>
transducer has a significant effect on the resonant frequency. A thickness variation of<br>
0.001 inch would cause a resonant frequency variance of 12.5 KHz. Also, the two major<br>
surfaces of the transducer should be flat and co-planar, but any variances can also affect<br>
the resonant frequency. Even though it is desirable from a performance standpoint for all<br>
transducers to have exactly the same resonant frequency, from a manufacturing tolerance<br>
standpoint, it is impractical. However, the frequency sweeping of the present invention<br>
overcomes this obstacle.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that sweeping the frequency of the<br>
driving signal through the resonant frequencies of all the transducers distributes the sound<br>
waves equally among the transducers. This makes it possible to have substantially equal<br>
megasonic energy throughout the tank. This is important because the thickness-mode<br>
transducers produce sound waves that travel vertically from the bottom to the top of the<br>
tank with little spreading in lateral directions. The even distribution of megasonic energy<br>
can best be achieved by sweeping just outside the highest and lowest resonant frequencies<br>
of the transducers.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that it accommodates tolerances in<br>
the resonant frequencies of the transducers. Performance is best if variances of the<br>
resonant frequency are minimized. Choosing transducers with exactly the tame resonant<br>
frequency will help minimize variances (although at increased cost), but even then there<br>
will be some variances from the adhesives or other binder miserable used to mount the<br><br>
transducers because any variation in thickness creates a variation in frequency with<br>
thickness mode applications. Sweeping the frequency of the driving signal according to<br>
the present invention accommodates such inevitable variations.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is that it reduces surges of fluid in<br>
the tank. Without sweeping the driving signal, the transducers at or closest to the<br>
frequency of the driving signal tend to create a powerful upward force that pushes the<br>
fluid upward, sometimes as much as two inches above the surface level. Such surface<br>
surges are a problem because they cause air to be incorporated into the fluid as it is<br>
recirculated, which can interfere with the megasonic process. Surges are also a problem<br>
because if the liquid is solvent it will evaporate in the air and can be harmful to the<br>
operator and or the people in the area, especially if the fluid is an acid or other hazardous<br>
material. Sweeping the driving signal with the present invention reduces these problems.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the generator 26 varies the frequency of the driving signal<br>
as a function of time. For example, the frequency of the driving signal may vary linearly<br>
in a saw-tooth pattern over a programmed sweep frequency range 30 that includes the<br>
resonant frequencies 31 of all the megasonic transducers 16. The sweep frequency range<br>
or bandwidth of the generator is programmed by a user and stored in a memory device<br>
associated with the generator 26. The rate at which the frequency varies is determined by<br>
the sweep rate programmed by the user and stored in the memory device of the generator.<br>
The generator can be programmed to vary the frequencies of the driving signal according<br>
to other functions or programs and need not be limited to linear functions that form a<br>
triangular wave or saw tooth pattern as shown in Figure 7. The variation in frequency can<br>
be, for example, sinusoidal, exponential, and other functions. The driving signal itself<br>
may be sinusoidal, square, triangular, or other wave shape. The sweep rates need not be<br>
the same for sweeping upwards (increasing frequency) aad downwards (decreasing<br>
frequency). Preferably, the user can also set the number of periods and can establish rest<br>
times when the generator shuts off the driving signal.<br>
In a cleaning application, some parts may be best cleaned by a single transducer<br>
instead of multiple transducers. In such a configuration, the performance of me<br>
transducer can be enhanced by using a programmed software program thai identifies the<br>
optimum resonant frequency and sweeps through this frequency within a defined range.<br>
For best results, the driving frequency can be swept through a sweep range of 1% or less<br>
to ensure mat the resonant frequency of the transducer is being excited repeatedly. A<br><br>
benefit of fee present invention is that it reduces the adverse effects of resonant frequency<br>
drifting because the resonant frequency of each transducer is being excited each cycle<br>
even if it changes with time, provided that the sweep range or bandwidth is wide enough.<br>
Commonly, multiple megasonic transducers 16 are used for a given task or<br>
process, in which case it is common to drive all transducers with the same generator and<br>
driving signal. Where multiple transducers are used, however, there may not be a single<br>
optimum frequency due to performance variations and manufacturing tolerances among<br>
the transducers. Production tolerances result in megasonic transducers having resonant<br>
frequencies within a 3% to 4% range. For example, at 1000 KHz, a 4% range would be<br>
plus or minus 20 KHz from the nominal 1000 KHz, or a range of 980 to 1020 KHz.<br>
In such applications, according to the present invention, it is appropriate to<br>
repeatedly sweep the frequency of the driving signal to ensure that at least some of the<br>
time the transducer 16 is operating at or near its resonant frequency. In order to have<br>
each transducer 16 operate at or near its resonant frequency, the generator sweeps through<br>
a predetermined sweep frequency range that is designed to reach the lowest and highest<br>
resonant frequencies 31 of the group of transducers. The sweeping frequency function of<br>
the generator 26 covers that range of variance. The frequency sweeping function can be<br>
fixed or it can be programmed to be variable as to speed (sweeps per second) or range<br>
(minimum and maximum frequencies).<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to grouping the megasonic<br>
piezoelectric transducers into multiple groups according to their resonant frequencies, and<br>
driving each group with a separate variable-frequency driving signal. Transducers with<br>
similar resonant frequencies are grouped together to reduce the range of frequencies<br>
through which the generator must sweep in order to operate the group of transducers at or<br>
near their resonant frequencies. Reducing the frequency range of the sweep increases the<br>
time that each transducer operates at or near its resonant frequency.<br>
As the range of sweep frequency coverage is reduced, the rate of sweep can be<br>
increased to create more activity if required by a particular application, or if the sweep<br>
rate remains the same, men the repetition rate is increased. The result is that the<br>
megasonic transmission at each transducer's resonant frequency will be greater since the<br>
sweep covers a shorter span and the transducer operates for a greater percentage of time<br>
at or near its resonant frequency, which increases the efficiency of the megasonic process.<br><br>
This point is illustrated in Figures 7, 8, and 9. In Figure 7, a single generator<br>
sweeps the driving signal between minimum and maximum frequencies over a range 30.<br>
In Figure 8, two generators are used to cover the same overall range, but each generator<br>
coven a subrange 32 that is one-half of the foil range 30. Half of the transducers have<br>
resonant frequencies 31' in the upper subrange 32', and the other half of the transducers<br>
have resonant frequencies 31" in the lower subrange 32". The number of sweeps per<br>
unit time is the same in Figures 7 and 8. In Figure 9, the rate of change of the sweeping<br>
frequency is the same as in Figure 7, but the range is cut in half so that twice as many<br>
sweeps occur in the same period of time.<br>
As an example of grouping, assume that twelve megasonic transducers are used in<br>
a process having the following nominal resonant frequencies (in KHz):<br>
1010	1030	1015	1007<br>
1019	1004	1027	1038<br>
1022	1014	1031	1040<br>
These frequencies range from a minimum of 1004 KHz to a maximum of 1040 KHz, for a<br>
total range of 36 KHz (±18 KHz) centered at 1022 KHz. Sweeping the frequency of the<br>
driving signal to include the resonant frequencies of all twelve transducers would require<br>
a total sweep of 36 KHz.<br>
These twelve transducers could be divided into two groups, A and B, to reduce the<br>
sweep range:<br>
Generator A		Generator B	<br>
1004	1014	1022	1031<br>
1007	1015	1027	1038<br>
1010	1019	1030	1040<br>
The tranaducers driven by Generator A range from 1004 KHz to 1019 KHz, for a total<br>
range of 15 KHz (±7.5 KHz) centered at 1011.5 KHz. The transducers' driven by<br>
Generator B range from 1022 KHz to 1040, for a total range of 18 KHz (±9 KHz)<br>
centered at 1031 KHz. By grouping the transducers according to their resonant<br>
frequencies and reducing the sweep range for each sweeping generator, the number of<br>
sweeps per unit time can be increased or the sweep rate can be decreased, either of which<br>
allows the transducers to be driven at or near their resonant frequencies more often, which<br>
enhances the megasonic process.<br><br>
In actual practice, the sweep frequency ranges are set slightly outside the<br>
maximum and minimum resonant frequencies for the associated transducers. So, in the<br>
example above, the sweep frequency range of Generator A might be set to 1003 to 1020<br>
KHz or 1002 to 1021 KHz and the sweep frequency range of Generator B might be set to<br>
1021 to 1041 KHz or 1020 to 1042 KHz. This ensures that each transducer operates both<br>
below and above its resonant frequency in each frequency sweep cycle and also allows<br>
for shifts of the resonant frequencies that may occur due to heating or other variables.<br>
Transducers can be grouped within an individual system or process or among<br>
multiple systems or processes operating simultaneously. For example if there are two<br>
teaks with multiple transducers each and bom tanks will be used simultaneously, one can<br>
group transducers from the larger universe of all transducers on the two tanks. Groupings<br>
may be further selected to produce a more uniform result as the transducers powered by a<br>
single generator do not have to be next to each other or used with the same tank to be in<br>
the group. Because all transducers work simultaneously, the designer of the transducer<br>
layout can focus on maximizing the efficiency of the grouping without regard to where<br>
the members of the groups are located.<br>
As an example of grouping among multiple, simultaneous processes, assume that<br>
the same twelve megasonic transducers set forth in the previous example are located on<br>
two different tanks:<br><br>
The twelve transducers of Tanks 1 and 2 are divided into two groups according to<br>
resonant frequencies and are driven by Generators A and B as follows (with the tank<br>
number shown in parentheses):<br><br>
Generator A drives four transducers of Tank 1 and two transducers of Tank 2. Generator<br>
B drives two transducers of Tank 1 and four transducers of Tank 2. Since all trasducers<br><br>
are operating at the same time, this grouping allows the two generators to sweep across<br>
smaller ranges.<br>
Thus, in cleaning and other processes where multiple tanks or systems are used,<br>
the entire population of transducers in multiple tanks or systems caa be combined to<br>
create an optimum assortment of frequencies to be grouped together, with each group<br>
powered by a different sweeping generator. For example in four processes using four<br>
tanks, transducers from any or all of the four tanks may be networked together to achieve<br>
the optimum range of frequencies for sweeping. Of course, all processes must be active<br>
at the same time for such grouping.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is the construction of the megasonic<br>
transducer 16 and its attachment to another structure, such as the bottom of tank 12, using<br>
a perforated metal layer and impedance matching adhesive. As shown in Figures 4 and 6,<br>
the megasonic transducer 16 preferably has a silicon carbide plate 20 between the<br>
piezoelectric element 18 and the surface of the cleaning tank 12 or other structure to<br>
which the transducer is attached. The piezoelectric element 18 is bonded to the silicon<br>
carbide plate 20, and the assembly is bonded to the tank 12 with bonding layers composed<br>
of a perforated metal foil, preferably copper, and an adhesive.<br>
The perforated copper (or other metal) foil improves flatness and uniformity of<br>
thickness of the bonding layer 22. The perforated copper has a predetermined thickness<br>
that allows the adhesive to be evenly distributed, thus avoiding irregularities or non-<br>
uniformity of adhesive thickness without using a jig or other stabilizing device. The<br>
perforated metal provides a controllable flat structure to maintain uniformity in thickness<br>
of the adhesive. The perforated metal also serves as an electrode between the<br>
piezoelectric element and the silicon carbide plate.<br>
The application of the present invention is not limited to cleaning operations. The<br>
same principle of sweeping the acoustical energy for megasonic transducers can be<br>
applied to other uses of micro-streeming of megasonic energy, such as non destructive<br>
testing, or any other applications using thickness mode transducers having fundamental<br>
resonant frequencies of at least 300 KHz. Sweeping megasonic transducers creates<br>
greater energy bursts, which create improved and stronger micro-streaming activity which<br>
improves the efficiency of micro-streaming cleaning and other uses of micro-streaming.<br>
Micro-streaming is a flow of energized liquid created by the release of ultrasonic energy<br><br>
that is too weak to cause cavitation. At frequencies in excess of 300 KHz, cavitations<br>
cease to exist but the megasonic frequency energy creates a flow of the liquid.<br>
From the above description, it will be apparent that the invention disclosed herein<br>
provides a novel and advantageous megasonic processing apparatus and method utilizing<br>
a variable frequency driving signal. The foregoing discussion discloses and describes<br>
merely exemplary methods and embodiments of the present invention. As will be<br>
understood by those familiar with the art, the invention may be embodied in various other<br>
