3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
GOLF BALL CONVEYING APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to golf ball conveying apparatuses which are provided in places such as indoor driving ranges to collect a golf ball, struck by a golfer, and place the golf ball onto a golf tee again and, more particularly, to a golf ball conveying apparatus which prevents dimples of a golf ball from wearing during a process of conveying the golf ball and solves a problem in that a ball conveying pipe becomes clogged when a damaged golf ball enters the ball conveying pipe.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, as shown in FIG. 1, in an indoor driving range, golf balls, struck by golfers, are collected and supplied to a golf ball conveyor 1 provided on an upper portion of the indoor driving range. Thereafter, the golf balls are supplied to a plurality of tee areas through first ball conveying pipes 2. Golf balls, which have been supplied to each swing section, enter a temporary storage container 3 which has an air blower 3a and a golf ball storage box 3b. When no golf ball is in a tee-up device 4 embedded in the<br>
2<br><br>
ground after a golfer has struck the previous golf ball, the air blower 3a of the temporary storage container 3 operates. Thus, a golf ball, which has been in the golf ball storage box 3b, is rapidly supplied to the tee-up device 4 through a second ball conveying pipe 6 by the pressure of the air blower 3a. Thereafter, the golf ball is seated onto a rubber tee 5 which . is provided at a predetermined position on the tee-up device 4. As such, the golfer can repeatedly practice his/her golf swing.<br>
However, in such a golf ball conveying apparatus, because most indoor driving ranges are small, the first pipe and the temporary storage container may interfere with the swing of a golfer. This makes it difficult for the golfer to concentrate on his/her swing. Furthermore, if a damaged golf ball enters the second ball conveying pipe, the damaged golf ball become stuck due to friction between the inner surface of the second ball conveying pipe and a damaged portion of the golf ball. Thus, the second ball conveying pipe is clogged by the damaged golf ball. In particular, because the second ball conveying ' pipe is embedded in the ground, it is very difficult to remove the damaged golf ball from the second ball conveying pipe.<br>
Typically, a golf ball has dimples which are intended to increase the distance that the golf ball travels. However, in the conventional golf ball conveying apparatus, while a golf ball rapidly moves along the second ball conveying pipe, the<br>
3<br><br>
dimples of the golf ball wear rapidly due to contact between the golf ball and the inner surface of the second ball conveying pipe. Thus, the lifetime of the golf ball is reduced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a golf ball conveying apparatus which is reduced in size, thus providing a golfer; with plenty of room in a driving range, and which prevents dimples of a golf ball from wearing during a process of conveying the golf ball, and in which, even if a damaged golf ball enters a ball conveying pipe, the damaged golf ball is easily removed from the ball conveying pipe, thus solving a problem of the ball conveying pipe becoming clogged by a damaged golf ball.<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the present invention provides a golf ball conveying apparatus, including: a support bracket provided at a predetermined position in a housing of a tee-up device, with a through hole and a coupling hole formed at predetermined positions through the support bracket; a rotating pipe inserted at an end thereof into the through hole of the support bracket, with a spiral protrusion<br>
4<br><br>
provided on an inner surface of the rotating pipe, and a gear provided at a predetermined position on an outer surface of the rotating pipe; and a pipe support unit provided around each of opposite ends of the rotating pipe.  The pipe support unit has a pipe holding plate placed on a surface of the support bracket, with a bearing provided in the pipe holding plate, a plurality of spring seats provided at predetermined positions in the pipe holding plate,  and a plurality of springs seated in the spring seats, respectively, so that the bearing is supported by the plurality of springs seated in the spring seats and is in close contact at an inner surface thereof with the rotating pipe.  The pipe support unit further has a cover coupled to a surface of the pipe holding plate, with a coupling hole formed at a predetermined position through the cover, so that a locking bolt passes through both a coupling hole of the cover and a coupling hole of the pipe holding plate and is fastened into the coupling hole which is provided in the support bracket and has an internal thread, thus the pipe support unit supports the rotating pipe. The golf ball  conveying apparatus  further  includes  a motor provided at a predetermined position on the support bracket, with a gear provided on an output shaft of the motor and coupled to the gear of the rotating pipe by a chain, thus rotating the rotating pipe.<br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
6<br><br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a golf ball conveying apparatus, according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 is an exploded perspective view showing a pipe support unit 30 of the golf ball conveying apparatus of FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is a side view showing the assembled pipe support unit 30 of FIG. 3. FIG. 5 is a longitudinal sectional view showing a rotating pipe 26 of the golf ball conveying apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a tee-up device 100, which is embedded in the ground underneath a user, includes a golf ball setting device 20 which is provided at a predetermined position in the housing of the tee-up device 100, and a pipe driving unit 40 which is provided in the housing near the golf ball setting device 20. The golf ball setting device 20 has a sensor 14 to monitor whether a golf ball is on a tee 11 or not, and a rotating body 13 which is rotated by a first motor 12 that is provided at a predetermined position in the golf ball setting device 20, so that a golf ball 10 is seated on the tee 11 by the rotating body 13.<br>
The pipe driving unit 40 has a support bracket 21 which is attached at a predetermined position to the housing of the tee-up device 100. Two through holes 21b are formed at predetermined portions through the support bracket 21. Both a second motor 22 and a first gear 23, which is coupled to the second motor 22, are supported by the support bracket 21 using<br>
7<br><br>
one through hole 21b. The rotating pipe 26, which is integrally provided with a second gear 25 coupled to the first gear 23 by a chain 24, passes through the remaining through hole 21b of the support bracket 21. The pipe support unit 30 is placed on the surface of the support bracket 21 at a position corresponding to the rotating pipe 26.<br>
The pipe support unit 30 is provided on the support bracket 21 at a position corresponding to the rotating pipe 26. The pipe support unit 30 includes a pipe holding plate 31 which is placed on the support bracket 21. A bearing 32 is provided in the pipe holding plate 31. A plurality of spring seats 31a is provided around the bearing 32 in the pipe holding plate 31. A spring 33 is seated in each spring seat 31a, so that the bearing 32 is supported by the springs 33 seated, in the spring seats 31a and is in close contact at an inner surface thereof with the rotating pipe 26. The pipe support unit 30 further includes a cover 34 which is provided on the surface of the pipe holding plate 31, with a through hole 34a formed through the cover 34 to pass the rotating pipe 26 through the cover 34. A coupling hole 34b is formed at a predetermined position through the cover 34, so that a locking bolt passes through both the coupling hole 34b of the cover 34 and a coupling hole 31b of the pipe holding plate 31 and is fastened into the coupling hole 21a which is provided in the support bracket 21 and has an internal thread.  Thus, the pipe<br>
8<br><br>
support unit 30 supports the rotating pipe 26.<br>
Furthermore, a spiral protrusion 26a is provided on an inner surface of the rotating pipe 26. The second gear 25 is integrally provided at a predetermined position on an outer surface of the rotating pipe 26. The rotating pipe 26 passes through an outer pipe 27.<br>
The operation of the golf ball conveying apparatus of the present invention will be explained herein below.<br>
First, a golf ball, struck by a golfer, is conveyed to a golf ball conveyor provided on an upper portion of a driving range. Thereafter, the golf ball is supplied to a ball conveying pipe (not shown) which is installed in a support wall of the driving range.<br>
Subsequently, the golf ball moves to the ground through the ball conveying pipe. Thereafter, the golf ball is supplied into the rotating pipe 26 which is embedded in the ground. Here, because the rotating pipe 26 is inserted into the outer pipe 27 and the opposite ends of the rotating pipe 26 are supported by the pipe support units 30, even if the rotating pipe 26 is embedded in the ground, the rotation of the rotating pipe 26 is reliable.<br>
Furthermore, the pipe support unit 30 is placed on the surface of the support bracket 21, and the through hole 21b, which is greater in diameter than the outer diameter of the rotating pipe 26, is formed through the support bracket 21.<br>
9<br><br>
Thus, the rotating pipe 26 passes through the through hole 21b of the support bracket 21. Moreover, the rotating pipe 26 passes through the pipe holding plate 31 such that the outer surface of the rotating pipe 26 is in close contact with the inner surface of the bearing 32 which is provided in the pipe holding plate 31 and is supported by the plurality of springs 33. The cover 34 including the through hole 34a, through which the rotating pipe 26 passes, and which has the same diameter as the through hole 21b of the support bracket 21, is coupled to the pipe holding plate 31 by the locking bolt. Thus, the elasticity of the springs 33 prevents the bearing 32 from damage due to movement of the rotating pipe 26, so that the rotating pipe 26 can smoothly rotate.<br>
Meanwhile, the second gear 25 is integrally provided on the rotating pipe 26 at a predetermined position in the tee-up device 100. The first gear 23 of the second motor 22 is coupled to the second gear 25 by the chain 24. Therefore, when the second motor 22 is operated, the second gear 25 rotates along with the first gear 23. As a result, the rotating pipe 26 rotates.<br>
As such, when the rotating pipe 26 rotates, a golf ball, which is in the rotating pipe 26, rotates and moves along the spiral protrusion 26a, which is provided on the inner surface of the rotating pipe 2 6, and .the golf ball moves along the rotating pipe 26 to the tee-up device 100.  Here, even if the<br>
10<br><br>
rotating pipe transversely vibrates while rotating, because the bearing 32 is supported by the springs 33 of the pipe support unit 30, the bearing 32 is prevented from being damaged.<br>
When the second motor 22 reversely rotates, the golf ball in the rotating pipe 26 is discharged to the outside through the end of the rotating pipe 26 opposite the tee-up device 100. Therefore, the present invention can easily remove a damaged golf ball from the rotating pipe 26.<br>
Furthermore, the sensor 14 is provided in the golf ball setting device 20. Accordingly, because the sensor 14 monitors whether a golf ball is on the tee 11 or not, only when no golf ball is placed on the tee 11 is the second motor 22 operated.<br>
As described above, a golf ball conveying apparatus according to the present invention does not require a separate temporary storage container. Therefore, compared with conventional apparatuses, a golfer can use a larger space in an indoor driving range. Furthermore, the golf ball conveying apparatus of the present invention has a simple structure and the method of operating the apparatus is easy. Thus, even if the rotating pipe becomes clogged by a damaged golf ball, the present invention can easily remove the damaged golf ball. In addition, the present invention has markedly reduced manufacturing costs compared with conventional apparatuses.<br>
11<br><br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>
