				<td>PYRAZOLINE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR<br>
APPLICATION AS MEDICAMENTS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to new pyrazoline derivatives, of general<br>
10 formula (I), and to physiologically acceptable salts thereof, to the procedures for<br>
their preparation, to ther application as medicaments in human and/or veterinary<br>
therapy and to the pharmaceutical compositions that contain them.<br>
The new compounds object of the present invention can be used in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry as intermediates and for the preparation of medicaments.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are traditionally classified as<br>
anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic agents"for the symptomatic alleviation<br>
of inflammation, fever and light to moderate pain. The main indications for these<br>
drugs are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases of<br>
articulations, as well as for the treatment of inflammations associated with small<br>
lesions and as analgesics of broad use. The NSAIDS are essentially inhibitors of<br>
acute inflammatory response, but in rheumatic disorders they have little effect on<br>
the underlying degenerative changes occurring in tissue.<br>
The discovery of the main mechanism of action of the NSAIDS by inhibition<br>
of cyclooxygenase (COX) [J.R. Vane, Nature, 1971, 231, 232] provided a<br>
2<br>
Satisfactory explanation of their therapeutic action and established the importance<br>
that certain prostaglandins have as mediators in inflammatory disease [R.J.<br>
Flower, J.R. Vane, Biochem. Pharm., 1974, 23, 1439; J.R. Vane, R.M. Botting,<br>
Postgrad Med. J., 199c, S6 (Suppl 4), S2]. The gastric toxicity of the classic<br>
5 NSAIDS, as well as their beneficial effects, is due to the suppression of<br>
prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of the COX enzyme. Although several<br>
strategies have been followed (enteral coating to prevent adsorption in the<br>
stomach, parenteral administration, pro-drug formulation, etc) to reduce the<br>
gastrointestinal lesions provoked by the NSAIDS, none of these modifications<br>
10 have provided a significant impact on the incidence of serious adverse reactions<br>
such as perforation and haemorrhaging.<br>
The discovery of an induced prostaglandin-synthetase, denominated<br>
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), different from the constitutive enzyme, currently<br>
denominated cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)[J. Sirois, J.R. Richards, J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
15 1992, 267, 6382], has renewed the interest in the development of new anti-<br>
inflammatory drugs. The identification of the isoform COX-2 has led to the<br>
hypothesis that it could be responsible for the production of prostaglandins in<br>
places where inflammation occurs. As a result, selective inhibition of this<br>
isoenzyme would reduce the inflammation without producing the side effects of<br>
20 gastric and renal toxicity. The COX-1 isoenzyme is essentially expressed in most<br>
of tissues with the function of synthesising prostaglandins which regulate the<br>
normal cell activity. On the other hand, the isoenzyme COX-2 is not normally<br>
present in cells but in chronic inflammation the levels of the protein COX-2<br>
increase in parallel with the over-production of prostaglandins [J.R. Vane, R.M.<br>
25 Botting, Inflamm. Res., 1995, 44, 1]. Therefore, a selective COX-2 inhibitor has<br>
the same anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties as a<br>
conventional non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent and also inhibits the uterine<br>
contractions induced by hormones and presents potential anti-carcinogenic<br>
effects and beneficial effects in the prevention of the development of Alzheimer<br>
30 disease. On the other hand, a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduces the potential<br>
3<br>
gastrointestinal toxicity, reduces the potential renal side effects and reduces the<br>
effects of bleeding time.<br>
The tri-dimensional structure of COX-1 has been determined by x-ray<br>
diffraction [D. Picot, P.J. Loll, R.M. Garavito, Nature, 1994, 367, 243]. Three of the<br>
5 helixes of the structure form the entrance to the cyclooxygenase channel and its<br>
insertion in the membrane allows the arachidonic acid to access the active site<br>
from inside the bilayer. The active site of cyclooxygenase is a large hydrophobic<br>
channel and the authors argue that the NSAIDS inhibit COX-1 by excluding<br>
arachidonic acid from the upper part of the channel. Recently [R.S. Service,<br>
10 Science, 1996, 273, 1660], the three-dimensional structure of COX-2 has been<br>
described, which allows comparison of the similarities and differences between<br>
the two isoforms and therefore study of new drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2.<br>
The structures of COX-1 and COX-2 show that the sites where the anti-<br>
inflammatory agents bind to the enzymes are very similar but there is a difference<br>
15 of at least one important amino acid. A voluminous isoleucine present in the<br>
active site of COX-1 is replaced by a valine in COX-2. The isoleucine blocks the<br>
lateral cavity that is separated from the principle bond of both isoenzymes. The<br>
blocked cavity of COX-1 does not impede the binding of classic NSAIDS, but an<br>
inhibitor that needs the extra support point supplied by the lateral cavity will bind<br>
20 more easily to COX-2 than to COX-1. As a result, a model for a new generation of<br>
anti-inflammatory agents is one where the inhibitors of cyclooxygenase have a<br>
large preference for the lateral cavity of COX-2.<br>
In the chemical literature derivatives of nitrogenated heterocyclic aromatics<br>
of five members have been described with COX-2 inhibitory activity. Within these<br>
25 azole derivatives are the pyrrols [W.W. Wilkerson, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1994, 37,<br>
988; W.W. Wilkerson, et al, J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, 3895; I.K. Khanna, et al, J.<br>
Med. Chem., 1997, 40, 1619], pyrazoles [T.D. Penning, et al, J. Med. Chem.,<br>
1997, 40, 1347; K. Tsuji, et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1997, 45, 987; K. Tsuji, et al,<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1997, 45, 1475], or imidazoles [Khanna, et al, J. Med. Chem.,<br>
30 1997, 40, 1634].<br>
4<br>
We have now discovered that the novel compounds derived from<br>
pyrazolines of general formula (I) show interesting biological properties and these<br>
make them particularly useful for their employment in human and/or veterinary<br>
therapy. The compounds object of this invention are useful as agents with anti-<br>
5 inflammatory activity and for other diseases wherein cyclooxygenase-2 plays a<br>
part, without having the gastric and renal toxicity of the classic NSAIDS.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
10 The present invention provides new pyrazolines that inhibit the enzyme<br>
cyclooxygenase-2, with application in human and/or veterinary medicine as anti-<br>
inflammatories and for other diseases wherein cyclooxygenase-2 plays a part,<br>
and that have low or gastric and real toxicity.These anti-inflammatories<br>
therefore have a better safety profile. The new compounds object of the present<br>
15 invention are derivatives of A2-pyrazolines, also known as 4,5-dihydro-1H-<br>
pyrazoles, They are therefore non-aromatic nitrogenated heterocyclic compounds.<br>
As a result the pyrazoline rings are not planar as opposed to the azoles described<br>
previously. The compounds object of the present invention have the general<br>
formula (I)<br>

wherein<br>
Ri represents an hydrogen atom, a methyl, fluoromethyl,<br>
35 difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, carboxylic acid, lower carboxylate of 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, carboxamide or cyano group,<br>

metylsulfonyl or aminosulphonyl group; and<br>
20 R7 represents a hydrogen, chlorine or fluorine atom, a methyl,<br>
trifluoromethyl or methoxy group.<br>
The new compounds of general formula (I) have an asymmetric carbon atom<br>
and so can be prepared enantiomerically pure or as racemates. The racemates of<br>
compounds (I) can be resolved into their optical isomers by conventional<br>
25 methods, such as separation by chiral stationary phase chromatography for<br>
example, or by fractionated crystallisation of their diastereoisomeric salts, which<br>
can be prepared by reacting the compounds (I) with enantiomerically pure acids.<br>
Similarly, they can also be obtained by enantioselective synthesis using<br>
enantiomerically pure chiral precursors.<br>
30 The present invention also relates to the physiologically acceptable salts of<br>
the compounds of general formula (I), in particular, to the addition salts formed<br>
6<br>
with mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, nitric<br>
acid, etc, and with organic acids such as citric, maleic, fumaric acid, tartaric acids<br>
or its derivatives, p-toluenesulphonic, methanosulphonic, camphosulphonic acid<br>
etc.<br>
The novel derivatives of general formula (I) can be used in mammals,<br>
including man, as anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of inflammation and<br>
for the treatment of other disorders associated with inflammation, such as<br>
analgesics for the treatment of pain and migraine, and as anti-pyretics in the<br>
treatment of fever. For example, the new derivatives of general formula (I) can be<br>
used in the treatment of arthritis, including but limited to the treatment of<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, gouty arthritis, systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, osteoarthritis and juvenile arthritis. The novel derivatives of<br>
general formula (I) can be used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, menstrual<br>
disorders, tendinitis, bursitis and different states that affect the skin such as<br>
psoriasis, eczema, burns and dermatitis. The novel derivatives of general formula<br>
(I) can also be used in the treatment of gastrointestinal afflictions such as<br>
syndrome of inflamed intestine, Crohn"s disease, gastritis, irritated colon<br>
syndrome and ulcerous colitis.<br>

metylphenyl)-3-trifluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole<br><br>
Preparation of (E)-1,1,1-trifluoro-4-(4-methylphenyl)-3-butene-2-one (Method E-1)<br>
Into a flask with dry inert atmosphere, 15 ml of anhydrous THF is introduced<br>
and the flask cooled to -70° C. A solution of 2 M LDA in THF-hexane (5 ml, 10<br>
mmoles) and diethylmethyl phosphonate (0.75 ml, 5 mmoles) dissolved in 5 ml of<br>
THF are added and the flask shaken for 30 minutes. Then, N-<br>
phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl chloride (1.04 g , 5 mmoles) is added dropwise,<br>
(prepared according to Tamura, K.; Mizukami, H. et al.; J. Org. Chem., 1993, 58,<br>
32-35) while continuing the shaking in the same conditions for 1 hour. P-<br>
toluenaldehyde (0.6 g, 5 mmoles) is added, the cold bath removed and the flask<br>
left with shaking at room temperature for 16 hours. 10 ml of 2N HCI are added<br>
with shaking for a further 4 hours. The THF is eliminated with a rotavapor, the ,<br>
mixture extracted with ethyl ether (3x20 ml) and the combined organic extracts<br>
washed with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution and with saturated sodium chloride<br>
solution until reaching a pH ˜ 6. The mixture is dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulphate and evaporated. The crude oil obtained is purified using column<br>
chromatography through silica gel under pressure (eluting with AcOEt-petrol ether<br>

The products object of the invention are potent, orally active, anti-<br>
inflammatory agents, and selective inhibitors of COX-2, with a notable analgesic<br>
activity, lack ulceregenic effects and are very active in the experimental arthritis<br>
test. With a view to demonstrating these activities, by way of example, some<br>
pharmacological assays are now indicated.<br>
Inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins in inflammatory exudate and mucus<br>
membrane in rat.<br>
In this assay, as well as demonstrating the selective inhibition of COX-2, the<br>
anti-inflammatory activity is also demonstrated, along with the absence of effects<br>
on gastric prostaglandins, after oral administration. The assay was carried out by<br>
modification of a method described by O. Tofanetti et al. (Med. Sci. Res. 1989, 17,<br>
745-746). The products under study are administered orally at an initial screening<br>
dose of 40 mg/kg. One hour after treatment the rats were anaesthetised and a <br>
sponge soaked in carrageenan was implanted subcutaneously in the<br>
interscapular zone. Six hours after implantation the rats were sacrificed and the<br>
interscapular sponges extracted as well as gastric mucous. Next the PGE2 content<br>
was determined by immunoassay for each one of the samples, in the sponge <br>
exudate on the one hand and in the gastric mucus on the other. The inhibition of<br>
PGE2 in the inflammatory exudate demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity, both of<br>
COX-2 and COX-1 inhibitors, whereas inhibition of PGE2 in the gastric mucus is<br>
considered a COX-1 inhibitory effect.<br>
Table 3 summaries the results obtained with the compound of examples 3<br>
and in table 4 the ED-50 (effective dose-50) is shown, as well as its selectivity. It<br>
is a more potent anti-inflammatory that the reference product.<br>

Analgesic activity against "hvperalaesia" bv thermal stimulus of pre-inflamed rat<br>
paw.<br>
In this assay the analgesic activity in rat was monitored following the method<br>
described by K. Hargreaves et al. (Pain, 1988, 32, 77-78). Firstly, a suspension of<br>
carrageenan was injected into the back right paw of each rat. After two hours the<br>
products under study were administered orally at a screening dose of 40 mg/kg.<br>
Two hours after treatment a heat source was applied to the sole of each back paw<br>
of the rats and the time measured that they took to remove the paw measured.<br>
Hyperalgesia was determined by comparing the percentage of algesia of the paw<br>
injected with carrageenan to the other back paw. The analgesic activity was<br>
calculated comparing these hyperalgesia values of the groups treated with<br>
product with those of the group treated with the vehicle only.<br>
In table 5 the results obtained with the compound of example 3 and<br>
summarised and in table 6 the ED-50 is presented, showing that this product is<br>
more active that other selective inhibitors of COX-2 in the assay of activity against<br>
thermal hyperalgesia.<br>

Gastrointestinal effects (GO : induction of ulcers in rats submitted to cold stress.<br>
In this assay possible ulcerogenic effects at a gastrointestinal level were<br>
determined after oral administration. To do this a modification of the method<br>
described by K. D. Rainsford (Agents and actions, 1975, 5, 553-558) was<br>
followed. Firstly the rats received the products under study orally at different<br>
doses. After two hours had elapsed the rats were placed in a chest freezer at -15°<br>
C for 1 hour. Afterwards they were left for 1 hour at room temperature. The<br>
animals were then sacrificed and the stomach extracted. The stomach was kept in<br>
saline solution for 15 minutes. After this time the percentage of surface area with<br>
gastric ulcers was determined using a Project C.S.V. vs 1.2 image analyser for<br>
each stomach. For each product the maximum dose that did not lead to<br>
ulcerogenesis was determined by linear regression analysis of the dose-<br>
response.<br>
The results obtained with the compound of example 3 are summarised in<br>
table 7. It has been shown not to have ulcerogenic effects, even at very high<br>
doses, as was to be expected from a COX-2 selective product. On the other hand,<br>
dichlophenac and piroxicam, both selective COX-1 inhibitors, exhibited<br>
ulcerogenic effects at very low doses.<br>

Anti-arthritic activity in rat<br>
In this study the anti-arthritic activity in rat of the compound of example 3 has<br>
been studied. To do so the method described by B. J. Jaffee et al. (Agents and<br>
Actions, 1989, 27, 344-346) was followed. Firstly, the Freund adjuvant was<br>
injected (Mycobacterium butiricum suspended in soy-bean oil) through the sub-<br>
sole of the back left paw of the rats. After 14 days, when the secondary<br>
inflammation had developed in the uninjected paw, which is considered the<br>
experimental arthritis, treatment with the product under study or with the vehicle<br>
for the control group was started. The compound of example 3 was administered<br>
orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 11 days. The volume of the paw with<br>
secondary inflammation in the last days of treatment was measured. The anti-<br>
arthritic activity was calculated by comparing the average volume of the paw with<br>
secondary inflammation of the group treated with the compound of example 3 and<br>
the control group for 5 days.<br>
The results obtained show that the compound of example 3 has a high anti-<br>
arthritic activity, as treatment with 10 mg/kg/day, po, led to an inhibition of<br>
secondary inflammation, i.e. of an anti-arthritic activity, of 71%.<br>
On the basis of their good pharmacodynamic properties, the derivatives of<br>
pyrazolines in accordance with the invention, can be used in satisfactory manner<br>
in human and animal therapy, in particular as anti-inflammatory agents for the<br>
treatment of inflammation and for the treatment of other disorders associated with<br>
inflammation, such as anti-arthritics, analgesics for the treatment of pain and<br>
migraine, or as antipyretics in the treatment of fever.<br>
In human therapy, the administration dose of the compounds of the present<br>
invention varies as a function of the seriousness of the affliction to treat. Normally<br>
the dose will lie between 100 and 400 mg/day. The compounds of the invention<br>
will be administered, for example, in the form of capsules, tablets, or injectable<br>
solutions or suspensions.<br>
