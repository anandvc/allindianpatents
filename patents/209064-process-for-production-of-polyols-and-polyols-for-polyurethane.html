LTD. of KILL FIREHOUSE, 1ST FLOOR, C-17, DALIA INDUSTRIAL AREA OFF LINK ROAD, ANDHERI (WEST) MUMBAI 400 053, INDIA AN INDIAN COMPANY, and SHAHASHVIN PUTLAMENSION,DARABSHA, ROAD, MUMBAI 400026, INDIA. A CITIZEN OF INDIA and   SHAHTILAK 104 LOCHBERRY LANE, CARY, NC 27511, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.. A CITIZEN OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF POLYOL USABLE IN THE PRODUCTION OF POLYURETHANE FOAM<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for production of polyols for use in production of polyurethane foam systems. The invention also relates to the polyols, for example, polyester, produced by the process which are useful in the production of polyurethane foam. More specifically, the invention relates to the use of renewable agricultural resources such as vegetable oil, and more particularly castor oil, for the manufacture of polyester useful in production of foam polyurethane.<br>
Most of the polyols (polyester/polyether) used for manufacture of polyurethane foams systems are based on petroleum feed stock. More specifically, current processes for preparation of polyols for foamed polyurethane involves propoxylation, ethoxylation and estrification of multifunctional hydroxyl (OH) precursors until a required hydroxyl (OH) value is achieved. The desired product is then purified to remove catalyst therefrom, as well as other undesirable components. Thus, as may be appreciated, polyols, in particular polyester and/or polyether are important reactants for the manufacturer of commercially useful polyurethane foams.<br>
While presenting a useful source for the manufacture of such polyols, petroleum feed stock is generally considered nonrenewable and a source of feed stock which will eventually be depleted. Thus, in accordance with the invention, it becomes desirable to minimize the use of a nonrenewable feed stock such as petroleum- Further, current environmental considerations place great importance on the use of "green technologies", in particular, with respect to the use of such technologies for the manufacture of polyols useful in producing polyurethane foam. Thus, in accordance with the invention, the problems of using a nonrenewable feed stock such as a petroleum feed stock is avoided, by providing a method of manufacturing commercially useful polyols from renewable feed stock.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the production of polyol'for use in production of polyurethane foam. The process involves<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.338816/79232 Express  Mail Lable No: L923250641 US reacting under agitation a mixture of a predetermined quantity of agricultural feed stock in a<br>
ratio of about 100 parts, with ai multifunctional hydroxyl component in a ratio of about 10 to<br>
about 200 parts. At least one di basic acid, or a mixture of di basic acids, such as adipic and<br>
phfhalic acid, or a diol, DEG, and PEG may also be added and reacted in the mixture in a<br>
ratio of up to about 100 parts. The reaction is conducted in the presence of a free radical<br>
catalyst suitable for estrification and polymerization, typically an alkali/alkaline earth/tin<br>
based catalyst, in an amount of about 0.01 percent to about 2 percent by weight of the<br>
mixture. The reaction is conducted at a temperature and for a time effective to result in a<br>
polyol useful for producing polyurethane foam.<br>
In a more specific aspect, the feed stock, is vegetable oil; or a mixture of vegetable oils, and more particularly castor oil. Castor oil is a nondrying oil extracted from the castor bean, which after processing, has previously been used as a lubricant among other applications. It is also known as ricinus oil. The reaction is preferably conducted at a temperature of about 150°C to about 250°C. Yet more preferably, the reaction is conducted for a time period of about 6 hours to about S hours to result in different polyester polyols of 2 to 5 (hydroxyl) functionality. In conducting the reaction, preferably the hydroxyl component is a multifunctional hydroxyl component such as glycerin and sorbitol.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to a polyol for use in the production of polyurethane foam which is the product of the previously described reaction. More specifically, the polyol results from the reaction in which the feed stock is castor oil with the polyol resulting from having blended the reaction product with stabilizer catalyst and blowing agents to result in a polyol suitable for production of a predetermined polyurediane foam.<br>
Having thus briefly described the invention, the same will become better understood from the following detailed discussion.<br>
Detailed Discussion of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention there is provided a process for manufacture of polyols which are useful for manufacturing polyurethane foam. Specifically, the process results in polyester polyols which are prepared from vegetable oils such as castor oil, or other ingredients mostly derived from agricultural sources.<br>
The other vegetable oils considered are unsaturated oils like Soybean oil. Multifunctional hydroxyl components used as one of the reaction input are the substances like<br><br>
glycerin and sorbitol. A significant source of glycerin is from saponification vegetable oils like Palm oil, whereas Sorbitol is produced using sucrose as the starring material. Sucrose is fully derived from agricultural sources with multifunctional hydroxyl components to produce a polyester polyol of about 2 to about 5 (hydroxy!) functionality useful for the manufacturer of polyurethane foam. For purposes of this disclosure, it is noted that OH refers to the hydroxyl number of the polyol. The functionality refers to the average number of hydroxyl groups per molecule of polyol and m.w. refers to the molecular weight of the polyol.<br>
The polymer/polyols in accordance with the invention are produced by estrification/trans estrification of a polymerization known quantity of vegetable oil such as castor oil in a mixture with at least one multifunctional hydroxyl component, i.e., OH greater than 1, or a mixture thereof, and di basic acid. The previously mentioned materials are reacted under agitation at a temperature range of about 150°C to about_25,01C in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a conventional free radical catalyst known to be suitable for the polymerization of the unsaturated monomers in the oil. Specifically, such a catalyst can be an alkali/alkaline earth/tin based catalyst in an amount of anywhere from 0.01 to about<br>
 2 percent by weight. The reaction is conducted typically for a period of about 2 to about 8 hours to result in a polyol which can then be purified and standardized. More specifically, depending on the specific ratios, temperatures and time of reaction, different polyols of functionality of about 2 to about 5 (hydroxyl) value can be produced.<br>
In a second step, depending on the desired polyurethane foam system to be prepared from the polyols, the polyols can be blended with appropriate ingredients such as a stabilizer catalyst, blowing agents, etc., to produce formulated polyols useful for achieving a desired performance of the polyurethane foam system to be produced. More specifically, the resultant polyols from the process of invention are typically polyesters which are used to produce foam polyurethane systems.<br>
The invention also relates to the polyols produced with accordance with the process described herein.<br>
Examples I-VII<br>
A series of polymer/polyols were prepared in batch processes. Examples I-VII below describe the different types of polyols which result from conducting the process with varying<br><br><br>
constituents of the mixtures, and under varying temperature and time conditions to result in different polyols", i.e. polyesters.<br>
