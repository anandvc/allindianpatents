TERMINAL MODULE ASSEMBLY FOR MOLDED CASE CIRCUIT BREAKER AND MOLDED CASE CIRCUIT BREAKER HAVING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a molded case circuit breaker, and particularly, to a terminal module assembly for a molded case circuit breaker in which a terminal part of the molded case circuit breaker is constructed as a module assembly to allow a fast replacement of a terminal module, so that a type of terminal (e.g., a standard type, a plug-in type or a box type) can be fast changed.<br>
2.	Background of the Invention<br>
In general, a molded case circuit breaker is an electrical device for protecting circuit and electrical loads by automatically breaking the electrical circuit upon occurring a fault current, such as over-current, ground fault current or short-circuit current, on the electrical crcuit,<br>
A molded case circuit breaker generally comprises a terminal part which connects a power source or an electrical load of the circuit, a switching mechanism which switches the circuit by contacting a fixed contact with a movable contact or separate them from each other within the molded case; circuit breaker, and a trip mechanism which senses a fault current to trip the switching mechanism to a circuit-broken position.<br>
The terminal part, for example, comprises an outer protrusion of the fixed<br>
2<br><br>
contact and a terminal. The types of the terminal may include a box type terminal which is mostly used when wires at the power source side circuit and the load side circuit have "ring-shaped" terminals or "U-shaped" terminals, a plug-in type terminal which is used when the molded case circuit breaker is connected to the circuit by inserting the terminal into a terminal insertion hole on a plug-in base, , and a standard type terminal as a typical bar-shaped terminal which is commonly used when wires in the circuit have a circular section.<br>
Manufacturers of molded case circuit breakers manufacture the related art terminals monolithically with the molded case circuit breaker, without separately providing only the terminals. Accordingly, when the type of terminal should be changed according to an installation environment of the molded case circuit breaker, a user should purchase the whole molded case circuit breaker having the same type of terminal that he wants to get, in order to replace only the terminal.<br>
To solve the inconvenience, the applicant of this invention has proposed a module-type terminal structure such as "module-type terminal structure of molded case circuit breaker" (Korean Patent Laid Open No. 2006-0087344, open date: August 2nd, 2006).<br>
By adapting the module-type terminal structure of the molded case circuit breaker proposed by the applicant of this application, the user does not have to purchase the whole molded case circuit breaker in order to replace only the type of terminal he desires to get. However, in case of a typical 3-phases Alternating Current molded case circuit breaker, when assembling each of 6 terminal modules (i.e., 3 terminal modules respectively at the load side and the power source side) to the molded case circuit breaker using screws, it takes long time and it is inconvenient for both of manufacturer and user.<br>
2A<br><br>
Furthermore, the terminal module itself is a merely small component about several tens millimeters. Accordingly, it is difficult to separately fabricate, package and sell the terminal module. Also, the user may be in trouble for assembling the small component to the molded case circuit breaker.<br>
In addition, the molded case circuit breaker may be restricted only to molded case circuit breakers which have, for example, a rail-mounted connection structure such that the replaceable terminal module can be connected thereto.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, in order to solve the drawbacks of the related art, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a terminal module assembly of a molded case circuit breaker capable of allowing manufacturers to fabricate, package and sell a terminal module and also allowing users to easily replace only the terminal module with his desired type, by constructing the terminal module as a 3-phases monolithic assembly for a power source side or a load side of the molded case circuit breaker.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a molded case circuit breaker having the terminal module assembly.<br>
Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a terminal module assembly of a molded case circuit breaker capable of being constructed according to an installation environment of the molded case circuit breaker by assembling terminal modules into the terminal module assembly according to each phase or a power source or load side circuit in various combinations, and a molded case circuit breaker having the terminal module assembly.<br>
3<br><br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided a terminal module assembly for a molded case circuit breaker connected to fixed contactors of the molded case circuit breaker comprising: a plurality of terminals which are provided as many as the number of the fixed contactors provided each phase, and electrically connected to the fixed contactors, wherein each of the plurality of terminals selectively has a standard type, a plug-in type and a box type; a plurality of terminal base which are provided as many as the number of the terminals for fixedly supporting each of the terminals, and provided to selectively have the standard type, the plug-in type and the box type corresponding to the types of the terminals selected from the standard type, the plug-in type and the box type, wherein each terminal and the each terminal base are assembled to each other to obtain a terminal module intermediate assembly; and one common supporting base which supports all the intermediate assemblies regardless of the type of the terminal or terminal base, wherein the intermediate assemblies are assembled to the common supporting base to obtain a complete terminal module assembly, such that the standard, plug-in or box type terminal module assembly is selectively able to be mounted in the molded case circuit breaker or separated from the molded case circuit breaker without opening the case of the molded case circuit breaker.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided A molded case circuit breaker having a terminal module assembly comprising: a plurality of fixed contactors which are provided according to each phase and have end portions protruded to the outside of the molded case circuit breaker so as to be connected to a power source or load side wires; and a terminal module assembly<br>
4<br><br>
which is electrically connected to the end portions of the fixed contactors and selectively has a standard type, a plug-in type or a box type to be mounted in the molded case circuit breaker or separated therefrom, wherein the terminal module assembly comprises: a plurality of terminals which are provided to selectively have the standard type, the plug-in type and the box type corresponding to the types of the plurality of fixed contactors, and electrically connected to the end portions of the fixed contactors; a plurality of terminal bases which are provided as many as the number of the terminals for fixedly supporting each of the terminals, and provided to selectively have the standard type, the plug-in type and the box type corresponding to the types of the terminals selected from the standard type, the plug-in type and the box type, wherein each terminal and the each terminal base are assembled to each other to obtain a terminal module intermediate assembly; and one common supporting base which supports all the intermediate assemblies regardless of the type of the terminal or terminal base, wherein the intermediate assemblies are assembled to the common supporting base to obtain a complete terminal module assembly, such that the standard, plug-in or box type terminal module assembly is selectively able to be mounted in the molded case circuit breaker or separated from the molded case circuit breaker without opening the case of the molded case circuit breaker.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Description will now be given in detail of the present invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates that a terminal module assembly for a molded case circuit breaker is selectively installable to the molded case circuit breaker. As illustrated in FIG. 1, end portions 1a to 1d of 3-phase (i.e., R, S and T) of fixed contactors of a molded case circuit breaker 1 are protruded to the outside of the molded case circuit breaker 1.<br>
Assuming that the end portions 1a to 1c of the fixed contactors of the three end portions in FIG. 1 are end portions for connecting power source side wires, FIG. 1 shows only the end portion 1d for connecting a load side wire.<br>
It can be seen in FIG. 1 that a standard type terminal module assembly 10, a plug-in type terminal module assembly 20 and a box type terminal module<br>
8<br><br>
assembly 30, in each of which three phases are monolithically assembled, can respectively simply be mounted at the three end portions 1a to 1c of the power source side fixed contactors of the molded case circuit breaker 1 and three end portions (i.e., 1d and two other end portions not shown) of the load side fixed contactors.<br>
FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a construction and assembly of a standard type terminal module assembly according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, the construction and an assembling operations of the standard type terminal module assembly will be described hereinafter.<br>
The standard type terminal module assembly according to the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 2, may generally include a standard type terminal 2, a standard type terminal base 3 anc a common supporting base 4.<br>
The standard type terminal 2 as an electrical conductor is formed to be flat and almost T-shaped, and assembled to the standard type terminal base 3.<br>
At both side portions of the standard type terminal 2 are provided sliding insertion protrusions (numeral is not designated) which are formed to be stepped so as to be slidingly inserted into the standard type terminal base 3.<br>
The standard type termnal base 3 may include a body portion 3a, a bottom plate 3b horizontally extended outwardly from the bottom of the body portion 3a in all directions, a top plate 3c horizontally extended outwardly from the top of the body portion 3a in all directions, and guide protrusions 3d upwardly extended from both side surfaces of the top plate 3c, and forming a guide groove together with the top plate 3c, so as to guide and support the standard type terminal 2, the guide groove in which the sliding insertion protrusions provided at both the side portions of the standard type terminal 2 are inserted.<br>
9<br><br>
Slide grooves 3e, which allows the standard type terminal base 3 to be mounted at the common supporting base 4, are formed at both sides of the standard type terminal base 3 by ooth side surfaces of the body portion 3a and the bottom and top plates 3b and 3c each extended outwardly from the body portion 3a.<br>
The guide groove formed by the guide protrusion 3d and the upper surface of the top plate 3c may have a height higher than the thickness of the standard type terminal 2 by a predetermined tolerance.<br>
Contact-intensifying protrusions 3f are provided at central portions on upper surfaces of both sides of the bottom plate 3b in a length direction of the bottom plate 3b. Accordingly, when the standard type terminal base 3 is assembled to the common supporting base 4, the contact force can be intensified such that the standard type terminal base 3 can firmly be assembled to the common supporting base 4.<br>
The common supporting base 4 comprises outer walls 4a and 4d, and inner walls 4b and 4c provided between the outer walls 4a and 4d so as to form terminal installation spaces for each R. S or T phase together with the outer walls 4a and 4d.<br>
A pair of rails 4e inserted into the slide grooves 3e of the standard type terminal base 3 are provided respectively between the outer wall 4a and the inner wall 4b, between the outer wall 4d and the inner wall 4c and between the inner walls 4b and 4c of the common base 4.<br>
The upper surface of the rail 4e may function as a supporter on which the upper plate 3c of the standard type terminal base 3 is supported (placed).<br>
The rails 4e of the common supporting base 4 can be inserted into the<br>
10<br><br>
slide grooves 3e of the standard type terminal base 3 because the slide groove 3e of the standard type terminal base 3 is configured to have a height slightly higher than the height of the rail 4e by a predetermined tolerance.<br>
At a position spaced apart from an upper surface of the rail 4e by a predetermined distance on each inner surface of the outer walls 4a and 4d and the inner walls 4b and 4c, a stopper 4f is disposed to determine an insertion limit of the standard type terminal base 3 when assembling the standard type terminal base 3 to the common supporting base 4.<br>
The predetermined distance between the upper surface of the rail 4e and the stopper 4f is determined to be greater by a predetermined tolerance than the sum of the thickness of the upper plate 3c of the standard type terminal base 3 and the thickness of the standard type terminal 2.<br>
The reference numeral 4g on each of the inner walls 4b and 4c of the common supporting base 4 designates a screw insertion hole in which a screw S for assembling a terminal module assembly is inserted so as to assemble the standard terminal module assembly 10 to a molded case circuit breaker, in particular, a terminal part insulating partition wall (corresponding to a portion of the partition protruded forwardly above the end portions 1a to 1c of the fixed contactors in FIG. 1).<br>
The assembling method of the standard type terminal module assembly according to the present invention having such construction will be described as follows.<br>
First, the insertion protrusions of the standard type terminal 2 are slidably inserted into the guide groove formed by the guide protrusions 3d and the upper surface of the upper plate 3c, thereby assembling the standard type terminal 2 to<br>
11<br><br>
the standard type terminal base 3.<br>
By the assembly process, standard type terminal module intermediate assemblies 10a and 10b are made.<br>
The standard type terminal module intermediate assembly 10a or 10b is assembled for each phase. The assembled standard type terminal module intermediate assemblies 10a and 10b are inserted between the outer wall 4a and the inner wall 4b of the common supporting base 4, between the outer wall 4d and the inner wall 4c and between the inner walls 4b and 4c of the common supporting base 4, such that the rails 4e can be inserted into the slide grooves 3e of the standard type terminal base 3, thereby obtaining the standard type terminal module assembly 10 as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective view illustrating an assembled state of the standard type terminal module assembly according to the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 3, each phase standard type terminal module intermediate assembly is inserted between the outer wall 4a and the inner wall 4b of the common supporting base 4, between the outer wall 4d and the inner wall 4c and between the inner walls 4b and 4c.<br>
In FIG. 3, the numeral 10a is given to only one of the standard type terminal module intermediate assemblies according to each phase.<br>
It can be seen in FIG. 3 that the stoppers 4f restrict the insertion of the standard type terminal module ntermediate assemblies, and the standard type terminal 2 is mounted below the stoppers 4f. Also, it can be seen in FIG. 3 that the body portion 3a is inserted between a pair of rails 4e.<br>
The unexplained reference numeral 4g in FIG. 3 designates the screw insertion hole for fixing the standard type terminal module assembly 10 to the<br>
12<br><br>
molded case circuit breaker, which horizontally penetrates through each of the inner walls 4b and 4c.<br>
FIG. 4 is a view illustrating a method for assembling the standard type terminal module assembly to a molded case circuit breaker according to the present invention.<br>
Two standard type terminal module assemblies 10 are inserted upwardly (i.e., in a direction indicated by arrows) into the lower portion of the molded case circuit breaker 1 such that inner walls and outer walls of each of the standard type terminal module assemblies 1C can come in contact with the terminal part insulating partition walls of the molded case circuit breaker 1 (i.e., the walls extended downwardly from a terminal cover C in FIG. 4).<br>
1 screw S or 2 screws S for assembling a terminal module assembly, for example, per each standard type terminal module assembly 10 in FIG. 4, are tightened by a screw driver such that the screws can be inserted into screw insertion holes of the molded case circuit breaker 1 via the screw insertion holes of FIGs. 2 and 3, thereby completely assembling the standard type terminal module assemblies 10 to the molded case circuit oreaker 1.<br>
The standard type terminal module assembly 10 can be separated from the molded case circuit breaker 1 in reverse order of the assembly.<br>
Upon completing the assembly process, the end portions 1a to 1d of the power source side fixed contactors and the load side fixed contactors of the molded case circuit breaker 1 can electrically and mechanically be in contact with the standard type terminal 2 of the standard type terminal module assembly 10.<br>
Description will be given of a method for connecting wires of a power source side or load side circuit after completely assembling the standard type<br>
13<br><br>
terminal module assembly 10 according to the present invention to the molded case circuit breaker 1 as follows.<br>
That is, an end portion of a wire is placed on each end portion 1a to 1d of the fixed contactors. A screw driver is inserted into a screw driver insertion hole C1 of the terminal cover C to tighten a screw (not shown). Accordingly, the wire of the power source side or load side circuit is interposed between the head portion of the screw and each end portion 1a to 1d of the fixed contactors, thus to be connected.<br>
The wire may be separated in reverse order of the connection.<br>
FIG. 5 is a perspective viaw illustrating one embodiment of a molded case circuit breaker according to the present invention in a state that a standard terminal module assembly is connected to the molded case circuit breaker. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the standard type terminal module assembly 10 is in a state of being completely assembled to the molded case circuit breaker1 This state may designates a state that the wire of the power source side or load side circuit can be connected.<br>
FIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a construction and assembly of a plug-in type terminal module assembly according to the present invention. The construction and the assembly of the plug-in type terminal module assembly according to the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 6 as follows.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 6, the plug-in type terminal module assembly according to the present invention may include a plug-in type terminal 21, a plug-in type terminal base 22 and a common supporting base 4.<br>
The plug-in type terminal 21 may include a plug portion 21a implemented<br>
14<br><br>
as a pin-shaped electrical conducto; and a base connection portion 21b extended from the plug portion 21a. The plug-in type terminal 21 is assembled to the plug-in type terminal base 22.<br>
A jaw portion (reference numeral not designated) is provided between the plug portion 21a and the base connection portion 21b so as to determine an insertion length of the base connection portion 21b when inserting the base connection portion 21b into the plug-in type terminal base 22.<br>
The base connection portion 21b of the plug-in type terminal 21 is preferably formed in an octagonal or hexagonal pillar shape.<br>
The base connection portion 21b is forcibly inserted into its corresponding hole, which is formed through the plug-in type terminal base 22 in a plug portion connecting extended portion 22f<br>
Accordingly, the base connection portion 21b of the plug-in type terminal 21 is assembled to the plug-in type terminal base 22, thereby obtaining plug-in type terminal module intermediate assemblies 20a and 20b.<br>
The plug-in type terminal base 22 comprises a body portion 22a, a bottom plate 22b horizontally extended outwardly from the bottom of the body portion 22a in all directions, a top plate 22c horizontally extended outwardly from the top of the body portion 22a in all directions.<br>
Slide grooves 22d, which allows the plug-in type terminal base 22 to be mounted at the common supporting base 4, are formed at both sides of the plug-in type terminal base 22 by both side surfaces of the body portion 22a and the bottom and top plates 22b and 22c each extended outwardly from the body portion 22a.<br>
Contact-intensifying protrusions 22e are provided at central portions on<br>
15<br><br>
upper surfaces of both sides of the bottom plate 22b in a length direction of the bottom plate 22b. Accordingly, when the plug-in type terminal base 22 is assembled to the common supporting base 4, the contact force can be intensified such that the plug-in type terminal base 22 can firmly be assembled to the common supporting base 4.<br>
The common supporting base 4 may include outer walls 4a and 4d, and inner walls 4b and 4c provided between the outer walls 4a and 4d so as to form terminal installation spaces for each R. S or T phase together with the outer walls 4a and 4d.<br>
A pair of rails 4e inserted into the slide grooves 22d of the plug-in type terminal base 22 are provided respectively between the outer wall 4a and the inner wall 4b, between the outer wall 4d and the inner wall 4c and between the inner walls 4b and 4c.<br>
The upper surface of the rail 4e may function as a supporter on which the upper plate 22c of the plug-in type terminal base 22 is supported (placed).<br>
