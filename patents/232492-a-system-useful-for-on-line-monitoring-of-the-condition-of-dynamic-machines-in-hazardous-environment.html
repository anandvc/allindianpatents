				<td>The present  invention relates  to  a.<br>
useful for on-line Monitoring of the  Condition of dynamic machines in hazardous environment.<br>
The device of the present invention is a computerised package for continuous health condition monitoring of machines, which are widely distributed in a complex large integrated industry even in hazardous areas such as underground mines. The device of the present invention is specially designed for highly inflammable areas, like gassy coal mines, oil refinery, fertiliser, oil extraction, hydrogen plants etc. falling in category of group I, IIA, IIB and IIC of BIS-5780 and IS-2148.<br>
It contains both flameproof and intrinsically safe constituents.<br>
The health condition of machine is assessed on the basis of following measurements:<br>
1.	Bearing temperature;<br>
2.	RPM of machine;<br>
3.	Current consumption of machine;<br>
4.	Shock pulse assessment for bearings;<br>
5.	Vibration of machines.<br>
In the present day of industrialisation both production and safety are given top priority.<br><br>
Each dynamic equipment is required to work at its optimum value. This can only be achieved, if the machine has no down time, except during maintenance. If we like to have healthy machine, we shall have to keep watch on it continuously and not checking on routine basis. If we go through statistics on production loss or safety loss, we find that high down time is the root cause, resulting from improper maintenance and recklessness towards health condition of machine.<br>
Presently, throughout the world, great care are being taken on assessing health condition of machine routinely. A number of both hand held as well as continuously operating instruments have been developed to measure temperature, vibration, shock pulse from bearing, rpm, current, etc. of machine.<br>
Vibration measurement is predominant method for prediction maintenance of dynamic machines, this measurement is utilised in diagonsing possible machine faults, vibration characteristics of a machine are directly related to its condition.<br>
The measured vibration signal on an operating machine is complicated in nature, it contains a large amount of information about machine. In the previous technique it is forced to reduce the amount of<br><br>
information contained in measured vibrational signal to a single number, representing the over all value of signal. However, peak value and rms values are most commonly used for condition assessment.<br>
Accelerometers, vibration meters, portable data loggers are generally being employed for vibration measurement and its evaluation. The three basic quantities that are measured by instruments are acceleration, velocity and displacement.<br>
But in the present invention continuous measurements round the clock are done and analysis are processed on the basis of past and presents status of vibration signal.<br>
In certain cases condition of machine is assessed on the basis of bearing temperature measurement using analog display, with thermocouple sensors like Cr-Al, Fe-constantan Pt-Pt/Rh. This type of temperature measurements for one or two bearing and its subsequent display does not help much in diagnosing machine condition. In order to get total picture of bearings employed in the machine, efforts has been made in the present development to put one no of highly rugged RTD sensor with each bearing of the machine and temperature measurement is logged round the clock, for better<br><br>
assessment of machine condition.<br>
Similar method using current  trasformer as a<br>
sensor is employed for display of current consumption of the machine or some time portable tongstester is also employed for the purpose, but none are available for hazardous industries for continuous measurement.<br>
Various types of hand held instruments like Tachometer, Shock Pulse meter have also been employed for machine condition diagnosis. But no attempt has been made to integrate essential parameters of a machine to a central processor based system, to give clear picture on machine condition and its developing problem, which may annunciate alarm in case of any likely machine failure.<br>
To the best of our knowledge the hitherto known device are not only stand alone device but are not suitable for use in hazardous areas. Hence, there is a definite need for the development of a complete package which may operate continuously in hazardous area.<br>
All the available instruments are of discrete type and are mostly based on one or two parameters. Such portable instrument(a) cannot diagnose all the problems, simultaneously, developing in the machine. Besides this hitherto known instrument(s) also do not give past history or trends of developing<br><br>
problem, rather gives some sort of indication on fault on the basis of spot measurements.<br>
In most of the cases it has been found, that fault develops gradually and to diagnose the problem trending is must which is generally not available with the known instruments in most of the cases. These type of instruments do not stand reliably for long due, to extreme bad industrial condition. Besides these, available instruments are of general type and is not intrinsically safe and hence can not be used in hazardous industries, available instruments are also not rugged enough to face industrial environment.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for on-line monitoring of the condition of dynamic machines in hazardous environment.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device which is capable of integrating multiple parameters which enables help dynamic diagnosise of the health condition of machines.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide complete diagnosis of developing problem(s), analysis based on machine parameters like vibration, RPM, current, bearing temperature and shock pulse<br><br>
measurements in the form of complete trendings, past records in engineering values, graph, trends, histograms etc, based on menu driven software.<br>
Still another object is to provide a device which is intrinsically safe and rugged enough to stand against shock, dust, humidity and vibration and capable of 24 hrs. surveillance on the working machines and annunciates audio-visual alarm much a head of failure of machines to occur.<br>

It is connected to multiplexer board (64 channel) having single channel ADC. It may be connected to any type of sensor, which needs either +15V DC or ±15V DC supply, having signal output of 4-20mA.<br>
There is a switching system in Mux board, where single power source of +15V or ±15V DC can be switched sequentially (one by one) to all 64 channels (or sensors). The power supply switching to a particular<br><br>
