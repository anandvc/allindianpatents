				<td>GLASS SUBSTRATE PROVIDED WITH RAISED GLASS ELEMENTS<br>
The invention relates to a glass substrate provided<br>
with raised glass elements placed over part of its<br>
area.<br>
Although not limited to such an application, the<br>
invention will be more particularly described in the<br>
case of glass substrates with reference to the<br>
production of a flat emissive screen, and more<br>
precisely a plasma screen. Other uses, such as for FED<br>
screens or plane lamps, may also be envisioned. The<br>
expression "plane lamp" should be understood as<br>
encompassing lamps intended for the manufacture of<br>
portable computers and lamps of larger dimensions for<br>
architectural applications, such as for the production<br>
of advertising panels or of partitions, for example in<br>
offices, whatever the technology of these lamps.<br>
A plasma screen is essentially composed of two plane<br>
glass substrates. Deposited on at least one of the<br>
substrates are one or more electrode arrays, a layer of<br>
a dielectric material and layers consisting of<br>
phosphors corresponding, for example, to the colors<br>
green, red and blue. Before being joined together, the<br>
glass substrates also receive barriers, the functions<br>
of which are to form a multitude of cells, which<br>
isolate the phosphors from one another, and to keep the<br>
two glass substrates a certain distance apart.<br>
The barriers, also called ribs, are produced<br>
independently of the glass substrates and attached to<br>
the substrate. The ribs are obtained by depositing a<br>
glass frit joined to one of the substrates by a process<br>
which has, however, slow steps, such as sandblasting<br>
and screen printing, and complex and expensive steps<br>
requiring, in particular, the recycling of the dust<br>
generated during the sandblasting step, which is not<br>
without creating a few pollution problems.<br><br>
Moreover, it has been noticed that the phosphors suffer<br>
functional degradation due to the deposition on the<br>
ribs of impurities generated during the process for<br>
obtaining the ribs.<br>
Furthermore, to ensure proper operation as regards the<br>
ignition voltages of the electrodes, it is necessary to<br>
cover the electrodes with a dielectric, the deposition<br>
of which constitutes an additional step, which goes<br>
counter to the ever desired aim of improving the<br>
production costs.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to propose a<br>
glass substrate provided with raised glass elements so<br>
as especially to constitute ribs which do not have the<br>
drawbacks of the prior art and allow cost savings to be<br>
made in the manufacture of products using such a<br>
substrate.<br>
According to the invention, the glass substrate<br>
comprising raised glass elements over part of its area<br>
is characterized in that said glass elements are<br>
intrinsically incorporated into the substrate.<br>
Preferably, the body of the substrate has two opposed<br>
parallel faces, the elements being incorporated into at<br>
least one of the two faces.<br>
According to one feature, the glass elements lie along<br>
at least one line approximately parallel to one side of<br>
the substrate; they may form at least one continuous<br>
wall or form isolated studs. Preferably, they form<br>
uniformly spaced parallel lines with a pitch p which<br>
may vary from 0.2 to 30 mm, going from near one edge of<br>
the substrate as far as the opposite edge.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the<br>
cross section of the elements may adopt various forms.<br>
Thus, the cross section is, for example, of triangular<br><br>
shape, the base of the triangle being incorporated into<br>
the substrate. It may also have a concave curved<br>
geometry at the body of the; substrate and a<br>
substantially straight neck at the top. As a variant,<br>
the cross section is in the form of an arch, so that<br>
the volume constitutes a semicylinder.<br>
According to other features, the height of these<br>
elements may vary from 0.15 to 12 mm, the top of these<br>
elements may form a flat whose width is less than<br>
500 µm, whereas their base may have a width of 50 µm to<br>
50 mm.<br>
One way of using the structured substrate of the<br>
invention is, in particular, as a plasma screen which<br>
comprises said structured substrate constituting the<br>
rear face of the screen, and a flat substrate<br>
constituting the front face of the screen, the flat<br>
substrate being provided on its internal face facing<br>
the internal face of the structured substrate with a<br>
first electrode array, the plasma screen being<br>
characterized in that a second electrode array<br>
approximately perpendicular to the first array is<br>
placed on the internal face of the structured substrate<br>
in the space lying between the raised elements, while a<br>
dielectric covers said second electrode array and<br>
phosphors are housed in said space above the<br>
dielectric.<br>
According to a plasma screen variant, the second<br>
electrode array on the rear face approximately<br>
perpendicular to the first array on the front face is<br>
placed on the external face of the structured substrate<br>
and opposite the space lying between the raised<br>
elements, while phosphors occupy, surfacewise, the<br>
space lying between the raised elements.<br>
In this plasma screen variant, the rear face electrodes<br>
are advantageously placed on the external face of the<br><br>
substrate, that is to say outside the screen and not<br>
inside the screen. There are many advantages to this:<br>
- there is no longer a need for a dielectric for<br>
this electrode array as the thickness of the<br>
substrate provides the dielectric function;<br>
- once the screen has been assembled, it is<br>
always possible to carry out a repair on the<br>
electrodes;<br>
- one of the sources of internal contamination of<br>
the screens, due to evaporation and incomplete<br>
combustion of the organic compounds<br>
constituting the binders for screen-printing<br>
the electrodes, is eliminated as is also the<br>
risk of contaminating the phosphors with the<br>
electrode materials of Ag type.<br>
Finally, according to the latter screen variant, and in<br>
particular when the raised elements have a flat at<br>
their top, a third electrode array parallel to the<br>
second array may be provided, placed on the external<br>
face of the substrate and opposite the tops of the<br>
raised elements, while phosphors occupy, surfacewise,<br>
the space lying between the raised elements.<br>
The structured substrate of the invention, in<br>
particular in its use for a plasma screen, comprises a<br>
multitude of walls, constituting the ribs, which are<br>
mutually parallel and extend from one edge of the<br>
substrate to the opposite edge, the two lateral walls<br>
of the two respective edges of the substrate being of<br>
larger width than the intermediate walls so as to<br>
provide a bearing surface of sufficient contact in this<br>
peripheral region for sealing the two substrates of the<br>
screen.<br>
The structured substrate of the invention may, of<br>
course, be used in other embodiments, it being possible<br>
for the raised elements to constitute simple spacers<br>
between two walls, whether, for example, between two<br><br>
faces of an FED screen for example, or between bottom<br>
and cover of a plane lamp.<br>
According to the invention, the process for<br>
manufacturing the structured substrate is characterized<br>
in that the substrate is obtained by extrusion, flat<br>
glass being introduced under high pressure into a die<br>
heated so that the glass reaches a temperature close to<br>
the softening temperature.<br>
Preferably, glass is extruded by means of a die in<br>
order to form an intermediate substrate incorporating<br>
raised elements, which substrate has a cross section<br>
substantially identical in shape to that which it is<br>
desired to obtain, to within a homothetic ratio, and<br>
then the intermediate substrate is drawn in order to<br>
constitute the final substrate of desired cross<br>
section.<br>
More specifically, flat glass is introduced into the<br>
die which is heated so that the glass reaches a<br>
temperature close to the softening temperature, the<br>
bottom of the die being machined so as to have the<br>
cross section of the intermediate substrate to be<br>
delivered by extrusion on leaving the die, and then the<br>
intermediate substrate is drawn by drawing means with a<br>
draw ratio (f) at the temperciture close to the<br>
softening of the glass.<br>
In a process variant, it is possible for the drawing to<br>
take place in the die.<br>
This extrusion-forming process allows very precise<br>
dimensional control of a few thousandths of the objects<br>
formed, which, combined with a homogeneous defect-free<br>
glass composition, ensures precise control of the<br>
electrical capacitance formed by the electrode and the<br>
dielectric.<br><br>
This results in greater uniformity, pixel to pixel, of<br>
the voltages for igniting the ion discharge, since this<br>
uniformity is in fact dependent on the exact height of<br>
the rib, on the centering of the electrode with respect<br>
to the phosphor and on the thickness of the dielectric.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention will<br>
become apparent on reading the description which<br>
follows, in conjunction with the appended drawings in<br>
which:<br>

figure 2;<br>

apparatus for implementing the process for<br>

- figures 7a to 7d partially illustrate in cross<br>

raised elements incorporated into a substrate<br>
of the invention;<br>
- figure 8 is a partial schematic sectional view<br>
of a plasma screen according to the invention<br>
based on the geometry of the substrate<br>
illustrated in figure 7b; and<br>
- figure 9 is an additional geometrical variant<br>
of the raised elements.<br>
A known standard plasma screen as illustrated in<br>
figure 1 is composed of a first glass substrate 10 and<br>
a second substrate 11 which are parallel and placed<br>
facing each other in order to constitute the rear face<br>
and the front face of the screen, respectively. The<br><br>
substrates are flat, that is to say they do not have<br>
any particular element incorporated into their surface.<br>
Placed on the respective internal faces 22, 23 of the<br>
substrates 10, 11, which faces of the substrates face<br>
each other, are layers constituting electrode arrays 12<br>
and 13 respectively which are placed so as to be<br>
mutually perpendicular, constituting what are called,<br>
respectively, the rows and columns of the screen which<br>
define the pixels.<br>
The electrodes 12 on the rear face, for example made of<br>
silver, are covered with a dielectric 14 based on low-<br>
melting-point compounds, such as PbO, and the<br>
electrodes 13a and 13b, for example a layer of ITO, are<br>
covered with a dielectric 15, also based on PbO.<br>
The electrodes 13a and 13b of the front face generally<br>
form double electrode tracks, that is to say pairs of<br>
two lines of electrodes spaced Apart by about 7 0 to<br>
80 µm and connected together.<br>
The electrodes 12 of the rear face of the screen are<br>
also covered with a layer 16 of a phosphor. Each<br>
phosphor, of red, green or blue color, is separated by<br>
glass-based elements 20 of the "rib" type which extend<br>
in the form of continuous walls over almost the entire<br>
length of the substrate 10 along a multitude of lines<br>
parallel to the longitudinal edges of the substrate and<br>
are positioned uniformly with a pitch p of 0.3 mm for<br>
example, which depends on the size of the screen and on<br>
its resolution. The sides of the ribs are also<br>
partially covered with phosphors, that is to say down<br>
to the level of the thickness of the electrodes.<br>
The volume 17 created between the two substrates 10 and<br>
11 and in the channels 21 bounded by the ribs 20 is<br>
filled with a gas, for example a mixture of neon and<br>
xenon. During operation of the screen, the gas mixture<br><br>
is excited by applying suitable voltages to the<br>
electrodes 12, 13a and 13b, thereby generating Xe+ and<br>
Ne+ ions emitting UV photons. The UV photons then<br>
excite the phosphors, which convert the excitation<br>
energy into red, green or blue visible light.<br>
Three plasma screen variants using the structured<br>
substrate of the invention are illustrated in figures 2<br>
to 4 respectively; the elements common to the prior art<br>
are identified by the same reference numbers.<br>
Figure 2 reproduces the same arrangement of the<br>
electrodes as that, in figure 1 on the front and rear<br>
faces of the screen, the phosphors being isolated by<br>
the ribs which, not being attached as in the prior art,<br>
form an integral part of the substrate 11. The ribs lie<br>
along several uniformly spaced parallel lines of pitch<br>
p. The electrodes 12 of the rear face of the screen are<br>
placed in the channels 21 boundesd by the ribs 20, a<br>
dielectric layer 14 covering them and on the top of<br>
these layers are the phosphors 16.<br>
The variant in figure 3 benefits from the novel<br>
configuration of the structured substrate of the<br>
invention, providing a different arrangement of the<br>
rear electrodes 12. These electrodes are placed so as<br>
to face the channels 21 bounded by the ribs 20, and on<br>
the outside of the glass substrate 10 on the external<br>
face 24. No dielectric layer of the layer 14 type of<br>
the prior art for these electrodes is then necessary as<br>
the glass thickness of the substrate 10 very<br>
advantageously fulfills the role of dielectric.<br>
Although in the variants in figures 2 and 3 the glass<br>
elements are incorporated on only one 22 of the faces<br>
of the substrate, in another embodiment of the<br>
substrate, in particular for a plasma screen, it may be<br>
advantageous to form elements 20 on the two opposed<br><br>
faces 22, 24 of the substrate, as illustrated in<br>
figure 4.<br>
The raised features 20 on the face 24 are at least<br>
opposite the sides of the walls on the face 22 so that<br>
grooves 25 are created on the opposite side from the<br>
cups of the face 22 so as to house the electrodes 12,<br>
made of Ag paste, on the rear face. This configuration<br>
advantageously provides an impression which can<br>
directly receive conductive paste deposited by a<br>
squeegee, thereby making savings on the supply of<br>
screen-printing screens and on the material of the<br>
electrodes.<br>
The process for obtaining a substrate according to the<br>
invention, which intrinsically incorporates the rib-<br>
type glass elements 20 will now be described. The<br>
process for manufacturing a plasma screen will be<br>
explained later so as to demonstrate the possibilities<br>
of its implementation, which is provided by a substrate<br>
structured in this way.<br>
The process for obtaining the substrate according to<br>
one embodiment is explained with regard to the<br>
apparatus 30 diagrammatically illustrated in figure 5,<br>
which is a sectional view in a plane perpendicular to<br>
the plane of the glass ribbon. The apparatus 30<br>
comprises a furnace 31, a piston 32 for driving the<br>
glass, a die 33 capable of extruding an intermediate<br>
glass ribbon 41, a thermal regulation system 34, which<br>
gives the intermediate ribbon the temperature suitable<br>
for drawing it, a system 35 for drawing the ribbon, in<br>
order to deliver a final ribbon to the desired<br>
dimensions, and cooling means (not visible in the<br>
figure).<br>
A flat glass strip 40, such as bubble-free float glass<br>
containing no solid defects, is introduced under<br>
pressure by means of the piston 32 into the furnace 31<br><br>
and the die 33. The thickness of the glass may vary<br>
from 5 to 20 mm depending on the availability of the<br>
base material used and on the final application of the<br>
structured substrate. The die is heated so that the<br>
temperature of the glass can reach the softening<br>
temperature. The bottom 36 of the die is made of<br>
graphite for reasons of resistance to abrasion by the<br>
glass.<br>
The die bottom 36, illustrated in figure 6, is provided<br>
with a cut 36a, the pattern of which is similar to the<br>
cross section of the final substrate to be obtained, to<br>
within a homothetic ratio. Advantageously, it can be<br>
demounted from the body of the die so as to be able to<br>
change it easily in order to adapt the type of pattern<br>
to the desired profile of the substrate.<br>
Several variants of patterns obtained for the glass<br>
elements 20 are proposed in figures 7a to 7d as<br>
nonlimiting examples.<br>
Figure 7a illustrates one form of prismatic ribs having<br>
a triangular cross section, the base of the triangle<br>
being incorporated into the substrate. The vertex of<br>
the triangle is preferably truncated in order to avoid<br>
the spike effect during operation of the electrodes.<br>
The cross section of the ribs in figure 7b has, on the<br>
one hand, a concave curved geometry at the body of the<br>
substrate, such that it is composed of two curves of<br>
the exponential type which are symmetrical with respect<br>
to an axis perpendicular to the plane of the substrate<br>
and, on the other hand, a substantially straight neck<br>
at the top. The radius of curvature of the concave part<br>
may vary from 5 to 100 µm.<br>
The ribs in figure 7c have a cross section in the form<br>
of an arch, such that the volume of the ribs<br>
constitutes a semicylinder.<br><br>
It may be envisioned to combine ribs 20 of different<br>
cross sections on the same substrate.<br>
In the variant in figure 7d, there are raised elements<br>
on both faces of the substrate, these being symmetrical<br>
with respect to the plane of the body of said<br>
substrate. Such a configuration allows symmetrical<br>
cooling during the process of forming said substrate<br>
and will increase the ability of the screen to<br>
dissipate heat during operation, thanks to the effect<br>
of fins provided by the raised elements.<br>
On leaving the die, the extruded intermediate substrate<br>
ribbon 41 has the cross section of the final substrate<br>
ribbon 42 to within a homothetic ratio. It is then<br>
drawn by the drawing means 3 5 by passing, immediately<br>
downstream of the die, through the thermal regulation<br>
system 34 which has the purpose of controlling and<br>
adapting the temperature over the entire width of the<br>
ribbon, which has, because of its dissymmetrical<br>
profile, points of variable temperature. The<br>
temperature of the ribbon, which has to be the<br>
softening temperature, must be perfectly homogeneous<br>
over the entire width of said ribbon in order to<br>
guarantee a constant draw ratio f over the entire width<br>
of the strip.<br>
The draw ratio f may vary from 1 to 20 depending on the<br>
final application.<br>
Finally, the cooling system through which the final<br>
substrate strip 42 passes allows the definitive shape<br>
of the substrate to be set.<br>
Conventional flat-glass cutting means (not<br>
illustrated), or any other suitable means such as a<br>
laser, are provided for cutting the strip 42 along its<br><br>
width so as to supply structured substrates 10 to the<br>
desired lengths.<br>
The substrates thus delivered will constitute the rear<br>
faces of plasma screens, the body of the substrate<br>
having, for example, a thickness of 1 mm and the glass<br>
elements being 150 µm in height.<br>
The plasma screen of the invention as illustrated in<br>
figure 3 is manufactured in the following manner.<br>
The structured substrate 10 is held by suction, using<br>
suitable means, in a horizontal position, its external<br>
face 24 devoid of ribs being turned uppermost. A<br>
uniform silver layer in the form of a paste is<br>
deposited by screen printing on this external face.<br>
The silver paste is advantageously photosensitive so as<br>
to fix it by exposing the substrate to a UV beam.<br>
Consequently, when the layer has undergone the drying<br>
step, the substrate is turned upside down, with the<br>
internal face 22 provided with ribs turned uppermost,<br>
in order to receive the UV beam intended to sensitize<br>
the UV activators of the photosensitive silver paste.<br>
The raised geometry of the substrate, defined<br>
homogeneously by the ribs 2 0 which form in succession<br>
the walls for isolating the colors and the channels 21<br>
forming flat-bottomed cups intended to receive the<br>
phosphors, makes it possible to focus the UV rays all<br>
the better onto the bottom of the cup, so that the Ag<br>
electrodes 12 are, after development, positioned<br>
precisely along lines opposite the; cups. No photomask<br>
is then needed as in the prior art, which represents an<br>
additional pecuniary saving in the manufacturing<br>
process. Furthermore, the wall/cup structure<br>
incorporated into the substrate and the method of<br>
depositing the paste ensure that, whatever the<br>
linearity of the ribs, the Ag electrodes are self-<br><br>
aligning, this being an essential characteristic for<br>
guaranteeing a high level of uniformity of the ignition<br>
voltages during operation of the screen.<br>
The development of the electrodes 12 is carried out in<br>
a known manner by a wet route and is followed by a<br>
baking operation at high temperature of the order of<br>
550°C.<br>
The substrate with symmetrical raised features, as<br>
illustrated in figure 7d, makes it possible very<br>
advantageously to produce silver electrodes self-<br>
aligned with the ribs inside the screen, using a<br>
photosensitive silver paste, without the need for a<br>
photomask. To do this, all that is required is to<br>
deposit the photosensitive silver layer on the inside<br>
of the screen and to expose it to the ultraviolet rays<br>
via the opposed structured face, on the outside.<br>
To obtain a region for sealing the two glass<br>
substrates, as will be explained below, the ribs of the<br>
lateral ends of the substrate are not used for<br>
depositing the electrodes and phosphors; their cross<br>
section may moreover be different from that of the<br>
intermediate ribs.<br>
Immediately alongside these lateral end ribs may be<br>
reserved ribs for housing elements involved in the<br>
operation of the product, such as getters well known to<br>
those skilled in the art, these elements placed around<br>
the periphery of the image not having to be in contact<br>
with the phosphors, the plasma or the sealing frits.<br>
In the geometrical variant of the ribs with reference<br>
to figure 7b, the flatness of the tops of the ribs<br>
results in the formation, on the external face 24 of<br>
the substrate and opposite said tops, of a second<br>
electrode array 12a parallel to the electrode array 12<br>
placed opposite the cups (figure 8) . The external face<br><br>
24 is in this case plane, but it could just as well be<br>
structured as in figure 4; grooves would then be placed<br>
not only opposite the cups but also opposite the tops.<br>
This second electrode array allows, via a connection to<br>
the electrodes 12, rapid repair of the latter if they<br>
possibly become damaged.<br>
The step following the deposition of the electrodes on<br>
the rear face of the screen consists in depositing the<br>
phosphors by electrophoresis, by biasing the<br>
electrodes. This technique is well known in the<br>
manufacture of television sets, the phosphors being<br>
deposited on the front face of the cathode-ray tubes.<br>
By biasing the electrodes on the face 24 of the<br>
substrate, the phosphors may thus be deposited on the<br>
bottom of the cups of the channels 21.<br>
The voltage values applied to the electrodes are<br>
adjusted according to the partictilar geometry of the<br>
ribs.<br>
The geometry of the ribs in figure 7b, which makes it<br>
possible to obtain two arrays of mutually adjacent<br>
electrodes, facilitates the deposition of the phosphors<br>
not only in the bottom of the cups but also on the<br>
sides of the walls.<br>
After the phosphors have been dried, a sealing frit is<br>
put into place for the purpose of fastening together<br>
the two glass substrates of the screen. The structured<br>
substrate 10 is laid on a metal support fitted with<br>
suction and uniform-heating means. A sealing frit is<br>
applied around the periphery of the structured<br>
substrate 10, that is to say in the cups of the two<br>
lateral end ribs and along the two adjacent sides in<br>
the ends of the cups of the intermediate ribs.<br>
Finally, the front face substrate 11, which has the<br>
electrodes 13 screen printed beforehand, is positioned<br><br>
over the structured substrate 10 resting on the top of<br>
the ribs, the electrodes 13 of the substrate 11 lying<br>
perpendicular to the electrodes 12 of the substrate 10.<br>
The entire screen is housed in a closed chamber in<br>
which a vacuum is created in order to evacuate between<br>
the substrates. Gas is then introduced into the screen<br>
via the gap lying between the two non-compressed<br>
substrates. The two substrates are then fastened<br>
together via the sealing frit by compressing and<br>
heating the assembly in the chamber, operating under a<br>
controlled atmosphere in order to guarantee a high<br>
level of temperature uniformity.<br>
In order to benefit from the structure of the substrate<br>
with incorporated ribs, a variant in the substrate-<br>
fastening and gas-filling steps may be envisioned.<br>
Thus, with regard to the sealing frit, this may be<br>
placed only on the two sides of the structured<br>
substrate 10 which will be placed vertically in the<br>
mounted position of the screen, that is to say along<br>
the sides parallel to the ribs, thereby allowing the'<br>
channels 21 formed by the ribs to project freely. After<br>
placing the front face substrate 11 on the structured<br>
rear face substrate 10, the channels 21 of the ribs are<br>
connected by means of a sucker system to a vacuum,<br>
purging and filling device. The device carries out, in<br>
succession, the steps consisting in creating a vacuum<br>
in the channels, purging with an inert gas, such as<br>
argon and filling with the discharge gas. The free<br>
circulation of the fluids from one channel to another<br>
and the means of direct connection with said device<br>
shortens the time for carrying out these steps.<br>
The resulting effectiveness is not insignificant since<br>
the operation goes from 24 hours in the case of the<br>
conventional gas introduction solution to a few hours<br>
in the case of this method of implementation, providing<br><br>
a substantial saving on the cost of assembling the<br>
screen.<br>
Once filling with gas has been completed, the channels<br>
are closed by local heating and mechanical stamping of<br>
the edges of the two substrates that do not have a<br>
sealing frit. The other edges, associated with the<br>
sealing frit, are fastened together by compressing and<br>
heating said edges.<br>
Similar operating steps with regard to the use of the<br>
structured substrate of the invention may be applied to<br>
other operations, such as the manufacture of plane<br>
lamps.<br>
In a known manner, a plane lamp comprises two facing<br>
substrates which are held apart by means of spacers in<br>
order to form a space containing a discharge gas.<br>
For a plane lamp according to the invention, one of the<br>
two substrates is flat while the; other is structured,<br>
the raised glass elements 20 constituting the spacers.<br>
In a variant of the spacers, the glass elements are in<br>
the form of isolated studs obtained by sawing and<br>
grinding the continuous extruded ribs.<br>
Of course, the structured substrate of the invention<br>
can be used in any application which either requires a<br>
space to be maintained between two glass walls, the<br>
glass elements 20 acting as spacers, or which gives the<br>
substrate a novel technical property.<br>
For example, intended for the spacer function are FED<br>
screens and applications in the building industry where<br>
it is necessary to maintain a constant distance between<br>
two substrates. Mention may be made, for example, of<br>
vacuum double glazing or of double glazing in which it<br>
is desired to make a functional liquid circulate.<br><br>
Consequently, the dimensions of the bases, tops and<br>
heights of the raised elements 20 and the pitch between<br>
the elements, together with the thickness of the body<br>
of the substrate, vary depending on the envisioned<br>
application of the structured substrate. The table<br>
below summarizes a few values for the applications,<br>
namely plasma screen, plane lamp, FED screen and<br>
building.<br><br>
With regard to the technical novelty that a substrate<br>
of the invention may provide, it may be envisioned to<br>
produce microlenticular panels which are attached to<br>
flat display screens so as to obtain a three-<br>
dimensional perception of the image. A microlenticular<br>
panel thus consists of a substrate according to the<br>
invention, which is flat on one of its faces intended<br>
to be placed on the screen, and structured on its<br>
opposite face with semicylindrical raised elements<br>
forming the lenses, as illustrated in figure 9. The<br>
thickness of the body of the substrate may be between 2<br>
and 5 mm, the base of a raised element 20 or the pitch<br>
of the lenses may vary from 0.15 to 2 mm, and the<br>
radius of curvature of the semicylinders may be between<br>
1 and 3 mm.<br><br>
