Pharmaceutical Compositions Comprising Peranhydroclodextrin<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a peranhydro-cyclodextrin ,a drug and a carrier, to the use of a peranhydrocyclodextrin as a drug transport enhancer (e.g. permeation enhancer), and to the use of a peranhydrocyclodextrin in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition as a synergistic adjunctive system.<br>
The synthesis of peranhydrocyclodextrins was described as from 1991 (Gadelle A. and Defaye J., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.. (1991), 30, 78-79; Ashton P. R., Ellwood P.. Staton I. and Stoddart J. F. Angew. Chem. Int. ed. Engl., (1991) 30. 80-81) and the authors describe that these derivatives have interesting solubilities both in water and in organic solvents.<br>
As used herein, peranhydrocyclodextrins refer to per(3,6-anhydro)cyclodextrins, wherein the cydodextrin may be alpha, beta or gamma or a mixture thereof, and wherein each molecule contains at least five 3,6-anhydro-glucopyranose units. Representative examples of said peranhydrocyclodextrins are hexakis(3,6-anhydro)-a-cyclodextrin, heptakis(3,6-anhydro)-p-cyclodextrin, octakis(3,6-anhydro)-y-cyclodextrin.<br>
Typically, the per(3,6-anhydro)cyclodextrins of the alpha, beta or gamma cydodextins of the present invention may contain very small amounts of one non anhydrated glucopyranose units and tiny amounts of two non anhydrated glucopyranose units.<br>
The amount of per(3,6-anhydro)cyclodextrin typically ranges from 0.0001 - 80% by weight of total composition, preferably from 0.001 - 70% by weight, more preferably from 0.01 - 65% and also from 0.1 - 60% by weight.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically effective drug, a peranhydrocyclodextrin and a carrier are not described in the art.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention pertains to a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a pharmaceutically effective drug, a per(3,6-anhydro)cydodextrin and a carrier. A preferred pharmaceutical composition is a pharmaceutical composition for topical administration. A more preferred is an ophthalmic composition.<br><br>
The compositions of the present invention seem to have a high permeation faciitating efficacy<br>
as compared to the prior art compositions, such as for example hydroxypropyl-gamma-<br>
cydodextrin.<br>
Accordingly another object of this Invention is the use of a peranhydrocydodextrin as a<br>
permeation enhancer and/or drug transport enhancer, virtually through any mammal tissue.<br>
Accordingly, the peranhydrocyclodextrins are useful in the enhancement of the bioavailability<br>
of any pharmaceutically effective drug.<br>
In an embodiment the invention pertains to the use of a per(3.6-anhydro)cyclodextrin in the enhancement of the bioavailability of a pharmaceutically effective drug.<br>
It also pertains to the use of a per(3,6-anhydro)cyclodextrin in the manufacture of a medicament for the enhancement of the bioavailability of a pharmaceutically effective drug.<br>
The invention also pertains to the use of a per(3,6-anhydro)cydodextrin to enhance drug permeation through cell membrane, wherein said membrane is preferably an ocular membrane, said drug being preferably administered topically to said cell membrane.<br>
It further pertains to the use of a per(3,6-anhydro)cyclodextrin in the manufacture of a topical phamiaceutical medicament for the treatment of a disease being treatable by topical treatment, wherein said medicament comprises a per(3,6-anhydro)cyclodextrin, a carrier and a drug.<br>
The invention further pertains to a method of improving drug permeability through (mammalian) tissue (through cell membrane), which method comprises the steps of: Preparing a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a per(3,6-anhydro)cyclodextrin, an effective amount of a drug, and a carrier, by conventionally admixing the individual components; and Administering said pharmaceutical composition to said tissue.<br>
While applicant does not wish to be bound to any theory, applicant currently considers the following aspects regarding cell membrane permeation and the enhancement thereof:<br><br>
Eventually, the peranhydrocyclodextrins of the present invention may utilize cation binding cyclodextrins in order to alter normal physiological functions of membrane ion-channels and pumps, the cation-dependent energy sources resulting in an enhanced drug permeation across biological membranes.<br>
It is currentiy believed in the art that all membrane transport processes require:<br>
-permeability of the substance through the lipid bilayer, and<br>
-availability of an energy source for transport<br>
The latter factor appears to be related - among others, and as described in the state of the<br>
art - to Ca"^ ions, since Oie Ca"^ ATP-ase enzyme shall be an integral membrane protein<br>
participating in most of the membrane transport processes.<br>
The lipid bilayer of biological membranes shall be intrinsically inpermeable to ions and polar<br>
molecules. The permeability of such substances shall be conferred by two types of<br>
membrane proteins: the pumps and the channels.<br>
Pumps seem to use a source of free energy (mainly from ATP, active transport) to transport<br>
ions-<br>
The channels seem to allow the flow of ions rapidly across membranes, (e.g. passive<br>
transport)<br>
Anhydro-cyclodextrin derivatives of the present invention (in its function as permeation<br>
enhancers) may affect these membrane protein-related transport processes resulting in<br>
enhanced drug transport through biological membranes.<br>
The presence of anhydro cyclodextrins, moreover, may result in alteration of ion potentials in<br>
the outer surface of the membrane, thus changing the ion distribution In the extracellular and<br>
intracellular space. This could lead to the change of membrane physiological functions and<br>
hence may result in the observed enhanced transport.<br>
As oral administration is the most common and convenient route of drug delivery, many strategies have been developed to tackle the various problems which are associated with poor oral bioavailability.<br>
Altough these individual strategies are successfully applied to some drugs, a low oral bioavailability is very often the result of multiple factors and therefore, still requires a clear improvement.<br><br>
The present invention offers a solution to the above problem by the use of a per-anhydro-cyclodextrins in a pharmaceutical composition.<br>

Example 1. Preparation of hexakis(3,6-anhydro)-a-cyclodextrin potassium chloride<br>
pentadecahydrate.<br>
Freshly dried a-cyclodextrin (48.6 g, 0.050 mol) is dissolved in freshly opened dimethyl formamide (800 cm3) at room temperature. N-bromosuccinimide (142.4 g. 0.80 mol), and triphenylphosphine (148.6 g. 0.57 mol) is added in one portion to the solution at room temperature. The color of the reaction mixture becomes orange like as the TPP is added. The reaction temperature increases up to about 100 C at the end of TPP addition. The reaction mixture is immersed onto a pre-heated (60-70 C) oil-bath and stirred for 3 hrs at 80-85 C. When the reaction Is completed, the reaction mixture is poured onto icy water (3000 cm3). Ultrasonicated for several minutes and allowed to stand for crystallization (ovemight). The yellow solid is filtered, washed with water (3 times 500 cm3, pH= 2-3. 3-4, 4-5), dried under reduced pressure (5-10 kPa at moderate temperature (40-45 C) in the presence of P2O5. The<br><br>
obtained solid (250,6 g) contains TPPO and brominated a-cyclodextrins. The product is used for the preparation of anhydro-a-cyclodextrin without further purification. Potassium hydroxide (112.2 g, 2.0 mol) is dissolved In 3:1 MeOH/H2O (1500 cm3) at room temperature and tetrat&gt;romo-a-cyclodextrin (250.6 g) is added spoonwise without additional cooling. The color of the reaction mixture disappears, then becomes opaque or precipitation is formed, the re-dissolution of the solid is observed and the solution again becomes yellow, which turns to brown upon elongated heating. The reaction is practically complete as the addition is finished. After 60 min the reaction mixture is cooled, stirrer is removed and methanol is removed by evaporation. When the methanol is removed, 200 cm3 water is added. As the reaction mixture is free from MeOH, cooled to room temperature and neutralized (pH: --5.5) by cc. HCI. Charcoal is added to the suspension (20 g), and stirred for 1 hr. Filtered and washed with water (3 times 40 cm3), and water is removed by freeze-drying (25 C/0.06-0.1 Pa). The obtained solid (light brown solid 220 g), contains KCI and KBr. TLC has few information about the composition due to the high inorganic salt content. The obtained product (220 g) is refluxed with MeOH (550 cm3) for 30 min. and allowed to stand for crystallization (overnight).<br>
The precipitate is filtered off, washed with MeOH (2*100 cm3) and MeOH is removed by evaporation (55-60 C/10-15 kPa then 95-100 C/0.05-0.1 kPa. dark brown solid foam 29.8 g). The solid obtained from the evaporation (59.6 g) is dissolved in water (1200 cm3). The pH of the solution is adjusted (pH:8,7 =&gt; 5.5) with 1 N HCI (62 cm3) and clarified with charcoal (15 g) stirred at 25 C (overnight), filtered, washed with water (3 times 100 cm3) and water was removed (58 g, 40 C/1-2 kPa, then 95-100 C/1-2 kPa).

When the reaction is completed (approx. 20 hrs), the reaction mixture is cooled by addition of dry-ice. The formed lithium carbonate is filtered off. and solvents are removed by evaporation. The obtained solid is treated with acetone (100 cm3), then dissolved<br><br>
in methanol (100 cm3) and ions are removed by addition of strong anion- (25 g) tlien cation-exchanger (40 g). The ion-free solution is clarified by charcoal (2 g) and removal of methanol<br>
resulted in almost white solid (3.0 g). Mp: 230-235 C, [d]25d -82.5 (air-dry substance),<br>

The yellow solid is filtered, washed with water (3 times 200 cm3). pH= 2-3. 3-4. 4-5). dried under reduced pressure (5-10 kPa at moderate temperature (40-45 C) in the presence of P2O5. The obtained solid (229 g) contains TPPO and brominated 7-cyclodextrins. The product is dissolved in methanol and the pH of the solution is adjusted to pH 9-10 with sodium methoxide. The pH-shift results in crystalline precipitation of the product. The crystalline material is removed by filtration (28.8 g, 80 % theor. yield).<br>
Octakis(6-deoxy-6-bromo)-γ-yclodextrin (10.8 g. 0.006 mol) is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and lithium hydroxide (6.0 g. 0.24 mol) is added at stirred for 10 hrs at 70 C. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and treated with ion-exchangers (100 g of strong anion- and 100 g of strong cation-exchanger), ion-exchangers are removed by filtration, washed with DMSO (3 times 100 cm3), then DMSO is removed in vacuo, and the obtained waxy solid was treated with acetone. Solid is filtered off and washed with acetone<br>
