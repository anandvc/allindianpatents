				<td>Pharmaco Diagnosis Test targeting oncology and neurodegeneration<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of medicine and biology. It concerns a novel test for screening and for therapeutic follow-up in oncology. More particularly, it relates to diagnostic and/or therapeutic tests in oncology and on neurodegenerative diseases. Molecular targeting by peptide vectors and antibodies or by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) opens a new concept of interdependence for diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Indeed, they now go hand in hand, thus opening the path to pharmacodiagnosis. Proper understanding of the balance between over and under expression of genes according to their location in different cellular compartments and as a function of the proliferation state opens new perspectives for a more accurate differential analysis.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART<br>
Age-related neurodegenerative diseases and cancers both involve a modification of the physiological process of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Neuronal death is abnormally accelerated during neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. On the other hand, the cancerization process corresponds to a blocking of apoptosis, which results in an uncontrolled multiplication of cells. The link between these two processes has currently become a major field of investigation in research on aging.<br>
<br>
The control of the balance between cell division (mitosis), differentiation and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is fundamental during normal physiological processes, including embryonic development, tissue regeneration and aging. An impairment of this balance can lead to major pathological situations such as the formation of tumors or some neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
Cancer is one of the principal causes of mortality throughout the world. Over the course of the last generation, while the percentages of deaths related to cardiac and cardiovascular diseases and a large number of other diseases has decreased, the number of deaths related to the various forms of cancer has increased.<br>
Despite the rapid advance in our understanding of the various forms of cancer, the low survival rates can generally be attributed to inadequate diagnosis and inadequate treatment. Most tumors can only be detected when they reach a size of approximately 1 cm. Since a continuously developing tumor takes a relatively short period of time to evolve to a stage which is incompatible with survival, this leaves little time for a therapeutic intervention. Early diagnosis therefore becomes the key to success for the treatment of cancer.<br>
For a multitude of reasons, early diagnosis remains illusory for most forms of cancer. For certain forms of cancer, disease-specific markers are not available or are only available at an advanced stage of the disease, making diagnosis difficult. In other forms of cancer, the markers are available but are not always specific for the disease or they may be associated with its benign form.<br>
Skin cancer for example, is the most widespread cancer in Canada. In 1992 alone, 50 300 new cases of skin cancer were reported, compared with 19 3 00 cases of lung cancer,  16 200 cases of colorectal cancer and<br>
15 7 00 cases of breast cancer. In o,ther words, skin cancer is as common as the three main types of cancer combined. Its incidence continues to increase, with 64 200 new cases thereof in 1997, corresponding to an increase of 14 000 cases in 5 years. In particular, the incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing at a rate of 2% per year. Early diagnosis remains the key to an effective treatment. A malignant tumor is readily accessible and can be removed with minor surgery. In fact, recovery is 100% if skin cancer is detected early enough. Early diagnosis of skin cancer remains, however, difficult. This type of cancer is not just a single disease but an entire range of conditions related to one another, which appear similar in many cases upon visual inspection. A diagnosis on the basis of such an inspection is therefore subjective. A basocellular epithelioma or a spinocellular epithelioma have very different clinical developments. A basocellular epithelioma spreads out laterally over the surface of the skin, without penetrating into the deeper skin layers. Thus, although it can be disfiguring, a basocellular epithelioma rarely develops metastases and is rarely fatal. However, a spinocellular epithelioma causes metastases and is often fatal. Therefore it becomes important to be able to distinguish between these two types of skin cancer and to be able to locally treat them by molecular targeting such as small interfering RNA (siRNA). A definitive diagnosis of skin cancer requires a biopsy and histological analysis.<br>
Colon cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women in North America (16 200 cases per year). Early detection, leading to an early intervention, has demonstrated that treatment success and-survival rate can be improved. For example, the 5-year survival rate is 92% for a patient whose disease was detected at an early stage, whereas the rate drops to approximately 60% in patients with a<br>
 <br>
localized cancer, and to approximately 6% in those with metastases. However, only a third of colon cancers are detected at an early stage. One of the reasons for this delay in diagnosis is the absence of a sensitive, relatively inexpensive, non-invasive screening test.<br>
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women, together with colon cancer. The mortality rate is the highest among cancers affecting women.<br>
There are very few diagnostic markers allowing the detection of breast cancer and they only have a predictive value of 20%. There are no markers, either, which can detect or determine the invasiveness or the aggressiveness of metastatic cancer cells or which permit therapeutic monitoring. Given its heterogeneity, breast cancer has the greatest interest in being studied by biochips, which would allow therapeutic adjustments depending on the under and over expression of genes of the Liv21 complex.<br>
Over the last few years, considerable progress has been made in understanding how oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. One of the main targets of these regulators is the family of E2F-type transcription factors (E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, E2F4 etc..) in the E2F and RB protein signalling pathway. These proteins play a central role in controlling cell division by coupling the regulation of the genes required for progression of the cell cycle with extracellular signals (mitogens, proliferation inhibitors). They behave as oncogenes by stimulating tumor cell proliferation.<br>
Among the expressed genes are found:<br>
- overexpression of the E2F4 transcription factor and the c-myc oncogene which induce apoptosis of post-<br>
mitotic cells by accumulation of oxygenated reactants (Tanaka, 2002);<br>
the gene p53, which belongs to the tumor suppressor gene family, blocks the cell cycle in the case of DNA lesion. It has now been demonstrated that this gene is also involved in the progression of apoptosis (Oren, 1994; Yonish-Rouach, 1996);<br>
the cyclin Dl, one of the proteins constituting the regulatory subunits of cell cycle kinases, which is essential for cell cycle progression. This protein is also expressed during apoptosis in various cell types (Han et al, 1996; Pardo et al, 1996).<br>
chkl  and 2,  crb2,  p21 and other oncogenes and cytokines such as TNF alpha etc...<br>
It would be of great interest to have novel diagnostic methods detecting the presence of cancer with greater specificity and making it possible to distinguish between aggressive cancer cells with the tendency to metastasize and those which are more localized and have a lower probability of metastasizing. A marker capable of revealing cell proliferation would therefore be of great use. ki 67 and Cafl are nuclear markers indicating the proliferation state of many cancers {Almouzny; Curie Institut). Liv21 complex genes will be the cytoplasmic markers at least equal and complementary to the previously identified nuclear ones.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a novel test for screening for reinduction of the cell cycle targeting oncology. It is a diagnostic test and a prognostic test for various- cancers (breast cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, glioblastoma, sarcoma,   leukemia,  etc.).  More  particularly,  the<br>
invention concerns the use of the genes or proteins of the Liv21 complex and of their derivatives as therapeutic tools or as diagnostic and prognostic markers for cancers. The invention therefore concerns the detection of the LIV21 gene or LIV21 protein with a kit comprising LIV21-specific antibodies or LIV21 specific probes. The present invention also consist in using all the proliferation markers and transcription factors which play a role in the cancerization and - in some cases - neurodegeneration process.<br>
Thus, the invention lies in the fabrication of diagnostic DNA, proteins and antibody arrays including known antibodies directed against various proteins of the LIV21-associated complex according to the phases of the cell cycle, that is, without restriction thereto, antibodies specific for RBP2, E2F4, E2F1, SUMO, HDACl,crb2, Int2, cmd2, cycE/cdk2,' cdkl, CREB1 and p300, Rb, pl07 and pl30 of the pocket protein family. In addition, antibodies specific for NFkB, cdc2A, mdm2, p21, p53, p65, Ki67 CAF1, cyclins A and Dl. The protein arrays will make it possible to study protein interactions and post-translational modifications, more particularly phosphorylations and methylations of certain proteins, which signal a characteristic state of the diseased cell different to protein interactions and metabolism in normal cell. The state of expression and of silencing of certain genes is different in diseased cells and in normal cells. The DNA arrays will permit to study in the nuclear cells extracts and in addition cytoplasmic or membrane cell extracts the under expressions or over expressions of genes and the ratio between genes and between proteins of the Liv21 complex and associated partners.<br>
A first objective of the present invention is to demonstrate a method for the detection and prognosis of cancer and of its metastatic potential. Preferably, the cancer is selected from breast cancer, bladder cancer,<br>
<br>
ovarian cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, a sarcoma, a leukemia and glyoblastoma, without being limited thereto.<br>
One aspect of the present invention consists of the use of LIV21 complex as a prognostic indicator for cancer and his therapeutic monitoring. We define the Liv21 complex by the protein extract and peptides studied by mass spectrometry such as Maldi and ESIMSMS or Maldi TofTof. The said extract has been obtaing by binding of the Liv21 complex to one of its polyclonal antibodies described in the patent (PCT/FR2006/000510). The -complex is defined by its mass spectrometry global profile (Fig 5) and the number and the molecular weight of protein extracts bands obtained on the acrylamide gels of Figures 1A and IB as a function of temperature at which the sample is submitted and of described migration conditions.<br>
In fact, when for example Liv21F peptide is located in the cytoplasm and we reveal directly for example by in situ hybridization or by biochip analysis its higher expression in the cytoplasm, the cancer cells in the tissues are aggressive. Conversely, when the LIV21 gene expression product or the expression of Liv21F peptide is preferentially located in the cell nucleus, this is a prognostic indicator that the cells of the tissue are differentiated and quiescent and therefore noninvasive. The effectiveness of a cancer treatment can also be monitored by the traceability of this Liv21 protein complex, and of its derivatives and ratios with the associated proteins but also by Diagmicroarray or biochip including among others this protein and its Liv21 associated complex (Figure 20 and Figure 21).<br>
Moreover, detection of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe) is also advantageous since it has been determined that PKCe phosnhorylates  the  Liv21 protein in order to<br>
<br>
maintain it in the cytoplasm. Thus, a significant increase in PKCe is indicative of the presence of cancer cells. Moreover, the LIV21/PKC ratio increases in the cytoplasmic fraction of cancer cells. The same is true of the detection of HDAC1, which has been shown to be involved ;in PML/SUMO/Rb/HDACl. More generally, the HDACs family plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. When the HDACs are overexpressed, they induce tumor suppressor gene silencing, hence the advantage of using HDAC inhibitors in therapy, combined with other inhibitors which regulate the metabolic pathway involving the Liv21 protein complex which contains the proteins: Liv21, E2F4, Histones H4, H3, SUMO, PML, Rb, E2F1 etc...<br>
In addition, the detection of the E2F1 and/or E2F4 proteins is advantageous. In fact, the LIV21 protein forms a complex with E2F4, which is capable of inhibiting the expression of the E2F1 gene in the nucleus, E2F1 gene expression being a sign of cell proliferation. Thus, a decrease in the association of LIV21 with the E2F4 protein is indicative of the presence of cancer cells. Similarly, the presence of the E2F1 protein in the nucleus is indicative of the presence of cancer cells.<br>
Consequently, the present invention concerns a method for the detection of cancer cells in a biological tissue sample (for example, breast, ovary, endometrium, bladder, melanoma, prostate, glioblastoma, etc.) from patients, this method comprising the detection of the products of expression of the LIV21 complex genes in the nucleus comparatively to the same products in the cytoplasm of the cells in the biological tissue sample from said patient. A localization of said products of expression of the LIV21 gene in the cytoplasm is indicative of the presence of cancer cells. A localization of said products of expression of the<br>
<br>
LIV21 complex genes in the nucleus is indicative of the presence of noncancer cells. Preferably, localization of said products of expression of the LIV21 complex genes in the cytoplasm are indicative of the presence of invasive and/or metastatic cancer cells.<br>
Optionally, the method according to the present invention also comprises the detection of the product of expression of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of the protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe) gene, the E2F1 gene and the E2F4 gene. The method can in particular comprise the detection of the product of expression of two of these genes or of the three genes. Moreover, at least one of the ratios LIV2l/PKCe, LIV21/E2F4 and LIV21/E2F1 can be determined in the present method. This ratio can be determined in the cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus preferably separated. Preferably, these ratios are determined in the nucleus. Preferably, these ratios are compared with those obtained in a normal cell.<br>
The level of expression of each enzyme or polypeptide of the SUMO/Rb/HDAC complex or, for certain cell types, of the PML/SUMO/Rb/HDAC complex is an additional indicator of the proliferative state of the cell.<br>
These ratios of expression or silencing can be detected via the protein expression or inhibition level themselves in the protein arrays (biochips) fabricated according to conventional methods described (Lubman David M, QIAO TIECHENG Alex, Mathew ABY J etc..) or novel tools for the automation of hybridization and of reading, US2004152212 and Yu Xinglong US 2005019828 and<br>

Peter.<br>
Before describing the principle of these biochips, which are well known by man skilled in the art, we will give the following definitions:<br>
<br>
The biological sample can be in particular sample of blood, serum, saliva, tissue, tumor, bone marrow, circling cells from the patient. The biological sample can be recovered by any type of sampling know by those skilled in the art. According to the present invention, we consider a biological sample any material allowing the detection of expression of a target gene. The biological material can include in particular proteins, or nucleic acids such as desoxyribonucleoic acid (DNA) and rybonucleic acid (RNA) . The nucleic acid can in particular be an RNA (rybonucleic acid). According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the biological material comprises nucleic acids, in particular RNAs and even more specifically total RNAs. Total RNAs include transfer RNAs, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), such as mRNAs transcribed from the target gene, but also transcribed from any other gene, and ribosomal RNAs. This biological material includes specific material of the target gene, such as in particular mRNAs transcribed from the target gene or proteins issued from these RNAs, but it can also include material unspecific to the target gene, such as in particular mRNAs transcribed from a gene different from the target gene, tRNAs, rRNAs issued from other genes than the target gene. When the extracts to be studied consist of cell cultures, they will preferably be analyzed on fresh cultures (with or without previous treatment) that underwent an extraction protocol separating cellular compartments. This type of kit know by those skilled in the art allows the specific extraction of membranes or of solely the cytoplasmic or nuclear or cytoskeletal content in a differential fashion by using different solutions. For instance, the kit Proteo extract (ref 53 9790) from Calbiochem can be used.<br>
The other aspect of the present invention is the use of the genes and the proteins mentioned above as markers for the invasiveness and the metastatic aggressiveness<br>
<br>
of cancer cells of the prostate, , colon, bladder, melanoma, ovary, endometrium and cervix, and cancers in neurobiology or in ORL etc... In fact, sequential pharmacodiagnostic tests during treatment monitoring will permit to observe, by comparing at different time points, variations of the expression level or of their silencing and therefore to better evaluate the treatment efficiency, to readjust these treatments in the case of a suitable multitherapy in such a way that the physiological equilibrium of the different products of genes involved in metabolic complexes are maintained. The plasticity of these equilibriums justifies the use of diagnostic biochips and for the therapeutic monitoring with the most pertinent genes of metabolic complexes involved in the physiology of anarchic proliferation in the case of breast cancer, which is highly heterogeneous.' Therefore each individual or each phenotypic subgroup of individuals will show an under or over expression profile of genes of the metabolic complexes which is specific to him.<br>
In one embodiment, the expression product of the genes is detected at the mRNA level. mRNA can de detected by RT-PCR analysis (cf following examples). It can also be detected by Northern blotting analysis.<br>
In one alternative embodiment, the expression product of the genes is detected at the protein level or at the peptide level characterising the Liv21 complex and its interacting partners. Preferably, the protein and/or the Liv21 Protein complex is detected using a specific antibody. For example, the protein can be detected by Western blotting analysis and by SPR. In a preferred embodiment, it is detected by immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, microfluidic or radiography, or by peroxidase labeling.<br>
In one specific embodiment of the method comprising the<br>
<br>
detection of the expression product of- the PKCe gene, a significant increase in PKCs is indicative of the presence of cancer cells. Moreover, the method can also comprise the determination of the LIV2l/PKCs ratio in the nucleus, the membranes and the cytoplasm. This ratio can be compared with the one observed in a normal cell. An increase in the LIV2l/PKCe ratio in the cytoplasmic fraction is indicative of cancer cells.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the method comprising the detection of the expression product of the E2F4 gene, the method comprises the detection of the association of LIV21 with the E2F4 protein, a decrease in this association in the cell nucleus being indicative of the presence of cancer cells. Moreover, the method can also comprise the determination of the LIV21/E2F4 ratio in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm. This ratio can be compared with the one observed in a normal cell.<br>
In an additional embodiment of the method comprising the detection of the expression product of the E2F1 gene, the presence of the E2F1 protein in the nucleus is indicative of the presence of cancer cells. Moreover, the method can also comprise the determination of the LIV21/E2F1 ratio in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm. This ratio can be compared with that observed in a normal cell.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the method comprises the detection of a labelled small interfering RNA in order to target, its specific sequence and therefore signal trie IOCUS of messenger RNA expression of the gene of interest. In this way, the specific small interfering RNA can be -used as a diagnosis marker similarly to an antibody. The specific siRNA would allow to locate in a specific case such as in extamporaneous tissues or any kind of sample from a patient, such as cancer tissue<br>
<br>
sample, the fluorescence signal or any other marker used on the siRNA is found in a cellular compartment on the sample. An siRNA targeting the E2F1, E2F4 and PKC epsilon would allow a complementary diagnosis.<br>
The method according to the present invention allows in particular the detection of metastasized cancer, therapeutic monitoring and/or recurrences following treatment.<br>
A second aspect of the invention concerns the human LIV21 protein and also the fragments thereof. More particularly, the present invention concerns a purified or recombinant isolated human LIV21 protein. It concerns in particular an isolated polypeptide comprising a peptide sequence selected among SEQ ID Nos 1 to 5 and more broadly selected 'among the peptide sequences characterizing it and obtained by MALDI (Figures 3, 4 and 5) and NanoLC-ESI-MS.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide comprises the three peptide sequences SEQ ID Nos 1 and 2 and 3 . Preferably, the LIV21 complex comprises proteins with a leucine zipper motif, a basic domain characteristic of DNA binding domains, and a nuclearization sequence. In an even more preferred embodiment, the present invention concerns the polypeptides with peptide sequences characterized by spectrograms of Figures 3, 4, 5 of gel bands 1, 2 and 3, selected among SEQ ID Nos 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and a hundred additional non ordered sequences supplement (i.e. listing sequences in annex), the unmatched fragments identified in the Maldi Tof analysis (cf. Figures 3, 4, 5), these unmatched fragments corresponding to the masses M (H-f) untagged characterized in part the Liv21 protein and some elements of-the Liv21 protein complex.<br>
A third aspect of the invention concerns an antibody, which binds specifically to a polypeptide according to<br>
<br>
the present invention. More particularly, the antibody can bind specifically to a polypeptide comprising a peptide sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos 1-12 0, preferably from SEQ ID Nos 1 and 2 or 3 and/or 15 or 51, or a sequence having more than 80% identity to said sequences. The present invention concerns in particular an anti-LIV21 serum produced by immunizing an animal or a human with a polypeptide according to the present invention, in particular a polypeptide comprising a peptide sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos 1-120, preferably from SEQ ID Nos 1-5 and 51, or a sequence having 70%, 80% or 90% identity to said sequences.<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention concerns a kit for the detection of cancer cells in a biological sample from a patient,  this kit  comprising one or more  elements selected from the group consisting of an antibody which binds specifically to human LIV21 according to the present invention and an anti-LIV21 serum according to the present invention, a specific oligonucleotide mRNA probe of Liv2l and a pair of primers specific of mRNA. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the kit also comprises means for detecting the product of expression of a gene or a specific oligonucleotide mRNA probe of factors selected from the group consisting of the protein kinase C epsilon (PKCE) gene, the E2F1 gene and the E2F4 gene. But also the antibodies in a specific antibodies  microarray  from  the  antibodies  group consisting  of  RBP2,  SUMO,  HDAC,  TNFalpha,  crb2, cycE/cdk2,  cdkl,  CREB1,  p300,  Rb, pl07,  pl30, NFkB, cdc2A,  mdm2,  p21,  p53,  p65.  It  also  comprises Microarray with said proteins above and specific peptides known by a person skilled^ in the art,- their antigens being referenced. The combination of these different peptides corresponding to the specific interactions of protein  complexes  acting  in metabolic  deregulation, induces anarchical proliferation, which is a specific feature of cancer or neurodegeneration.<br>
The invention concerns the use of an antibody specific for human LIV21 for the diagnosis of cancer, and antibodies specific for its protein complex, but also specific antibodies for RBP2, SUMO, HDAC, TNFalpha, crb2, cycE/cdk2, cdkl, CREB1, p300, Rb, PML, pl07 and pl30 NFKB, cdc2A, mdm2, p21, p53, p65. Also, the invention concerns the use- of primers pair or LIV21 specific probe for the cancer diagnosis. Preferably, the diagnosis is performed ex vivo on samples from a patient (puncture, biopsy, ground cellular material, bronchial aspirations, DNA/protein/antibodies arrays, hydrophobic or ion metal supports, etc).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the identification of antigens in cell lysates by immunoprecipitation. The analysis of the physical interaction of various proteins associated in the LIV21 complex as E2F4 and E2F1 has been studied by coimmunoprecipitation of protein complexes. This analysis has made it possible to demonstrate novel markers, which has a diagnostic and prognostic use for cancer (i.e. PCT/FR2006/000510) .<br>
Begin by using the one dimensional and two dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis (Figures 1 and 2) , the protein samples corresponding to the putative protein and to the elements of the complex were extracted from the gels and digested with trypsin (Promega) in order to be analysed by MALDI (Figures 3 to 5) and ESI MS/MS mass spectrometry. The results, when put up against proteomic databanks, made it possible to reveal several peptide sequences of interest, including some given as an example (Figures 6 and 7) , some being found in humans with very significant scores (splicing of histatin, etc., Figures 8 and 9), these sequences were used as primers (once reverse-transcribed to cDNA) for screening a library formed from breast cancer-specific MCF7 cells (Figures 10 to 17).<br>
The cloning made it possible to bring to the fore about twenty clones out of the 150 clones obtained, of which ten clones were sequenced and characterize the new LIV21 complex (Figure 17). Based on these sequences, siRNAs were determined in order to allow regulation of silencing type within this metabolic complex of interest so as to develop therapeutic applications (Figure 18).<br>
In post-mitotic cells, apoptosis could correspond to an aborted attempt at mitosis. It is in this context that<br>
<br>
the application of LIV21 has been developed. The inventor has identified sequences of the LIV21 gene. Using the LIV21 antibody on affinity columns he has been able to extract peptides of the LIV21 protein; he has also used a second approach by means of a coimmunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) in order to have larger amounts of proteins (Example 1). Based on peptide sequences of the LIV21 protein, obtained by mass spectrometry (Example 2), primers which make it possible to amplify a cDNA fragment were designed (Example 3}. After culturing and amplification of MCF7 line cells, extraction and purification of RNAs, RT PCRs and cloning in a shuttle vector were carried out, and then screening of the resistant colonies and sequencing made it possible to reveal sequences characterizing the genes of the LIV21 complex (Examples 4 and 5). More than twenty characteristic clones out of 150 clones were studied. The cDNA of these clones was used to screen a library prepared from the total mRNA of MCF7 cells. The sequence of this new products are new transcription factors, the nuclear translocation of which change role and function. Furthermore, it forms heterodimers with other transcription factors and certains bind to DNA.<br>
Using Northern blotting, the inventor then followed the expression of this new product during development, from the embryonic stage. It was observed that the amount of the LIV21 protein increases as development progresses, i.e. as a quiescent cell state becomes established. Through the same strategy, the inventor showed that the LIV21/E2F4 complex inhibited the expression of E2F1. This complex could correspond to a new checkpoint in the arrest of cell proliferation.<br>
The discovery of this novel molecule LIV21 could have a diagnostic value for the following reasons. By carrying<br>
 <br>
out a screening of the localization of LIV21 in about ten human tumors, the inventor has been able to observe that, in all proliferating tumor cells, this protein is cytoplasmic instead of nuclear with Liv21 antibody (example 8). It is not therefore in the correct cellular compartment to be active on the arrest of cell multiplication.<br>
It has thus been possible to observe the presence of LIV21 in mammals. The panel of LIV21 expression as a function of cell state (mitotic cycles, cell in the resting state, differentiation) has been studied on tissues originating from various mammals. Protein analyses on the various tissue samples have confirmed that the expression of this transcription factor appears to be associated with a progression toward a quiescent cell state (arrest of mitoses and entry into differentiation). LIV21 is present in actively proliferating tumor cell lines and its expression is essentially cytoplasmic. The same results are obtained on human mammary adenocarcinomas (example 9).<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a novel test for screening for anomalies of the reinduction of the cell cycle .pharmacodiagnostic test is based on the study of the mechanism of action of the novel gene, encoding a potential novel transcription factor called LIV21, which down-regulates proliferation. LIV21 is implicated in the arrest of cell proliferation. The isolated cDNA fragment encodes for a protein containing  a leucine zipper motif, a basic domains characteristic of DNA binding domains, and a nuclearization sequence, similar to the nuclear receptor binding factor OR11H6, cd53 antigen with the 400 bp fragment. For example, we note that LIV21 is cytoplasmic when the cells proliferate, whereas it becomes nuclear when the cells become quiescent. The characterization of this factor suggests a new pathway for down-regulating cell proliferation,<br>
by virtue of its association with one of the members of the EF family: E2F4. The latter is known to negatively regulate the cell cycle by association with the P13 0 protein or pocket protein of the RB family.<br>
The localization observed for LIV21 in tumor cells (cytoplasmic localization) and in physiological cells (nuclear localization) suggests, in any event, that its function is disturbed when cell development becomes anarchical.<br>
The characterization of this molecule and the study of the timing and the topology of its expression also indicate that the expression and the localization of this ubiquitous transcription factor are regulated as a function of cell state: greater expression and nuclear localization for cells which have exited mitotic cycles, weak expression and cytoplasmic localization for actively proliferating cells such as human tumor cells.<br>
LIV21 appears to be a key molecule for stabilizing another transcription factor (E2F4) in the cell nucleus and thus for inducing an arrest of cell proliferation.<br>
Furthermore, it has been shown that the localization of LIV21 in the cytoplasmic compartment is regulated by PKCs. In fact, when LIV21 is phosphorylated by PKCe, LIV21 is located in the cytoplasmic compartment. Conversely, when the phosphorylation of LIV21 by PKCs is inhibited, LIV21 is located in the nuclear compartment.<br>
By studying exhaustively metabolic complexes including LIV21, E2F4, HDAC and PKC epsilon, and in some populations and for some cancers, the role of viral sequences, the inventor designed adapted pharmacodiagnostic biochips with a novel choice of transcription  factor  and  peptides  from  different<br>
<br>
complexes. This set of biomolecules is specific to the invention, as well as their corresponding polynucleotides. This specific set of proteins or genes involved in the metabolic equilibrium according to their expression level and affecting cell proliferation constitutes the interest of the fabrication of pharmacodiagnostic biochips suited to any type of cancer independent of the technique of support and the protein/protein or protein/gene or protein/antibody interaction used.<br>
LIV21<br>
The present invention therefore concerns the LIV21 complex and its nucleotide sequences which can also be used as siRNA for therapeutical applications and also the Liv21 protein and derivatives and fragments thereof.<br>
The LIV21 protein is a protein which depending on the alternative splicing that it undergoes, it exists as at least three forms of different sizes (Figure 7). Moreover, it can be phosphorylated or sumoylated. It has an apparent molecular weight of between 50 kD and 51 kD in Western blotting analysis.<br>
It can be found as a dimer of a molecular weight higher that 10 0 kDa.<br>
This protein has been characterized by mass spectrometry (Maldi) (Example 1; Figures 1, 2, 3) . It gives more than 54 peptides following digestion with Promega trypsin (Figure 7) . The characteristics of the LIV21 protein are also described in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4. 55 specific peptides of LIV21 have been characterized: the LIV21a peptide (SEQ ID No 1) , the LIV21b peptide (SEQ ID No 2), and from SEQN°1 to 55 and to 110.<br>

/For the purposes of the invention, a preferred LIV21 [protein comprises at least one sequence chosen from SEQ .ID Nos  1-110  or  a  sequence  having  70%,  80%  or preferably 90%  homology with said sequence.<br>
The LIV21 complex comprises proteins including 3D helices structures, which have a major functional role for their interactions with the rest of the Liv21 complex.<br>
The present invention concerns a purified or recombinant, isolated human polypeptide having a sequence comprising the sequence SEQ ID No 1 and/or SEQ ID No 2 and/or SEQ ID No 3 and/or SEQ ID No 4 and/or SEQ ID No 5. Preferably,, the polypeptide LIV21F comprises the sequences SEQ ID Nos 1, 2 and 5. In a preferred embodiment, the complex is studied based on a sequence selected among the peptide sequences obtained by MALDI (Figures 3, 4 and 5). The invention also concerns the three peptides LIV21a (SEQ ID No 1) , LIV21b (SEQ ID No 2) and LIV21e (SEQID No 5) . It also concerns peptides comprising at least 10 consecutive amino acids of human LIV21, preferably at least 20, 3 0 or 50 consecutive amino acids of LIV21 peptides (i.e. sequences list 1-120 in annexes).<br>
' The present invention also relates a polynucleotide encoding for the human protein Liv21, Liv21a and/or Liv21b, generally a polynucleotide encoding for a polypeptide according to the present invention. The polynucleotide encoding for Liv21 may be an mRNA, a cDNA or a genomic DNA. The polyt^nucleotides according to t£n present invention may be isolated from cells and more particularly from human cells or from human cDNA libraries. They can also be obtained' by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) carried out on the total DNA of the cells or else by RT-PCR carried out on the total cellular RNAs or by chemical synthesis. Probes and primers described in the present invention may be used to isolate and/or prepare a polynucleotype encoding for a protein of the Liv21 complex. It relates also a cloning or expression vector comprising such polynucleotide.<br>
Such vector may include the elements required for the expression (expression vector) and eventually for the secretion of the protein in a host cell (signal peptide<br>
<br>
of secretion). Preferably the said vectors comprise z promoter, signals of initiation and termination of translation, as well as adapted regions for transcription regulation. The vector can be a plasmid, a cosmid, a BAC, a phage, a virus, or other. The invention relates to a host cell or a non-human transgenic animal including a vector or a polynucleotide according to the present invention.<br>
The invention also concerns LIV21 derivatives of interest, which are, for example, fusion proteins in which LIV21 is fused to labelled proteins such as GFP. Moreover, the LIV21 protein can be labelled by any means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention also concerns an antibody, which binds specifically to a polypeptide according to the present invention, preferably human LIV21, or a fragment or a derivative thereof. In a specific embodiment, the antibody binds specifically to an LIV21a or LIV21b peptide.<br>
The antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal. They may be antibody fragments and derivatives having substantially the same antigenic specificity, in particular antibody fragments (for example, Fab, Fab'2, CDRs), humanized antibodies, polyfunctional antibodies, single-chain antibodies (ScFv), etc. The antibodies of the invention can be produced using conventional methods, including the immunization of an animal and the recovery of its serum (polyclonal) or of spleen cells (so as to produce hybridomas by fusion with appropriate cell lines),<br>
Said antibodies can be obtained directly from human serum or from serum of animals immunized with the proteins or the peptides according to the present invention. Methods for producing polyclonal antibodies<br>
from varied animal species including rodents (mice, rats, etc.), primates, horses, pigs, sheep, rabbits, poultry, etc., are described, for example, in Vaitukaitis et al. (Vaitukaitis, Robbins et al. 1971). The antigen is combined with an adjuvant (for example, Freund's adjuvant) and administered to an animal, typically by subcutaneous injection. Repeated injections can be carried out. Blood samples (immune serum) are collected and the immunoglobulins are separated.<br>
The present invention concerns an anti-LIV21 serum produced by immunizing an animal with a polypeptide according to the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the animal was immunized with the LIV21a and/or LIV21b peptide. In a preferred embodiment, the animal is immunized with these two peptides. For example, the peptides can be coupled to a carrier protein such as hemocyanin, and then injected into an animal, for example a rabbit, for immunization. Polyclonal antibodies were obtained using these two peptides by having immunized two rabbits and having bled one rabbit so as to have a preimmune serum.<br>
Methods for producing monoclonal antibodies from various animal species can be found, for example, in Harlow et al. (Harlow 1988) or in Kohler et al. (Kohler and Milstein 1975). These methods include the immunization of an animal with an antigen, followed by the recovery of the spleen cells, which are subsequently fused with immortalized cells, such as myeloma cells. The resulting hybridomas produce monoclonal antibodies and can be selected by limiting dilution so as to isolate the individual clones. The antibodies can also be produced by selection from combinatorial libraries of immunoglobulins, such as those disclosed, for example, in Ward et al. (Ward, Gussow et al. 1989).<br>
<br>
The invention also includes the use of the antibodies<br>
according to the invention for the detection and/or the<br>
purification of the human LIV21 protein. In particular,<br>
the LIV21- specific antibodies can be used for the<br>
detection of these proteins in a biological sample.<br>
They thus constitute a means of immunocytochemical or<br>
immunohistochemical analysis ' of LIV21 expression on<br>
tissue  sections.  Generally  for  such analyses,  the<br>
antibodies used are labelled in order to be detectable.<br>
As an alternative, the antibodies can be indirectly<br>
labelled.<br>
f»or by nticrofluidic analysis on<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies are labelled. The labels include radiolabels, enzymes, fluorescent, luminescent or chemical labels, magnetic particles, gold labelling, biotin/avidin labelling, peroxidase labelling, etc.<br>
The invention also includes a method for detecting the LIV21 protein in a biological sample, comprising a step of suitable treatment of the cells by any appropriate means which makes it possible to render the intracellular medium accessible, a step of bringing said intracellular medium thus obtained into contact with an antibody specific for the human LIV21 protein and a step of demonstrating the LIV21-antibody complex formed, by any appropriate means. In specific embodiments, the cytoplasmic and/or nuclear extracts are prepared, and these extracts are brought into contact with the antibody specific for the human LIV21 protein.<br>
Diagnosis<br>
The present invention teaches the development of the pharmaco diagnostic test, which also makes it possible to monitor the evolution of a cell proliferation. In particular, the present invention makes it possible to<br>
<br>
monitor the evolution of a cell proliferation on fresh cells or tissues, on frozen cells or tissues and on tissues processed, inter alias, with paraffin. The applications may be the diagnosis of cancer and also the monitoring of the evolution of a cell proliferation. Preferably, the cancer is selected from breast cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, a sarcoma, a leukaemia and glioblastoma, without being limited thereto.<br>
Five of these properties can be used: its passage from the cytoplasmic cellular compartment to the nuclear compartment, the property of associating with the E2F4 transcription factor in order to form a complex which inhibits the expression of the E2F1 factor, and the ability of LIV21 to translocate in the nucleus through specific inhibition of PKCs, the sumoylation of LIV21 when the latter is nuclear and integrated into PML bodies and its interaction with HDAC.<br>
The different properties of Liv21 may be exploited by any mean of optic imaging, sonic and of current spectroscopy. The predominantly cytoplasmic state of this protein in cases of cancer, compared with its nuclear location in normal cells, is a geographical and structural difference which makes it possible, without the need for a fluorescent label, to differentiate spectral profiles of the functional pattern of cancerous tissue versus normal tissue, and thus to make the diagnosis.<br>
These results show that the cytoplasmic localization of LIV21 protein complex and the nuclear localization of other proteins of this complex is an indicator of the aggressiveness and of the metastatic potential of the cancer. The detection of the LIV21 complex proteins expression indicates the presence of cancer cells, more<br>
<br>
particularly of invasive, aggressive and/or metastatic cancer cells. [These results also show that the nuclear localization of LIV21 is, ah indicator of normal quiescent cells or of Well-differentiated tissues. 1<br>
The invention concerns, moreover, methods for the diagnosis or prognosis of cancer which implement the detection of the cytoplasmic localization of a transcription factor located in the nucleus in normal cells.<br>
The present invention concerns a method for the detection of cancer cells in a biological sample from a patient, comprising the detection of the product of expression of the LIV21 gene in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm of the cells in the biological sample from said patient, localization of said product of expression of the LIV21 gene in the cytoplasm being indicative of the presence of cancer cells and localization of said product of expression of the LIV21 gene in the nucleus being indicative of the presence of noncancer cells. Preferably, localization of said product of expression of the LIV21 gene in the cytoplasm is indicative of the presence of invasive and/or metastatic cancer cells. The method preferably comprises a prior step of suitable treatment of the cells contained in the sample by any appropriate means, which makes it possible to render the intracellular medium accessible. The method optionally comprises a step of comparison with a biological sample, which does not contain cancer cells.<br>
Optionally, the method according to the invention also comprises the detection of the product of expression of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of the protein kinase C epsilon (PKCs) gene, the E2F1 gene and the E2F4 gene. The method can in particular comprise the detection of the product of expression of<br>
<br>
two of these genes or of the three genes. Moreover, at least one of the ratios LIV21/PKCe, LIV21/E2F4 and LIV21/E2F1 can be determined in the present method. This ratio can be determined in the cytoplasm and/or in the nucleus. Preferably, these ratios are determined in the nucleus. Preferably, these ratios are compared with those obtained in a normal cell.<br>
In one embodiment, the expression product of the genes is detected at the mRNA level, it being possible for the mRNA to be detected by any means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Thus, the method according to the present invention also relates to the detection of a polynucleotide encoding the human LIV21 protein or a fragment thereof, for example LIV21a and/or LIV21b. The polynucleotide encoding LIV21 may be an mRNA, a cDNA or a genomic DNA. The polynucleotides may be isolated from cells of the biological sample. They may also be obtained by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) carried out on the total DNA of the cells or else by RT PCR carried out on the total RNA of the cells or polyA RNAs.<br>
The mRNA may be detected by an RT PCR analysis. For this, the method uses a pair of primers specific for the expression product to be detected, in particular LIV21, PKCs, E2F1 or E2F4. The term "specific pair of primers" is intended to mean that at least one of the primers is specific for the expression product to be detected, i.e. that this pair of primers makes it possible to specifically amplify a fragment of the desired mRNA. Preferably, the RT PCR analysis is carried out on nuclear and/or cytoplasmic extracts of the cells contained in the sample from the patient. Optionally, the RT PCR analysis may be a quantitative<br>
<br>
analysis. A pair of primers specific for LIV21 can be prepared on the basis of the teachings of the present application. For example, the pair of primers may-comprise the primers described in the sequences listing SEQ ID Nos 3 and 4.<br>
The pairs of primers specific for PKCe, E2F1 and E2F4 are well known by those skilled in the art (Caroll JS 2000; Mundle SD 2003; Stevaux O 2002; Cheng T 2002; Opalka B 2 0 02) .<br>
The mRNA may also be detected by Northern blotting analysis. For this, the method uses a probe specific for the expression product to be detected, in particular LIV21, PKCe, E2F1 or E2F4. A probe specific for LIV21 can be prepared on the basis of the teachings of the present application. An example of a specific probe comprises the sequence SEQ ID No 5. Preferably, the Northern blotting analysis is carried out on nuclear and/or cytoplasmic extracts of the cells contained in the sample from the patient. The nucleic probe is labelled. The oligonucleotide labelling technique is well known to those skilled in the art. The labelling of the probes according to the invention can be carried out with radioactive elements or with non radioactive molecules. Among the radioactive isotopes used, mention may be made of 32P, 33P or 3H. The non radioactive entities are selected from ligands such as biotin, avidin, streptavidin or digoxigenin, haptens, dyes and luminescent agents such as radioluminescent, chemoluminescent, bioluminescent, fluorescent or phosphorescent agents. The probes specific for PKCs, E2F1 and E2F4 are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the expression product of<br>
the genes is detected at the protein level. Preferably,<br>
the protein  is detected using a specific antibody.<br>
Thus, the method comprises a step of bringing the cells of the<br>
<br>
Antibody against each protein or peptide of Liv 21 complex.<br>
The antibodies may be monoclonal or polyclonal. The anti-LIV21F antibody can, for example, be an anti-LIV21F serum. The anti-histone antibody can be a monoclonal antibody. For the antibodies directed for example against transcription factors or the translocases, the use of such antibodies as drugs inhibiting signal transduction will be conducted systematically after having examined the expression profile of the cDNA or antibody and/or protein biochip. Chimera antibodies are also part of this application (i.e. for example the fusion protein PML/RAR, chromosome 15/17). Depending on the expression level of proteins or genes of each individual having a tumor, we will have to adjust the posology of administration of one or more antibodies, siRNA and/or chemical treatments known by those skilled in the art and already used in this type of pathologies at this evolution stage. At early stages this relates to a pharmacogenomic treatment, meaning that it would be the most suitable on the individual scale as a function of the expression pattern of each gene and protein of interest and of its expression level in its cellular compartment studied for each protein of interest. This kind of approach can evolve very fast in order to monitor expression profiles common to subtypes of individuals having the same form of cancer at the same stage (the normalization needs to be studied in cohorts of patients with a well characterized phenotype versus healthy individuals). Breast cancer is one of the hardest to address by this new therapeutic method as its phenotypic heterogeneity is well known. Anticancer chemical compounds including for example IL2, interferon, kinase inhibitors or anti-mitotic drugs described in the literature do not belong to the compounds according to the invention, while the pharmaceutical compositions including them as their use<br>
in therapy are part of the present invention.<br>
When the product of expression of one of the genes PKCE, E2F1 and E2F4 must be detected, the method can use antibodies specific for the PKCe, E2F1 and E2F4 proteins, respectively. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against PKCs, E2F1 and E2F4 are commercially available. By way of example, mention may be made of, for PKCs, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Technology, sc-214), for E2F1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Technology, sc-860), and for E2F4, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Technology, sc-866). Preferably, the antibodies are labelled, directly or by means of a secondary antibody. The antibody labelling techniques are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the protein can be detected by Western blotting analysis. The Western blotting analysis can be carried out on nuclear and/or cytoplasmic extracts of the cells contained in the sample from the patient. Briefly, the proteins are migrated in a gel and then blotted onto a membrane. This membrane is then incubated in the presence of the antibodies and the binding of the antibodies is optionally revealed using labelled secondary antibodies.<br>
In another embodiment, the protein is detected by immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry or immuno-radiography. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. The immunocytochemical analysis can be carried out on whole cells originating from the sample or which are derived there from, for example by cell culture. It can also be carried out on isolated nuclei. The immunohistochemical analysis can be carried out on mammary tissue sections.<br>
<br>
By way of illustration, an immunocytochemical analysis can include the following steps. However, it is understood that other preparatory methods can be carried out. Cells originating from the biological sample are cultured, preferably on slides (Lab Tek, Nunc, Germany) , and then washed with buffer and fixed with paraformaldehyde (for example, 4%) . A saturation step is preferably carried out by incubating the cells with buffer S (PBS-0.1% Triton X100 - 10% FCS) . The cells are then incubated with a primary antibody and are then washed and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody, if necessary. The nuclei can be labeled with propidium iodide (Sigma). The slides are mounted in moviol for observation by fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, isolated nuclei sampled during a nuclear extraction can be fixed with paraformaldehyde (for example, 4%). The suspensions of nuclei are deposited between a slide and cover slip and the observation is carried out by fluorescence microscopy and by confocal microscopy. The primary antibodies are, for example, rabbit antibodies and the secondary antibodies are labelled antibodies directed against rabbit IgGs.<br>
The biological samples originate from a patient potentially suffering from cancer or for whom it has been established that said patient is suffering from cancer. "Biological sample" is intended in particular to mean a sample of the biological fluid, living tissue, tissue fragment, mucosity, organ or organ fragment type, or any culture supernatant obtained by means of taking a sample. The method according to the present invention can comprise a step of taking a biological sample from the patient. The detection step can be carried out directly on a tissue section of the sample, or on a culture of cells originating from the sample, or on total cell extracts, nuclear extracts and/or cytoplasmic extracts.<br>

In a specific embodiment of the method comprising the detection of the product of expression of the PKCs gene, a significant increase in PKCs is indicative of the presence of cancer cells. More specifically, the amount of PKCs in normal cells is compared with the amount of PKCs in the cells of the sample, and the significant increase is determined by means of this comparison.

This E2F1/LIV21 ratio increases in the nuclear fraction of cancer cells compared with normal cells.<br>
The method according to the present invention allows in particular the detection of metastasized cancer, therapeutic monitoring and/or recurrences following treatment and makes it possible to determine the degree of invasiveness of a cancer. The specificity of the detection can be related to the crossing over of information obtained through the existence and the topography of LIV21 by all imaging and spectroscopy means and obtained by combination with other known cancerological indicators via protein arrays or microarrays. Thus, the detection based on LIV21 can be combined with the detection of other cancer markers, in particular breast cancer markers, known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In fact, the present invention concerns a method for the therapeutic monitoring of an anticancer treatment in a patient suffering from cancer, comprising the administration of the anticancer treatment to said patient and the detection of cancer cells in a biological sample from the patient, according to the method of the present invention. A decrease in cancer cells will be indicative of the effectiveness of the treatment. The detection of cancer cells in a biological sample from the patient, according to the method of the present invention,  can be carried out<br>
once or several times over the course of the anticancer treatment or after the anticancer treatment. Preferably, the biological sample originates from the tissue affected by the cancer treated.<br>
Moreover, the present invention also concerns a method for the detection of recurrences subsequent to an anticancer treatment of a cancer in a patient, comprising the detection of cancer cells in a biological sample from the patient, according to the method of the present invention.

The detection of cancer cells is indicative of recurrences. Preferably, the biological sample originates from the tissue affected by the cancer treated.<br>
The present invention also describes a kit for carrying out a method according to the invention. More particularly, the invention concerns a kit for the detection of cancer cells in a biological sample from a patient, comprising,, one or more elements selected from the group consisting of an antibody which binds specifically to human LIV21 according to the present invention and an anti-LIV21 serum according to the present invention,an oligonucleotide probe specific for the LIV21 mRNA and a pair of primers specific for the LIV21 mRNA. In a preferred embodiment, the kit comprises antibodies, which bind specifically to human LIV21. In another preferred embodiment, the kit comprises an oligonucleotide probe specific for the LIV21 mRNA. It may also comprise a probe specific for a "housekeeping" gene.<br>

<br>
Optionally, the kit according to the present invention also comprises means for detecting the product of expression of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of the protein kinase C epsilon (PKCs) gene, the E2F1 gene and the E2F4 gene.

The present invention also relates to a diagnostic composition comprising one or more elements selected from the group consisting of an antibody according to the present invention and a serum according to the present invention, an oligonucleotide probe specific for the LIV21 mRNA and a pair of primers specific for the LIV21 mRNA.<br>
Anticancer therapy<br>
In the context of an anticancer therapy, it is possible to envision increasing the amount of LIV21 present in the nucleus. For this, the nuclear localization in cancer cells of LIV21 expression could be promoted. Liv21 being able to translocate in the nucleus by itself, one could envisage the construction of an expression vector including a polynucleotide coding for human Liv21 in order to over express these protein in the cell nucleus for that we wish regulate the proliferation.<br>
The expression vector encoding Human Liv21 can be administrate in vivo to the patient by any mean known by those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, the expression vector can be administrated as naked DNA (for example EP 465 529). The microinjection, electroporation, phosphate of calcium precipitation   techniques   and   formulations   using<br>
<br>
nanocapsules or liposomes are other techniques available.<br>
The expression vector may also be in the form of a recombinant virus, including', a polynucleotide encoding human Liv21 inserted into its genome.<br>
The viral vector can be selected for example from an adenovirus, a retrovirus, in particular a lentivirus, and a virus adeno- Associated (AAV), a herpes virus (HSV), a cytomegalovirus (CMV), a vaccine virus, etc... So advantageous, the recombinant virus is a defective virus.<br>
Preferably, the expression vector permits a cellular targeting. So this vector could target cancer cells or a particular cell type that is affected by cancer. Targeting of particular cellular type can be realized by placing the polynucleotide coding Liv21 under the control of a promoter tissue-specific. In another alternative the expression vector may be targeted, for example, in association with a specific molecule of a particular tissue or cancer cells, for example a specific antibody to a molecule expressed specifically by the particular tissue or the cells of cancer. Also the choice of expression vector may also influence the cellular targeting. Indeed, if the vector is a virus, the virus tropism natural or amended may also allow a certain target.<br>
The present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a polynucleotide encoding for Liv21, more particularly an expression vector coding for Liv21. It also concerns the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a polynucleotide encoding for Liv21, in particular an expression vector encoding for Liv21 as medicament. Preferably, the present invention-concerns the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a polynucleotide encoding for Liv21, in particular an expression vector encoding for Liv21, for<br>
<br>
the preparation of a medicament for use in treating cancer. Finally, it concerns a method for treating cancer in a patient, comprising the administration to the cancer cells of a polynucleotide encoding for Liv2l, Liv21 expression making it possible to reduce or abolish the cancerous phenotype of the treated cells. Preferably, cancer is selected from breast cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, a glioblastoma, without being limited thereto.<br>
For this, the nuclear localization of LIV21 could be promoted, for example by decreasing the activity of PKCs in the cancer cells and by using HDAC inhibitors.<br>
In another specific embodiment of anticancer therapy, it is possible to envision decreasing the activity of PKCe in the cancer cells. This decrease in activity can be produced by decreasing the activity of the PKCe protein or by decreasing its expression. A decrease in the activity of the PKCe protein can be obtained by administering PKCs-protein inhibitors to the cancer cells. The PKCs-protein inhibitors are well known to those skilled in the art. A decrease in the expression of the PKCs protein can be obtained by using antisenses or siRNA specific for the PKCs gene. Kits are commercially available. Moreover, the techniques concerning inhibition by means of antisense or siRNA are well known to those skilled in the art (Arya R 2004, Lee W 2004, Sen A 2004, Platet N 1998, Hughes 1987) .<br>
The present invention therefore concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a PKCs-protein inhibitor. It also concerns the use of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a PKCs-protein inhibitor as a medicament, in particular for the preparation of a medicament  for use in treating cancer.  Finally,  it<br>
<br>
concerns a method for treating cancer in a patient, comprising the administration to the cancer cells of a PKCe-protein  inhibitor,  the  pKCs-protein  inhibitor making it possible to reduce or abolish the cancerous phenotype of the treated cells. In a first embodiment, the PKCe-protein inhibitor decreases the activity of the PKCe protein.  In a second embodiment,  the PKCe-protein inhibitor decreases the expression of the PKCe protein.  Preferably,  cancer is selected from breast cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer,  lung cancer, skin  cancer,  prostate  cancer,  colon cancer,  liver cancer,  a  sarcoma,  a  leukaemia  and  glioblastoma, without being limited thereto. PKC epsilon inhibitors are published and commercially available for other<br>
applications. *Applications.For that, the Liv21 expression could be decreases blocked in nuclear of the diseased cells of neurodegeneration.<br>
In the context of a therapy for a neurodegenerative<br>
disease, it is possible to envision decreasing the amount of LIV21 present in the nucleus.% The cells affected by the neurodegenerative disease are generally neurons, motorneurons, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the neurodegenerative disease is chosen from Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The inhibition or the blocking of LIV21 expression can be carried out by any means known to those skilled in the art. In particular, by way of illustration, mention may be made of the antisense strategy, siRNA and ribozymes. Thus, an antisense oligonucleotide or an expression vector encoding this antisense oligonucleotide could be prepared and used to block the translation of the mRNA encoding LIV21 in vivo. Moreover, a ribozyme can be prepared for cleaving and destroying, in vivo, the mRNA encoding LIV21. It is also possible to envisage a triple-helix strategy in which an oligonucleotide is designed so as to hybridize with the gene encoding LIV21 and to thus block the transcription of this gene.<br>
<br>
For this, the nuclear localization of LIV21 could also be hindered, for example by increasing the activity of PKCs in the cells affected by the neurodegenerative disease.<br>
In one particular therapeutic method against neurodegenerative diseases, it is possible to envision increasing PKC epsilon activity in the cells affected by the neurodegenerative disease. This increase in activity can be produced by increasing the activity of the PKCs protein or by increasing its expression. An increase in the activity of the PKCs protein can be obtained by administering PKCs-protein activators to the cells affected by the neurodegenerative disease. The PKCs-protein activators are well known to those skilled in the art (Toma 0 (2004), Activation of PKCs by DAG, AGPI: oleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, etc. Activation and proteolysis of PKCs in gonadotropic cells: Communication 2004 by Macciano H, Junoy B, Mas JL, Drouva SV, UMR6544 Marseille) . An increase in the expression of the PKCs protein can be obtained by using expression vectors encoding the PKCs protein and which make it possible to overexpress it in the cells affected by the neurodegenerative disease.<br>
Thus, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a PKCs-protein activator or an expression vector encoding the PKCs protein. It also concerns the use of a PKCs-protein activator or of an expression vector encoding the PKCs protein, for the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment of a neurodegenerative disease <br>
Screening method<br>
The  invention  concerns  methods	for  the  selection,<br>
identification,  characterization	or  optimization  of<br>
active compounds,  which decrease	cell proliferation,<br>
<br>
based on the measurement of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of LIV21, or of the binding of the LIV21 protein to the E2F4 protein.<br>
In a first embodiment, the selection, the identification, the characterization or the optimization of active compounds of therapeutic interest comprises bringing a candidate compound into contact with a cell and determining the nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of the LIV21 expression product. An increase in the nuclear localization of LIV21 indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of decreasing or abolishing cell proliferation. A decrease in the nuclear localization of LIV21 indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of treating or preventing a neurodegenerative disease.<br>
In a second embodiment, the selection, the identification, the characterization or the optimization of active compounds of therapeutic interest comprises bringing a candidate compound into contact with a cell and determining the level of expression of the gene encoding the PKCe protein. A decrease in the expression of PKCE indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of decreasing or abolishing cell proliferation. An increase in the expression of PKCs indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of treating or preventing a neurodegenerative disease.<br>
In a third embodiment, the selection, the identification, the characterization or the optimization of<br>
active compounds of therapeutic interest comprises bringing a candidate compound into contact with a cell and determining the level of LIV21/E2F4 complex. An increase in the level of LIV21/E2F4 complex indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of decreasing or abolishing cell proliferation. A decrease<br>
<br>
in the level of LIV21/E2F4 complex indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of treating or preventing a neurodegenerative disease.<br>
In a fourth embodiment, the selection, the identification, the characterization or the optimization of active compounds of therapeutic interest comprises bringing a candidate compound into contact with a cell and determining the level of expression of the gene encoding the E2F1 protein. A decrease in the expression of E2F1 indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of decreasing or abolishing cell proliferation. An increase in the expression of E2F1 indicates that the candidate compound is active in terms of treating or preventing a neurodegenerative disease.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of screening for a compound capable of interacting in vitro, directly or indirectly, with LIV21, characterized in that: in a first step, the candidate compound and LIV21 are brought into contact and, in a second step, the complex formed between said candidate compound and LIV21 is detected by any appropriate means.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of screening for a compound capable of modulating (activating or inhibiting) the activity of the LIV21 protein, characterized in that: in a first step, cells of a biological sample expressing the LIV21 protein are brought into contact with a candidate compound, in a second step, the effect of said candidate compound on the activitv of said LIV21 protein is measured by anv appropriate means, and in a third step, candidate compounds capable of modulating said activity are selected. The activity of LIV21 can, for example, be estimated by means of evaluating the ability of the cell to divide, by measuring the expression of the E2F1<br>
<br>
gene or by the cytoplasmic and/or nuclear localization of LIV21.<br>
The candidate compound can be a protein, a	peptide, a<br>
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) , a lipid, or an	organic or<br>
inorganic  compound.  In  particular,  the	candidate<br>
compound could be an antibody, an antisense,	a ribozyme<br>
or an siRNA.<br>

The MCF-7 line is a non clonal human line of breast<br>

phenotype which is characterized by the appearance of<br>

In vivo, these cells are relatively non metastatic and<br>
<br>
this low invasiveness is thought to be due to a low constitutive activity of the protein kinases C (PKCs) and to a relatively low level of expression of protein kinase C alpha.<br>

These studies use appropriate drugs, such as TNF for the induction of apoptosis, or TPA (12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-SUMOate) for the induction of differentiation and therefore for the study of departure from the cell cycle.

PCRs carried out using templates from PCRs performed with the primers Al + oligo dT on the RTs carried out at 45°C on the total RNA and the poly A+ RNA (messenger RNA). The primers used for these PCRs are Al + GDBRl or Al + Splicing reverse.<br>
On the RTs carried out using the total RNA, a band of 1178 1253 bp is amplified with, the primers Al + GDBRl and Al + Splicing reverse. The poly A RNA was used to carry out the RT and is weakly observed at the size (Figure 10) of 1400 bp for amplification with the primers Al + G, and of 415 bp with the primers Al + Splicing reverse. In the Al + splicing PCR product, there are other bands, of 8 60 and 233 bp (Figure 11).<br>
Gel 3:<br>
PCRs carried out using templates from PCRs performed with the primers Al + oligo dT on the RTs carried out at 45°C on the total RNA and the poly A+ RNA (messenger RNA). The primers used for these PCRs are Al + GDBRl or Al + Splicing reverse (Figurel2).<br>
For the PCRs carried out on RTs performed at 55°C, the same overall pattern of bands as that obtained on the RTs performed at 45°C is found.<br>
No specific amplification is observed when the poly A RNA was used to carry out the RT. On the RTs carried out on the total RNA, a major band of 1554 1609 bp is found with the primers Al + GDBRl and Al + Splicing reverse. A band at the theoretical size of -1455 bp is expected for an amplification with the primers Al + GDBRl and a band with the theoretical size of<br>
<br>
415 bp is expected with the primers Al + Splicing reverse. In the 2 profiles, very clear bands of 1900 -2100 bp and of 1000 -1300 bp are found, but with a weaker intensity than that of the band of 1500 1600 bp.<br>
In the Al + splicing reverse PCR product, there is another major band, of 263 bp.<br>
Gel 4:<br>
Nested PCRs carried out using templates from PCRs performed with the primers Al + GDBR1 or Al + Splicing reverse on the RTs carried out at 45°C on the total RNA and the poly A+ RNA (messenger RNA). The primers used for these PCRs are ATG + GDBR1 or ATG + Splicing reverse (Figure 13).<br>
The nested PCRs carried out with the primers<br>
ATG + GDBR1 give bands at 1213 bp (RT 45°C) and 1559<br>
+ 1315 bp (RT at 55°C); the expected theoretical size<br>
is 1455 bp. The PCRs carried with the primers<br>
ATG + Splice reverse give more varied band profiles.<br>
These PCRs carried out on other PCRs performed with the primers Al + GDBR1 or Al + Splicing reverse.<br>
The presence of a band of 400 bp is noted in the profiles obtained from messenger RNA (the band obtained from the reverse transcription carried out at 55°C is of greater intensity).<br>
The profiles of the ATG + Splice reverse PCRs carried with total RNA at the start give a band of 424 43 7 bp of very strong intensity. Bands of 614 and 783 bp of very strong intensity are also found in the profile of the RT 45 and a greater number of bands, but of weaker intensity, is found in the profile of the RT 55, bands at 1118, 936 and 749 bp.<br>

The  screening with Eco RI   shows that,   out  of  the  13 clones screened,   7 have inserts of sizes between 239 and 63 7  bp. The  clones  G45T5    (148  bp),   S45T9    (410  bp),   S45T3<br>
(100  bp),   S55M1   (491  bp),   S55T6   (251 bp)   and S55T9<br>
(637  bp)   were  extracted so as  to be  sequenced.<br>
Primers used for determining the sequences of  the<br>
various  clones:<br>
(SEQUANCE REMOVED)<br>
<br>
Results:<br>
Clone B2, the band which is approximately 400 bp is the same fragment as S55M1, which itself is the same fragment as S45T9. These fragments are approximately between 400 and 450 bp. This is not surprising since they were obtained after a nested PCR carried out with the splicing reverse primer and the Al primer (for the B2 fragment) and the ATG galgal primer for the S45T9 and S55M1 fragments. These fragments were obtained with RTs carried out at various temperatures. On the other<br>
<br>
hand, the S55T9 fragment is nevertheless approximately 600 bp, and a part (300 bp) exhibits quite strong identity with the other fragments cloned.<br>
EXAMPLE 6:  From the cloning of the LIV21 gene described above, the new sequences are studied in order to design the most specific and effective siRNAs (ie. listing of siRNAs and figure 19) for creating "silencing" of the gene, i.e. inhibiting its expression. In the knowledge that the effect of the inhibition at each injection of siRNA remains short, i.e. most commonly less than one hour, the inventor has developed diagnostic products and therapeutic products from this same tool, namely the siRNA.<br>
EXAMPLE 6.1:  The inventor uses siRNAs labelled with rhodamine or fluorescein or any other label that can be revealed and followed by optical observation with a microscope in order to localize the site, in the cells, tissues or sample labelled, that the labelled siRNA will go to in order to attach to the specific sequence which characterizes it, and thus to indicate the site of the expression of the messenger RNA of the gene of interest. Thus, the specific siRNA can be used as a diagnostic marker as an antibody would be, and can make it possible to localize, in a specific case such as on extemporaneous samples or any other type of sample taken from a patient, for example a cancerous tissue sample, the fluorescence or any other labelling used on the siRNA and found in a cell compartment on the sample.<br>
Thus, a labelled siRNA of LIV21 (Figure 19) that is found, under a microscope, in the cell nuclei at the periphery of a surgical exeresis, would indicate a diagnosis of complete exeresis of the cancerous tissue; on the other hand, this same marker found in the cytoplasm or the membranes of this same sample would mean that the surgeon would have to perform an enlarged<br>
exeresis, immediately if this test can be carried out directly in the operating theatre, which would be the best situation for removing all the cancer cells visible only on this molecular and cellular scale by virtue is the siRNA marker. This could be a more rapid implementation alternative than the other application that the inventor has developed with the antibody or the LIV21 peptide, which can be used in the same manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 6.2 : for therapeutic products , the inventor uses first labelled siRNAs of the Liv21 complex in order to evidence their expected presence in the cellular compartment and to visualize them. Then the inventor will use non-labelled Liv21 siRNAs solely for their therapeutic role. In a specific case, the injection of siRNA (Figure 19) directly in a neurodegenerating tissue or any other mean of administration allowing to the siRNA to get to the neurodegenerating tissue (for example the ear, the eye, cephalorachidian liquid, etc..) and to act allowing proliferation until apoptosis and therefore the death of the neurodegeneraing cell.<br>
EXAMPLE 7: pharmaco-diagnostic test<br>
Based on the observations that follow in annex at the end of the description of the example concerning the properties of the Liv21 complex, the inventor conceived a design for a pharmacodiagnostic test clinically applicable by known technologically means, which can differ according to users and correspond for each mean to a new product. The invention consists in the fabrication of diagnostic DNA, protein and antibody arrays, including the antibodies already known for the different proteins of the complex associated with Liv21 according to the phase of the cell cycle, that is the antibodies, peptides or nucleotide sequences of the following genes:  RBP2,  E2F4,  E2F1,  SUMO,  INT2,  CRB2,<br>
<br>
HDAC1, TGFbeta, integrin_alpha5 beta2, Myob, MyoD, cycE/cdk2, cdkl, chkl, chk2, TNFalpha, CREB1 and p300, Rb, pl07, pl30 from the pocket protein family. But also NFkB, cdc2A, mdm2, p21, p53, p65, RAS, Ki67, CAF1. The protein arrays (Figure 20) will allow the study of over or under expression of the gene products, the protein interactions and the post-translational modifications, more particularly phosphorylations and methylations of certain proteins, which indicate a specific state of the unhealthy cell that is different form the protein interactions and the metabolism of an healthy cell. The expression and silencing state of certain genes is different. The combined analysis of the results of over and under expression of the DNA and protein arrays will allow the best therapeutic targeting.<br>
Example 7.1: pharmacodiagnostic biochip {figure 20) conceived based on nucleotide or peptide sequences fixed on classical supports and according to known techniques such as Agilent or Affymetrix or Caliper without restriction thereof and corresponding to known sequences of following genes and proteins listed in the patent, preferably using sequences that, by 3D analysis, show preferably a loop or helix-loop-helix or basic loop or zinc finger 3D structure or a 3D conformation similar to an helix corresponding in most cases to functional sites, or nucleotide sequences corresponding to a region of cystein methylation, tnethylation of the promoter region of the gene inducing a potential silencing (see general bibliography) , as well as new sequences of Liv21 listed in the description and in annex, but also sequences common to certain genes and certain virus thought to be implicated in particular in breast cancer of Chinese population: Mdm2 and HIV1<br>

These sequences may be tested by microfluidic techniques upon fixation on a gold coverslip in order to study the protein interactions with the cell extracts of the patient.<br>
Example 7.2: microfluidic test, for example Biacore, using the SPR technique known by those skilled in the art based on a support fixed with a gold film, which allows, once the light beam has been sent to the interface, to obtain an adsorbed energy as a function of the presence and the size of protein complexes (in the case of protein protein or protein antibody interactions) or of protein DNA complexes (in the case of protein DNA interactions) or of protein peptide complexes and an evanescent wave perpendicular to the interface axis. The inventor fixes the selected peptide or DNA sequences on gold particles and calculates the rU number as a function of the size of molecules cited in this patent for each interaction complex studied. In microfluidic, the liquid flowing over these gold film arrays may be a cell extract (or a selective one, meaning that it is only made of cell nuclei, or solely cell cytoplasms or solely cytoskeletal proteins etc..) according to extraction, separation and fractionation techniques such as Calbiochem: subcellular proteome extraction or tissue or cell extracts without any other preparation than anti-proteases or serum issued from a patient sample in order to study the circling marker (i.e. described nucleotide or peptide sequence list and/or known sequences of genes involved in the proliferation cycle listed).<br>
EXAMPLE 8: Study of the expression of LIV21 in breast cancer biopsies and Colon cancer biopsies<br>
<br>
In order to determine whether the observations obtained above are applicable to human tissues, a large number of _ . cancer biopsies obtained from patients were studied by immunohistochemical reaction with LIV21-comple* specific antibodies. The immunohistochemical determination of LIV21 protein expression was carried out on several biopsies from patients. Moreover, some paraffin slides from patients suffering from bladder cancer and from breast cancer were also studied.<br>
Immunocytochemical analysis protocol: Deparaffinize the slides. Rehydrate the tissues.<br>
Saturate the nonspecific sites and permeabilize the membranes.<br>
Add the antibody in a humid chamber. Reveal the antibody.<br>
Deparaffinize the slides under a hood.<br>
Two successive baths of toluene (rectapur Prolabo) 2x30 min or 2x20 min; then dehydrate the tissues with rectapur alcohol at 100% for 15 min; then rectapur ethanol at 95% for 10 min; then rectapur 70% for a further 10 min.<br>
Thaw the antibody at the same time.<br>
Rehydrate the tissues gently in PBS supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Triton.<br>
Saturate  the  nonspecific  sites  (for  example,  with ovalbumin) and permeabilize the membranes. Rehydrate for one hour.<br>
Deposit one ml of this "PBS" per section in order to cover the slide without it drying out at any moment (when it is a slide with cells and not tissues, half an hour is sufficient).<br>
Place the pane and the stainless steel cover and water below so as to create a humid chamber. Add the antibody in the humid chamber.<br>
Dilute the rabbit serum to 1/200 in 4 ml of PBS triton, so as to continue to permeabilize the membranes, and<br>
<br>
FCS.<br>
Place 1 ml on each slide and keep away from the light<br>
and avoid evaporation. Leave overnight or for a minimum<br>
of three hours.<br>
Then rinse with IX normal PBS pH 7,  carry out two<br>
washes of 5 to 10 min so that no trace of the first<br>
antibody remains.<br>
While preparing the Alexa 488 green probe (in the cold<br>
at 4° and in the dark) diluted' to 1/250,  therefore<br>
10 µliter in 2.5 ml of PBS, still with 10% FCS and 0.1%<br>
Triton, rest the slides on the plate. Cover the section<br>
again with 2.5 ml in order to maintain a humid chamber<br>
for one hour, and then wash with IX PBS, pH 7.<br>
Wash  with  propidium  iodide  at  0.5  microgram  per<br>
microliter to be diluted to 2 0 microgram per ml and<br>
then again to 1/50, but this time, diluted in IX PBS<br>
alone (50 microliters per 2.5 ml of PBS). Drain while<br>
taking them out of the PBS and then dispense 2.5 ml of<br>
propidium iodide over the four slides for one minute,<br>
followed by two rinses with simple  PBS.  Mount the<br>
slides in Moviol before reading.<br>
For an immunolabelling with peroxidase it is mandatory<br>
to mask the antigenic sites by a 20 minutes water bath<br>
step in order to obtain meaningful results when one is<br>
working with paraffined coverslips.<br>
All the results are summarised in Table 1 below.<br>
Figure 23: Expression of Liv21 protein defined by immunohisto Chemical in biopsy of cancer colon and biopsy of health tissus<br>
These results show that the cytoplasmic localization of LIV21 is an indicator of the aggressiveness and of the metastatic potential of the cancer. The detection of LIV21 expression indicates the presence of invasive, aggressive and metastatic cancer cells. These results also show that the nuclear localization of LIV21 is an indicator of normal quiescent cells, that is of well-differentiated tissues.<br>
Annex: Study of the nuclear translocation of LIV21 in MCF-7 cells<br>
The study of the subcellular distribution of LIV21 in different tumor lines of various origins showed an exclusively cytoplasmic localization of this protein.<br>
The presence of putative phosphorylation sites by<br>
protein kinases C (PKCs) in the Liv21 sequence directed<br>
the	study toward a	involvement of<br>
these proteins with respect to its nuclear translocation. The MCF-7 line treated with TPA modulates PKCs and is used in the present study.<br>
The effect of TPA on the MCF-7 line<br>
TPA is a known activator of PKCs. It activates the growth of normal breast cells, does not modify the proliferation of the cells of benign tumors from this same tissue, but drastically inhibits the proliferation of the cells of human mammary tumor lines such as the MCF-7 line. It reduces the cell growth of this line by positively controlling the c-erb-2 receptor and negatively controlling the retinoic acid receptor a, which are both expressed in particularly large amount in these cells. The TPA greatly and rapidly inhibits the expression and the function of estrogen receptors (ERs) and it induces the time- and dose-dependent translocation of protein kinases C (PKCs) from the cytosol to the membranes.<br>
Furthermore, TPA increases the migratory capacity of MCF-7 cells in vitro and a short period of treatment of<br>
these cells with TPA. induces cellular expansion and microtubule organization characteristic of their differentiation.<br>
Expression of LIV21 in MCF-7 cells<br>
Firstly, the inventor verified the expression of LIV21 in these cells at the transcriptional level and at the protein level.<br>
The expression of the LIV21 mRNA was demonstrated by RT PCR (sense primer: (CCTGACATCCCTACATCACCCAT) (SEQ ID No 3) and antisense primer: TCCTATGCTTGACTATTGC(SEQ ID No 4) in these cells compared with the cells from breast tissues (Figure 2A). An mRNA of the same size as the mRNA detected in the breast tissues and specific for LIV21 was detected. However, the level of expression of LIV21 in the MCF 7 cells is lower than in the breast tissues. This first result shows that the MCF 7 line expresses the LIV21 mRNA.<br>
The inventor tackled the study of the expression of the LIV21 protein through the Western blotting technique, with an anti-LIV21 antibody, in MCF-7 cells compared with mammary tissues.<br>
The anti-LIV21 antibodies were obtained by the method described below. In this line, LIV21 is expressed, both in the mammary tissues and in the MCF-7 cells, in the form of a doublet which migrates at an apparent molecular weight of 50 kDa.<br>
Production of purified anti-LIV21 serum<br>
The specific peptide sequences are the sequences No. 1<br>
and No. 2.<br>
These peptides were injected into rabbits (NZ W ESD<br>
75 female, 2.3 kg at day 0), in agreement with standard<br>
immunization procedures, such as:<br>
The effect of TPA in MCF-7 cells<br>
It has been described in the literature that TPA induces the arrest of proliferation and the differentiation of tumor cells of the MCF-7 line. After three days of treatment, the control cultures have twice as many cells as the treated cultures. TPA at a<br>
 <br>
concentration of 25 nM therefore clearly inhibits the proliferation.<br>
In parallel, the TPA-treated cells rapidly acquire characteristics of differentiated mammary gland cells: hypertrophy, membrane protrusions and tendency to dissociate from one another. However, in the period of time over which the cells were studied, the secretory phenotype (appearance of granules and of secretory canaliculi) was not observed.<br>
The effect of TPA on the Liv21 nuclear localization<br>
The expression of Liv21 in nuclear extracts studied and<br>
prepared after 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h of TPA treatment.<br>
During<br>
These kinetics, maximum anti-Liv21 immunoreactivity was<br>
observed from 12h, was maintened up to 48h and returned<br>
to its initial intensity after 72h of treatment.<br>
The immunoreactivity of Liv21 significantly increases<br>
at 12h, at which time the number of cells in the S<br>
phase is minimal. It lasts until the reinitiation of<br>
the cell cycle observed at 72h.<br>
The results of the immunocytochemical study carried out<br>
using an anti-Liv21 antibody show that the nuclear<br>
translocation of Liv21 is at a maximum at 12h and the<br>
localization of Liv21 is predominantly cytoplasmic at<br>
72h, which is in agreement with the Western blotting<br>
observations. However, it is interesting to note that<br>
the expression of Liv21 already begins from lh of<br>
treatment  in  certain  cells,  since  they  are  not<br>
synchronous.<br>
All these observations show that the nuclear translocation of Liv21 is concurrent with the decrease in the number of cells in the S phase.<br>
<br>
Study  of  the  influence  of  PKCs  on  the  nuclear translocation of LIV21 Effect of TPA on PKCe expression<br>
Western blotting study: Given that the protein sequence of LIV21 has putative PKC phosphorylation sites, including two specific for PKCe, the inventor tested the variation in the expression of this PKC as a function of the duration of TPA treatment. It was observed that TPA acts very rapidly on PKCe expression, which decreases from 3 0 min. The expression of PKCzeta (PKC£) is used as an internal control since it is not sensitive to TPA.<br>
The effect of the selective inhibition of the activity of PKCe on the nuclear translocation of LIV21 was studied by immunocytochemistry. These experiments were carried out on nontreated cultures or cultures treated for 12 h with TPA at 25 nM or with the peptide at two different concentrations, 1 and 2 \M. The peptide used at the concentration of 2 |iM has an effect identical to that of TPA on the nuclear translocation of LIV21.<br>
These results were supported by cell fractionation experiments on cultures treated with the PKCe-inhibiting peptide at 2 µM, compared with TPA-treated cultures. The same LIV21 expression profile was observed in the form of a doublet in the cytoplasm and of a single band in the nuclear fraction.<br>
Exemple: Western blotting analysis<br>
This  example  describes  the  conditions  used  for  a<br>
Western blotting analysis of cancerous breast cells.<br>
The protein extracts are heated at 80°C for 5 minutes in a Laemmli buffer (pH 7.4, 0.06 M Tris, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, ß-mercaptoethanol). The migration is carried out by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) . 10 to 20 µg of proteins migrate in a 12% polyacrylamide gel for 1 h<br>
<br>
under denaturing conditions (migration buffer: 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine, 1% SDS, pH 8.3). The proteins are then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &amp; Schuell) for one hour by liquid transfer, in a transfer membrane (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3). The membranes, saturated in PBS-0.1% Tween-0.1% Triton X100-5% skimmed milk for one hour, are brought into contact with the primary antibody diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween-0.1% Triton Xl00-1% milk at ambient temperature with gentle agitation for one hour to two hours. After washing, the peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody is incubated with the membranes for 1 h. Revelation is carried out by means of a chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL. kit according to the supplier's protocol (Amersham).<br>
The primary antibodies used are:<br>
The anti-LIV21 serum which was produced using two synthetic peptides based on the sequence of LIV21: peptide LIV21a (SEQ ID No 1) and peptide LIV21b (SEQ ID No 2)and /or peptide Liv21e (SEQ ID No 51). The peptides were coupled to hemocyanin before being injected into rabbits for the immunization. The polyclonal antibody was obtained from these two peptides by having immunized two rabbits and having bled one rabbit so as to have a preimmune serum (in order to be sure that this antibody did not already exist in this rabbit).<br>
The rabbit anti-CDK2 polyclonal antibody (Santa-Cruz technology sc-163) diluted to 1/200.<br>
The mouse anti-p21 monoclonal antibody (Dako, M7202) diluted to 1/150.<br>
The  mouse  anti-p27  monoclonal  antibody  (Santa-Cruz technology sc-1641) diluted to 1/100.<br>
Antitumor role of PML bodies: At the proliferation stage, there are visualized modifications in the PML bodies since these PML bodies dissociate and degrade: (speckles),  proteins  then become  available  in  the<br>
 <br>
nucleus for ensuring transcription, proliferation, immune reactions and everything that is required for gene transcription. It has been shown that PML associates with SUMO and with HDAC-1 (histone deacetylase 1) and that its complex acts on the expression of E2F1 and PML thus acts on the arrest of proliferation by blocking E2F1. Thus, the PML/HDAC-1 complex down-regulates E2F1 expression. PML associated with Rb (pl3 0) binds to the deacetylated his tones and blocks E2F1 by binding to the chromatin.<br>
In acute promyelocytic leukemias, PML is truncated and becomes a fusion protein with the retinoic acid receptor. This fusion protein (PMLRARalpha) is due to a 15/17 chromosomal translocation. A new treatment for this disease by combining arsenic and retinoic acid in order to induce cancer cells into apoptosis has been reported in the literature. The PML protein is thought to regulate proliferation in cancers and lymphomas. The inventor has shown, by immunoprecipitation, the association SUMO-PML in which LIV21 is located.<br>
In the above patents, it was shown that LIV21 is phosphorylated by PKC£. The TPA-treated MCF-7 lines show an inhibition of cancerous proliferation and a cell differentiation, and LIV21 is translocated into the nucleus. If a PKCe-specif ic inhibitory peptide was used, it was the activity and not the expression of PKCe which was inhibited.<br>
During this TPA treatment (25 nM) , when E2F4, pl30 and LIV21 were studied (green fluorescence) in the nuclei labelled (DMA) with propidium iodide (red fluorescence), the following were observed: After 12 h, intranuclear green fluorescence signals with the same pattern for E2F4, pl30 and LIV21;<br>
<br>
After 48 h, when the proliferation begins, E2F4 has a comparable localization; but at 72 h, it disappears from the nucleus (to the benefit of E2F1).<br>
By observing, by double labelling, the colocalization of PML and of LIV21 at 24 h of TPA treatment (cf. merge: yellow fluorescence) , it was observed that they are colocalized in the nuclei. At 48 h, the colocalization between LIV21 and SUMO ie. The hypothesis is that SUMO, which binds to LIV21, in fact targets LIV21 into the PML bodies and that LIV21 is involved in the PML/SUMO/Rb/HDAC-1 complexes. LIV21 is physically associated with PML and SUMO in the nuclear bodies, by immunoprecipitation and by colocalization by immunocytochemistry (Rb, pi30 and pi07 are pocket proteins which have the same binding site). The Rb proteins repress cell growth (Fabbro, Regazzi R, Bioch Biophys Res Comm 1986 Feb 2; 135 (1): 65-73).<br>
Physical interaction of LIV21 with the proteins of the<br>
E2F family<br>
Coimmunoprecipitation  experiments  carried  out  using<br>
anti-LIV21, anti-E2Fl and anti-E2F4 antibodies made it<br>
possible to demonstrate that LIV21  associates with<br>
E2F4.<br>
The members of the E2F family are transcription factors whose role has been widely described in the literature as being key molecules in the positive or negative control of the cell cycle (Slansky JE and Farnham PJ 1996; Helin K 1998 and Yamasaki L, 1998), by virtue of their  association  with  the  pRb  protein  (Wu  CL,<br>
zukerbrg LrR,Lees JA 1995) or pocket proteins, E2F1<br>
positively controls the cell cycle by transactivating the  promoter  of  the  genes  responsible  for  cell proliferation (DNA polymerase alpha, thymidine kinase, DHFR, etc.), whereas E2F4 is described as one of the members of the EF family which negatively controls the<br>

cycle. Furthermore, a high expression of E2F1 in embryonic mammary tissues has been shown (Espanel X, Gillet G 1998}, whereas it is no longer expressed in post-mitotic mammary tissues, to the benefit of a large increase in E2F4 expression (Kastner A Brun G 1998).<br>
The identification of antigens has been carried out in cell lysates by immunoprecipitation. The analysis of the physical interaction of various proteins associated with E2F4 and E2F1 was demonstrated by coimmuno-precipitation of protein complexes. The complex was studied using \X MACS PROTEIN with MICROBEADS (MILTENYIBIOTEC). When lysates of S aureus are added, the proteins A interact with the Fc portion of the specific antibodies and the immunocomplexes become insoluble and are therefore recovered by centrifugation. After breaking of the bonds (heating) between AG/Ac and protein A-rich membranes, Western blotting was carried out. These results suggest that the LIV21/E2F4 complex appears to play an important Role in establishing cell quiescence. A study of co immunoprecd .pitatiori)is following also with the profound mammalian kit Pierc Functional interaction of LIV21 with the proteins of<br>
the E2F family<br>
It was demonstrated that blocking the expression of the LIV21 protein was correlated with a decrease in the expression of E2F4 and with an increase in the expression of E2F1. In parallel, the functional aspect of the increase in E2F1 was verified by studying the transcription of two of its target genes, DHFR and DNA polymerase a.<br>
In conclusion, these results suggest that the LIV21/E2F4 complex acts as a complex which inhibits the expression of the E2F1 gene. This complex could correspond to a new point of control in the arrest of cell proliferation.<br>
