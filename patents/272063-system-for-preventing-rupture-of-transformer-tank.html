Description SYSTEM FOR PREVENTING RUPTURE OF TRANSFORMER<br>
TANK<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to a rupture prevention system and, more particularly, to a system for preventing a transformer tank from rupturing, which increases the limit of the. deformation of a tank constituting a transformer, thus reducing the pressure generated in the transformer, and which increases the number of rapture discs installed per unit area, thus eliminating pressure. Background Art<br>
Generally, transformers are pieces of electrical equipment which change a voltage to a higher or lower voltage. The transformers are classified into oil-immersed transformers and dry-type transformers according to the kind of insulating material. An oil-immersed transformer filled with insulating oil is widely used. The oil-immersed transformer includes a high-voltage winding, a low-voltage winding, an iron core, insulating oil, a tank, and other components.<br>
The oil-immersed transformer is constructed so that electric current is supplied through a bushing mounted to a bushing turret. When a breakdown occurs in the transformer due to abnormal voltage caused by lightning or a switching surge, and thus an arc is generated, some of the insulating oil filled in the tank for insulating or cooling the transformer is instantaneously burnt. Due to the combustion of the insulating oil, the internal pressure in the transformer is suddenly increased. Such pressure ruptures the transformer tank, and air fed through the ruptured portion is supplied to an arc generating part, so that a fire may break out. Further, the insulating oil escapes out of the ruptured tank, thus causing environmental pollution.<br>
In order to prevent the tank from rapturing, the conventional method of interrupting the supply of electricity to the transformer has been widely used. However, the tank may rapture even due to the rise in pressure occurring prior to interrupting the electricity supply, and thus a device for mechanically eliminating the pressure is required. Thus, an attempt to eliminate localized pressure has been made using rapture discs. However, in the case of a large transformer, the air generating point may be far from the rupture discs. Hence, before the pressure eliminating operation using the rapture discs is conducted, the tank may rapture. Further, the number of rapture discs is not sufficient compared to the arc energy, so that the tank may rapture before the pressure eliminating operation is performed. Disclosure of Invention<br>
1<br><br>
Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art. and an object of the present invention is to provide a system for preventing the rapture of a transfomier tank wherever the arc is generated in the tank, which increases a limit of the deformation of a tank constituting a transformer, thus primarily preventing a sudden rise in pressure, and which increases the number of rupture discs installed per unit area, thus preventing the rapture of the tank. Technical Solution<br>
In order to accomplish the object, the present invention provides a system for preventing a rapture of a transformer tank, which is provided on a transformer and prevents a rupture of the transformer tank due to a sudden rise in pressure in the transformer.<br>
The system includes a support part which is installed in the transformer tank and supports a shielding plate for absorbing a magnetic field so that the shielding plate is not directly attached to the transfomier tank.<br>
A plurality of rapture discs is mounted, respectively, to a plurality of pipes extending outwards from the transformer tank, and is ruptured when pressure in the transformer tank reaches a predeterniined pressure level, thus opening passages.<br>
A plurality of relief tanks is vertically installed at a position neighboring the transformer, and is coupled to the pipes, thus providing space for storing insulating oil.<br>
Further, an oil gauge is mounted at a lower position in each of the relief tanks, and generates a signal when the insulating oil flows into the relief tank, thus informing a manager of rupture of each of the rupture discs and discharge of the insulating oil.<br>
Hereinafter, the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Herein, detailed descriptions of known functions or constructions will be omitted so that those skilled in the art can clearly understand the gist of the invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view showing the construction of a rupture prevention system, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 2 is a front view showing part of a transformer equipped with the rapture prevention system of FIG. 1, FIG. 3 is a perspective view showing the transformer equipped with the rupture prevention system of FIG. 1, FIG. 4 is a perspective view showing the state where shielding plates are installed by a support part of the present invention, and FIG. 5 is a detailed view showing portion 'A' of FIG. 4.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 to 5, a rapture prevention system according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a support part 110. rapture discs 120,<br>
2<br><br>
relief tanks 130, and oil gauges 140. Such a rupture prevention system increases the limit of deformation of a transformer tank 10 using the support part 110. and is provided with a plurality of rupture discs 120, thus efficiently preventing the transformer tank 10 from rapturing due to a sudden rise in internal pressure.<br>
The support part 110 is mounted to the inner surface of the tank 10 constituting the transformer, thus supporting shielding plates 111. Meanwhile, the shielding plates 111 are installed in the transformer tank 10 to absorb a magnetic field. In the prior art, the shielding plates 111 are directly mounted to the tank 10, thus increasing the strength of the tank 10, and reducing the limit of the deformation of the tank 10 due to the pressure. However, according to the present invention, the support part 110 is mounted to the inner surface of the tank 10 so as to prevent the shieldmg plates 111 from being directly mounted to the tank 10. The support part 110 serves to support the shielding plates 111. In a detailed description, the shielding plates 111 are welded to the front surface of the support part 110. Four corners of the support part 110 are bent backwards a predetermined length, thus providing welding parts 113. The welding parts 113 are welded to the inner wall of the transformer. Pressure transmitting holes 112 for transmitting pressure to the rupture discs 120 are formed at positions cor¬responding to pipes 121 on which the rapture discs 120 are mounted. The support part 110 defines space for flowing insulating oil between the welding parts 113 which are bent toward the back of the support part and the inner wall of the transformer, thus helping cool the transformer. The support part 110 prevents the shielding plates 111 from being directly mounted to the tank 10, thus allowing the tank 10 to sensitively react to variations in internal pressure. Meanwhile, when the effect of the magnetic field is slight and thus the shielding plates are not required, the shielding plates and the support part may be omitted.<br>
The rupture discs 120 rapture when the internal pressure of the transformer exceeds a predetermined pressure level, thus ehminating the internal pressure. The rupture discs 120 are mounted respectively on the plurality of pipes 121 extending outwards from the transformer tank 10. Since the rapture discs 120 mounted to the respective pipes 121 are already known, the detailed description of the rupture discs will be omitted. In the prior ait, one to three rupture discs 120 were installed. However, according to the present invention, the deformation of the transformer tank fun¬damentally reduces the internal pressure for 0.08 seconds when an arc is generated. The remaining pressure is secondarily reduced by the rupture discs which are almost simultaneously operated. Thus, the number of rupture discs is calculated so that the increased pressure does not reach the rapture pressure of the tank. This means that the number of rapture discs is multiplied by a factor of 5 or over, compared to the con¬ventional number of rapture discs per unit area. The rapture discs are uniformly<br>
3<br><br>
installed throughout the surface of the transformer, so that they are operated regardless of the arc generating position, even in the case the rupture discs are distant from the arc generating position. Moreover, the tank to which the invention is applied is made of a high-su'engfh steel plate that has rupture limit pressure twice as high as a conventional tank. When bushing turrets 20 supplying an electric current to the transformer have a large size, the rupture discs 120 may be installed to eliminate pressure generated in the bushing turrets 20. In a detailed description, subsidiary pipes 122 are installed to couple the bushing tuixets 20 to the relief tanks 130. The rupture discs 120 are mounted to the subsidiary pipes 122, and rupture when the internal pressure of the bushing turrets 20 rises and exceeds a predetermined pressure level, thus eliminating the pressure.<br>
The relief tanks 130 provide space for storing insulating oil discharged through passages which are formed by the rupture of the rupture discs 120. The relief tanks having a cylindrical shape are vertically installed at a position neighboring the transformer, and are coupled to the transformer tank 110 via the pipes 121. A flexible tube 123 which is freely bendable is provided on one end of each pipe 121 and is coupled to the relief tank 130, thus allowing the pipes 121 to be more easily coupled to the relief tanks 130. The relief tanks 130 are coupled to each other by coupling pipes 131. When some of the rupture discs 120 are ruptured and passages are formed, insulating oil flows concentratedly into the associated relief tanks 130. In order to distribute the insulating oil, the relief tanks 130 are coupled to each other via the coupling pipes 131, so that the discharged insulating oil is distributed to the several relief tanks 130 to be stored therein.<br>
Meanwhile, each of the relief tanks 130 is constructed so that the bottom surface 130a of the relief tank is inclined toward each oil gauge 140. This construction allows the oil gauge 140 to more rapidly detect whether insulating oil is being discharged or not. Further, an opening 132 is formed in the upper end of each relief tank 130 to discharge combustion gas fed together with the insulating oil. The opening 132 is formed toward the transformer 100 to prevent a worker from being injured. A steel net 133 is installed in the opening 132 to prevent impurities, insects, and small animals from entering the opening 132. Further, a manhole 134 is formed at a predetermined position in each relief tank 130, so that a worker enters the manhole and thus checks the interior and repairs the oil gauge 140.<br>
The oil gauge 140 is mounted to the lower portion in each relief tank 130, and generates a signal when the insulating oil flows into the relief tank 130, thus informing a manager of the rupture of each rupture disc 120 and the discharge of the insulating oil.<br>
The operation of the system for preventing the rupture of the transformer tank,<br><br>
which is constructed as described above, will be described in the following.<br>
For various reasons, the insulation in the transformer may break and the pressure in the transformer may increase suddenly. At this time, the transformer tank 10 is deformed and thus expands, thus primarily reducing the pressure, because, as described above, the shielding plates ] 11 are not directly mounted to the transformer tank 10 using the support part 110 so as to increase the limit of the deformation of the transformer tank 10. The pressure is reduced due to the deformation of the transformer tank 10, and simultaneously, the rupture discs 120. which rupture when a pre¬determined pressure level is reached, are operated, so that the combustion gas and the insulating oil are discharged through the pipes 121 to the relief tanks 130, thus eliminating the pressure generated in the transformer. Meanwhile, when the insulating oil discharged through the pipes 121 flows into the relief tanks 130, the oil gauges 140 generate signals. In response to the signals, a manager can rapidly check the condition of the transformer.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment according to the present invention has been disclosed with reference to the accompanying drawings, the invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and those skilled in the ail will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims. Advantageous Effects<br>
As described above, the limit of the deformation of a tank constituting a transformer is increased, and in addition, the number of rupture discs installed per unit area is increased, thus more effectively eliminating internal pressure caused by abnormal voltage. Moreover, even when an arc is generated at a position distant from the rupture discs, the transformer tank is deformed, thus eliminating pressure, therefore allowing the transformer to be more safely manufactured.
