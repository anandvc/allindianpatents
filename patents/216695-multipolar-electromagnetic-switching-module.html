				<td>MULTIPOLAR ELECTROMAGNETIC SWITCHING MODULE<br>
The present invention relates to a multipolar electromagnetic switching module that is connected by line connections to a main multipolar electromagnetic switching device and by load connections to at least 5 one motor and having between said connections several power current lines fitted with switching poles the contacts of which are always alternately closed, and controlled by a switching electromagnet driven by an electric control circuit.<br>
10<br>
The construction of motor control circuits consisting of reverser, star-delta starter, speed-changing mechanism, etc. is known by combining several devices  (contactors,  etc.)  whose power supplies and<br>
15  control  systems  are  interconnected  to  create  the desired circuit. But this type of system is bulky.<br>
French patents FR 2,758,903 and FR 2,761,521 disclose a reverser-type module capable of switching a motor from forward to reverse operation and vice-versa.<br>
20  This module is also bulky.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to achieve a switching module capable of providing integrated motor control (reversing operating direction, star-delta start-up, etc.) of reduced width, i.e. more or less the<br>
25 same as the width of the contactor or standard electrical device with which it is paired to perform the said function. The module is thus of reduced width. It is also protected by the main device that is associated with it and connected upstream.<br>
30       The  switching  module  of  the  invention  is characterized in that the poles and power lines are<br><br>
the reversing, star-aexca start-up and distribution functions are controlled and such that the pole control assembly consisting of the switching electromagnet and 5 the electric control circuit is offset relative to the switching poles and load paths in a direction perpendicular to the rear fastening surface of the module such that the width of the module is reduced and more or less identical to that of the main device 10  associated with it.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to embodiments given as non-limitative examples and shown in the attached figures, wherein: 15 - Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a reverser-type switching module associated with a main switching device;<br>

-	Figure 10 is a diagram of an embodiment of the<br>
control circuit of the electromagnet of the module.<br>
10 The electromagnetic switching device of the invention, marked M in the figures, is designed to operate in conjunction with a multipolar electromagnetic switching device Ap that may include a contactor-  or  contactor/circuit-breaker-type  motor-<br>
15 protection device. It may be included, together with devices like Ap, in standard circuits such as reversers, star-delta starter systems, distribution systems and speed-changing mechanisms.<br>
In a unit, main switching device Ap houses polar<br>
20 power lines disposed between line connections Ll, L2, L3 connected to the phases of the AC power supply and load connections Tl, T2, T3 that may be connected to switching module M. Each power line has a switch or pole II, 12 or 13 controlled by main electromagnet E,<br>
25 the coil B of which is powered by two power supply connections Al and A2.<br>
Switching module M is housed in a unit Bo the rear of which is provided with a more or less plane fastening base P enabling it to be fastened to a rail<br>
30 or plate. It has line (power) connections tl, t2, t3 connected directly to the downstream connections Tl, T2, T3 of main device AP and output or load (power)<br><br>
connections U, V, W and u, v, w connected to the motor or motors.<br>
Switching module M may be mounted directly under device Ap or it may be offset. 5 The power lines running between line connections tl, t2, t3 and the output or load connections are fitted with single bistable trigger switching poles CI, C2, C3. These poles CI, C2, C3 are activated by a bistable electromagnet EI fitted with a coil Bb and<br>
10 their contacts are always alternately closed except during switching. Module M has no arc extinction device and cannot therefore be operated under load. The number of connections tl, t2, t3 is equal to the number of connections Tl, T2, T3, the number of poles CI, C2, C3<br>
15 also being equal to or less than this number of connections.<br>
Poles CI, C2, C3 and the internal wiring Sc of the associated power lines perform a standard motor control function:  reverser,  star-delta or distribution,  low-<br>
20 speed/high speed. The wiring of the power circuit of module M is dependent on the control function performed by this module.<br>
In the reverser embodiment shown in figure 1, line connection t3 is connected directly to load connection<br>
25  W. Line connections tl and t2 are connected (forward operation) to load connections U and V via poles CI, C2 and after switching the same poles (reverse operation) to connections V and U, thereby achieving the usual crossing of the phases,<br>
30 In the embodiments shown in figures 2, 3 and 4 designed respectively to effect star-delta start-up, distribution and change of speed, line connections tl, t2, t3 are disposed on one side of the module while<br>
5"<br><br>
load connections U, V, W (star-delta, first motor or<br>
high-speed  start-up)  and  load connections  u,  v,  w<br>
(star-delta,  second motor or low-speed start-up) are<br>
disposed on the other side. Connections U, V, W and<br>
5  connections u, v, w are offset relative to one another.<br>
Bistable-type electromagnet EI,  which is housed<br>
inside switching module M and operates the movable<br>
contacts of switching poles CI, C2, C3, is fitted with<br>
a  permanent  magnet  designed  to  reduce  energy<br>
10 consumption. Said electromagnet EI is driven by the internal control circuit Cc shown in figure 10. The movable magnetic section of electromagnet EI, which has an alternating rectilinear movement, moves switching poles  CI,  C2,  C3  by means  of  a  slider  Ra.  The<br>
15 displacement axis of this electromagnet is preferably parallel to fastening plane Pf and the connections.<br>
Switching module M is constructed so that switching poles Cl, C2, C3 and the associated circuits, together  with  the  control  assembly  of  the  poles<br>
20 constituted by electromagnet EI and control circuit Cc are offset or spaced in a direction perpendicular to rear fastening surface Pf of the module, and so that the width L of the module is more or less equal to the width of main switching device AP. Width L is therefore<br>
25 less than that of standard devices performing similar functions. Switching poles Cl, C2, C3 and conductors Sc of the circuit (reverser, etc.) are housed towards the rear, electromagnet EI and associated control circuit Cc being housed forward.<br>
30 Each switching pole Cl, C2 or C3 shown schematically in figure 6 is of the reverser type (i.e. the contacts are always closed) and consists of a movable  contact  holder  Pc  bearing  two  loop-shaped<br>
6<br><br>
parallel conductors Cml, Cm2 bearing movable contacts PI and P2 respectively. These conductors meet at a connection tl, t2, t3. Contact holder Pc oscillates around a pin Ax and an axis A-A" between two conductors 5 Cfl, Cf2 bearing fixed contacts P3 and P4. These conductors are also loop-shaped and connected to one or two connections U, V, W. In the embodiment shown the axes are perpendicular to rear fastening plane Pf.<br>
Movable contact-holder Pc oscillates around axis<br>
10 A-A" between a first operating position in which the contacts are closed and a second operating position in which the contacts are also closed. The current passing through movable conductor Cml or Cm2 and in parallel directions through the corresponding fixed conductor<br>
15 Cfl or Cf2 produces a magnetic attraction force. This loop effect produces a contact pressure that is proportional to the current flowing through the pole. The poles are never activated under load, thereby making it possible to reduce nominal contact pressure<br>
20  and therefore the size of the electromagnet required.<br>
The movable sections of the electromagnet drive a slider Ra that moves in translation parallel to rear fastening plane Pf by acting on each pole spring Rp via a component Pi,<br>
25 Fixed conductors Cfl, Cf2, together with extensions or additional conductors ending in load (power)connections U, V, W etc. constitute one of the control circuits Sc of the motor or motors. Said extensions or additional conductors are housed in the<br>
30  load connection side of unit Bo.<br>
Movable conductors Cml, Cm2 of contact-holder PC are far enough apart from one another to enable a magnetic core No to be housed between them.  Said<br>
7<br><br>
magnetic core No operates in conjunction with counterplates Cpl, Cp2 fastened inside the switching chamber housing the pole. The movable contact parts Cml, Cm2 are connected by a flexible electrical link Tr 5 and a conductor such as Co3 to a line connection such as t3.<br>
The control input and output connections are disposed forward. Input connections A2, Al, Al" , Bl, Bl" are designed to receive the motor command signals<br>
10 and the output connections SAl, S21, S22 operate in conjunction with the associated main switching device Ap.<br>
Main switching device Ap includes a locking contact  Ve  activated  by  the  movable  section  of<br>
15 electromagnet E and connected to two connections 21 and 22 that can be connected to connections SAl and SA2 of module M.<br>
Coil Bb of electromagnet EI is powered so that it is  polarized  in  one  direction or the  other.  This<br>
20 command may be achieved by two auxiliary reverser contacts la and lb that are activated by the movable section of bistable electromagnet EI and associated with diodes 7a, 7b. Switching module M may comprise other auxiliary contacts such as 3 and 6 that are also<br>
25  activated by the movable section of electromagnet EI.<br>
To implement the invention, the contacts Bpl controlling operation in "direction one" and contacts Bp2 controlling operation in "direction two" are connected to connections Al, A"l, Bl, B"l of switching<br>
30 module M. "Direction one" is understood to mean one of the two operating modes of the module, i.e. direct operation for the reverser or in star mode for star-<br><br>
delta. "Direction two" is understood to mean the second mode, i.e. reverse operation or delta mode.<br>
Operation of the switching module will now be described. 5 In the position shown in figure 10, electromagnet EI of main switching device Ap is powered via ON/OFF switch MA, contacts Bpl, Bp2 and 6. Power poles II, 12 and 13 of main switching device Ap are in "direction one" operating position. The switching poles such as<br>
10 CI, C2 of switching module M are in the "direction one" operating position (these poles are always in the closed position).<br>
In  order  to  change  to  "direction  two",  the operator  opens  contact  Bp2  and  closes  associated<br>
15 contact Bp2. Opening the contact cuts the power supply to coil B of main switching device Ap. Power switches II to 13 of main switching device Ap then open.<br>
Closing contact Bp2 causes coil Bp  of module M to be energized, thereby changing over switching contacts<br>
20 such as Cl, C2. The auxiliary contacts of module M change over and power is routed to electromagnet E of main switching device Ap so that power switches II - 13 are moved.<br>
Electromagnet EI of switching module M can only<br>
25 change over when power contacts II - 13 are open. This safety function is ensured by locking contact Ve. Moreover, power contacts II - 13 close when the contacts of switching module M are in the correct position.<br>
30 In order to avoid cutting the power supply while electromagnet EI is moving, the auxiliary contacts must change position after electromagnet EI has moved through all or most of its travel. A status-change<br><br>
delaying device may be associated with these three contacts.<br>
It is clear that other versions and improvements can be imagined or equivalent means used without going 5  outside the scope of the invention.<br>
Another version could, for example, avoid using semiconductors (diodes or small protective components) in control circuit Cc.<br><br><br>
