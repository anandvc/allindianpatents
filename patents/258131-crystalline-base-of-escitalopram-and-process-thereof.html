				<td>CRYSTALLINE BASE OF ESCTTALOPRAM AND ORODISPERSIBLE TABLETS COMPRISING ESCITALOPRAM BASE<br>
The present invasion relates in a first aspect to the crystalline base of the wee known antidepressant drug escitalopram, 5'-l-[3-(dimethylaniino) propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyI)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofiirancarbonitrile, formulations of said base, processes for the preparation of purified escitalopram free base and salts Ihcreof, using the crystalline base or hydrobromide of escitalopram, the salts obtained by said process and formulations containing such salts. In a second aspect the present invention relates to orodispersible tablets comprising an active pharmaceutical ingredient adsorbed onto a water-soluble filler wherein said active pharmaceutical ingredient has a melting point in the range of 40-100 °C, and methods for the manufacture of such orodispersible tablets.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Escitalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) readtake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities.<br>
Escitalopram was first disclosed in US 4,943,590. The escitalopram prepared was isolated as the oxalate. Furthermore, the escitalopram base was obtained as an oil. Escitalopram is marketed eyes the oxalate.<br><br>
Escitalopram may inter alia be prepared according to the processes disclosed in WO 2003006449 and WO 2003051861.<br>
Crystalline escitalopram hydrobromide was disclosed in WO 2004056791.<br>
Orodispersible tablets have gained considerable attention over the last years. Orodispersible tablets disintegrate in Ire mouth and are, subsequently, swallowed. This is advantageous for patients having difficulties swallowing convCTrtional tablet formulations and, consequently, orodispersible tablets increase not only patient convenience but also patient compliance. The active pharmaceutical ingredient that is incorporated in the fast disintegrating tablet may partly or completely dissolve in the mouth, thereby enabling absorption to take place from the oral cavity.<br>
In literature, several semis have been applied for orodispersible tablets. Amongst these are fast dissolving tablets, fast dispersing tablets, fest disintegrating tablets, melt tablets, rapid dissolve tablets, rapid-melt tablets, mouth-dissolving tablets, quick-disintegrating tablets.<br>
Various methods have been ^&gt;plied to manufacture fast disintegrating tablets. Many of the methods make use of unconventional equipment and complicated processing techniques such as lyophilization and foam techniques. Many of these methods result in fast disintegrating tablets with poor tablet strength and low friabUity. This may prevent the use of conventional packaging material and conventional picking procedures.<br>
WO2005/018617 discloses Ire use of conventional melt granulation to produce granules from a low melting point compound that melts or soften at or below 37 'C, and a -soluble excipient The granules were subsequently mixed with active pharmaceutical ingredient and additional excipient and then compressed to yield fast dissolving tablets of low hardness, 2.2 kip or less.<br>
Manufacturing methods that are based on the use of conventional equipment and techniques and that result in sty disintegrating tablets verity sufficient strength are therefore desirable.<br><br>
It has now been found that the base of escitalopram may be obtained as a very pure crystalline product, which may easily be handled and formulated conveniently into tablets and other pharmaceutical forms. Furthermore, it has been found that an efficient purification of escitalopram may be obtained during manufacture of escitalopram (e.g. of the oxalate salt) by crystallising the base, and thereafter: optionally forming a salt from the base.<br>
It has likewise been found tilt a very efficient purification of escitalopram may be obtained during manufacture of escitalopram (e.g. of the free base or the oxalate salt) by crystallising the hydrobromide, and thereafter optionally forming the base or a salt, "voice is not the hydrobromide, from the base.<br>
These purification processes are particularly useful for removing intermediates which are structurally closely related to escitalopram, in particular compounds rich only differ from escitalopram by the substituents situated in position 5 on the isobenzofurane ring and/or in lacking one or bowtie of the methyl groups, and intermediates Stoics have physical/chemical properties which are close to those of escitalopram, e.g. the l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]"l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofiiranes having halogen (in particular bromide and chloride), an amide or an ester in position 5 of the isobenzofiirane ring, or the compounds of formula (IH).<br>
Furthermore, a novel type of orodispersible tablets with high strength and low friability has been developed. These novel orodispersible tablets can be manufactured in a melt agglomeration process, melt coating process or melt extrusion process that can be performed using conventional melt agglomation equipment or melt extrusion equipment. In the process the active pharmaceutical ingredient is heated to a temperature above, around or slightly below the melting point to melt agglomerate or melt coat filler particles. The agglomerates or the coated filler particles are, subsequently, mixed with suitable excipient and compressed into tablets.<br>
Escitalopram base has been found to be suitable for formulation in such orodispersible tablets.<br><br>

Solutions for injections may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient and possible additives in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the solution to the desired volume, sterihsation of the solution and filling in suitable ampoules or vials.<br><br>
Any suitable additive conventionally used in the art may t&gt;e added, such as tonicity agents, preservatives, antioxidants, solubility enhancing agents etc.<br>
According to the present invention, the base of escitalopram has been found to be crystalline with stable white crystals and it has been foxed teat the base may be crystallized easily in a very pure form. So for example pure escitalopram base containing less than 0.2 % of impurities different from i?-citalopram, particularly less than 0.1 % was obtained by crystallisation from at least 95% pure escitalopram hydrobromide without further purification. In a particular embodiment, pure escitalopram base that contains less than 0.1 % of any particular impurity was obtained. Accordingly, the process of ties invention for parbaring salts of escitalopram has been found to give the salts as very pure products of pharmaceutically acceptable quality. Accordingly, the yield may be improved substantially during the manufacture of escitalopram.<br>
Melt agglomeration is an agglomeration process whereby a molten binder liquids is used. The molten binder solidifies at room temperature. One such binder is referred to as Mel table binder. In a melt agglomeration process, the process is usually conducted at elevated temperatures. The process temperature can be similar to the temperature at which the binder melts, but it can also be higher and even below the melting point. Once the process temperature reach the level that causes melting or softening of the binder, the binder aid the formation and growth of agglomerates. During the agglomeration process the temperature may be non-uniform in the mixture due to local fiiction forces resulting in local fiiction heating. This results in that part of the binder may be solid vsiiereas other parts may be melted or softened. The agglomeration process may proceed by either the distribution mechanism, the immersion mechanism or by a combination of the two mechanisms. When agglomerates of the desired size are formed, the agglomerates are cooled to a temperature below 40 °C whereby the molten or softened binder congeals. The agglomerates can, subsequentiy, be mixed with excipients prior to compression into tablets.<br>
The process may also be conducted so that agglomeration does not take place. In that case, the process could be tamed a melt coating process. The procedure is similar to the one described for melt agglomeration. The only diffK-ence is that the coating material, i.e. the meltable binder, will distribute over the filler particles resulting in a more or less<br><br>
homogeneous coating layer. To avoid agglomeration, the processing conditions or the amount of coating material, i.e. meltable binder relative to the amount of filler particles must be controlled. The coated filler particles can subsequently be mixed with excipients prior to compression into tablets.<br>
The meltable binder used in melt agglomeration is usually polyethylene glycols, fatty acids, fatty alcohols or glycosides. It has now been found that phannaceutically active substances with a suitable melting point may be used as a meltable bind^ in a melt agglomeration process. Suitable melting points are in the range of 40-100 '^C.<br>
In one embodiment, the agglomerate or coated filler particle is prepared by melting the active pharmaceutical ingredient and spraying or pouring the melt on the filler. The spraying or pouring step may be performed in accordance with known procedures.<br>
In anotiier embodiment all constituents of the agglomerate or coated filler particle are added to a high shear mixer, optionally provided with a heating jacket By operating the high shear mixer the friction heat and/or heat supplied by the heating jacket will melt the active pharmaceutical ingredient which deposits onto the filler. This method is a very attractive method for melt agglomeration, because the method is fast and easy to perform.<br>
Melt extrusion is a process wherein the low melting point compound and the filler are mixed and heated in a mixer that is usually part of the extruder. The soft mass is then fed to the extrusion chamber and forced through small holes or orifices to shape it into thin rods or cylinders. The melt extrusion process may alternatively be conducted by mixing the low melting compound and the filler in an unheated mixer. The mixture is, subsequently, transferred to a heated extruder. In the heated extruder, the low melting compound melts and enables the formation of soft mass in the extrusion chamber. The soft mass is forced through small holes or orifices to shape it into thin rods or cylinders. After the extruded material congeals it can be milled or spheronized using standard equipment.<br>
Agglomerates, coated filler particles or extricates according to the invention may be prepared using procedures and apparatus known within time art for melt agglom^ation.<br><br>
Exemplary of apparatus, which may be used are low shear mixers, high shear mixers, fluid beds, fluid bed granulators, rotary fluidised beds and drum granulators.<br>
Prior to tablet production, prestart operations is required to establish the compression force needed to compress tablets of the denned hardness, friability etc. Those skilled in the art will know how to adjust &amp;e compression force in order to obtain the desired hardness and/or friability. It is, however, known for the skilled people within ties art, that the compressibility of the formulation determines what tablet hardness can be achieved by a given compression force.<br>
The invention is ftirther illustrated by the following examples.<br>
