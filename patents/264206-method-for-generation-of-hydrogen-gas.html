				<td>METHOD FOR GENERATION OF HYDROGEN GAS<br>
This invention relates to a method for generation of hydrogen gas from a borohydride-containing formulation. This method is useful for hydrogen generation in fuel cells.<br>
Borohydride-containing compositions are known as hydrogen sources for hydrogen fuel cells, usually in the form of aqueous solutions. Solid borohydride-containing compositions also have been used. For example, U.S. Pub. No. 2005/0238573 discloses the use of solid sodium borohydride, which is combined with aqueous acid to produce hydrogen. However, the problem of excessive foaming during the generation of hydrogen is not adequately addressed by this reference.<br>
The problem addressed by this invention is to find a method for generation of hydrogen gas from a borohydride-containing formulation that allows hydrogen generation with reduced foaming.<br>

At least one of the solid composition and the liquid contains at least one substance that catalyzes hydrolysis of borohydride, i.e., salts of transition metals in groups 8, 9 and 10; such as Co, Ru, Ni, Fe, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, or mixtures thereof; and borides of Co and/or Ni.

When the catalyst is present primarily in the liquid, in some embodiments the concentration is at least 3%, alternatively at least 4%, alternatively at least 4.5%, alternatively at least 5%, alternatively at least 8%, alternatively at least 9%; in some embodiments the concentration is no more than 20%, alternatively no more than 15%, alternatively no more than 12%; in these embodiments the solid composition preferably contains no more than 2% catalyst, alternatively no more than 1%, alternatively no more than 0.5%, alternatively no more than 0.2%, alternatively no more than 0.1%, alternatively no more than 0.05%. In some embodiments, the sum of the level of catalyst in the solid composition and the level in the liquid is no more than 15%, alternatively no more than 14%, alternatively no more than 13%, alternatively no more than 12%, alternatively no more than 11%, alternatively no more than 10%, alternatively no more than 9%, alternatively no more than 8%; in some embodiments, the sum is at least 4%, alternatively at least 4.5%, alternatively at least 5%. In some embodiments of the invention, the<br>
added to the solid composition contains less than 5% of anything other than water and catalyst, alternatively less than 4%, alternatively less than 3%, alternatively less than 2%, alternatively less than 1%, alternatively less than 0.5%.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the water content of the solid composition is no more than 2%, alternatively no more than 1%, alternatively no more than 0.5%, alternatively no more than 0.3%, alternatively no more than 0.2%, alternatively no more than 0.1%. In some embodiments of the invention in which the base comprises potassium hydroxide, the water content may be higher than these limits, providing the water is bound to the potassium hydroxide and the base does not melt below 50°C. In some embodiments of the invention, the solid composition contains no more than 20% of anything other than the borohydride compound and the base, alternatively no more than 15%, alternatively no more than 10%, alternatively no more than 5%, alternatively no more than 3%. Preferably, the solid composition contains no more than 10% of anything other than the borohydride compound, the base and the transition metal salt, alternatively no more than 5%, alternatively no more than 3%, alternatively no more than 2%, alternatively no more than 1%. Other possible constituents of the solid composition include, e.g., catalysts, anti-foam agents and surfactants. In some embodiments of the invention, the solid composition is substantially or completely free of metal hydrides other than borohydrides, e.g., alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydrides, MH or MH2, respectively; and aluminum hydride compounds, e.g., MAIH4. The term "substantially free of means containing less than 1%, alternatively less than 0.5%, alternatively less than 0.2%, alternatively less than 0.1%.<br>
Preferably, the temperature of the solid composition and the liquid are in the range from -60°C to 100°C, alternatively from -50°C to 50°C, alternatively from -40°C to 45°C, alternatively from -30°C to 45°C, alternatively from -20°C to 40°C. When the liquid activator comprises almost entirely water, temperatures below 0°C are attainable by including anti-freeze agents, such as alcohols or glycols in the aqueous solution. Aqueous catalyst solutions also may include anti-freeze agents. The rate of addition may vary depending on the desired rate<br>
hydrogen generation. Preferred addition rates are in the range from 10 to 300 uL/min to generate a flow rate of 5 to 300 mL/min of hydrogen gas. Preferably, the mixture formed when the solid composition contacts the aqueous solution is not agitated.<br>
The method of this invention allows generation of hydrogen at a useful rate with the capability of stopping said generation relatively quickly after stopping the addition of the aqueous solution. This capability is important in hydrogen fuel cells, where power generation on demand is a key concern. Inability to stop the flow of hydrogen is detrimental to rapid on/off operation of the fuel cell. Linearity of hydrogen generation over time and/or the amount of aqueous solution added is also an important capability in a hydrogen fuel cell.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Samples of the solid fuel compositions listed below in Table 1 were prepared in powder and/or pellet form. The required amounts of SBH powder, metal hydroxide powder and catalyst were mixed in a coffee grinder for two minutes or placed in a polypropylene bottle and shaken by hand for 10 minutes. Pellets were produced in caplet form under a pressure of 10,000 psi (68.9 kPa). The indicated liquid activator (all are aqueous solutions) was added at ambient temperature (ca. 20-25°C) at a rate of 250 uL/min for 10 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of observation without further addition, and then this cycle was repeated until 60 minutes had elapsed. The liquid activator was pumped via a syringe pump into a graduated cylinder capped with a gas outlet and septum with an 18-gauge needle. The outlet was connected to either a wet test meter or a water displacement apparatus connected to a balance. The foam volume was observed for each sample at 1 minute intervals. The maximum foam volume reading, and the sum of all observed foam volume readings, are presented in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Foam Height Data from Borohydride Hydrolysis<br>
(TABLE REMOVED)<br>
1.	Samples in upper part of table are comparative, lower are within scope of invention<br>
2.	The sum of foam volume is the total of the foam volume measurements.<br>
The maximum foam volume (3rd and 5th columns) is the primary concern in a hydrogen generation apparatus. Table 1 shows that this measurement is markedly lower for the compositions of this invention, as compared with other compositions. The sum of foam volume is a secondary consideration, and is a measure of how quickly the foam volume decreases after reaching its maximum level.<br>
Pure SBH powder and 87% SBH/13% NaOH were tested also with 3% C0CI2 as the liquid activator, but these combinations produced hydrogen at a very low rate of only about 20 mL/min at the relatively high addition rate (250 uL/min). This low rate is considered unacceptable for a practical commercial device. SBH or SBH/MOH mixtures without catalyst (M=alkali or alkaline earth metal) with a liquid activator completely lacking either catalyst or acid would generate hydrogen at even slower rates, and therefore such mixtures were not tested.<br>
Water containing 2% NaOH was added to a powder mixture containing 80% SBH, 14% NaOH, 6% C0CI2, with a resulting maximum foam volume of 50 mL, and a sum of foam volume of 1260.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
