Stirring was continued till all magnesium reacted, then ether was removed under vaccum till slurry was formed (A). In another single neck R.B. flask furan (4.76 g, 70 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (100 ml) was cooled with ice-salt mixture, n-butyllithium (2M, 35 ml, 70 mmol) was added dropwise, and stirred at 0°C for 45 min (B). Fury lithium thus prepared in flask (B) was added to cold mixture in (A) through cannula, stirred at 0°C for 5 min, brought to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h and then cooled to -20°C (dry ice + CCl4). Substituted benzaldehyde (51.02 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) was added and stirred at -20°C for 4 h (monitored by TLC). After completion of reaction the mixture was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride solution. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure and residue extracted with ethyl acetate.
