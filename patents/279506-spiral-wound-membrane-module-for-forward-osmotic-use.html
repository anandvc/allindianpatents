RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority to United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application serial number 61/070,087, filed March 20, 2008; which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY<br>
One or more aspects relates generally to osmotic separation. More particularly,<br>
one or more aspects relate to membrane modules for use in engineered osmosis, such<br>
as pressure retarded osmosis or any osmotic separation of solutes and water from an<br>
aqueous solution by, for example, forward osmosis, such as seawater desalination,<br>
brackish water desalination, wastewater purification and contaminated water<br>
remediation.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Forward osmosis has been used for desalination. In general, a forward osmosis<br>
desalination process involves a container having two chambers separated by a semipermeable<br>
membrane. One chamber contains seawater. The other chamber contains<br>
a concentrated solution that generates a concentration gradient between the seawater<br>
and the concentrated solution. This gradient draws water from the seawater across<br>
the membrane, which selectively permits water to pass but not salts, into the<br>
concentrated solution. Gradually, the water entering the concentrated solution dilutes<br>
the solution. The solutes are then removed from the dilute solution to generate<br>
potable water.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, an osmotic method for<br>
extracting water from an aqueous solution may generally involve exposing the<br>
aqueous solution to a first surface of a forward osmosis membrane. A second solution,<br>
or draw solution, with an increased concentration relative to that of the aqueous<br>
solution may be exposed to a second opposed surface of the forward osmosis<br>
membrane. Water may then be drawn from the aqueous solution through the forward<br>
osmosis membrane and into the second solution generating a water-enriched solution<br>
via forward osmosis which utihzes fluid transfer properties involving movement from<br>
a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution. The water-enriched<br>
solution, also referred to as a dilute draw solution, may be collected at a first outlet<br>
and undergo a further separation process to produce purified water. A second<br>
5<br>
product stream, i.e. a depleted or concentrated aqueous process solution, may be<br>
collected at a second outlet for discharge or further treatment.<br>
Hydraulic pressure may generally promote transport of the first and second<br>
solutions through a membrane module along a longitudinal axis of their respective<br>
channels, while osmotic pressure may generally promote transport of water across a<br>
forward osmosis membrane in the module from the feed to the draw solution.<br>
Alternately, hydraulic pressure may be exerted on the feed solution to assist the flow<br>
of water from the feed to draw solutions, or hydraulic pressure may be placed on the<br>
draw solution to allow the production of power from the expansion of the volume of<br>
the draw solution due to membrane flux of water from the feed solution driven by the<br>
osmotic pressure difference between the two solutions (PRO). Generally, flow<br>
channels within the module are designed to minimize the hydraulic pressure<br>
necessary to cause flow through these channels (crossflow], but this is often at odds<br>
with the desire to create turbulence in the flow channels, beneficial for efficient<br>
generation of osmotic pressure difference between the two solutions, which has a<br>
tendency to increase resistance to flow. Higher osmotic pressure differences may<br>
generally increase transmembrane flux, but may also have a tendency to increase the<br>
amount of heat required to separate the draw solutes from the dilute draw solution<br>
for production of a dilute water product and a reconcentrated draw solution.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may include one or more forward osmosis membranes. The forward osmosis<br>
membranes may generally be semi-permeable, for example, allowing the passage of<br>
water, but excluding dissolved solutes therein, such as sodium chloride, ammonium<br>
carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, and ammonium carbamate. Many types of semipermeable<br>
membranes are suitable for this purpose provided that they are capable of<br>
allowing the passage of water (i.e., the solvent) while blocking the passage of the<br>
solutes and not reacting with the solutes in the solution. The membrane can have a<br>
variety of configurations including thin films, hollow fiber membranes, spiral wound<br>
membranes, monofilaments and disk tubes. There are numerous well-known,<br>
commercially available semi-permeable membranes that are characterized by having<br>
pores small enough to allow water to pass while screening out solute molecules such<br>
as sodium chloride and their ionic molecular species such as chloride. Such semi-<br>
6<br>
permeable membranes can be made of organic or inorganic materials. In some<br>
embodiments, membranes made of materials such as cellulose acetate, cellulose<br>
nitrate, polysulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyamide and acrylonitrile co-polymers<br>
may be used. Other membranes may be mineral membranes or ceramic membranes<br>
made of materials such as Zr02 and Ti02.<br>
Preferably, the material selected for use as the semi-permeable membrane<br>
should generally be able to withstand various process conditions to which the<br>
membrane may be subjected. For example, it may be desirable that the membrane be<br>
able to withstand elevated temperatures, such as those associated with sterilization or<br>
other high temperature processes. In some embodiments, a forward osmosis<br>
membrane module maybe operated at a temperature in the range of about 0 degrees<br>
Celsius to about 100 degrees Celsius. In some non-limiting embodiments, process<br>
temperatures may range from about 40 degrees Celsius to about 50 degrees Celsius.<br>
Likewise, it may be desirable for the membrane to be able to maintain integrity under<br>
various pH conditions. For example, one or more solutions in the membrane<br>
environment, such as the draw solution, may be more or less acidic or basic. In some<br>
non-limiting embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane module may be operated at<br>
a pH level of between about 2 and about 11. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
pH level may be about 7 to about 10. The membranes used need not be made out of<br>
one of these materials and they can be composites of various materials. In at least one<br>
embodiment, the membrane may be an asymmetric membrane, such as with an active<br>
layer on a first surface, and a supporting layer on a second surface. In some<br>
embodiments, an active layer may generally be a rejecting layer. For example, a<br>
rejecting layer may block passage of salts in some non-limiting embodiments. In some<br>
embodiments, a supporting layer, such as a backing layer, may generally be inactive.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the at least one forward<br>
osmosis membrane of the membrane module may be spirally wound. A spiral wound<br>
configuration may be generally efficient in terms of facilitating forward osmosis<br>
within the module. The spiral wound configuration may be desirable in terms of<br>
containment of large amounts of surface area per unit of volume. The spiral wound<br>
configuration may also be desirable in terms of surface area contact along a fluid flow<br>
path with respect to residence time of a process stream within the forward osmosis<br>
7<br>
membrane module. The membrane module may also be beneficially designed so as to<br>
reduce frictional resistance to fluid crossflow through the fluid flow channels, and to<br>
reduce dead spaces and poor mass transport, while encouraging turbulent flow. In at<br>
least one embodiment, both draw and feed solutions may travel along the longitudinal<br>
axis of the membrane module with minimal resistance or diversion of flow. A spirally<br>
wound forward osmosis membrane module may be of any desired dimensions.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, at least one forward osmosis<br>
membrane may be positioned within a housing or casing. The housing may generally<br>
be sized and shaped to accommodate the membranes positioned therein. For<br>
example, the housing may be substantially cylindrical if housing spirally wound<br>
forward osmosis membranes. The housing of the module may contain inlets to<br>
provide feed and draw solutions to the module as well as outlets for withdrawal of<br>
product streams from the module. In some embodiments, the housing may provide at<br>
least one reservoir or chamber for holding or storing a fluid to be introduced to or<br>
withdrawn from the module. In at least one embodiment, the housing may be<br>
insulated. In some non-limiting embodiments, a module assembly may be sealed<br>
inside a tubular housing such that seawater is passed into a space in-between epoxy<br>
blocks and the main sheet winding. Draw solution may pass through the interior of<br>
flat tubes leading the solution across a supporting layer side within the sheet winding.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may generally be constructed and arranged so as to bring a first solution and a<br>
second solution into contact with first and second sides of a semi-permeable<br>
membrane, respectively. Although the first and second solutions can remain stagnant,<br>
it is preferred that both the first and second solutions are introduced by cross flow,<br>
i.e., flows parallel to the surface of the semi-permeable membrane. This may generally<br>
increase membrane surface area contact along one or more fluid flow paths, thereby<br>
increasing the efficiency of the forward osmosis. In some embodiments, the first and<br>
second solutions may flow in the same direction. In other embodiments, the first and<br>
second solutions may flow in opposite directions. In at least some embodiments,<br>
similar fluid dynamics may exist on both sides of a membrane surface. This may be<br>
achieved by strategic integration of the one or more forward osmosis membranes in<br>
the module or housing.<br>
8<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may generally be constructed and arranged to provide a first fluid flow path<br>
and a second fluid flow path. The flow paths may generally run along a longitudinal<br>
axis of the module, such as from a first end to a second end. The first and second fluid<br>
flow paths may be separated by the forward osmosis membrane. A first solution may<br>
travel along the first fluid flow path and a second solution may travel along the second<br>
fluid flow path through the module. In the case of an asymmetric forward osmosis<br>
membrane, an active layer of the membrane may be associated with a first fluid flow<br>
path, and a supporting layer may be associated with a second fluid flow path. In at<br>
least one embodiment, aqueous water to be treated, such as seawater, may be in<br>
contact with the active layer of the forward osmosis membrane while the draw<br>
solution may be in contact with the supporting layer. In other embodiments, the<br>
opposite may apply. In some embodiments, the first and second fluid flow paths may<br>
be generally or substantially parallel to one another along a longitudinal axis of the<br>
membrane module. In at least one embodiment, the first and second fluid flow paths<br>
may be substantially isolated from one another so as to generally prevent mixing<br>
therebetween, though transmembrane osmotic passage of water from the first<br>
solution to the second solution within the module is desired to effect separation and<br>
purification of the solvent as described above.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the first solution may be any<br>
aqueous solution or solvent containing one or more solutes for which separation,<br>
purification or other treatment is desired. In some embodiments, the first solution<br>
may be non-potable water such as seawater, salt water, brackish water, gray water,<br>
and some industrial water. A process stream to be treated may include salts and other<br>
ionic species such as chloride, sulfate, bromide, silicate, iodide, phosphate, sodium,<br>
magnesium, calcium, potassium, nitrate, arsenic, lithium, boron, strontium,<br>
molybdenum, manganese, aluminum, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead,<br>
nickel, selenium, silver and zinc. In some examples, the first solution may be brine,<br>
such as salt water or seawater, wastewater or other contaminated water. The first<br>
solution may be delivered to a forward osmosis membrane treatment system from an<br>
upstream unit operation such as industrial facihty, or any other source such as the<br>
ocean. The second solution may be a draw solution containing a higher concentration<br>
9<br>
of solute relative to the first solution. A wide variety of draw solutions may be used.<br>
For example, the draw solution may comprise a thermolytic salt solution. In some<br>
embodiments, an ammonia and carbon dioxide draw solution maybe used, such as<br>
those disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2005/0145568 to<br>
McGinnis which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all<br>
purposes. In one embodiment, the second solution may be a concentrated solution of<br>
ammonia and carbon dioxide. In at least one embodiment, the draw solution may<br>
comprise ammonia and carbon dioxide in a molar ratio of greater than about 1 to 1.<br>
The draw solution generally has a concentration greater than that of the feed<br>
solution. This may be achieved using solutes that are soluble enough to produce a<br>
solution that has a higher concentration than the feed solution. Preferably, the solute<br>
within the second solution should be easily removable from the second solution<br>
through a separation process, form at least one species that is more readily dissolved<br>
in the solvent of the second solution, i.e., the soluble species, and one species that is<br>
not readily dissolved within the solvent, i.e., the less-soluble species, and posses no<br>
health risk if trace amounts of the species of solute remain in the resulting solvent.<br>
The existence of the soluble and less-soluble species of solutes allows for the solutions<br>
to be adjusted or manipulated as needed. Typically, the soluble and less-soluble solute<br>
species reach a point in solution in which, under the particular condition temperature,<br>
pressure, pH, etc., neither species of solute is either increasing or decreasing with<br>
respect to the other, i.e., the ratio of the soluble to insoluble species of solute is static.<br>
This is referred to as equilibrium. Given the particular conditions of the solution, the<br>
species of solute need not be present in a one to one ratio at equilibrium. Through the<br>
addition of a chemical, referred to as a reagent, the balance between the species of<br>
solutes can be shifted. Using a first reagent, the equilibrium of the solution can be<br>
shifted to increase the amount of the soluble species of solute. Likewise, using a<br>
second reagent, the equiUbrium of the solution may be shifted to increase the amount<br>
of the less-soluble solute species. After the addition of the reagents, the ratio of species<br>
of solutes may stabilize at a new level which is favored by the conditions of the<br>
solution. By manipulating the equilibrium in favor of the soluble species of solute, a<br>
second solution with a concentration near saturation can be achieved, a state in which<br>
the solutions solvent cannot dissolve anymore of the solute.<br>
10<br>
Preferred solutes for the second (draw) solution may be ammonia and carbon<br>
dioxide gases and their products, ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, and<br>
ammonium carbamate. Ammonia and carbon dioxide, when dissolved in water at a<br>
ratio of about 1, form a solution comprised primarily of ammonium bicarbonate and<br>
to a lesser extent the related products ammonium carbonate and ammonium<br>
carbamate. The equilibrium in this solution favors the less-soluble species of solute,<br>
ammonium bicarbonate, over the soluble species of solute, ammonium carbamate and<br>
to a lesser extent ammonium carbonate. Buffering the solution comprised primarily of<br>
ammonium bicarbonate with an excess of ammonia gas so that the ratio of ammonia<br>
to carbon dioxide increases to about 1.75 to about 2.0 will shift the equilibrium of the<br>
solution towards the soluble species of the solute, ammonium carbamate. The<br>
ammonia gas is more soluble in water and is preferentially adsorbed by the solution.<br>
Because ammonium carbamate is more readily adsorbed by the solvent of the second<br>
solution, its concentration can be increased to the point where the solvent cannot<br>
adsorb anymore of the solute, i.e. saturation. In some non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
concentration of solutes within this second solution achieved by this manipulation is<br>
greater than about 2 molal, more than about 6 molal, or about 6 to about 12 molal.<br>
Ammonia gas may be a preferred first reagent for ammonium carbamate since<br>
it is one of the chemical elements that results when the solute ammonium carbamate<br>
is decomposed, otherwise referred to as a constituent element. In general, it is<br>
preferred that the reagent for the solvent be a constituent element of the solute since<br>
any excess reagent can easily be removed from the solution when the solvent is<br>
removed, and, in a preferred embodiment the constituent element can be recycled as<br>
the first reagent. However, other reagents that can manipulate the equilibrium of the<br>
solute species in solution are contemplated so long as the reagent is easily removed<br>
from the solution and the reagent posses no health risk if trace elements of the<br>
reagent remain within the final solvent.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may generally include first and second inlets. The first and second inlets may<br>
be associated with sources of first and second solutions. In some embodiments, a<br>
source of a first solution may be a first solution reservoir and a source of a second<br>
solution may be a second solution reservoir. A first inlet may be fluidly connected to a<br>
11<br>
source of an aqueous solution to be treated, and a second inlet may be fluidly<br>
connected to a source of a draw solution. The first and second inlets may also be<br>
associated with the first and second fluid flow paths, respectively, so as to facilitate<br>
delivery of first and second solutions to the membrane module for forward osmosis.<br>
In some embodiments, the first inlet may be in fluid communication with the first fluid<br>
flow path, and the second inlet may be in fluid communication with the second fluid<br>
flow path. The first and second inlets may be fluidly isolated from one another. In at<br>
least one embodiment, the first and second inlets are positioned at one end, i.e. a first<br>
or second end, of the forward osmosis membrane module. In other embodiments, the<br>
first and second inlets may be positioned at opposite ends of the forward osmosis<br>
membran,e module.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may generally include first and second outlets. The first and second outlets<br>
may be associated with the first and second fluid flow paths, respectively, so as to<br>
facilitate removal of one or more product streams from the forward osmosis<br>
membrane module. A first outlet may collect a dilute draw solution and a second<br>
outlet may collect a depleted or concentrated aqueous process stream. In some<br>
embodiments, the first outlet may be in fluid communication with the first fluid flow<br>
path, and the second outlet may be in fluid communication with the second fluid flow<br>
path. The first and second outlets may be fluidly isolated from one another. In at least<br>
one embodiment, the first and second outlets are positioned at one end of the forward<br>
osmosis membrane module. In other embodiments, the first and second outlets may<br>
be positioned at opposite ends of the forward osmosis membrane module.<br>
In some embodiments, first and second inlets may generally be positioned at a<br>
first end of the forward osmosis membrane module while first and second outlets may<br>
generally be positioned at a second end of the forward osmosis membrane module. In<br>
some such embodiments, a distributor region may generally provide the first and<br>
second inlets, and a collector region may generally provide the first and second<br>
outlets. The distributor region may be positioned at a first end of the membrane<br>
module and the collector region may be positioned at a second end of the membrane<br>
module.<br>
12<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, the forward osmosis membrane<br>
of the module may be constructed and arranged to define a membrane compartment.<br>
A membrane compartment may generally define at least a partially enclosed space.<br>
Thus, a membrane compartment may have an interior region and an exterior region.<br>
One or more sides of a membrane compartment may be sealed. In some<br>
embodiments, a membrane compartment may generally be referred to as a membrane<br>
pocket, having an interior region and an exterior region. A first fluid flow path may be<br>
associated with the interior region of the membrane pocket and a second fluid flow<br>
path may be associated with the exterior region of the membrane pocket. The<br>
membrane pocket may generally facilitate isolation of the first and second fluid flow<br>
paths to prevent mixing, apart from desired osmotic transmembrane transport for<br>
separation. In embodiments involving an asymmetric membrane, a first layer of the<br>
membrane may provide a surface of the interior region of the compartment while a<br>
second layer of the membrane may provide a surface of the exterior region of the<br>
compartment. In some embodiments, a rejecting layer may be associated with the<br>
exterior region of the membrane pocket and a supporting layer may be associated<br>
with the interior region of the membrane pocket.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may include a plurality of forward osmosis membranes. A module may<br>
include a plurality of spirally wound forward osmosis membranes. In embodiments<br>
wherein the membranes are constructed and arranged to provide or define a<br>
membrane compartment or pocket, the module may comprise a plurality of such<br>
compartments, each having an interior region and an exterior region. A membrane<br>
module may therefore comprise a plurality of first fluid pathways and a plurality of<br>
second fluid pathways. In some embodiments, the first fluid flow pathways maybe<br>
associated with interior regions of membrane pockets, while second fluid flow<br>
pathways may be associated with exterior regions of membrane pockets, or spaces<br>
between adjacent membranes of the module. A first solution may flow along each of<br>
the first fluid pathways, and a second solution may flow along each of the second fluid<br>
pathways. Thus, a module may be scaled-up by increasing the number of forward<br>
osmosis membranes, such as spirally wound forward osmosis membranes, present in<br>
the module.<br>
13<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may include one or more features to facilitate introduction of first and second<br>
solutions to the membrane module while preventing mixing therebetween. Likewise,<br>
a forward osmosis membrane module may include one or more features to facilitate<br>
withdrawal or collection of first and second solutions from the membrane module<br>
while preventing mixing therebetween. In some embodiments, an end cap may be<br>
positioned at each end of a spiral wound membrane module. In at least one<br>
embodiment, end caps may be positioned at each end of a spirally wound membrane.<br>
In modules having a plurality of spirally wound membranes, each of the spirally<br>
wound membranes may have an end cap positioned at each end. The end cap may<br>
include at least one inlet and/or outlet in fluid communication with one or more fluid<br>
flow paths within the module. The end cap may be constructed and arranged so as to<br>
faciUtate isolation of one or more fluid flow paths within the module. The end cap may<br>
be constructed and arranged so as to isolate one or more fluid inlets and/or fluid<br>
outlets.<br>
In some embodiments, an end cap may comprise a first inlet in fluid<br>
communication with a first fluid flow path and a second inlet in fluid communication<br>
with a second fluid flow path. In one embodiment, an end cap may comprise a first<br>
inlet in fluid communication with an interior region of a membrane compartment.<br>
The end cap may comprise a second inlet in fluid communication with an exterior<br>
region of the membrane compartment.<br>
In some embodiments, an end cap may comprise a first outlet in fluid<br>
communication with a first fluid flow path and a second outlet in fluid communication<br>
with a second fluid flow path. In one embodiment, an end cap may comprise a first<br>
outlet in fluid communication with an interior region of a membrane compartment.<br>
The end cap may also include a second outlet in fluid communication with an exterior<br>
region of the membrane compartment.<br>
In other embodiments, a first end cap may include a first inlet in fluid<br>
communication with a first fluid flow path and a first outlet in fluid communication<br>
with a second fluid flow path. A second end cap may include a second inlet in fluid<br>
communication with the second fluid flow path and a second outlet in fluid<br>
communication with the first fluid flow path. The first end cap may be positioned at a<br>
14<br>
first end of a spiral wound membrane and the second end cap may be positioned at a<br>
second end of the spiral wound membrane. The first fluid flow path may be along an<br>
interior region of a membrane pocket and the second fluid flow path may be along an<br>
exterior region of the membrane pocket.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, an end cap may comprise one or<br>
more ports in fluid communication with one or more fluid flow paths of the membrane<br>
module. The ports of the end cap may generally facilitate isolation of solutions<br>
introduced to or withdrawn from the spiral wound forward osmosis membrane<br>
module at the end cap. The ports may have any structure capable of generally<br>
preventing mixing of various solutions introduced and/or withdrawn at an end cap. A<br>
port may be constructed and arranged to isolate various solutions introduced and/or<br>
withdrawn at an end cap. A port may comprise a first region in fluid communication<br>
with a first fluid flow path and a second region in fluid communication with a second<br>
fluid flow path. The first and second regions may be arranged so as to prevent mixing<br>
between solutions introduced and/or withdrawn therefrom. The ports may generally<br>
be sized and spaced so as to facilitate fluid flow through the membrane module, such<br>
as to achieve a desired flux. This flux is generally achieved by encouraging turbulent<br>
flow in a relatively straight flow path from one end of the membrane module to the<br>
other, with minimum deviation of flow path and minimum resistance to flow arising<br>
from the special dimensions of the flow path.<br>
In some embodiments, the ports may comprise tubes each having a lumen<br>
region and an exterior region. In at least one embodiment the tubes may be<br>
substantially flat tubes. Other embodiments envision oval or circular tube openings,<br>
and spaces between tubes taking rectangular, oval, triangular, or corrugated shapes,<br>
for example. One or more lumens may be fluidly connected to a first fluid flow path,<br>
such as an interior region of a membrane pocket, and an exterior region of the tubes<br>
may be in fluid communication with a second fluid flow path, such as an exterior<br>
region of the membrane pocket. The lumens may be fluidly connected to a first inlet of<br>
the membrane module to facilitate introduction of a first solution to a first flow path<br>
while the exterior region of the tubes may be fluidly connected to a second inlet of the<br>
membrane module to facilitate introduction of a second solution to a second fluid flow<br>
path. The lumens of another end cap may be fluidly connected to a first outlet of the<br>
15<br>
membrane module to facilitate withdrawal of a first solution from a first flow path<br>
while the exterior region of the tubes may be fluidly connected to a second outlet of<br>
the membrane module to facilitate withdrawal of a second solution from a second<br>
fluid flow path. In embodiments where an end cap comprises an inlet and an outlet,<br>
the lumens may be fluidly connected to a first inlet of the membrane module to deliver<br>
a first solution to a first fluid flow path while the exterior region of the tubes may be<br>
fluidly connected to a first outlet of the membrane module to withdraw a second<br>
solution from a second fluid flow path. Various other configurations apart from these<br>
example configurations are possible.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a membrane module may<br>
include one or more features to ensure isolation of fluid flow paths within the module<br>
but for desired transmembrane transport for separation. The end caps described<br>
above may be one such feature. Other features may be implemented alone or in<br>
conjunction with the end caps. In some embodiments, at least a portion of one or<br>
more ends of a spiral wound forward osmosis membrane may be mounted with a<br>
plate or other mechanical or structural approach capable of preventing mixing<br>
between various solutions supphed or withdrawn from the module. In other<br>
embodiments at least a portion of one or more ends of a spiral wound forward<br>
osmosis membrane maybe potted to facilitate isolation of fluid flow paths. Various<br>
membrane potting techniques and materials are well-known, and generally involve<br>
use of curable resin materials. In some embodiments, potting may generally prevent a<br>
fluid entering or exiting a first fluid flow path from also entering or exiting a second<br>
fluid flow path, and vice versa. For example, potting may prevent a first fluid flowing<br>
into lumens of end cap tubes from also flowing in between the tubes. Likewise,<br>
potting may generally prevent a second fluid flowing between end cap tubes from also<br>
flowing into lumens of the end cap tubes. In some non-hmiting embodiments, this<br>
may be achieved with any epoxy-like substance that is liquid and then solidifies. Some<br>
potting materials are characterized as being generally rigid while others are more<br>
flexible. Each property has associated benefits and, in some embodiments, it may be<br>
desirable to use a combination of resin materials for potting. In embodiments where<br>
an end cap and/or plate or other mechanical or structural device is used, potting may<br>
16<br>
offer supplemental protection against undesirable mixing at fluid inlets and/or outlets<br>
of a spirally wound forward osmosis membrane module.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane<br>
module may generally be constructed and arranged to promote uniform flux through<br>
the membrane module, such as along a longitudinal axis of the module. A uniform flux<br>
may generally promote efficient use of available membrane surface area. Design<br>
considerations which may promote uniform flux include optimization of parameters<br>
such as, for example, flow rate, stream turbulence, balancing of the concentrations and<br>
volumes of the feed and draw solutions, flow channel height, patterning on the<br>
membrane surface, flow distributors or supplementary flow distributers at either end<br>
of the membrane module to ensure even flow throughout the channels at any point on<br>
the radial axis of the module, and the diameter and length of the membrane module.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a support structure may be<br>
associated with the spirally wound membrane module. For example, a rod or shaft<br>
may support a spirally wound membrane. In some embodiments, one or more<br>
forward osmosis membranes may be wrapped around a support structure. In certain<br>
embodiments, one or more forward osmosis membrane pockets, such as a plurality,<br>
may be spiraled around a support structure. The one or more membranes may be<br>
connected to the support structure. In other embodiments, they may be unattached.<br>
In some embodiments, the module does not include a permeate tube, such as a central<br>
permeate tube, for introduction or collection of one or more fluid streams. Thus, in at<br>
least one embodiment, the support structure is not a permeate tube.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, one or more spacers may be<br>
positioned along one or more fluid flow paths. Spacers may generally facihtate<br>
promotion of uniform flux along fluid flow paths, may direct fluid flow along flow<br>
paths, and may promote any desirable turbulence within the module. One or more<br>
spacers may be positioned along a First fluid flow path and/or a second fluid flow path.<br>
In some embodiments, spacers may be positioned along a membrane pocket and/or<br>
along an exterior region of a membrane pocket. In at least some embodiments,<br>
spacers may be positioned between adjacent membranes of a membrane module.<br>
Spacers may be used to strategically adjust one or more parameters associated with a<br>
fluid flow path. For example, the dimensions, such as thickness, width or height of<br>
17<br>
spacers may be selected so as to result in a desired height, volume, flux or other<br>
parameter of a fluid flow path. It may be desirable to vary one or more parameters of<br>
a fluid flow path along a longitudinal axis of a fluid flow path. In at least one<br>
embodiment, the thickness of spacers along a longitudinal axis of the membrane<br>
module may be varied to achieve a desired profile. For example, it may be desirable to<br>
taper one or more fluid flow paths along a longitudinal axis of a module.<br>
In at least one embodiment, a spirally wound forward osmosis membrane<br>
module does not include glue Unes or is substantially free of glue lines. Use of glue<br>
lines is commonly known to generally facilitate direction of fluid flow within a<br>
membrane module. In some embodiments, a forward osmosis membrane, such as one<br>
folded or otherwise constructed and arranged to form a compartment or pocket, does<br>
not include a glue line along a fluid flow path, such as to direct fluid flow. For example,<br>
some embodiments may not include a glue line associated with an interior region of a<br>
membrane pocket. One or more such membranes without glue lines may be spirally<br>
wound within a forward osmosis membrane module in accordance with one or more<br>
embodiments. In some embodiments, glue or adhesive may still be used along the<br>
edges of a membrane pocket so as to seal the pocket, secure end caps and/or to<br>
connect the membrane to a support structure.<br>
A spirally wound membrane module in accordance with one or more<br>
embodiments may be used in pressure retarded osmosis. Pressure retarded osmosis<br>
may generally relate to deriving osmotic power or salinity gradient energy from a salt<br>
concentration difference between two solutions, such as a concentrated draw solution<br>
and a dilute working fluid. In some examples, seawater may be a first solution and<br>
fresh water or nearly deionized water may be a second solution. In some<br>
embodiments, one or more spirally wound forward osmosis membrane modules may<br>
be enclosed in a pressure vessel to facilitate pressure retarded osmosis. One or more<br>
design aspects of the forward osmosis membrane module, such as one or more<br>
characteristics or parameters pertaining to the membranes, end caps, spacers or flow<br>
paths, may be modified for pressure retarded osmotic use. Within pressure retarded<br>
osmosis, a draw solution may be introduced into a pressure chamber on a first side of<br>
a membrane, such as along a first fluid flow path of a spirally wound membrane<br>
module. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the draw solution may be<br>
18<br>
pressurized based on an osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and a<br>
dilute working fluid. The dilute working fluid may be introduced on a second side of<br>
the membrane, such as along a second fluid flow path of the spirally wound membrane<br>
module. The dilute working fluid may generally move across the membrane via<br>
osmosis, thus increasing the volume on the pressurized draw solution side of the<br>
membrane. As the pressure is compensated, a turbine may be spun to generate<br>
electricity. A resulting dilute draw solution may then be processed, such as separated,<br>
for reuse. In some embodiments, a lower-temperature heat source, such as industrial<br>
waste heat may be used in or facilitate a pressure retarded osmosis system or process.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment, a pressure retarded osmosis system<br>
incorporating one or more spirally wound membrane modules may be an osmotic<br>
heat engine, such as that described in WIPO Publication No. WO2008/060435 to<br>
McGinnis et al. which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all<br>
purposes. An osmotic heat engine may convert thermal energy into mechanical work<br>
using a semi-permeable membrane to convert osmotic pressure into electrical power.<br>
A concentrated ammonia-carbon dioxide draw solution may create high osmotic<br>
pressures which generate water flux through a semi-permeable membrane against a<br>
hydraulic pressure gradient. Depressurization of the increased draw solution volume<br>
in a turbine may produce electrical power. The process may be maintained in steady<br>
state operation through the separation of diluted draw solution into a re-concentrated<br>
draw solution and deionized water working fluid, both fore reuse in the osmotic heat<br>
engine.<br>
In some embodiments, a forward osmosis module may be operated at<br>
pressures up to about 2000 psi. Some non-limiting forward osmosis embodiments<br>
may involve pressures between about 20 psi to about 50 psi. In operation, nonlimiting<br>
example conditions for a forward osmosis module may include about a 5<br>
molar draw solution with no hydraulic pressure exerted on it other than the about 20<br>
psi to about 40 psi needed to carry out crossflow through the draw solution flow<br>
channel, which is diluted to a concentration of approximately about 1.5 molar by the<br>
transmembrane flux of water from the feed solution through the semipermeable<br>
membrane. The feed solution in this case would for example be a seawater feed<br>
19<br>
(approximately about 0.5 molar] which is not pressurized hydraulically other than to<br>
about 20 psi to about 40 psi to Induce its crossflow through the feed flow channel.<br>
In some embodiments, a pressure retarded osmosis module may be operated at<br>
pressures up to about 2000 psi. Some non-Umiting pressure retarded osmosis<br>
embodiments may involve pressures between about 1000 psi and about 2000 psi. In<br>
operation, non-limiting example conditions for a pressure retarded osmosis module<br>
may include a draw solution concentration of about 5 molar becoming diluted to<br>
about 3 molar, under a hydraulic pressure of approximately about 100 atm. The feed<br>
solution in this case would for example be a deionized water working fluid under only<br>
the hydraulic pressure (about 20 psi to about 40 psi) needed to induce its flow<br>
through the feed flow channel.<br>
FIG. 1 presents a spiral wound forward osmosis membrane module 100 in<br>
accordance with one or more non-limiting embodiments. Module 100 includes a<br>
plurality of spirally wound forward osmosis membranes 110. Each end of the module<br>
100 includes a chamber 120,130. Chamber 120 includes inlets 124,126 while<br>
chamber 130 includes outlets 134,136. Each end of the membranes 110 is potted in<br>
pots 140.<br>
Module 100 may be sized with any desired dimensions. For example, sizing<br>
may be based on various factors including flow rate requirements and available<br>
footprint space. Modules may generally be scaled up or down to accommodate<br>
specifications of a particular apphcation. In some non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
physical dimensions of module 100 may be between about 0.5 meters and about 2<br>
meters in length. In one specific embodiment, module 100 may be about 1 meter in<br>
length. In some non-limiting embodiments, module 100 may be between about 1 inch<br>
and about 50 inches in diameter. In some specific embodiments, module 100 may be<br>
about 2, about 4, about 8 or about 16 inches in diameter.<br>
FIG. 2 presents a schematic of a single forward osmosis membrane 210<br>
unwound or prior to spiral winding. A plurality of such membranes 210 may<br>
comprise the membranes 110 of FIG. 1. An end cap 250 is positioned at each end of<br>
forward osmosis membrane 210. In some non-limiting embodiments, an end cap may<br>
be designed in accordance with end cap 350 presented in FIG. 3. End cap 350 may<br>
include a row of ports 370, separated by spaces 380 in-between. In some<br>
20<br>
embodiments, ports 370 may be flat tubes. An attachment structure or manifold 360<br>
may facilitate sealing of end cap 350 to the side of membrane 210. The dimensions of<br>
ports 370, spaces 380 and manifold 360 may be of any desired measurements and<br>
may be separately optimized.<br>
A side view of an end cap 450 is presented in FIG. 4. Manifold 460 may<br>
generally facilitate attachment of end cap 450 to a membrane pocket. In operation, a<br>
first fluid may flow through the end cap 450 only through lumens 475 of the flat tubes<br>
470. A second fluid may flow within space 480 around flat tubes 470. FIG. 5 details a<br>
cross-section of an end cap 550 in which flat tube 570 interfaces with manifold 560.<br>
Manifold 560 may be sealed to a membrane pocket. An internal portion of manifold<br>
560 may be in fluid communication with lumens of tubes 570 and with an interior<br>
region of the membrane pocket, while an external portion of manifold 560 may be in<br>
fluid communication with space 580 around tubes 570 and with an exterior region of<br>
the membrane pocket. Thus, first and second fluid inlets may be isolated from one<br>
another to prevent mixing as illustrated in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 illustrates an end of a spiral<br>
wound forward osmosis membrane module 600. Tubes 670 of end cap 650 define<br>
lumens 675 and exterior regions 680. A first fluid may enter module 600 at first inlet<br>
624 which is in fluid communication with lumens 675. A second fluid may enter<br>
module 600 at second inlet 626 in fluid communication with exterior regions 680.<br>
Potting 640 may facilitate fluid isolation of first and second inlets 624, 626. Fluid flow<br>
paths defined by the interior and exterior regions of the membrane pocket may also<br>
be fluidly isolated, apart from desired transmembrane transport for osmotic<br>
separation as illustrated in FIG. 7. FIG. 7 illustrates a membrane pocket with a first<br>
fluid flow path of Solution A along its exterior region and a second fluid flow path of<br>
Solution B along its interior region.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, a flat sheet membrane may be<br>
used in the production of a spiral wound forward osmosis membrane module. In<br>
some non-limiting embodiments, a flat sheet forward osmosis membrane may be<br>
folded upon itself, such as substantially in half. A first edge of a membrane sheet may<br>
be folded to a second parallel edge of the membrane sheet. In the case of an<br>
asymmetric forward osmosis membrane, the sheet may be folded such that a<br>
supporting layer of one side faces the supporting layer of the other, and the rejecting<br>
21<br>
layer of each side faces out. A pocket or compartment may generally be formed out of<br>
the folded membrane. In another embodiment, active layers may face one another in<br>
the interior region of the membrane pocket. Other arrangements of backing and<br>
active layers are also possible. A naturally sealed edge of the compartment is formed<br>
via the folding operation. An edge opposite and parallel to the naturally sealed edge<br>
may be sealed by any commonly know^n technique including use of glue, epoxy,<br>
adhesive or friction. The two ends of the folded membrane may also be substantially<br>
sealed, as described below, while providing fluidly isolated inlets and outlets. In other<br>
embodiments, two or more membrane sheets may be attached to form a membrane<br>
compartment, rather than folding a single sheet.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, an end cap may be placed on<br>
each of the two end edges of the folded membrane sheet (the edges which are<br>
normally at either end of a spiral wound housing) in order to achieve separate flow of<br>
feed and draw solutions through the module. The lengthwise sides of the end cap may<br>
generally be sealed. The lengthwise side which will be in the center of the spiral<br>
bundle upon rolling may be optionally affixed to a bar or other internal structural<br>
support for the winding of the sheet. Any known technique may be used to seahngly<br>
attach an end cap to each of the end edges of the folded forward osmosis membrane<br>
sheet. One or more turbulence spacers may be included in the interior of the<br>
membrane pocket.<br>
The resulting modified folded forward osmosis membrane sheet, including end<br>
caps, may be wound into a spiral. At this point, the wound membrane may have the<br>
flat tubes from the end caps protruding from either end of the wound membrane<br>
bundle. These ends may then be potted. In some embodiments, each end may be<br>
dipped in an epoxy or other form of sealant. In one non-limiting embodiment,<br>
approximately half of the length of the tubes may be sealed in this manner. The ends<br>
of the epoxy sealings may then be cut after potting to allow fluid flow into the lumens<br>
of the tubes. In some non-limiting embodiments, approximately a quarter of the<br>
length of the tubes may remain sealed.<br>
Each end of the membrane bundle may then be mounted or sealed inside an<br>
exterior housing. During operation, feed solution such as brine or seawater may be<br>
directed into the space in-between the epoxy block and the main sheet winding,<br>
22<br>
flowing around the ports into the housing and along the seawater side of the<br>
membrane. Likewise, draw solution may be directed into the open ends of the ports,<br>
flowing into the membrane housing and along the draw solution side of the<br>
membrane. This configuration may allow for similar fluid dynamics on both sides of<br>
the osmotic membrane.<br>
A system, such as a desalination or other treatment system, may include a<br>
plurality of spirally wound forward osmosis membrane modules. A plurality of<br>
spirally wound forward osmosis membrane modules may be arranged in an array. A<br>
system may include a plurality of inlets and outlets. A source of first and second<br>
solutions may be fluidly connected to the membrane module(s) such as a source of a<br>
feed solution and a source of a draw solution. In some embodiments, a separation<br>
system, such as a distillation system, may be fluidly connected to an outlet of the<br>
membrane module. The separation system may treat a dilute draw solution produced<br>
by the forward osmosis process to produce potable water or other product stream as<br>
well as to recover the draw solution. The draw solution may then be recycled back to<br>
an inlet of the forward osmosis membrane module[s) while the product water may be<br>
delivered to a point of use. Distillation columns, such as those described in WIPO<br>
Publication No. WO 2007/146094 to McGinnis et al. which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes, may be implemented in accordance<br>
with various embodiments.<br>
In accordance with one or more embodiments, devices, systems and methods<br>
may generally involve a controller for adjusting or regulating at least one operating<br>
parameter of the device or a component of the system, such as, but not limited to,<br>
actuating valves and pumps, as well as adjusting a property or characteristic of one or<br>
more fluid flow streams through the spirally wound forward osmosis membrane<br>
module. A controller may be in electronic communication with at least one sensor<br>
configured to detect at least one operational parameter of the system, such as a<br>
concentration, flow rate, pH level or temperature. The controller may be generally<br>
configured to generate a control signal to adjust one or more operational parameters<br>
in response to a signal generated by a sensor. For example, the controller can be<br>
configured to receive a representation of a condition, property, or state of any stream,<br>
component or subsystem of a forward osmosis separation device. The controller<br>
23<br>
typically includes an algorithm that facilitates generation of at least one output signal<br>
which is typically based on one or more of any of the representation and a target or<br>
desired value such as a set point. In accordance with one or more particular aspects,<br>
the controller can be configured to receive a representation of any measured property<br>
of any stream, and generate a control, drive or output signal to any of the system<br>
