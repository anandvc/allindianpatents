				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to self-lubricating carbon-graphite thrust collar and thrust pad of thrust bearing assemblies.<br>
Background of invention with regard to the drawback associated with prior art:<br>
Thrust bearing is a bearing designed to operate with loading only on its axis with normal flat contact or tilting contact actions between two flat faces. An automotive clutch release bearing is an example of a specialized thrust bearing and the self-lubricating carbon-graphite flat face or faces with an opposite flat face or faces, in submersible pump are example of numerous types of thrust bearings.<br>
Basically, in a thrust bearing assembly, both the thrust collar and thrust pad mean the same. Actually it is a single component with two different names, depending upon the assembly direction of the thrust bearing. The difference in the name is only to indicate the different manner in which they are fixed to the submersible pump or any other mechanical device. If the thrust bearing part, which holds the self-lubricating carbon-graphite, is fixed on the top, it is termed as thrust collar and if fixed at the bottom by a vertical flip, it is termed as thrust pad.<br>
Thrust bearing assemblies with self-lubricating carbon-graphite fixed to thrust collar and thrust pad are used in numerous mechanical devices including submersible pumps. Submersible pump is being used as a perfect example for the numerous advantages of invention of this process, in this document, as against the drawbacks and disadvantages in the existing process.<br>
The thrust bearing assembly plays a very critical role in the submersible pumps and other mechanical devices, as an alternative to regular bearings. The regular bearings require external lubricants, such as oil and grease, which tend to get washed away in the water, as submersible pumps work in water, and cannot take the severe thrust pressure that they are subjected to, during deep submersible pump operations, rendering them to fail totally. On the contrary Carbon-graphite thrust bearings are self-lubricating, not requiring external lubricating greases or oils and accommodating the thrust impacts, operate with loading only on its axis, making them the most-fit bearing types for submersible pumps. In the existing process, the self-lubricating carbon-graphite is externally bonded to the thrust collar and the thrust pad to form the crucial part of the thrust bearing assembly and in tum, making it the critical part of the thrust bearing assembly of submersible pumps or other numerous mechanical devices. Thus the thrust bearing assemblies are the lifelines of the submersible pumps and other numerous mechanical devices.<br>
According to this process, this is a single and simple process, directly moulding self-lubricating carbon-graphite on thrust collar and thrust pad by extending the mould into mould extension space and spaces, created on the surface or surfaces of the thrust collar and the thrust pad, to facilitate a compact and strong self-adhering self-lubricating carbon-graphite extended moulding, by various moulding processes. Thus eliminating the drawbacks, numerous manual and imperfect processes and preventing wastages, with either nil or negligible carbon-graphite bonding failures and increased quality, quantity and highly cost-effective uniform productions, in total contrast to the existing technique.<br><br>
Existing technique:<br>
Self-lubricating Carbon-graphite, either individually or in their various combinations with or without additive or with various additives, as per their required physical, chemical and mechanical properties, in different required shapes, are either moulded separately or cut, machined and machine finished, from pre-moulded solids, rods, squares, round tubes, square tubes or other solid or other tubular shapes of the above carbon-graphite moulds, to form dry lubricating part of the thrust bearing assembly in submersible pumps.<br>
Then the above, finished self-lubricating carbon-graphite part is externally bonded with different kinds of adhesives or resins, to adhere them to the thrust collar or the thrust pad to form the crucial part of thrust bearing assemblies, which in turn form crucial parts of submersible pumps.<br>
The thrust collar and the thrust pad, usually consist of metals or metal alloys or their castings cast by various methods, or other material or other materials or their combinations, which are again generally either cut or forged or machined or machine finished or without any machining, or mould cast in different sizes and shapes as required.<br>
Each individual self-lubricating carbon-graphite part has to be machined individually, both to the pre and post external adhesive bonding to the thrust collar and the thrust pad, where each individual thrust collar and thrust pad, is individually externally bonded to the self-lubricating carbon-graphite part, with individual fasteners for compaction, during each individual bonding.<br>
Drawbacks of the existing technique:<br>
The failures of the thrust bearing assemblies manufactured by the existing technique are very high as the technique is highly risky. The entire process of external bonding is manual and with no guarantee of self-lubricating carbon-graphite bonding to the thrust collar and the thrust pad of the thrust bearing assembly against abnormally high rates of bonding failures.<br>
The very name " thrust bearing assembly " operating with loading only on its axis, explains the function that it has to undergo severe thrust pressure during the operations of the submersible pumps, which can again render the self-lubricating carbon-graphite adhesive bonding to split or break off, from the thrust collar and thrust pad of the assembly frequently. Thus frequent failures of thrust bearing assemblies, in turn, the frequent failures of submersible pumps create heavy agricultural, financial and industrial losses, both to the end user and to the nation.<br>
The percentage of failures in thrust bearing assemblies is, at times about 30%. The failure, painstakingly and mercilessly results in the total replacement of the thrust bearing assembly and which can be done only by removing the submersible pump from the well, at times even up to a 1000 feet below the ground, for which the entire pipe line has to be removed as the submersible pump lies at the bottom of the well fixed to the bottom end of the pipe line, where the time consumption to rectify the failure can run even up to a few days with costly replacement process incurring further agricultural, industrial losses and inconveniences for common man.<br>
The existing technique also increases the production time dramatically and highly escalates the manufacturing cost as numerous undesired processes are involved.<br><br>
Self-lubricating carbon-graphite pre-cast moulds have to undergo machining, external bonding to the thrust collar and the thrust pad, and again machining, post to the external bonding process. Both these pre and post machining processes add to losses of up to 50% of self-lubricating carbon-graphite material when machined from pre-cast solids or tubular moulds in the existing technique and require added investments for additional machineries, tools and space requirements.<br>
Furthermore, the existing technique adds further to the cost escalation, by additional laborers, additional energy, adhesive or resin bonding, protective materials to prevent the damages to carbon-graphite during the adhesive bonding, adhesive costs and fasteners for compact adhering during the adhesive bonding process, as the processes are purely manual.<br>
The production rate is extremely slow, as each individual self-lubricating carbon-graphite part has to be machined individually both to the pre and post adhesive bonding process and each individual thrust collar and thrust pad, has to be individually externally adhesive bonded to the carbon-graphite part with individual fasteners for compact adhering each bonding. Hence this existing technique, rendering every stage of production manual, is extremely slow in production, with huge variations in specifications and with very high rejections. And with all the above risks and complications, the percentage of failure is dramatically high, with added goodwill damages and losses to the submersible pump manufacturers and losses, sufferings and agony to end users.<br>
During dry run of the pump, undesired heat is generated on the self-lubricating carbon-graphite, which in turn heats the thin layer of adhesive, bonding the self-lubricating carbon-graphite to the thrust collar and the thrust pad. This results in expansions of carbon-graphite and the adhesive, and the expansions are unequal, as both the materials have different properties. This unequal expansion causes the adhesive layer to develop cracks, thereby the adhesive bonding breaks off releasing the self-lubricating carbon graphite, again rendering the thrust bearing to fail. The best of the adhesives and resins fail under high temperature conditions and lose their bonding properties. As the bonding adhesive is in direct contact with the self-lubricating carbon-graphite, the transfer of heat is maximized on the adhesive, rendering it to crack and lose its bonding properties due to the heat. The thrust collar and the thrust pad material can absorb the heat and permit smooth heat escape from the self-lubricating carbon-graphite, if they are in direct contact to the self-lubricating carbon-graphite. But the bonding adhesive layer acts as a barrier for the smooth escape of the heat. Thus the externally bonded adhesive or resin layer in-between the self-lubricating carbon-graphite and the thrust collar or thrust pad is a big drawback and destructive, acting as a barrier for the escape of heat, failing the thrust bearing completely during dry run of submersible pump.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Object of invention:<br>
The principal object of this new process is a single and highly advantageous simple process, ensuring that either nil or negligible failures occur in submersible pumps due to the external bonding failures of self-lubricating carbon-graphite to the thrust collar and the thrust pad of the thrust bearing assembly, eliminating the drawbacks, material wastages and numerous complicated and imperfect processes with the existing process of externally self-lubricating carbon-graphite adhesive bonding to the thrust collar and thrust pad in the thrust bearing assembly, and keep the submersible pumps alive and pouring.<br>
Another object of this invention is to bring down the manufacturing costs of the thrust bearing assembly and produce uniform quality and quantity with either nil or negligible rejections, eliminating all the costly complicated numerous imperfect manual processes, material wastages and associated drawbacks and increasing the life even during the dry run of the pumps.<br>
A further object of this invention is to produce lower trouble and maintenance in the submersible pumps, saving precious time and money, reaping bumper crops to the farmer, happiness to common man, increased industrial production and minimize hardships to the end user of submersible pumps, rendering further success to submersible pump industry while contributing to the progress and prosperity of farmers, common man, industries and economy of the nation.<br>
A summary of invention:<br>
This invention is a single and simple process, directly moulding self-lubricating carbon-graphite on thrust collar and thrust pad of the thrust bearing assembly by extending the mould into mould extension space and spaces, or in-between protrusions, created on the surface or surfaces of the thrust collar and the thrust pad, to facilitate a compact and strong self-adhering extended self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulding, by various moulding processes. Thus completely eliminating the existing complicated process of external adhesive bonding of self-lubricating carbon-graphite to the thrust collar and thrust pad and the drawbacks associated with numerous imperfect manual and time consuming processes and preventing wastages, with either nil or negligible carbon-graphite bonding failures and increased quality, quantity, time saving and cost-effective uniform productions, at the same time securing additional life of thrust bearings even during dry running of the pumps.<br>

Figure 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28, the cross sections of the thrust collar and thrust pad, post to the direct moulding of self-lubricating carbon-graphite onto the surface and surfaces of the thrust collar and thrust pad, shows the mould extending into the mould extension space and spaces created on the surface and surfaces of the thrust collar and the thrust pad, with a strong and compact adherence along with the desired self-lubricating carbon-graphite mould, as per this process.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
This new process involves extended moulding self-lubricating carbon-graphite, either individually or in their various combinations, with or without additive or with various additives, as per their required physical, chemical and mechanical properties, directly on to the thrust collar and the thrust pad of the thrust bearing assembly, by various moulding processes in a moulding die.<br>
The thrust collar and thrust pad is made of or usually consists of metal or metals or metal alloys or metal alloy castings or other material or other materials or their combinations, cast by various methods, or by milling and machining, which are again generally either cut or forged or machined or machine finished or without any machining, or mould cast, in different sizes and shapes as required.<br><br>
Mould extension space or spaces are created on the surface or surfaces of the thrust collar and the thrust pad, by drilling an angular hole or angular holes, or by creating an angular groove or angular grooves, the grooves being either circular or straight or in any other size, shape, angle and form, or by creating other types of mold extension space and spaces in different forms, shapes, sizes, forms and angles, or by casting or machining metal or metal alloys with the above mould space cavity or cavities, or by providing protruding extensions in different shapes or forms, on the surface or surfaces of the thrust collar and the thrust pad, so as to provide mould extension space either inside or on the surface or surfaces of the thrust collar and the thrust pad, or by creating mould extension space by any other method or methods, to facilitate the mould extension into these mould extension space. The purpose of providing these mould extension space or spaces on the thrust collar and the thrust pad is to facilitate the extension of the self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulding into the created mould extension space or spaces, or in-between the protrusions, created on the surface and surfaces of the thrust collar and the thrust pad after their insertion as insert or inserts in the mould die, during the self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulding by various moulding processes, along with the actually required self-lubricating carbon-graphite mould. A few types of created mould extension space and spaces, of the numerous possible, on the surface or surfaces of the thrust collar and thrust pad for a strong and compact self-adhering of self-lubricating carbon-graphite to the thrust collar and the thrust pad, in their cross sections, are shown as appearing in figures 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 in the drawing sheets.<br>
The moulding die is provided with both, the thrust collar or thrust pad insert cavity or cavities and the required self-lubricating carbon-graphite mould cavity. The thrust collar and thrust pad, is inserted into the moulding die, as an insert or inserts, for which insert cavity or cavities are provided in the moulding die along with the self-lubricating carbon-graphite mould, for the moulding process by various moulding processes.<br>
Once the insert or inserts created with different kinds of mould extension space or spaces, is inserted in the moulding die, the actual self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulding process is started, by any of the various moulding processes. The self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulding takes place in moulding die, directly on the thrust collar or thrust pad insert or inserts by various moulding processes. During this process the self-lubricating carbon-graphite mould takes not only the actual desired external mould size and shape required for the thrust bearing assembly, but it also extends in the extension mould space and spaces created on the surface and surfaces of the thrust collar and thrust pad or extends in-between the angular or different kinds of protruding extensions created on the surface or surfaces of the thrust collar or thrust pad. Thereby, forming a strong and compact adhering the entire self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulded material firmly and strongly to the thrust collar and the thrust pad by the mould extension, without any involvement of external adhesive or resin bonding. Thus ensuring the self-lubricating carbon-graphite mould to stay strongly and compactly self-adhered with the thrust collar and the thrust pad, and not come off or sheer off from the thrust collar and thrust pad, even during severe thrust pressure and dry running of the pumps. A few types of mould extensions, among numerous possible, created after the completion of extended self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulding along with the desired self-lubricating carbon-graphite moulding bearing a strong and compact adhering of the self-lubricating carbon-graphite to the thrust collar and the thrust pad, are shown in<br><br>
their cross sections as appearing in drawing figures 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 in the drawing sheets.<br>
The part numbers and their descriptive matter, respectively, marked on the figures in the drawing sheets are as follows:<br>
