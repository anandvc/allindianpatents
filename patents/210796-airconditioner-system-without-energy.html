				<td>COMPLETE SPECIFICATIONS OF A AIR CONDITIONER SYSTEM WITHOUT ENERGY<br>
Air Conditioning System<br>
Background<br>
Most of the cooling apparatus all over the world use some gases and electricity to cool down a room or a cold storage. Unfortunately the use of these gases is very bad for mankind because these gases- cause depletion of ozone layer that surrounds the earth and prevents dangerous rays from sun to reach earth. Depletion of ozone layer allows dangerous rays from sun to reach earth and can cause cancer in human body.<br>
Method, which is proposed in this application, does not use these gases at all. Moreover it does not even require electrical energy for cooling.<br>
By the use of this novel device and method not only the mankind is saved from the deadly diseases, a lot of energy is also saved.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An object of this invention is to provide an air conditioning system, which does not utilize any of the harmful gases and can run without electricity. Another object of this invention is to provide an apparatus and method for operating an air conditioning system having a network of pipes and a cooling fluid. Still another object of this invention is to provide an air conditioning system having a unique physical size whereby the system can replace the electrically operated air conditioning system. Still another object is to provide an air conditioning system that is easier to maintain and repair.<br>
The characteristic of this invention is that it utilizes a plurality of pipes structures and a cooling fluid to sufficiently bring down the temperature of ambient air.<br>
This is an air-conditioning system in which no gases are required and power is required only for circulation and not for cooling. Accordingly, there is provided an air conditioning system characterized in that it comprises a liquid tank (1) connected to an outer pipe (2) having at least two branch pipes (7) &amp; (8); an inner pipe (3) which is placed inside the outer pipe (2) thereby creating an air-space (9) so that the air can move from one end of the outer pipe to the other end of the outer pipe; the inner pipe (3) having numerous capillary tubes placed around it, wherein the outer portion of the inner pipe (3) is cooled by the capillary action of the rising fluid inside the capillary tubes and the air which is sucked from branch pipe (7) &amp; (8) also gets cooled as it moves the cold outer surface of the inner pipe (3) through the air-passage (9).<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Fig 1. Represents a diagrammatic representation of the Air Conditioning system of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
Fig 1 shows a systematic diagram of the air conditioning system in conformity with the invention. The air conditioning system comprises a liquid tank (1) at the lowest most point which is filled with the cooling fluid i.e. ethyl alcohol having a freezing point of-115° C. The liquid tank is connected with an outer pipe (2) having two branch pipes (7) &amp; (8) for inlet of warm air to be cooled. Pipe 7 will be inlet for air from the room that is to be air-conditioned and pipe 8 will be inlet for air from outside, and both will pass through the liquid tank (1) before joining outer pipe (2). The outer pipe (2) has an inner pipe (3), which is substantially concentric to the outer pipe and provides for a narrow air-passage (9), through which the cooled air can move from one end to the outer end.<br>
The inner pipe (3) is a metal pipe and is made up of any metal that is good conductor of heat preferably copper or aluminum. The inner pipe (3) will have a inner diameter of 2-7/8" and around this numerous capillary tubes (4) placed. The gap between these capillary tubes and outer pipe will have a gap of about ½" which will be air-space (9). The inner pipe (3) will have a hollow space (10) in the centre of the pipe through which the liquid from atop the capillary tubes will be allowed to naturally fall through back into the liquid tank (1).<br>
Every capillary tube will have a hole just above the lower end. The hole in the capillary tube (11) is controlled by lever (12) as shown in the drawing. The lower end of the capillary tubes will rest inside liquid storage tank (1). Lever (12) will control the opening and closing of the hole at the bottom of the capillary tubes.<br>
At the top of the Pipe (2), the pipe will turn angular in which a fan (6) will reside.<br>
The liquid from the tank (1) gets sucked into capillary tubes (4) and goes upward and reaches the top of the pipe. The cooling liquid i.e. ethyl alcohol, inside the capillary tubes, when it reaches the top of the inner pipe (3) it again falls back to the liquid tank (1) through the central hole (10) and thus completes the cycle. When the liquid moves through the capillary tubes, it gets cooled because the energy is taken from liquid to move upward in the capillary tube. Therefore the liquid gets cooler as it moves up in the capillary tube and as a result cools the inner pipe (3). Now when the fan (6) is switched on, the air is sucked from the room through branch pipe (7) &amp; (8) and since the inner pipe (3) is at a very low temperature because of the capillary tube, the air passing through the air-passage (9) gets in touch with the cold pipe and exchanges the heat resulting into a cold stream of air which is again circulated in the room through fan (6).<br>
Once in a while when the hole at the bottom of the capillary tube (11) is opened by lever (12), all the cold liquid in the tube falls into the tank (1), thus lowering the temperature of the liquid in the tank. When pipes (7) and (8) first passes through the tank (1), the air contacts with cool liquid; thereafter as it gets sucked upward from fan (6), it contacts with colder inner pipe (3) and hence throws out cold air back into the room through passage (6).<br>
Hence, warm air pulled into the system contacts with the cool liquid in the tank and then passes through the outer pipe wherein it contacts with cold capillary tubes, resulting in cooler air being thrown out from the top of the apparatus after being pulled by the fan.<br>
NOTE:<br>
1.	Efficiency of a system will be directly proportionate to the number of capillary tubes.<br>
2.	In the beginning we may have only 500-1000 capillary tubes<br>
