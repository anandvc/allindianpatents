				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF POWDERS FROM SLURRIES OF<br>
FRAGRANCED AMINOPLAST CAPSULES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the perfume and consumer product industries. It<br>
concerns more particularly a process for producing powders out of slurries of aminoplast,<br>
and more particularly melamine-formaldehyde, capsules containing fragrances and other<br>
hydrophobic materials. The invention also relates to the powder products thus obtained,<br>
which have novel physical and chemical characteristics, and to the use of such powders in<br>
consumer products. The consumer products containing such powders of melamine-<br>
formaldehyde capsules are also an object of the invention.<br>
Background Art<br>
The literature is rich in reports of the use of melamine-formaldehyde resins for the<br>
encapsulation of active substances and mentions in particular the potential use of such<br>
encapsulation systems in perfumery and cosmetic applications. Therefore, amino resin<br>
based capsules, also commonly designated as aminoplast capsules, are the subject of a<br>
variety of literature reports and patent applications relating to the perfumery and cosmetic<br>
industries. In practice, these polymers are capable of forming a protecting shell around the<br>
active ingredient that one wishes to protect, thus providing an encapsulation system<br>
characterised by its water-insolubility. The active ingredient protected by the capsule may<br>
be released through mechanical rupture of the microcapsules, which become brittle when<br>
dry.<br>
Some of the typical examples of this type of applications can be found in the<br>
following patent documents, but the person skilled in the art will no doubt have<br>
knowledge of many other reported applications of fragranced aminoplast capsules in<br>
consumer products.<br>
US 5,137,646 describes coated perfume particles for use in fabric softeners and<br>
antistatic agents and US 6,620,777 claims improved deposition of fragranced aminoplast<br>
microcapsules on fabric from liquid fabric softeners by adding cationic polymers.<br><br>
US 4,145,184 claims granular and liquid laundry detergent compositions<br>
comprising fragranced microcapsules.<br>
US 6.248,703 discloses soap bar and detergent bar compositions comprising<br>
melamine capsules that contain essential oils.<br>
WO 03/089561 describes the use of fragranced microcapsules in fabric refresher<br>
aerosols.<br>
The use of such fragranced aminoplast capsules in liquid formulations for<br>
household and cosmetic applications is also known for example from US Patent<br>
5,188,754, assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble, which describes detergent compositions<br>
containing perfumes in the form of friable microcapsules. US Patent 5,137,646, also to<br>
Procter &amp; Gamble, describes the preparation and use of perfumed aminoplast particles<br>
which are stable in fluid compositions such as fabric softeners. However, this<br>
composition requires a two-step manufacturing process where the perfume is firstly<br>
solidified with a meltable polymer, followed by grinding of the solidified perfume and<br>
coating with the aminoplast resin.<br>
The technical advantage of such friable aminoplast microcapsules is that they are<br>
water insoluble and resistant to heat. As a result, the fragrance or other hydrophobic<br>
substance remains fully encapsulated when capsules are dispersed in aqueous<br>
formulations and during laundering processes for example. The fragrance is mainly<br>
released by mechanical manipulation of the dry target surface such as skin, hair or fabric.<br>
A general range of encapsulate concentration, namely fragrance content, of the<br>
microcapsules slurry is between 1 and 50%, by weight, relative to the weight of the<br>
slurry, the latter also containing typically 4 to 20% by weight of encapsulating shell<br>
material in a free form, and the balance being water.<br>
The general process for the preparation of aminoplast microcapsules containing<br>
encapsulated fragrances or other hydrophobic materials is also a well-known state of the<br>
art and is widely described in the patent literature. Early examples of the latter are<br>
represented by US Patents 3,016,308, 3,516,846 and 3,516,941, as well as US 4,396,670<br>
to The Wiggins Teape Group Ltd., and many other more recent patent documents have<br>
addressed this subject.<br>
One can also find general literature reviews of such methods as well as of the uses<br>
of the microcapsules obtained there-from. For the sake of example there will be cited here<br>
the publications K. Dietrich et al. (1989 and 1990), Amino resin microcapsules, Acta<br><br>
Polymerica 40(4), pgs. 243-251, 40(5), pgs. 325-331, 40(11), pgs. 683-690 and 41(2),<br>
pgs. 91-95. Another general review of interest is that of H. Y. Lee et al., J.<br>
Microencapsulation (2002), 19 (5), pages 559-569.<br>
The person skilled in the art is also referred to recent documents such as<br>
International Patent Application WO 2006/018694, belonging to the present Applicant, as<br>
well as to US 6,024,943 to Quest International and WO 01/41915 to Microcapsules<br>
Technologies, and to the references generally cited in these documents.<br>
The preferred encapsulating shell material is a polymeric shell, which is the reaction<br>
product of urea or melamine and an aldehyde, such as formaldehyde. When aqueous<br>
slurries of such microcapsules are dried, the water evaporates and the encapsulated<br>
fragrance is fully retained in the dried microcapsules.<br>
The micro encapsulation principle is relatively simple. A thin polymer shell is<br>
created around droplets or particles of an active agent emulsified or dispersed in a carrier<br>
liquid. Preferred polymer materials for the microcapsules shell are those which are<br>
capable of polymerisation under acid pH from a water-soluble pre-polymer state. Such<br>
pre-polymers are made by reacting urea and formaldehyde in a formaldehyde urea molar<br>
ratio of from about 1.2:1 to 2.6:1. Thiourea, cyanuramide, guanidine, N-alkyl ureas,<br>
phenols, sulfonamides, anilines and amines can be included in small amounts as modifiers<br>
for the urea. These polymers formed from such pre-polymer materials, under acidic<br>
conditions, are water-insoluble and can provide the required capsule friability<br>
characteristics.<br>
As described in US 4,233,178, microcapsules based on melamine/formaldehyde<br>
resins are preferred over those based on urea/formaldehyde resins, because the resulting<br>
capsules are more impermeable due to a higher degree of cross-linking of the film-<br>
forming resin.<br>
Microcapsules made from the preferred melamine-formaldehyde shell materials can<br>
be made by the processes described in WO 01/51197, US 6,261,483, US 2003/0004226,<br>
US 4,406,816 and EP 0415273.<br>
In all the known processes, a large part of the obtained capsule slurry is water, and<br>
it often desired to eliminate this water and to obtain a dry capsule concentrate.<br>
Although in many cases the capsule slurry can be used, in certain applications, it is<br>
preferred to use such aminoplast capsules in a dry form because water disturbs the final<br>
structure or  composition  of the  final  product  into  which  the  microcapsules  are<br><br>
incorporated. Examples are water-free liquid detergents and fabric softeners for example,<br>
namely those packaged in water soluble polyvinyl alcohol pouches, hair oils, body oils,<br>
hair and body sprays based on cyclomethicone, powder detergents and fabric conditioning<br>
sheets typically intended for use in tumble dryers. In this latter case, during the<br>
preparation of the dryer sheets water-insoluble esterquats are applied as a hot melt on a<br>
non-woven material. These waxes are incompatible with water and have a melting point<br>
that is higher than the boiling point of water. Incorporation of aqueous slurries of<br>
aminoplast capsules is therefore not possible under such conditions.<br>
Another example of specific applications where melamine microcapsule solids are<br>
appropriate is the case of anhydrous liquid detergents which have the technical advantage<br>
that they can contain bleach and bleach activators but wherein the latter will react<br>
immediately in the presence of water, as described for example in US 4,800,035 or<br>
US 5,057,238, to Colgage Palmolive. It is therefore not convenient to add any aqueous<br>
emulsions or dispersions to such formulations.<br>
Non aqueous fabric softeners can be formulated on a completely oil-based<br>
composition which is then stable in water soluble polyvinyl alcohol packages such as<br>
described in US 6,492,315, to Colgate Palmolive. In such water-free bases, it is difficult<br>
to incorporate aqueous dispersions of microcapsules because they would readily separate<br>
from the formulation and attack the water soluble packaging, possibly causing leaking of<br>
the liquid softener during storage.<br>
In all such cases it is therefore required to incorporate the melarnine-formaldehyde<br>
microcapsules in solid form and the present invention brings exactly an advantageous<br>
solution to this problem by providing a process for converting the aqueous slurries into<br>
free flowing powders via spray drying of the slurry under well-controlled conditions.<br>
Although the concept of spray drying the slurries has been generally and briefly<br>
mentioned for example in US 20040071742 and in WO 2004/016234, no particular<br>
details or guidance to the specific process conditions used has been reported in the prior<br>
art. We have now surprisingly found that spray drying of the slurries must be carried out<br>
under specific processing parameters and using specific carrier materials in order to<br>
obtain a free flowing powder of the microcapsules enclosing the hydrophobic perfume or<br>
other material.<br>
In fact, we have been able to establish that, under many current spray drying<br>
method conditions, encompassed by a general reference or citation of possible spray<br><br>
drying methods to be applied to such aminoplast capsule slurries, there are not in fact<br>
obtained free flowing powders but products wherein the microcapsules tend to<br>
agglomerate and deliver unstable materials upon storage.<br>
This is a consequence of the fact that, as mentioned above, aminoplast<br>
microcapsules are generally prepared by interfacial polymerization in the presence of<br>
emulsifiers. These emulsifiers can be anionic thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, or combinations of such polymers, with anionic<br>
surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate. Such anionic thickeners are not incorporated<br>
into the capsule membrane and are still present in the final slurry.<br>
In other approaches, emulsifiers that have no thickening properties are used and<br>
they are incorporated into the capsule membrane during the polymerization process. Such<br>
emulsifiers are sulfonated copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid as described in<br>
WO 01/51197. To avoid separation of capsules from the final slurry, thickening polymers<br>
need to be post-added, requiring a further processing step to obtain viable powders.<br>
We have now found that, when aminoplast capsules are spray-dried, the thickening<br>
polymers strongly disturb the process. During the spray-drying process, the aminoplast<br>
capsules form sticky agglomerates and deposits on the inner walls of the spray-dryer<br>
because the melamine resin continues crosslinking under the high temperature conditions<br>
of the spray drying process. The presence of the thickening polymers in the aminoplast<br>
slurry thus promotes further agglomeration of the microcapsules amongst themselves and<br>
onto the reactor wall of the spray-dryer. Such deposits cannot be easily washed-off from<br>
the reactor walls and mechanical cleaning is required, increasing production time and<br>
cost. Moreover, the spray-dried powder is only obtained in small yields of maximum 30%<br>
and forms agglomerates and lumps that cannot be easily dispersed into liquid<br>
formulations. As a result, aminoplast microcapsules that are prepared according to the<br>
processes described in WO 98/28396 and US 5,188,753, for example, cannot in fact be<br>
efficiently spray-dried, because of the presence of the anionic emulsifying thickeners<br>
required for the encapsulation process.<br>
The present invention provides a process which avoids such problems. The process<br>
of the invention allows spray drying of aminoplast microcapsule slurries under specific<br>
conditions described hereafter.<br><br>
Moreover, the process of the invention dispenses with the need to add post-<br>
encapsulation thickening polymers to stabilize the aqueous slurry of capsules, thus<br>
avoiding their negative impact on the spray-drying process.<br>
We have now found that addition of de-tackifying colloids to aminoplast<br>
microcapsule slurries provides a temporary second coating around the microcapsules<br>
which inhibits further reaction of the aminoplast resin during the spray-drying.<br>
Water-insoluble inorganic powders such as zeolites, bentonites or silica, can be<br>
considered as such de-tackifying colloids, but a disadvantage of the use of such inorganic<br>
colloids is their strong thickening properties, rendering the microcapsule slurry difficult to<br>
spray-dry. In fact, usually such inorganic flowing agents are rather added to the dry<br>
powder after spray-drying in order to increase its flowability.<br>
Other possible de-tackifying colloids are anionic organic polymers, like gum<br>
Arabic, or non-ionic organic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol or alkyl modified<br>
cellulose derivatives, as previously cited. Typical examples are ethyl cellulose or<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose. Hydrocarbons and sugars, such as sucrose, mannose, maltose,<br>
sorbitol, xylitol or copolymers of sucrose and dextrose known as refined polydextrose<br>
(Litesse® from Danisco), or yet dehydrated glucose obtained from hydrolysis of starch<br>
(Glucidex® 6 from Roquette), have also been used as de-tackifying agents.<br>
However, due to their lack of emulsification properties, many of such products still<br>
allow some agglomeration of the microcapsules during spray drying and need to be added<br>
at fairly high quantities in order to reduce the sticky deposits of the capsules on the<br>
reactor walls of the spray-dryer to allow easy wash-off thereof with water.<br>
It is thus that, although in WO 2004/016234 to Quest, spray-drying of aminoplast<br>
microcapsules in the presence of carboxymethylcellulose is described in example 7, no<br>
specific benefit of the use of this water-soluble coating could in fact be found with regard<br>
to this microcapsule agglomeration and wall depositing problem. Although the resulting<br>
powder is described in this document as being free-flowing, in our own experience such<br>
spray-dried powders were sticky and difficult to wash off from the spray-drier.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of powders from<br>
aqueous aminoplast microcapsule slurries, via spray drying the latter using specific<br>
materials as spray drying carriers. The process of the invention allows full retention of the<br>
encapsulated hydrophobic material, namely fragrance, during the spray drying and makes<br>
it possible to improve the odor quality of the aminoplast microcapsules thus obtained.<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of powders of<br>
aminoplast, and more particularly melamine-formaldehyde, microcapules containing<br>
fragrances or other hydrophobic materials, wherein an aqueous slurry of aminoplast<br>
microcapsules, comprising a water soluble organic de-tackifying colloid having<br>
emulsifying properties, is spray-dried in a generally known manner. Prior to the spray-<br>
drying the pH of the slurry is adjusted to a value comprised between 4 and 6 by means of<br>
an acid.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the aminoplast capsule<br>
slurry further contains a flame retardant agent. Suitable such agents are described in detail<br>
in International patent applications WO 03/043728 and PCT/IB2005/053089, belonging<br>
to the present Applicant and the contents of which are hereby included by reference. The<br>
use of short chain carboxylic acids, as described therein, is preferred.<br>
The concentration of capsules in the aqueous slurries which are dried according to<br>
the process of the invention will be typically comprised between 0.5 and 50% by weight,<br>
relative to the total weight of aqueous suspension.<br>
The dry capsules resulting from the process of the invention form a non-sticky<br>
powder that is easy to wash-off with hot water from the reactor walls of the spray-drying<br>
tower, does not have any amine smell (unlike what is the case with the dried aminoplast<br>
microcapsule products prior known) and is free flowing. Moreover, it easily disperses in<br>
aqueous and non-aqueous formulations of a variety of liquid consumer products without<br>
the help of any dispersing agents. In water, the powder disperses into the original particle<br>
size of the microcapsules without the formation of agglomerates, the particle size being<br>
fully retained during the spray-drying process.<br>
We have now established that water soluble colloids with emulsifying properties<br>
showed excellent de-tackifying performance during the spray-drying process of<br>
aminoplast capsules. Addition of such emulsifying colloids strongly increased the final<br>
yield of spray-dried powder and allowed easy cleaning of the spray-drier with water. In<br>
particular, addition of lipophilised cellulose such as dioctenylsuccinated starch (Capsul®<br>
from National Starch), HI-CAP® 100 (hydrogen octenylbutanedioate starch), or of<br>
emulsion  stabilizing  starch  derivatives  obtained   from  waxy  maize   (such  as  the<br><br>
commercial products of the type of Purity Gum 2000 from National Starch) to the<br>
aminoplast capsule slurry avoided agglomeration and lump formation of the spray-dried<br>
microcapsules and allowed easy dispersion of the dried capsules in the end-product liquid<br>
formulations into which they were incorporated.<br>
Moreover, the above-mentioned preferred embodiment of the process of the<br>
invention is particularly useful for preparing powdered melamine-formaldehyde based<br>
microcapsules. This type of microcapsules typically exhale a strong amine smell. We<br>
have now been able to completely eliminate this malodor by reducing the pH of the slurry<br>
to pH = 5 with an acid such as citric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfonic acid for example.<br>
Surprisingly, we have also established that the acid further improves the emulsification<br>
properties of the colloid, namely Capsul®, thus improving the dispersibility of the<br>
microcapsule powder thus obtained in liquid formulations.<br>
The emulsifying properties of such modified starch derivatives could be clearly<br>
seen in the resulting particle size distribution of the spray-dried capsules. When Capsul®<br>
or Purity Gum 2000 were added to the capsule slurry, the spray-dried powder obtained<br>
showed a more homogeneous and smaller average particle size, compared to capsules<br>
spray-dried in the presence of Litesse® Ultra or Glucidex® 6, which were also tested but<br>
did not provide as good results, or required substantially higher amounts to be used to<br>
achieve similar results.<br>
According to the invention, a modified starch of anionic character with emulsifying<br>
properties is preferred as the detackifying colloid. The modified starch is added to the<br>
slurry in an amount comprised between 1 and 10%, and more preferably between 1 and<br>
3% by weight, relative to the weight of the slurry.<br>
The modified starches appropriate for use according to the invention include<br>
hydrolyzed starch, acid thinned starch, starch esters of long chain hydrocarbons, starch<br>
acetates, starch octenyl succinate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The term "hydrolyzed starch" is meant to mean here oligosaccharide-type materials<br>
that are typically obtained by acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starches, preferably<br>
corn starch. Suitable hydrolyzed starches include maltodextrins and corn syrup solids.<br>
Starch esters having a degree of substitution in the range of from about 0.01% to about<br>
10.0% are also useful. The hydrocarbon part of the modifying ester should be from a C5<br>
to C16 carbon chain.<br><br>
Preferably, octenylsuccinate substituted waxy corn starches of various types shall<br>
be used, such as:<br>
1)	waxy starch: acid thinned and octenylsuccinate substituted;<br>
2)	blend of corn syrup solids: waxy starch, octenylsuccinate substituted, and<br>
dextrinized;<br>
3)	waxy starch: octenylsuccinate substituted and dextrinized;<br>
4)	blend of corn syrup solids or maltodextrins with waxy starch: acid thinned<br>
octenylsuccinate substituted, and then cooked and spray dried; and<br>
5)	waxy starch: acid thinned and octenylsuccinate substituted, then cooked and<br>
spray dried<br>
can also be used in the present invention. Commercialized starches that are<br>
advantageously used in the context of the invention include the products sold under the<br>
tradenames Capsul®, HiCap® and Alcocap®, as well as Purity Gum 2000, all from<br>
National Starch.<br>
According to very advantageous embodiments of the process of the invention, there<br>
is further added to the microcapsule slurry a flame retardant agent which is intended to<br>
allow for reduction of the powder explosivity during the spray drying process and/or<br>
during storage thereof.<br>
The flame retardant agents that are appropriate for use according to the invention<br>
include all the materials that have been cited in this capacity in the previously cited<br>
International patent applications, the contents of which are hereby included by reference.<br>
Examples of such ingredients are described in detail in these documents which further<br>
disclose the appropriate amounts thereof to be used in spray drying processes.<br>
As the encapsulate in the microcapsules of the invention, there can be used a wide<br>
range of water- insoluble materials, amongst which there can be cited flavors and<br>
fragrances, antimicrobial or bacteriostatic agents, or yet malodor counteracting agents,<br>
and cosmetic/cosmaceutical or nutritional/nutraceutical ingredients. Following preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, will be used fragrance compositions or ingredients,<br>
antibacterial or malodor counteracting agents.<br>
Preferred embodiments resort to the use of fragrance ingredients or compositions.<br>
By fragrance ingredients or composition it is understood here an ingredient or mixture of<br>
ingredients capable of activation an olfactive receptor of a human or animal subject.<br>
These are typically mixtures of ingredients capable of imparting a pleasant odor to the<br><br>
end product into which the microcapsules are incorporated, and the skilled perfumer is<br>
able to create such mixtures as a function of the perfuming effect that it is desired to<br>
impart and the perfumer's own creative capabilities.<br>
The nature of the fragrance contained in the capsules is therefore immaterial in the<br>
context of the invention, provided that it is compatible with the materials forming the<br>
capsules. It will be typically chosen as a function of the perfuming effect that is desired to<br>
achieve with the dispersion or consumer product of the invention, and it will be<br>
formulated according to current practices in the art of perfumery. It may consist of a<br>
perfume ingredient or a composition. These terms can define a variety of odorant<br>
materials of both natural and synthetic origin, currently used for the preparation of<br>
perfumed consumer products. They include single compounds or mixtures. Specific<br>
examples of such components may be found in the current literature, e.g. Perfume and<br>
Flavor Chemicals by S. Arctander 1969, Montclair, N.J. (USA). These substances are<br>
well known to the person skilled in the art of perfuming consumer products, i.e. of<br>
imparting an odor to a consumer product traditionally fragranced, or of modifying the<br>
odor of said consumer product.<br>
Natural extracts can also be encapsulated into the system of the invention; these<br>
include e.g. citrus extracts such as lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit or mandarin oils, or<br>
essentials oils of plants, herbs and fruits, amongst other.<br>
The prior art is rich in citations of such fragrance compositions and even in reports<br>
of allegedly optimised perfumes to be encapsulated, so as to provide stable<br>
microcapsules. General rules of perfume creation have been used for a while as evidenced<br>
by the contents of earlier patent literature of which the patent publications WO 01/41915<br>
to Microcapsule Technologies, and WO 98/28398 and WO 02/74430 to Quest<br>
International are representative examples freely available to the perfumer. All these prior<br>
art reports are part of the general knowledge in the art and can be used by the skilled<br>
perfumer without particular difficulty and are thus naturally incorporated into the present<br>
disclosure by way of reference and citation. A more detailed description of the fragrance<br>
compositions that can be used according to the invention is thus not warranted here.<br>
The amount of oil encapsulated in the powders obtained according to the invention<br>
varies in a wide range values, typically comprised between 1 and 90% by weight, more<br>
preferably between 20 and 80% by weight, relative to the weight of powder.<br><br>
In addition to the fragranced capsules, the perfuming microcapsules obtained<br>
according to the invention may comprise optional ingredients such as antibacterial agents,<br>
cosmetic emollients, vitamins, cooling agents, softeners, lubricants, gloss enhancing<br>
agents or any other current active ingredient used in cosmetic or household applications,<br>
as long as the latter do not alter the capsules.<br>
The invention also relates to the consumer products obtained by incorporation of the<br>
microcapsule powders obtained as described above in the final product. Examples are<br>
water-free liquid detergents and fabric softeners, namely those packaged in water soluble<br>
polyvinyl alcohol pouches, hair oils, body oils, hair and body sprays based on<br>
cyclomethicone, powder detergents and fabric conditioning sheets typically intended for<br>
use in tumble dryers.<br>
The concentration in which the powder microcapsules of the invention can be added<br>
to these products are typically comprised between 0.1 and 10.0% by weight relative to the<br>
weight of the product. Such concentrations are given strictly by way of example since<br>
their value depends on the perfuming effect desired and on the nature of the product and<br>
can be easily adjusted accordingly.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of melamine-formaldehyde microcapsule aqueous slurries<br>
a) Fragranced melamine-formaldehyde capsules were prepared by the process<br>
described in US 5,162,486. The resulting microcapsule slurry contained 40% by<br>
weight of microcapsules, with 32% by weight of encapsulated fragrance. The<br>
encapsulated model fragrance POLYNESIA CP 147869 H (woody, floral; origin:<br>
Firmenich SA) had a flash point of 97°C.<br>
- Such fragranced microcapsules are commercially available under the trade name<br>
PopScent® from Firmenich SA.<br>
The capsule's content of the slurry was determined by analyzing the dry solids<br>
thereof using a microwave balance from Sartorius (Model MMA 30).<br>
The encapsulated fragrance content was determined by hydro-distillation.<br><br>
Particle size of the microcapsules in the slurry was around 2 to 3 microns, as<br>
determined via a Malvern particle size analyser.<br>
No thickening polymer was added to the slurry. To avoid separation of the<br>
microcapsules from the slurry, the dispersion was continuously agitated during the<br>
spray-drying process.<br>
b)	To the aqueous microcapsule dispersion obtained in a), there was added 0.2%, by<br>
weight, relative to the slurry weight, of Tylose® 60'0000, available from Clariant.<br>
Tylose®    60'000    is    a    water    soluble,    non-ionic    thickening    polymer<br>
(Methylhydroxyethyl Cellulose). The thickener stabilized the aqueous capsule<br>
dispersion and no continuous agitation was required in order to keep a homogeneous<br>
aqueous dispersion of the capsules.<br>
c)	To the aqueous microcapsule dispersion obtained in a), there was added 0.2%, by<br>
weight, relative to the slurry weight, of Blanose® from Aqualon.<br>
Blanose® is a water soluble, anionic thickening polymer (refined Carboxymethyl<br>
Cellulose). The thickener stabilized the aqueous capsule dispersion and no<br>
continuous agitation was required in order to keep a homogeneous aqueous<br>
dispersion of the capsules.<br>
d)	Fragranced melamine-formaldehyde capsules were prepared as described in a)<br>
using, as the encapsulated raw material, Limonene, which has a flash point of 47°C.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of melamine-formaldehyde microcapsule powders<br>
To 100 parts by weight of the slurry of aminoplast microcapsules from Example la) there<br>
were added 52 parts by weight of a 20% aqueous solution of different modified starches<br>
as summarized in Table I below. The blends were neutralized with citric acid (50%<br>
aqueous solution) until pH = 5.<br>
The microcapsule aqueous dispersions thus obtained were then spray-dried at Büchi<br>
Spray Dryer Model B 290.<br><br>
The temperature of the incoming air in the spray dryer was 185°C-190°C, the<br>
temperature of the outcoming air 95°C - 105°C. A biphase spray nozzle was used with a<br>
nozzle diameter of 0.7 mm.<br><br>
The addition of Capsul® and Purity Gum to the aqueous slurries resulted in spray-dried<br>
powders with a more homogeneous particle size distribution and a much smaller average<br>
particle size that those of the powders obtained by adding Litesse® Ultra or Glucidex® to<br>
the aqueous dispersions of microcapsules.<br>
Analytical measurements:<br>
The amount of encapsulated fragrance in the dry powder was determined by<br>
hydrodistillation.<br><br>
Particle size of dry powder was determined by laser diffraction from a sample of the un-<br>
sieved product. Particle size of the capsule slurry and the powder dispersed in water was<br>
determined by laser diffraction with Malvern particle size analyser. The results of the<br>
volume weighted average are presented as D[4,3] in microns.<br>
Explosivity was determined by a 20 liter Sphere Apparatus. The 20 liter sphere monitors<br>
the evolution of the explosion pressure of fuel/air mixtures in a closed vessel (under<br>
vacuum, chemical ignition source of 10 kJ) with time, over a range of product<br>
concentrations. This enables determination of the maximum explosion pressure, Pmax,<br>
the dust explosion violence, Kst, and the dust explosion hazard class, the ST-class,<br>
according to VDI-3673.<br>
The amount of external fragrance on the spray-dried microcapsules was determined by<br>
mild extraction of the powder with isooctane for 10 minutes. The centrifuged solvent was<br>
injected into a GC-MS spectrometer and the amount of fragrance quantified by<br>
comparison to a reference of a 1% by weight solution of the fragrance in isooctane.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of melamine-formaldehyde microcapsule powders<br>
Similar tests to those described in Example 5 were carried out with the ingredients<br>
summarized in Table II, in the amounts indicated, using the microcapsule slurries<br>
prepared in Example 1.<br>
The dispersions obtained were then spray-dried at Biichi Spray Dryer Model B 290.<br>
The temperature of the  incoming air in the spray dryer was   185°C-190°C, the<br>
temperature of the outcoming air 95°C - 105°C. A biphase spray nozzle was used with a<br>
nozzle diameter of 0.7 mm.<br>
The results of these tests are summarized in Table II.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of a Baby Oil Gel containing spray-dried fragranced aminoplast capsules<br>
A baby oil gel was prepared by admixture, in a generally known manner, of the<br>
ingredients cited in Table III below, in the proportions indicated.<br><br>
The part A ingredients were mixed at 70°C until reaching a uniform mixture. Part B was<br>
heated to 60°C until clear. Premixed part B was then added to part A and they were mixed<br>
together until obtaining a homogeneous mixture that was then cooled down to 45°C<br>
before adding part C to it.<br>
The microcapsules remained homogeneously dispersed in the above formula during a 3<br>
months storage at ambient temperature (around 25°C).<br><br>
Preparation of a Non-Aqueous (water-free) Liquid Fabric Softener containing spray-dried<br>
fragranced aminoplast capsules<br>
An anhydrous liquid fabric softener was prepared by admixture, in a generally known<br>
manner, in the order and proportions indicated in Table IV below, of the cited ingredients,<br>
using the powder microcapsules of Sample L described in Table II of Example 3.<br><br>
The above liquid softener formulation was packaged into a polyvinyl alcohol sachet<br>
having film thickness of about 0.3 mm. The sachets containing the above formula<br>
remained stable during 3 months storage at room temperature and they dissolved rapidly<br>
within one to two minutes of starting a wash cycle.<br><br>
