				<td>COMPODKDS SPECIFIC TO ADENOSINE A1, A2A, AND A2, RECEPTOR AND<br>
USES THEREOF<br>
This applicacion is a continuation-in-part and claims priority of U.S. Serial Nos. 09/454,074,filed December 2, 1999, 09/454,254, filed December 2, 1999, and 09/454,075, December 2, 1999, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Throughout this applicaticn, reference is made to compounds chat specifically bina to i) adenosine Alf receptors, (such as inter alia, pages 4-76, 130-175, and 257-287,) ii) adenosine<br>
A2, receptors (such as inter alia, pages 176-201, and pages 288-293), and adenosine A3 receptors (such as inter alia, pages 202-256, and 294-300).<br>
Background of Che Inventlon<br>
Adenosine is an ubiquitous modulator of numerous physiological activities, particularly within the cardiovascular and nervous systems. The effects of adenosine appear to be mediated by specific cell surface receptor proteins. Adenosine modulates diverse physiological functions including induction of sedation, vasodilation, auppreasion of cardiac rate and contractility, inhibition of platelet aggregability, stimulation of gluconeogenesis and inhibition of lipolys.is. In addition to its effects on adenylate cyclase, adenosine has been shown to open potassium channels, reduce flux through calcium channels, and inhibit or stimulate phosphoinositide turnover through receptor-mediated mechanisms (See for example, C.E. Muller and B. Stein "Adenosine Receptor Antagonists: Structures and Potenţial Therapeutic Applications," Current Pharmaceutical<br>
Design, 2:501 (1996) and C.E. Muller "Aj-Adenosine Receptor Antagonists," Exp. Opin. Thsr. Patents 7(5):419 (1997)).Adenosine receptors belong to the superfamily of purine receptors which are currently subdivided into P: (adenosine) and ?2 (ATP, ADP, and other nucleotides) receptors. Four receptor subtypes for the nucleoside adenosine have been cloned so far f rom various species including humans. Two receptor subtypes (Ai and A2a) exhibit affinity for adenosine in the nanomolar range while two other known subtypes A2b and A3 are low-affinity receptors, with affinity for adenosine in the low-micromolar range. A! and A3 adenosine receptor activation can lead to an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, while A2a and A2b activation causes a stimulation of adenylate cyclase.<br>
A few AX antagonists have been developed for the treatment of cognitive disease, renal failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. It has been suggested that A2a antagonists may be beneficial for patients suffering f rom Morbus Parkinson (Parkinson's disease) . Particularly in view of the potenţial for local delivery, adenosine receptor antagonists may be valuable for treatment of allergic inflammation and asthma. Available information (for example, Nyce &amp; Metzger "DNA antisense Therapy for Asthma in an Animal Model" Nature (1997) 385: 721-5) indicates that in this pathophysiologic context, A, antagonists may block contraction of smooth muscle underlying respiratory epithelia, while A2&amp; or A3 receptor antagonists may block mast cell degranulation, mitigating the release of histamine and other inf lammatory mediators. A:s receptors have been discovered throughout the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the colon and the intestinal epithelia. It has been suggested that A,b receptors mediate cAMP response (Strohmeier et al., J. Bio. Chem. (1995) 270:2387-94).<br>
Adenosine receptors have also been shown to exist on the retinas of various mammalian species including bovine, porcine, monkey, rât, guinea pig, mouse, rabbit and human (See, Blazynski et al., Discrete Distributions of Adenosine<br>
Receptors in Maimalian Retina, Journal of Neurochsmistry, volume 54, pages 648-655 (1990); Woods et al., Characterization of Adenosine A2-Receptor Binding Sites in Bovine Retinal Afembranes, Experimental Eye Research, volume 53, pages 325-331 (1991); and Braas et al., Endogenous adenosine and adenosine receptors localized to ganglion cella of the retina, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, volume 84, pages 3906-3910 (1987)). Recently,<br>
Williams reported the observation of adenosine transport sites in a cultured human retinal cell line (Williams et al.,<br>
Nucleoside Transport Sites in a Cultured Human Retinal Cell Line Established By SV-40 T Antigen Gene, Current Eye Research, volume 13, pages 109-118 (1994)).<br>
Compounds which regulate the uptake of adenosine uptake have previously been suggested as potenţial therapeutic agents for the treatment of retinal and optic nerve head damage. In U.S. Patent No. 5,780,450 to Shade, Shade discusses the use of adenosine uptake inhibitors for treating eye disorders. Shade does not disclose the use of specific A3 receptor inhibitors. The entire contents of U.S. Patent No. 5,780,450 are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Additional adenosine receptor antagbnists are needed as pharmacological tools and are of considerable interest as drugs for the above-referenced disease states and/or condiţiona.<br>

When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and mammals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination wich a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceuticallyl acceptable carrier" as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liguid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting a compound(s) of the<br>
cresent invention withir. or to the suc^ecr sucf. tnat ir c s r. oerforrns its intended function.  Typically, such compound? are carried or transportec f rom one crgar.. or port ier. of the faody, to another organ, or portion of che body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulat ion and noc ir.jurious t o che patient. Some examples of materials which car. serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate;  powdered  tragacanth;  malt;   gelatin,-  talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oii, cottonseed oii, safflower oii, sesame oii, olive oii, corn oii and soybean oii; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols,  such as glycerin,  sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible   substances   employed   in   pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
As set out above, certain embodiments of the present compounds can contain a basic funcţional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in si tu<br>
during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base foim with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate,<br>
acerate, valerate, eleate, paimitate, stearaze, _aurat=. benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, -aieats, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthyiate, mesylâ-a, glucoheptonare, lactobionate, and laurylsulphonate salts ar.d che like. (See, e.g., Berge ec al. (1977) "Pharnaceutical<br>
Salts",   J.  Pharat.  Sci.   66:1-19).<br>
In other cases, the compounds of che present invention may concain one or more acidic funcţional groups and, thus, are capable of forming phannaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term "phannaceutically acceptable salts" in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ during the final<br>
isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable  base,  such  as  the  hydroxide,  carbonate  or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine.  Representative alkali or alkaline  earth  salts  include  the  lithium,  sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like.  Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable esters" refers to the relatively non-toxic, esterified products of the compounds of the present invention. These esters can be prepared in si tu<br>
during the final isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form or hydroxyl with a suitable esterifying agent. Carboxylic acids can be converted into esters via treattnent<br>
with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. Hydroxyl containing derivatives can be converted into esters via<br>
crearmenr with ar. estenfy.ng agent such as alkanoyl halides. The term is further intended te include lower hycrocarrcr. groups capable of being solvated under physiologiral conditions, e.g., alkyl esters, methyl, ethyl and propyl<br>
esters.  (See, for example, Berge et al., supra.)<br>
The invention further contemplates the use of prodrugs which are converted in vivo to the therapeutic compcunds of the<br>
invention (see, e.g., R.B. Silverman, 1992, "The Organic<br>
Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action", Academic Press, Chapter 8}. Such prodrugs can be used to alter the biodistribution [e.g., to allow compounds which would not<br>
typically enter the reactive site of the protease) or the pharmacokinetics of the therapeutic compound. For example, a carboxylic acid group, can be esterified, e.g., with a<br>
methyl group or an ethyl group to yield an ester. When the ester is administered to a subject, the ester is cleaved, enzymatically or non-enzymatically, reductively or hydrolytically, to reveal the anionic group. An anionic group can be esterified with moieties (e.g., acyloxytnethyl<br>
esters) which are cleaved to reveal an intermediate compound which subsequently decomposes to yield the active compound. In another embodiment, the prodrug is a reduced form of a sulfate or sulfonate, e.g., a thiol, which is oxidized in<br>
vivo to the therapeutic compound.  Furthermore, an anionic<br>
moiety can be esterified to a group which is actively transported in vivo, or which is selectively taken up by<br>
target organs.  The ester can be selected to allow specific<br>
targeting of the therapeutic moieties to particular reactive sites, as described below for carrier moieties.<br>
Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.<br>
Sxamples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: water soiuble anrioxidants, such as asccrbic acid, cysteir.e hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium mecabisuifiţe, scdiur. sulfiţe and the like; oil-solubie ancioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (SKAÎ , butylated hydroxycoluene (BKT), lecithin, propyl gallate, aipha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid !EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.<br>
Formulations of the presant invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical, transdermal, buccal, sublingual, rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administrat ion. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage ferm will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range f rom about l per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 per cent to about 70 per cent, most preferably from about 10 per cent to about 30 per cent.<br>
Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound o£ the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>

Ophthalmic fortnulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is an ophthalmic formulation (e.g., an periocular, retrobulbar or intraocular injection formulation, a systemic formulation, or a surgical irrigating solution).<br>
The ophthalmic formulations of the present invention may include one or more deazapurines and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Various types of vehicles may be used. The vehicles will generally be aqueous in nature. Aqueous solutions are generally preferred, based on case of<br>
formulation,  as well as a pacient's abiiity te easily administer such compositions by means of instillir.g one tr two drops of the solutions in the affected eyes.  However, the deazapurines of the present invention may aiso be readily ! incorporated into other types of compositions,  such as suspensions, viscous or semi-viscous gels or other types of solid  or  semi-solid  compositions.     The  ophthalnic compositions of the present invention may also include various other ingredients, such as buffers, preservatives, co-solvents and viscosity building agents.<br>
An appropriate buffer system (e.g., sodium phosphate, sodium acetate or sodium borate) may be added to prevent pH drift<br>
under storage conditions.<br>
Ophthalmic products are typically packaged in multidose form. Preservatives are thus required to prevent microbial contamination during use. Suitable preservatives include: benzalkoniutn chloride, thimerosal, chlorobutanol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, phenylethyl alcohol, edetate disodium, sorbic acid, polyquaternium-l, or other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such preservatives are typically employed at a level of f rom 0.001 to l. OV weight/volume ("% w/v") .<br>
When the deazapurines of the present invention are administered during intraocular surgical procedures, such as through retrobulbar or periocular injection and intraocular perfusion or injection, the use of balanced salt irrigating solutions as vehicles are most preferred. BSS® Sterile Irrigating Solution and BSS Plus® Sterile Intraocular Irrigating Solution (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, Texas, USA) are examples of physiologically balanced intraocular irrigating solutions. The lâtter type of solution îs described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,550,022 (Garabedian, et ai.), the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated<br>
in the present specification by reference.  Retrobulbar and periocular injections are known to those skilled in the art<br>
and are described ir. numerous publications inciuding, fcr exaraple, Ophchalmic Surgery: Principies of Practice, Ed., G. L. Spaech. W. B. Sanders Co., Philadelphia, Pa., U.S. A., pages 85-87 (1990).<br>
As indicated above, use of deazapurines co prever.r cr reduce damage ta retinal and optic nerve head tissues ar the cellular level is a particularly important aspect of one embodiment of the invention. Ophthalmic conditions which may be treated include, but are not limited to, retinopathies, macular degeneration, ocular ischemia, glaucoma, and damage associated with injuries to ophthalmic tissues, such as ischemia reperfusion injuries, photochemical injuries, and injuries associated with ocular surgery, particularly injuries to the retina or optic nerve head by exposure to light or surgical instruments. The compounds may also be used as an adjunct to ophthalmic surgery, such as by vitreal or subconjuneţival injection following ophthalmic surgery. The compounds may be used for acute treatment of temporary conditions, or may be administered chronically, especially in the case of degenerative disease. The compounds may also be used prophylactically, especially prior to ocular surgery or noninvasive ophthalmic procedures, or other types of surgery.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invencion suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulat ion isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. •<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol.<br>
propylene glyccl, polyethylene glycoi, and the lika! , ar.d suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oii. and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Prcper fluidicy can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required partide size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservativcs, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may bc ensured by the inciusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inciusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oii vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polytner employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable<br>
Eormulations are also prepared by enrrapcing the drug ir. Liposoraes or microemulsior.s which are corapatibie with body lissue.<br>
The preparations of the present invencion may be giver. orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given by forms suitable for each administraiion route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Oral administration is preferred.<br>

The key reaction toward 6-methylpyrrolopyrimidines (1) 013] was cyclization of a cyanoacetate with benzamidine to a pyrimidine. It was believed methyl cyanoacetate would cyclize more efficiently with benzamidine to a pyrimidine than the corresponding ethyl ester. Therefore, transesterification and alkylation of ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of NaOMe and an excess of an a-haloacetyl moiety, e. g., chloroacetone, gave the desired methyl ester<br>
(3) in 79% yield (Scheme IV) . The ketoester (3) was protected as the acetal (4) in 81% yield. A new cyclization method to the pyrimidine (5) was achieved with an amidine hydrochloride, e. g., benzamidine hydrochloride, with 2<br>
equivalents of DBU to afford the 5 in 54% isoiaied yieid. This method improves the yield from 20% using the publishec conditions, which utilizes NaOMe during the cyciization with guanidine. Cyclization to the pyrrole-pyrimidine (6) was achieved via deprotection of the acetal in aqueous HCl in 78% yield. Reaction of (6) with phosphorous oxychloride ac reflux gave the corresponding 4-chloro derivative (7) . Coupling with trans-4-aminocyclohexanol in dimethyl sulfoxide at 135°C gave (1) in 57% from (7) .

mono- (11), and diacylated (12) pyrroles, which were separated by flash chromatography. Acid hydrolysis of the disubstituted pyrrole (12) generated a combined yield of 29% for the acylpyrrole (11) . Cyclization in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid and DMF yielded (13) (23%), which was deprotected with polyphosphoric acid to (14).

Aliquots f rom overnight cultures were chen diluced in LT media, containing 4U/ml adenosine ieaminase (Type VI or VII from calf intestinal mucosa, Sigma), to obtain ODţot - 0.15 (1.5 X 10£ cells/ml} for CY8362 (A2aR) and ODfoo - 0.50 (5X10* cells/ml) for CY12660 (AjR) .<br>
kssays were conducted with a final volume of 100 ui in 96-<br>
well microtiter plates, such that a final concern: r a cier. of 2%<br>
DMSO was achieved in all wells.  For primary screer.inc. 1-2<br>
concentrations of test compounds were utilized (10 uM. lyM î .<br>
For compound profiling, 8 concentrations were tested (10000,<br>
1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, l and 0.1 nM) . To each microtiter<br>
place, 10 ui of 20* DMSO was added to "Control" and "Total"<br>
wells while 10 ui of Test Compound (in 20% DMSO) was added to<br>
"Unknown" wells.  Subseguently, 10 ui of NECA (5 uM for A;R,<br>
l uM for A2aR) were added to "Total" and "Unknown" wells; 10 ui<br>
of PBS was added to the "Control" wells.   In the final<br>
addition, 80 ui of yeast străin, CY8362 or CY126SO, were<br>
added to all wells.  All plates were then agitated briefly<br>
(LabLine orbital shaker 2-3 min) and allowed to incubate for<br>
4 hrs. at 30CC in a dry oven.<br>
3-Galactosidase activity can be quantitated using either colorimetric (e.g., ONPG, CPRG), luminescent (e.g., Galacton-Star) or fluorometric substrates (e.g., FDG, Resorufin) substrates. Currently, fluorescence detection is preferred l on the basis of superior signal moise ratio, relative freedom f rom interference and low cost. Fluorescein digalactopyranoside (FDG, Molecular Probes or Marker Gene Technologies) , a fluorescent (î-Galactosidase substrate, was added to all wells at 20 ul/well (final concentration » 80 uM) . Plates were shaken for 5-6 sec (LabLine orbital shaker) and then incubated at 37°C for 90 min (95% O:/5% C0: incubator). At the end of the 90 min incubation period, 3-Galactosidase activity was stopped using 20 ul/well of IM Na;C03 and all plates shaken for 5-6 sec. Plates were then agitated for 6 sec and relative fluorescence intensity determined using a fluorometer (Tecan Spectrafluor; excitation  485 nm, emission  535 nm).<br>
Calculations: Relative fluorescence values for "Control" wells were interpreted as background and subtracted from "Total" and "Unknown" values.   Compound profiles were analyzed via lagarithmic transformation (x-axis: compound concentration) followed by one site competition curve fitting to calculate<br>

Construcţiei! of Yeast Strains Expres s ing Hunan Aa Adenosine Receptor<br>
In this example, the construction of yeast strains expressing a human Ai adenosine receptor functionally integrated into the yeast pheromone system pathway is described.<br>
X.  Expression Vector Conotruction<br>
To constrxict a yeast expression vector for the human Aj adenosine receptor, the A: adenosine receptor cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR of human hippocampus mRNA using primers designed based on the published seguence of the human Al adenosine receptor and standard techniques. The PCR product was subcloned into the Ncol and Xbal sites of the yeast expression plasmid pMPIS .<br>
The pMPIS plasmid was created f rom pLPXt as follows: The Kbal site of YEP51 (Broach, J.R. et al. (1983) "Vectors for ligh-level, inducible expression of cloned genes in yeast" p. 33-117 in M. Inouye (ed.), Experimental Manipulation of Gene îxpression. Academic Press, New York) was eliminated by<br>
digestion, enc-fill and reiigation co -create YepSINccrxba. Another Xbal site was created at the BamHI site by digeste h BamHI, end-fill, linJcer (New England Biolabs, * 1081) ligation,  Xbal  digestion and  re-ligation  to  generate YEPSINcoXt.  This plasmid was digested with Esp3l and Nccl and ligated to Leu2 and PGKp fragments generated by PCR.  The 2 kb Leu2 PCR product was generated by atnplification froir. YEPSINco using primers containing Esp31 and BglII sites. The 660 base pair PGKp PCR product was generated by amplification from pPGKas (Kang, Y.-S. et al.  (1990) Mol. Ceil. Biol. JLQ.-2582-2590) with PCR primers containing BglII and Ncol sites.  The resulting plasmid is called pLPXt.  pLPXt was tnodified by inserting the coding region of the a-factor pre-pro leader into the Ncol site.   The prepro leader was inserted so that the Ncol cloning site was maintained at the 3' end of the leader, but not regenerated at the 5' end.  In this way receptors can be cloned by digestion of the plasmid with Ncol and Xbal. The resulting plasmid is called pMPIS.<br>
The pMPIS plasmid into which was inserted the human At adenosine receptor cDNA was designated p5095. In this vector, the receptor cDNA is fused to the 3' end of the yeast a-factor prepro leader. During protein maturation the prepro peptide sequences are cleaved to generate mature full-length receptor. This occurs during processing of the receptor through the yeast secretory pathway. This plasmid is maintained by Leu selection (i.e., growth on medium lacking leucine). The sequence of the cloned coding region was determined and found to be equivalent to that in the published literature (GenBank accession numbers S45235 and S56143).<br>
II.  Y«a*t Străin Construction<br>
To create a yeast străin expressing the human A: adenosine receptor, yeast străin CY7967 was used as the starting parental străin. The genotype of CY7967 is as follows:<br>

Two plasmicis were transformed inco străin CV~5S~ by electroporation: plasmid p5095 (encoding human A: adenosine receptor; described above) and plasmid p!584, which is a FUSl-3-galactosidase reporter gene plasmid. Plasmid pl5S4 was derived from plasmid pRS426 (Christianson, T.w. et al. (1992) Gene lip;119-1122) . Plasmid pRS426 contains a polylinker site ac nucleotides 2004-2016. A fusion between the FUS1 promoter and the &amp;-galactosidase gene was inserted at the restriction sites EagI and Xhol to create plasmid pl584. The p!584 plasmid is maintained by Trp selection (i.e., growth on medium lacking leucine).<br>
The resultant străin carrying p5095 and pl584, referred to as CY12660, expresses the human Ax adenosine receptor. To grow this străin in liquid or on agar plates, minimal media lacking leucine and tryptophan was used. To perform a growth assay on plates (assaying FUS1-HIS3), the plates were at pH 6.8 and contained 0.5-2.5 mM 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole and lacked leucine, tryptophan and histidine. As a control for specificity, a comparison with ane or more other yeast-based seven transmembrane receptor screens was included in all experiments.<br>
Coastruction of Yeast Strains Expressing Huaan A2a Adenosine Receptor<br>
In this example, the construction of yeast strains expressing a hutnan A2a adenosine receptor functionally integrated into the yeast pheromone system pathway is described.<br>
Z.  Expression Vector Conatniction<br>
To construct a yeast expression vector for the human A2a adenosine receptor, the human A2a receptor cDNA was obtained f rom Dr. Phil Murphy (NIH) . Upon receipt of this clone, the A2a receptor insert was sequenced and found to be identical to the published sequence (GenBank accession # S46950) . The receptor cDNA was excised frotn the plasmid by PCR with VENT polymerase and cloned into the plasmid pLPBX, which drives receptor expression by a constitutive Phosphoglycerate Kinase (PGK) protnoter in yeast. The sequence of the .entire insert was once again sequenced and found to be identical with the published sequence. However, by virtue of the cloning strategy employed there were three amino acids appended to the carboxy-terminus of the receptor, GlySerVal.<br>
II.  Yeast Străin Construction<br>
To create a yeast străin expressing the human A2a adenosine receptor, yeast străin CY8342 was used as the starting parental străin. The genotype of CY8342 is as follows: MATa farlD1442 tbtl-1 Iys2 ura3 Ieu2 trpl his3 fusl-HIS3 câni ste3D115S gpaD1163 ste!4::trpl::LYS2 gpalp-rGasE10K (or gpalp-rGasD229S or gpalp-rGasE10K+D229S)<br>
The genetic markers are as described in Example l, except for the G-protein variation. For human A2a receptor-expression. yeast strains were utilized in which the endogenous yeast G protein GPA1 hâd been deleted and replaced by a mammalian Gas. Three rât Gas mutants were utilized. These variants contain one or two point mutations which convert them into proteins which couple efficiently to yeast 3y- They are identified as G3.E10K (in which the glutamic acid at position ten is<br>
replaced with lysine) , Ga.D229S (in which the aspartic acid az position 229 is replaced wich serine) and Ga.E10K-i-D229S (whicr. contains both point mutations).<br>
Străin CY8342 (carrying one of the three mutant rât Gas proteins) was transformed with either the parental vector pLPBX (Receptor") or with pLPBX-A2a (Receptor*). A plasmid with the FUS1 promoter fused to 3-galactosidase codinc sequences (described in above) was added to assess the magnitude of activation of the pheromone resporise pathway.<br>
Funcţional Assay using Yeast Strains Expressing Human A: Adenosine Receptor<br>
In this example, the development of a funcţional screening assay in yeast for modulators of the human A: adenosine receptor is described.<br>
I.	Ligands Used in Assay<br>
Adenosine, a natural agonist for this receptor, as well as two other synthetic agonists were utilized for development of this assay. Adenosine, reported to have an EC5C of approximately 75 nM, and (-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (PIA) with a reported affinity of approximately 50 nM were used in a subset of experiments. 5'-N-ethylcarboxamido-adenosine (NEGA) was used in all growth assays. To prevent signaling due to the presence of adenosine in the growth media, adenosine deaminase (4U/ml) was added to all assays.<br>
II.	Biologica! Reaponaa in Yeast<br>
The ability of the A, adenosine receptor to functionally couple in a heterologous yeast system was assessed by introducing the A: receptor expression vector (p5095, described above) into a series of yeast strains that expressed different G protein subunits. The majority of these transformants expressed G„ subunits of the Gai or G00 subtype. Additional G0 proteins were also tested for the possible identification of promiscuous receptor-Ga protein coupling. In various strains, a STE18 or a chimeric STE18-<br>

As indicated in Table 3, the mosc robust si gria ling was found co occur in a yeast străin expressing the GPA:(41)-G„i3 chimera.<br>
III.  fusl-La.cZ Asaay<br>
i<br>
To characterize activation of the pheromone response pathway more fully, synthesis of 3-galactosidase through fuslLacZ in response to agonist stimulation was measured. To perfortn the 3-galactosadase assay, increasing concentrations of ligand were added to mid-log culture of human Aj adenosine receptor<br>
Gy2 construct was integrated into the genome cf the yeasc. The yeasc strains harbored a defective HIS3 gene and ar. incegrated copy of FUS1-HIS3, thereby allowing for seleccion in selective media containing 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole (tested at 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 înM) and lacking histidine. Transfortnants were isolated and monolayers were prepared on media containing 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole, 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase and lacking histidine. Five microliters of various concentrations of ligand (e. g., NECA at O, 0.1, l. O and 10 mM) was applied. Growth was monitored for 2 days. Ligand-dependent growth responses were tested in this manner in the various yeast strains. The results are summarized in Table l below. The symbol (-) indicates that ligand-dependent receptor activation was not detected while (+) denotes ligand-dependent response. The term "LIRMA" indicates ligand independent receptor mediated activation.<br>
expressed in a yeast străin co-expressing a SteiB-GY2 chimera and GPA41-Gai3. Transformants were isolated and growr. ovemight in the presence of histidine and 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase. After five hours of incubation with 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase and ligand, induction of 3-galactosidase was measured using CPRG as the substrate for 3-galactoside. 5 x 10 cells were used per assay.<br>
The results obtained with NECA stimulation indicated that at a NECA concentration of 10~ M approximately 2-fold stimulation of 3-galactosidase activity was achieved. Moreover, a stimulation index of approximately 10-fold was observed at a. NECA concentration of 10 M.<br>
The utility of this assay was extended by validation of the activity of antagonists on this străin. Two Jcnown adenosine antagonist, XAC and DPCPX, were tested for their ability to compete against NECA (at 5 mM) for activity in the 3-galactosidase assay. In these assays, 3-galactosidase induction was measured using FDG as the substrate and 1.6 x 10 cells per assay. The results indicated that both XAC and DPCPX served as potent antagonists of yeast-expressed A^ adenosine receptor, with IC$Q values of 44 nM and 49 nM, respectively.<br>
In order to determine if this inhibitory effect was specific to the A! subtype, a series of complementary experiments were performed with the yeast-based A2a receptor assay (described in Example 4) . Results obtained with the A,a yeast-based assay indicated that XAC was a relatively ef fective A2i receptor antagonist, consistent with published reports. In contrast, DPCPX was relatively inert at this receptor, as expected from published reports. ,<br>
IV.  Radioligand Binding<br>
The A: adenosine receptor assay was further characterized by measurement of the receptor's radioligand binding parameters. Displacement binding of [ H]CPX by several adenosine receptor<br>
reference compounds, XAC, DPCPX, and CGS, was analyzed usinc memfaranes prepared from yeast  expressing the număr; A adenosine receptor.   The results with yeast membranes expressing the human Ax adenosine receptor were compared to those from yeast membranes expressing the human A2a adenosine receptor or the human A3 receptor to examine the specificity of binding. To perform the assay, fifty mg of membranes were incubated with 0.4 nM [-H]CPX and increasing concentraticns of adenosine receptor ligands.  Incubation was in 50 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, l mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.25 % BSA and 2 U/ml adenosine deaminase in the presence of protease inhibitors for 60 minutes at room temperature.  Binding was terminated by addition of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 plus 10 mM MgCl2,  followed by rapid filtration over GF/B filters previously soaked with 0.5 % polyethyenimine, using a Packard 96-well" harvester.  Data were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve fitting procedure using Prism 2.01 software. The 1050 values obtained in this experiment are summarized in Table 4, below:<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
These data indicate that the reference compounds have affinities consistent with those reported in the literature. The data further indicate that the yeast-based assays are of sufficient sensitivity to discriminate receptor subtype specificity.<br>
Funcţional Assay using Yeast Scrains Expressing Huna.-. A2s Adenosine Receptor<br>
In this exatnple, the development of a funcţional screeninc assay in yeast for modulators of the human A: adenosine receptor is described.<br>
I.  Ligands Used in Assay<br>
The natural ligand adenosine, as well as other thoroughly characterized and commercially available ligands were used for study of the human A2a receptor functionally expressed in yeast.. Three ligands nave been used in the estafclishment of this assay. They include:<br>
Ligrand	Reportgd J	Funccian<br>
Adenosine	500 nM	agonist<br>
5' -N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine	10-15 nM	agonist<br>
(NECA) (-)-N6-(2-<br>
phenylisopropyl)-adenosine	100-125 nM	agonist<br>
(PIA)<br>
To prevent signaling due to the presence of adenosine in-the growth media, adenosine deaminase (4D/ml) was added to all assays.<br>
II.  Biologieal R«spona« in Yeast<br>
A2a receptor agonists were tested for the capacity to stimulate the pherotnone response pathway in yeast transformed with the A2a receptor expression plasmid and expressing either GasE10K, GasD229S or GQSE10K-fD229S. The ability of ligand to stimulate the pheromone response pathway in a receptor dependent manner was indicated by an alteration in the yeast phenotype. Receptor activation modified the phenotype from histidine auxotrophy to hilstidine prototrophy C activation of fusl-HIS3) . Three independent transformants were isolated and grown overnight in the presence of histidine. Cells were washed to remove histidine and diluted to 2 x 10 cells/ml. 5 ni of each transformant was spotted onto nonselective media (including histidine) or selective<br>
media (l mM AT) in the absence or presence cf 4 u/r.l adenosine deaminase. Plates were grovm at 30 "C for 24 hours. In the presenca of histidine both Receptor" (R") ane Receptor" (R~) strains were capable of growth. However, in the absence of histidine only R* cells grew. Since no ligand hâd been added to these plates two explanations were possibie for this result. One possibie interpretation was that the receptor bearing yeast were at a growth advantage due to Ligand Independent Receptor Mediated Activation (LIRMA). Altematively the yeast could have been synthesizing the ligand adenosine. To distinguish between these two possibilities, an enzyme which degrades the ligand, adenosine deaminase (ADA) , was added to the growing yeast and plates. In the presence of adenosine deaminase R* cells no longer grew in the absence of histidine, indicating that the yeast were indeed synthesizing ligand.<br>
This interpretation was confirmed by an A2a growth assay in liguid. In this experiment R"1" yeast (a GQSE10K străin expressing the A2a receptor) were inoculated at three densities (l x IO6 cell/ml; 3 x IO5 cells/ml; or l x IO5 cells/ml) in the presence or absence of adenosine deaminase (4 U/ml) . The stringency of the assay was enhanced with increasing concentrations (O, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mM)of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) , a competitive antagonist of imidazoleglycerol-P dehydratase, the protein product of the HIS3 gene. In the presence of adenosine deaminase and 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole yeast grew less vigorously. However in the absence of 3-amino-1, 2,4-triazole, adenosine deaminase hâd little effect. Thus adenosine deaminase itself hâd no direct effect upon the pheromone response pathway.<br>
An alternative approach to measuring growth and one that can be miniaturized for high throughput screening is an A2a receptor ligand spot assay. A GQSE10K străin expressing the A2a receptor (A2aR+) or lacking the receptor (R-) was grown overnighc in the presence of histidine and 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase. Cells were washed to remove histidine and diluted<br>
to S x 10° cells/ml. l x 10 °cells were spreac selective plates containing 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase ar.d 0.5 or 1.0 mM 3-amino-l,2,4-triazole (AT) and allowed to dry for l hour. 5 /zi of the following reagents were applied to the monolayer: 10 mM adenosine, 38.7 mM histidine, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) , 10 mM PIA or 10 mM NECA. Cells were grown 24 hours at 30°C. The results showed that cells without receptor could only grow when histidine was added to the media. In contrast, R* cells only grew in areas where the A2a receptor ligands PIA and NECA hâd been spotted. Since the plates contained adenosine deaminase, the lack of growth where adenosine hâd been spotted confirmed that adenosine deaminase was active.<br>
ZII.  fus l LacZ Asaay<br>
To quantitate activation of the yeast mating pathway, synthesis of 3-galactosidase through fuslLacZ was measured.<br>
Yeast strains expressing G„£10K, G^3D229S or G03E10K+D229S were transformed with a plastnid encoding the human A2a receptor (R+) or with a plasmid lacking the receptor (R-) . Transformants were isolated and grown overnight in the presence of histidine and 4 U/ml adenosine deaminase. l x 10 cells were diluted to l x 10 cells/ml and exposed to increasing concentrations of NECA for 4 hours, followed by determination of the 0-galactosidase activity in the cells. The results demonstrated that essentially no (3-galactosidase activity was detected in R- strains, whereas increasing amounts of 0-galactosidase activity were detected in R+ strains expressing either G.„E10K, G3SD229S or G,„E10K+D229S as the concentration of NECA increased, indicating a dose dependent increase in units of (3-galactosidase detected in response to exposure to increased ligand concentration. This dose dependency was only observed in cells expressing the A2a receptor. Furthermore the most potent Gaj construct for the A2a receptor was GOJE10K. The G„D229S construct was the second-most potent G,, construct for the A2a receptor, while the G3SE10Kt-D229S construct was the least potent of the three<br>
GaJ consrruccs tested, alchough even the G3.ElOK-r-D225S construct stimuiated readily detectable amounts of 5-galactosidase activity.<br>
