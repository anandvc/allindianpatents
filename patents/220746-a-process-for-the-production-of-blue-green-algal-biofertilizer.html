3. TECHNOLOGY PARAMETERS: A process for the production of blue green algal<br>
(BGA) biofertilizer.<br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to the selection or standardization of multiplication unit - glasshouse/polyhouse, formulation of medium for multiplication of BGA, pH of the formulated medium, quantity of inoculum, duration of mass multiplication of BGA in a multiplication pond, quantity of carrier to be used for the final product, final population of BGA per gram of carrier, and finally developed a technology package for the blue-green algal (BGA) biofertilizers. Biofertilizers have attained an important place in the modem agriculture. BGA biofertilizers are specific to rice and sugarcane crops and depending upon the soil type, availability of water provides 25-30 kg of biologically fixed nitrogen per hectare per cropping season. BGA biofertilizers also increases the availability of phosphorus, provides growth-promoting substances (vitamins and indole acetic acid) and improves soil structure by contributing organic carbon thus improves soil health and fertility. BGA biofertilizers also reclaim degraded wastelands like saline/alkali soils.<br>
The results of experimental trials and farmers fields are as follows:<br>
i. That in areas where chemical nitrogen use is either nil or in very small quantities, particularly in some of the districts of Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and eastern U.P, application of BGA biofertilizer without any chemical nitrogen fertilizer, a net increase of 15-20% in the crop yield is obtained.<br>
ii. In areas where chemical nitrogen fertilizer is used in small quantities (25-75 kg N/ha), a fertilizer dose to the extent of 25 kg N/ha can be reduced without any decrease in crop yield rather an additional 10-15% increase in crop is obtained.<br>
iii.Even at higher doses of fertilizer nitrogen, increased rice yield (15-20%) is obtained.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
Blue green algae (BGA) are photosynthetic organisms. Some of the BGA are capable of fixing atmospheric gaseous nitrogen in to ammonia with the help of enzyme nitrogenase and deriving energy from sunlight. In an area of one hectare it can provide about 25-30 kg of biologically fixed nitrogen in a period of 90 days. During its growth it also releases organic carbon, some growth promoting substances and thus if BGA biofertilizer is applied to rice crop it supplements 54-64 kg urea per hectare per season and an 10-15% increased crop yield. However, no suitable protocol or technology was available to produce it in bulk round the year. This was basically due to non-availability of cheaper growth media and suitable carrier. Similarly physiological growth parameters like pH of growth media, aeration, temperature, inoculum load and duration of growth were not standardized Hence the BGA biofertilizer was not available to the farming community.<br>
With the large number of limitations in the production of BGA biofertilizer with the soil-based method, a better protocol or technology was required For want of suitable protocols, the use of BGA biofertilizer was not popular among farming community. The<br>
present invention relates to the formulation of growth media, selection of suitable carrier and all the growth parameters pertaining to BGA biofertilizer production. The production should be feasible round the year hence can be produced industrially.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Prior to straw carrier based blue green algae (BGA) biofertilizer production technology a soil-based rural production methodology was available for which there were no takers. The main drawbacks were that production was done in troughs of GI sheets or directly in the fields either by placing polyethylene sheets or without sheets after digging the pits 6' x 3' x 9". The pits were to be made in an open area so as to receive sunlight for the entire day. To each pit 10 kg soil and 250 g single super phosphate was added and water was filled up to a height of 3-4". Starter culture (mixture) of Anabaena, Nostoc, Aulosira and Tolypothrix was to be inoculated per troughs or multiplication unit. To prevent insect breeding during multiplication carbofuran (3% granules, 20g/tray or unit) or Malathion 5-10ml of 50% was recommended. In hot summer months in about 3-4 weeks a thick mat formed. It was allowed to dry and the dried material along with soil was used as inoculum. The recommended rate of application was 10 kg per hectare. The production was discontinued during rainy and winter seasons.<br>
This method (Prior Art) suffered due to:<br>
i.     Production period was limited to summer months only, ii.     Soil in water was medium of growth which varied from region to region hence<br>
quality of product was not uniform,<br>
iii.     Wide fluctuations in population of BGA as exposed to external environment, iv.     High levels of contamination due to open production, v.     Slow production rate (3-4 weeks per harvest), vi.     Multiplication of 1 or maximum 2 strains at a time in mixed culture, vii.     Low population density, viii.     Bulky nature of final product hence quantity required is high (10 kg/hectare),<br>
and ix.     Increased cost of transportation.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A process for the production of blue green algal (BGA) biofertili/er was to be developed with the following objectives:<br>
i. To formulate a growth medium with known constituents and cheaper than the earlier known growth media to avoid soil as a source of nutrient and carrier.<br>
ii.        The medium should support faster growth rate than the known growth media, iii.       To select a carrier which is lightweight, cheap and better carrying capacity, iv.       To give inoculum of known and constant quantity of cells/gm carrier.<br>
v. To give product of known quality (all the culture should be present in a packet).<br>
vi.       To provide inoculum free of contamination.<br>
vii. That the technology should be operational round the year so that the labour is fully utilized with industrial implications.<br>
viii. To standardize the growth parameters (light, pH, temperature, and growth rate), drying and shelf life of the culture produced by formulated growth media.<br>
Overall, it was intended to develop commercially viable technology.<br>
THE INVENTION:<br>
The most significant aspect of this invention is the formulation of growth medium (food for growth of BGA), selection of carrier, selection of production site and production units, inoculum load, time of harvesting, drying and mixing of different culture before packing. The detail of entire protocol has been worked out<br>
1. The Technology: A process for the production of blue green algal (BGA) biofertilizer.<br>
1.1. Formulation of growth medium: Nonnally the growth media available in literature are designed for specific research work. Such media although support the growth of specific BGA but not suitable for mass cultivation of BGA biofertilizer. These growth media are commercially nonviable, as they are most expensive and not necessarily support fast growth rate for all the BGA biofertilizer strains. Therefore a new growth media was formulated for the cultivation of BGA biofertilizer strains with the objectives mat it is cheaper and higher growth rate per unit time of all BGA biofertilizer strains.<br>
The major absolute requirements for the growth of BGA are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, and magnesium. Elements like iron, manganese and trace metals like cobalt, zinc, molybdenum and copper also play significant role in growth of BGA. To provide major nutrients like phosphorus and potassium, commercially available fertilizers (single super phosphate and mureate of potash) were taken in a definite quantity. Since the biofertilizer strains are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, the formulated medium was devoid of combined/preformed nitrogen source. Most of the trace elements are present as impurities in phosphatic and potassic fertilizers hence the salts for calcium, sulphur, copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, citric acid and EDTA were not included in formulated medium. Magnesium the essential component of chlorophyll was supplied as magnesium sulphate. Finally growth media was formulated with Mureate of potash, super phosphate and magnesium sulphate. The required quantity per litre of growth media varies between 0.03-0.075 gram. The growth kinetics in the final formulated medium was found to be significantly superior to the earlier known media-BGn (BM). The growth rate of AuIosira sp., Tolypothrix sp., Nostoc sp. and Anabaena sp. in formulated medium (FM) was 0.025, 0.023, 0.018 and 0.026 per hour against<br>
0.012, 0.02, 0.013 and 0.015 per hour respectively in the BG-11 growth media. The cost of 1000 litre Formulated Medium was Rs. 12.60 against Rs. 48.15 for the BG-11 medium; hence, the formulated medium (FM) was much cheaper than the routinely used growth media for BGA biofertilizer strains. The constituent of FM and their quantity is one of the most important aspects and needs to be patented as the part of process/technology.<br>
1.2.	Inoculum carrier: To supply BGA biofertilizer strains, soil was being used traditionally.<br>
Soil as a carrier is heavy and has poor carrying capacity and varies from area to area thus<br>
amendments is needed. A large variety of carriers like riverbed sand, rice straw, wheat<br>
straw, sawdust, thermocol and polyurethane foam were investigated From a variety of<br>
carrier wheat straw was found to be best. This has been used for the first time as<br>
carrier of BGA biofertilizer. The carrying capacity of wheat straw was found to be<br>
more than 1,000,000 cells per gram carrier. Hence the use of wheat straw as carrier for<br>
BGA biofertilizer needs to be patented as apart of technology.<br>
1.3.	Starter culture: The initial inoculum load is very important parameter to determine the<br>
duration of multiplication, final biomass buildup as well as time of harvesting to obtain<br>
desired population density in the final product. During the development of process for<br>
BGA biofertilizer strains production initial inoculum load was  standardized.<br>
Accordingly each strain of BGA grown in pure cultures in laboratory and multiplied<br>
independently. Initially 500 millilitre 10 days old culture (about 3 gram) is inoculated<br>
per pond initially for 2 days. Subsequently, dry inoculum from the material produced<br>
there itself can be used. Hence, the quantity of wet biomass per multiplication unit of<br>
specific size is important to provide final a final yield of 1,000,000 cells per gram carrier<br>
and is important aspect needs patenting.<br>
1.4.	Strategies to reduce the contamination in final inoculum: To reduce the external aerial<br>
contamination in the final product, the multiplication ponds to be constructed in a<br>
polyethylene house/ glasshouse. The dimensions of poly- or glasshouse vary depending<br>
on the investment proposed. The smallest size of glasshouse can be of 12.6m x 5.6m x<br>
8m. The multiplication ponds are of two types (a) polyethylene lined shallow pits, or (b)<br>
made of RCC. Aeration is achieved by providing windows on one-side and exhaust fans<br>
on the opposite wall. The air is sucked through muslin cloth filters. The use of such<br>
filters in glasshouse for BGA biofertilizer production is for the first time and should be patented as the part of the process/technology.<br>
1.5.	Strains used for BGA biofertilizer: Anabaena variabilis, Nostoc muscorum, Aulosira<br>
fertilissima and Tolypothrix tenuis.<br>
1.6.	Multiplication site: The multiplication unit should be constructed in open away from<br>
shade of trees, so as to receive maximum sunlight during the day.<br>
1.7.	Physical growth parameters:<br><br>
1.7.1.	pH: By growing the four BGA biofertilizer strains in formulated medium at different<br>
pH levels it was observed that the best growth rate (by factor of 2) was achieved in<br>
medium with near neutral to mild saline pH. This particular pH is employed in the<br>
current technology.<br>
1.7.2.	Temperature: The temperature range for growth of all the BGA strains varies from 25-<br>
45Â°C. However, the optimum temperature for growth is from 32-37Â°C and for nitrogen<br>
fixation from 29-35Â°C. To maintain the temperature particularly in whiter months in<br>
northern India heat convectors (2) are provided whereas in summer temperature is<br>
controlled through exhaust fans. The use of either heat convectors or exhaust fans for<br>
BGA biofertilizer is for the first time hence as a part of technology should be<br>
patented.<br>
1.7.3.	Light: BGA biofertilizer strains can grow at a very broad light range i.e. from 1000 lux<br>
to 45,000 lux. For indoor cultivation, light intensity of 1800 - 3500 lux would support<br>
growth of BGA biofertilizer strains and this is achieved by providing artificial light<br>
source. In a multi-tier system one white light and one yellow light illuminate only lower<br>
tiers by 100-watt bulb. Providing the artificial light for lower tier has been<br>
demonstrated for the first time hi BGA biofertilizer production process hence needs<br>
patenting.<br>
1.8.	Harvesting: Once BGA strains produce enough biomass in formulated medium i.e. about<br>
5 times in a period of 3-5 days the cultures are harvested. Harvesting is done by mixing<br>
the BGA biomass in a known quantity of carrier and removed immediately from the multiplication pits.<br>
1.9.	Drying: Natural sunlight is employed for drying the product. Drying should be done mat<br>
the final moisture content is low (15%) and does not support the bacterial growth in<br>
product. Keeping moisture percentage greater than 15 will lead to the deterioration of<br>
product whereas less than 15% moisture will reduce the survival and shelf life of product.<br>
1.10.	Packing and Storage of BGA biofertilizer: The individual BGA strains are mixed<br>
before packing hi suitable fresh bag. All the four strains are in equal proportion and<br>
sealed.<br>
1.11.	Population density: The straw based BGA biofertilizer was found to contain more than<br>
1,000,000 propagules or cells per gram of carrier.  BGA biofertilizer with lesser<br>
population density will not give desired benefits.<br>
1.12 Shelf life: The shelf life of this BGA biofertilizer is 2 years when stored in dry ventilated room.<br>
The application:<br>
Since the BGA biofertilizer produced by this technology is of assured quality i.e. containing all the four BGA strains and of known population size 1,000,000 cells per gram carrier only 1 kg BGA biofertilizer per hectare (400 gram per acre) is enough to provide the desired benefits. It should be applied by broadcasting immediately after rice seedling transplantation.<br><br><br><br><br>
