				<td>PURINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS MODULATORS OF TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 7<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application relates generally to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions which selectively activates toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), and methods of making and using them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The innate immune system provides the body with a first line defense against invading pathogens. In an innate immune response, an invading pathogen is recognized by a germline-encoded receptor, the activation of which initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the induction of cytokine expression. Innate immune system receptors have broad specificity, recognizing molecular structures that are highly conserved among different pathogens. One family of these receptors is known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), due to their homology with receptors that were first identified and named in Drosophila, and are present in cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells.<br>
There are at least ten different TLRs in mammals. Ligands and corresponding signaling cascades have been identified for some of these receptors. For example, TLR2 is activated by the lipoprotein of bacteria (e.g., E. coli.), TLR3 is activated by double-stranded RNA, TLR4 is activated by lipopolysaccharide (i.e., LPS or endotoxin) of Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Salmonella and E. coli Ol57:H7), TLR5 is activated by flagellin of motile bacteria (e.g., Listeria), TLR7 recognizes and responds<br>
to imiquimod and TLR9 is activated by unmethylated CpG sequences of pathogen DNA. The stimulation of each of these receptors leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-KB, and other signaling molecules that are involved in regulating the expression of cytokine genes, including those encoding tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and certain chemokines.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery by the applicants that a number of small molecules can alter TLR-mediated immunostimulatory signaling.

Compounds of Formula I or II which have such stability are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention.<br>
"Heteroalkyl" refers to an alkyl group where one or more carbon atoms have been replaced with a heteroatom, such as, O, N, or S. For example, if the carbon atom of the alkyl group which is attached to the parent molecule is replaced with a heteroatom (e.g., O, N, or S) the resulting heteroalkyl groups are, respectively, an alkoxy group (e.g., -OCH3, etc.), an amine (e.g., -NHCH3, -N(CH3)2, etc.), or a thioalkyl group (e.g., -SCH3). If a non-terminal carbon atom of the alkyl group which is not attached to the parent molecule is replaced with a heteroatom (e.g., O, N, or S) and the resulting heteroalkyl groups are, respectively, an alkyl ether (e.g., -CH2CH2-O-CH3, etc.), an alkyl amine (e.g., -CH2NHCH3, -CH2N(CH3)2 etc.), or a thioalkyl ether (e.g.,-CH2-S-CH3). If a terminal carbon atom of the alkyl group is replaced with a heteroatom (e.g., O, N, or S), the resulting heteroalkyl groups are, respectively, a hydroxyalkyl group (e.g., -CH2CH2-OH), an aminoalkyl group (e.g., -CH2NH2), or an<br>
alkyl thiol group (e.g., -CH2CH2-SH). A heteroalkyl group can have, for example, 1 to 20 carbon atoms, 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or 1 to 6 carbon atoms. A C1-C6 heteroalkyl group means a heteroalkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>

"Enantiomers" refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.<br>
Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A<br>
50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.<br>
Protecting Groups<br>
In the context of the present invention, protecting groups include prodrug moieties and chemical protecting groups.<br>
Protecting groups are available, commonly known and used, and are optionally used to prevent side reactions with the protected group during synthetic procedures, i.e. routes or methods to prepare the compounds of the invention. For the most part the decision as to which groups to protect, when to do so, and the nature of the chemical protecting group "PG" will be dependent upon the chemistry of the reaction to be protected against {e.g., acidic, basic, oxidative, reductive or other conditions) and the intended direction of the synthesis. The PG groups do not need to be, and generally are not, the same if the compound is substituted with multiple PG. In general, PG will be used to protect functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, thio, or amino groups and to thus prevent side reactions or to otherwise facilitate the synthetic efficiency. The order of deprotection to yield free, deprotected groups is dependent upon the intended direction of the synthesis and the reaction conditions to be encountered, and may occur in any order as determined by the artisan.<br>
Various functional groups of the compounds of the invention may be protected. For example, protecting groups for -OH groups (whether hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, or other functions) include "ether- or ester-forming groups". Ether- or ester-forming groups are capable of functioning as chemical protecting groups in the synthetic schemes set forth herein. However, some hydroxyl and thio protecting groups are neither ether- nor ester-forming groups, as<br>
will be understood by those skilled in the art, and are included with amides, discussed below.<br>
A very large number of hydroxyl protecting groups and amide-forming groups and corresponding chemical cleavage reactions are described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1999, ISBN 0-471-16019-9) ("Greene"). See also Kocienski, Philip J.; Protecting Groups (Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. In particular Chapter 1, Protecting Groups: An Overview, pages 1-20, Chapter 2, Hydroxyl Protecting Groups, pages 21-94, Chapter 3, Diol Protecting Groups, pages 95-117, Chapter 4, Carboxyl Protecting Groups, pages 118-154, Chapter 5, Carbonyl Protecting Groups, pages 155-184. For protecting groups for carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, phosphonate, sulfonic acid and other protecting groups for acids see Greene as set forth below. Such groups include by way of example and not limitation, esters, amides, hydrazides, and the like.<br>
Ether- and Ester-forming protecting groups<br>
Ester-forming groups include: (1) phosphonate ester-forming groups, such as phosphonamidate esters, phosphorothioate esters, phosphonate esters, and phosphon-bis-amidates; (2) carboxyl ester-forming groups, and (3) sulphur ester-forming groups, such as sulphonate, sulfate, and sulfinate.<br>
Metabolites of the Compounds of the Invention<br>
Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the compounds described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification and the like of the administered compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, the invention includes compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a<br>
compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled (e.g., C14 or H3) compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention even if they possess no anti-infective activity of their own.

The definitions and substituents for various genus and subgenus of the present compounds are described and illustrated herein. It should be understood by one skilled in the art that any combination of the definitions and substituents described above should not result in an inoperable species or compound. "Inoperable species or compounds" means compound structures that violates relevant scientific principles (such as, for example, a carbon atom connecting to more than four covalent bonds) or compounds too unstable to permit isolation and formulation into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms. For example, it is understood to one skilled in the art that the definition of L2 as a covalent bond only applies to Formula I, and not to Formula II.<br>
Similarly, the skilled artisan will understand that when L2 is -NH-, -O-, or -S-, in Formula II, L2 defines a =NH (imine), =0 (carbonyl), or =S (thiocarbonyl) group.<br>

(Table Removed ) Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
The compounds of this invention are formulated with conventional carriers and excipients, which will be selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain excipients, glidants, fillers, binders and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form, and when intended for delivery by other than oral administration generally will be isotonic. All formulations will optionally contain excipients such as those set forth in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (1986), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Excipients include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin, hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like. The pH of the formulations ranges from about 3 to about 11, but is ordinarily about 7 to 10.<br>
While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it may be preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations of the invention, both for veterinary and for human use, comprise at least one active ingredient, together with one or more acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration<br>
routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and<br>
may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.), herein incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active<br>
ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In<br>
general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient.<br>
For administration to the eye or other external tissues e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc.), preferably 0.2 to 15% w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.<br>
If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and<br>
polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.<br>
The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween® 60, Span® 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. The cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils are used.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations according to the present invention comprise one or more compounds of the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the active ingredient may be in any form suitable for the intended method of administration. When used for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation.

These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.<br>
Formulations for oral use may be also presented as hard gelatin capsules where the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oil suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oral suspensions may contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth herein, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules of the invention suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those disclosed above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, a mineral oil, such as liquid paraffin, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, such as soybean lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsion may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, such as glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, a flavoring or a coloring agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned herein. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg<br>
of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 ug of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL/hr can occur.<br>
Formulations suitable for administration to the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% particularly about 1.5% w/w.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.<br>
Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 µm (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 µm in increments such as 0.5 µm, 1 µm, 30 µm, 35 µm, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis of infections as described herein.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and nonaqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.<br>
The formulations are presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.<br>
The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier.<br>
Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.<br>
 <br>
Compounds of the invention can also be formulated to provide controlled release of the active ingredient to allow less frequent dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of the active ingredient. Accordingly, the invention also provided compositions comprising one or more compounds of the invention formulated for sustained or controlled release.<br>
The effective dose of an active ingredient depends at least on the nature of the condition being treated, toxicity, whether the compound is being used prophylactically (lower doses) or against an active disease or condition, the method of delivery, and the pharmaceutical formulation, and will be determined by the clinician using conventional dose escalation studies. The effective dose can be expected to be from about 0.0001 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day, typically from about 0.001 to about 1 mg/kg body weight per day, more typically from about 0.01 to about 1 mg/kg body weight per day, even more typically from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day. For example, the daily candidate dose for an adult human of approximately 70 kg body weight will range from about 0.05 mg to about 100 mg, or between about 0.1 mg and about 25 mg, or between about 0.4 mg and about 4 mg, and may take the form of single or multiple doses.<br>

b)	a second pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one additional active agent selected from the group consisting of interferons, ribavirin or its analogs, HCV NS3 protease inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase 1 inhibitors, hepatoprotectants, nucleoside or nucleotide inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase, non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase, HCV NS5A inhibitors, TLR-7 agonists, cyclophillin inhibitors, HCV IRES inhibitors, pharmacokinetic enhancers, and other drugs for treating HCV, or mixtures thereof.<br>
It is also possible to combine any compound of the invention with one or more other active agents in a unitary dosage form for simultaneous or sequential administration to a patient. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations.<br>
Co-administration of a compound of the invention with one or more other active agents generally refers to simultaneous or sequential administration of a compound of the invention and one or more other active agents, such that therapeutically effective amounts of the compound of the invention and one or more other active agents are both present in the body of the patient.<br>
Co-administration includes administration of unit dosages of the compounds of the invention before or after administration of unit dosages of one or more other active agents, for example, administration of the compounds of the invention within seconds, minutes, or hours of the administration of one or more other active agents. For example, a unit dose of a compound of the invention can be administered first, followed within seconds or minutes by administration of a unit dose of one or more other active agents. Alternatively, a unit dose of one or more other active agents can be administered first, followed by administration of a unit dose of a compound of the invention within seconds or minutes. In some cases, it may be desirable to administer a unit dose of a compound of the invention first, followed, after a period of hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration of a unit dose of one or more other active agents. In other cases, it may be desirable to administer a unit dose of one or more other active agents first, followed, after a period of hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration of a unit dose of a compound of the invention.<br>
The combination therapy may provide "synergy" and "synergistic effect", i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., in separate tablets, pills or capsules, or by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.<br>

m-xylene (2.52 g, 9.56 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (1.32 g, 9.56<br>
mmol) were combined in DMF (10 mL) and stirred at ambient temperature for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (120 mL), washed with water (2x), brine, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under vacuum. The crude product was purified by chromatography on silica gel with 0-10% methanol in ethyl acetate as eluent. Evaporation of the appropriate fractions gave 9-(3-Bromomethyl-berizyl)-2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-9H-purin-6-ylarnine (2) (1.1 g, 2.80 mmol, 59%). MS: 392/394 (MH+).<br>

9-(3-Bromomethyl-benzyl)-2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-9H-purin-6-ylamine (2) (1 g, 2.54 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (10 mL). N-bromosuccinimide (1.5 g, 8.4 mmol) was added in portions over 5 min. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hour, then diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL), washed with 10% aqueous Na2S2O3 solution, and brine, dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated under vacuum. The crude 8-Bromo-9-(3-bromomethyl-benzyl)-2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-9H-purin-6-ylamine (3) (-1 g) was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Example A<br>
Crude 8-Bromo-9-(3-bromomethyl-benzyl)-2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-9H-purin-6-ylamine (3) (~1 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) and pyrrolidine (1 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight and then evaporated under vacuum. The residue (4) was dissolved in methanol (20 mL) and 50% aqueous KOH (2 mL) was added. The mixture was heated under reflux until HPLC analysis indicated complete disappearance of starting material (~3 hours). Then the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and concentrated aq. HC1 was added (5 mL). Heating under reflux was continued for 1 hour after which the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The solid residue was extracted 3x with methanol to separate from salts. The methanol solution was<br>
evaporated under vacuum and the crude product was purified by reverse phase preparative HPLC (5-45% acetonitrile/40 mM aqueous HC1) giving 6-Amino-2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)-9-(3-pyrrolidin-l-ylmethyl-benzyl)-9H-purin-8-ol (Example A) (450 mg, 1.13 mmol) as yellowish solid as the HC1 salt.<br>

(Scheme Removed ) Compound 33<br>
A sample of the 2-butoxy-8-methoxy-9H-purin-6-amine TFA salt (7.58 g) was dissolved in CH3CN (400 ml) and treated with CS2CO3 (21.1 g) at 23 °C for 5 min. 3-(bromomethyl)-benzaldehyde (4.27 g) was then added. Once the reaction was gauged complete using LCMS and HPLC, it was filtered through a plug of Na2SO4 over a glass frit. The filtrate was concentrated to an orange soild. A minimum of warm glacial AcOH (30 mL) was used to dissolve the solid with stirring in an oil bath at 80 °C. H2O (54 mL) was added slowly with mild stirring. Clouding was persistent, so the reaction was allowed to cool to 23 °C in the oil bath. An orange oil began to coagulate out of the mother liquor. More glacial AcOH (5 mL) was added, but the oil failed to resorb into the mother liquor. The mixture was cooled in a refridgerator overnight, and the orange oil solidified. The mother liquor was decanted away, and almost immediately, white crystals began to grow. These crystals proved to be 95% pure compound 33 (~1.5 g), which was captured via filtration. The orange solidified oil could be purified on silica gel (DCMrMeOH, 98:2,<br>

Once the reaction was gauged complete using LCMS and HPLC analysis, 12 M aq HC1 (300 µL) was added. The next day, 1.0 M aq HC1 (1.0 mL) was added to aid conversion. Once the reaction had reached completion, the entire reaction was directly purified on a C-18 reversed-phase HPLC column (eluent: 0.5% w/v aq HC1 + CH3CN; 5/90 to 100:0), giving amine BD (85.5 mg, 81% yield) as a yellow gum after lyophilization 1H NMR (DMSO) δ:0.89 (t, 3H), 1.32-1.38 (m, 2H), 1.57-1.63 (m, 2H), 1.90-2.12 (m, 5H), 3.07-3.21 (m, 4H), 4.12 (t, 2H), 4.28-4.32 (m, 2H), 4.89 (s, 2H), 7.36-7.44 (m, 4H), 10.04 (bs, 1H), 10.28 (s, 1H); MS: 429 (MH+).<br>

To a solution of aldehyde 33 (230 mg) in MeOH (-10 mL) was added homopiperidine (aka hexamethyleneimine) (270 µL). Glacial AcOH (100 µL) and NaHB(OAc)3 (307 mg) were introduced, and the reaction was stirred at 23 °C for 12 hrs. Once the reaction was determined to be complete using LCMS and HPLC analysis, the crude Schiff base was purified by PREP HPLC. All product fractions were combined, neutralized with an excess of K2CO3, concentrated to remove acetonitrile, and extracted with EtOAc (3 x 30 mL).

TLR7 Reporter Assay protocol<br>
A. HEK293 Assay<br>
1.	Cell culture:<br>
HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human TLR7 gene and a pNiFty™ NF-kB inducible luciferase reporter plasmid were obtained from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). DMEM/F12 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen-Strep), Blasticidin and Zeocine were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The HEK293/TLR7/Luciferase cell line was constructed by transfecting stably the HEK293/TLR7 cells with the pNiFty plasmid. Cells were grown in the DMEM/F12 medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, supplemented with 1X Pen-Strep, 10 µg/mL Blasticidin and 5 µg/mL Zeocin.<br>
2.	Assay procedure:<br>
For the determination of the EC50 and Emax values of TLR7 agonists in the<br>
reporter assay, 20 µL of 2X test concentration of serial diluted compound in cell<br>
culture medium was added to each well of a white, clear-bottomed 384-well cell<br>
culture plate from Corning (Corning, NY). To this plate, 20 µL of cell culture<br>
medium containing 12,000 HEK293/TLR7/Luciferase cells was dispensed to each<br>
well. The plate was then placed in incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) and incubated for 2<br>
days. After the incubation, 40 µL of the pre-mixed lysis buffer/luciferase substrate<br>
solution was dispensed into each well. The lysis buffer (5X) and luciferase substrate<br>
was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and they were mixed at 2:3 (v/v) ratio<br>
mmediately prior to use. After 10 minutes of incubation at room temperature, the luminescence signal was measured using a VictorLight plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA) with an integration time of 0.1 seconds per sample.<br>
Data analysis was performed with Prism software from GraphPad (San Diego, CA) using a single site binding algorithm. The maximum signal for each test compound (Emax) was normalized with the maximum signal for the positive control, Resiquimod, on each plate. The concentration of a compound that corresponds to 50% of the maximum signal is defined as the EC50.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have HCV EC50 values (uM) in the range of about 0.01 to about 1000, or about 0.1 to about 500, or about 0.1 to about 300, or about 0.1 to about 200, or about 0.1 to about 100, or about 0.1 to about 50, or less than about 500, or less than about 400, or less than about 300, or less than about 200, or less than about 100, or less than about 50, or less than about 20, or less than about 10. B. PBMC Assay<br>
Assays were conducted to determine cytokine stimulation at 24 hours from human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PMBC) using the compounds of the present invention. The assays were run in duplicate, with 8-point, half-log dilution curves. The compounds of the present invention were diluted from 10 µM DMSO solution. Cell supernatants are assayed directly for IFNα and 1:10 dilution for TNFα. The assays were performed in a similar fashion as described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16,4559, (2006). Specifically, cryo-preserved PBMCs were thawed and seeded 96 well plates with 750,000 cells/well in 190µL/well cell media. The PBMCs were then incubated for 1 hour at 37°C at 5% CO2. Then, the compounds of the present invention were added in l0µL cell media at 8 point, half-log dilution titration. The plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours and then spinned at 1200rpm for l0min, which was followed by collecting supernatant and storing the same at -80°C. Cytokine secretion was assayed with Luminex and<br>
Upstate multi-plex kits, using a Luminex analysis instrument.   IFN ECmax value for a compound was the concentration at which the compound stimulated maximum IFN α production as determined using the assay method above.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have IFN ECmax values (nM) in the range of about 0.1 to about 10,000, or about 0.1 to about 1,000, or about 0.1 to about 300, or about 0.1 to about 100, or about 0.1 to about 10, or about 0.1 to about 5, or about 0.1 to about 1, or less than about 5000, or less than about 3000, or less than about 1000, or less than about 500, or less than about 400, or less than about 300, or less than about 200, or less than about 100, or less than about 50, or less than about 20, or less than about 10, or less than about 5, or less than about 1. Examples A, C, D, F, J, N, R, W, Y, AI, AJ, AQ, AS, AU, AV, AW, AZ, BE, BG, BH, and BM have IFN ECmax values (nM) of less than about 5.<br>
