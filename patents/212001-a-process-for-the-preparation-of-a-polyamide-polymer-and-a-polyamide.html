PREPARATION OF CROSS-LINKED 2-DIMENSIONAL POLYMERS WITH<br>
SIDEDNESS FROM α,β-LACTONES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
(1)  Field of the Invention<br>
The   present   invention  provides   polymeric compositions and processes for synthesizing the polymer compositions.  The process is a polymerization reaction involving a cyclic α,β-unsaturated lactone and a long chain primary amine.  The polymer compositions self-assemble and can form sheets with a polar face and a non-polar face, two polar faces, or two non-polar faces wherein the "face" is defined as the opposed sides of the sheet.  Preferably, the polymer compositions are polyamides synthesized from 2 {5H)-furanone.  The present invention further provides polymer compositions and processes for synthesizing the polymer compositions from 2(5H)-furanone for uses as hydrogels, polymers that can bind metals and form complexes that are soluble in organic solvents, polymers for use as flocculants in water purification, polymers for use on non-fouling surfaces for biofilm suppression, polymers for use on non-thrombogenic surfaces, and polymers with uses as thin  conductive  films  for  microchips  and  other electronic devices.<br>
(2)  Description of the Related Art<br>
In the past, the desirable physical properties of organic polymers were simple. Of interest were ordinary attributes such as transparency, flexibility, heat and electrical conductance, water resistance., and pliability. These physical requirements could be met by any one of a wide variety of polymeric materials fabricated by one of several polymerizing reactions. These reactions include the simple polymerization of<br><br>
alkenes (e.g. polypropylene and polyvinylchloride), the condensation of acids and bases .to form polyesters, or acids and amines to form polyamides.<br>
More recently/  there has been much effort to fabricate  organic  polymeric  materials  with  more sophisticated properties.  These include materials that can  conduct  electricity,  that  are magnetic,  and materials that change some property such as color or refractive index under the influence of various external factors such as pressure, electric fields, magnetic fields, pH changes, or temperature alterations.  In all of these applications, one critical requirement is that some functional group or groups along the polymer backbone be aligned in a regular repeating fashion with very high density.   Polymeric materials with very different properties can be made depending on the choice of the functional groups.  Electron donor-acceptor pairs can be conductive or have optical properties that are influenced by electric or magnetic fields.   Such polymeric materials have applications in sensor devices and optical switches.  An array of negatively charged groups is a typical arrangement sought for conducting organic polymers where the charge carriers are metal ions and protons.  Hydrogels can be formed if charges are present on the side chains. Materials with special conductive, magnetic or electro-optical properties can be fabricated from polymers having specialized aromatic side chains.<br>
There are several methods for introducing side chains to a main chain polymer. One strategy is to add the side chains to the preformed main chain. This is generally not satisfactory because of the lack of predictability and reproducibility of stoichiometry, under-derivitization for stearic reasons, difficulty in accessing the interior of the polymer, poor solubility<br><br>
of the polymer/ and inefficient coupling reactions. Alternatively, the desired side chain can be attached to each polymer monomer prior to chain formation.  This method is generally more efficient but the subsequent coupling of the monomers often requires activating groups to be attached to one or both coupling sites. For  example/  the  preparation  of  polyesters  and polyamides require that the carboxylic acid function be activated before chain formation. Afterwards, the spent activating group has to be removed from the product. Radical polymerization cannot be used for side chains that contain unsaturations or heteroatoms such as sulfur which  act  as  quenching  agents  for  radicals. Furthermore, side chains containing reactive groups such as carboxylic acids often have to be protected before coupling.   Finally, synthesis of most polymers is dependent on fossil fuels, which is a non-renewable resource that is rapidly being depleted, and is a major import product which affects the balance of trade.<br>
Examples of polymers that are polyamides which can be synthesized from renewable resources are set forth below. U.S. Patent No. 2,274,831 to Hill discloses polyamides and the preparation of polyamides by polymerizing amino acids containing as a heteroatom a tertiary amino nitrogen or by reacting diamines and dibasic acids, either or both of which contain a hetero atom of tertiary amino nitrogen. U.S. Patent No. 2,691,643 to Chirtel et ai. discloses preparation of polypeptides of beta-alanine and amide forming derivatives of beta-alanine, beta-alanine alkyl esters, beta-alanine amides by self-condensation to produce water insoluble polypeptides which are useful for forming synthetic edible films. U.S. Patent No. 2,786/045 to Chirtel et aJ. discloses polymers of hydroxyacyl-amino acids and their polymers for the<br><br>
preparation of tough, elastic fibers and films • U.S. Patent No. 2,968,629 to Thompson discloses a method of inhibiting metal corrosion using a condensation product of beta-lactone. U.S. Patent No. 3,525,718 to Derieg et aJ. discloses a process for producing a polyamide resin from beta-lactone. The process consists of reacting beta-lactone under anhydrous conditions at reduced temperatures to produce an amino acid addition product, and then in a subsequent step subjecting said product to polymerization conditions at elevated temperatures in which said product is substantially dehydrated to form a polyamide resin which is linear without side chains. The resin has properties that suggest it may be used in applications where nylon and Dacron have been used. All of the abovementioned inventions disclose processes to make a specific product. None of the above mentioned inventions disclose processes for synthesizing a wide variety of polymers with distinct properties.<br>
Therefore, there is still a need for a good general method that allows the assembly of a continuous array of side chains along a polymer backbone in a quick and efficient manner. The preferred method is one that does not require activation of groups of the monomer(s), does not produce any by products that have to be eliminated, that proceeds under mild conditions, that is compatible with a large spectrum of functional groups including alcohols, acids, phosphate groups, sulfonates, nitriles, amides and 'amines, and which can be carried out in a wide variety of solvents from aprotic solvents to water. Because most polymers are derived from fossil fuels which are a limited resource and a resource that for the most part is imported, there is a need for said polymers be derived from renewable resources.<br>

One of the major tasks facing the chemical industry is the identification and development of high volume, renewable, commercially viable raw materials that can replace in large part the chemical industry's reliance on oil-based materials for manufacture of plastics, chemicals, and polymers.<br>
The focus of the present invention is a process for preparing a variety of new polymer or polyamides with unusual and unique properties starting from α,β-unsaturated lactones such as 2 {5H)-furanone. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,292,939; 5,319,110 and 5,374,773, all to Hollingsworth and herein incorporated by reference, a process is disclosed which utilizes a hexose source such as lactose for the synthesis. of 2 (5H) -furanone.. The inventor has discovered that 2 (5H)-furanone can be used in a process to make polyamides or polymers which process and polymers are the object of the present invention. Polymers derived from lactose have the appeal that they are derived from a renewable resource. The chemical functionalities which can be imparted to polymers derived from 2 (5H)-furanone are many. The chemical functionality available from 2(5H)-furanone<br><br>
compliments that obtained from alkenes such as propylene/ ethylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, and styrene, all of these are very common monomers used to make polymers.<br>
Condensation of 2 (5H)-furanone with a variety of monofunctional or bifunctional amines followed by ring opening of the resulting lactone to give polyamides 1s an object of the present invention. Using the method of the present invention, cationic as well as anionic and neutral polymers can be made which are dependent on the nature of the side group (R) . The R group can also be very long alkyl chains which generates bipolar monolayer structures in which the head group 1s part of a polyamide chain (Figure lA) . The R group can also be a molecular system with special optical or electrical properties (Figure 1B), crown ethers (Figure 1C), polyamines with high metal complexation or ion-capture properties (Figure 1D) or carboxylates with cation exchange or capture properties (Figure 1E) . Examples of uses for such polymer compositions prepared according to the method of the present invention are thin films for electronics through organic conductors, hydrogels, flocculants, nanostructures, and high-capacity ion exchange resins for use in precious or toxic metal recovery and water purification or reclamation. Therefore, the present invention 1s a process for synthesizing highly functionalized and functionalizable new polymeric materials capable of a wide variety of uses from starch or lactose derived monomers. The ability of the present invention for forming charged, neutral, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, electro-active, optically active, magnetically active or other types of polymers from one generalized reaction parallels the well-known radical polymerization of propylene, ethylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, styrene, and<br>
«<br><br>
other alkenes to form polymers with different physical properties. The present invention represents a departure for polymer chemistry from reliance on fossil fuels towards a direction in which agriculturally-derived materials are used as the primary building block. , Furthermore, the present invention provides processes for the synthesis of new and novel polymer compositions. The polymers of the present invention, when having an R group, form two-dimensional polymers which means that one end of the polymer, the headgroup which forms the backbone, 1s different from the other end, the R group which forms the side chains.<br>
The present invention also provides an opportunity to integrate biopolymers within the polyamide frameworks such as incorporation of biopolymers including but not limited to starch, chitin, chitosan, or cellulose into the reaction mixtures to achieve grafting or bonding. Furthermore, the functionalities present provides some measure of biodegradability for the polymers according to the present invention.<br>
Applications for the polymer compositions of the present invention are, but are not limited to, 1) thin conductive films for electronic or electro-magnetic devices, 2) hydrogels with high water capacity for medical and new mechanical-electrical applications, 3) conductive polymers, 4) polyamino-polyamides for metal recovery, and for use as a flocculant in water purification, 5) non-fouling surfaces for biofilm suppression, 6) non-thrombogenic surfaces, and 7) as micelles or liposome or adjuvants for drug delivery.<br>
The polymerization reaction of the present invention involves a cyclic a, (3-unsaturated gamma-lactone and a long chain primary amine. The long alkyl chains stack in a parallel manner and are held together by hydrophobic forces thereby forming an extended two-<br><br>
dimensional sheet. The terminus of the alkyl chain can be a saturated alkyl group such as methyl, 1sopropyl or 1sobutyl group or 1t can be a polar group, such as hydroxyl, nitrile, or amide, or an unsaturated function such as an alkene, acetylene or aryl group • Furtheisaore, the group can be any functionality that does not interfere with reaction of the amino group with the α,β-unsaturated gamma-lactone. These functionalities can also appear at any position along the alkyl chains thereby giving the polymers special properties such as a band of polar groups (in the case of hydroxyl functions) or a band of stacked n functions (in the case of alkenes, acetylenes, or arenes) • These polymer compositions can be used for light or electron conduction or for conferring special magnetic or optical properties or for further polymerization. The polymers can be ordered by allowing them to form at the interface between a polar and a non-polar layer, e.g. the interface between water and ether. The polymers can be used to replace Langmuir Blodgett layers in most applications since the hydroxyl groups on the polar faces can be converted to a wide variety of functionalities by standard chemical techniques. These include but are not limited to acids, esters, amines, amides, nitriles, phosphates, phosphonates, sulfate, thiol, and halo groups.<br>
The present invention particularly uses an α,β-unsaturated gamma-lactone (2(5H)-furanone or butenolide) as an agent to effect the regular, sequential alignment of side chains along a polyamide backbone. The method 1s based on the reactivity of the furanone which undergoes facile reaction with a primary amine by Michael-type addition to yield a, 3-amino gamma-lactone which then polymerizes to form a polyamide chain with the pendant side chain.  Depending on the side group<br><br>
(R) , the method of the present invention can produce many different types of new compositions.<br>
When the R group 1s a saturated long-chain alkyl group, two-dimensional polymer compositions in which the hydrophobic alkyl chains are on one face and the polar hydroxyraethyl groups on the other face are fabricated. Two-dimensional  polymer  compositions  are  prepared according to the method of the present invention by heating one equivalent of furanone with the appropriate primary amine.  To prepare polymer compositions with shorter chain amines that are liquid no solvent 1s needed except that dilution with a high boiling point solvent such as toluene 1s preferred.   To prepare compositions with longer chain amines which are solids, tetradecylamine 1s an example, a solvent 1s required to dissolve  the  longer  chain  amine.    The  polymer compositions prepared according to the method of the present invention can be used for coating plastics to render the plastics hydrophilic.  The free hydroxyl groups on one side of the polymer compositions can be used as sites for functionalization for further surface modifications.  The R group can be polar or neutral and can range in size from a simple alcohol to a complex carbohydrate  residue.    When  the  R  group  1s  a carbohydrate, the polymer compositions tend to form stable gels in aqueous solution to form the polymer composition that 1s a two-dimensional polymer.,<br>
When the R group 1s derived from an amino acid with a neutral or anionic side chain or 1s an alkyl phosphate, sulfonate, or phosphate, the polymer compositions are anionic. Anionic polymer compositions are prepared according to the method of the present invention by heating one equivalent of furanone with the appropriate amino acid in water or water/ethanol in the presence of sufficient base to deprotonate the amino<br><br>
group to form the polymer composition that 1s an anionic polymer.<br>
When the R group 1s a polyamine such as pentaethylene hexamine, the polymer compositions are cross-linked cationic elastomers- Cross-linked cationic elastomer polymer compositions are prepared according to the method of the present invention by heating one or 0.5 equivalents of furanone with the appropriate polyamine in ethanol to form the polymer composition that 1s a cross-linked elastomer.<br>
When the R group 1s a mixture of a long chain aliphatic primary amines and polyamines, the polymer composition 1s soluble in an organic solvent but can complex metal ions and anions. The metal binding polymer composition allows solubilization of metal ions such as copper 1I, gold 1, silver 1, nickel 1, and 1ron 1I and 1II in solvents such as chloroform or toluene.<br>
The present invention has established the general conditions for adding amines to 2 (5)-furanone to yield polyamides. The mechanism for the reaction 1s shown in Figure 2. Reaction of 2 (5)-furanone with a long chain primary amine yields polyamides with structures similar to that shown in Figure lA. The molecular weight of the polyamides can be controlled by adjusting the temperature and time for which the amine and 2(5)-furanone are reacted. By dissolving the polymer in a non-polar solvent such as ether and floating the ether solution on water while allowing the ether to evaporate, a polymer sheet 1s formed (Figure 3) which has been shown by polarized light microscopy to be highly oriented (Figure 4). The present invention also allows the properties of the polymer compositions to be altered by controlling the degree of polymerization (average molecular weight), the length of the hydrocarbon chain (R group),  the degree  the hydrocarbon  chain 1s<br><br>
unsaturated, and combinations thereof.<br>
The polymers of the present invention are completely new materials in the art of polymer chemistry. The polymers are two-dimensional sheets having a hydrophobic face and a hydrophilic face which have uses such as modifying the properties of the surfaces of plastics to increase wettability or biocompatibility/ or waterproofing hydrophilic surfaces. Polymers that can waterproof of hydrophilic surfaces 1s an 1mportant application for the present invention. For example/ paper 1s the dominant material for the fabrication of disposable plates and cups and other similar products and for wrapping. Treatment of paper products with certain polymers of the present invention that will make them non-wettable would reduce reliance on the use of non-degradable plastics. The ability to control the surface properties of diverse materials with the polymers of the present invention 1s an 1mportant advance in material and surface science. For example, by using polyunsaturated alkyl groups as the side chain (R group) , a continuous two-dimensional sheet of n-systems are made, making 1t possible to fabricate planar materials with a conducting or optically active n-band for use in electronic devices such as carbon-based microchips or display devices.<br>
Hydrogels can be made according to the present invention by synthesizing polyamides with structures as shown in Figure 1D which when the pH 1s adjusted to a low value, the polyamides become highly charged and readily form stable hydrogels which can hold many tens of times their weight of water. The properties of the hydrogels made according to the present invention can be<br>
controlled by adjusting the pH, the ionic strength of<br>
»<br>
the solution, and the number of amino acids per side chain•<br><br>
Hydrogels are an 1mportant material with a wide variety of uses which include artificial tissue(Refojo and Leong (1981), J. Biomed. Mater. Res., vol. 15, pp. 497-509), surgical 1mplants (Corkhill et al.    (1990). Proc. inst. Mech. Eng., vol. 204, pp. 147-155), contact lens materials (Corkhill et al. (1989) . Biomaterials, vol. 10, pp. 3-10; Bruck (1973). J. Biomed. Mater. Res., vol. 7, pp. 387-404), grafting of foreign materials to tissue (Salter and Kell (1991). Curr. Opin. Biotechnol., vol. 2, pp. 385-389), simple drug delivery vehicles (Kim et al. (1992). Pharm. Res., vol. 9, pp. 283-290), smart drug delivery vehicles that respond to temperature or pH (Vakkalanka et ai. (1996). J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed., vol. 8, pp. 119-129; Yoshida et ai. (1991). J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed., vol. 3, pp. 155-162; DeMoor et al. (1991). Biomaterials, vol. 12, pp. 836-840), enzyme 1mmobilization   matrices    for   biotechnological applications (Valuev et al. (1993) . J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed., vol. 5, pp. 37-48), in vascular grafts (Zdrahala (1996). J. Biomater. Appl., vol. 10, pp. 309-329),  in composites (Cauich-Rodriguez et al.  (1996) . Biomaterials,  vol.  17,  pp.  2259-2264),  and  as mechanical-electrical  substances Osada and Matsuda (1995) . Nature, vol. 376, pp. 219).   Hydrogels are primarily polymeric compositions that can retain a very high proportion of water. A basic structural feature of hydrogels 1s that the polymer backbone 1s hydrophilic and often charged.  The hydrophiliclty ensures good solvation and the charged groups cause the framework to expand because of repulsion of like charge.  Presently, synthesis of hydrogels usually involve vinyl alcohol (Mongia et ai. (1996). J. Biomater. Sci., vol. 7, pp. 1055-1064; Peppas and Merrill (1977). J. Biomed. Mater. Res., vol. 11, pp. 423-434), hydroxymethyl acrylate (Jeyanthi and Kao (1990)., Biomaterials, vol. 11, pp.<br><br>
238-243; Hoffmann (1975) . in: Polymers in Medicine and Surgery. Kronenthal (ed). Plenum Press, New York, NY./ pp, 33-44), or carbohydrates (Lotina et al. (1996). Biomaterials, vol. 17, pp. 559-569; Patil et al. (1996). Biomaterials, vol. 17, pp. 2343-2350) as the starting monomers'. Both vinyl alcohol and hydroxymethyl acrylate are petroleum-based materials. in many synthesizing reactions carbohydrates are grafted onto the polymer backbone.<br>
Metal recovery from contaminated waste sites, industrial effluents, and spent consumer products 1s one of the most difficult problems faced by environmental engineers.  A system that could bind metals and extract them from aqueous environments 1s a much desired need. The polymers of the present invention solve the need by providing polymers that are soluble in water and which bind metals  in the water producing polymer-metal complexes which then can be extracted into an organic solvent.  Specifically, the aforementioned polymers are compositions that are balanced between long hydrocarbon chains and polyamino chains.  The hydrocarbon chains pack together to form a two-dimensional lamellar system with the polar polyamino groups on the polar face. Such polymers can bind many transition elements which allows the elements to be extracted into organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, ether or ethyl acetate with very higl\ efficiency.  Examples of metals that can be bound by the polymers are copper 1I, gold 1, silver 1, nickel 1 and 1ron 1I and 1II.  The polymers of the present invention when complexed with a metal such as copper and gold and in an organic solvent can be deposited, painted or printed onto circuit boards or microchips to connect various elements. The solvent evaporates leaving behind the metal which can conduct electrical currents. Therefore, the polymers can be used to make conductive<br><br>
tracks on an insulating surface which 1s highly desirable for microelectronics fabrication such as microchips and circuit boards. Atomic force microscopy demonstrates that the film surface made by the polymers of the present invention 1s extremely flat, much flatter than can typically be attained by the leading edge technologies of chemical vapor deposition or sputter coating. Chemical vapor deposition and sputter coating require high vacuums, very high temperatures and/or the formation of very reactive species.<br>
The polymers of the present invention represent a ma j or step forward  in coating technologies and in preparing planar materials. The polymers of the present invention can be used in the manufacture of marine paints containing metals such as copper. Copper 1s toxic to the growth of microorganisms and 1s a desired component of marine paints (Llewellyn (1972). Ann. Occup. Hyg./ vol. 15, pp. 393-397). However, marine paints are oil-based and the forms of copper that are soluble in organic solvents in high proportions are difficult to manufacture. Therefore in many marine paints, copper metal 1s used because soluble forms of copper are not available. Toluene 1s a common paint solvent and the polymers of the present invention comprising toluene-soluble copper solutions have much promise in manufacture of marine paints especially since the polymers form layers thus increasing the surface availability of the metal. . Copper surfaces lead to less fouling than do plastic surfaces in studies involving potable water (Rogers et al. (1994). Appl. Environ. Microbiol., vol. 60, pp. 1585-1592).<br>
The area of water recovery 1s another area that can benefit from the polymers of the present invention. Polycationic materials such as chitosan are used as flocculants for removal of metal ions, bacteria, and<br><br>
viruses from water (Steinmann and Havemeister (1982) . Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. B., vol • 17 6, pp.546-552). The polymers of the present invention can be used for precious metal and radioactive metal recovery (Onsoyen and Skaugrud (1990). J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol., vol. 49, pp. 395-404; Muzzarelli and Rocchetti (1974). J. Chromatogr., vol. 96, pp. 115-121), toluene-soluble metal complexes will allow the extraction of transition metal ions into organic solvents.<br>

EXAMPLE 26<br>
Two-dimefisional polymer compositions of the present invention having a hydrophobic face on one side and a polar poly-cationic face on the other were used to coat materials such as Teflon and polypropylene which were then tested to determine whether said coated materials were thrombogenic and therefore not useful for medical applications such as contact with blood. Applications anticipated are use of the two-dimensional polymers for the preparation of non-thrombogenic surfaces for applications where blood would come in contact with a foreign surface (e.g., an 1mplant or catheter) which would present risk of clotting or coagulation. Results from a Federal Drug Administration (FDA) laboratory approved laboratory using standard FDA-approved protocols showed that materials coated with two-dimensional polymer compositions of the present invention are non-thrombogenic and, in addition, did not result in lysis of red blood cells•<br>
A two-dimensional polymer prepared from n-octylamine, tetradecylamine, pentaethylamine hexamine and 2 (5H)-furanone which had a hydrophobic face on one side and a polar polycationic face on the other was used to coat materials such that the hydrophobic face was adsorbed to the material. The process of coating the material consisted of soaking 1t in a trough containing the polymer in an ethyl, alcohol and water solution. The polycationic face was then hydrated to form a hydrogel and an interpenetrating gel-layer of Na-heparin was then formed upon the polymer. Figure 6 is a schematic diagram showing the alkyl chains of the two-dimensional polymer adsorbed to the hydrophobic face of the material (basement substrate) and the polar heads of the polymer forming a hydrogel comprising the anionic heparin gel,  interpenetrating gel matrix,  and the<br><br>
cationic gel.<br>
The following test was performed to quantitate the thrombogenic potential of materials coated with the two-dimensional polymer of the present invention. The test was a standard recalcification procedure which consisted of measurement of the clotting time of plasma in contact with the material after addition of excess calcium.<br>
The procedure consisted of drawing blood using vacutainers containing 0.1 M sodium citrate at a ratio of 9:1 (blood to anticoagulant).  The blood was stored refrigerated until used in the testing which was within  four hours of being drawn.  Handling of the drawn blood was  in compliance with  the Department  of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Occupation Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens, Final Rule Standard, 29 CFR Part 1910.1030.   The samples were prepared by 1mmersing 1.8 cm2 sample in plasma.  The amount of test material tested was based on USP surface area recommendations or by weight (4.0 g/20 ml extract fluid for polymers and plastic, 2.0 g/20 ml extract fluid for elastomers. Each sample was tested six times. The test reagents were equilibrated at 37°C for sixty minutes.  Samples were prepared in 10 x 75 mm plastic tubes. Plasma (0.2 ml) and sterile saline (0.2 ml) were added to each sample and control tubes.  Samples and control tubes were equilibrated exactly ten minutes. Calcium chloride (0.2 ml) was then added to each test and °Control tube, gently mixed and held at 37°C until the sample clotted.  The tubes were inspected by gentle tilting every five seconds.  The positive control tube contained plasma and sterile saline and glass beads of approximately the same surface area as the tested sample,  and  the negative  control  tube  contained polypropylene beads of approximately the same surface area as the tested sample.  The control and sample tubes<br><br>
were run through the test concurrently.<br>
The average clotting time and standard deviation for the controls are summarized in Table 1, however statistical analysis was not performed using analysis of variance, because the first test sample consisting of polypropylene coated with the present invention did not clot after an average of 1,620 seconds and the second test sample consisting of Teflon coated with the present invention did not clot after an average of 1,645 seconds. in contrast the negative control sample/ which consisted of uncoated polyproylene, clotted in 352 averaged seconds and the positive control which consisted of uncoated glass, clotted in 237 averaged seconds. The results show that materials coated in the polymers of the present invention did not demonstrate a shortened clotting time and therefore pose no thrombogenic risk. Moreover, for each test sample the clotting time was lengthened.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 27<br>
Two-dimensional polymer compositions of the present invention having a hydrophobic face on one side and a polar poly-cationic face were used to coat materials which were then tested to determine whether said coated materials had hemolytic activity and therefore not useful for applications which required contact with blood.<br>
Applications anticipated are use of the two-dimensional polymers for the preparation of nonhemolytic surfaces for applications where blood would come in contact with a foreign surface (e.g., an 1mplant or catheter). Results from a Federal Drug Administration (FDA) laboratory approved laboratory using standard FDA-approved protocols showed that materials coated with two-dimensional polymer compositions of the present invention are less hemolytic than current materials.<br>
A two-dimensional polymer with a hydrophobic face on one side and a polar polycationic face on the other prepared from n-octylamine, n-tetradecylamine, pentaethylamine tetramine and 2 {5H)-furanone was used to coat material TEFLON® and polypropylene such that the hydrophobic face was adsorbed to the material by soaking the substrate in a trough containing the polymer in an ethyl, alcohol and water solution. The polycationic face was then hydrated to form a hydrogel and an interpenetrating gel-layer of Na-heparin was then'formed upon the polymer.<br>
The following was performed to quantitate the hemolytic potential of materials coated with the two-dimensional polymer of the present invention. The test was a standard procedure which consisted of measuring the percent hemolysis of serum in contact with materials coated with said compositions.<br><br>
The procedure consisted of drawing blood using vacutainers containing 3.8% sodiuia citrate. The drawn blood was stored refrigerated until used in the testing. Handling of the blood was in compliance with the Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Occupation Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens, Final Rule Standard, 29 CFR Part 1910.1030. The samples were prepared by 1mmersing 1.8 cm2 sample in plasma. The amount of test material tested was based on USP surface area recommendations or by weight (4.0 g/20 ml extract fluid for polymers and plastic, 2.0 g/20 ml extract fluid for elastomers. Each sample was tested three times. To each test tube 14.7 cm2 of sample and 4.9 ml of the physiological saline was added. Then 0.16 ml of blood was added to each tube. The tubes were gently mixed, then incubated at 37°C for one hour. A hemolytic positive control consisting of 0.1% Na2C03 in sterile water and a non-hemolytic negative control consisting of uncoated polypropylene beads were included in the test. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 500 x g and the optical density (OD) of the supernatant fluid was read at 540 nm in a spectrophotometer. The percent hemolysis was interpreted using the following equation:<br>
Percent Hemolysis = T - N/P - N x 100<br>
Where T is the test sample OD, N is the negative control OD, and P is the positive control OD.<br>
The results summarized in Table 2 for two experiments show that materials coated with the two-dimensional polymer compositions of the present invention were non-hemolytic. Significantly, both samples coated with the present invention were found to be less hemolytic than the negative control.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 28<br>
This example is a method for metallizing plastic, glass/  or  other  non-metallic  surfaces.    A  two dimensional polymer with hydrocarbon chains on one face and metal ion chelating groups (to which ions are bound) on the other face was prepared from n-octylamine, tetradecylamine,  2 (5H) -furanone  and  pentaethylene hexamine.  The polymer was layered (hydrophobic side down) onto the non-metallic surface.  The ions are then reduced with a suitable reductant to the free metal which remains as a film on the surface.<br>
Figure 7 represents a two-dimensional polymer with the alkyl chains adsorbed to a hydrophobic substrate (basement membrane) and complexed to metal ions which are then reduced to the metal. A copper 1I solution in toluene was prepared and a dried film of a chloroform solution of the polymer was prepared from n-octylamine, tetradecylamine, 2 (5H) -furanone and pentaethylene hexamine on the bottom of an Erlenmeyer flask. The solutions when painted onto a glass surface form very even films which are conductive which can be reduced to thin films of copper metal by reacting with dilute borohydride solutions. The metal inhibits biofilm formation.<br>
