Coating Compositions Containing Levelling Agents Prepared by Nitroxvl Mediated Polymerisation<br>
The present invention relates to costing compositions containing a polymeric or copolymeric levelling agent, which has been prepared by nitroxyl - med iated polymerisation. Further aspects are a process for the preparation of smooth surface coatings and the use of said polymer or copolymer as levelling agent in coating compositions. Yet another aspect are specific ethylenically unsaturated monomer compositions from which copolymers can be obtained by atom transfer radical polymerisation or nitroxyl mediated polymerisation, which copolymers are useful as levelling agents in coating compositions. Still another aspect is the use of poly-tert.-butyl acrylate or poly-tert-butyl methacrylate as a levelling agent in powder coating compositions.<br>
In the context of the present invention it is understood that the term coating compositions defines organic coating compositions.<br>
Smooth and crater free surfaces are required for almost all coating applications, because they provide not only an aesthetic but also a protective function. In case that the coating is not homogenous and some parts of the surface are not, or only very thinly coated a poor protection results. In order to achieve a smooth surface, levelling agents are added to all sorts of coatings. Suitable levelling agents are, for example, polymers or copolymers derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as acrylates or methacrylates. In the case of -liquid coating formulations a large number of levelling agents is known and commercially available. As long as the viscosity of the coating formulation is low, a sufficient levelling can be obtained with these conventional levelling agents. Increasing problems are observed when the viscosity increases, such as is the case for high solids coatings or particularly for powder coatings. Especially in the case of thermally or radiation curable powder coatings there is a strong demand for additives improving the levelling of the coating.<br>
Attempts have therefore been made to improve the action of levelling agents in thermosetting coatings by controlling the polymer architecture. For example US 6,197,883 discloses thermosetting coating compositions containing a levelling agent, which has been polymerised using atom transfer radical polymerisation techniques (ATRP).<br><br>
WO 03/027155 further describes thermosetting coating compositions containing a copolymer levelling agent with siloxane or perfluoralkyl moieties, prepared by an ATRP process.<br>
However, there is still a need for improved levelling agents, which offer a different and improved balance of properties, e.g. with respect to levelling performance, yellowing tendency and handling characteristics. Thus an optimised control of the polymer architecture appears to be the key for improvement.<br>
The present invention relates to a coating composition containing a levelling agent, which has been synthesized by nitroxyl mediated free radical polymerization (NO. and NOR). Linear, branched, tapered and graft structures can be obtained with a variety of monomers, depending on the functionality and reactivity of the nitroxylether or nitroxyl radical used. This type of controlled free radical polymerisation allows the synthesis of polymers or copolymers with well-defined molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions. By adjusting the molecular weight, liquid or solid (co)polymers can be obtained.<br>
In particular, for powder coatings a solid levelling agent is of great advantage. Usually liquid levelling agents have to be formulated into a solid product form by preparing a master batch in the respective powder coating, adsorbing it onto silica or applying another solid carrier. This leads to an increase in production costs as well as stock keeping. As the compounds are no longer 100 % active a higher amount has to be added to the coating formulation. A solid active material alleviates the problem of stock keeping of different master batches and allows the addition of lower amounts to the formulation. With the instant invention powder coatings can be formulated containing for example a homo- or copolymerisate of various acrylate/methacrylate monomers with narrow molecular weight distribution and a glass transition temperature Tg or melting temperature Tm higher than 30 Â°C so that the materials can be handled as solid compounds without the need for further formulation.<br>
For many coating applications, such as for example clear coats or white solid shades, none or only a slight yellowish aspect is tolerable. Surprisingly it has been found that the levelling agents of the instant invention lead to a significantly reduced yellowing of the coatings, as compared to prior art levelling agents.<br>
One aspect of the invention is a coating composition comprising<br><br>
a1) a physically drying film forming binder resin or resins;<br>
a2) a thermally cross linking film forming binder resin or binder resins;<br>
a3) a radiation curable film forming binder resin or binder resins;<br>

provided that the amount of unsubstituted acrylic acid (C1-C22)alkyl esters or/and methacrylic<br>
acid (C1-C22)alkyl esters is more than 30 % by weight based on the weight of the total<br>
monomer mixture;<br>
E  is a group bearing at least one stable free nitroxyl radical, which is bound via the<br>
oxygen atom to the polymer or copolymer; or a group which results from a substitution or<br>

y is a number 1 or greater than 1 indicating the average number of end groups E<br>
attached to the monomer sequence (M)x; n is a number from 1 to 20; and<br>
c)	optionally water or/and one or more organic solvents.<br>
The (C1-C22)alky! groups may be linear or branched. Examples of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, 2-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, 2-pentyl, hexyl, heptyl,<br><br>
octyl, 2-ethyIhexyl, t-octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl and eicosyl. C1-C16alkyl is preferred.<br>
Film forming physically drying binder resins mentioned under a1) are typically derived from a,Î²-unsaturates 'acids and derivatives thereof such as polyacrylates and polymethacrylates, polymethyl methacrylates, polyacrylamides and polyacrylonitriles. Examples are thermoplastic polyacrylates (TPA).<br>
Another class is for example derived from natural polymers such as cellulose acetate or butyrate. Also suitable are physically drying alkyd resins or nitrocellulose lacquers.<br>
Thermally cross linking film forming binder resins mentioned under a2) are for example those given below.<br>
1.	Crosslinked polymers derived from aldehydes on the one hand and phenols, ureas and<br>
2.	melamines on the other hand, such as phenol/formaldehyde resins, urea/formaldehyde re<br>
3.	sins and melamine/formaldehyde resins.<br>
4.	Drying and non-drying alkyd resins.<br><br>
3.	Unsaturated polyester resins derived from copolyesters of saturated and unsaturated<br>
4.	dicarboxylic acids with polyhydric alcohols and vinyl compounds as crosslinking agents, and<br>
5.	also halogen-containing modifications thereof of low flammability.<br>
6.	Crosslinkable acrylic resins derived from substituted acrylates, for example epoxy acrylates, urethane acrylates or polyester acrylates. These resins are typically crosslinked with<br>
7.	melamine resins or (poly)isocyanate resins and known as thermosetting acrylics.<br>
8.	Alkyd resins, polyester resins and acrylate resins crosslinked with melamine resins, urea<br>
9.	resins, isocyanates, isocyanurates, polyisocyanates or epoxy resins.<br>
10.	Crosslinked epoxy resins derived from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic<br>
11.	glycidyl compounds, e.g. products of diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and bisphenol F, which<br><br>
are crosslinked with customary hardeners such as anhydrides or amines, with or without accelerators.<br>
The cross linking alkyd resins which can be used as film forming binder resins in the present invention are the conventional stoving lacquers which are used in particular for coating automobiles (automobile finishing lacquers), for example lacquers based on alkyd/melamine resins and alkyd/acrylic/melamine resins (see H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx. "Lackkunstharze" (1977). pages 99-123). Other crosslinking agents include glycouril resins, blocked isocyanates or epoxy resins.<br>
The coating compositions may be applied on wood, metal or plastic substrates.<br>
The instant coating compositions are particularly suitable both for metal finish coatings and solid shade finishes of automobiles, especially in the case of retouching finishes, as well as various coil coating applications. The coating compositions in accordance with the invention are preferably applied in the conventional manner by two methods, either by the single-coat method or by the two-coat method. In the latter method, a pigment-containing base coat is applied first and then a covering coat of clear lacquer over it.<br>
When water-soluble, water miscible or water dispersible coatings are desired ammonium salts of acid groups present in the resin are formed. Powder coating composition can be prepared by reacting glycidyl methacrylate with selected alcohol components, as will be outlined hereinafter.<br>
The leveling agents, component b) are particularly useful when no organic solvent or water is present in the coating composition. This is typically the case for powder coatings.<br>
Powder coating is a known technology and is described, for example, in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Fifth. Completely Revised Edition, Volume A 18". pages 438 to 444 (1991). In the powder coating process, a powder is generally fluidized with supply of air, electrostatically charged and applied to an earthed, preferably metallic substrate. The substrate is subsequently heated, in the course of which the adhering powder melts, coalesces and forms a coherent film on the metal surface. Since powder coating requires no solvent, this technology is especially friendly to the environment.<br><br>
By powder coatings there are meant thermoplastic or stovable, crosslinkable polymers which are applied in powder form to predominantly metallic substrates. The manner in which the powder is brought into contact with the workpiece to be coated characterizes the various application techniques, for example electrostatic powder spraying with corona or triboelectric pistols, electrostatic fluidized-bed sintering or by using magnetic brush technology.<br>
Preferred organic film-forming binders for the powder coating compositions according to the present invention are stoving systems based on, for example, epoxy resins, polyester-hydroxyalkylamides, polyester-glycolurils, epoxy-polyester resins, polyester-triglycidyl isocyanurates, hydroxy-functional polyester-blocked polyisocyanates, hydroxy-functional polyester-uretdiones, acrylate resins with hardener or mixtures of such resins. Also of interest are film-forming binders having thermoplastic properties, for example polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamides, polyvinyl chlorides, polyvinylidene dichloride or polyvinylidene difluoride.<br>
Polyesters are generally hydroxy- or carboxy-functional and are usually prepared by condensation of diols and dicarboxylic acids. The addition of polyols and/or polyacids produces branched polyesters which then, on stoving in the presence of crosslinkers, give rise to network structures which impart to the coating the desired physical properties, such as scratch resistance, impact strength and flexural strength. Instead of multifunctional acids it is also possible to use anhydrides or acid chlorides, for example maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, terephthalic anhydride, hexahydroterephthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride or succinic anhydride. It is also possible to use simple esters, for example dimethyl terephthalate, polymerization proceeding by transesterification with elimination of the volatile alcohol. Likewise practicable is preparation by a combination of transesterification and condensation. Furthermore, polyesters can be prepared by polycondensation of hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example 12-hydroxystearic acid and hydroxypivalic acid, or the corresponding lactones, for example e-caprolactone. Examples of dicarboxylic acids and polyacids include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, 1,12-dodecanedioic acid, pyromellitic acid, 3,6-dichlorophthalic acid, succinic acid, 1,3-cycIohexanedicarboxylic acid and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. Examples of diols and polyols include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, hexanetriol, hexane-2,5-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, neopentylglycol, trimethylolethane, trlmethylolpropane, tris-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, trimethylpentanediol, 2,2-diethyl-1,3-<br><br>
propanediol, 2-methyl-2-butyl-1,3-propanediol, Esterdiol 204 (ester of hydroxypivalic acid and neopentylglycol), hydrogenated bisphenol A, bisphenol A, hydroxypivalic acid, hydroxypivaiate esters, 2-butyl-2-ethyl,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 2-butene-1,4-diol, 2-butyne-1,4-diol or 2-methyI-1,3-propanediol.<br>
Suitable crosslinking agents for carboxy-functional polyesters are epoxy compounds, for example NovolacÂ®-epoxy resins, diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A, hydrogenated bisphenol A and bisphenol A modified by reaction with, for example, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. Also suitable are reactive epoxy compounds, such as triglycidyltriazolidine-3,5-dione, the glycidyl esters of polyacids, for example diglycidyl terephthalate and diglycidyl hexahydroterephtha-late, hydantoin epoxides (US-A-4 402 983) and, very particularly, triglycidyl isocyanurate and aliphatic polyepoxy compounds such as, for example, AralditÂ® PT910 (formerly Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and also epoxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid esters such as, for example, UranoxÂ® (DSM). Other crosslinking agents for carboxy-functional polyesters are |3-hydroxyalkylamides (see US-A-4 076 917), for example the primarily tetrafunctional P-hydroxyalkylamide derivative of adipic acid (PrimidÂ® XL552 and PrimidÂ® QM 1260 from Rohm &amp; Haas). Derivatives of melamine, benzoguanimine and glycoluril which are alkylated with low molecular mass alcohols have also been found to be suitable. Examples are tetramethylmethoxyglycoluril (PowderlinkÂ® 1174 from American Cyanamid). Other known crosslinking agents are bis- and trisoxazolidines, for example 1,4-bisoxazolidinobenzene.<br>
Recent substances are carboxy-functional polyesters which include chemically bonded epoxy groups and as a consequence are able to crosslink with themselves (Molhoek et al., 22nd Fatipec Congress, 15.-19.5.95, Budapest, Vol.1,119-132).<br>
In all systems in which an epoxy group or a glycidyl radical reacts with a carboxyl group or with an anhydride in a crosslinking reaction, catalysts can be employed. Examples are amines or metal compounds, for example aluminium acetylacetonate or tin octoate.<br>
As crosslinking agents for hydroxy-functional polyesters the polyisocyanate crosslinkers are of particular importance. In order to prevent premature crosslinking owing to the high reactivity of isocyanates and in order to obtain good levelling of the melted powder, the polyiso-cyanates are blocked (internally as a uretdione or as an adduct with a blocking agent). Blocking agents most frequently employed are caprolactam, methyl ethyl ketoxime or<br><br>
butanone oxime. Other suitable blocking agents for isocyanates are described in the publications by G.B. Guise, G.N. Freeland and G.C, Smith, J. Applied Polymer Science, 23, 353 (1979) and of M. Bock and H.-U. Maier-Westhues in "Progress in Product Development for Powder Coating Technology, XlXth Int. Conf. on Organic Coatings, Science and Technol., Athens, 12-16 July", 1993. Examples of blocked and unblocked polyrsocyanates include 2-methylpentane 1,5-diisocyanate, 2-ethylbutane 1,4-diisocyanate, 3(4)-isocyanatomethyl-1-methylcyclohexyl isocyanate, 3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexane diisocyanate, tris(isocyanatomethyl)benzene, 4,4-diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane, 1,4-bis(isocya-natomethyl)cyclohexane, m-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate, p-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate and, in particular, isophorone diisocyanate. For reaction of the unblocked diisocyante it is common to add a metallic catalyst, for example tin octoate, dibutyltin oxide or dibutyltin dilaurate, to the polyisocyanate formulation.<br>
Further suitable crosslinking agents for hydroxy-functional polyesters are anhydrides, for example trimellitic anhydride and its reaction products with diols and diamines. Further examples of such crosslinking agents are described by T.A. Misev in "Powder Coatings: Chemistry and Technology", J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester on pages 123 and 124.<br>
Polyacrylates, which commonly have hydroxyl, carboxyl or glycidyl functionality, are also employed as binders for powder coatings. They are prepared by the customary methods, principally from monomers such as, for example, styrene and linear or branched C1-C8alkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Other ethylenically unsaturated compounds, for example divinylbenzene, acrylamide, methacrylamide, butoxymethylacrylamide, acrylonitrile or butadiene can also be added and copolymerized. Hydroxyl functionality is ensured by the copolymerization of hydroxy-functional monomers, for example hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate. For carboxyl functionality, ethylenically unsaturated acids and anhydrides are used, for example acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, acrylic anhydride or methacrylic anhydride (US-A-3 836 604). Glycidyl functionality is given, as taught in EP-A-0 256 369 and US-A-3 876 578, by the copolymerization of monomers such as glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate. As crosslinking agents for polyacrylates with hydroxyl or carboxyl functionality it is possible in principle to use the same compounds as already described for the polyesters with hydroxyl or carboxyl functionality. Further suitable crosslinking agents are the epoxy compounds of US-A 0 045 040. Suitable crosslinking<br><br>
agents for polyacrylates with glycidyl functionality are dicarboxylic acids, for example sebacic acid, 1,12-dodecanedicarboxylic acids, and anhydrides, for example bistrimellitic anhydride, and the compounds described in US-A-3 880 946. Furthermore, autocrosslinking polyacrylates from DE-A-3 310 545 are also known.<br>
Epoxy resins for powder coatings are mostly either NovolacÂ®-epoxy resins or, in particular, those based on aromatic polyols, especially those based on bisphenol such as bisphenol A. Also known are modified bisphenol-epoxy resins, from JP-A-58 187 464 (1982). The epoxy resins are employed in combination with crosslinkers from the classes of the solid aliphatic amines, solid aromatic amines, amine adducts, phenolic resins, polyacids and the carboxy-functional polyesters already described. Very particular mention as hardeners is to be made of the dicyandiamides, which are frequently employed together with a catalyst such as Lewis acids, boron trifluoride-amine complexes, metal complexes, tertiary or quaternary amines, and imidazoline derivatives, such as 2-methylimidazoline.<br>
In the powder coating compositions according to the present invention the resin and the crosslinking agent are employed judiciously in approximately stoichiometric amounts. Deviation from the stoichiometric amounts by more than 30 % leads in most cases to a decrease in the desired physical properties of the cured coating film, for example flexibility, impact strength, adhesion, weathering resistance or solvent resistance.<br>
Preferred powder coating compositions include, as further additives, one or more components from the group of the pigments, dyes, fillers, waxes, levelling assistants, degassing agents, charge control agents, optical brighteners, adhesion promoters, antioxidants, light stabilizers, curing catalysts or photoinitiators. The powder coating compositions may also include corrosion inhibitors, for example anticorrosion pigments, such as phosphate- or borate-containing pigments or metal oxide pigments, or other organic or inorganic corrosion inhibitors, for example salts of nitroisophthalic acid, phosphoric esters, technical-grade amines or substituted benzotriazoles.<br>
Suitable photoinitiators for radiation curable powder coating compositions, which are cured, for example, with UV light are those based on benzophenones, phenylglyoxalates, bis-and/or mono-acylphosphine oxides, a-hydroxy ketones or benzil dimethyl ketals. As light<br><br>
sources it is judicious to employ medium-pressure or high-pressure mercury lamps. A more detailed description of radiation curable coating composition is given below.<br>
Examples of degassing agents are fatty acid amides as described in EP-A-0 471 409, e-caprolactam, methyl isophthalate and dimethyl isophthalate (EP-A-284 996) and, very particularly, benzoin.<br>
Examples of conventional levelling assistants are epoxidized fatty acids, abietyl alcohol, polylauryl methacrylate, polylauryl acrylate, polydimethylsiloxane-polyalkylene oxide block copolymers or, in particular, polymers and copolymers of low molecular weight of Ci-C8alkyl acrylate esters or alkyl methacrylate esters.<br>
Adhesion promoters are based, for example, on modified silanes, titanates or zirconates. An example of an optical brightener is UvitexÂ®OB (Ciba Specialty Chemicals).<br>
The pigments are, for example, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, carbon black, aluminium bronze, phthalocyanine blue or aminoanthraquinone.<br>
Examples of fillers are talc, alumina, aluminium silicate, aluminium phosphate, barytes, mica, lithopone, silica, calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, zinc carbonate, zinc phosphate or mixtures thereof.<br>
Radiation curable film forming binder resins mentioned under a3) are, besides the afore mentioned powder coatings, typically ethylenically unsaturated monomers or oligomers examples are given below.<br>
The unsaturated compounds of the radiation-curable composition may contain one or more ethylenically unsaturated double bonds. They may be lower molecular weight (monomeric) or higher molecular weight (oligomeric). Examples of monomers having a double bond are hydroxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates, e.g. 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate. Further examples are, acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-substituted (meth)acrylamides and acrylic or methacrylic acid.<br><br>
Examples of monomers having more than one double bond are propylene glycol diacrylate, dipropylene glycol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, hexa-methylene glycol diacrylate pentaerythritol triacrylate, tris(hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate triacrylate (SartomerÂ® 368; from Cray Valley).<br>
It is also possible in radiation-curable systems to use acrylic esters of alkoxylated polyols, for example glycerol ethoxylate diacrylate, glycerol propoxylate diacrylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate triacrylate, pentaerythritol propoxylate tetraacrylate, neopentyl glycol ethoxylate diacrylate or neopentyl glycol propoxylate diacrylate. The degree of alkoxylation of the polyols used may vary.<br>
Examples of higher molecular weight (oligomeric) polyunsaturated compounds having additionally polar groups, such as -OH, -COOH or NH2 are acrylated epoxy resins, acrylated or vinyl-ether- or epoxy-group-containing polyesters, polyurethanes and polyethers. Further examples of unsaturated oligomers are unsaturated polyester resins, which are usually produced from maleic acid, phthalic add and one or more diols and have molecular weights of from 500 to 3000. In addition it is also possible to use vinyl ether monomers and oligomers, and also maleate-terminated oligomers having polyester, polyurethane, polyether, polyvinyl ether and epoxide main chains. In particular, combinations of vinyl-ether-group-carrying oligomers and polymers, as described in WO 90/01512, are very suitable, but copolymers of monomers functionalised with maleic acid and vinyl ether also come into consideration. Such unsaturated oligomers can also be termed prepolymers.<br>

Photoinitiators suitable for use in the process according to the invention are in principle any compounds and mixtures that form one or more free radicals when irradiated with electromagnetic waves. These include initiator systems consisting of a plurality of initiators and systems that function independently of one another or synergistically. In addition to coinitiators, for example amines, thiols, borates, enolates, phosphines, carboxylates and imidazoles, it is also possible to use sensitisers, for example acridines. xanthenes, thiazenes, coumarins, thioxanthones, triazines and dyes. A description of such compounds and initiator systems can be found e.g. in Crivello J.V., Dietliker K.K.. (1999): Chemistry &amp; Technology of UV &amp; EB Formulation for Coatings, Inks &amp; Paints, and in Bradley G. (ed.) Vol. 3: Photo-initiators for Free Radical and Cationic Polymerisation 2nd Edition. John Wiley &amp; Son Ltd. The photoinitiator suitable for the process according to the invention in step b) may be either an initiator having an unsaturated group or an initiator not having such a group Such compounds and derivatives are derived, for example, from the following classes of compounds: benzoins, benzil ketals, acetophenones. hydroxyalkylphenones, aminoalkyl-phenones, acylphosphine oxides, acylphosphine sulfides, acyloxyiminoketones, alkylamino-substituted ketones, such as Michler's ketone, peroxy compounds, dinitrile compounds, halogenated acetophenones, phenylglyoxylates, dimeric phenylglyoxalates, benzophenones, oximes and oxime esters, thioxanthones. coumarins, ferrocenes, titanocenes, onium salts,<br><br>
sulfonium salts, iodonium salts, diazonium salts, borates, triazines, bisimidazoles, poly-silanes and dyes. It is also possible to use combinations of the compounds from the mentioned classes of compounds with one another and combinations with corresponding coinitiator systems and/or sensitisers.<br>
Typical examples of individual photoinitiators are mentioned below, which can be used either singly or in admixture with one another. For example, benzophenones, benzophenone derivatives, acetophenone, acetophenone derivatives, for example a-hydroxy-cycloalkylphenyl ketone or 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propanone, dialkoxyacetophenones, a-hydroxy- or a-amino-acetophenones, for example (4-methylthiobenzoyl)-1 -methyl-1 -morpholino-ethane, (4-morphoIino-benzoyI)-1-benzyl-1-dimethylamino-propane, (4-methyl-thiobenzoyl)-1 -methyl-1 -morpholino-ethane, (4-morphoIino-benzoyl)-1 -(4-methyl-benzyI)-1 -dimethylamino-propane, 4-aroyl-1,3-dioxoIanes, benzoin alkyl ethers and benzil ketals, e.g. benzil dimethyl ketal, phenylglyoxalates and derivatives thereof, dimeric phenylglyoxalates, monoacylphosphine oxides, for example (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyI-phosphine oxide, bisacylphosphine oxides, for example bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-(2)4,4-trimethyl-pent-1- -yl)phosphine oxide, bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl-phosphine oxide or bis(2,4,6-trimethyIbenzoyl)-(2,4-dipentyloxyphenyl)phosphine oxide, trisacylphosphine oxides, ferrocenium compounds or titanocenes, for example dicyclopentadienyI-bis(2,6-difluoro-3-pyrrolo-phenyl)-titanium and borate salts.<br>
As coinitiators there come into consideration, for example, sensitisers which shift or broaden the spectral sensitivity and thus bring about an acceleration of the photopolymerisation. They are especially aromatic carbonyl compounds, for example benzophenone, thioxanthone, especially isopropyl thioxanthone, anthraquinone and 3-acylcoumarin derivatives, terphenyls, styryl ketones, and also 3-(aroyImethylene)-thiazolines, camphor quinone, and also eosine, rhodamine and erythrosine dyes.<br>

As mentioned above it is mandatory that the polymer or copolymer levelling agent of formula (I), component b), is prepared by nitroxyl mediated controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP). Solomon et al. in US 4,581,429 have firstly described such processes.<br>
U.S. 4,581,429 discloses a free radical polymerization process by controlled or "living" growth of polymer chains, which produces defined oligomeric homopolymers and copoly-mers, including block and graft copolymers. Disclosed is the use of initiators of the partial formula R'R"N-O-X. In the polymerization process the free radical species R'R"N-O and â¢X are generated. *X is a free radical group, e.g. a tert.-butyl or cyanoisopropyl radical, capable of polymerizing monomer units containing ethylene groups.<br>
A variation of the above process is disclosed in US 5 322 912 wherein the combined use of a free radical initiator and a stable free radical agent of the basic structure R'R"N-O for the synthesis of homopolymers and block copolymers is described.<br>
These processes are useful for the preparation of homo-, random-, block-, tapered-, graft-or comb (co)polymers, which have a narrow molecular weight distribution and hence a low polydispersity index.<br>
As already mentioned it is indispensable that the (c)opolymers are obtained by nitroxyl<br>
mediated controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP). There are essentially two suitable<br>
routes:<br>
b1) polymerization in the presence of alkoxyamine initiator/regulator compounds having the<br><br><br>
b2) polymerization in the presence of a stable nitroxyl free radical having the structural<br><br>
ring system or substituted to form a acyclic structure.<br>
Suitable nitroxylethers and nitroxyl radicals are principally known from US-A-4 581 429 or EP-A-621 878. Particularly useful are the open chain compounds described in WO 98/13392, WO 99/03894 and WO 00/07981, the piperidine derivatives described in WO 99/67298 and GB 2335190 or the heterocyclic compounds described in GB 2342649 and WO 96/24620. Further suitable nitroxylethers and nitroxyl radicals are described in WO 02/4805 and in WO 02/100831.<br>
Nitroxylethers and nitroxyl radicals with more than one nitroxyl group in the molecule are for example described in US 6,573,347, WO 01/02345 and WO 03/004471. These compounds are ideally suitable when branched, star or comb (co)polymers are prepared. In this case y and/or n in formula (I) above are greater than 1.<br>
In the context of the present invention the terms alkoxyamine and nitroxylether are used as equivalents.<br><br><br><br>

The group E must not necessarily be a stable free nitroxyl radical, which is bound via the oxygen atom to the polymer or copolymer. It is also possible that it is a group, which results from a substitution or elimination reaction of the attached stable free nitroxyl radical.<br>
For the introduction of another group at the chain end or to render the nitroxyl-terminated polymer non-reactive, several possibilities exist to remove or exchange the nitroxide (NO*). Some specific examples are given below.<br>
The nitroxide chain end can e.g. be exchanged by the use of compounds that can generate radicals upon homolytic cleavage e.g. tetraphenylethane based products. Exchange of the nitroxide chain end is carried out by heating the polymer in the presence of e.g. a tetraphenyl ethane derivative up to a temperature were the equilibrium between the open and closed chain end is active. Exchange of the nitroxide and the homolytically cleaved tetraphenyl ethane derivative takes place. This is for example desC1-ibed by Beyou, E.; Jarroux, N.; Zydowicz, N.; Chaumont, P. MaC1-omol. Chern. Phys. 2001, 202, 974-79 (Functional End-Group Exchange of Nitroxide- or Bromo-Terminated Polystyrene)<br>
The nitroxide chain end can also be removed by the use of Zn/acetic acid under the formation of an OH-group at the chain end. This is desC1-ibed by Chessa, G.; SC1-ivanti, A.; Matteoli, U.; Castelvetro, V. Polymer 2001, 42, 9347-53 (Synthesis of three- and six-arms polystyrene via living/controlled free radical polymerisation)<br><br>
A further possibility is the use of unsaturated compounds, which cannot be readily homo-polymerised via radical polymerisation. Examples are monomers like maleic anhydride, maleimide, n-substituted maleimides, maleic acid esters, fumaric acid esters, Î± -methylstyrene, dialkylfumarates, or non-activated alkenes like isobutene, cyclohexene, 1-octene or isomers, alkylallylethers, allylesters. Such unsaturated compounds are preferentially added to the NOMerminated polymer after consumption and/or removal of the monomers, which are reactive in nitroxyl-mediated polymerization. The NOMerminated polymer and the non-polymerisation reactive unsaturated compound are than heated to elevated temperatures e.g. 100-150Â°C for a time period sufficient to render the polymer inactive towards further chain growth. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed, that by such a post-treatment with non-reactive monomers, all or most of the NO*-groups are split off from the polymer and one or only a few units of the non-reactive unsaturated compound are inserted at the polymer chain end. Specific examples for such a post-treatment functionalization is the reaction with maleic anhydride and malemides under the formation of a double bond as desC1-ibed by Harth, E.; Hawker, C.J.; Fan, W.; Waymouth, R.M. MaC1-omolecules 2001, 34(12), 3856-62 (Chain End Functionalization in Nitroxide-Mediated "Living" Free Radical Polymerizations)<br>
Yet another possibility is the use of compounds that can induce a fragmentation at the chainend e.g. by using methaC1-ylates in nitroxide mediated free radical polymerisation. The nitroxide chain end of an aC1-ylic polymer can be removed by heating with e.g. an excess of methyl methaC1-ylate at a temperature were the equilibrium of the open and closed chain end is active. Formation of a double bond at the chain end and the removal of the nitroxide can be observed, as desC1-ibed by Cheng, C; Yang, N.-L Polymer Preprints 2003, 41(1), 1010-11 C. Burguiere, M.-A. Dourges, B. Charleux, J.-P. Vairon, MaC1-omolecules, 1999, 32, 3883-3890.<br>
A simple method for elimination of NO* from the polymer made by nitroxide mediated controlled free radical polymerisation is by heating to high temperatures after removal of the reactive monomer. This leads to a polymer, which is inactive for further nitroxyl-mediated polymerisation. Without being bound to theories, it is believed that by such thermal post-treatment the NO* groups eliminates or is exchanged from the polymer.<br><br>

Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is, for example, desC1-ibed in WO 96/30421. WO 96/30421 discloses a controlled or "living" polymerization process of ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene or (meth)aC1-ylates by employing the ATRP method. According to this method initiators are employed which generate a radical atom such as â¢Cl, in the presence of a redox system of transition metals of different oxidation states, e.g. Cu(l) and Cu(II), providing "living" or controlled radical polymerization.<br><br><br>
transferable atom or group âHal as is desC1-ibed in WO 96/30421 and WO 98/01480. A preferred radically transferable atom or group â¢Hal is âCI or â¢Br, which is cleaved as a radical from the initiator molecule.<br>

Specific initiators are selected from the group consisting of Î±,Î±'-dichloro- or Î±,Î±'-dibromoxy-lene, p-toluenesulfonylchloride (PTS), hexakis-(Î±-chloro- or Î±-bromomethyl)-benzene, 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionic acid, 2-chloro- or 2-bromoisobutyric acid, 1-phenethyl chloride or bromide, methyl or ethyl 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionate, ethyl-2-bromo- or ethyl-2-chlor-oisobutyrate, chloro- or bromoacetonitrile, 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionitrile, Î±-bromo-benz-acetonitrile and Î±-bromo-Î³-butyrolactone (= 2-bromo-dihydro-2(3H)-furanone). The transition metal in the oxidizable transition metal complex catalyst salt used in the process of the invention is present as an oxidizable complex ion in the lower oxidation state of a redox system. Preferred examples of such redox systems are selected from the group consisting of Group V(B), VI(B), VII(B), VIII, IB and IIB elements, such as Cu7Cu2+, CuÂ°/Cu+ FeÂ°/Fe2, Fe27Fe3+, Ru2+/Ru*.

The ionic charges are counterbalanced by anionic ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals, such hydride ions (H"~) or anions derived from inorganic or organic acids, examples being halides, e.g. F~, CF, Br~ or F, fluoro complexes of the type BF4~, PF6~, SbF6~ or AsF6~, anions of oxygen acids, alcoholates or acetylides or anions of cyclopentadiene.<br><br>
Anions of oxygen acids are, for example, sulfate, phosphate, perchlorate, perbromate, periodate, antimonate, arsenate, nitrate, carbonate, the anion of a Ci-C8carboxylic acid, such as formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, benzoate, phenylacetate, mono-, di- or trichloro- or -fluoroacetate, sulfonates, for example methylsulfonate, ethylsulfonate, propylsulfonate, butylsulfonate, trifluoromethylsulfonate (triflate), unsubstituted or C1-C4alkyl-, C1-C4alkoxy- or halo-, especially fluoro-, chloro- or bromo-substituted phenylsulfonate or benzylsulfonate, for example tosylate, mesylate, brosylate, p-methoxy- or p-ethoxyphenylsulfonate, pentafluorophenylsulfonate or 2,4,6-triisopropylsulfonate, phosphonates, for example methylphosphonate, ethylphosphonate, propylphosphonate, butylphosphonate, phenylphos-phonate, p-methylphenylphosphonate or benzylphosphonate, carboxylates derived from a C1-C8carboxylic acid, for example formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate, benzoate, phenylacetate, mono-, di- or trichloro- or -fluoroacetate, and also C1-C12-alcoholates, such as straight chain or branched Ci-Ci2-aIcoholates, e.g. methanolate or ethanolate. Anionic ligands and neutral may also be present up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation, especially four, five or six. Additional negative charges are counterbalanced by cations, especially monovalent cations such as Na, K+, NH4+ or (C1-C4 alkyl)4N+.<br>
Suitable neutral ligands are inorganic or organic neutral ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals. They coordinate to the metal ion through a Î±-, Ï-, Ï-Î·-type bonding or any combinations thereof up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation. Suitable inorganic ligands are selected from the group consisting of aquo (H2O), amino, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and nitrosyl. Suitable organic ligands are selected from the group consisting of phosphines, e.g. (C6H5)3P, (i-C3H7)3P, (C5H9)3P or (C6Hn)3P, di-, tri-, tetrÎ±- and hydroxyamines, such as ethylenediamine, ethylenediaminotetraacetate (EDTA), N,N-Dimethyl-Nl,N'-bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl)Â»ethylenediamine (Me6TREN), catechol, N,N'-dimethyl-1,2-benzenediamine, 2-(methylamino)phenol, 3-(methylamino)-2-butanol or N,N'-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine, N,N,Nl'N",N"-pentamethyldiethy-triamine (PMD-ETA), C1-C8-glycols or glycerides, e.g. ethylene or propylene glycol or derivatives thereof, e.g. di-, tri- or tetraglyme, and monodentate or bidentate heterocyclic e- donor ligands.<br>

The oxidizable transition metal complex catalyst can be formed in a separate preliminary reaction step from its ligands or is preferably formed in-situ from its transition metal salt, e.g. Cu(l)CI, which is then converted to the complex compound by addition of compounds corresponding to the ligands present in the complex catalyst, e.g. by addition of ethylenediamine, EDTA, Me6TREN or PMDETA.<br>
Preferably the oxidizable transition metal in the transition metal complex salt is present as a transition metal complex ion in the lower oxidation state of a redox system.<br>
More preferably the transition metal complex ion is a Cu(l) complex ion in the Cu(l)/Cu(ll) system.<br><br>
for example present in an amount of 1:10 to 1:100, relative to the monomers. The total amount of oxidizable transition metal to initiator of formula (III) is for example from 0.05:1 to 2:1, in particular from 0.2:1 to 0.5:1. All ratios are weight ratios.<br>

The chlorine or bromine atom bound to the polymer end when ATRP technique is used may<br>
be removed and/or substituted by functional groups, such as -ON(R)(R) groups, NH2, -<br>
N(R)(R), OH or -O-C(O)-C1-=CH2. Examples for such substitutions are given in WO<br>
01/51534, WO 00/18807, WO 93/43719 or WO 98/40415.<br>

d)	Benzoin from Fluka AG<br>
e)	Modaflow P 3 from UCB Surface Specialties, USA commercial levelling agent.<br>
The components are mixed using a planetary stirrer. The mixture is then extruded on a prism extruder at 300 revolutions/minute at 110Â°C and is rolled out. The powder coating composition is coarsely comminuted using a bench cutter and is ground in a Retsch ZM-1 ultracentrifugal mill with a 0.75 mm annular-perforation sC1-een at 15,000 revolutions/minute. Finally, the powder is passed through a 125Î¼m sieve on a centrifugal sieving machine having an average particle size of from 30 to 50 p,m.<br>
The finished powder coating composition is sprayed electrostatically to a coat thickness of 70 to 80 Î¼m onto aluminium panels using an ESB-Wagner corona cup gun at 60 kV. The coated panels are cured in an electric oven at 180Â° C for 10 minutes.<br>
The following parameters are determined:<br>
1)	yellowness: b* ISO 7724 (ASTM D 2244). Large values of b* denote strong<br>
2)	yellowing.<br>
3)	gloss @ 20Â° measured with a BYK Gardner haze-gloss in accordance with the<br>
4)	manufacturer's suggested method of operation. High gloss values indicate high reflectance<br>
5)	of the coating films.<br><br>
3)	DOI (distinctness of reflected image) with a BYK Gardner wave-scan DOI in<br>
accordance with the manufacturer's suggested method of operation. While a DOI value at<br>
zero is for a perfect diffusion, a DOI value of 100 means a perfect mirror image indicating a<br>
very smooth surface.<br>
4)	Longwave with a BYK Gardner wave-scan DOI  in accordance with the<br>
manufacturer's suggested method of operation. Longwave values of lesser magnitude are<br>
indicative for coatings that are smoother in appearance.<br><br>
