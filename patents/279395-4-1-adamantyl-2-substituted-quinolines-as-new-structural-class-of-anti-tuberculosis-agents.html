(l-adamantyl)-2-substituted quinolines as new structural class of anti-tuberculosis agents. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention deals with biological activities of 4-(l-adamantyl)-2-substituted quinolines. More preferably, as new structural class of anti-tuberculosis agents of general formula (i), which offer an improved and additional means for the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein R represents side-chain present in all D/L amino acids, R1 represents -H, CH3; C2H5; C3H7; NHNH2; CO2C(CH3)3; CO2CH2C6H5; CO2CH3; CO2C2H5; CO3C2H7. The development of these compounds offers and adds one more line of drugs for the treatment and control of disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Development of resistance to known drugs is a growing phenomenon and now has reached alarming levels for certain infectious diseases. Tuberculosis (TB) has staged a deadly comeback primarily because of resistance development by the causative organism, Mycobacterium tuberculosis against all major anti-TB drugs, and the rising incidence of immuno-compromised situations partly due to cancer chemotherapy, AIDS infection and transplantation. Approximately, 32% of the world's population is currently infected with TB. Each year, eight to nine million of infected people develop clinical pulmonary TB, leading to more than 2 million deaths around world. If this trend continues, TB is likely to claim more than 35 million lives within the next decade.<br>
Although regimens exist for treating tuberculosis, they are far from ideal. Treatment usually involves a combination of first line of TB drugs — Isoniazid (INH) and Rifampicin (RIF), which are given for at least 6 months, and pyrazinamide and ethambutol (or streptomycin),<br>
which are used only in the first 2 months of treatment. This complex and long treatment regimen was rarely followed strictly and patients usually stop taking medicine once common symptoms of TB disappear. To make this regimen workable a program of Directly Observed Treatment, Short course (DOTS) is recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). Statistics suggest that currently one-fourth of the world's TB patients were treated under DOTS. Inconsistent or partial treatment leads to the development and spread of drug-resistant strains. These strains have a much lower cure rate and can be up to 100-fold more expensive to treat. There is thus an urgent need for shorter, simpler therapeutic and prophylactic regimens to increase patient compliance. In addition, new drugs are needed to combat the increasing number of multi-drug-resistant strains (MDR-TB). Treatment for MDR-TB often requires the use of a second line of TB drugs, all of which can produce serious side effects. Therapy for 18 months to 2 years may be necessary, and patients should receive at least three drugs to which the bacteria are susceptible. The survival rate for patients with MDR-TB is approximately 50 percent. The inadequate armory of drugs in widespread use for the treatment, and development of drug-resistant forms of the disease against most commonly used mainstay drugs INH and RIF have severely curtailed fight against TB. Despite this it has been nearly forty years since a new structural class of drug was introduced specifically to treat this infectious disease. This underscores the continuing urgent need for the discovery of new structural classes of anti-tuberculosis agents to replace and/or to supplement the current drug regimens.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to develop a new compound which is effective against tuberculosis.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to identify simple process for the production of anti-tuberculosis agent [4-(l-adamantyl)-2-substituted quinolines].<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is about a compound of 4-(1-adamantyl)-2-substituted quinolines derivatives for the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis comprising general formula (i)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein 'X" is selected from formula (ii) or (iii) (Formula Removed)<br>
<br>
wherein, R represents side-chain present in all D and L amino acids, R1 represents -H, H3; C2H5; C3H7; NHNH2; CO2C(CH3)3; CO2CH2C6H5; CO2CH3; CO2C2H5; CO3C2H7.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides 4-(l-adamantyl)-2-substituted quinolines derivatives of general formula (I) for the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis. Some of these new derivatives have shown excellent in vitro anti-tuberculosis activity against M tuberculosis H37Rv strain. All these compounds are structurally different from so far existing anti-tuberculosis drugs; thus making it attractive for further development. It is expected that development of these compounds as ideal anti-tuberculosis agents will add to already existing armament for the suppression as well as radical cure of the tuberculosis infection.<br>
4-(Adamantan-l-yl)-quinoline-2-carboxylic acid (4) was synthesized in three steps from commercially available quinoline-2-carboxylic acid (1). The latter compound 4 upon reaction with thionyl chloride in the presence of pyridine for one minute produced acid chloride derivative in situ, which upon subsequent reaction with commercially available suitably side-chain protected L/D-amino acid methyl esters in the presence of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) in Dichloromethane (DCM) provided methyl esters 5-12 in good yields (Scheme 1).<br>
The methyl esters 5-12 upon reaction with hydrazine hydrate in presence of abs. ethanol for 48 h at ambient temperature produced 4-(adamantyl-l-yl)- quinoline-2-carboxylic acid (1-hydrazinocarbonylalkyl) amides 13-17. For some compounds (where side chain is protected i.e. Orn, Lys with carbobenzyloxy and Tyr with benzyl) an additional deprotection step was performed. The deprotection at the side-chain was achieved by reaction with 33% HBr in acetic acid at ambient temperature for 30 min to produce 4-(adamantyl-l-yl)-quinoline-2-<br>
carboxylic acid (l-hydrazinocarbonyl-alkyl)amides 18-20 as their hydrobromide salts in .xcellent yields (Scheme 1). (Formula Removed)<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
4-(Adamantan-l-yl)-quinoline-2-carbohydrazide (21) required for the synthesis of 22-31 was synthesized in three convenient steps from commercially available quinoline-2-carboxylic acid (1). The latter compound 21 upon reaction with suitably side-chain protected commercially available Boc/Cbz-L/D-amino acids in the presence of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and DMAP in anhydrous DCM as solvent for 8 h afforded Boc/Cbz-group protected quinoline-amino acid conjugates (5)-{l-[Ar'-(4-adamantan-l-yl-quinoline-2-carbonyl)-hydrazinecarbonyl]alkyl carbamic acid tert-butyl esters 22-31 (Scheme 2).<br>
The latter compounds 22-31 upon reaction with 33% hydrogen bromide solution in acetic acid at ambient temperature for 30 min easily and cleanly produced 4-(adamantan-l-yl)quinoline-2-carboxylic N'-(2-aminoalkyl)hydrazides 32-40 as hydrobromide salt (Scheme 2).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme2. (i) NH2NH2.H20, EtOH, 80 °C, 8 h; (ii) DCC, DMAP, Boc-AA-OH, 8h, DCM; (iii) 33% HBr-AcOH, 30 min, rtor HCI-MeOH, 8h, rt,<br>
Advantageously, this compound may be formulated so as to prepare tablets, pellets, pills or capsule, for which the binders are selected from glycol, ethyl cellulose, starch paste, poly vinyl pyrrolidone. Lubricants are selected from vegetable oils, stearic acid, Magnesium stearate, Aluminium Stearate. Glidant is selected from Colloidal silicon dioxide, cab-o-sil, talc and Disintegrant is selected from crossed linked poly vinyl pyrrolidone, cross carmilose, sodium starch glycolate.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES<br>
In vitro activity of the 4-(l-adamantyl)-2-substituted quinolines for tuberculosis inhibition against M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain (ATCC 27294, susceptible both to rifampicin and isoniazid) was initially carried out using the Microplate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA). As a result a concentration of 6.25 µg/mL is finalized as standard dose.<br>
Compounds exhibiting fluorescence at the standard concentration (6.25 µg/mL) were then tested in the BACTEC 460 radiometric system for activities expressed as Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC, µg/mL). The obtained results are summarized in Tables 1-2.<br>
Compounds demonstrating &gt;90% inhibition at a concentration of 6.25 µg/mL in the initial screen were then retested to determine the actual MIC value that is defined as the lowest concentration exhibiting &gt;90% inhibition.<br>
Synthetic modifications of 4-l-adamantyl-quinoline-2-carboxilic acid is done by coupling it with various D/L-amino acids was achieved (I). For modification, the selection of the amino acid was carried out in such a way so as to determine the effect of the following;<br>
1.	Hydrophobicity -by incorporating alanine (Ala), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (lieu)<br>
2.	Hydrophilicity - by incorporating tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), lysine (Lys) and<br>
3.	Unnatural amino acid ornithine (Orn).<br>
In general, all ester derivatives of the amino acid conjugates were found more effective than their hydrazide counterparts; with ala analogue 13 being the sole aberration. Analogue 13 displayed 82% inhibition at the test concentration of 6.25 ug/mL; whereas, its methyl ester counterpart 5 only produced 73% inhibition at same test concentration. The most effective compound from the series was the methionine analogue 8 (Rt = CH3), which produced 86% inhibition at MIC of 6.25 ug/mL. Interestingly, conversion of the methyl ester of methionine analogue 8 to corresponding hydrazide derivative 16 (R1 = NHNH2) resulted in marked reduction in the biological activity (68% inhibition, MIC = 6.25 µg/mL).<br>
In case of leu amino acid, both ester and hydarzide analogues 7 and 15 exhibited 83% inhibition at the test concentration of 6.25µg/mL. Cationic amino acid derivatives 18 and 19 displayed 48% and 36% inhibition respectively at 6.25 ug/mL (Table 1).<br>
Table 1. In vitro antimycobacterial activity evaluation of methyl 2-[4-(l-adamantyl)-2-quinonylcarboxamido]alkanoate and N2-[ 1 -hydrazino-carbonylalkyl]-4-( 1 -adamantyl)-2-quinoline-carboxamides 5-20 derivatives against drug-sensitive M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain. <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The most effective tryptophan-quinoline conjugated analogue 26 [Ri = COiCXCHs^] of the series (II) exhibited 95% inhibition at the preliminary test concentration of 6.25 p.g/mL. Similarly, histidine-ring-substituted quinoline conjugated analogue 23 [Ri = CO2C(CH3)3] displayed promising 92% inhibition at the preliminary test concentration of 6.25 jug/mL (Table 2).<br>
Table 2. In vitro antimycobacterial activity evaluation of (S)-{ l-[N'-(4-Adamantan-l-yl-quinoline-2-carbonyl)hydrazinocarbonyl]alkyl carbamic acid tot-butyl esters and (S)-4-adamantan-l-yl-quinoline-2-carboxylic acid.N-(2-aminoalkyl)hydrazides 22-40 derivatives against drug-sensitive M. tuberculosis H3 7Rv strain.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
At the same time, hydrophobic side chain containing amino acid conjugates have shown moderate antimycobacterial activity with inhibition in the range of 42-88% at the concentration 6.25 µg/mL. Of these analogues, the most effective was the ala-quinoline conjugated analogue 28 [Ri = CO2C(CH3)3] which displayed 88% inhibition at the test concentration of 6.25 µg/mL. To our surprise, when the t-Boc protection of the amino group in 28 was removed, resulting compound 38 displayed marked reduction in the antimycobacteraial activity. A general observation of the already acquired results in this series predicts that heteroaromatic side-chain containing amino acid conjugates of 4-(l-<br>
adamantyl)-2-substitutedquinolines are better anti-tuberculosis agents compared to their non-heteroaromatic side-chain containing counterparts.<br>
