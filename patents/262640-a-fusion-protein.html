				<td>VACCINE<br>
The present invention relates to fusion proteins comprising an antigen derived from<br>
the so-called tumour rejection antigen PRAME (also known as DAGE) linked to an<br>
immunological fusion partner which provides T helper epitopes, such as, for example<br>
protein D from Haemophilus influenzae B, methods for preparing the same and for<br>
formulating vaccines and use of the same for treating a range of cancers, including, but not<br>
limited to melanoma, breast, bladder, lung cancer such as NSCLC, sarcoma, ovarian<br>
cancer, head and neck cancer, renal cancer, colorectal carcinoma, multiple myeloma,<br>
leukemia including acute leukemia and oesophageal carcinoma.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to fusion partner proteins<br>
comprising protein D derivatives and methods for preparing same.<br>
Among different groups of tumour-associated antigens, cancer testis antigens are of<br>
interest for immunotherapy because of their broad tumour-specific expression and the fact<br>
that generally these antigens are not expressed in healthy cells. More than 50 cancer/testis<br>
antigens have been described so far and, for many of them, epitopes recognized by T<br>
lymphocytes have been identified. PRAME is a cancer testis antigen and is in under<br>
investigation as a potential immunotherapy.<br>
In immunotherapy the cancer antigen is introduced to the patient usually as a vaccine,<br>
for example containing an antigen as a protein or an immunogenic fragment thereof, or as<br>
DNA encoding for the protein or as a vector containing said DNA, which stimulates the<br>
patient's immune system to attack tumours expressing the same antigen.<br>
If the appropriate response is stimulated, T lymphocytes (T cells) attack antigens<br>
directly, and provide control of the immune response. B cells and T cells develop that are<br>
specific for one antigen type. When the immune system is exposed to a different antigen,<br>
different B cells and T cells are formed. As lymphocytes develop, they normally learn to<br>
recognize the body's own tissues (self) as different from tissues and particles not normally<br>
found in the body (non-self). Once B cells and T cells are formed, a few of those cells will<br><br>
multiply and provide "memory" for the immune system. This allows the immune system to<br>
respond faster and more efficiently the next time it is exposed to the same antigen.<br>
Certain experiments seem to indicate that cancer testis antigens can stimulate the memory<br>
mechanisms in the immune system.<br>
It is hypothesized by some that PR..AME is involved in cell death or cell cycles. It<br>
has been shown by some groups to be expressed in melanoma and a wide variety of<br>
tumours including lung, kidney and head and neck. Interestingly it also seems to be<br>
expressed in 40-60% leukemia such as acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid<br>
leukemia, see for example Exp Hematol. 2000 Dec;28(l2):1413-22. In patients it has been<br>
observed that over expression of PRAMH seems to be associated with higher survival and<br>
lower rates of relapse in comparison to those who do not over express the protein.<br>
The antigen and its preparation are cescribed in US patent No. 5, 830, 753.<br>
PRAME is found in the Annotated Human Gene Database H-Inv DB under the accession<br>
numbers: U65011.1, BC022008.1, AK129783.1, BC014974.2, CR608334.1, AF025440.1,<br>

CR456549.1, and CR620272.1.<br>
Protein D is a surface protein of the gram-negative bacterium, Haemophilus<br>
influenza B. Information on immunological fusion partners derived from protein D can be<br>
obtained from WO 91/18926.<br>
Fusion proteins of a. portion of an antigen and a heterologous fusion partner are<br>
sometimes prepared to increase the immunogenicity of the antigen and/or aid production<br>
of the protein in appropriate quantities and/or purity see for example WO 99/40188 which<br>
describes a fusion protein of MAGE and, for example protein D a surface protein of the<br>
gram-negative bacterium, Haemophilus influenza B. The fusion protein is prepared<br>
recombinantly and the protein D secretion sequence can be incorporated into the fusion<br>
protein to potentially assist secretion and solubilisation of the final product.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a fusion protein comprising:<br>
a)	FRAME or an immurtogenic fragment thereof, and<br>
b)	a heterologous fusion partner derived from protein D,<br>
wherein the said fusion protein does not include the secretion sequence (signal sequence)<br>
of protein D.<br>
The present invention further provides a fusion partner protein as described herein<br>
derived from protein D, in which the fusion partner protein does not include the secretion<br>
sequence or signal sequence of protein D.<br>
The present invention further provices a fusion protein as described herein and an<br>
antigen or fragment thereof.<br>
The present invention further provides a fusion partner protein derived from protein<br>
D, in which the fusion partner protein comprises or consists of amino acids 20 to 127 of<br>
protein D. In one embodiment of the present invention, one or more amino acids from the<br>
protein D fusion partner protein as described herein may be deleted or may be replaced by<br>
substitution. The amino acids may be substituted with conservative substitutions as<br>
defined herein, or other amino acids may be used. In one embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,<br>
9 or more amino acids may be substituted.<br>
The protein D fusion partner protein as described herein may additionally or<br>
alternatively contain deletions or insertions within the amino acid sequence when<br>
compared to the wild-type protein D sequence. In one embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9<br>
or more amino acids may be inserted or deleted.<br>
The term "secretion sequence" or "signal sequence" or "secretion signal" of protein<br>
D, in the context of this application, is intended to refer to approximately amino acids 1 to<br><br>
16,	17, 18 or 19 of the naturally occurring protein.  In one embodiment, the secretion or<br>
signal sequence or secretion signal of protein D refers to the N-terminal 19 amino acids of<br>
protein D.  The terms "secretion sequence" or '"signal sequence" or "secretion signal" are<br>
used interchangeably in the present specification.<br>
The fusion partner protein of the present invention may comprise the remaining full<br>
length protein D protein, or may comprise approximately the remaining N-terminal third of<br>
protein D. For example, the remaining N-terminal third of protein D may comprise<br>
approximately or about amino acids 20 to 127 of protein D. In one embodiment, the<br>
protein D sequence for use in the present invention comprises amino acids 20 to 127 of<br>
protein D. In a further embodiment, the present invention comprises or consists of any of<br>
the sequences starting from any of the following amino acids of the protein D sequence:<br>
17,	18, 19, 20, 21, or 22; and terminating at any on the following amino acids of the<br>
protein D sequence: 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138,<br>
139 or 140.<br>
By "remaining" in this context is neant the sequence of the protein D protein<br>
without the secretion or signal sequence as described herein.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention in which the fusion protein comprises<br>
PRAME or an immunogenic fragment thereof, the protein D derivative of the present<br>
invention comprises approximately the first 1/3 of the protein, more specifically the amino<br>
acids 20 to 127. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which the fusion<br>
protein comprises PRAME or an immunogenic fragment thereof, the protein D comprises<br>
approximately the first 1/3 of the protein in which the N-terminal 109 amino acids of<br>
protein D are used. In one embodiment of the present invention the protein D portion does<br>
not include the secretion sequence of the protein. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention the protein D derivative is not lip) dated.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a protein D construct, as<br>
described herein, as a fusion partner protein. The protein D construct may be a fusion<br>
partner protein for a construct additionally comprising a PRAME or MAGE-A3 construct<br><br>
as described herein or may be a fusion partner protein for a construct additionally<br>
comprising another cancer antigen or any other antigen.<br>
It seems that for fusion proteins comprising PRAME or an immunogenic fragment<br>
thereof and protein D, or for fusion proteins comprising protein D, or for a fusion partner<br>
protein comprising protein D, that the presence of the secretion sequence (or signal<br>
sequence) may detrimentally affect the amount of fusion protein produced.<br>
PRAME<br>
In one aspect the fusion protein of the present invention comprises a fusion partner protein<br>
as described herein and a PRAME antigen or immunogenic fragment thereof. Generally<br>
the PRAME protein has 509 amino acids and in one embodiment all 509 amino acids of<br>
PRAME may be used. Several cytotoxic T lymphocytle (CTL) epitopes have been<br>
identified on PRAME, for example:<br>
VLDGLDVLL (PRA10(M08; SEQ ID NO: 1.3);<br>
SLYSFPEPEA (PRA142"15i; SEQ ID NO:! 4);<br>
ALYVDSLFFL (PRA3O<wo9 seq ed no:15></wo9>
LYVDSLFFL (PRA301309; SEQ ID NO: 16) and<br>
SLLQHLIGL (PRA425^33; SEQ ID NO: 17)<br>
Generally it is desirable to include as many of these epitopes as possible into the<br>
antigen to generate a strong immune response and ensure the antigen is as immunogenic as<br>
possible. Although, it may be possible to compensate for a lower immunogenicity of a<br>
given construct by employing a formulation with a potent immunological adjuvant. Strong<br>
adjuvants are discussed below in more detail.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides the PRAME portion of the fusion protein<br>
comprising, consisting of or consisting essentially of full length protein.<br>
However, the invention also extends to PRAME constructs with conservative<br>
substitutions. In one embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more amino acids may be<br>
substituted. The PRAME construct as described herein may additionally or alternatively<br>
contain deletions or insertions within the amino acid sequence when compared to the wild-<br><br>
type PRAME sequence.  In one embodiment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more amino acids<br>
may be inserted or deleted.<br>
Conservative substitutions are well known and are generally set up as the default<br>
scoring matrices in sequence alignment computer programs. These programs include<br>
PAM250 (Dayhoft M.O. et al, (1978), "A model of evolutionary changes in proteins1', In<br>
"Atlas of Protein sequence and structure" 5(3) M.O. Dayhoft (ed.), 345-352), National<br>
Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, and Blosum 62 (Steven Henikoft and Jorja<br>
G. Henikoft (1992), "Amino acid substitution matricies from protein blocks"), Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 89 (Biochemistry): 10915-10919.<br>
In general terms, substitution within the following groups are conservative substitutions,<br>
but substitutions between groups are considered non-conserved. The groups are:<br>
i)       Aspartate/asparagine/glutamate/gluta mine<br>
ii)      Serine/threonine<br>
iii)    Lysine/arginine<br>
iv)     Phenylalanine/tyrosine/tryptophane<br>
v)      Leucine/isoleucine/valine/methionine<br>
vi)    Glycine/alanine<br>
Generally the PRAME sequence/amino acids used in the fusion proteins of the<br>
invention will be greater than 80%, such as 85, 90, 95 and more specifically 99% identical<br>
to naturally occurring PRAME. However, those skilled in the art are aware that amino<br>
acid residues generated as a result of the cloning process may be retained in the<br>
recombinantly synthesized proteins. If thes;e do not detrimentally affect the characteristics<br>
of the product, it is optional whether or not they are removed.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides a fusion protein as described herein comprising,<br>
consisting of or consisting essentially of full length PRAME protein. In a further aspect<br>
the PRAME portion of the fusion protein of the present invention comprises, consists of or<br>
consists essentially of one or more of the following epitopes:<br>
VLDGLDVLL (PRAl0(M08; SEQ ID NO: 12);<br><br>
SLYSFPEPEA (PRAM2~151; SEQ ID NO:14);<br>
ALYVDSLFFL (PRA3OO~309; SEQ ID NO:1 5);<br>
LYVDSLFFL (PRA301"309; SEQ ID NO: 161 and<br>
SLLQHLIGL (PRA425"433; SEQ ED NO: 17).<br>

to direct an immune response to the antigen. Li one embodiment, the Her-2/neu antigen<br>
may be one of the following fusion proteins which are described in WO00/44899.<br>
The antigen for use in the present invention may comprise or consist of "HER-2/neu ECD-<br>
ICD fusion protein," also referred to as "ECD-ICD" or "ECD-ICD fusion protein," which<br>
refers to a fusion protein (or fragments thereof) comprising the extracellular domain (or<br><br>
fragments thereof) and the intracellular domain (or fragments thereof) of the HER-2/neu<br>
protein. In one embodiment, this ECD-ICD fusion protein does not include a substantial<br>
portion of the HER-2/neu transmembrane domain, or does not include any of the HER-<br>
2/neu transmembrane domain.<br>
In a further embodiment, the antigen may comprise or consist of "HER-2/neu ECD-PD<br>
fusion protein," also referred to as "ECD-PD" or "ECD-PD fusion protein," or the "HER-<br>

does not include any of the HER-2/neu trarsmembrane domain.<br>
The fusion proteins of the PRAME antigen and protein D fusion partner protein as<br>
described herein may be chemically conjugated, but are preferably expressed as<br>
recombinant fusion proteins, which may allow increased levels of PRAME protein to be<br>
produced in an expression system as compared to PRAME alone without fusion partner,<br>
such as protein D or modified protein D proteins.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the tumour antigens described herein and the fusion<br>
partner protein of the present invention may be chemically conjugated or may be<br>
expressed as recombinant fusion proteins, which may allow increased levels of PRAME<br>
protein or another tumour antigen to be produced in an expression system as compared to<br>
PRAME or another tumour antigen alone without fusion partner, such as protein D or<br>
modified protein D proteins.<br>
Fusion proteins of the present invention, as described herein, may additionally comprise<br>
one or more linker sequences between the fusion partner protein and the tumour antigen or<br>
immunogenic portion thereof; or between the fusion partner protein and a His tail or other<br>
affinity tag (if present); or between the tumour antigen or immunogenic portion thereof and<br>
a His tail or other affinity tag(if present). The amino acids in the linker sequences may be<br>
unrelated to the sequences of the antigen and/or fusion partner.<br><br>
Fusion proteins of the present invention, as described herein, may additionally comprise<br>
amino acids Met-Asp-Pro at the N-termina! end of the fusion protein sequence. The Met<br>
amino acid may be from the original protein D sequence or may be from an unrelated<br>
sequence.<br>
The fusion partner may assist in expressing the protein (expression enhancer) at<br>
higher yields than the native recombinant protein. The fusion partner protein D, due to its<br>
foreign nature, maybe particularly immune genie in vivo and assist the fusion protein<br>
comprising PRAME or another tumour antigen by providing T helper epitopes, preferably<br>
T helper epitopes recognised by CD4 T-cells. Such CD4-T cells may be believed to<br>
contribute to generating a favourable immune response, in particular, a CD8 cytolytic T-<br>
cell response.<br>
In one embodiment, the fusion partner may act as both an expression enhancing partner<br>
and an immunological fusion partner.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides a fusion protein wherein the N-terminal portion<br>
of protein D (as described above or herein) is fused to the N-terminus of PRAME or an<br>
immunogenic fragment thereof. More specifically the fusion with the protein D fragment<br>
and the N-terminus of PRAME is effected such that the PRAME replaces the C-terminal-<br>
fragment of protein D that has been excised. Thus the N-terminus of protein D becomes<br>
the N-terminus of the fusion protein.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a fusion protein wherein the N-terminal portion<br>
of protein D (as described above or herein) is fused to the N-terminus or another portion of<br>
a tumour antigen or an immunogenic fragment thereof. More specifically the fusion with<br>
the protein D fragment and the N-terminus or other portion of a tumour antigen may be<br>
effected such that the PRAME or other tumour antigen or derivative thereof as described<br>
herein replaces the C-terminal-fragment of protein D that has been excised. Thus the N-<br>
terminus of protein D becomes the N-terminus of the fusion protein.<br><br>
Other fusion partners or fragments thereof may be included in fusion proteins of the<br>
invention or may replace the protein D element of the present invention, for example in<br>
embodiments comprising the PRAME antigen or a fragment or portion thereof as<br>
described herein. Examples of other fusion partners include:<br>
•	the non-structural protein from influenzae virus, NS1 (hemagglutinin) - typically the<br>
N terminal 81 amino acids are utilised, although different fragments may be used provided<br>
they include T-helper epitopes,<br>
•	LYTA derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which synthesize an N-acetyl-L-<br>
alanine amidase, amidase LYTA, (coded by the lytA gene {Gene, 43 (1986) page 265-<br>
272} such as the repeat portion of the Lyta molecule found in the C terminal end for<br>
example starting at residue 178 such as residues 188 - 305.<br>
Purification of hybrid proteins containing the C-LYTA fragment at its amino terminus has<br>
been described {Biotechnology: 10, (1992) page 795-798.<br>
Fusion proteins of the invention may include an affinity tag, such as for example, a<br>
histidine tail comprising between 5 to 9 such as 6 histidine residues. These residues may,<br>
for example be on the terminal portion of protein D (such as the N-terminal of protein D)<br>
and/or the may be fused to the terminal portion of the PRAME antigen or derivative<br>
thereof, or the tumour antigen or derivative thereof as described herein. Generally<br>
however the histidine tail with be located on terminal portion of the PRAME antigen or<br>
derivative thereof, or the tumour antigen or derivative thereof as described herein such as<br>
the C-terminal end of the PRAME antigen or derivative thereof, or the tumour antigen or<br>
derivative thereof as described herein. Histidine tails may be advantageous in aiding<br>
purification.<br>
The present invention also provides a nucleic acid encoding the proteins of the<br>
present invention. Such sequences can be inserted into a suitable expression vector and<br>
used for DNA/RNA vaccination or expressed in a suitable host. Microbial vectors<br>
expressing the nucleic acid may be used as vaccines. Such vectors include for example,<br>
poxvirus, adenovirus, alphavirus, listeria and monophage.<br><br>
A DNA sequence encoding the proteins of the present invention can be synthesized<br>
using standard DNA synthesis techniques, such as by enzymatic ligation as described by<br>
D.M. Roberts et al. in Biochemistry 1985, 24, 5090-5098, by chemical synthesis, by in<br>
vitro enzymatic polymerization, or by PCR technology utilising for example a heat stable<br>
polymerase, or by a combination of these techniques.<br>
Enzymatic polymerisation of DNA may be carried out in vitro using a DNA<br>
polymerase such as DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) in an appropriate buffer<br>
containing the nucleoside triphosphates dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP as required at a<br>
temperature of 10°-37oC, generally in a volume of 50ul or less. Enzymatic ligation of<br>
DNA fragments may be carried out using a DNA ligase such as T4 DNA ligase in an<br>
appropriate buffer, such as 0.05M Tris (pH 7.4), 0.01M MgCl2, 0.01M dithiothreitol lmM<br>
spermidine, lmM ATP and O.lmg/ml bovine serum albumin, at a temperature of 4°C to<br>
ambient, generally in a volume of 50ml or less. The chemical synthesis of the DNA<br>
polymer or fragments may be carried out by conventional phosphotriester, phosphite or<br>
phosphoramidite chemistry, using solid phase techniques such as those described in<br>
'Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Gene Fragments - A Laboratory Manual' (ed. H.G.<br>
Gassen and A. Lang), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim (1982), or in other scientific<br>
publications, for example M.J. Gait, H.W.D. Matthes, M. Singh, B.S. Sproat, and R.C.<br>

The process of the invention may be performed by conventional recombinant<br>
techniques such as described in Maniatis et al, Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory<br>
Manual; Cold Spring Harbor, 1982-1989.<br>
In particular, the process may comprise the steps of:<br>
i)         preparing a replicable or integrating expression vector<br>
capable, in a host cell, of expressing a DNA polymer<br>
comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes the protein or<br><br>
an immunogenic derivative thereof;<br>
ii)        transforming a host cell with said vector;<br>
iii)       culturing said transformed host cell under conditions<br>
permitting expression of said DNA polymer to produce said<br>
protein; and<br>
iv)       recovering said protein.<br>
The term 'transforming' is used herein to mean the introduction of foreign DNA into a<br>
host cell. This can be achieved for example by transformation, transfection or infection<br>
with an appropriate plasmid or viral vector using e.g. conventional techniques as described<br>
in Genetic Engineering; Eds. S.M. Kingsiran and A.J. Kingsman; Blackwell Scientific<br>
Publications; Oxford, England, 1988. The term 'transformed' or 'transformant' will<br>
hereafter apply to the resulting host cell containing and expressing the foreign gene of<br>
interest.<br>
The expression vectors are novel and also form part of the invention.<br>
The replicable expression vectors may be prepared in accordance with the invention,<br>
by cleaving a vector compatible with the host cell to provide a linear DNA segment having<br>
an intact replicon, and combining said linear segment with one or more DNA molecules<br>
which, together with said linear segment encode the desired product, such as the DNA<br>
polymer encoding the protein of the invention, or derivative thereof, under ligating<br>
conditions.<br>
Thus, the DNA polymer may be preformed or formed during the construction of the<br>
vector, as desired.<br>
The choice of vector will be determined in part by the host cell, which may be<br>
prokaryotic or eukaryotic bvit are generally E. coli or CHO cells. Suitable vectors may<br>
include plasmids for example TMCP14 or pET21 or pET26, pcDNA3, bacteriophages,<br>
cosmids and recombinant viruses.<br><br>
The preparation of the replicable expression vector may be carried out<br>
conventionally with appropriate enzymes for restriction, polymerisation and ligation of the<br>
DNA, by procedures described in, for example, Maniatis et al. cited above.<br>
The recombinant host cell is prepared, in accordance with the invention, by<br>
transforming a host cell with a replicable expression vector of the invention under<br>
transforming conditions. Suitable transforming conditions are conventional and are<br>
described in, for example, Maniatis et al. cited above, or "DNA Cloning" Vol. II, D.M.<br>
Glover ed., IRL Press Ltd, 1985.<br>
The choice of transforming conditiors is determined by the host cell. Thus, a<br>
bacterial host such as E. coli may be treated with a solution of CaCh (Cohen et al, Proc.<br>
Nat. Acad. Sci., 1973, 69, 2110) or with a solution comprising a mixture of RbCl, MnCh,<br>
potassium acetate and glycerol, and then \v th 3-[N-morpholino]-propane-sulphonic acid,<br>
RbCl and glycerol. Mammalian cells in culture may be transformed by calcium co-<br>
precipitation of the vector DNA onto the cells. The invention also extends to a host cell<br>
transformed with a replicable expression vector of the invention.<br>
The DNA may be codon optimized by standard techniques to further facilitate<br>
expression of the relevant host. In one embodiment of the present invention there is<br>
provided DNA encoding a fusion protein comprising a PRAME antigen or portion or<br>
fragment thereof as described herein, in which the nucleotide sequence of the PRAME<br>
antigen or portion or fragment thereof is codon-optimised. In one embodiment, the protein<br>
D nucleotide sequence is not codon-optimised.<br>
Culturing the transformed host cell under conditions permitting expression of the<br>
DNA polymer is carried out conventionally, as described in, for example, Maniatis et al.<br>
and "DNA Cloning" cited above. Thus, pre ferably the cell is supplied with nutrient and<br>
cultured at a temperature below 50°C.<br><br>
The proteins of the present invention may be expressed in prokaryotes or eukaryotes<br>
such as yeast but are often expressed in E. coli. Particular strains of E. coli such as AR58<br>
and BLR DE3 may be employed.<br>
Generally a selection marker of, for example kanamycine resistance or ampicillin<br>
resistance is incorporated to facilitate identification of the successful incorporation of the<br>
recombinant gene/construct into the expression system.<br>
The product is recovered by conventional methods according to the host cell and<br>
according to the localisation of the expression product (intracellular or secreted into the<br>
culture medium or into the cell periplasm)   In one embodiment of the present invention<br>
the expression product is intracellular. In one embodiment of the present invention the<br>
expression product is an insoluble protein   Thus, where the host cell is bacterial, such as<br>
E. coli it may, for example, be lysed physically, chemically or enzymatically and the<br>
protein product isolated from the resulting lysate. Where the host cell is mammalian, the<br>
product may generally be isolated from the nutrient medium or from cell free extracts.<br>
Conventional protein isolation techniques nclude selective precipitation, adsorption<br>
chromatography, and affinity chromatography including a monoclonal antibody affinity<br>
column.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention there is provided a process for producing a<br>
fusion protein as described herein comprising the step of expressing in a cell a fusion<br>
protein comprising a fusion partner protein as described herein. The cell may be a<br>
bacterium. In one embodiment in which the cell is a bacterium, the bacterium may be E.<br>
coli. The process of the present invention may comprise the step of expressing a fusion<br>
protein as described herein in a cell as an insoluble protein. The process may further<br>
comprise the step of lysing the cell and purifying the expressed fusion protein from the<br>
lysed cells.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention there is provided a fusion protein obtained by or<br>
obtainable bv a method or nrocess described herein.<br><br>
The proteins of the present invention are provided either soluble in a liquid form or<br>
in a lyophilised form.<br>
It is generally expected that each human dose will comprise 1 to 1000 ug of protein,<br>
and preferably 30 - 300 ug.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical composition such as vaccine<br>
comprising a fusion protein of the present invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient.<br>
The vaccine may optionally contain one or more other tumour-associated antigens or<br>
polypeptides, or preferably be combined with other cancer vaccines based on a tumour-<br>
associated antigen. For example, these tumour-associated antigens could be antigens as<br>
described herein and/or may be members belonging to the MAGE, LAGE and GAGE<br>
families or WT-1. In one embodiment the tumour-associated antigen may comprise or<br>
consist of the MAGE-A3 antigen.<br>
Vaccine preparation is generally described in Vaccine Design ("The subunit and<br>
adjuvant approach" (eds. Powell M.F. &amp; Newman MJ). (1995) Plenum Press New York).<br>
Encapsulation within liposomes is described by Fullerton, US Patent 4,235,877.<br>
The proteins of the present invention may be preferably adjuvanted in the vaccine<br>
formulation of the invention. Suitable adjuvants may include an aluminium salt such as<br>
aluminium hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminium phosphate, but may also be a salt of<br>
calcium, iron or zinc, or may be an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine, or acylated<br>
sugars, cationically or anionically derivatised polysaccharides, or polyphosphazenes.<br>
Other known adjuvants include CpG containing oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides<br>
are characterised in that the CpG dinucleotide is unmethylated. Such oligonucleotides are<br>
well known and are described in, for example WO 96/02555.<br>
In the formulation of the inventions it may be desirable that the adjuvant<br>
composition induces an immune response preferentially of the TH1 type. In one<br>
embodiment there is provided an adjuvant system including, for example a combination of<br><br>
monophosphoryl lipid A, preferably 3-de-C)-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL)<br>
together with an aluminium salt. The adjuvant may optionally also include CpG<br>
oligonucleotides to preferentially induce a TH1 response.<br>
An enhanced system that may be used in the present invention comprises the<br>
combination of a monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derivative particularly the<br>
combination of QS21 and 3D-MPL as disclosed in WO 94/00153, or, for example a less<br>
reactogenic composition where the QS21 is quenched with cholesterol as disclosed in WO<br>
96/33739.<br>
A formulation that may be used in formulations of the present invention, comprising<br>
QS21 3D-MPL &amp; tocopherol, for example in an oil in water emulsion, is described in WO<br>
95/17210.<br>
Another adjuvant formulation that may be used in formulations of the present invention is<br>
QS21, 3D-MPL &amp; CpG or equivalent thereof, for example in an oil in water emulsion or<br>
as a liposomal formulation.<br>
Accordingly in one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a vaccine<br>
comprising a fusion protein or fusion partner protein as described herein and an adjuvant,<br>
for example as described above.<br>
Combination of FRAME and MAGE<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising (a)<br>
an antigen component comprising a PRAME antigen or fusion protein as described herein<br>
and (b) an antigen component comprising ,i MAGE antigen or fusion protein as described<br>
herein. In one embodiment, the composition may further comprise an adjuvant as<br>
described herein.<br>
The MAGE antigen for use in the combination may comprise the full length MAGE<br>
antigen. Alternatively, the MAGE antigen may comprise an immunogenic portion of<br>
MAGE in which 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more amino acids may be deleted from or<br>
substituted in the amino acid sequence. In one embodiment of the present invention, 2<br><br>
amino acids may be deleted from the N-terminus of the MAGE sequence. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention in which the antigen is MAGE-A3 or an<br>
immunogenic portion thereof, the sequence of MAGE-A3 may be from amino acid 3 to<br>
314ofMAGE-A3.<br>
For the combination described above, either or both of the PRAME and/or MAGE<br>
antigens may be part of a fusion protein or proteins as described herein, or the antigens<br>
may be present in other fusion proteins or may be presented as antigen alone.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising a<br>
fusion protein comprising a PRAME antigen and fusion partner protein as described herein<br>
and a fusion protein comprising a MAGE A3 antigen and fusion partner protein as<br>
described herein.   In an alternative embodiment, the fusion protein comprising the<br>
MAGE-A3 antigen comprises or consists of the MAGE-A3 antigen and a fusion partner<br>
protein comprising approximately the first 109 amino acids of protein D, in which one or<br>
two or more amino acids from protein D are optionally substituted, and in which the signal<br>
sequence of protein D is optionally present, in addition to the first 109 amino acids of<br>
protein D.<br>
The fusion proteins of the present invention may additionally optionally comprise one or<br>
more amino acids as "linkers" between the sequences of the antigen and the fusion partner<br>
protein or between the antigen and a His tail, if present. The amino acids may be unrelated<br>
to the sequences of the antigen and/or fusion partner.<br>
Fusion proteins of the present invention, as described herein, may additionally comprise<br>
amino acids Met-Asp-Pro at the N-terminal end of the fusion protein sequence. The Met<br>
amino acid may be from the original protein D sequence or may be from an unrelated<br>
sequence.<br>
In one embodiment, the sequence of a fusion protein comprising MAGE-A3 and protein D<br>
for use in the present invention is shown in Figure 12 and SEQ ID NO:43.<br><br>
The present invention also extends to methods of preparing said vaccines/<br>
compositions.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Four fusion constructs were prepared and will be referred to herein as Examples/construct!<br>
1, 2, 3 and 4. A codon optimized construct was prepared from example 3 and is<br>
designated as example 3a herein. A codon optimized construct was prepared from<br>
example 4 and is designated as example 4a herein.<br>
In Examples 3a and 4a the sequence in respect of the protein D portion of the molecule is<br>
the same. However, certain codons in the FRAME region were modified, to further<br>
improve expression and, in Example 3a, the linker between PRAME and the his tail has<br>
been removed.<br><br><br>
The fusion proteins of the above examples comprise the amino acids 20-127 of protein D.<br>
The amino acids Met, Asp and Pro were included at the N-terminal of the protein D<br>
fragment (ie amino acids MDP-20-127 Protein D). It is thought that these three additional<br>
amino acids may aid the stability of the protein and/or increase the level of the protein<br>
expression thereof. Amino acid 127 of protein D is fused to the N-terminal of full length<br>
PRAME (ie amino acid 127 of protein D is fused to N-terminal of PRAME). A histidine<br>
tag tail, to aid purification, was included in three of the six proteins. The exact sequence<br>
of the tail is dependent the plasmid used.<br>
Three different types of plasmids, TCMP14 and pET21 or pET26 were constructed: for<br>
each plasmid, DNA encoding for fusion protein was included with and without a histidine<br>
tail.<br><br>
Unless stated otherwise the general strategy below was used in the preparation of each of<br>
the examples.<br>
Cloning strategy for the generation of PD1/3-PRAME (with or without His-tag)<br>
recombinant protein using TCMP14 vector:<br>
Amplification of the sequences presented in the plasmid TCMP14 were done using a three<br>
steps PCR strategy. The vector pH!C348 containing the DNA sequence encoding the entire<br>
protein D gene has been obtained from DT. A. Forsgren, Department of Medical<br>
Microbiology, University of Lund, Malmo General Hospital, Malmo, Sweden. The DNA<br>
sequence of protein D has been published by Janson et al. (1991) { Janson H, LO Heden,<br>
A Grubb, M Ruan, &amp; A Forsgren. 1991. Infect Immun 59:119-125}. The expression vector<br>
pMG81 is a derivative of pBR322, in which bacteriophage X derived control elements for<br>
transcription and translation of foreign inserted genes were introduced (Shatzman et al.,<br>
1983) { Shatzman A, YS Ho, &amp; M Rosenberg. 1983. Experimental Manipulation of Gene<br>
Expression. Inouya (ed) pp 1-14. Academic: NY). In addition, the Ampicillin resistance<br>
gene was exchanged with the Kanamycin resistance gene. The coding sequence for the<br>
portion of NS1 protein (amino acid 4 to 81) was substituted for a multiple cloning sites to<br>
get pMG81 MCS. The coding sequence for the 1/3 protein D (amino acid 20 to 127) was<br>
cloned into pMG81 MCS using BamHI and Ncol restriction sites to get pMG81- 1/3PD.<br>
First, PCR amplification of the section corresponding to amino acid 20-127 of protein D<br>
was done using pMG81-l/3PD vector as template and oligonucleotide sense:<br>

PRAME cDNA obtained from the Ludwig Institute, Brussels, Belgium was inserted in the<br>
Bstxl-Notl sites of the pCDNAl vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCDNA-1-PRAME<br>
recombinant vector. PCR amplification of .he section corresponding to amino acid of<br>
PRAME protein was done using pcDNA-1 -PRAME vector (GSKBio) as template and<br>
oligonucleotide sense:<br>

22) depending if a his-tail (CAN002) or not (CAN029) was added. The final PRAME<br>
sequence inserted in the TCMP14 plasmid was obtained following a PCR amplifications<br>
using the 1/3PD and PRAME gene templates that were generated in the preliminary steps<br>
for template and oligonucleotide sense: C AN008. and antisense: CAN029 or CAN002<br>
depending if an his-tail was present (CAN002) or not (CAN029). Ndel at 5' end and Spel<br>
at 3' end sites were also added for cloning of the fragment into TCMP14 vector.<br>
Construction of the vector design to express the recombinant protein 1/3PD-PRAME<br>
with or without His-tag recombinant protein using pET21 vector :<br>
A recombinant cDNA plasmid called pcDNAl-PRAME (as described in the previous<br>
strategy) containing the coding sequence for PRAME gene and the vector PMG81-1/3PD<br>
(as described in the previous strategy) containing the N-terminal portion of the protein D<br>
coding sequence were used. The cloning strategy included the following steps.<br>
a)	First, the 1/3PD sequence without secretion signal (secretion or signal sequence)was<br>
PCR amplified from plasmid PMG81-1/3PD using the oligonucleotide sense: 5'<br>
AGAGAGCATATGAGCAGCCATTCATCAAATATGGCG (C AN040; SEQ ID NO: 22),<br>
and the antisense:<br>
5' ACGTGGGCGGCCGCGGTTTCAAAGTTTTCTGT2ATTTCTAA(CAN032; SEQ ID NO: 23);<br>
Ndel at the 5' end and Notl at the 3' end sites were also added for cloning of the fragment<br>
into pET21b(+) vector.<br>
b)	The PRAME sequence was PCR amplified from plasmid pcDNAl-PRAME using the<br>
oligonucleotide sense:<br>
5' TTGTTGGCGGCCGCAATGGAACGAAGGCGTTT3TGGGGT (CANO33; SEQ ID NO: 25), and the<br>
antisense:<br>
5' GGAGGACTCGAGGTTAGGCATGAAACAGGGGC&amp;CAG (CAN034; SEQ ID NO: 26); Notl at the<br>
5' end and Xhol at the 3' end sites were also added for cloning of the fragment into<br>
pET21b vector. This amplification resulted in the addition at the C-terminal of the protein<br>
of two amino acids, Leu and Glu, followed by 6 His in pET21b(+) plasmid. For the<br>
generation of the protein without His-tag, a stop codon (TAG) was added at the 3' end of<br>
the PRAME gene by using CAN033 and CAN035 (antisense:<br><br>
   5' GGAGGACTCGAGCTAGTTAGGCATGAAACAGGGGCACAG (CAN035; SEQ ID NO: XX) instead<br>
ofCAN033andCAN034.<br>
c)	Cloning into pET21b(+) plasmid (Invitrogen) of the above amplified fragments.<br>
d)	Removal of Not 1 site between 1/3PD and PRAME by using QuikChange II Site-<br>
Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotide sense:<br>
5' CAGAAAACTTTGAAACCATGGAACGAAGGCG 
5' cgccttcgttccatggtttcaaagttttctg 
e)	Addition of two amino acids Asp and Pro following the Met at position 1 at the N-<br>
terminal of the protein D 1/3 by mutagenesis and using the oligonucleotide sense:<br>
5' GGAGATATACATATGGATCCAAGCAGCCATTCATCAAATATGG (CAN104; SEQ ID NO: XX) and<br>
the antisense:<br>
5' CCATATTTGATGAATGGCTGCTTGGATCCATATGTATATCTCC (CAN105; SEQ ID NO: XX).<br>
Construction of the vector design to express the recombinant protein 1/3PD-PRAME<br>
codon optimized (without or with His tag) in pET26 vector:<br>
The PRAME gene was codon optimized and cloned in pGA4 backbone with the addition<br>
of Not 1 and Xhol sites in the 5' end and the 3' end of the optimized gene respectively.<br>
This plasmid, named 0606420pGA4, was used to clone the gene in fusion with the PD1/3<br>
in the pET26 vector using the following seeps.<br>
a)	Removal of the Notl / Xhol fragment corresponding to the optimized PRAME<br>
sequence with a stop codon at the 3'end of the gene from 0606420pGA4 plasmid.<br>
b)	Cloning of the optimized PRAME fragment into a pET26b(+) plasmid which contain<br>
the 1/3PD previously cloned Ndel/Notl with CAN040 and CAN032 oligonucleotides as<br>
described above and where Asp and Pro amino acids were added in N-terminal by<br>
mutagenesis method with CAN104 and CAN105 oligonucleotides.<br>
c)	Removal of the Notl site by mutagenesis with oligonucleotides: sense<br>
5' GACAGAAAACTTTGAAACCATGGAACGTCGTO3TCTGTGG  (CAN 123", SEQ ID NO". XX) and<br>
antisense<br>
5' CCACAGACGACGACGTTCCATGGTTTCAAAGTTTTCTGTC (CAN124; SEQ ED NO: XX). This<br>
resulted in 1/3PD-PRAME codon optimized fusion protein without His-tail.<br><br>
d)	The plasmid was then used as a template; for the generation of 1/3PD-PRAME codon<br>
optimized with 6 His plasmid. PCR amplification of the fusion protein was done with<br>
oligonucleotides sense<br>
51 GGAATTCCATATGGATCCAAGCAGCCATTC (CAN199; SEQ ED NO: XX) and a antisense<br>
5' GGAGCTCTCGAGTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTTCGGCATAAAGCACGGGC (CAN198; SEQ ID<br>
NO: XX); Ndel at the 5' end, Xhol at the .5' end sites followed by 6 His and a stop codon<br>
were also added for cloning of the fragment into pET26b(+) vector.<br>
e)	Cloning of the amplified fragment in pET26b
For the production of the fusion protein, the DNA construct has been cloned into the<br>
expression vector TCMP14. This plasmid utilizes signals from lambda phage DNA to<br>
drive the transcription and translation of inserted foreign genes. The vector contains the<br>
lambda PL promoter PL, operator OL and two utilization sites (NutL and NutR) to relieve<br>
transcriptional polarity effects when N protein is provided (Gross et al., 1985. Mol. &amp; Cell.<br>
Biol. 5:1015).<br>
The plasmid expressing the pD-PRAME fusion protein was designed so the PRAME<br>
amino acids were added to the C-terminal of a 108 amino acids derivative of pD without<br>
its signal sequence (secretion or signal sequence) (i.e. residues 20-127). To this<br>
construction, three unrelated amino acids (Met and Asp and a Proline) were added at the<br>
N-terminal of the derivative of pD, and for certain constructions a his tail at the C-<br>
terminal of the PRAME amino acids was included (see table A above). This construct<br>
could alternatively be described as containing 109 amino acids derivative of pD, if the N-<br>
terminal Met is considered to come from trie pD sequence.<br>
Host Strain and Transformation<br>
Hosts from E. Coli strain AR58 (Mott et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol 82, pp 88-92,<br>
January 1985, Biochemistry) were transformed with plasmid DNA for Examples/<br>
constructs 1 and 2.<br>
The AR58 lysogenic E. coli strain used for the production of Examples/constructs 1<br>
and 2 is a derivative of the standard NIH E coli K12 strain N99 (F- su- galK2, lacZ- thr-).<br>
It contains a defective lysogenic lambda phage (galE::TN10,1 Kil- cI857 DH1). The Kil-<br><br>
phenotype prevents the shut off of host macromolecular synthesis. The cI857 mutation<br>
confers a temperature sensitive lesion to the cl repressor. The DH1 deletion removes the<br>
lambda phage right operon and the hosts bio, uvr3, and chlA loci. The AR58 strain was<br>
generated by transduction of N99 with a P lambda phage stock previously grown on an<br>
SA500 derivative (galE::TN10,1 Kil- cI85'? DHI). The introduction of the defective<br>
lysogen into N99 was selected with tetracyoline by virtue of the presence of a TN10<br>
transposon coding for tetracyclin resistance in the adjacent galE gene. N99 and SA500 are<br>
E.coli K12 strains derived from Dr. Martin Rosenberg's laboratory at the National<br>
Institutes of Health.<br>
Vectors containing the PL promoter, are introduced into an E. coli lysogenic host to<br>
stabilize the plasmid DNA. Lysogenic host strains contain replication-defective lambda<br>
phage DNA integrated into the genome (Shatzman et al., 1983; In Experimental<br>
Manipulation of Gene Expression. Inouya (ed) pp 1-14. Academic Press NY). The lambda<br>
phage DNA directs the synthesis of the cl repressor protein which binds to the OL<br>
repressor of the vector and prevents binding of RNA polymerase to the PL promoter and<br>
thereby transcription of the inserted gene. The cl gene of the expression strain AR58<br>
contains a temperature sensitive mutation so thai PL directed transcription can be regulated<br>
by temperature shift, i.e. an increase in culture temperature inactivates the repressor and<br>
synthesis of the foreign protein is initiated This expression system allows controlled<br>
synthesis of foreign proteins especially of those that may be toxic to the cell (Shimataka &amp;<br>
Rosenberg, 1981. Nature 292:128).<br>
Hosts from E. Coli strain BLR (DE3) Novagen, WI, USA (catalogue number:<br>
69053-4) BLR (DE3) Novagen, WI, USA (catalogue number: 69053-4) BLR is a recA~<br>
derivative of BL21 that improves plasmid monomer yields and may help stabilize target<br>
plasmids containing repetitive sequences or whose products may cause the loss of the DE3<br>
prophage (1,2) were transformed with plasmid DNA from examples/constructs 3 and 4.<br>
Each of transformation was carried out by standard methods with CaCh-treated cells<br>
(Hanahan D. « Plasmid transformation by Simanis. » In Glover, D. M. (Ed), DNA cloning.<br>
IRL Press London. (1985): p. 109-135.).<br><br>
Growth and induction of bacterial host strain<br>
	Culture<br>
Bacteria were grown-on 20 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (BD) + 1% (w/v) glucose<br>
(Laboratoire MAT, catalogue number: GR-0101) + antibiotic(Carbenicillin 100 ug/ml for<br>
pET21b, kanamycin 40 |ag/ml for TCMPI -). Cultures were incubated at 33°C, for AR58<br>
cells and at 37°C, for BLR (DE3) cells until an O.D.60onm around 0.8.<br>
•	Induction<br>
At O.D.6oonm around 0.8, the cultures BLR (DE3) were induced at 1 mM isopropyl p-D-1-<br>
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; EMD Chemicals Inc., catalogue number: 5815) and<br>
incubated for 2 hours or 3 hours at 37°C alihough solubility may be increased if a lower<br>
temperature is used.<br>
At O.D.6oonm around 0.8, the cultures AR5S were induced by heat activation at 37°C and<br>
incubated for 7 hours.<br>
The bacterial growth was adequate for the Iwo expression systems.<br>
•	Extraction and Purification of the Protein<br>
Upon expression of the polypeptide in culture, cells are typically harvested by<br>
centrifugation then disrupted by physical or chemical means (if the expressed polypeptide<br>
is not secreted into the media) and the resulting crude extract retained to isolate the<br>
polypeptide of interest. BugBuster™ Protein Extraction Reagent is used under conditions<br>
recommended by the suppliers (Novagen).<br>
PDl/3-Prame-his protein purification<br>
E. coli cell paste was resuspended in 20 mM Tns buffer pH 8.5 then passed through<br>
homogenizer system (Panda from Niro Soavi S.p.A. - 2 passes - 750 bars). After addition<br>
of 2 mM MgCl2 and Benzonase (50 U/mlh homogenate was incubated 1 hour at room<br>
temperature (RT) under gentle agitation then centrifuged 30 minutes at 15900 g and RT.<br>
Resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 m VI Tris buffer pH 8.5 containing 1% Sodium<br>
Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) and 60 mM Glutathione and incubated 30 minutes at RT under<br>
gentle agitation. After centrifugation 30 minutes at 15900 g and RT, pellet was discarded.<br>
Centrifugation supernatant was 10-fold diluted in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 6.66 M<br>
Urea, 0.333 M sodium chloride (NaCl) and 11.11 mM Imidazole and then subjected to<br>
chromatographic separation on a Nickel ion metal affinity column (IMAC Sepharose 6 FF<br><br>
-	GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a 20 mM Iris buffer pH 8.5 containing 0.1% SDS, 6.0 M<br>
Urea, 0.3 M NaCl and 10 mM Imidazole.  After washing of the column with 20 mM Tris<br>
buffer pH 8.5 containing 0.5% Sarcosyl, 6.0 M Urea, 0.3 M NaCl and 10 mM Imidazole,<br>
antigen was eluted from the column by increasing the concentration of Imidazole up to 40<br>
mM in the same washing buffer. After addition of phosphate up to 50 mM, antigen<br>
positive eluate was passed through a Macro-Prep Ceramic Hydroxyapatite type II column<br>
(Bio-Rad) equilibrated in a 20 mM Tris buffer pH 8.5 containing 50 mM phosphate, 0.5%<br>
Sarcosyl, 6.0 M Urea and 0.3 M NaCl. Hydroxyapatite flow-through containing the antigen<br>
was then diafiltered against 5 mM Borate buffer pH 9.8 containing 3.15% Sucrose on an<br>
Omega 30 kDa membrane (Pall). UltrafiHration retentate was sterilized by filtration<br>
through a 0.45/0.22 um Cellulose acetate membrane (Sartorius). Purified material was<br>
stored at -70°C.<br>
An alternative purification process has alsc been used, which differs from the above<br>
process in the following steps:<br>
-	No benzonase treatment<br>
-	No shift from SDS to sarcosyl on IMAC column (SDS from extraction up to HA step)<br>
-	The buffer used for the diafiltration was 5 mM Tris buffer pH 8.5 - 0.5 M Argimne.<br>
This alternative purification process resulted in incomplete SDS removal with residual<br>
value around 0.05 and 0.085%.<br>
•       Purification<br>
The expressed recombinant proteins were purified from supernatant fractions obtained<br>
after centrifugation of induced E. coli using a His-Bind metal chelation resin (QIAgen,<br>
Chatsworth, CA) according to the instructions from the resin manufacturer.<br>

Formulation of Vaccine preparation using fusion proteins:<br><br>
The fusion proteins of the invention can be formulated into vaccines which are either<br>
adjuvanted or not. In one embodiment, as an adjuvant, the formulation may comprise a<br>
mixture of 3 de -O-acylated monophosphoiyl lipid A (3D-MPL) and QS21 in an oil/water<br>
emulsion. The adjuvant system SBAS2 has been previously described WO 95/17210. The<br>
adjuvant for use in the present invention may alternatively comprise 3 de -O-acylated<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL), QS21 and CpG in an oil-in water formulation or in a<br>
liposomal formulation.<br>
3D-MPL: is an immunostimulant derived from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the<br>
Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella minnesota. MPL has been deacylated and is lacking<br>
a phosphate group on the lipid A moiety. This chemical treatment dramatically reduces<br>
toxicity while preserving the immunostimulant properties (Ribi, 1986).<br>
It is believed that 3D-MPL combined with various vehicles may strongly enhance both the<br>
humoral and a TH1 type of cellular immunity.<br>
QS21: is a natural saponin molecule extracted from the bark of the South American<br>
tree Quillaja saponaria Molina. A purification technique developed to separate the<br>
individual saponines from the crude extracts of the bark, permitted the isolation of the<br>
particular saponin, QS21, which is a triteipene glycoside demonstrating stronger adjuvant<br>
activity and lower toxicity as compared with the parent component. QS21 has been shown<br>
to activate MHC class I restricted CTLs to several subunit Ags, as well as to stimulate Ag<br>
specific lymphocytic proliferation (Kensil, 1992).<br>
It is thought that there may be a synergistic effect of combinations of MPL and QS21<br>
in the induction of both humoral and TH1 type cellular immune responses.<br>
The oil/water emulsion comprises an organic phase made of 2 oils<br>
(a tocopherol and squalene), and an aqueous phase of PBS containing Tween 80 as<br>
emulsifier. The emulsion comprised 5% squalene 5% tocopherol 0.4% Tween 80 and had<br>
an average particle size of 180 nm and is known as SB62 (see WO 95/17210). The<br>
resulting oil droplets should have a size of approximately 180 nm.<br><br>
The adjuvant for use in the present invention may be formulated as a combination of<br>
MPL and QS21, in an oil/water emulsion or in a liposomal formulation. This preparation<br>
should be delivered in vials of 0.7 ml to be admixed with lyophilised antigen or fusion<br>
protein (vials containing from 30 to 300 ng, antigen).<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides may also be used. Examples oligonucleotides for use<br>
in adjuvants or vaccines of the present invention include CpG containing oligonucleotides,<br>
generally containing two or more dinucleotide CpG motifs separated by at least three, more<br>
often at least six or more nucleotides. A CpG motif is a cytosine nucleotide followed by a<br>
guanine nucleotide. The CpG oligonucleotides are typically deoxynucleotides. In one<br>
embodiment the internucleotide in the otigonucleotide is phosphorodithioate, or more<br>
preferably a phosphorothioate bond, although phosphodiester and other internucleotide<br>
bonds are within the scope of the invention. Also included within the scope of the<br>
invention are oligonucleotides with mixed internucleotide linkages. Methods for producing<br>
phosphorothioate oligonucleotides or phosphorodithioate are described in US5,666,153,<br>
US 5,278,302 and WO 95/26204.<br>
Examples of oligonucleotides are as follows:<br>
TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ACG TT (CpG 1826; SEQ ED NO: 36)<br>
TCT ccc AGC GTG CGC CAT (CpG 1758; SEQ ID NO: 37)<br>
ACC GAT GAC GTC GCC GGT GAC GGC ACC ACG TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT<br>
(CpG 2006; SEQ ID NO: 38)<br>
TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT (CpG 1668; SEQ ID NO: 39)<br>
TCG ACG TTT TCG GCG CGC GCC G (CpG 5456; SEQ ID NO: 40),<br>
the sequences may contain phosphorothioaie modified intemucleotide linkages.<br>
Alternative CpG oligonucleotides may comprise one or more sequences above in that they<br>
have inconsequential deletions or additions thereto.<br>
The CpG oligonucleotides may be synthesized by any method known in the art (for<br>
example see EP 468520). Conveniently, such oligonucleotides may be synthesized<br>
utilising an automated synthesizer.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention an adjuvant combination for use in the<br>
invention includes one or more of the following components: 3D-MPL and QS21 (EP 0<br>
671 948 Bl); oil in water emulsions comprising 3D-MPL and QS21 (WO 95/17210, WO<br>
98/56414); or 3D-MPL formulated with other carriers (EP 0 689 454 Bl). Other adjuvant<br>
systems that may be used in the present invention comprise a combination of 3D-MPL,<br>
QS21 and a CpG oligonucleotide as described in US6558670 and US6544518.<br>
The final vaccine maybe obtained after reconstitution of the lyophilized<br>
formulation.<br>
