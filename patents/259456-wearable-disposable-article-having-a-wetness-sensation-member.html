				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to hygienic absorbent articles, such as diapers, training pants and the like. Particularly, the invention is directed to training pants facilitating the<br>
toilet training process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Absorbent articles are well known in the art. These articles typically have an absorbent core held or positioned in proximity to the body of a wearer during use by a fastening system in order to capture and absorb bodily exudates discharged from the wearer. Typical absorbent articles include a topsheet facing the wearer, which permits fluid exudates to pass through, and a backsheet, which prevents the exudates from escaping from the absorbent article.<br>
Disposable absorbent articles such as diapers are designed to absorb and contain bodily waste in order to prevent soiling of the body and clothing of the wearer. The disposable diapers typically comprise a single design available in different sizes to fit a variety of wearers ranging from newborns to toddlers undergoing toilet training. The design of the diaper typically affects performance, such as, ability to absorb and contain bodily waste. The size of the diaper typically affects fit, for example, the size of the diaper waist opening, the size of the openings around the thighs, and the length or "pitch" of the diaper.<br>
The toilet training stage may be referred to as the "point of exit" as toddlers typically leave the product category once training is successfully completed. The age at which children are toilet trained in "devloped" countries has increased steadily over the past several decades and is now in the range of about 24-48 months. One reason toilet training has become delayed is due to significant technical improvements in diaper dryness and comfort.   In modem diapers, the child has dry.skin even after one or more<br>
urinations. As a result, the child feels little or no discomfort and often may not even be<br>
aware that they have urinated.	'<br>
Many parents have the child wear cotton training pants or underwear during toilet training so the child feels discomfort following urination in their "pants". It is believed that such discomfort assists with learning or provides motivation to learn proper toilet training. Cotton training pants leave the skin wet and, due to their high breathability, promote evaporative cooling of the skin, further enhancing discomfort Tlie current tradeoff in this approach, however, is that cotton training pants have poor urine containment leaning to wet clothing and often times, wet surroundings e.g. carpeting, furniture, etc. Clearly there is a need to provide a training signal to the toilet training child while preventing urine leakage and unnecessary changes of clothing.<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to provide a wearable article that can facilitate toilet training by enhancing a wearer's awareness that urination has occurred while at the same time providing the protection of an absorbent article, preventing soiling of the wearer's clothing and surroundings. Particularly, it would be desirable to provide such a wearable article providing an effective signal of urination by ensuring that the wearer feels an uncomfortable wetness sensation resulting from urination.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to solve one or more of the problems found in the art, a wearable article, such as an absorbent article, is provided with a wetness sensation member held in close contact with a wearer's skin during use that enhances the wearer's awareness that a discharge of bodily exudates, such as urine, has occurred. The wetness sensation member comprises a permeable layer and an impermeable layer disposed in a face-to-face arrangement with the permeable layer. The wetness sensation member is typically in proximity to the weare's urethra so that once the wearer urinates wetting an area of the . wetness sensation member, the urine penetrates through the thickness of the permeable layer in the z-direction to the impermeable layer which provides a path of least resistance supporting the flow of urine in the x-y plane. This enables the urine to wet a large area of the wetness sensation member before being absorbed into the absorbent core.    The<br>
wetness sensation member is held in contact with the wearer's skin during use thereby enhancing the wearer's awareness that urination has occurred.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While this specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming that which is regarded as the invention, it is anticipated that the invention can be more readily understood through reading the following detailed description of the invention and study of the included drawings.<br>
The present invention provides a wearable article having a wetness sensation member that increases a wearer's awareness that urination has occurred by causing the urine discharged from the body of the wearer to wet an effective area of the member held in close contact with the wearer's skin during use. TIic wetness sensation member is equally applicable to wearable articles such as disposable absorbent articles including training pants, incontinence briefs, incontinence undergarments, absorbent inserts, diaper holders and liners, feminine hygiene garments, and the like. One embodiment of an absorbent article of the present invention is a unitary disposable absorbent article, such as the disposable diaper 20, shown in Figure I. However, preferably, the present invention is applicable to disposable training pants and pull-on diapers designed to facilitate toilet training.<br>
DEFINrnONS<br>
As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings:<br>
"Absorbent article" refers to devices that absorb and contain liquid, and more specifically, refers to devices that arc placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body.<br>
"Longitudinal" is a direction running parallel to the maximum linear dimension of the article and includes directions within ±45" of the longitudinal direction.<br>
The "lateral" or "transverse" direction is orthogonal to the longitudinal direction.<br>
The "z-direction" is orthogonal to both the longitudinal and transverse directions.<br>
The "x-y plane refers to the plane congruent with the longitudinal and transverse directions.<br>
The term "disposable" is used herein to describe absorbent articles that generally are not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an absoit)ent article (i.e., they are intended to be discarded after a single use and, preferably, to be recycled, composted or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally compatible manner).<br>
As used herein, the term "disposed" is used to mean that an element(s) is formed (joined and positioned) in a particular place or position as a unitary structure with other elements or as a separate element joined to another element.<br>
As used herein, the term "joined" encompasses configurations whereby an element is directly secured to another element by affixing the element directly to the other element, and configurations whereby an element is indirectly secured to another element by affixing the element to intermediate member(s) which in tum are affixed to the other element.<br>
A "unitary" absorbent article refers to absorbent articles which are formed of separate parts united together to form a coordinated entity so that they do not require separate manipulative parts like a separate holder and liner.<br>
As used herein, the term "diaper" refers to an absorbent article generally worn by infants and incontinent persons about the lower torso.<br>
As used herein, the term "impermeable" generally refers to articles and/or elements that are not penetrative by fluid in the liquid sate tiirough the entire Z-directional thickness of the article under pressure of 0.14 lb/in" or less. Preferably, the impermeable article or element is not penetrative by fluid in the liquid state under pressures of 0.5 lb/in" or less. More preferably, the impenneable article or element is not penetrative by fluid in the liquid state under pressures of 1.0 lb/in or less.<br>

An exemplaiy wetness sensation member according to the present invention is shown in Figure 2. The wetness sensation member 50 comprises a permeable layer 52 and an impermeable layer 54 disposed opposite the permeable layer 52. The impermeable layer is preferably impermeable to fluid in the liquid state but permeable to vapor so that it is breathable. The wetness sensation member 50 according to the present invention preferably comprises a permeable body-facing layer (upper layer) and an impermeable layer (lower layer) opposite the body facing layer.<br>
During insults of urine, the permeable layer 52 allows urine to penetrate in the z-direction and also provides a medium for the flow of urine in the x-y plane via wicking. The impermeable layer supports the flow of liquid between the permeable and impermeable layers and retains the liquid thereby expanding the wetted area of the wetness sensation member, which is held in as intimate and continuous contact as possible with the wearer's skin. The combination of peneu-ation and flow enables the urine to spread out and effectively wet a large area before being absorbed into the core, which in turn maximizes the wetness signal experienced by the wearer.<br>
Exemplary permeable layers suitable for use in the wetness sensation members of the present invention include nonwovens, foams, woven materials, etc. The permeable layer is preferably hydrophilic and capable of retaining at least 4-12 g/g urine against<br>
gravity. Exemplary impermeable layefff'suitable for use in the wetness sensation members<br>
of the present invention include polyolefimc films, niicroporous or breathable films, other<br>
films, and hydrophobic nonwovens having a hydrohead greater than about 0.14 lb/in".<br>
Suitable hydrophobic nonwovens include SM (spunbond meltblown), SMS (spunbond<br>
meltblown   spunbond),   and  SMMS   (spunbond   meltblown   meltblown   spunbond)<br>
composites.<br>
The benefits of the wetness sensation member can be shown by comparison of the<br>
strikethrough time for a given sample of temperature sensation member and a topsheet<br>
material. Strikethrough is.the time required for a given volume of surface applied liquid<br>
to enter a given material into an underlying absorbent core.   The testing is performed<br>
according to Topsheet Strikethrough Time Test provided.   The testing was performed<br>
comparing a wetness sensation member composed of a 18 g/m~ spunbond nonwoven<br>
laminated to a 20 g/nC SMMS nonwovwi via 6 g/m^ adhesive to a topsheet material<br>
composed of 18 gsm Spunbond nonwoven.   The results of the testing revealed the<br>
wetness sensation member to have a strikethrough time on the average about 3.4 times the<br>
strikethrough time of the topsheet material. TTie results of the testing are illustrated in the<br>
table below.    Strikethrough Test<br>
(Table Removed) Topsheet Strikethrough Time Procedure Perform the analysis in a room conditioned at 73 + 2° F and 50 + 2% relative humidity. Set up a ring stand to support a clean, automatic filling buret and a separatory funnel so that the tip of the buret extends into the separatory funnel. Position the Plexiglas base plate of the strike- through/rewet apparatus on the base of the ring stand beneath the tip of the separatory funnel so that the tip of the ftmnel will be 1-1/8 + 1/32 inch above the top of the Plexiglas base plate. Using Tygon tubing, connect the aspirator bottle to the automatic filling buret. Place a magnetic stirring bar in the aspirator bottle. Fill the bottle with synthetic urine test solution (see Solution). Turn on the motor to the magnetic stirrer and keep it on for the duration of the testing. After the test solution has stirred for a minimum of 30 minutes, rinse the buret at least 3 times with the solution before filling to the zero mark. Make sure tlie buret tip is filled also. Place 15 ml of test solution in the separatory funnel and drain to wet the walls of the funnel. Repeat for a total of two times. The buret must be rinsed at least three times and the walls of the separatoiy funnel wetted twice, using these techniques, before the beginning of each testing session. "Hiese preparation steps are performed only after the test solution has stirred at least 30 minutes.<br>
All testing is done with the test solution in the aspirator bottle under agitation.<br>
NOTE: Keeping the buret full of the test solution when not in use will prevent it from becoming dirty on the inside. Dirty glassware, including the buret, separatory funnel, and strikethrough plate will not drain properly. Once a week, or more often if necessary, clean the buret, the separatory funnel, and the strikethrough plate thoroughly with an Alconox solution. (To prepare Alconox solution, dissolve about eight grams of Alconox in one liter of warm water.) Clean the strikethrough plate cavity, the bottom of the strikethrough plate, the plastic points at the bottom of the cavity, and around and between the electrodes with Alconox solution and a pipe cleaner. Rinse the buret, the separatory funnel, and the strikethrough plate several times with distilled water and then with tlie test solution before using. All Alconox must be removed before using for further testing.<br>
The amount of test solution used in the strikethrough/rewet test sequence is a characteristic of the lot of Eaton-Dikeman #939 filter paper being used. For each issue of Eaton-Dikeman #939 filter paper provided, the total volume of test solution to be used for the strikethrough/rewet sequence will be specified in tenns of an "X-loading" factor, which represents the ml of test solution to be used per g of filter paper stack weight.<br>
To deiermine the total solution volume to be used in milliliters, multiply the "X-loading" factor by the filter paper stack weight; i.e., if the "X-Ioading" for a lot of papei is 3.90 ml/g and filter paper stack weight determined was 4.35 g, the total test solution volume required is 3.90 x 4.35 = 17.0 ml.<br>
Place the topsheet sample to be tested on a previously weighted 4 in. x 4 in. three sheet filter paper stack with the side of the topsheet, which will be next to the baby facing up. Place the total sample filter paper stack and topsheet on the dry Plexiglas base plate with the fabric facing up. (Plexiglas base plate and strikethrough plate must be dried between tests with a Bounty towel.) Center the dry strikethrough plate on tlie topsheet and center the entire assembly under the stem of the separatory funnel with the tip of the funnel 1-1/8 + 1/32 in. above the top of the Plexiglas base plate.<br>
Strikethrough<br>
With the separatory funnel stopcock closed, discharge 5.0 ml of test solution from the buret into the funnel.<br>
With the strikethrough/rewet apparatus timer power ON. the timer set to zero, and the wires connected to the strikethrough plate, start the test measurement by suddenly opening the funnel stopcock and discharging the 5.0 ml into the strikethrough plate sample cavity. The initial liquid discharge will start the timer and after the liquid has emptied from the cavity, the timer will shut off.  After the timer has shut off, record the strikethrough time<br>
to the nearest 0.01-second. Do not remove the strikethrough plate, sample pad, etc. from under the separatory funnel. Close the separatory stopcock.<br>
TTie ability of wetness sensation member to support the flow of liquid in the x-y plane can be measured by its wicking capability. The wicking capability of the wetness sensation member was measured according to INDA Standard test* 1ST 10.1 (95) Paragraph 10. Liquid Wicking Rate. The test is the measure of the time in seconds for liquid to wick vertically 1.0 inch. The results of the test, summarized in the table below, reveal that wetness sensation member can support vertical wicking of 1.0 inch in an average time of 6.8 seconds whereas the topsheet material was incapable of reaching the 1.0-inch level of vertical wicking.<br>
Vertical Wicking Test<br>
(Table Removed) The wetness sensation member according to the present invention may be arranged in an absorbent article in a variety of configurations. In addition, absorbent articles may include a single wetness sensation member or a plurality of wetness sensation members. In any event, the wetness sensation member(s) are preferably a part of, or attached to, an element or web, such as a topsheet, which is reliably held against the skin of the wearer. In addition, the wetness sensation member(s) are preferably positioned within the absorbent article to enhance the likelihood of being wetted with urine.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of a wetness sensation member 50 disposed with the topsheet 24 is illustrated in Figures 3a and 3b. As shown, the wetness sensation member 50 comprises a separate composite member attached to the topsheet 24. The wetness sensation member 50 comprises a permeable body-facing layer 52, and impermeable layer 54 opposite the body-facing layer. For this embodiment, the wetness sensation member 50 is preferably configured and assembled to enhance the likelihood of making contact with the wearer's skin during use. For instance, the impermeable layer 54 of the wetness<br>
sensation member 50 may be bonded to the topsheet 24 using adhesives, ultrasonic bonds, radio frequency bonds, or other suitable means while either the topsheet 24 or the wetness sensation member 50 jselastically foreshortened to deflect die member 50 towards the wearer's skin.<br>
In an embodiment illustrated in Figure 4, a wetness sensation member 50 comprising a separate com|)Osite member is disposed on the topsheet 24 of a pull-on type diaper. For this embodiment, the wetness sensation member 50 has elastic properties and includes a first longitudinal end 70 attached to the first waist region 36 and a second longitudinal end 72 attached to the second waist region 38. In addition, a center portion 74 of the member 50 is preferably attached to the crotch region 37 of the diaper 20 in order to stabilize the member and facilitate fitting the article to the wearer, prevent interference with bowel movements and ensure good contact with the wearer's skin.<br>
In an alternate embodiment shown in Figures 5a and 5b, the imperaieable layer 54 of the wetness sensation member 50 is attached to the inner surface of the topsheet 24 such that at least a portion of the topsheet 24 forms the permeable layer 52 of the wetness sensation member 50. For this embodiment, the topsheet 24 is preferably elastically foreshortened to deflect the wetness sensation member 50 into contact with the wearer's skin. Alternatively, this embodiment may include a topsheet that is shorter in length than the backsheet, having the longitudinal ends of the topsheet contiguous with the longitudinal ends of the backsheet so that as the diaper is fitted around the wearer, the topsheet is forced into contact with the wearer's skin.<br>
Regardless of the specific construction, the position and/or structure of the wetness sensation member 50 should enable the member to be wetted with urine and thereafter held in contact with the wearer's skin. The wetness sensation member is preferably disposed in at least a portion of the crotch region 37 of the diaper 20, centered about the longitudinal centerline 42. The wetness sensation member 50 may extend over a portion of the disposable absorbent article spanning less than one half of the length of the article or else extend a substantial part of the article spanning more than one half the length of the article.    Furthermore, the wetness sensation member 50 is preferably<br>
coordinated with the wearer's urethra in order to cover the area in which urine initiates contact with the disposable absorbent article.<br>
Absorbent articles according to the present invention may include a plurality of wetness sensation members disposed on the body-facing surface of the article. An example of an embodiment providing a plurality of wetness sensation members is shown in Figures 6a and 6b. Two impermeable layers 54a, 54b, are attached to the bottom surface of the topsheet 24 forming two wetness sensation members 50a, 50b. For this embodiment, the impermeable layers 54a, 54b are disposed between the topsheet and the absoibeni core 28 so that the topsheet fonns the permeable layers 52 of the wetness sensation members. The two impermeable layers 54a, 54b are disposed parallel to and spaced apart from the longitudinal centerline 42 of the diaper 20. The spacing is determined to allow enough liquid to pass through to the core so as to prevent flooding that can result in leakage of the absorbent article during urination, while at the same time enable enough liquid to flow and wick towards the impenneable layers forming the wetness sensation members. The spacing between the impermeable layers can be about 10 mm but can range from about 5 mm to about 15 mm and from about 8 mm and to about 12 mm. For this embodiment, the impermeable layers 54a, 54b are attached to the lower side of the topsheet 24 using adhesives, ultrasonic bonds, radio frequency bonds, or other suitable means. The attachment can comprise bonds covering the entire interface between the impermeable layers and the topsheet, spot bonds or bonds along the longitudinal and transverse edges of the impermeable layers. Although the embodiment described in Figures 6a and 6b show only two wetness sensation members, other absorbent article embodiments having three or more wetness sensation members are contemplated.<br>
As shown in Figures 6a and 6b the spacing of the impermeable layers provide room for an elongated slit opening 80 in the topsheet 24. The elongated slit opening 80 is adapted to receive feces from the wearer and isolate the same from the wearer's skin. As shown, the slit opening 80 is preferably inteq^osed between the wetness sensation members 50a, 50b along the longitudinal centerline 42 of the diaper 20. Elasticized regions 82 located adjacent to the slit opening 80 maintain alignment of the slit opening<br>
80 with the wearer's anus during use. The elasticized regions S2 may also deflect the wetness sensation members 50a, 50b towards the wearer's skin to maintain contact therewith during use. Exemplary elasticized topsheets including elongated slit openings are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Number 09/694,751, which is incorporated herein by reference. AltCTnatively, the impermeable layers 54a, 54b of the wetness sensation members 50a, 50b may be elastically foreshortened to provide benefits of the elasticized regions 82 disposed in the topsheet 24.<br>
In another alternate embodiment shown in Figures 7a and 7b, the topsheet 24 foiiiTS tlie permeable layer 52 similar to the previous embodiment, however, the impermeable layers 54a, 54b are disposed in two parallel Z-foIds 90 formed in the topsheet 24 along the longitudinal length of the diaper 20. The Z-folded topsheet may be attached to the underlying layers along the longitudinal edges of the topsheet 24 allowing the poition between the Z-folds of the topsheet 24 to float freely. Elastic elements 92 are disposed along the impermeable layers 54a, 54b in order to deflect Uie center portion of the Z-folded topsheet outward away from the absorbent core 28. The elastic elements 92 may be disposed along the outer edges of the impermeable layers 54a. 54b as shown in Figure 7b, or alternatively, may be disposed in face-to-face relationship with the impermeable layers 54a, 54b. The combination of the Z-folded topsheet 24 and the elastic elements 92 maintains the wetness sensation members in contact with the wearer's skin in the event that the diaper sags or fits loosely around the wearer.<br>
In order to prevent the portion of the topsheet between the Z-folds from being forced into the gluteal groove and from interfering with the barrier leg cuffs, the spacing between the Z-folds can be about 65 mm and can range from about 50 mm to about 90 mm. Further, in order to control deflection of the portion of the topsheet between the Z-folds, transverse bonds are produced between the Z-folds in the first waist region, the second waist region and the crotch region using adhesives, ultrasonic bonds, radio frequency bonds, or other suitable means in order to control deflection. These transverse bonds attach the Z-folded section to the body-facing surface of the topsheet and the section between the Z-foIds to the underlying core.<br>
In addition to incorporating the wetness sensation member with the topsheet, the wetness sensation member of the present invention may also be integrated with other components of the diaper such as the barrier leg cuffs. The barrier leg cuffs may be made from either permeable or impermeable material. In either case, the barrier leg cuff material may form one of the layers of the wetness sensation member.<br>
An example of wetaess sensation members integrated with the barrier leg cuffs is shown in Figures 8a and 8b. The diaper 20 for this embodiment includes barrier leg cuffs 100a, 100b made from impermeable material. The barrier leg cuffs 100a, 100b extend along the longitudinal edges of the diaper 20 in a paraliei arrangement disposed on the body-facing surface of the topsheet 24 leaving an exposed center portion 184 of the topsheet 24 therebetween. For the embodiment shown in Hgures 8a and 8b, wetness sensation members 150a, 150b are incorporated with the barrier leg cuffs 100a, 100b such that the barrier leg cuff material provides the impermeable layer of the wetness sensation members. The permeable layer 110 can extend the length of the barrier leg cuffs, preferably the length of the crotch region 37 and the front waist region 36, and are disposed on portions of the cuff closest to the longitudinal axis 42 of tfie diaper 20 to increase the likelihood of becoming wetted during urination. As shown in Figures 8a and 8b, the barrier leg cuffs 100a, 100b include Z-folded configurations with inner folds 105a, 105b disposed near the longitudinal axis 42 of the diaper 20 leaving a center portion 184 of the topsheet 24 exposed. The Z-folded leg cuffs 100a, 100b also include outer folds 106a, 106b having elastic elements 108 disposed therein. During use, the elastic elements 108 deflect the leg cuffs away from the topsheet 24, towards the skin of the wearer.<br>
The embodiments of wetness sensation members disclosed hereunder perform effectively when held in contact with the skin of the wearer. In order to ensure that contact is made with the wearer's skin during use, the body-facing portion of the wetness sensation members may include a topical adhesive or body adhering composition, which acts to hold the wetness sensation member in place during use. The topical adhesive may be applied to at least a portion of the body-facing surface of the wetness sensation member. However, the body adhering composition may also be integral with the material making up the body-facing layer of the wetness sensation member.   Further, the body<br>
adhering composition may be disposed on any portion of the wetness sensation member<br>
i<br>
