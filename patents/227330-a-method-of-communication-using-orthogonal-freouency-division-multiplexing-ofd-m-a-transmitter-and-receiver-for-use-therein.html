				<td>A METHOD OF COMMUNICATION USING ORTHOGONAL<br>
FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (OFDM),<br>
A TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER FOR USE THEREIN<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of communication using orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), a transmitter and receiver for use therein and,<br>
more particularly, to channel estimation and tracking in [OFD] communication<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
OFDM communication has been chosen for most of the modern high-data<br>
rate communication systems (Digital Audio Broadcast - DAB, Terrestrial Digital<br>
Video Broadcast - DVB-T, and Broadband Radio Access Networks - BRAN such<br>
as HIPERLAN/2, IEEE802.11a, for example). However, in most cases the receiver<br>
needs an accurate estimate of the channel impulse response.<br>
In many known OFDM systems, each OFDM symbol of size NN+ is<br>
preceded by a guard interval that is longer than the channel impulse response<br>
(CIR) and a cyclic prefix of D N+ samples is inserted as the guard interval at the<br>
transmitter, the prefix consisting of D samples circularly replicated from the useful<br>
OFDM symbol time domain samples. The cyclic prefix enables very simple<br>
equalisation at the receiver, where the cyclic prefix is discarded and each<br>
truncated block is processed, for example using Fourier Transform (usually Fast<br>
Fourier Transform), to convert the frequency-selective channel output into N<br>
parallel flat-faded independent sub-channel outputs, each corresponding to a<br>
respective sub-carrier. For equalisation purposes, numerous strategies exist.<br>
Following the zero forcing approach, for example, each sub-channel output is,<br>
unless it is zero, divided by the estimated channel coefficient of the corresponding<br>
sub-carrier.<br>
Like other digital communication systems, OFDM modulation encounters<br>
problems at high Doppler spreads, which occur notably when the user is moving<br><br>
fast, for example in a car. HIPERLAN/2, for example, was designed to work only<br>
up to speeds of 3 m/s ("pedestrian speed"). Accordingly, the channel impulse<br>
response needs to be constantly tracked and updated, especially in the presence<br>
of high Doppler spreads.<br>
In a known OFDM communication system pilot tones are added which may<br>
change their position from one OFDM symbol to another. The amplitudes and<br>
positions of the pilot tones are known to the receiver. The receiver uses the pilot<br>
tones to estimate the channel coefficients of the corresponding carriers. This<br>
method is widely used, but it degrades the system performance, since a certain<br>
number of carriers cannot be used for data, since they are reserved for the pilot<br>
tones.<br>
It is also known to add learning sequences (See for example EBU Review<br>
Technical No. 224, August 1987, "Principles of modulation and channel coding for<br>
digital broadcasting for mobile receiver", by M. Alard and R. Lassalle.). In<br>
HIPERLAN/2, for example, there are at least 2 learning OFDM symbols per frame<br>
(i.e. 2 OFDM symbols of 2 • 4/us duration in total per 2ms). If the channel changes<br>
quickly, there must be many more training sequences and the consequence is an<br>
even bigger degradation in the system performance.<br>
Many of the known systems are unable to decode all carriers of OFDM<br>
symbols in the presence of channel nulls. Recent innovations propose ways for<br>
decoding OFDM symbols even in the presence of channel nulls (see for example<br>
the publication entitled "Reduced Complexity Equalizers for Zero-Padded OFDM<br>
transmissions" by B. Muquet, Marc de Courville, G. B. Giannakis, Z. Wang, P.<br>
Duhamel in the proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics Speech<br>
and Signal Processing ('ICASSP') 2000 and the publication entitled "OFDM with<br>
trailing zeros versus OFDM with cyclic prefix: links, comparisons and application to<br>
the HiperLAN/2 system" by Muquet, B.; de Courville, M.; Dunamel, P.; Giannakis,<br>
G. in the proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Communications,<br>
2000, Volume: 2. However, these publications do not offer responses to the<br>
problems referred to above concerning channel estimation and channel tracking.<br>
Ideally, the OFDM modulation system would keep all the advantages of<br>
classic OFDM and additionally allow very simple and completely blind channel<br><br>
estimation at the receiver. No additional redundancy would be added to the<br>
system and therefore no bandwidth would be lost. Such a system would be<br>
advantageous in low-mobility scenarios and would make OFDM systems<br>
applicable to high-mobility scenarios as well.<br>
Many of the examples and illustrations presented below are based on the<br>
assumption N = 4 • D, that is to say that the size of the prefix (0 samples) is<br>
assumed to be one quarter of the size of the useful OFDM symbol (N samples).<br>
This corresponds to the case of HiperLAN/2 or IEEE802.11. This restriction is<br>
introduced for sake of simplicity only. It will be appreciated that the examples and<br>
illustrations are applicable more generally to the case of NN+, D N+, the<br>
necessary adaptation being basically straightforward.<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows an OFDM communication system in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the invention comprising a transmitter comprising an OFDM<br>
modulator 1 and a receiver comprising an OFDM demodulator 2, the transmitter<br>
and the receiver communicating over a communication channel 3.<br>
An input bit-stream   is modulated onto a set of N<br>
carriers whose carrier amplitudes are given by the vector<br>
  , corresponding to OFDM symbol number k.<br>
Afterwards, the time domain OFDM signal is generated by means 4 which<br>
performs an Inverse Fourier Transform operation, or preferably an Inverse Fast<br>
Fourier Transform ('IFFT) operation where (.)r<br>
is the transposition operator and (•)* is the complex conjugate operator:<br><br><br><br>
The resulting parallel signal x (k) vector is converted to a series signal by a<br>
parallel-to-series converter 5, a prefix, represented by the Dxl vector<br>
  being inserted into the signal as guard interval between each<br>
OFDM symbol to produce a series digital signal xn. The series digital signal xn is<br>
then converted to an analogue signal x(t) by a digital-to-analogue converter 6 and<br>
transmitted over the channel 3.<br>
The channel 3 has a Channel Impulse Response H(k) = C(k) and also<br>
introduces noise v.<br>
At the receiver 2, an analogue signal r(t) is received and converted to a<br>
digital signal rn by an analogue-to-digital converter 7. The digital signal rn is then<br>
converted to a parallel signal by a series-to-parallel converter r(k) and equalised<br>
and demodulated by equalisation and demodulation means 9 to produce<br>
demodulated signals s"'(k). In the following analysis, consideration of noise is<br>
omitted for the sake for simplicity. However, including the consideration of noise<br>
does not significantly modify the results.<br>
In some known OFDM communication systems, the guard interval is used to<br>
add some redundancy (D samples of redundancy are added) by introducing a<br>
cyclic prefix, for example in the following manner:<br><br>
In other words, data from the end of the frame is repeated by the transmitter in the<br>
guard interval to produce a prefix.<br>
In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, however, the<br>
prefix samples inserted as guard interval of OFDM symbol number k, ak.c0 to ak.Co-<br>
1, are deterministic and are known to said receiver as well as to said transmitter.<br>
The prefixes comprise a vector  that is common to the<br>
symbols multiplied by at least one weighting factor ak, so that the prefixes have the<br>
overall form The weighting factor ak may be constant from one<br><br>
symbol to another. However, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
weighting factor ak differs from one symbol to another, the elements of a given<br>
vector PD being multiplied by the same weighting factor. With an OFDM modulator<br>
in the transmitter functioning in this way, blind channel estimation in the receiver<br>
can be done simply and at low arithmetical complexity. In particular, the receiver<br>
can constantly estimate and track the channel impulse response without any loss<br>
of data bandwidth. Moreover, the demodulator at the receiver can have<br>
advantageous characteristics, ranging from very low arithmetical cost (at medium<br>
performance) to high arithmetical cost (very good system performance).<br>
More particularly, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the prefix of<br>
D samples that is added in the guard interval comprises a pre-calculated suitable<br>
vector  of D samples that is independent of the data and that is<br>
weighted by a pseudo-random factor ak that only depends on the number k of the<br>
latest OFDM symbol:<br><br>
For the purposes of the analysis below, a second prefix/OFDM symbol vector<br>
is defined as follows:<br><br>
Several choices for are possible. It is possible to choose that is to<br>
say that can be of any complex value. However, any ■ leads to<br>
performance degradation compared to preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
It is possible to limit the choice of ak, somewhat less generally to with<br>
  This choice usually leads to good system performance, but the decoding<br>
process risks to be unnecessarily complex.<br>
Accordingly, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the phase<br>
of ak is chosen so that where m is an integer, N is the useful OFDM<br>
symbol size and D is the size of the pseudo-random prefix. This choice is<br><br>
particularly advantageous when using the specific decoding methods described<br>
below.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, the following analysis assumes that the weighting<br>
factor has been chosen as m integer. However, it will be appreciated<br>
that the mathematical adaptation to any of the cases presented above is<br>
straightforward.<br>
It proves to be very useful to choose ak such that its phase changes from<br>
OFDM symbol to OFDM symbol. The constant prefix PD is preferably chosen with<br>
respect to certain criteria, for example the following:<br>
•	In the frequency domain, PD is as flat as possible over the frequency<br>
band used for data carriers.<br>
•	In the frequency domain, PD is as near to zero as possible for all<br>
unused parts of the band.<br>
•	In the time domain, PD has a low peak-to-average-power-ratio<br>
(PAPR).<br>
•	The length of PD is the size of the OFDM guard interval, that is to say<br>
D samples. Alternatively, a shorter sequence of length D 
chosen where D-D zeros are appended.<br>
With these criteria, without any complication of the transmitter, the receiver is<br>
able to estimate the channel impulse response blindly, track the changes of the<br>
channel impulse response blindly and perform an arithmetically simple<br>
equalization.<br>
An example of a frame of OFDM symbols in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 2. The operation of the system<br>
will first be described for the specific case where. ak is constant and equal to 1.<br>
Now, the modulation unit of the transmitter is clearly defined. In the following,<br>
the operations to be performed in the receiver are considered. Each received<br>
OFDM symbol selected at the input of the demodulator 9 can then be expressed<br>
as follows (neglecting additive noise):<br><br><br>
where the channel impulse response of the demodulator 9 is assumed to be<br>
  is the contribution of the demodulator 9 channel matrix<br>
corresponding to inter-block-interference and  is its contribution to inter-<br>
symbol-interference.<br>
The components of the received signal corresponding to inter-block-<br>
interference   are illustrated in Figure 3, where blank elements<br>
correspond to zero values, for an example where N = 4-D (for example, in the<br>
case of HiperLAN/2 or IEEE802.11, N = 64 and D = 16). It will be seen that [HIBI]<br>
is a matrix of size (N+D)x(N+D) with a triangular sub-matrix of size (D-1)x(D-<br>
1) at its upper right-hand corner, illustrated by Figure 7, the other elements of the<br>
matrix being zero.<br>
The components of the received signal corresponding to inter-symbol-<br>
interference are illustrated in Figure 4, for the same case and in the<br>
same manner as Figure 3. It will be seen that   is a matrix of size<br>
  with triangular sub-matrices on its major diagonal as illustrated<br>
by Figure 7 and triangular sub-matrices   of size DxD on the diagonal<br>
immediately below the main diagonal as illustrated by Figure 8, the other elements<br>
of the matrix being zero.<br>
The channel impulse response seen by demodulator 9 is represented by the<br>
sum of the inter-block-interference and the inter-symbol-interference <br>
as shown in Figure 5. The resulting signal for this example is shown in Figure 9,<br>
where are successive parts of the OFDM symbol #k containing as<br>
well contributions of the preceding and following prefix convolved by the channel,<br>
  are corresponding parts of size D of the useful signal transmitted<br>
and  is a corresponding part of size D of the following prefix in this example.<br>
Of course, the example may be generalised to any <br>
The expectation values of the parts of the received signals are as follows:<br><br><br>
It will be appreciated that the expectation values of the useful parts x0(k) to<br>
x3(k) of the OFDM symbol tend to zero over a large number of symbols since they<br>
are quasi-random with zero mean. However, the prefix PD is known to the receiver<br>
(and in this embodiment is constant over successive symbols) and enables<br>
  to be estimated, by approximating the expectation values E0 and<br>
E4 over a large number R of symbols:<br><br>
The sum of the expectation values E0 and E4 is then given by:<br><br>
A first embodiment of a method of channel impulse response estimation on D<br>
symbols in accordance with the present invention utilises the expression of the<br>
above equation as follows:<br><br><br>
where the matrices   are the (Fast) Fourier<br>
Transform and Inverse (Fast) Fourier	Transform matrices respectively and the<br>
prefix PD is of size D. The matrices are illustrated by Figure 7,<br>
Figure 8 and Figure 6 respectively.<br>
Accordingly, in this first method, the channel impulse response is estimated<br>
using the following steps:<br><br>
• Perform a component-by-component division of the first result by the<br><br>
The resulting channel estimation is hD of size Dxl. This method works well<br>
in many circumstances and has a low arithmetic cost, since its calculations are<br>
based on matrices of size DxD. However, an OFDM symbol which usually is of<br>
size N&gt;D samples will be equalized based on this estimation. Thus, this method<br>
works very well if the prefix-spectrum is non-zero everywhere in the FFTDXD<br>
domain (and, of course, everywhere well above channel noise). This can be a<br>
troublesome limitation in other circumstances.<br>
A second embodiment of a method of channel impulse response estimation<br>
on D carriers in accordance with the present invention avoids this limitation, at the<br>
expense of increased arithmetic cost. This second method does not estimate hD<br>
based on a de-convolution in the FFTDXD domain as presented above, but<br>
estimates  directly based on the received vector<br><br><br><br>
This equation is represented in more detail in Figure 10. In this second<br>
method, the channel impulse response is estimated using the following steps:<br><br>
The last step of the list presented above is not essential for the basic<br>
equalization algorithm but may be useful, for example in algorithms used to reduce<br>
noise levels.<br>
The above methods have been described with reference to the specific case<br>
where ak is constant and equal to 1. In preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
however, the weight ak of the prefix to each symbol k is a preferably complex<br>
pseudo-random factor that only depends on the number k of the latest OFDM<br>
symbol. The adaptations to this method of the basic equations (shown in Figure 9)<br>
are shown in Figure 11.<br>
It is found that equations 4 and 8 are to be adapted as follows:<br><br>
The procedures for blind channel estimation described above remain<br>
applicable by setting  This amounts to weighting the<br>
preceding and following D prefix-samples of each received symbol by the<br>
corresponding respectively.<br>
The values of the prefixes   are chosen as a function of selected<br>
criteria, as mentioned above. Values that have been found to give good results<br>
with the criteria:<br><br>
•	Low Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio of the time domain signal<br>
•	Low Out-of-Band Radiation, that is to say maximise the energy of the prefix<br>
over the useful band and not waste prefix energy over null carriers<br><br>
•	Spectral Flatness, e.g. SNR of each channel estimates shall be approx.<br>
constant<br>
•	Low-Complexity Channel Estimation, i.e. by prefix spectrum whose spectral<br>
contributions are mainly just phases (i.e. of constant modulus),<br>
are shown in Figure 12 by way of example, for the following OFDM parameters:<br>
•	Size of the Prefix in Time Domain: 0=16 Samples<br>
•	Size of the OFDM symbols in the frame: W=64 Samples<br>
•	Carriers where channel coefficients are to be estimated (over N+D=80<br>
carriers): Carriers 1 to 52<br>
•	Out-of-Band region: Carriers 76 to 80<br>
•	Maximum PAPR has not been limited<br>
•	Out-of-Band Radiation as low as possible<br>
•	Spectral Flatness as good as possible.<br>
The channel estimation is done by calculating the expectation value over a<br>
number of samples of the received vector as explained above. If the tracking of the<br>
channel is done based on a first estimation of the channel<br>
impulse response and a number R of OFDM symbols, the first estimate is then<br>
updated as follows:<br><br>
based on the ideas of the first method for channel estimation that has been<br>
presented above. Alternatively, the second method can be applied by<br><br><br>
where the factors  are positive real numbers that are used for<br>
normalization and weighting of the different contributions. Thus, for example it is<br>
possible to take older OFDM symbols less into account for the channel estimation<br>
than later ones. The Fourier matrix [F] can be chosen in the N+D carriers or D<br>
carriers domain<br>
Several equalization methods are advantageous using the pseudo-random<br>
prefix OFDM. In general, the different methods offer different performance-<br>
complexity trade-offs.<br>
A first embodiment of a method of equalization uses zero forcing in the N+D<br>
Domain and offers low complexity equalization.<br>
With  the Channel Impulse Response matrix can be represented<br>
as follows:<br><br>
Still assuming that the length of the channel impulse response is D, the<br>
coefficients  are set to zero. This is a so-called pseudo-circulant<br>
matrix, corresponding to the case where  is not equal to 1, and can be<br>
diagonalized as follows:<br><br><br>
With the assumption that and that the weighting factor<br>
has been chosen as , where m is an integer, and if the received<br>
vector R(k) is:<br><br>
the procedure of this method of zero forcing equalisation is:<br>
•	Perform Multiplication <br><br>
•	Calculate the frequency shifted, estimated CIR coefficients<br><br>
•	Extract the N equalized samples of the kih OFDM-data symbol to SEQ(k).<br>
•	Transform the kth OFDM data symbol. into the frequency domain by<br>
a Fourier transform <br>
•	Proceed with metric calculation, etc. on the received equalised carriers.<br>
Another embodiment of a method of equalization uses a method known from<br>
studies on zero padding. The received vector R(k) in the OFDM Pseudo Random<br>
Prefix Scheme can be expressed as follows, where [P] contains a (N+D)xN pre-<br>
coding matrix and IN is the NxN identity matrix:<br><br>
The Channel Impulse Response estimation obtained as described above is<br>
then used together with the known values of PD to perform the following operation<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br><br>
in which the known prefix values are multiplied by the Channel Impulse Response<br>
estimation and the result subtracted from the received signal. In the general case,<br>
[H\ is a pseudo circulant channel matrix. So, the diagonalisation of such matrices<br>
can then be performed in order to calculate [H]PD efficiently. Then, several<br>
equalization approaches are possible, for example the Zero Forcing (ZF) approach<br>
or the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalization approach. Examples of<br>
MMSE equalization methods are described in the articles "OFDM with trailing<br>
zeros versus OFDM with cyclic prefix: links, comparisons and application to the<br>
HiperLAN/2 system" by Muquet, B.; de Courville, M.; Dunamel, P.; Giannakis, G.<br>
