				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of phenyl alkyl ketone substituted by cyclic arnine.<br>
The present invention relates to novel phenyl alkyl ketones which are substituted by cyclic amine, to a novel process for the preparation thereof, to their use for the preparation of photoinitiators for the photopolymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds, as well ,as to a photopolymerisablejcomposition comprising such photoinitiators.<br>
i<br>
EP-B-0284 561 discloses a-aminoacetophenones which are used as photoinitiators. These<br>
compounds are prepared by a series of process steps which, in the case of aromatic amines, always start from a derivative of a p-fluorophenylalkylen-1-one, the fluoro in p-posi-tion being replaced with an amino group in the final step of the synthesis. This replacement is carried out in an organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide, in the presence of potassium carbonate.<br>
One aim of the invention was, inter alia, to develop, on the one hand, reactions which avoid the use of fluoroaromates because these are ecologically problematical, require undesirable waste disposal and because, owing to their relatively high reactivity, they are susceptible to amines and, on the other hand, to get away from organic solvents because working in those results in more or less 'dark-coloured products with byproducts, i,e. in less pure products and lower yields.<br>
The processes known from the Hterature wherein, in a phenyl alkyl ketone containing halogen in p-position, the halogen in the phenyl nucleus, in particular fluoro or chloro, is replaced with an amine radical, are carried out:<br>
a) in an organic solvent (e.g. EP-B-0138754, reaction of 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-propan-1-one with piperidine in dimethylsulfoxide; CH 200 365, reaction of p-chlorostearo-phenone with dimethylamine in ethanol in the presence of copper powder as catalyst; T. Ibata, Y. isogami, J. Toyoda, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 64(1)42-49 (1991), reaction of chloroacetophenone with pyrrolidine in tetrahydrofuran using extremely high pressures (7,2 kbar); J. Org. Chem. 31(7), 2319-21 (1966), reaction of 1-(4-fluorophenyl)propan-1-one with alicyclic amines, such as piperidine, in dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide, or<br>
b)	without solvents (e.g. B. G. Kresze and H. Goetz, Chem. Berichte 90, 2161, 2174<br>
(1957)), reaction of p-bromoacetophenone with piperidine under re.flux with 19 % yields of<br>
1 -(4-piperidinophenyl)ethanone; or<br>
c)	in water (e.g.: T. Lundstedt, P. Thoren, R. Carlson, Acta Chemica Scand. B 38,1984<br>
No. 8 S. 717-719; reaction of p-chloroacetophenone with dimethylamine under pressure in<br>
water; US-A-1 946 058, reaction of p-chloroacetophenone with aqueous ammonia in water<br>
under pressure in the presence of copper oxide as catalyst; JP 78-40404, reaction of p-<br>
chloroacetophenone with mono- or dialkylamines in water under pressure and in the pre<br>
sence of copper powder as catalyst) where, on the one hand, explosions occurred and, on<br>
the other hand, the yields are less than 80 %.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that under specific conditions a reaction of p-halophenyl alkyl ketones, in particular of the corresponding p-bromo compounds and p-chloro compounds with amines, especially cyclic amines, in water proceeds very selectively and well, giving high yields.<br>
Only few of such phenyl alkyl ketones, which are substituted in p-position in the phenyl nucleus by a cyclic amine and which additionally have a free methylene group in cc-position to the keto group, are known; reference is made to, inter alia, EP-B-0 138 754 (2-methyl-1(4-piperidinophenyl)propan-1-one); CH 200365 (p-dimethylaminostearophone, where the dimethylamino radical according to the description may also be replaced with piperidine without, however, any concrete example being given); G. Kresze and H. Goetz, Chem. Berichte 90, 2161, 2174 (1957), (1-(4-piperidinophenyl)ethanone); T. Ibata, Y. Isogami, J. Toyoda, Bull. Chem. Soc. JPn. 64(1), 42-49 (1991), (1-(4-pyrrolidone)aceto-phenone);' and J. Org. Chem. 31(7), 2319-21 (1966), (1-(4-piperidinophenyl)propan-1-one).<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I<br>
Ri   and   R2   together  are   straight-chain  or  branched,   unsubstituted   or<br>
substituted C3-C20- alkylene which optionally is interrupted by one or more<br>
than one -O-, -S- or -N(R4) group,<br>

and<br>
R4 is hydrogen, straight-chain or branched Ci-Csalkyl, straight-chain or<br>
branched Ca-Cs- alkenyl, Cr-Cgphenylalkyl, Ci-C4hydroxyalkyl or phenyl,<br>

in water, wherein the temperature is in the range from about 140°C-240°C,<br>
in which formulae X is a halogen atom and Ri, R2 and Ra are as defined for formula I.<br>
The invention, and at the same time the solution to the given problem, relates to novel phenyl alkyl ketones substituted by cyclic amine in p-position, which may be used, inter alia, as novel intermediates for the preparation of specific photoinitiators, as well as to a novel process for the preparation of these intermediates.<br>

unsubstituted tetramethylene, R3 is unsubstituted C6alkyl.<br>
If Ri and R2 together are a C3-C20alkylene radical, said radical is, owing to the linking N-atom, a heterocyclic ring system. This N-heterocyclic ring system may be interrupted by one or more than one additional hetero atom, such as an -O-, -S- and/or -N(R4) group, and it can additionally be substituted once or several times.<br>

The preparation of the compounds of formula I is carried out by a novel process constituting another aspect to which this invention relates.<br>
This novel process for the preparation of compounds of formula I <br>
wherein:<br>
Rt and R2 together are straight-chain or branched, unsubstituted or substituted C3-C20-alkylene which may be interrupted by one or more than one -O-, -S- or -N(R4) group, R3 is straight-chain or branched, unsubstituted or substituted C2-C20alkyl, and<br>
R4 is hydrogen, straight-chain or branched Ci-C3alkyl, straight-chain or branched C3-C5-<br>
alkenyl, C7-C9phenylalkyl, CrC^ydroxyalkyl or phenyl,<br>
consists in the aminolysis of a p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II<br><br><br><br><br><br>
with a cyclic amine of formula<br><br>
in water at a temperature of at least 130°C, in which formulae X is a halogen atom and Ri, R2 and R3 are as defined for formula I.<br>
The p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II is preferably one wherein X is bromo and, preferably, chloro.<br>
The cyclic amine of formula III is preferably present in excess amount, based on the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II. This excess is preferably from about 2.5 to 20, more preferably from 2.5 to 12, molar equivalents.<br>
The water is present in an amount from about 1 to 100, preferably from 2 to 20 and, more preferably, from 2.5 to 10, molar equivalents, based on 1 molar equivalent of the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II; however, larger amounts of water are not critical either.<br>
The reaction is conventiently carried out under pressure (c. 3-30 bar) in a pressure vessel, preferably in a steel high-pressure reactor equipped with blade agitator, manometer and thermocouple. However, it is also possible to carry out the reaction without pressure vessel under reflux (c. 105°C -110°C).<br>
The temperature is conveniently in the range from about 140°C to 240°C, preferably from 150°C to 230°C. When working with the p-bromophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II, the temperature is in the range from about 140°C to 200°C, preferably from 160°C to 180°C, and when working with the p-chlorophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II, the temperature is in the range from about 180°C to 240°C, preferably from 200°C to 230°C.<br>
Catalysts may, but do not have to, be added. Altough they accelerate the reaction to a certain extent, working without catalysts reduces the ecological problems and renders the advantages of adding heavy metals less important.<br>
Suitable catalysts are in particular:<br>
copper compounds or nickel compounds or the salts thereof, typically copper(l) chloride, copper(l) bromide, copper(l) iodide, copper(ll) bromide, copper(ll) chloride, copper carbonate, copper(ll) sulfate, copper oxide as well as copper powder, or nickel acetate, nickel oxide, nickel chloride and nickel bromide.<br>
These catalysts are used in amounts from about 0.1 to 15 % by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5 % by weight, based on 100.0 % by weight of p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II.<br>
Further solvents are, in principle, not required for carrying out the reaction, but may additionally be used. Convenient solvents have been found to be high boiling and polar solvents, typically diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glydol dimethyl ether, benzyl alcohol, phenylethyl alcohol or phenoxyethanol.<br>
The reaction of the cyclic amine of formula III with the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula It is preferably carried out such that, either:<br>
a)	the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II is placed, together with the water and the<br>
cyclic amine, in the reaction vessel and is immediately heated to the final temperature, or<br>
b)	the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II, together with the water and the amine, is<br>
placed in the reaction vessel and heated slowly over hours during the reaction to the final<br>
temperature, or<br>
c) the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II is added during the reaction, preferably in fused form, to the water and the cyclic amine which have been previously heated to the reaction temperature. This process variant reduces or eliminates in particular the risk of an autocatalytic degradation at very high temperatures. The process can be carried out, for example, by placing all components in a reaction vessel and adding the p-bromophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II in the temperature range from about 140°C-190°C over hours, the temperature being slowly raised over about 3-12 hours from the lower to the higher temperature level, or by adding the p-chlorophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II in the temperature range from about 180°C-230°C over hours, the temperature being slowly raised over about 3-12 hours from the lower to the higher temperature level.<br>
For safety reasons the accumulation of the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone is expediently kept under control.<br>
A preferred process method is typically that, which comprises placing 1 part (here and hereinbelow, parts are based on mol amounts) of p-bromophenyl alkyl ketone or 1 part of p-chlorophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II, wherein R3 is straight-chain or branched, unsub-stituted C2-C7alkyl, with 5 parts of a cyclic amine of formula III, wherein Rt and R2 together are C4-C6alkylene which may be interrupted by an -O-, -S- or -N(R4) group and R4 is hydrogen or methyl, and with 5 parts of water in a reaction vessel and reacting this mixture under pressure at a temperature from about 160°C - 180°C or 200°C - 230°C, or that method, which comprises placing 10 to 20 parts of a cyclic amine of formula III, wherein Ri and R2 together are C4-C6alkylene which may be interrupted by an -O-, -S- or -N(R4) group and R4 is hydrogen or methyl, with 20 to 40 parts of water in a reaction vessel, adding 2 to 4 parts of p-chlorophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II, wherein R3 is straight-chain or branched, unsubstituted C2-C7alkyl, and reacting this mixture under pressure at about 210°C - 230°C.<br>
The processing and purification of the novel phenyl alkyl ketones of formula I, which are substituted by a cyclic amine, is carried out by known methods, typically by distillation, crystallisation and filtration.<br>
The cyclic amines of formula III are known, some being commercially available, and can be prepared in known manner (e.g. Houben-Weyl, Vol. 11/1 (1957) p. 26-29, 32-33 and 63-67;<br>
Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. 3, 307 (1955); JACS 109, 1496-1502 (1987) or Tetrahedron Vol. 40, 1433-1456(1984).<br>
Said cyclic amines are typically the following compounds: morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, piperazine, N-methylpiperazine, 2,6-dimethylmorpholine, dimethylpiperidine, dimethylpiperazine, thiomorpholine, 4-hydroxypiperidine, 3-ethoxycarbonylpiperidine or hexamethylene imine.<br>
The p-halophenyl alkyl ketones of formula II are also known (e.g. Friedel-Crafts and related Reactions, Ed. C.A, Olah, J. Wiley and Sons, N.Y. (1964) Vol. 3, Parts 1+2; Chem. Rev. 55, 229 (1955); Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. 3,14 (1955) and JACS 109,7122 (1987).<br>
Illustrative examples of single compounds are: 1-(4-bromophenyl)-n-butan-1-one, 1-(4-bromophenyl)-n-pentan-1 -one, 1 -(4-bromophenyl)-n-hexan-1 -one, 1 -(4-bromophenyl)-n-heptan-1-one, 1-(4-bromophenyl)--n-octan-1-one, 1-(4-bromophenyl)-isononan-1-one, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-n-butan-1 -one and 1 -(4-chlorophenyl)-n-pentan-1 -one.<br>
The preparation of the p-halophenyl alkyl ketones of formula II is carried out in known<br>
manner, typically by a Friedel-Crafts reaction from a halobenzene and an alkanecarboxylic<br>
acid chloride in accordance with the following reaction scheme:      <br><br><br><br><br><br>
p-halophenyl alkyl ketone<br>
X in these formulae is a halogen atom, preferably chloro or bromo, and R3 has the meaning cited above.<br>
Both educts, the halobenzene and the alkanecarboxylic acid chloride, are known.<br>
Typical examples of halobenzenes are, preferably, monobromobenzene and, in particular, monochlorobenzene.<br>
Typical examples of alkanecarboxylic acid chlorides are e.g. butyric acid chloride, isobutyric acid chloride, n-valeric acid chloride, isovaleric acid chloride, hexanoic acid chloride, enan-thic acid chloride, caprylic acid chloride, pelargonic acid chloride, capric acid chloride, lauric acid chloride, myristic acid chloride, palmitic acid chloride, stearic acid chloride, arachinic acid chloride, eicosancarboxylic acid chloride and behenic acid chloride.<br>
The p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II obtained by this reaction must be isolated prior to being further reacted with the cyclic amine of formula III.<br>
It is surprising, and was not to be foreseen on the basis of the literature mentioned at the outset, that the addition of water to the reaction of the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II with the cyclic amine of formula III very efficiently prevents the formation of coloured byproducts and resinifications, giving very pure bright products having a purity of &gt;99.0 %.<br>
Compared to processing in organic solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylforma-mide, processing in water is ecologically advantageous, especially in large scale production.<br>
It is also surprising that the reaction of the p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II with the cyclic amine of formula III, i.e. the halogen replacement in the case of a little-activated benzene derivative, proceeds so smoothly and quickly in water.<br>
It is also surprising that the aminolysis reaction proceeds without the compulsory addition of a catalyst and gives high yields of 88 % to 96 %; the absence of a catalyst furthermore saves having to remove it from the final product which usually involves a time-consuming process.<br>

The process of this invention thus permits in a simple manner, which may be very well realised in large scale production, the preparation of photoinitiators of formula IV starting from monohalobenzene and an acid chloride of formula<br>
by a Friedel Crafts reaction to a p-halophenyl alkyl ketone of formula II and the aminolysis<br>
thereof,<br>
with a cyclic amine of formula III<br>
in water at a temperature of at least 130°C, in which formulae X is a halogen atom and RI, R2 and RS are as defined above, to a cyclic amine-substituted phenyl alkyl ketone of formula<br><br><br><br>
halogenation of this phenyl alkyl ketone compound of formula I, reaction with an amine of formula<br><br>
subsequent reaction with a compound introducing R5, and Stevens rearrangement under basic conditions.<br>
The halogenation of the phenyl alkyl ketone compound of formula I is an oc-halogenation with e.g. bromo or chloro in a solvent, such as glacial acetic acid, at room temperature. The subsequent animation with an amine of formula<br>
wherein R6 and R7 are as defined above (e.g. dimethylamine) is carried out in a suitable solvent e.g. methyl ethyl ketone. After the amination, the reaction is carried out with a compound introducing the RS group, typically benzyl bromide, benzyl chloride, ally! bromide or allyl chloride with subsequent Stevens rearrangement under basic conditions, e.g. NaOH or KOH.<br>
Owing to the presence of a basic amino group, the photoinitiators of formula IV may be converted into the corresponding acid addition salts by the addition of acids. These acids can be inorganic or organic acids. Illustrative examples of such acids are HCI, HBr, H2SO4, H3PO4, mono- or polycarboxylic acids, typically acetic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, sebacic acid, tartaric acid or CF3COOH, sulfonic acids such as CH3SO3H, C^HasSOsH, p-C12H2s-C6H4-SO3H, p-CH3-C6H4-SO3H or CF3SO3H, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid and benzoic acid.<br>
Photoinitiators for radical polymerisable compounds are those compounds which break down into radical fragments when irradiated with shortwave light and which are the actual initiators for the polymerisation of the ethylenically unsaturated compounds.<br>
These photoinitiators are mainly used for the photopolymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds or mixtures comprising such compounds, for photocuring pigmented systems such as printing inks or white finishes, for photocuring non-pigmented systems, such as UV-curable printing inks, for preparing photoresists and printing plates and for exterior varnishes which postcure on the surface in daylight.<br>
The unsaturated compounds can contain one or more than one olefinic double bond and may be low molecular (monomeric) or higher molecular (oligomeric). Illustrative examples of monomers containing a double bond are alkyl acrylates or hydroxyalkyl acrylates, or alkyl methacrylates or hydroxyalkyl methacrylates, typically methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate or 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, methyl meth-<br>
acrylate or ethyl methacrylate. Further examples are acrylonitrile, acryl amide, methacryl amide, N-substituted (meth)acrylamides, vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers such as isobutyl vinyl ether, styrene, alkyl styrene, halogen styrene, N-vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride.<br>
Illustrative examples of monomers containing several double bonds are ethylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, hexamethylene glycol diacrylate or bisphenol A diacrylate, 4,4'-bis(2-acryloyloxyethoxy)diphenylpropane, trimethyl-olpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate or pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, vinyl acrylate, divinyl benzene, divinyl succinate, diallyl phthalate, triallyl phosphate, triallyl isocyanurate or tris(2-acryloyloxyethyl)isocyanurate.<br>
Illustrative examples of higher molecular (oligomeric) polyunsaturated compounds are acrylated epoxy resins, acrylated polyethers, acrylated polyurethanes or acrylated polyesters. Other examples of unsaturated oligomers are unsaturated polyester resins, which are mostly prepared from maleic acid, phthalic acid and one or more than one diol and which have a molecular weight from about 500 to 3000. Such unsaturated oligomers can also be called prepolymers.<br>
Often, two-component mixtures of a prepolymer with a polyunsaturated monomer, or three-component mixtures which additionally contain a monounsaturated monomer, are used. The prepolymer is in this case in particular decisive for the properties of the paint film and by varying it, the skilled person can influence the properties of the cured film. The polyunsaturated monomer acts as crosslinker which makes the paint film insoluble. The monounsaturated monomer acts as reactive diluent for lowering the viscosity, rendering the use of a solvent unnecessary.<br>
Such two- and three-component systems based on a prepolymer are used for printing inks as well as for paints, photoresists or other photocurable compounds. The binders used for printing inks are often also one-component systems based on photocurable prepolymers.<br>
Unsaturated polyester resins are mostly used in two-component systems together with a monounsaturated monomer, preferably styrene. For photoresists, specific one-component<br>
systems are often used, such as polymaleinimides, polychalcones or polyimides, as described in DE-OS 2 308 830.<br>
The unsaturated compounds can also be used in admixture with non-photopolymerisable film-forming components. Said components can, for example, be physically drying polymers or their solutions in organic solvents, typically nitrocellulose or cellulose acetobutyrate. However, they can also be chemically or thermally curable resins such as polyisocyanates, polyepoxides or melamine resins. The additional use of thermally curable resins is important for use in so-called hybrid systems which are photopolymerised in a first step and then crosslinked by heat aftertreatment in a second step.<br>
In addition to the photoinitiator, the photopolymerisable mixtures can also comprise different additives. Typical examples thereof are thermal inhibitors to prevent a premature polymerisation, such as hydroquinone or sterically hindered phenols. To enhance the dark storage stability it is possible to use e.g. copper compounds, phosphorus compounds, quaternary ammonium compounds or hydroxylamine derivatives. For the purpose of exluding the atmospheric oxygen during polymerisation, it is possible to add paraffin or similar wax-like substances which migrate to the surface at the beginning of the polymerisation. As light stabilisers, small amounts of UV absorbers, such as those of the benzotriazole, benzo-phenone or oxalanilide type, may be added. Even better is the addition of light stabilisers which do not absorb UV light, typically sterically hindered amines (HALS).<br>
In specific cases it may be advantageous to use mixtures of two or more photoinitiators of formula IV. It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures with known photoinitiators, typically mixtures with benzophenone, acetophenone derivatives, benzoin ethers, benzil ketals, monoacryl phosphine oxides or bisacyl phosphine oxides.<br>
To accelerate the photopolymerisation it is possible to add amines such as triethanol amine, N-methyldiethanol amine, ethyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate, Michler's ketone or bisdiethylami-nobenzophenone. The action of the amines can be enforced by adding aromatic ketones of the benzophenone type.<br>
Acceleration of the photopolymerisation can also be achieved by adding photosensitisers which shift or broaden the spectral sensitivity. Such photosensitisers are in particular<br>
aromatic carbonyl compounds such as benzophenone derivatives, thioxanthone derivatives, anthraquinone derivatives and 3-acylcoumarine derivatives and also 3-(aroylmethylene)-thiazolines.<br>
The effectivity of the photoinitiators may be enhanced by the addition of titanocene derivatives with fluororganic radicals, such as disclosed in EP-A-122 223, 186 626 and 318 894, typically in an amount of 0.1 - 20 %. Illustrative examples of such titanocenes are bis-(methylcyclopentadienyl)-bis-(2,3,6-trifluorophenyl)titanium, bis(cyclopentadienyl)-bis(4-di-butylamino-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)titanium, bis(methylcyclopentadienyl)-2-(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl titanium isocyanate, bis(cyclopentadienyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl titanium trifluoroacetate, bis(methylcyclopentadienyl)-bis(4-decyloxy-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)-titanium, bis(cyclopentadienyl)-bis-[2,6-difluoro-3-(pyrr-1-yl)phenyl]titanium, bis(methylcyclo-pentadienyl)-bis-[2,6-difluoro-3-(pyrr-1-yl)phenyl]titanium, bis(cyclopentadienyl)-bis-[2,6-difluoro-3-(2,5-dimethylpyrr-1 -yl)phenyl]titanium and bis(methylcyclopentadienyl)-bis-[2,6-difluoro-3-(2,5-dimethylpyrr-1 -yl)phenyl]titanium. Liquid a-aminoketones are particularly suitable for these mixtures.<br>
The photopolymerisable composition, comprising<br>
A)	at least one ethylenically unsaturated photopolymerisable compound, and<br>
B)	at least one photoinitiator of formula IV and,<br>
C)	optionally, further known and customary additives<br>
can be used for different purposes. Of particular importance is their use in pigmented or coloured systems, such as printing inks, for photographic reproduction processes, image recording processes and for the preparation of relief forms.<br>
Another important field of application are exterior varnishes which may be pigmented or non-pigm.ented. Particularly important are the mixtures in white finishes, which are understood to be TiO2-pigmented exterior varnishes. The pigment present in the photocurable compounds may be an inorganic pigment, typically titanium dioxide (rutile or anatase), iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, chromium yellow, chromium green, nickel titanium yellow, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, cadmium yellow, cadmium red or zinc white. The pigment may be an organic pigment, typically a monoazo pigment or bisazo pigment, or a metal complex thereof, a phthalocyanine pigment, a polycyclic pigment, typically a perylene, thioindigo, flavanthrone, quinacridone, tetrachlorisoindolinone or triphenylmethane pigment. However,<br>
the pigment may also be carbon black or a metal powder, typically aluminium powder or copper powder. The pigment can also be a mixture of two or more different pigments conventionally used to obtained specific shades.<br>
The pigment can be present in an amount from 5 to 60 % by weight, based on the total amount. In printing inks, the pigment is usually present in an amount from 10-30 %.<br>
Further fields of application are the radiation curing of photoresists, the photocrosslinking of silver-free films as well as the preparation of printing plates. Another use is that for exterior varnishes which postcure on the surface by daylight. In photoresists or reprographic films, dyes are also often used instead of pigments for colouring. These dyes may be organic dyes of a very wide variety of classes, typically azo dyes, methine dyes, anthraquinone dyes or metal complex dyes. In the concentrations used, these dyes are soluble in the respective binders. The customary concentrations are from 0.1 to 20 % by weight, preferably from 1-5 % by weight, based on the entire composition.<br>
In the cited fields of application, the photoinitiators are conveniently used in amounts from 0.1 to 20 % by weight, preferably from about 0.5 to 5 % by weight, based on the photo-polymerisable composition.<br>
Polymerisation is carried out by the known methods of photopolymerisation by irradiation with light which is rich in shortwave radiation. Suitable lights sources are, for example, medium-pressure mercury lamps, high-pressure mercury lamps and low-pressure mercury lamps, superactinic fluorescent tubes, metalhalide lamps or lasers, the emission maxima of which are in the range from 250 to 450 nm. In the case of a combination with photosen-sitisers or ferrocene derivatives it is also possible to use long-wave light or laser rays of up to 600 nm.<br>
