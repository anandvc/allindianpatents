MENTHYL LACTATE PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a high-yield process for obtaining menthyl lactate<br>
by esterification and controlled hydrolysis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Menthyl lactate (ML), an ester of menthol and lactic acid, is a<br>
physiological cooling agent widely used in flavors, oral care, and cosmetics.<br>
Recently, ML was proposed for cancer treatment or as a diagnostic agent (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. 2005/0054651). Because ML has four chiral centers,<br>
there are sixteen possible stereoisomers. The most common ML isomer, 1,<br>
derives from /-menthol and L(+)-lactic acid:<br><br>
Few synthetic routes to ML have been reported. One general approach<br>
involves asymmetric reduction of menthyl pyruvate (see, e.g., Nishiyama et al.,<br>
J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. (1976) 101 and Ojima et al., J. Pro. Chem. 42<br>
(1977) 1671. This approach uses sophisticated chiral reagents and gives ML in<br>
modest chemical and optical yields.<br>
'The simplest way to make ML is direct esterification of lactic acid with<br>
menthol. Surprisingly few details about this method are available in the<br>
literature, however. A century ago, McKenzie et al. (J. Chem. Soc. 87 (1905)<br>
1016) described the preparation of /-menthyl-c//-lactate by esterification from /-<br>
menthol and c//-lactic acid "by the hydrogen chloride method." This appears to<br>
involve bubbling hydrogen chloride gas into an ether solution containing /-<br>
menthol and an excess amount of ofMactic acid, followed by washing the ether<br>
phase with aqueous sodium carbonate and water, followed by drying,<br>
concentration, and distillation. McKenzie observed changes in optical activity<br>
l<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
when optically active menthyl or bornyl esters (including ML) were hydrolyzed<br>
with alcoholic potassium hydroxide at elevated temperature to give the<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid salts. The conditions used were not effective to<br>
minimize hydrolysis of menthyl lactate; in fact, they were designed to produce<br>
menthol and lactic acid by hydrolyzing ML.<br>
Kuhn et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,725) teach an acid-catalyzed<br>
esterification of L(+)-lactic acid and /-menthol. The recommended acids are<br>
sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, acid<br>
clays, and acidic ion-exchange resins. After a typical workup, the ML product is<br>
distilled to 97-98% purity. The reference provides few synthetic details and is<br>
silent about the yield of ML obtained.<br>
Direct esterification is also taught by L. Homer et al. (Liebigs Ann. Chem.<br>
(1979) 1232). L(+)-Lactic acid and /-menthol are esterified in the presence of<br>
chloroform and a strongly acidic ion-exchange resin. After elution with<br>
chloroform through a column of alumina and solvent removal, the residue is<br>
fractionally distilled to provide a 39% yield of ML.<br>
An improved way to make menthyl lactate is needed. A desirable<br>
process would avoid expensive reagents; instead, it would retain the<br>
convenience and simplicity of direct esterification. Ideally, the process would be<br>
simple to practice and would provide high yields of ML<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We surprisingly found that the reaction of lactic acid and menthol<br>
produces not only menthyl lactate but also significant amounts of higher lactoyl<br>
esters of ML, including menthyl lactoyl lactate (MLL) and menthyl lactoyl lactoyl<br>
lactate (MLLL). The higher lactoyl esters, although previously unknown, can<br>
comprise 25% or more of a direct esterification mixture; unfortunately, the usual<br>
distillation to obtain ML sacrifices them in a high-boiling fraction that is normally<br>
discarded.<br>
In one process of the invention, menthol and lactic acid react to produce<br>
a mixture comprising menthyl lactate and one or more higher lactoyl esters of<br>
menthyl lactate. Hydrolysis of the esterification mixture follows in the presence<br>
of aqueous base and under conditions effective to convert the higher lactoyl<br>
esters to menthyl lactate. Coincidentally, the conditions minimize hydrolysis of<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
menthyl lactate to menthol, thereby maximizing the overall yield of ML. Another<br>
process of the invention involves controlled hydrolysis of a mixture comprising<br>
higher lactoyl esters of menthyl lactate. Each process is simple to practice and<br>
provides exceptionally high yields of ML.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Menthyl lactate (ML) is produced by the direct reaction of menthol and<br>
lactic acid.<br>
Menthol suitable for use in the invention can have any desired<br>
stereochemistry. With three chiral centers, menthol has eight possible<br>
stereoisomers. A menthol sample might have several different stereoisomers<br>
present. Examples include /-menthol, c/-menthol, c//-menthol (i.e., a racemic<br>
mixture of /-menthol and (/-menthol), isomers of neomenthol, isomenthol, and<br>
neoisomenthol, and mixtures thereof. /-Menthol, d-menthol, af/-menthol, and<br>
other isomers are all commercially available. Because it provides ML having<br>
excellent physiological cooling properties, /-menthol (2) is particularly preferred.<br><br>
Lactic acid reacts with menthol to make ML. With one chiral center, lactic<br>
acid has two possible stereoisomers, L-(+)-lactic aci'd and D-(-)-lactic acid.<br>
Lactic acid is commonly supplied as a concentrated solution in water (e.g., 85+<br>
wt.% lactic acid). An example is HS-88 solution, a product of Purac, which<br>
contains about 88 wt.% of lactic acid in water. Suitable lactic acid for use herein<br>
includes L-(+)-lactic acid, D-(-)-lactic acid, the racemic mixture (i.e., DL-lactic<br>
acid), and mixtures thereof. Because it provides ML having excellent<br>
physiological cooling properties, L-(+)-lactic acid (3) is particularly preferred.<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br><br>
Direct esterification of lactic acid with menthol generally produces a<br>
mixture comprising menthyl lactate and one or more higher lactoyl esters of<br>
menthyl lactate. Although previously unknown, simply heating menthol and<br>
lactic acid together (usually in the presence of a solvent such as heptane,<br>
toluene, or the like to assist in removing water formed as a result of<br>
esterification) generates higher lactoyl esters of ML, including MLL, MLLL, and<br>
traces of even higher esters.<br><br>
How the higher lactoyl esters form is not critical. The mechanism may<br>
involve successive formation of ML, MLL, MLLL, and so on, as additional lactic<br>
acid condenses with the lower ester. Of course, other mechanisms are<br>
possible, including initial formation of lactic acid oligomers followed by<br>
condensation with menthol, a combination of the two mechanisms described<br>
above, or some other pathway.<br>
The process of the invention will benefit any direct esterification process<br>
for making ML that generates higher lactoyl esters of ML. Often, the reaction<br>
mixture contains unreacted menthol, menthenes, and/or cyclic dimers of lactic<br>
acid ("lactides") in addition to ML and the higher lactoyl esters of ML. As noted<br>
earlier, water of reaction is preferably removed to promote esterification; a<br>
hydrocarbon solvent and a Barrett or Dean-Stark trap are advantageously used.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
The esterification is performed at any convenient temperature. Generally,<br>
the esterification proceeds over a range of temperatures that depend on whether<br>
a solvent is included, and if so, the identity and boiling point of the solvent. The<br>
temperature generally increases as the reaction approaches completion. Often,<br>
the esterification proceeds at or near the reflux temperature of the reaction<br>
mixture. When heptane is the solvent, for example, the esterification proceeds<br>
within the range of about 80°C to about 130°C.<br>
Preferably, no catalyst is used to promote the esterification reaction.<br>
However, a catalyst can be included. Suitable esterification catalysts are<br>
typically acids. Suitable catalysts include, for example, sulfuric acid, acidic ion-<br>
exchange resins, p-toluenesulfonic acid, alkali metal bisulfates, or the like, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The esterified product containing ML and higher lactoyl esters can be<br>
purified, if desired, by any suitable means, including distillation, crystallization, or<br>
the like, but it is preferably used "as is" for the next step, which involves<br>
controlled hydrolysis. Gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, or other<br>
techniques are conveniently used to determine the degree of conversion of<br>
menthol to ML and higher lactoyl esters.<br>
Hydrolysis is performed in the presence of aqueous base under<br>
conditions effective to convert the higher lactoyl esters to menthyl lactate while<br>
minimizing hydrolysis of menthyl lactate to menthol. While those skilled in the<br>
art appreciate that aqueous base is a good reagent for hydrolyzing esters, the<br>
challenge is to selectively hydrolyze principally MLL, MLLL, and higher oligomers<br>
to ML without hydrolyzing ML. This is difficult because the conditions that favor<br>
hydrolysis of the higher lactoyl esters to ML should also favor hydrolysis of ML to<br>
lactic acid and menthol.<br>
Suitable bases are capable of deprotonating lactic acid. Preferably, they<br>
include alkali metal hydroxides (e.g., NaOH, KOH), alkaline earth metal<br>
hydroxides (e.g., Mg(OH)2), alkali metal carbonates (e.g., Na2CO3, K2CO3), or<br>
the like. Alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and cesium hydroxide, and alkali metal carbonates<br>
are preferred. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and<br>
potassium carbonate are readily available, inexpensive, and most preferred.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
We found that by controlling hydrolysis conditions, such as the order of<br>
addition of reagents, rate of addition, nature and concentration of base, weight<br>
ratio between base and esterification product, pH, temperature, and other<br>
factors, we could selectively hydrolyze higher lactoyl esters, minimize hydrolysis<br>
of ML, and maximize the overall yield of ML. The controlled hydrolysis<br>
conditions can vary within broad ranges. For example, hydrolysis can be<br>
controlled by slowly adding the base at lower temperature, preferably dropwise,<br>
which helps to prevent increases in base concentration and pH. However, at<br>
somewhat higher temperatures, MLL hydrolysis proceeds faster-hence<br>
consuming the base faster-so pH stays lower and the addition rate can be<br>
increased (see, e.g., Examples 4-11).<br>
A two-phase reaction mixture is desirable for regulating temperature and<br>
controlling hydrolysis, but it is not necessary. Thus, the reaction mixture<br>
preferably contains both water and an immiscible organic solvent such as<br>
heptane, toluene, or the like. Basic hydrolysis produces lactate salts, which<br>
dissolve preferentially in the aqueous phase, while the desired ML product<br>
remains in the organic phase.<br>
Typically, the pH of the reaction mixture changes during the course of<br>
controlled hydrolysis, depending on the nature of base, addition order, rate of<br>
addition, and temperature. The reaction is preferably performed under<br>
conditions that will not allow pH to exceed 14. Preferably, the pH is regulated<br>
within the range of about 9 to.about 13.5. Usually, at pH values higher than<br>
13.9, more ML than desirable is hydrolyzed to menthol.<br>
The hydrolysis reaction mixture is optionally cooled using an external cold<br>
water bath or other means. For convenience, the preferred reaction<br>
temperature range is from about 5°C to about 70°C, more preferably from about<br>
15°C to about 60°C. Usually, at temperatures greater than about 60°C,<br>
evaporation can occur, which may require additional equipment such as a<br>
condenser. At temperatures below about 15°C, some components may<br>
crystallize, which would usually require longer reaction times and stronger<br>
agitation. Nevertheless, good yields of ML can still be obtained even at<br>
temperatures significantly higher than 70°C or lower than 15°C.<br>
After the hydrolysis is reasonably complete-as conveniently shown by<br>
gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, or other suitable analytical<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
techniques-the reaction mixture is usually neutralized, washed, dried, and<br>
concentrated. The ML product can be purified by any suitable method,<br>
including, for example, distillation, crystallization, precipitation, sublimation, or a<br>
combination thereof. Distillation is preferred. A skilled person can readily adjust<br>
one or more of the hydrolysis conditions (e.g., using a lower temperature or<br>
lower pH) in the event analysis shows that too much of the ML is being<br>
converted to menthol.<br>
The invention contemplates a process which comprises hydrolyzjng a<br>
mixture comprising one or more higher lactoyl esters of menthyl lactate in the<br>
presence of aqueous base under conditions effective to convert the higher<br>
lactoyl esters to menthyl lactate while minimizing hydrolysis of menthyl lactate to<br>
menthol. Thus, menthyl lactate need not be present prior to hydrolysis; it<br>
suffices to start with a mixture containing just the higher lactoyl esters of ML.<br>
The process of the invention dramatically improves the yield of menthyl<br>
lactate obtained from direct esterification. As shown in Example 1 below, the<br>
yield of ML before hydrolysis (i.e., the GC yield) is about 68%. After distillation-<br>
even an efficient one-this will drop to 50% or less. The reported literature yield<br>
is only 39%. In contrast, when controlled hydrolysis follows, the yield of ML<br>
based on charged menthol soars to 91%, and most of the balance is unreacted<br>
menthol, which can be recovered and converted to ML.<br>
The following examples merely illustrate the invention. Those skilled in<br>
the art will recognize many variations that are within the spirit of the invention<br>
and scope of the claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of /-Menthyl Lactate<br>
by Esterification and Controlled Hydrolysis<br>
Esterification: A three-neck flask equipped with a Barrett trap, reflux<br>
condenser, thermocouple, heating mantle, and magnetic stirrer is charged with /-<br>
menthol (1440 g), L-(+)-lactic acid (2880 g of grade HS-88 from Purac, 88%<br>
lactic acid in water), and heptane (720 g). The stirred mixture is brought to<br>
reflux and water is periodically drained from the trap as it forms. The<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
temperature of the mixture increases gradually to 128PC after 32 h and after 854<br>
mL of aqueous phase has been removed. The mixture is cooled to ambient<br>
temperature and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (GC). It contains: 5.4%<br>
of unreacted menthol, 67.7% of /-menthyl L-lactate (ML), 0.6% of lactide (cyclic<br>
dimer of lactic acid), 24.6% of /-menthyl L-lactoyl-L-lactate (MLL), and 0.4% of I-<br>
menthyl L-lactoyl-L-lactoyl-L-lactate (MLLL).<br>
Controlled hydrolysis: The esterified product is diluted with water (4230<br>
g) and heptane (960 g). Aqueous sodium hydroxide (809 g of 50% NaOH) is<br>
then added dropwise over 30 min. while the mixture is stirred and cooled (cold<br>
water bath) so that the temperature does not exceed 30°C and the pH does not<br>
exceed 12.9. After the base addition, the mixture stirs for another 20 min. GC<br>
analysis shows practically complete conversion of MLL into ML. The layers are<br>
separated. The organic layer is washed with 1.5% aqueous lactic acid (1000 g)<br>
and then cohobated to remove moisture. The solvent (heptane) is stripped, and<br>
j<br>
the residue is fractionally distilled under vacuum with the following results:<br>
Fraction 1,100 g, 94.5% menthol and 2.0% of ML.<br>
Fraction 2,111 g, 46.8% menthol, 51.8% ML.<br>
Fraction 3, 1860 g, 99.5% pure ML.<br>
Yield of ML contained in all three fractions based on charged menthol:<br>
91%. Yield of purified ML based on reacted menthol: 98%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of /-Menthyl Lactate<br>
by Sulfuric Acid-Catalyzed Esterification and Controlled Hydrolysis<br>
Esterification: The procedure of Example 1 is generally followed using<br>
1000 g of /-menthol, 1000 g of L-(+)-lactic acid, 500 g of heptane, and 6 g of<br>
concentrated sulfuric acid. The temperature of the mixture increases gradually<br>
to 119°C after 2 h and after 300 mL of aqueous phase has been removed. The<br>
mixture is cooled and analyzed by GC. It contains: 6.4% of unreacted menthol,<br>
57.6% of ML, 0.4% of lactide, 32.2% of MLL, and 1.9% of MLLL.<br>
Controlled hydrolysis: The esterified product is diluted with water (800 g)<br>
and heptane (500 mL). Aqueous sodium hydroxide (204 g of 50% NaOH) is<br>
then added dropwise over 70 min. while the mixture is stirred and cooled (cold<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
water bath) so that the temperature does not exceed 30°C and the pH does not<br>
exceed 13.1. The layers are separated. The organic layer is diluted with water<br>
(1350 g) and treated with more 50% aq. sodium hydroxide (150 g), which is<br>
added dropwise over 1 h in the manner described above. After the base<br>
addition, the mixture stirs for about 1 h. GC analysis shows practically complete<br>
conversion of MLL into ML. The layers are separated. The organic layer is<br>
washed with water.<br>
The entire procedure of esterification and controlled hydrolysis is<br>
repeated. The washed organic layers are combined, the solvent (heptane) is<br>
stripped, and the residue is fractionally distilled under vacuum with the following<br>
results:<br>
Fraction 1, 203 g, 87.1% menthol, 3.5% ML, and 6.2% menthenes.<br>
Fraction 2, 96.8 g, 57.2% menthol, 41.6% ML.<br>
Fraction 3, 2356 g, 99.4% pure ML.<br>
Yield of ML contained in all three fractions based on charged menthol:<br>
81%. Yield of purified ML based on reacted menthol: 91%.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of /-Menthyl Lactate<br>
by Sodium Bisulfate-Catalyzed Esterification<br>
The esterification procedure of Example 1 is generally followed using<br>
1000 g of /-menthol, 2000 g of L-(+)-lactic acid, 500 g of heptane, and 10 g of<br>
crystalline NaHSO4-H2O. The reflux starts at about 93°C and finishes at about<br>
123°C after about 581 g of the water is drained, which takes slightly under 17 h.<br>
Composition of the mixture (%, GC): menthol 3.3%, ML 48.7%, lactide 4.8%,<br>
MLL 36.5%, MLLL 5.6%. The mixture is then used in the hydrolysis experiments<br>
described below.<br>
EXAMPLES 4-11<br>
Controlled Hydrolysis: Normal Mode of Addition<br>
These examples illustrate that desirable results are obtained by addition<br>
of the aqueous base to the esterification mixture at various temperatures at pH<br>
below 14.<br>
General procedure. In a 500-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer,<br>
thermocouple, and pH probe, crude ML (88.7 g, obtained as described above in<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
Example 3) is mixed with water (89 g) and heptane (20 g). The mixture is<br>
brought to the test temperature using a thermostat. While stirring, 50% aq.<br>
NaOH (35.5 g) is then pumped gradually (0.6-3.6 hours) into the thermostatted<br>
flask, and pH is recorded periodically. After base addition, the mixture is<br>
agitated for several minutes until the GC peak corresponding to MLL drops<br>
below 1%. Results appear in Table 1.<br><br>

These examples illustrate that less desirable results are obtained when<br>
the esterification mixture is added to the aqueous base (i.e., reverse addition),<br>
with pH reaching or exceeding 14.<br>
General procedure. Aqueous NaOH (35.5 g of 50% solution) is charged<br>
to a 500-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, thermocouple, and pH probe.<br>
The stirred mixture is brought to the test temperature using a thermostat. In a<br>
separate flask, crude ML (88.7 g, obtained as described in Example 3) is mixed<br>
with water (89 g) and heptane (20 g). The stirred mixture is pumped over 0.6-<br>

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 18<br>
This example illustrates that too much aqueous base gives a less<br>
desirable result even with normal addition.<br>
The procedure of Example 7 is followed, except that 50 g of aqueous<br>
50% NaOH is used instead of 35.5 g. The composition of the reaction mixture<br>
(be) is as follows: 44.81% of /-menthol, 55.05% ML, and 0.14% of MLL.<br>
The preceding examples are meant only as illustrations. The following<br>
claims define the invention.<br>
li<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A process which comprises:<br>
(a)	reacting menthol and lactic acid to produce a mixture comprising<br>
menthyl lactate and one or more higher lactoyl esters of menthyl lactate; and<br>
(b)	hydrolyzing the mixture in the presence of aqueous base under<br>
conditions effective to convert the higher lactoyl esters to menthyl lactate while<br>
minimizing hydrolysis of menthyl lactate to menthol.<br><br>
2.	The process of claim 1 wherein the hydrolysis step is performed at a<br>
pH less than 14.<br>
3.	The process of claim 1 wherein the hydrolysis step is performed at a<br>
temperature within the range of about 5°C to about 70°C.<br><br>
4.	The process of claim 1 wherein the menthyl lactate obtained from<br>
hydrolysis is purified by distillation, crystallization, precipitation, sublimation, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
5.	The process of claim 1 wherein the higher lactoyl esters comprise<br>
menthyl lactoyl lactate (MLL) and menthyl lactoyl lactoyl lactate (MLLL).<br><br>
6.	A process which comprises hydrolyzing a mixture comprising one or<br>
more higher lactoyl esters of menthyl lactate in the presence of aqueous base<br>
under conditions effective to convert the higher lactoyl esters to menthyl lactate<br>
while minimizing hydrolysis of menthyl lactate to menthol.<br>
7.	The process of claim 6 performed at a pH less than 14.<br>
8.	The process of claim 6 performed at a temperature from about 5°C to<br>
about70°C.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2007/044146	PCT/US2006/033514<br>
9.	The process of claim 6 wherein the menthyl lactate obtained from<br>
hydrolysis is purified by distillation, crystallization, precipitation, sublimation, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
10.	The process of claim 6 wherein the higher lactoyl esters comprise<br>
MLL and MLLL<br>
13<br><br>
A simple, high-yield process for making menthyl lactate (ML) is disclosed. Menthol and lactic acid react to produce<br>
a mixture comprising menthyl lactate and one or more higher lactoyl esters of ML. Hydrolysis of the esterification mixture follows<br>
in the presence of aqueous base under conditions effective to convert the higher lactoyl esters to menthyl lactate. Coincidentally, the<br>
conditions minimize hydrolysis of menthyl lactate to menthol, thereby maximizing the overall yield of ML.</td>
