ANTIARRHYTHMIC PRECURSOR COMPOUNDS, METHODS<br>
OF SYNTHESIS AND METHODS OF USE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a disease affecting approximately 2% of the<br>
population of the United States (Sami, M.H. [1991] J. Clin. Pharmacol. 31:1081).<br>
Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CHF, the prognosis remains poor<br>
with a 5-year mortality rate higher than 50% from the time of diagnosis (McFate<br>
Smith, W. [1985] Am. J. Cardiol. 55:3A; McKee, P.A., W.P. Castelli, P.M.<br>
McNamara, W.B. Kannel [1971] N. Engl. J. Med. 285:1441). In patients with CHF,<br>
the rate of survival is lowest in those patients with severe depression of left<br>
ventricular function and patients who have frequent ventricular arrhythmias. Patients<br>
with ventricular arrhythmias and ischemic cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of<br>
sudden death. The presence of ventricular tachycardia in patients with severe CHF<br>
results in a three-fold increase in sudden death compared to those without tachycardia<br>
(Bigger, J.T., Jr. [1987] Circulation 75(suppl.IV):28). Because of the high prevalence<br>
of sudden unexpected death in patients with CHF, there has been a growing interest in<br>
the prognostic significance of arrhythmias in these patients.<br>
Several compounds have been used in the management of cardiac arrhythmias<br>
in. patients with congestive heart failure. Unfortunately, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy<br>
has been disappointing. The efficacy of anti-arrhythmic drugs markedly decreases as<br>
left ventricular function declines, such that only a small fraction of patients with CHF<br>
are responsive to anti-arrhythmic therapy. No anti-arrhythmic drug has prevented<br>
sudden death in patients with CHF and there is even a question of increased mortality<br>
associated with certain anti-arrhythmic drugs (the CAST investigators [1989] N. Engl.<br>
J. Med. 321:406).<br>
Scientists define tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation as being of multiple<br>
nature. It now seems clear, and is accepted in the art, that re-entry is the underlying<br>
mechanism to most sustained arrhythmias. Prolonging ventricular repolarization as a<br>
means of preventing ventricular arrhythmias has consequently received renewed<br>
attention. This points to Class-Ill agents as drugs of choice in the treatment of<br>
arrhythmias. A Class-Ill agent, as referred to herein, is an agent that is classified as<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
such in the Vaughan-Williams classification of anti-arrhythmic drugs. A Class-HI<br>
agent exerts its primary anti-arrhythmic activity by prolonging cardiac action potential<br>
duration (APD), and thereby the effective refractory period (ERP), with no effect on<br>
conduction. These electrophysiological changes, which are brought about by<br>
blockade of cardiac potassium channels, are well known in the art. Because the<br>
blockade of cardiac potassium channels is not associated with depression of the<br>
contractile function of the heart, Class-Ill agents are particularly attractive for use in<br>
patients with CHF. Unfortunately, the existing Class-Ill agents are limited in their<br>
utility by additional pharmacological activities, lack of good oral bioavailability, or a<br>
poor toxicity profile. Two Class III agents currently marketed are bretylium (i.v.<br>
only) and amiodarone (i.v. and p.o.).<br>
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic agent having vasodilator properties that<br>
may benefit patients with severe heart failure. Amiodarone has been shown to<br>
improve survival of post- myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic high-<br>
grade ventricular arrhythmias, and it proved efficacious in patients resistant to other<br>
anti-arrhythmic drugs without impairing left ventricular function. Cardioprotective<br>
agents and methods which employ amiodarone in synergistic combination with<br>
vasodilators and beta blockers have been described for use in patients with coronary<br>
insufficiency (U.S. Patent No. 5,175,187). Amiodarone has also been described for<br>
reducing arrhythmias associated with CHF as used in combination with<br>
antihypertensive agents, e.g., (S)-1-[6-amino-2-[[hydroxy(4-<br>
phenylbutyl)phosphinyl]oxyl]-L- proline (U.S. Patent No. 4,962,095) and zofenopril<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 4,931,464). However, amiodarone is a difficult drug to manage<br>
because of its numerous side effects, some of which are serious.<br>
The most serious long-term toxicity of amiodarone derives from its kinetics of<br>
distribution and elimination. It is absorbed slowly, with a low bioavailability and<br>
relatively long half-life. These characteristics have clinically important<br>
consequences, including the necessity of giving loading doses, a delay in the<br>
achievement of full anti-arrhythmic effects, and a protracted period of elimination of<br>
the drug after its administration has been discontinued.<br>
Amiodarone can also interact negatively with numerous drugs including<br>
aprindine, digoxin, flecainide, phenytoin, procainamide, quinidine, and warfarin. It<br>
also has pharmacodynamic interactions with catecholamines, diltiazem, propranolol,<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
and quinidine, resulting in alpha- and beta-antagonism, sinus arrest and hypotension,<br>
bradycardia and sinus arrest, and torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardias,<br>
respectively. There is also evidence that amiodarone depresses vitamin K-dependent<br>
clotting factors, thereby enhancing the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.<br>
Numerous adverse effects limit the clinical applicability of amiodarone.<br>
Important side effects can occur including corneal microdeposits, hyperthyroidism,<br>
hypothyroidism, hepatic dysfunction, pulmonary alveolitis, photosensitivity,<br>
dermatitis, bluish discoloration, and peripheral neuropathy.<br>
There is no Class-III agent presently marketed that can be used safely in<br>
patients with CHF. The cardiovascular drug market is the largest in any field of drug<br>
research, and an effective and safe Class-Ill anti-arrhythmic agent useful in patients<br>
with CHF is expected to be of substantial benefit. Therefore, a drug that could<br>
successfully improve the prognosis of CHF patients, but with a safety profile much<br>
improved over that of amiodarone, would be extremely useful and desired. Various<br>
analogs of amiodarone have been previously described (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,372,783;<br>
6,362,223; 6,316,487; 6,130,240; 5,849,788; 5,440,054; and 5,364,880). The subject<br>

physiological environment; therefore, the compounds of the subject invention can be<br>
used with a lower incidence of side effects and toxicity.<br>
In certain aspects of the subject invention, methods for making therapeutic<br>
stereoisomeric compounds are provided that are useful in the treatment of cardiac<br>
arrhythmia and that contain an ester group, which is susceptible to degradation by<br>
esterases, thereby breaking down the compound and facilitating its efficient removal<br>
from the treated individual. In a preferred aspect, the therapeutic stereoisomeric<br>
compounds are metabolized by the Phase I drug detoxification system. Particularly,<br>
methods of producing and purifying such stereoisomeric compounds are taught.<br>
Methods of adding such ester moieties and of producing and purifying stereoisomers,<br>
are well known to the skilled artisan and can be readily carried out utilizing the<br>
guidance provided herein.<br>
DEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS<br>
The definitions and explanations below are for the terms as used throughout<br>
this entire document including both the specification and the claims.<br>
I. Conventions for Formulas and Definitions of Variables<br>
The chemical formulas representing various compounds or molecular<br>
fragments in the specification and claims may contain variable substituents in addition<br>
to expressly defined structural features. These variable substiruents are identified by a<br>
letter or a letter followed by a numerical sub- or superscript, for example, "Z1" or "Z1"<br>
or "R1" where "i" is an integer. These variable substiruents are either monovalent or<br>
bivalent. That is, they represent groups attached to the remainder of the molecule by<br>
one or two chemical bonds. Whether one or two bonds are present will be clear from<br>
the context to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a group Z1 could<br>
represent a bivalent variable, as in CH3-C(=Z1)H. As another example, groups R1 and<br>
Rj could represent monovalent variable substituents, as in CH3-CH2-C(Ri)(Rj)H.<br>
When chemical structures are drawn in a linear fashion, such as those above, variable<br>
substituents contained in parentheses are bonded to the atom immediately to the left<br>
of the variable substituent enclosed in parenthesis. When two or more consecutive<br>
variable substituents are enclosed in parentheses, each of the consecutive variable<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
substituents is bonded to the immediately (i.e., first) preceding atom to the left that is<br>
not enclosed in parentheses. Thus, in the formula above, both Rj and Rj are bonded to<br>
the preceding carbon atom. Also, for any molecule with an established system of<br>
carbon atom numbering, such as steroids, these carbon atoms are designated as Ci,<br>
where "i" is the integer corresponding to the carbon atom number. For example, C6<br>
represents the 6 position or carbon atom number in the steroid nucleus as traditionally<br>
designated by those skilled in the art of steroid chemistry. "Ci" may refer to the ith<br>
carbon or a moiety comprising "i" carbon atoms. Which meaning is employed will be<br>
clear to those of ordinary skill in the art in the context of the usage.<br>
Chemical structures or portions thereof drawn in a linear fashion represent<br>
atoms in a linear chain. The symbols "--" and "-" in general represents a bond<br>
between two atoms in the chain. Thus, CH3--O-CH2-CH(Ri)-CH3 and CH3-O-CH2-<br>
CH(Ri)-CH3, and combinations of "--" and "-" thereof, represent a 2-substituted-1-<br>
methoxypropane compound. Likewise, linear representations of a structure can be<br>
presented without "--" and/or "-" bonds. For instance, CH3OCH2CH(Ri)CH3 also<br>
represents a 2-substituted-1-methoxypropane compound. In a similar fashion, the<br>
symbol "=" represents a double bond, e.g., CH2=C(Ri)-O-CH3, and the symbol "s"<br>
represents a triple bond, e.g., HC≡C-CH(Ri)--CH2--CH3. Carbonyl groups are<br>
generally represented in one of four ways: CO, C(O), C(=O), or C=O either including<br>
or excluding flanking "--" bonds, with the first two representations being preferred for<br>
simplicity. Numbers immediately succeeding atoms in chemical formulas or portions<br>
thereof enumerate the number of preceding atoms or atom groups, as is standard<br>
practice in the chemical arts, whether in standard or subscript font. Thus, for<br>
example, a "C1-C8 alkyl" and a "C1-C8 alkyl" both describe an alkyl moiety of<br>
between 1 and 8 carbons in length.<br>
A rigid cyclic (ring) structure for any compounds herein defines an orientation<br>
with respect to the plane of the ring for substituents attached to each carbon atom of<br>
the rigid cyclic compound. For saturated compounds which have two substituents<br>
attached to a carbon atom which is part of a cyclic system, --C(X1)(X2)-- the two<br>
substituents may be in either an axial or equatorial position relative to the ring and<br>
may change between axial/equatorial. However, the position of the two substituents<br>
relative to the ring and each other remains fixed. While either substituent at times may<br>
lie in the plane of the ring (equatorial) rather than above or below the plane (axial),<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
one substituent is always above the other relative to the plane of the ring as drawn in a<br>
particular orientation. In chemical structural formulas depicting such compounds, a<br>
substituent (X1) which is "below" another substituent (X2) will be identified as being<br>
in the alpha (a) configuration and is identified in text by a broken, dashed or dotted<br>
line attachment to the carbon atom, i.e., by the symbol "- - - " or ". . . ". The<br>
corresponding substituent attached "above" (X2) the other (X1) is identified in text as<br>
being in the beta (P) configuration and is indicated by an unbroken line attachment to<br>
the carbon atom. An example of X1 being "below" X2 is as follows: if X1 is<br>
positioned equatorially, X2 is positioned axially, "up" from the plane of the ring, out<br>
of the plane of the paper and toward the viewer of a 2-dimensional representation of<br>
the structure. An alternate example is when X2 is positioned equatorially, X2 is<br>
positioned axially, "down" from the plane of the ring, into the plane of the paper and<br>
away from the viewer of a 2-dimensional representation of the structure.<br>
When a variable substituent is bivalent, the valences may be taken together or<br>
separately or both in the definition of the variable. For example, a variable Ri attached<br>
to a carbon atom as -C(=Ri)- might be bivalent and be defined as oxo or keto (thus<br>
forming a carbonyl group (-CO-) or as two separately attached monovalent variable<br>
substituents α-Ri-j and β-Ri-k, where "i" identifies the particular R group and "j" and<br>
"k" identifies the particular Ri. When a bivalent variable, Ri, is defined to consist of<br>
two monovalent variable substituents, the convention used to define the monovalent<br>
variables is of the form "α-Ri-j and β-Ri-k" or some variant thereof. In such a case both<br>
α-Ri-j and β-Ri-k are attached to the carbon atom to give -C(α-Ri-j)(β-Ri-k)-. For<br>
example, when the bivalent variable R6, -C(=R6)-, is defined to consist of two<br>
monovalent variable substituents, the two monovalent variable substituents are α-R6-<br>
1:β-R6-2, giving -C(α-R6-1)(β-R6-2)-. Likewise, for the bivalent variable R11, -C(=R11)-<br>
-, two monovalent variable substituents are α-R11-1:β-R11-2. For a ring substituent for<br>
which separate a and β orientations do not exist (e.g. due to the presence of a carbon-<br>
carbon double bond in the ring), and for a substituent bonded to a carbon atom which<br>
is not part of a ring the above convention is still used, but the α and β designations are<br>
omitted.<br>
Just as a bivalent variable may be defined as two separate monovalent variable<br>
substituents, two separate monovalent variable substituents may be defined to<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
together form a bivalent variable. For example, in the formula -C1(Ri)H-C2(Rj)H- (C1<br>
and C2 define arbitrarily a first and second carbon atom, respectively), Ri and Rj may<br>
be defined to together form (1) a second bond between C1 and C2 or (2) a bivalent<br>
group such as oxa (-O-) and the formula thereby describes an epoxide.<br>
The carbon atom content of variable substituents is indicated as follows: the<br>
carbon atom content of only each portion of the definition is indicated separately by<br>
enclosing the "Ci-Cj" designation in parentheses and placing it before the portion of<br>
the definition being defined. By this first convention, C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl describes<br>
a group CH3-(CH2)n-O-CO- where n is one, two or three. Similarly while both C2-C6<br>
alkoxyalkyl and (C1-C3)alkoxy(C1-C3)alkyl define alkoxyalkyl groups containing<br>
from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, the two definitions differ since the former definition allows<br>
either the alkoxy or alkyl portion alone to contain 4 or 5 carbon atoms while the latter<br>
definition limits either of these groups to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
Where mandatory heteroatoms (via a "hetero" recitation without parentheses)<br>
or optional heteroatoms are introduced (via a "hetero" recitation inside parentheses,<br>
e.g., "(hetero)"), the numbering preferentially reflects the replacement of an existing<br>
carbon atom in the moiety with a heteroatom. Thus, while a general "C6 alkyl"<br>
recitation comprises straight, branched and cyclic alkyl radicals with six carbons, a<br>
"C6 heteroalkyl" recitation (or "C6 (hetero)alkyl" in which a heteroatom is included)<br>
contains, in this example, five carbons, one having been replaced by a heteroatom.<br>
It is to be understood that "a" as used herein includes both the singular and<br>
plural.<br>

Tautomer refers to one of two or more structural isomers that exist in<br>
equilibrium and are readily converted from one isomeric form to another. Of the<br>
various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed; keto-enol<br>
and ring-chain tautomerism. In keto-enol tautomerism, a simultaneous shift of<br>
electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. In ring-chain tautomerism, an aldehyde group<br>
in a sugar chain molecule reacting with one of the hydroxy groups in the same<br>
molecule to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form. As one example, where R2 of<br>

In the most preferred aspect, the compounds of Formula 5 are administered as the free<br>

As used herein, the terms "treatment" and "treating" encompass prophylactic<br>
administration of the compound or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the<br>
compound ("prophylaxis") as well as remedial therapy to reduce, inhibit, or eliminate<br>
a disease or disorder mentioned herein. Prophylactic administration is intended for<br>
prevention of disorders in a subject that is at risk of having or suffering from one or<br>
more disorders mentioned herein. Thus, as used herein, the term "treatment", or a<br>
derivative thereof, contemplates partial or complete inhibition of the stated disease<br>
state, when an active ingredient of the invention is administered prophylactically or<br>
following the onset of the disease state for which such active ingredient of the is<br>
administered. "Prophylaxis" refers to administration of the active ingredient(s) to a<br>
mammal to protect the mammal from any of the disorders set forth herein, as well as<br>
others.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount necessary to<br>
achieve a derived therapeutic effect such as a reduction or elimination of arrhythmic<br>
events or the severity or longevity thereof.<br>
A "mammal" may be, for example, a mouse, rat, pig, horse, rabbit, goat, cow,<br>
cat, dog, or human. In a preferred aspect, the mammal is a human.<br>
The term "individual(s)" is defined as a single mammal to which is<br>
administered a compound of the present invention. The mammal may be, for<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
example, a mouse, rat, pig, horse, rabbit, goat, cow, cat, dog, or human. In a preferred<br>
aspect, the individual is a human.<br>
A radical and its heteroatom-substituted version (e.g., aryl and heteroaryl; the<br>
"hetero" substituent comprising one or more heteroatoms like, for example, N, 0, S,<br>
and P) can be referred to together with a parenthetical (hetero) prefix. For example,<br>
"(hetero)aryl" refers to both aryl and heteroaryl radicals as they are defined herein.<br>
Further, because each radical definition also includes optional substitutions and,<br>
where appropriate, straight, branched and/or cyclic character (e.g., (hetero)alkyl and<br>
(hetero)alkenyl radicals, and others, can possess straight-chained, branched and/or<br>
cycloalkyl/cycloalkenyl character), reference to (hetero)radicals (e.g., "(hetero)aryl"<br>
and "(hetero)alkyl") refers to radicals that optionally contain one or more heteroatoms<br>
and, where appropriate, can contain straight-chained, branched, and/or cyclical<br>
character (and combinations thereof as described herein). Likewise, chemical<br>
descriptions including combinations of (hetero)radicals (e.g.,<br>
"(hetero)alkyl(hetero)aryloxycarbonyl") can refer to combinations of any of the<br>
characteristics contains each radical as described above. Thus, a<br>
"(hetero)alkyl(hetero)aryloxycarbonyl" moiety can refer to, for example, an<br>
optionally-substituted, linear, branched, and/or cyclic (hetero)alkyl-substituted,<br>
optionally-substituted (hetero)aryloxycarbonyl moiety. As (hetero)aryl radicals are<br>
optionally substituted as described in their definition, one or more additional<br>
substitutions beyond the specified (hetero)alkyl substitution(s) may be present. As an<br>
additional example, references to sequential combinations of the same radical (e.g.,<br>
(hetero)alkyl(hetero)alkyloxy) also refers to all combinations of each radical. For<br>
instance, a (hetero)alkyl(hetero)alkyloxy radical can refer to, as one of many<br>
examples, a branched-chain alkyl-substituted, heterocyclic alkyloxy radical.<br>
However, a (hetero)alkyl(hetero)alkyloxy radical can also refer to, as another of many<br>
examples, a straight-chain alkyl-substituted, heterocyclic alkyloxy radical. Thus, each<br>
"(hetero)alkyl" radical in "(hetero)alkyl(hetero)alkyloxy" can have different<br>
characteristics, from containing one or more heteroatoms or no heteroatoms, to alkyl<br>
chains of different lengths and linear, branched or cyclic character, and the like.<br>
Similarly, using the previous example, each (hetero)alkyl radical can have the same<br>
general characteristics. For example, a (hetero)alkyl(hetero)alkyloxy radical can refer<br>
to a heterocyclic alkyl-substituted heterocyclic alkyloxy radical. However, the term<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
"heterocyclic alkyl-substituted heterocyclic allcyloxy radicals" encompasses more<br>
than one specie (e.g., a C6 versus a C8 heterocyclic alkyl substituent). Thus, while<br>
general characteristics of identically-named sequential radicals may be the same, as in.<br>
the immediately-previous example, the specific chemical definition of each radical<br>
need not be the same.<br>
Combinations of these terms for functional group radicals are also used.<br>
Typically, the last term in the designation contains the radical that bonds to the<br>
remainder of the chemical structure. For example, "haloalkyl" refers to an alkyl<br>
radical substituted by a halogen, "cycloalkylalkyl" refers to alkyl radical substituted<br>
by a cycloalkyl, and "alkylcycloalkyl" refers to a cycloalkyl radical substituted by an<br>
alkyl.<br>
For simplicity, chemical moieties are defined and referred to throughout<br>
primarily as univalent chemical moieties (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.). Nevertheless, such<br>
terms are also used to convey corresponding multivalent moieties under the<br>
appropriate structural circumstances clear to those skilled in the art. For example,<br>
while an "alkyl" moiety generally refers to a monovalent group (e.g. CH3-CH2-), in<br>
certain circumstances a bivalent linking moiety can be "alkyl," in which case those<br>
skilled in the art will understand the alkyl to be a divalent group (e.g., -CH2-CH2-),<br>
which is equivalent to the term "alkylene." (Similarly, in circumstances in which a<br>
divalent moiety is required and is stated as being "aryl," those skilled in the art will<br>
understand that the term "aryl" refers to the corresponding divalent moiety, arylene.)<br>
All atoms are understood to have their normal number of valences for bond formation<br>
(i.e., 4 for carbon, 3 for N, 2 for O, and 2, 4, or 6 for S, depending on the oxidation<br>
state of the S).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using<br>
the preceding description, practice the present invention to its fullest extent. The<br>
following detailed examples describe how to prepare the various compounds (i.e.,<br>
those encompassed by Formulae 1-4, as well as those encompassed by Formula 5,<br>
which are synthesized from Formulae 1-4) and/or perform the various processes of the<br>
invention and are to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitations of the<br>
preceding disclosure in any way whatsoever. Those skilled in the art will promptly<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2007/011835	PCT/US2006/027599<br>
recognize appropriate variations from the procedures both as to reactants and as to<br>
reaction conditions and techniques.<br>
Preparations of the novel compounds of the present invention are illustrated in<br>
the following example, which is not, however, intended to be any limitation thereof.<br>
Descriptions of reactions described herein may recite specific amounts of<br>
reagents or "parts by weight" and "mole fractions." References to "parts by weight"<br>
and "mole fractions" describe, for example, the mass and stoichiometric relationships<br>
between the reagents utilized in the reactions, based on an arbitrarily assigned<br>
standard. For example, in a reaction that calls for the use of 36 g (approximately 2<br>
moles) of water, water may be chosen as a reference reagent. As a reference reagent,<br>
the amount of water used in mass and moles can be defined as, for example, 1 part by<br>
weight and 1x mole fraction. Thus, in the example of this paragraph, 36g of water is<br>
defined as 1 part by weight, and 2 moles of water is defined as lx mole fraction. The<br>
choice of a reference reagent for a single reaction or in a reaction scheme is wholly<br>
arbitrary, as is the choice of the reference number for parts by weight and mole<br>
fraction, here having chosen "1" for each.<br>
Thereinafter, the amounts of reagents can be described in terms relative to the<br>
water, or any other chosen reference reagent. For example, the use of 400 g (4.55<br>
moles) of ethyl acetate (molecular weight = 88 g) can be described as 400g/36g, or<br>
11.1, parts by weight and 4.55mole/2mole, or 2.27x, mole fraction.<br>

water. The organic layer was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was<br>
redissolved in, for example, ethyl acetate and washed with water and 10% aqueous<br>
sodium chloride solution. The washed ethyl acetate solution of phenol methyl ester<br>
product was drained to a clean vessel. The second half of the dimethyl aryl ketone<br>
starting material was converted to phenol methyl ester by this same procedure and<br>
workup. A total of approximatelyl9.96 parts by weight ethyl acetate solution of<br>
phenol methyl ester product was produced in the two exemplary runs described<br>

addition. The reaction mixture was washed with, for example, ethyl acetate and the<br>
aqueous product layer was separated. The aqueous layer was cooled and acidified<br>
with cone, hydrochloric acid (approximately 1.08 parts by weight, 1.89x mole<br>
fraction) to precipitate the product. The product suspension was held at about 35-40<br>
°C for about 1 hour, followed by collecting the product in a filter. The solids were<br>
washed with water and then resuspended in water, collected on a filter, and washed<br>
with water. The water-wet cake was resuspended in toluene, and the solids were dried<br>
by distillation of the toluene-water azeotrope under vacuum at not more than about 45<br>
°C. The solids were then collected by filtration and washed with, for example,<br>
toluene. This process was repeated with the remaining half of the phenol acid starting<br>

The enol-lactone produced via the above exemplary steps (i.e., that of Formula<br>
3, and of its tautomer, Formula 4) can be useful to generate a wide variety of<br>
compounds that can be used to reduce arrhythmias in individuals in need of such<br>
effects. The following exemplary steps, combined with the steps above, describe a<br>
method for synthesizing one member of the genus described by the generic formula,<br>
Formula 5, which is (R)-sec-butyl 2-(3-(4-(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy)-3,5-<br>
diiodobenzoyl)benzofuran-2-yl)acetate. Importantly, however, the methodology is<br>
applicable to a wide variety of compounds of the genus described by Formula 5.<br>
Other compounds described by the genus of Formula 5 can be made by, for example,<br>
substituting a different reacting species in step 5 (for example, Fl2 or Br2 for I2), or<br>
deleting step 5 to retain the hydrogens on the "phenol acid", both synthetic routes<br>
generating compounds encompassed by Formula 1, and that of its tautomer, Formula<br>
2. Additional cumulative or independent changes can be made to other steps in the<br>
described method, for example, the substitution of different alcohols in step 7 and/or<br>
different amines in step 8, below. Thus, the method of Example 1, and the disclosure<br>
provided elsewhere herein, can be used as a guide for one of skill in the art to make<br>
compounds of Formulae 1-4 and, in turn, use those compounds to make compounds<br>
of Formula 5.<br>
