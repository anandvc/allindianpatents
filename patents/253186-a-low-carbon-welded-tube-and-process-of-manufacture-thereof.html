				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to low carbon welded tubes and process of manufacture thereof. Manufacture of welded tubes utilising draw bench processes is energy intensive process due to the need of multiple pass (to enhance mechanical properties, in particular tensile and yield strength) to reduce the diameter of the hollow to desired dimensions as only 20 to 35% reduction achievable in a single pass. Further, there is substantial material loss with every pass and poor control on dimensional stability and surface finish of the tube. The present invention provides a synergistic combination of induction and /or resistance heat treatment of the hollow and the cold rolling process resulting in remarkable reduction in energy consumption, and at the same time enhancing quality of the resulting tubes with improved dimensional stability, closeness of tolerance, reduced thickness variation, concentricity and substantial reduction in material wastage.</td>

TITLE OF INVENTION<br><br><br>
"A Low Carbon Welded Tube, System and Process of Manufacture Thereof<br>
Arihant Domestic Appliances Limited<br>
Gat No 1261, Village Sanaswadi, Pune-Nagar Road, Taluka - Shirur, District - Pune , Pin-412208<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention<br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a low carbon welded tube and process of manufacture thereof. In particular, the invention relates to a cold rolled low carbon welded tube, system and process of manufacturing of the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Tubes are used in diverse applications such as automobile, boilers, textiles, construction, scaffolding, energy sector, hydraulic cylinders, gas springs etc. The tubes are either manufactured from carbon steel or using alloying elements. If the carbon percentage is in the range of 0.01 to 0.4, the tubes are conventionally known as low carbon steel tubes. There are two categories of tubes viz. seamless and welded. Seamless tubes are manufactured by the extruding the stock whereas welded tube is manufactured from the formed stripe that is welded at the seam. The seamless tubes are used for the critical applications wherein end applications demands stringent dimensional tolerances, surface finish and mechanical properties such as yield strength and tensile strength.<br>
The welded tube manufacturing processes generally comprise of steps that include<br>
√        stripe cutting according to the final tube size;<br>
√        forming of the stripe;<br>
√        Electric Resistance Welding (ERW) welding along the seam of the formed<br>
stripe to produce hollow; √        pointing operation wherein part of the tube is squeezed to provide holding<br>
margin / region for the draw bench gripper which is used to pull the tube<br>
through the draw bench. The squeezed portion which is left is a process<br>
waste; √        drawing process wherein the hollow is drawn through a draw bench to<br>
reduce the tube diameter to a desired level; √        straightening; S        heat treatment to release stresses and<br><br><br>
√        surface treatment.<br>
Generally, a multiple passes are necessary to complete the operation thereby making the process highly energy intensive with generation of waste at every stage of the cycle.<br>
The reduction of tube diameter from the hollow (formed tube in welded condition) is necessary for achieving desired dimensions and enhancing mechanical properties such as yield, tensile, percentage elongation and hardness of the tube. The tensile and yield strength is proportional to the percentage reduction of the hollow to final tube diameter. Using draw bench, the reduction of the tube diameter is limited to 25% only in one pass.<br>
Generally the hollow used is of cross section that is 40% to 50 % more than that of the final drawn tube. This necessitates passing the tube for more than once, generally known as multiple pass through the draw bench to achieve desired dimensions and mechanical properties. It is to be underlined that for each of the pass through draw bench, it is necessary to heat treat the tube and provide pointing region which is of the order of 7% of the length of the tube. Thus for every pass there is a loss of 7% of the material is wasted and substantial energy is consumed for heat treatment. Further the processes of tube straightening and surface treatment is to be repeated. The use of draw bench also imposes limitation on the dimensional stability / maintaining closeness of tolerance. Therefore, the manufacture of tube for the critical / precision applications is limited using this process.<br>
It is well established fact that the seamless tubes are used and preferred for critical application and hence are expensive. Conventionally, welded tubes are not being preferred for critical / precision application due to the danger of cracking, weld opening, failure under pressure.<br>

Review of the prior art reveals that the low carbon (0.01 to 0.4%) welded tubes using cold rolling process are not reported in the prior art rather alloy steel tubes are being reported to the great extent. The use of welded tubes for precision application is also not reported. Further the draw bench process in the manufacture of welded tubes suffer from limitations such as: √ Need of multiple pass (to enhance mechanical properties, in particular tensile and yield strength) to reduce the diameter of the hollow to desired dimensions as the maximum reduction in single pass is only 20 to 25% √        Repetitions   of number of processes such as heat treatment, pointing,<br>
surface treatment with each pass √        Substantial material loss in during each of the pass √        Substantial energy consumption in each of the process in each pass √        Poor control on dimensional stability of the tube √        Limitation on achieving surface finish of the tube<br>
The necessity is constantly felt to provide low carbon welded tube using cold roll process so as to achieve surface finish, closeness of tolerance and mechanical<br><br><br>
properties at par with the seamless tubes and provide process of manufacture of such tube.<br>

Thus in accordance with the invention, the process for manufacture of the welded tubes comprises steps of:<br><br><br>
√        stripe cutting according to the final tube size;<br>
√       forming of the stripe;<br>
√ electric resistance welding along the seam of the formed stripe to produce hollow wherein the coil in the proximity of the tube and welding rolls induces a magnetic field that is concentrated on the open seam by the impeder which is disposed inside the tube resulting a flow of electrons on the edges of the strip to generate heat along the seam to fusion temperature. The weld rolls then fuse the open seam to complete the welding process to produce hollow;<br>
√        heat treatment using induction means that comprises of AC power supply, induction coil wherein hollow is disposed in the said coil wherein the power supply sends alternating current through the coil resulting in generation of magnetic field that induces eddy currents in the hollow that results in heating the hollow uniformly<br>

In another aspect of the invention mandrel is provided with internal passages for lubricant that open at the mandrel and internal tube diameter interface to facilitate<br><br><br>
lubrication at the said surface.    In yet another aspect of invention resistance heating is used in place of induction heat treatment process.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Features and advantages of the invention will become apparent in the following detailed description and preferred embodiments.<br>
The process for manufacture of the welded tubes comprises steps of:<br>
√       stripe cutting according to the final tube size;<br>
√       forming of the stripe;<br>
√ electric resistance welding along the seam of the formed stripe to produce hollow wherein the coil in the proximity of the tube and welding rolls induces a magnetic field that is concentrated on the open seam by the impeder which is disposed inside the tube resulting a flow of electrons on the edges of the strip to generate heat along the seam to fusion temperature. The weld rolls then fuse the open seam to complete the welding process to produce hollow;<br>
√        heat treatment using induction means that comprises of AC power supply, induction coil wherein hollow is disposed in the said coil wherein the power supply sends alternating current through the coil resulting in generation of magnetic field that induces eddy currents in the hollow that results in heating the hollow uniformly<br>
√        optional surface treatment of the hollow;<br>
√ cold rolling process wherein the hollow is reciprocated under cam shaped profiled rolls wherein in the first step the tube is moved forward under the rolls. The profiles of the rolls are shaped so that on rotation they bite into the tube to force it down onto the mandrel wherein the mandrel is disposed inside the tube. The mandrel is then moved back to drag the tube against the rolls and smooth its outside diameter, the cycle is repeated<br>
The low carbon cold rolled wefded tube comprises of Carbon % in the range of 0.18 to 0.38, Mn % in the range of 0.41 to 1.33, Silicon % in the range of 0.01 to<br><br><br>
0.25, Sulphur % in the range of 0.004 to 0.011, Phosphorous % in the range of 0.007 to 0.019, Aluminum % in the range of 0.025 to 0.05 and Niobium % in particular grades in the range of 0.01 to 0.03 but not limited to it. The said ranges cover the grades such as SAE 1020, SAE 1026, SAE 1541, SAE 1010, SAE 1012, SAE 1018, SAE 1006, SAE 1018, SAE 1527, SAE 1010 (modified), IS 1079 Gr.D, IS 7048 Gr.3, IS 7048 Gr.D, DIN 17100 St.52.3<br>
The welding of the rolled stripe at the seams is carried out by means of high frequency resistance welder that comprises of induction coil and impeder wherein induction coil induces the electrical current in the metal due to magnetic field generated by the induction coil resulting in generation of heat at the edges of strips and thus resulting in fusion of both the edges with each other wherein the composition of the weld is that of the parent material by virtue of the fusion of patent material itself. The welded tubes are induction annealed uniformly over the length of the tube such that the difference of hardness of the welded area / heat affected zone and parent material is substantially reduced resulting in substantial reduction of the welding related stresses.<br>
In one of the embodiments system is provided for forming the stripe and further welding the same so as to substantially reduced springing back tendency of the partially formed stripe.<br>
In another embodiment mandrel is provided with internal passages for lubricant that open at the mandrel and internal tube diameter interface to facilitate lubrication at the said surface. In another embodiment mandrel is provided with tapered profile.<br>
In another embodiment hollow is surface treated to facilitate lubrication at the inner diameter surface and mandrel during the process of cold rolling.<br>
In another embodiment a system is provided to control tube feed increment and rotational angle in tandem according to the size of the tube. In another embodiment driving system is provided to couple and coordinate process of rotation of the rolls and tube feeding.<br><br><br>
Thus it is evident from the present invention that the synergistic combination of induction and /or resistance heat treatment of the hollow and the cold rolling process results in obviating problems of multiple pass encountered during draw bench process leading to substantially reducing the energy consumption of the tube manufacture process, enhancing quality of the tubes by improving their dimensional stability, closeness of tolerance, reduced thickness variation, concentricity and substantial reduction in material wastage.<br><br>
