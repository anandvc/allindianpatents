				<td>This invention relates to a connector-equipped cord, which has at one end thereof a connector, for use as a handle string for a porch, a folding uriibrella, a handy phone, etc. and also as a pull string for a slide fastener slider. 2. Description of the Related Art:<br>
In a conventional handle string of this type for porches, holding umbrellas, handy phones, etc., a cord is inserted through a ring or a swivel connector and is fixed to it by a screw or a ring holder. Then in use, the ring or swivel connector is attached to a porch, a folding umbrella, a handy phone, etc. Further, as a pull string for a slide fastener slider, it is known to insert a cord through a hole in a free end of a pull tab of the slide fastener slider and is fixed to it by a screw, and then to attach the resvilting slide fastener to an opening in, for exanple, a porch.<br>
Further, FIG. 10 of the accatpanylng drawings shows a cord disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 1-48761. In this conventional cord, opposite ends of the cord 102 abut with each other to form a loop and embedded in a thick-plate terminal 103 molded of thermoplastic resin having a central hole 112.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a slide fastener slider pull tab disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 5-10654. This<br><br>
cxjnventional pull tab is corrposed of a first mariber 201 made of metal or hard thermoplastic resin and having a connecting ring at one end and an engaging portion 204 in a form of a transverse T groove at the other end, and a second member 202 made of soft and elastic thermoplastic resin and having an engaged portion 207 in a form of an enlarged head, which is to be fitted in the T groove, at one end and a ribbed grip at the other end.<br>
FIG. 12 shows an attaching manber, for a pull tab of a slide fastener slider, vdiich is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 1-89006. This attaching member, vAiich is made of resilliently deformable material, has at one end a ring 305 to be loosely attached to a pull-tab-attadhing lug on a slider body and at the other end a pair of jaws 303 for clanping a free end of the pull tab 302, each jaw 303 having on its inner surface a nucriber of teeth 304 extending in different directions.<br>
However, in any of the conventional handle cords using a ring or a swivel connector, since the cord is inserted through the ring or the swivel connector and is then folded, and thereafter, the folded portion is secured by the screw or the ring holder, great load would act on the folded portion vdien the pull tab is pulled or turned, thus damaging the cord so that adequate durability cannot be ejcpected.<br>
In the cord of FIG. 10, since the abutting opposite ends 107 of the cord 102 are embedded in the terminal 103 molded of thermoplastic synthetic resin by Injection molding means, only<br><br>
non-stable connection of the cord 102 can be achieved. Also this conventional cord requires a relatively complex manufacturing process and therefore is not suitable for mass production.<br>
Further, in the conventional pull tab of FIG. 11, since a neck portion of the enlarged head of the engaged portion 207 of the second maiiber 202 is smaller In thickness than the ranaining portion, there is a danger that the piiLL tab might be damaged if a great pull force acts on the pull tab v*dle using. In the conventional pull tab attaching matiber of FIG. 12, since the teeth 304 on the inner surface of each of the opposite jaws 303 of the attaching mariber have to be formed so as to esrtend in different directions, it needs a coiplex manufacturing process for such attaching maiiber, thus causing only a limited rate of production.<br>

Various preferred enbodiments of a connector-equipped cord according to this invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accoipanylng drawings.<br>
The connector-equipped cord (hereinafter called the cord) of this invention is particularly useful v*ien used as a handle cord for a bag, a folding umbrella, etc., or as a pull string for a slide fastener slider. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the cord is a two-member structure cotposed of a bifurcated connector 1 of metal and a belt 2 of synthetic fibers. The connector 1 includes a pair of jaws 3, each jaw 3 having on its inner surface two rows of transverse teeth 4 confronting those on an opposite jaw 3. The connector 1 also includes a connecting ring 5 to be attached to a product, pivotally attached to a stpport 6 projecting fran an outer surface of a coimon base of the jasra 3.<br>
The belt 2 may be a braid, a knit string or a woven tape, each<br><br>
of viiich is formed of synthetic fiber yams such as of polyamide, polyester, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene or polypropylene, or a stiff flat string formed of a non-woven synthetic fiber cloth, or a flat string of fake leather such as synthetic leather or artificial leather, or natural leather.<br>
The belt 2 has on one surface of each of opposite ends 7 two rows of ridges 8 extending transversely and molded of thermoplastic resin, such as polyamide, polyacetal, polypropylene and polybutyleneterephtalate, by injection molding means. The belt 2 is folded double about its center in such a manner that the molded ridges 8 are e3qx)sed on the outer surfaces, and then the molded ridges 8 are inserted between the upper and lower jaws 3 of the connector 1 so as to be caught by the teeth 4 on the upper and lower jaws 3. Besides the ridges 8, the belt 2 end surfaces are clanped by the teeth 4. The length of the belt 2 depends on the kind of a product to v*iich the cord is to be connected.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a second enbodiment similar to the foregoing enibodiment except that two teeth 4 project from the inner surface of the ipper jaw 3 vArLle only a single tooth 4 projects from the inner siicface of the lower jaw 3. Also only one end 7 of the unfolded belt 2 v*iich is not folded is clartped between the upper and lower jaws 3, and has molded ridges 8 facing upwardly and caught by the two teeth 4 on the upper jaw 3, while the other end 7 is left not clairped.<br>
The two molded ridges 8 exposed on the surface of the other end<br><br>
7 of the belt 2 serves to prevent the same belt end 7 frem being frayed and to perform a non-skid function vAien the cord is used as a slide fastener pull tab.<br>
This belt 2 is manufactured by the injection molding means as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. For exanple, a continuous length of belt 2 of synthetic fibers is continuously supplied to a molding machine in vtoLch upper and lower dies 15, 16 are disposed in confronting relation so as to define between than a belt channel 17, the upper die 15 having four ridge-forming cavities 18 spaced at equal distances and ccmnunicating with the belt channel 17. In timed relation to this continuous supply of the belt 2, thermoplastic resin is molded on an upper surface of the belt 2 by injection. Thus successive groups of four-ridges 8 are molded at equal distances on one surface of the continuous belt 2, viiereupon the continuoios belt 2 is severed centrally at every group of four-ridges 8 to conplete individual belts 2 of a predetermined length each having two ridge 8 at each end.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a third onbodiment similar to the second embodiment except that each of opposite jaws 3 of a bifurcated connector 1 has only a single tooth 4 at its distal end and that a connecting ring 5 integrally projects fron the outer surface of a cannon base of the opposite jaws 3. Also the belt 2 has a pair of ridges 8 molded one on each of upper and lower surfaces; the ridges 8 on the urpper and lower surfaces of one belt end 7 are cau^t by the teeth 4 of the upper and lower javre 3, vAiile those on the other belt end 7 are left free.<br><br>
Alternatively the ridge 8 may be molded on only one surf aoe of the belt 2.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a fourth OTbodlment in vdxLch one side of a clanping member having a U-shape cax)ss-section is closed by a side wall 9, the claroping member 3 having in a f ix)nt end thereof a slot 10 through v*u.dh the belt 2 is to be inserted. Each of upper and lower inner surfaces of the clanping member 3 has a single rectangular tooth 4 projecting centrally therefrom and having at one side a slope 11. The belt 2 has on one surface at eacii end 7 thereof a molded plate 28 having in its surface a central recess 12 and a stepped side groove 13 comnwnicating with the central recess 12. The side groove 13 has a slope 14 at a side toward the central recess 12.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a connector-equipped cord according to a fifth embodiment. In the illustrated oiibodlinent, the clanping member 3 having a U-shape cross section has a pair of openings at its opposite side surfaces, and has in a front end thereof a slot 10 through v*iich the belt 2 is to be Inserted. Each of upper and lower inner surfaces of the clanping member 3 has a single rectangular tooth 4 projecting centrally therefrom. The belt 2 has on one surface at each end 7 thereof a molded plate 28, in vdxLch a central recess 12 is formed. The recess 12 has on its opposite sides a pair of side grooves 13 and slopes 14 v^iich form steps at the respective sides of the recess 12.<br>
For connecting the thus formed connector 1 and belt 2 together, the belt 2 is folded double with the molded plate 28 facing outwardly.<br><br>
and the plate 28 are Inserted in the U-shaps|cax)ss-section clanping mariber 3 from either side so that the tooth 4 is moved along the side groove 13 to fit in the central recess 12, thus securing the connection between the connector 1 and the belt 2. During this Inserting, the tooth 4 can be smoothly moved from the side groove 13 to the central recess 12 owing to the slope 14.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a sixth embodiment in vAiich two teeth 4 are arranged in a staggered pattern projecting centrally on each of the inner surfaces of the clanping maiiber 3 of the connector 1, each tooth 4 having an outer half surface sloping down to its end and an inner half surface in level. On the other hand, a single plate 28 molded on each end 7 of the belt 2 has a generally S-shape recess 12 centrally in its svirface for receiving the staggered two teeth 4 and has a guide surface 14 on each side to facilitate inserting the teeth 4 into the recess 12 from either side.<br>
In the foregoing illustrated embodiments, the ridges 8 or the plate 28 may be Integrally molded with the belt 2 by an injection molding means.<br>
FIGS .2,3 and 6, reference number 19 designates a slide fastener slider for v*iich the connector-equipped cord of this invention is to be used, and in FIG. 5, reference number 20 designates cutting lines for severing the continuous belt 2 into the individual belts 2.<br>
The connector-equipped cord of this invention has the following advantageous results:<br><br>
According to the first aspect of the Invention, since the metallic connector 1 has teeth 4 on the inner surface of each of upper and lower jaws 3 and a connecting ring 5 attached to the outer surface of a cormon base of the upper and lower jaws 3 while the belt 2 has on its ends thermoplastic resin ridges 8 to be caught by the teeth 4, it is possible to attach the belt 2, v*iich serves as a handle string or a slide fastener slider pull string, to the connector 1 sinply and neatly with adequate firmness and to lirprove the rate of production and hence make it suitable for mass production.<br>
Further, partly since the belt 2 has two ridges 8 on each of opposite ends 7 viiiile the connector 1 has two teeth 4 on the inner surface of each of the upper and lower jav/s 3, and partly since the ridges 8 on opposite ends 7 of the belt 2 are clairped between the teeth 4 of the tpper and lower jaws 3 as the connector 1 is compressed from the upper and lower sides, it is possible to facilitate mantifacttiring the connector-equipped cord.<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, partly since a molded plate 28 on each end of the belt 2 has in its surface a central recess 12 and a guide surface 14 adjacent to the central recess 12 while a clattping merriber of U-shape cross section has centrally on each of its inner surfaces a tooth 4 to be inserted in the corresponding recess 12 along the guide surface 14 from its side, it is possible to insert the belt 2 into the connector 1 sideways, thus facilitating manufacturing the connector-equipped cord.<br><br>
Since the molded ridges 8 or plate 28 are disposed at least one surface of opposite ends 7 of the belt 2, it is possible to easily mold the ridges 8 or the plate 28 and to reinforce the ends 7 of the belt 2 to thereby make the connector-equipped cord durable and easy to handle.<br>
Further, since the belt 2 is attached in a U-bent form to the connector 1, it is possible to make the connector-equipped cord easy to handle.<br>
Furthermore, since the belt 2 is a braid, a knit string, a knit or a woven tape, each of which is composed of synthetic fiber yams such as polyamide, polyester, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene or polypropylene, or a flat string of non-woven cloth ccrrposed of synthetic fibers, or a flat string of synthetic leather, artificial leather, or natural leather, it is possible to fuse the thermoplastic resin ridges 8 with the surface of the belt 2 of synthetic fibers so that the belt 2 can be attached to the connector firmly.<br><br><br>
