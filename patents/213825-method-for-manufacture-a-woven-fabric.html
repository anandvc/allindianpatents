Method and device for the manufacture of woven fabric<br>
The invention relates to a method for the manufacture of woven fabric in limited lengths and a device for this method.<br>
The manufacture of woven fabric is today done on weaving machines, which pull their warp threads from a warp beam, that is normally prepared for warp-lengths  or  lot  sizes  of more  than   1000  yards.   The  warp-beam   is  a  major element for the manufacture of woven fabric.  For  its own manufacture there is a time consuming and costly process that is relatively independent from me warp   length.   Therefore   only   long   warp   lengths,   as   indicated   before,   are economically feasable in the manufacture of woven fabric. For the manufacture of standard  fabric,   for example  for a normal  white shirt fabric,   it does  not matter that the fabric has to be produced in so large lot sizes,  because  this kind of fabric  is always used as a standard  fabric.   But for  the fast moving fashion cycles which often require a huge variety of patterns,  the manufacture of a normal warp beam is a handicap, because it is very difficult to forecast how much of a specific fabric will be sold later on.<br>
Therefore   it   is   a   requirement   today   to   find  an  economical   process   that enables the manufacture of woven fabric in relatively short lengths (small lot<br><br>
sizes), for example in lengths of a few hundred yards and below. A warp beam for such a short length requires so much work, that the woven fabric becomes much more expensive per yard, often so much more, that the manufacture of this fabric is economically not justifiable anymore.<br>
The purpose of this invention is, to create a method for the manufacture of woven fabric in short lengths, for which the manufacture of a special warp beam is not economical or takes too much time.<br>
Following claim  1, this is done trough a method with the following steps:<br>
laying a layer of warp threads on a warp frame having a size which is determinative of the limited length of the fabric and holding said warp threads on said warp frame,<br>
moving said warp frame to a weft insertion mechanism having a shed forming device,<br>
laying weft threads into said warp threads while operating said shed forming device,<br>
transporting said warp frame having a completed fabric thereon to a fabric removal station, removing said completed fabric from said warp frame.<br>
For the method according to this invention no warp beam is needed. For laying of the warp threads in the warp thread station a warp frame is used, over which length the warp threads are laved and held onto the warp frame.<br><br>
For the laying of the warp threads over the warp frame the known technologies for drawing-in (EPPS 460129B1, EP 0391612) and/ or for weft-insertion (DEPS 3821224) can be used, i.e. in the first process-step a parallel laying of threads is done in a way like weft-threads are layed, these threads are then used as the warp threads for the subsequent manufacture of the woven fabric. Also for holding of the threads at the warp frame known technologies can be used, for example the known clamping of warp-threads in drawing-in-machines (WO 93/06282, DEAS 2625746, USPS 3523432).<br>
This so manufactured semi finished product in form of a layer of next to each<br>
other laying warp threads within the warp frame is then completed, by bringing<br>
in of the warp frame by means of the first transfer step into the weft thread<br>
insertion mechanism.  Here,  within the weft thread station the shed formation<br>
is done with a known shed forming-device (e.g. shed forming comb elements<br>
with  guide  bars,   heddle  shafts   with  heddles,   Jaquard   heddles).   If weaving<br>
heddles or Jaquard heddles are  used,  they are already  interspersed  with the<br>
warp threads  in the warp thread station. The warp-frame is thereby, with the<br>
warp  threads   that are  held by  it,   prepared   for  the shed  formation and  the<br>
laying of the weft threads, which are then layed  in a known fashion and are<br>
beaten up  to  the  fabric  fell. Thereby,  the  fabric   is manufactured  within the<br>
warp frame up to the length and width that is determined by the warp frame.<br>
The  beating  up  of the  weft thread  onto  the  fabric-fell  can be  done  with  a<br>
closed reed, which would also be already interspersed with the warp-threads in<br>
the warp-thread-station, as well as with an open reed (reed-comb). In this way<br>
a piece of woven fabric is manufactured without the need of a warp beam.<br>
Woven fabric for apparel and other end uses can thus be manufactured very<br><br>
quickly in the required sizes and patterns, because the warp frames can be big enough to allow the manufacture of large enough pieces of fabric. The finished fabric can be taken out of the warp-frame and can directly be used for the manufacture of pieces of apparel. It is also possible to do the necessary cutting of the fabric already within the warp frame. After taking out the fabric or the remaining fabric-pieces after cutting, the warp frame is reused for laying of warp threads in the warp thread station.<br>
The fabric in the warp-frame can also be run in its semi-finished state through further processes like they are used for the manufacture of woven fabric today, like sizing of the warp threads before the weft-insertion or finishing processes of the completed fabric.<br>
A major advantage of the invented method is the fact, that small lot-sizes (relativly short fabric-lengths) can be manufactured economically, which is not possible by using a warp-beam. The manufacture of a warp beam consists of preparation-costs that are relatively independent of the warp-lengths, and thereby grow in importance the shorter the woven fabric is. The required long fabric lengths of today also lead to extensive ware housing which in turn lead to a very long total throughput time from the start of the process up to the end<br>
product in form of a finished piece of apparel. This total through-put time can be drastically reduced by the invented manufacturing method, because relatively short fabric lenghts can be manufactured according to a certain customer demand.<br>
The invented manufacturing-method facilitates thereby in a decisive way the<br>
economical manufacture of woven fabric and the resulting fabric-samples that<br>
have to follow the fast moving changes  in fashion. This is achieved, because<br>
on the one hand as described above the relatively short fabric lengths enable<br>
a quick reaction to individual customer demands and on the other hand make<br>
a quick reordering of a fabric possible which is required,  if a fabric or the<br>
resulting piece of apparel sells better than expected. This quick reaction until<br>
today   was   impossible   in   an   economical   way,   although   it   is   already   a<br>
requirement of retailing for a long time. The invented manufacturing method<br>
will lead to an enourmous increase in speed and flexibility for the entire textile<br>
chain and can lead to bringing back a lot of textile jobs into high labour cost<br>
countries.<br>
It is possible that the warp-frame holds the layer of warp threads taut or slack. Especially during the transfer steps the warp threads may be held slack, what could possibly lead to a space saving. In addition the slack holding may be helpful during sizing or the finishing-processes. Nevertheless the layer of warp threads has to be held at least partially taut where the weft threads are layed.<br>
Especially in the warp thread-station the laying of the warp threads can be done essentially in a vertical direction, hereby gravity can be used to help guiding and straightening the warp-threads. This may also lead to a space saving compared to the horizontal positioning. But it is also possible to use the horizontal positioning for the whole method.<br>
It is also possible to link up the warp threads of two warp frames, e.g. by using a conventinal knotting machine. This could help to eliminate the need to intersperse the heddles and the reed in the warp thread station. The shaft of the warp frame would then be removed after knotting and before running through the weft thread station.<br>
The device for the above described method consits mainly of the mentioned warp frame, that can be carried out in several different ways. At first it is necessary to provide at least two strips, shafts or rails with thread-holding-devices to face each other, that are holding the layer of warp-threads. In this case this strips, shafts or rails have to be held at the required distance from each other through special means, while the thread holding devices ensure that the threads can not slip off.<br>
If a fixed frame should be used for carrying out this manufacturing method, then the two facing strips, shafts or rails are connected by two bridges that are holding the strips, shafts or rails at a fixed distance to each other. The result is a fixed object, that is advantageous especially for short frame lenghts.<br>
It is also possible, to arrange the strips, shafts or rails in such a way, that they are moveable between the distance that is defined by the length of the held warp threads and a shorter distance. This is helpful, when for example the layer of warp threads is at first layed taut over the warp frame and after that the next transport is done in a slack way. In the latter case the layer of warp threads would then hang below the strips, shafts or rails. Hereby it is also possible to form at least one of the strips, shafts or rails as a rotatable cylinder. This can help to save space, for example in the weft thread station.<br>
If only one cylinder  is  rotatable,   it is possible to use a convential practice<br>
thread carriage like it is used in warp knitting that runs across the warp frame<br>
from one side to the other, in which case through unwinding or onwinding of<br>
the previously layed warp-threads one shot after the other is layed continuously<br>
in such a way, that the fabric is formed. Hereby it is of course necessary, that<br>
one of the cylinders either the rotatable or the non rotatable moves towards the<br>
other or away from it, i.e. it has to be linked to a transfer mechanism. It is<br>
also possible, that both shafts or cylinders are rotatable, which would give the<br>
same effect regarding the space-saving, but without needing to move one of the<br>
cylinders relative to the other.   Hereby it has to be taken  into account,  that<br>
such an arrangement could be easier to retrofitt into existing weaving machines<br>
with their drive mechanisms for the warp beam.<br>
The   invention  is explained   in  more  detail  below by  means  of exemplary embodiments and the drawings:<br>
They show:<br>

Figure 11:     the addition of the process step of sizing, Figure 12:   the process step of finishing,<br><br>
Figure 13:     the process step of cutting.<br>
In Figure 1 a plant according to the invented method is shown, that contains the warp thread station 1, the weft thread-station 2 and the take-out-station 3. In each of these stations a warp-frame 4 ist shown, that consists of the two shafts 5 and 6 and of the connecting bridges 7 and 8. Within the warp<br>
thread station 1 warp-threads 9 are layed over the warp-frame 4, by operating the insertion mechanisms 10 and 11, that work like normal weft insertion- and/ or drawing-in mechanisms, which in this case lay threads, that are used as warp-threads for the final fabric later on. Hereby the warp-threads are held in the area of the shafts 5 and 6 for example by holding-devices like they are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. Through moving of the warp-frame 4 relative to the insertion-mechanisms 10 and 11, a layer of warp-threads is layed continuously over the whole warp frame until the frame is full. Hereby it is of course necessary to move the warp frame 4 to the right, where enough room has to be provided for this movement. Finally the warp frame is moved into the position that is indicated by dotted lines.<br>
The warp frame 15 now holding a layer of warp threads, in Fig. 1 shown in dotted lines with dotted warp threads and is then transfered by the first transfer step into the weft thread station 2. Hereby conventional weft-thread-insertion-mechanisms 12, 13 with common devices for the shed formation and the beat-up onto the fabric fell are used, which now lay the weft threads 14 across the previously layed warp-threads 9, whereby the woven fabric is created. In this station the here located warp frame 15 is moved along the weft-thread-insertion-mechanisms 12 and 13. so that finally the whole warp-frame 15 is tilled up with completed fabric. The warp frame 15 is at course<br><br>
the same   "warp-frame"  like  it  is marked with  reference 4 within the warp thread station.<br>
After complete laying of the weft threads 14 in the weft thread station, the moving out of the warp-farme is done by means of the second transfer step into the take out station 3, where the fully produced fabric can be removed from the warp frame. The production process for the desired woven fabric is now in principle complete.<br>
For the transport of the warp frame 4 respectively the warp frame 15 conventional transport-belts are used, whose detailed design does not matter within the context of this invention, i.e. conventional transport systems are employed.<br>
In Fig. 2 a plant is shown that is almost identical to the plant shown in Fig. I, where only the heddle shafts 16, 17 und 18 that are normally used for the weft insertion are drawn in. The other shown moduls in Fig. 2 are the same as in Fig. I and are therefore marked with the same references. The heddle shafts 16, 17 and 18 are held by carriers, that are marked in the area of the warp thread station with the references 19 and 20. They are provided on both sides of the warp-frame. Before the start of the production process, the frame 4 is fitted with the heddle shafts 16, that are then running through all stations, and at the end of the take out station 3 are also taken out, to be refitted into another warp frame in the warp thread station. In the heddle shafts 16, 17 and 18 the in heddleshafts used wires 21 are shown. Regarding the functioning of the plant in Fig. 2 it is referred to the descriptions for Fig.l.<br><br>
In Fig. 3 the sequence of the method is shown in three diagrams A, B and C, that are drawn superimposed over each other, which show in a way the arrangement of Figs. 1 and 2 in side elevation, whereby stations 2 and 3 are visible (station 1 is hidden by the warp-frame 4 shown in diagram A, that in this diagram is in a holding-position in front of station 2. Its holding-position is indicated in Fig. 1 and 2 by the dotted lines).<br>
Diagram A shows the warp-frame 4 with the heddle shafts  16 in the above<br>
mentioned holding-position, while warp  frame   15  is  in the area of the  weft<br>
thread  insertion mechanism   12,  i.e.  in the  weft thread station 2.  The  warp<br>
frame  15 has already arrived at the end of the weft thread insertion process,<br>
by way of transport belts, which will be described further below. At first the<br>
warp frame 15 is moved into the take out station 3 and then the warp-frame<br>
4  is  moved  into the station 2,  which  is shown  in diagram  B.   In  this  weft<br>
thread station 2, the warp frame marked with the reference 4 is filled with the<br>
weft threads, which are inserted across the warp threads. For this purpose the<br>
heddle shafts 16, are now connected to the weft thread insertion-mechanisms 12<br>
and  13 (13 is not visible in diagram B), so the weft threads can be woven in<br>
in a conventional manner as already described above. After this the previously<br>
warp-frame  15 moves further to the right, which can be seen  in diagram C.<br>
In diagram  B the previously totally fabric  filled warp  frame   15  can also be<br>
seen  in the take-out station 3, where the finished fabric can be removed out<br>
from the warp frame, whereupon the warp frame is transferred back to the warp<br>
thread station that is shown in Fig. 1 and 2. This happens, while a warp frame<br>
is within the weft thread insertion mechanisms  12 and  13, as like it is shown<br>
in diagram  C,   i.e.   during the operating  phase according  to diagram  C,   the<br><br>
warp-frame that is shown on the right side is taken away from the transport system and transferred to the warp thread-station shown in Fig. 1 and 2, if it is not planned for further processes within the warp-frame like finishing processes or cutting.<br>
For   the   transport  of the  warp-frames   4  and   15   in   the  diagrams   ABC controlled   transport  belts  are planned,  which  move   the  warp-frames,   where certain transport belts can be moved into and out of action by lifting them up or lowering them down. According to diagram A the warp frame 4 is moved by transport belt 22 with the with belt rollers 23 and 24,  but the movement only starts, if the previous warp frame is already moved out of the weft thread station 2.  The warp frame  15 within the weft thread station 2  is moved by transport belt 25 with the with belt-rollers 26 and 27, because transport belt 25 is in a higher position than transport belt 22. The warp-frame 15 is there also above the third transport belt 28 with the belt rollers 29 and 30, which takes over    the   warp-frame    15   after   it   has   completely   run   through   the   weft thread, station 2, by lifting-up (see diagram B) into a position so that transport belt 28 is above transport bell: 25. With the transport belt 28 the warp-frame 15 is moved into the end-position, that is shown in diagram B within the takeout station 3.  While this is happening, a new warp frame 4 is moved into the weft thread station, as already explained.  For this,  the transport belt 22 was lifted up, lifting the warp frame 4 as it is shown in diagram A, which is then out of reach for transport belt 25. After moving in of the warp frame 4 into the area of the weft thread  insertion mechanism   12,  the  transport belt  22  is lowered down,  so that the transport belt 25  now overlaps the warp frame 4, as it is shown in diagram C.<br>
The warp-frame that is in the weft thread station 2, is then exposed to the operation of the weft thread insertion mechanism 12, that now weaves the weft threads into the warp threads, that are held by the warp frame, until the warp-frame gets to the position that is marked with reference 15 in diagram A. While the weft threads are layed within the weft thread station 2, the finished fabric is taken out of the warp frame that is in the take-out-station 3, and this frame is then transfered back to the warp-thread-station as already explained above (see Fig. 1 and 2).<br>
Fig. 4 shows another version of the warp thread station according to Fig. 1 and 2, where the warp-threads 9 are layed in a vertical direction by the insertion-mechanisms 10 and 11. This can be mandated when the floor space is limited, and in addition this may lead to an energy saving. In the first transfer-step a transfer into the holding-position that is shown in dotted lines in Fig. 1 and 2 is then necessary, for which a conventional transfer mechanism can be used, of which the design is not relevant here.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an example for the execution of an arrangement for clamping of the warp threads , which, as indicated above, comes into effect during the laying of the warp threads in the warp thread station 1 (see description to Fig. 1). The clamping arrangement uses the shafts 5 and 6 according to Fig. 1 in the form of the halfround shafts 31 and 32, where halfround shaft 31 is held stationary, while halfround 32 is pressed continuously further against halfround-shaft 31 by the lifting-device 33, depending on the progress of laying the warp threads. The warp threads are layed by the insertion-mechanisms 10 and 11 from Fig. 1 over an additional device, in form of chain 34 with individual holders that are each equipped with a single clamp on either side, are then<br>
clamped and cut (DE-AS 26 25 746) so each holder is then holding one warp-thread, which is now moved into the area of the halfround shafts 31 and 32, where the clamps on the holders 35 are opened in a controlled movement, so the warp direads are layed next to each other with the required distance, are preclamped by the halfround shafts 31 and 32 and are finally fully clamped by bringing both halfround shafts completely together.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a sectional view along the line V -V from Figure 5. It shows the two halfround shafts 31 and 32, of which halfroundshaft 31 is equipped with an elastic strand 36, which presses onto an inserted thread, preclamps it at first and finally fully clamps it by bringing both halfround shafts completely<br>
together.<br>
Fig.   7  shows  a  warp   in a slack  manner,   held by  two  shafts  5  and  6.<br>
hanging loosly between them. If the two shafts 5 and 6 are moved away from<br>
each other,  the position shown in Fig.  8 results,  where the warp-thread 9 is<br>
shown   taut.   The   tautness   is   kept  by  the  bridge  8.   In   Fig.   9  and   10  two<br>
variants of the shafts which are belonging to the warp-frame are shown, where<br>
in Fig. 9 one shaft is is formed as a rotatable cylinder 37 and in Fig.  10 both<br>
shafts are formed as rotatable cylinders 37 and 38. With turnable cylinders like<br>
the ones shown, different distances for the two shafts of the warp frame are<br>
possible. In Fig. 11 it is shown in a schematic way, how directly after the warp<br>
thread station and before the holding-position a sizing-bath  is  introduced,  that<br>
is  used  for  the sizing  of the  warp  threads  which  were  layed  into the  warp<br>
frame  within the warp  thread station.   In the holding position a dryer 40 car.<br>
be seen,  that is used for drying of the sized warp-threads.<br>
Fig.  12 shows a finishing station, that can be introduced between the weft-thread-station  2  and  the  take-out-station  3.   In  this  finishing  station 41,  the completely woven fabric is guided over several guide rollers through a set of different baths, as they are known to be necessary for finishing processes. The transport of the woven fabric 42 is done by transport belts 43 and 44, that are running on top of each other and are guiding the woven fabric through the sequence of the different baths. The  transport belts 43 and 44 are  made of liquid-permeable material, as for example, a kind of net or a perforated rubber belt.   The   woven   fabric   42   is   guided   through   the   finishing   station   41   in individual pieces (i.e. warp-frames), where the beginning and the end are guided by the shafts 5 and 6 from which the distance holding bridges 7 and 8 were removed, so that the woven fabric can be transported over the different guide-rollers through all baths without a problem.<br>
At the exit of the finishing station the dryer 45 is shown, that is drying the processed woven fabric.<br>
Fig. 13 shows in a schematic way a cutting station, that can be introduced before or within the take-out station 3. With the rotating knife 47, that is moved by the controller 46 across the woven fabric which is still held by the warp-frame 15, the desired piece of fabric can be cut out according to a pattern-chart or electronic cutting data. For this, the warp frame 15 is put onto the cutting table 49, of which the surface holds against the woven fabric 48 from one side, so the knife 47 has a good counter point while cutting from the other side.<br><br><br><br><br>
Claims<br>
1.    Method   for  manufacturing  a  woven  fabric  (42,48)  having   a  limited length comprising the following steps:<br>
laying a layer of warp threads (9) on a warp frame (4,15) having a size  which  is  determinative  of the  limited  length  of the   fabric  and holding said warp threads (9) on said warp frame, moving said warp frame (4,15) to a weft insertion mechanism (12,13) having a shed forming device,<br>
laying weft threads (14) into said warp threads while operating said shed forming device,<br>
transporting said warp frame (4,15) having a completed fabric (42,48) thereon to a fabric removal station, removing said completed fabric (42,48) from said warp frame.<br>
2.	Method according to claim I, including the step of sizing said layer of<br>
warp  threads prior  to moving said warp  frame to said weft insertion<br>
mechanism.<br>
3.	Method  according   to	claim   1,   including   the   step   of subjecting   said<br>
woven   fabric  (41,48)	to  a  finishing  process  after  having  been  trans<br>
ferred to said removal	station while still being maintained on said warp<br>
frame (4,15).<br>
4.	Method according to claim   1,  including the step of cutting the woven<br>
fabric (42,48) while still being maintained on said warp  frame (4,15).<br>
5.	Method of claim 1, including the steps of holding the warp threads (9)<br>
taut or slack in said warp frame.<br>
6.	Method of claim 1, including the step of laying said warp threads (9)<br>
while said warp frame is positioned in a horizontal mode.<br>
7.	Method of claim  1, including the step of laying said warp threads (9)<br>
while said warp frame is positioned in a vertical mode.<br>
8.	Method of claim 1, including the step of connecting the warp threads<br>
of two warp frames onto each other, e.g. by knotting.<br>
9.	Device for executing the method of claims  1  to 8, wherein said warp<br>
frame (4,15) consists of at least two shafts (5,6) that are facing each<br>
other and having means (31/32) thereon for holding said layer of warp<br>
threads.<br>
10   Device according to claim 9,   including two bridges  (7,8)  for holding said shafts (5,6) at a fixed distance.<br>
11.	Device according  to claim 9,   including means  for  moving  said shafts<br>
(5,6) between a distance defining a limited length and a shorter distan<br>
ce.<br>
12.	Device  according  to claim  9,   wherein at  least one  of said  shafts  is<br>
formed as a rotatable cylinder (37,38).<br>
13.	Method   for   manufacturing   a   woven   fabric   substantially   as   herein<br>
described  with  reference  to  and  as  illustrated  by the  accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
