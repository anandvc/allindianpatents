REINFORCED CONCRETE ELEMENT<br>
Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a reinforced  concrete element<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Reinforced concrete elements are generally used as building construction material for walls and slabs.<br>
The predominant techniques used in reinfoiced concrete  construction  are mostfy based on previously set models. The technical research on reinforced concrete as a building construction  materil<br>
performance. Most of the applications in the field utilise heavy eqaipment, extensive amounts of formwork or a combination of both. Advanced technical know how is required but may not be readily available. All of these  factor result  in prohibitive or redundant costs.<br>
Unfortunately, reinforced concrete is expensive. These costs are due to factors such as: cost of technical expertise  cost of design  supervison  and stilled labour; cost of materials and material handling; equipment  and labour formwork and related  labour construction time.<br>
It would therefore be desirable to have a reinforced concrete element  which is designed such mat it maximises me benefits of the material and concurrently reduces costs.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is an object of me present invention to overcome or ameliorate some of the disadvantages of the prior art or at feast to provide a useful alternative.<br>

Detalled  Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
in Figures 1A, 11 to 1J and 2 there is depicted a preferred elongate pre-cast concrete element 5. The element 5 has longitudinally extending upper and lower generally parallel surfaces 10,15 mat enable the elements 5 to be stacked as shown, for example, in Figures 1I to 1J vertically to form a wall The element S farther includes longitttdinally exteading convex<br>
1S to define a cross-section 17. A longitudinal passage 25 is located centrally and extends between end surfaces 12,13 and is adapted for receipt for a  reinforcing element such as  reinforced steel bar 30,<br>
The convex sides 20 are designed to provide excellent load bearing capabilities: The preferred cross section 17 of the element 5 has dimensions 64 mm high and 75mm wide resulting in a cross sectional area 17 of the element 5 of 4170  square millimetres. The length of the element 5 can be any length, but generally between 100mm and 5OO mm Advantageously, the width and height of the cross section 17 can be varied to suite the required increase or decrease in the bearing capacity of fee element 5. Accosdingly, construction  using the element <br>
element cross sectional dimensions and its bearing capacity, with  the only  constant  being the cross sectional design 17. These  can   be determined by the following<br>
4<br><br>
Structural Parameters And Analysis Of The element  Under DIFFERENT <br>
Conditions<br>
The design of the element 5 considers  the  loads  and stresses from the following<br>
•	Fidlscrvkx loading in its permanent location<br>
The element is deigned utilising the requirements of the ACI-318 code of practice.<br>
The reinforcement percentage in the  section is calculated as per the following equation:<br><br>
Deflection limitations as governed by the limits stipulated in ACI-318 Code of Practice, Chapter 9. Other criteria like general detailing, cover to reinforcement etc. are as per ACI-318, Chapter 7. Local code requirements can be implemented keeping the ACI requirements  as  the  minnnum acceptable.<br>
Notes:<br>
•	"a   is the  upper and lower flat surfaces 10,15 dimeasion  of the element 5.<br>
•	"As" is the area of steel section used m  reinforcement  30 of the  element 5.<br>
•	"d" is the direction from the bottom of steel reinforcement  30 to  the element upper surface 10.<br>
A number of structural design tables have been formulated to provide<br>
alternatives of cross sectional dimensions, reinforcement, lengths and load bearing<br>
capacity. The tables located herein on pages 12 to 16 enable  the user to choose the<br>
optimum dimensions   of  cross section 17 and the lenght of the element 5. 	From the<br>
tables it can be seen mat the linear metre weight of a single dement, the load bearing<br>
5<br><br>
capacity, the square metre cost are prime factor  dictating  the  choice  of  the  required dimensions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, steel  bars 30  can be  used  for  the  reinforcement of the element 5. The diameter of the steel bets 30 and passage 12mm  depending on the  desired length of the bar and the required beraring capacity.in <br>
mechanised production pre-stressed steel reinforcement can be  used. in which case the span and bearing capacity of the element can be increased  without any  addition in the raw material.<br>
Toe elements are preferably able to be handled without the need for heavy equipment The following table is based on a specific gravity of 2350 kg/cubic meter and illustrates the weights per length of a preferred form of the elements.<br><br>
Length	Weight in kg<br>
0.50 rotter long	04.90<br>
1.00 meter long	09.80<br>
130 meter long	13.70<br>
2.00 meter long	18.60<br>
2.50 meter long	2430<br>
3.00 meter long	29.40<br>

4.00 meter Jang	39.20<br>
450 meter long	44.10<br>
5.00 meter long	49.00<br>
These elements also preferably have crushing  strengths  varying  between 25 K e.g. for walls to 40 K as in roof slabs. In  this regard, th  physical characteristics of tbe ingredients; sand, gravel, cement, water and the weather temperature are basic contributors to the mix. hi most cases, the crashing strength of the concrete will be the decisive fector in identifying the various proportions of the mix.

Turning now to the mode of production of the element 5, manual and mechanised methods are presently contemplated The manual production is well suited for a limited production of the elements. For an individual, wishing to construct his/her own home unit, the means and the process of production are dependent upon moulds 40, shown in Figures 1C and  ID and are made out of material that allows multiple use and..<br>
minimal deterioration<br>
Elements 5 could be produced as fellows: procurement or fabrication of moulds<br>
40; arranging moulds in batteries; placing reinforcement steel 30; mixing of concrete;<br>
placing concrete in the mould 40 and vibrating as per standards; casting the reinforced<br>
concrete; curing and storing. As preferably, the invention is intended to minimise the cost<br>
of reinforced concrete elements, it is important  that the mould material is obtainable and<br>
that  moulds  fabricated  from  such  material can be readily used without deterioration. 	The<br>
most suitable materials found for the purpose are GRC or GRP or PVC or Polyethylene moulds cast to the form. The PVC or Polyethylene moulds are made in one piece and<br>
7<br><br>
because the mould material is flexible, ft allows casting of formwork without  disturbing 1he moulds and/or the elements and easy  removal of the mould after use.<br>
Generally, moulds 40 ate arranged on specially prepared level casting flows,<br>
reinmforcemen is set  in position concrete  is mixed and then cast into the mouids 	Small<br>
size vibrators  may be used to vibrate the concrete- The concrete should be retained in the moulds for a period of about threee days, during  which  time the concrete will be cured. The elements could men be removed from the  moulds and stacked for future use. The moulds can then be rearranged for another cast.<br>
If reinforcement is  required the  steel bars are laid in the mould and suspended in <br>
the  required  postion  by means of thin tie wires (not shown )or other suitable means .	The<br>
wires keep the reinforcement  bars  properly positioned while the concrete mix is poured.<br>
The  reinforcement  bar  should protrude beyond the ends of the moulds 	The reinforcing<br>
could  also be added later  by  casting a  recess  as in  the  preferred embodiment<br>
Another presently contemplated mode of production is  the mechanised mode<br>
where the elements  are produced on mass in a factory. Any practical  length and width  is<br>
possible only being limited by the length awl width of the machines  and  the casting bed<br>
The factory set up can  be similar to the producation line of hollow core slabs .	The same<br>
prmcipies of  mixing  handling and casting of concrete appiy .	That  is, it  can be a concrete<br>
extrusion operation. The reinforcement bars for the elements can be eimer normal tension bars or pre-stressed bars. In the preferred emboditment of this invention normal reinforcement bar are used. In the case of mass production for wide scale commercial purposes, the elements can be produced in  slabs of various widths  and  lengths. The slabs can range from 1 metre in length up to 5 metres and the width is anywhere between 0.6 metre wide up to 2 metres wide. AH dimensions  will  generally be  limited only by the  deflection allowable in relation to the length of the slabs. The elements can be stacked in a storage  yard  and sold on order. Tins allows spontaneous delivery of required material thus contributing to substantial reduction  of construction time.<br>
There are two main  uses presently contemplate for the element 5:constructing walls 50 and structural slabs 55.in the  first  case, and as  shown  Figures 1H to  1J, the elements 5 can be assembled win or without mortar/cement 45, depending on me final treatment of the walls  50. For the slabs 55, .as shown in Figure1G.the elements 5 can be buitt on structural fames 57 and either cast in place, pre-cast or a steel frame. After arranging the elements 5 in place, a concrete topping 59 (see Figures 3 and 4) could be<br><br>
poured to the thickness required. Further, as shown in Figures IB and 1G the upper surface may be rounded 60.<br>
As shown in Figures 1H to l J, when constructing  wall  50 the elements  5 stacked<br>
vertically, with or without mortar 45. The element 5 can be restrained on both hoiizontal<br>
end  by  concrete   columns  65 as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The elements 5 are then  laid<br>
there  between, either dry or with mortan 45 one top of the other .	In tins arrangement,<br>
the upper surface 10 on top of  the  element 5 with lact as  a base for the following element 5. Dry construction of the dements 5 in walls 50 will usually include plaster 62 on the outside in order to weather tighten the walls 50. Further, casting the concrete framing columns 65 on site after building the elements 5 will allow an integral structural bonding between the dements 5 and te frame. This adds substantial structural rigidity to die building frame. If, however, the columns 65 are built in situ ahead of the elements 5, tiien the dements 5 will  have to be bonded to the 65 by means of morter 45.Enough<br>
space for this procedure can be provided by placing a pre-moulded groove 69 in the column to allow  for  the  bonding  mortar.<br>
In embodiments  includmg housing constraction,  windows  70  may  be  opened  in the wall 50 simply by casting the dements  5 to the specific  dimensions  required  to  allow the window opening to be formed. The dements can be cut to size on site or better pre¬fabricated to the required lengths. No special framing system is required  for  the windows and no lintels will be needed. The dements once plastered will produce the required window frame thickness. Depending on the insulation standards required for die building, the necessary insolation material is constructed. Altemativdy if the insulation of the exterior is not required, the  inner face may be left  without  any  treatment  and/or may be plastered to produce a good internal finish face with plaster and paint as per die -standard practice. Depending upon the design requinrements, the exterior walls can be clad with  marble, stone, granite, bricks or can be plastered and painted.<br>
It is also foreshadowed thah elements can be used as internal partitions too. Farther, about 15 millimetres of plaster  on each side of the  partition will produce a 100 mm  thick  partition wall.<br>
If considering structural slabs 55, as shown in Figures IE to lG   based  on  the slab plans and the finishing  beneath  the slabs the length and the reinforcement of the elements <br>
5 are decided; all fabrication of the dements should be to the pre-designed, required length. Moreover, cutting the elements to the  required  length  on  site  is  easy and can be achieved by means of an electric disc saw. The elements 5 are laid horizontally to the full<br><br>
lengm and width of the slab area. If the clear span between the two end supports of the element is more man 2.5 metres, an intermediary support should be temporarily provided until the plain concrete slab topping 59 o f the elements 5 is poured and cored.<br>
Further to the above, the elements 5 can be used in fencing  posts and runners; warehouse wall closure; warehouse roof trusses; shoring panels closing between vertical structural supports; pavements substructures; and fruit trees groves and vineyards, however, they are not limited to only these uses.<br>
As cost is important in the construction industry the following table and figures draw a comparative analysis between the elements of the present invention at least in a preferred embodiment and other concrete products, emphasising the economic implications.<br>

10<br><br>
Upon analysis of the  above table it can be seta that, walls constructed using the elememts cf the  present  invention cost  61,60% of the standard 100mm thick sand cement blocks and slabs  cost 42.37% of the standard I20mm  thick reinforced concrete slabs.<br>
The cost analysis of one cubic meter displayed in the table (cost is calculated on basis of Kuwait market prices) was calculated as follows:<br>
Concrete material	$ 42.00<br>
Reinforced steel 55 kg.@$249/MetricTon	$  13.69<br>
Allow for casting, curing and transport to site	$  15.00<br>
Allow for site handling and construction in walls       $ 15.00<br>
Sub-total cost/cubic Metre:	$  85. 69<br>
Add 25% for overhead and profit	S 21.42<br>
Total cost/cubic metre	$107.20.<br>
Further differences wits the present invention is that normal block work construction is a "wet"  trade whilst the present invention is a "dry" trade. This minimises the messiness on sites and will save on water consumption. Most block work requires plastering. The elements of the present invention can stay without plaster on the interior, for example, when providing for low cost housing, and still maintain an aesthetically acceptable took. Further, block work requires seven days coring time before it is allowed to be plastered whilst the elements can be plastered instantly. Still further, the transportation and mechanical handling costs are also reduced when simply considering that light and less material will be transported.<br>
Further, when constructing slabs the labour rate for carpenters forming slabs is estimated at a minimum of US$42.80 per cubic metre and this is eliminated with the elements of the present invention. The need for wood and other sundries for formwork at US$18 per cubic metre is also preferabyl eliminated. A mimum of 30% of the concrete used in similar span solid slabs will be reduced by one third, yieldmg  a saving in concrete quantity and in reinforcement of US$35.00/cubic metre. Total direct saving of labour, formwork and the reduction in quantities in slab concrete and reinforcement steel is US$95.80. This will  produce a yield saving of  apiroximatefy 64% of the prevailing cost of cubic metre of concrete of me classical slab system.<br>
Is considezstics of the substantial direct savings mentioned above, there is an indirect saving effect that results from the reduction in the concrete and  reinforcement quantities and the dead load. A proportional reduction to the foundation and the framing structure will result form the climination of deal weight on wall and on salbs .This  will<br>
11<br><br>
yield a mimimm saving of 25% of die concrete and reinforcement value  for the foundations and the  framing of the structure. It is contemplated that there would be US$15.00 per cubicmetre in the foundation and  me framing system.<br>
As reinforced concrete is globally considered one of the most utilised material in the construction industry and is also expensive to acquire in its final form, people hi die low-income bracket would be substantially advantaged to use such  a product<br>
The element of the present invention is directed towards a segment of die world"s population by giving them a cost-effective and economically viable solution in order to address die cost issues and the difficulties involved in advanced technology. It does not eliminate all the problems but makes the solution much more attainable by die end user, it provides a standard solution to the construction of walls and slabs in any standard structure and in particular modular structures. The fact that the formwork for slabs, and in many parts of the world for wall construction, is relatively eliminated, a major saving on the use of wood for concrete construction purposes is achieved. This, on its  own  merit,  will  reflect positively  on  the  issue  of world forestry depletion.<br>
Although die invention has been described with reference to specific examples would be appreciated by those skilled in the ait that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.<br>
