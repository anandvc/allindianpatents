				<td>A SCREW CONVEYOR FOR A DECANTER CENTRIFUGE<br>
The present invention relates to a screw conveyor intended and formed<br>
for use in a decanter centrifuge for separation of solid particles from a<br>
fluid compound, in which such particles are suspended in a liquid having<br>
a smaller density than the particles, the decanter centrifuge comprising<br>
-	a rotor, which has an inlet for said compound, an outlet for separated<br>
solid particles and an outlet for liquid having been freed from solid par-<br>
ticles, and which rotor is rotatable about a rotational axis at a first velocity,<br>
and<br>
-	a screw conveyor, which is arranged in the rotor and is rotatabte about<br>
the rotational axis at a second velocity different from the first velocity,<br>
the screw conveyor comprising<br>
â€¢ a central body, which extends along the rotational axis,<br>
-	at least one conveyor thread, which extends like a screw thread along<br>
and about the central body and is supported by the same such that a<br>
screw shaped flow path is formed around the body, and<br>
-	at least one baffle, which bridges said flow path between different parts<br>
of the conveyor thread to prevent free movement of liquid and solid par-<br>
ticles along the flow path towards said outlet for solid particles.<br>
A screw conveyor of this kind is described in US 3 885 734 and in<br>
US 3 934 792.<br>
In a screw conveyor according to US 3 885 734 the above mentioned<br>
baffle has the form of an annular disc arranged in a plane substantially<br>
perpendicular to the rotational axis.<br>
In a screw conveyor according to US 3 934 792, on the other hand, the<br>
baffle is arranged between two adjacent parts of the conveyor thread,<br><br>
extending substantially radially and axially with respect to said rotational<br>
axis.<br>
Also WO 99/65610 shows a screw conveyor of the initially defined kind.<br>
Traditionally, screw conveyors for decanter centrifuges have been manu-<br>
factured out of metal, a strip of sheet metal having been formed into a<br>
screw thread and been welded along its radially inner screw-formed edge<br>
onto the central body. When desired a baffle of the kind defined above<br>
has been welded to the screw thread and possibly even to the central<br>
body.<br>
In WO 99/65610 it is mentioned that the rotor and the screw conveyor<br>
may be formed of several parts, being releasably connected to each other<br>
(page 22) and also that the screw conveyor may be manufactured in one<br>
piece of plastic (page 15). However, it is not mentioned more precisely<br>
any method for manufacturing of a screw conveyor. A general method for<br>
manufacturing of plastic details is injection moulding. However, this me-<br>
thod appears not to be appropriate for any of the embodiments of the<br>
screw conveyor as shown in WO 99/65610. Thus, it does not appear to<br>
be possible to remove an injection-moulded screw conveyor from the<br>
mould by screwing it out thereof.<br>
Also in US 5 800 332 there is shown a decanter centrifuge, in which the<br>
rotor and the screw conveyor may be formed of several parts being<br>
releasably connected to each other.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a construction for a screw<br>
conveyor, which construction makes possible a simple manufacture of the<br>
screw conveyor - even if it is to be made of plastic - ensures transport-<br><br>
ation of solid particles in the rotor past said baffle and gives a required<br>
sttffness and strength to the conveyor thread in an area where it inter-<br>
sects with the baffle.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a construction for a<br>
screw conveyor, which makes possible simple assembly of the screw<br>
conveyor.<br>
According to the invention these objects may be obtained by means of a<br>
screw conveyor of the initially defined kind, in which<br>
-	the screw conveyor comprises at least two originally separate parts,<br>
each of which comprises a portion of said conveyor thread and which are<br>
kept together axially,<br>
-	said baffle constitutes a separate member arranged to be kept in place<br>
between said parts of the screw conveyor, when these are kept together<br>
axially, and<br>
-	the separate member has a portion, which forms a part of the conveyor<br>
thread in an area where the conveyor thread intersects with and extends<br>
past the baffle.<br>
By the invention the different parts of the screw conveyor and said baffle<br>
may be manufactured each for itself. If the screw conveyor will be made<br>
of plastic, the different parts may be formed so that injection-moulding<br>
technique may be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention said separate member is<br>
arranged to be kept in place by said parts of the screw conveyor, when<br>
these are kept together axially. Furthermore, said parts of the screw con-<br>
veyor are detachably connected to each other. This makes possible easy<br>
exchange of said baffle, e.g. if it would appear that it has a size which is<br><br>
not optimal for the separation process, in which the decanter centrifuge in<br>
question will be used. If required said baffle may be changed as a result<br>
of wear, for example.<br>
Preferably, each of the parts of the screw conveyor also comprises a part<br>
of the central body. In that case, each of the parts of the central body is<br>
suitably provided with a substantially cylindrical portion having axial ribs<br>
and grooves, one of the parts having internal ribs and grooves and an-<br>
other of the parts having external ribs and grooves, arranged to keep the<br>
different parts of the screw conveyor drivingly coupled together. The parts<br>
are arranged to be kept axially together by means of a member, which<br>
extends axially within the central body. Hereby, each of the parts may be<br>
easily exchanged, if required.<br>
The invention is not limited to the screw conveyor comprising only one<br>
conveyor thread and only one baffle. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention the screw conveyor comprises two conveyor threads extending<br>
like screw threads along and about the central body and being supported<br>
by the same such that two screw shaped flow paths are formed around<br>
the body. Furthermore, the screw conveyor comprises a baffle of the de-<br>
fined kind for each of said flow paths, the baffles bridging the respective<br>
flow paths between different sections of the conveyor threads to prevent<br>
free movement of liquid and solid particles along the flow paths towards<br>
said outlet for solid particles. In a screw conveyor with two conveyor thre-<br>
ads an improved balance is obtained in the screw conveyor, providing im-<br>
proved operation characteristics for the decanter centrifuge.<br>
In the case the screw conveyor has two baffles of the defined kind these<br>
may be formed as one single member arranged to bridge said two flow<br>
paths and to be kept in place between said two parts of the screw con-<br><br>
veyor. Each of the baffles may be formed as in either US 3 885 734 or<br>
US 3 934 792.<br>
in a particular embodiment of the invention said single member may have<br>
substantially the form of an annular disc having two diametrically opposed<br>
portions, of which one portion forms a part of one of said conveyor thre-<br>
ads and the other portion forms a part of the other one of said conveyor<br>
threads. Then, the annular disc may comprise two additional diametrically<br>
opposed portions, each forming one of said two baffles, which bridge the<br>
respective two screw-shaped flow paths.-In this case the two baffles are<br>
formed as can be seen in US 3 885 734.<br>
The invention is to be further described in the following with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawing, in which<br>
Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal section of a decanter centrifuge comprising a<br>
rotor and a screw conveyor, an annular disc being kept between two<br>
parts of the screw conveyor, coupled together,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a section of the screw conveyor according to Fig. 1 in a<br>
larger scale, said parts of the screw conveyor being situated at some<br>
axial distance from each other, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows the annular disc in a larger scale and in perspective.<br>
In figure 1 there is shown a decanter centrifuge comprising a rotor 1,<br>
which is rotatable at a certain velocity about a vertical rotational axis R,<br>
and a screw conveyor 2 arranged in the rotor 1 and rotatable about the<br>
same rotational axis R, though with a velocity differing from that of the<br>
rotor 1. The decanter centrifuge is intended to be suspended vertically in<br><br>
a way as shown in WO 99/65610. Therefore, the necessary arrangement<br>
for suspension and driving of the decanter centrifuge is not described<br>
herein.<br>
 The rotor 1 has a substantially cylindrical upper rotor part 3 comprising or<br>
being connected to a hollow rotor shaft 4, and a substantially conical<br>
lower rotor part 5. The rotor part 3 and the rotor shaft 4 are connected to<br>
each other by means of screws (not shown). Of course, alternative con-<br>
nection members may be used. The rotor parts 3 and 5 may be formed<br>
as two separate parts being releasably connected with each other e.g. by<br>
means of screws (not shown).<br>
The rotor 1 has several outlets 6 for liquid at its upper end and a centrally<br>
and axially directed outlet 7 for sludge at its lower part. In the area of the<br>
liquid Outlets 6, somewhat below these, a ring 8 is arranged, which forms<br>
an overflow outlet for liquid in the rotor flowing towards and out through<br>
the outlets 6. The ring 8 is arranged to maintain a free liquid surface in<br>
the rotor 1 at a radial level 9. The ring 8 is releasably arranged, which<br>
gives the possibility to choose rings with different inner diameter so that<br>
the radial level 9 may be changed.<br>
As can be seen from figure 1 the screw conveyor comprises a central<br>
body 10, which extends along the rotational axis R, two conveyor threads<br>
11a and 11b, respectively, which extend like screw threads along and<br>
about the central body 10, and a disc 12, which extends perpendicular to<br>
the rotational axis R from the central body 10 in a direction towards the<br>
surrounding rotor part 3. The disc 12 bridges said two flow paths from a<br>
radial level at a first distance from the rotational axis R, in this case from<br>
the central body 10, o a radial level at a second larger distance from the<br>
rotational axis R, the second larger distance being smaller than the dis-<br><br>
tance between the rotational axis R and the circumferential parts of the<br>
conveyor threads 11a and 11b, respectively, in the area of the disc 12.<br>
Hereby, a gap 12a is formed between the circumferential part of the disc<br>
12 and the rotor part 3, said gap extending about the rotational axis R<br>
except in two areas in which the gap is filled out by the conveyor threads<br>
11a and 11b.<br>
A hollow shaft 13 extends from above into the rotor 1 through the interior<br>
of the rotor axis 4 and supports the central body within the rotor. A sta-<br>
tionary inlet pipe 14 intended for a liquid compound to be treated in the<br>
rotor 1 extends through the shaft 13. The inlet pipe 14 opens in a first<br>
space 15 in the central body 10. The first space 15 is delimited at its<br>
lower axial end by a partition 16, which prevents the liquid compound<br>
from flowing further downwards within the central body 10. At its upper<br>
axial end the space 15 is delimited by a cone-shaped member 17. The<br>
cone-shaped member 17 is arranged such that a gap 18 is formed be-<br>
tween this and the inlet pipe 14. At its upper axial end the space 15<br>
communicates with a second space 19 through the gap 18. The central<br>
body 10 has one or more holes 20 connecting the first space 15 with the<br>
separation chamber of the rotor 1, which is formed between the central<br>
body 10 and the surrounding rotor part 3 above said disc 12. The central<br>
body 10 also has one or more holes 21 connecting the second space 19<br>
with said separation chamber of the rotor 1.<br>
The central body 10 comprises two parts; a first upper part 22 and a se-<br>
cond lower part 23. The parts are releasably connected with each other<br>
and for this purpose the lower part 23 has a substantially cylindrical por-<br>
tion 24, which on its outside has axialiy running ribs and grooves, which<br>
are in engagement with similar ribs and grooves formed on the inside of a<br>
likewise substantially cylindrical portion 25 of the upper part 22 of the<br><br>
central body 10. The two parts 22 and 23 of the centra! body 10 are thus<br>
drivingly connected to each other.<br>
The annular disc 12 (see figure 3) comprises two diametrically opposed<br>
i portions 26 and 27, of which one portion 26 forms a part of the conveyor<br>
thread 11a and the other portion 27 forms a part of the conveyor thread<br>
11 b. Furthermore, the disc 12 comprises two diametrically opposed ad-<br>
ditional portions 28a and 28b, each of which forms one of two baffles<br>
bridging the respective (two) screw-shaped flow paths, which are formed<br>
between the conveyor threads 11a and 11b.<br>
As indicated in figure 2 the different parts 22 and 23 of the screw con-<br>
veyor may be coupled together by being brought axially towards each<br>
other. Then the annular disc 12 is placed between the parts 22 and 23<br>
and is kept in place by these parts when they are coupled together.<br>
After the coupling of the parts 22 and 23 together they are kept axially<br>
together by means of a bar 29 arranged within the central body 10 (see<br>
figure 1). The bar 29 extends from the space 15 through the partition 16<br>
and further axially through the whole of the lower part 23 of the body 10.<br>
Mounted in the way mentioned above a screw conveyor 2 is obtained<br>
having two flow paths, which are delimited by and between the conveyor<br>
threads 11a and 11b extending like screw threads side by side along and<br>
about the central body 10. Said disc 12 bridges the flow paths to prevent<br>
liquid from flowing along these towards the.outlet 7. What may by-pass<br>
the disc 12 downwards is only sludge, which has been separated from<br>
the compound entering through the inlet pipe 14 and which is supplied<br>
axially by the conveyor threads 11a and 11b along the inside of the rotor<br>
part 3 through the gap 12a between the disc 12 and the rotor part 3.<br><br>
