ULTRASONIC SURGICAL INSTRUMENT INCORPORATING FLUID<br>
MANAGEMENT<br>
Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
	[0001] The present application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. patent<br>
	application no. 09/826,070 filed on April 4, 2001 entitled "Blades with Functional<br>
	Balance Asymmetries tor Use with Ultrasonic Surgical Instruments' and further<br>
	claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application serial no.<br>
	60/412,845, filed on September 23, 2002, both of which are incorporated by<br>
	reference in their entirety herein.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to an ultrasonic surgical instrument for cutting,<br>
	coagulating, grasping and blunt-dissecting tissue, and particularly relates to an<br>
	ultrasonic surgical instrument having a port or lumen tor providing fluid, vapor<br>
	and/or debris management, such as, suction or irrigation to the surgical site. The<br>
	present invention is, in one embodiment, specifically adapted for endoscopic<br>
	surgery, although, it has other medical applications as well.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
	[0003] The prior art often features a suction system located at the distal end of an<br>
	ultrasonic phacoemulsifier. This allows for suction/irrigation, but a problem exists<br>
	in that the fluid suctioned or expelled from the ultrasonic phacoemulsifier is<br>
	heated due to its direct contact with the ultrasonic blade. Fluids that come in<br>
	direct contact with the ultrasonic blade cause a substantial heat reduction making<br>
	the cauterization feature of the instrument less effective. The fluid in direct<br>
	contact with the ultrasonic blade causes a decrease in the available transmitted<br>
	ultrasonic energy, that is, the fluid dampens or loads the blade system requiring<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
-2-<br>
	more input power to achieve the desired tissue elfect. In addition, the tissue<br>
	and/or fluids being transmitted through the blade cavity tend to accumulate at the<br>
	nodes of the blade. This accumulation creates a blockage within the blade,<br>
	which results in a reduced flow situation and even more power loss due to blade<br>
	loading.<br>
	[0004] There is a need for an ultrasonic surgical device with suction and/or irrigation<br>
	capabilities in which the suction/irrigation does not increase (due to, for example,<br>
	loading of the blade system due to a collection of debris) or decrease (due to, for<br>
	example, convective cooling) the heat emissions of the blade nor decrease the<br>
	net power of the blade available to do work. A need is also present for an<br>
	ultrasonic surgical device to effectively eliminate debris, which is known to collect<br>
	at or near the nodes (longitudinal, torsional and/or transverse - modes or motion)<br>
	of ultrasonic blades. In addition, a need is present to eliminate vapor from the<br>
	ultrasonic transactions to allow for increased visibility for the clinical user.<br>
	[000,5] The present invention addresses the deficiencies of the prior art and provides an<br>
	ultrasonic surgical instrument that is useful in both open and endoscopic surgical<br>
	applications in addition to robotic-assisted surgeries.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
	[0006] The present invention provides for an ultrasonic surgical device having a<br>
	distally/proxirnally movable fluid management system consisting of single lumen<br>
	or multiple lumens, which is positioned so as to minimally contact the ultrasonic<br>
	blade. The invention provides for means of controlled delivery/ removal of fluids,<br>
	debris or vapor to and/or from the tissue effecting portion of the blade while<br>
	minimizing the loading on the blade. The blades in the preferred embodiment<br>
	are non-axisymmetric in at least one plane and have modal shapes at a given<br>
	natural excitation frequency characterized try longitudinal, transverse, and/or<br>
	torsional motion patterns where at least one nodal point along the tissue effecting<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
-3-<br>
	portion of the blade exists and is defined by a minimum (approximately zero)<br>
	vibratory motion of the blade in a direction and at least one antinodal position<br>
	exists along the tissue effecting portion (for example, at the distal tip) where the<br>
	motion in the same direction is a maximum. This invention can also be used with<br>
	axisymmetric blades that propagate vibratory motion in any of the<br>
	aforementioned forms (longitudinal, transverse, and torsional) or combinations<br>
	thereof wherein at least one motion nodal point is available for effecting tissue.<br>
	The preferred instrument is designed to allow for the fluid management system to<br>
	be positioned at one or more transverse (mode or motion) node to facilitate<br>
	efficient removal of tissue or fluid, which tends to accumulate at such nodes of<br>
	non-axisymmetric ultrasonic surgical blades.<br>
	[0007] It is Known that during ultrasonic surgical procedures fluid and tissue<br>
	accumulates at the nodes (longitudinal, transverse, and torsional- modes or<br>
	motion). The present invention takes advantage of this phenomenon by utilizing<br>
	a movable single lumen or movable multiple lumens, which may be placed for<br>
	suction/irrigation at any of the nodes contained within the working portion of the<br>
	end-effector. It may also be beneficial for the surgeon to have the ability to<br>
	position the lumen/ lumens anywhere along the working portion of the end-<br>
	effector. Less suction is therefore required to remove the tissue or particles that<br>
	have already accumulated near the nodal locations.<br>
	[0008] The present invention has the advantage of having the movable suction/irrigation<br>
	lumen/lumens located away from the ultrasonic blade. In the prior art,<br>
	instruments that have a suction system, an irrigation system, or both, in contact<br>
	with the ultrasonic blade, have several disadvantages as earlier discussed. By<br>
	locating the movable suction/irrigation lumen/lumens away from the blade, the<br>
	coagulating temperature of the blade is not decreased and the unpredictable<br>
	temperature increase of the blade that are due to tissue accumulation at the<br>
	transverse (mode or motion) nodes of the blade are eliminated. In the present<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
-4-<br>
	invertion, the ultrasonic blades may also be solid as opposed to the necessary<br>
	hollow blades seen in the prior art. This solid construction allows for better blade<br>
	strength and allows more versatility of construction and shape.<br>
	[0009] The movable suction/irrigation lumen/ lumens allows physicians to<br>
	suction/irrigate at the most optimal location. Various blades will have different<br>
	nodal (longitudinal, transverse, and torsional- rnode or motion) locations due to<br>
	the abundance of blade lengths, operating frequencies, materials, and geometry<br>
	that affect the characteristic mode shape(s) of the blade that will be excited<br>
	during use. A movable suction/irrigation lumen/lumens enables physicians to<br>
	locate the suction/irrigation system at the desired location (nodal or otherwise),<br>
	wherever that may be on a given blade.<br>
	[0010] The present invention also features the advantage of a channel located in the<br>
	tissue-effecting portion of the ultrasonic blade. Fluid and tissue, which have a<br>
	tendency to congregate at the nodal location, are more easily removed because<br>
	the channel prevents collected particles from escaping from the suction device.<br>
	The channel may also be used to direct irrigation fluid to the surgical site.<br>
	Additionally, the channel may come in contact with the lumen/lumens in order to<br>
	provide support or partially constrain the lumen. The channel may come in a<br>
	variety of embodiments such as a spoon shape, Wide curve, etc. The lumen may<br>
	also be moved proximally in order to evacuate aerosol and/or vapor from the<br>
	surgical site during the procedure.<br>
	[0011] The lumen/ lumens may also be positioned to deliver irrigation through the<br>
	device. Irrigation is, at times, beneficial to remove tissue and/or blood from the<br>
	device when the blade is active. It is also beneficial to deliver irrigation to the<br>
	surgical site in order to improve the visualization or clean the site in question. It<br>
	makes sense that the lumen/ lumens would be movable infinitely along the<br>
	working portion of the end-effector. In the case of the surgical site irrigation, it<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
-5-<br>
may be beneficial to allow movement of the lumen/ lumens beyond the distal XXX<br>
	of the blade.<br>

	The fore-bell 94 may be tapered inwardly from its proximal end to its distal end to<br>
	amplify the ultrasonic vibration amplitude as velocity transformer 64, or<br>
	alternately may have no amplification.<br>
[0029] The piezoelectric elements 100 may be fabricated from any suitable material.<br>
	such as, for example, lead zirconate-titanate, lead meta-niobate, lead titanate, or<br>
	other piezoelectric crystal material. Each of the positive electrodes 36, negative<br>
	electrodes 98, and piezoelectric elements 100 has a bore extending through the<br>
	center. The positive and negative electrodes 96 and 98 are electrically coupled<br>
	to wires 102 and 104, respectively. Wires 102 and 104 are encased within cable<br>
	25 and electrically connectable to ultrasonic signal generator 15 of ultrasonic<br>
	system 10.<br>
	[0030] Ultrasonic transducer 82 of the acoustic assembly 80 converts the electrical<br>
	signal from ultrasonic signal generator 15 into mechanical energy that results in<br>
	primarily longitudinal vibratory motion of the ultrasonic transducer 82 and an end-<br>
	number GEN01, from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, inc., Cincinnati, Ohlo. When the<br>
	acoustic assembly 80 is energized, a vibratory motion standing wave is<br>
	generated through the acoustic assembly 80. The amplitude of the vibratory<br>
	motion at any point along the acoustic assembly 80 depends on the location<br>
	along the acoustic assembly 80 at which the vibratory motion is measured. A<br>
	minimum or zero crossing in the vibratory motion standing wave is generally<br>
	referred to as a node (i.e., where motion is usually minimal), and an absolute<br>
	value maximum or peak in the standing wave is generally referred to as an anti-<br>
	node. The distance between an anti-node and its nearest node is one-quarter<br>
	wavelength (2/4).<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
9<br>
	[0031] Wires 102 and 104 transmit the electrical signal from the ultrasonic signal<br>
	generator 15 lo positive electrodes 96 and negative electrodes 98, The<br>
	piezoelectric elements 100 are energized by an electrical signal supplied from<br>
	the ultrasonic signal generator 15 in response to a foot switch 118 to produce an<br>
	acoustic standing wave in the acoustic assembly 80. The electrical signal<br>
	causes disturbances in the piezoelectric elements 100 in the form of repeated<br>
	small displacements resulting in large compression forces within the material.<br>
	The repeated small displacements cause the piezoelectric elements 100 to<br>
	expand and contract in a continuous manner along the axis of the voltage<br>
	gradient producing longitudinal waves of ultrasonic energy . The ultrasonic<br>
	energy is transmitted through the acoustic assembly 80 to the end-effector 180.<br>
	[0032] In order for the acoustic assembly 80 to deliver energy to end-effector 180, all<br>
	components of acoustic assembly 80 must be acoustically coupled to the<br>
	ultrasonically active portions of clamp coagulator 120. The distal end of the<br>
	ultrasonic transducer 82 may be acoustically coupled at surface 95 to the<br>
	proximal end of an ultrasonic waveguide 179 by a threaded connection such as<br>
	stud 50.<br>
	[0033] The components of the acoustic assembly 80 are preferably acoustically tuned<br>
	such that the lenglh of any assembly is an integral number of one-half<br>
	wavelengths (nλ /2), where the wavelength λ is the wavelength of a pre-selected<br>
	or operating longitudinal vibration drive frequency XXX of the acoustic assembly 80,<br>
	and where n is any positive integer. It is also contemplated that the acoustic<br>
	assembly 80 may incorporate any suitable arrangement of acoustic elements.<br>
	[0034] The damp coagulator 120 may include an instrument housing 130, and an<br>
	elongated member 150. The elongated member 150 can be selectively rotated<br>
	with respect lo the instrument housing 130. Located at the distal end of the outer<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
-10-<br>
	tube 160 is an end-effector 180 for performing various tasks, such as, for<br>
	example, grasping tissue, cutting tissue and the like.<br>
	[0035] End-effector 180 and its components are shown in greater detail in Figures 2<br>
	through 4. The end-effector 180 generally includes a non-vibrating clamp arm<br>
	assembly 300 to, for example, grip tissue or compress tissue against the<br>
	ultrasonic blade 88. The end-effector 180 is illustrated In Figs. 2 and 4 in a<br>
	damp open position, and clamp arm assembly 300 is preferably pivotally<br>
	attached to the distal end of the outer tube 160. The clamp arm 202 has tissue<br>
	pad 208 with serrations 210 attached thereto for squeezing tissue between the<br>
	ultrasonic blade 88 and clamp arm assembly 300.<br>
	[0036] The distal end of the tubular member 174 of the inner tube 170 preferably<br>
	includes a finger or flange 171 that extends therefrom. The flange 171 has an<br>
	opening 173A and an opening 173B (not shown) to receive the first post 206A<br>
	and second post 2068 of the clamp arm 202. When the inner tube 170 of the<br>
	eiongated member 150 is moved axially, the flange 171 moves forwardly or<br>
	rearwardly while engaging the first post 206A and second post 206B of the clamp<br>
	arm assembly 300 to open and close the clamp arm 202.<br>
	[0037] The ultrasonic waveguide 179 of the elongated member 150 extends through<br>
	aperture 175 of the inner tube 170. The ultrasonic waveguide 179 is preferably<br>
	substantially semi-flexible. It will be recognized that the ultrasonic waveguide<br>
	179 may be substantially rigid or may be a flexible wire. Ultrasonic vibrations are<br>
	transmitted along the ultrasonic waveguide 179 in a longitudinal direction to<br>
	vibrate the ultrasonic blade 88.<br>
	[0038] The ultrasonic waveguide 179 may, for example, have a length substantially<br>
	equal to an integral number of one-half system wavelengths (0λ√2). The<br>
	ultrasonic waveguide 179 may be preferably fabricated from a solid core shaft<br>
	constructed out of material that propagates ultrasonic energy efficiently, such as<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
-11-<br>
	titanium alloy (i.e., Ti-6A1-4V) or an aluminum alloy. The ultrasonic waveguide<br>
	179 may also amplify the mechanical vibrations transmitted to the ultrasonic<br>
	blade 88 as is well known in the art.<br>
	[0039] The ultrasonic blade 88 may have a length substantially equal to an integral<br>
	multiple of one-half system wavelengths (0λ√2). The distal end of ultrasonic<br>
	blade 88 may be disposed near an antinode in order to provide the maximum<br>
	longitudinal excursion of the distal end. When the transducer assembly is<br>
	energized, the distal end of the ultrasonic blade 88 is configured to move in the<br>
	range of, for example, approximately 10 to 500 microns peak-to-peak, and<br>
	preferably in the range of about 30 to 150 microns at a predetermined vibrational<br>
	frequency.<br>
	[0040] The ultrasonic blade 88 is preferably made from a solid cote shaft constructed of<br>
	material which propagates ultrasonic energy, such as a titanium alloy (i.e., Ti-6AI-<br>
	4V) or an aluminum alloy and can be of various geometries. As illustrated in<br>
	Figures 3a-c and 4, the geometry of the ultrasonic blade 88 delivers ultrasonic<br>
	power more uniformly to clamped tissue than predicate devices. The end-<br>
	effector 180 provides for improved visibility of the blade tip so that a surgeon can<br>
	verify that the blade 88 extends across the structure being cut or coagulated.<br>
	This is especially important in verifying margins for large blood vessels. The<br>
	geometry also provides for improved tissue access by more closely replicating<br>
	the curvature of biological structures. Blade 88 provides a multitude of edges<br>
	and surfaces, designed to provide a multitude of tissue effects: clamped<br>
	coagulation, clamped cutting, grasping, back-cutting, dissection, spot<br>
	coagulation, tip penetration and tip scoring.<br>
	[0041] The distal most tip of blade 88 has a surface 54 perpendicular to tangent 63, a<br>
	line tangent to the curvature at the distal tip. Two fillet-like features 61A and 61B<br>
	are used to blend surfaces 51, 52 and 54, thus giving a blunt tip that can be<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
- 12-<br>
	utllized for spot coagulation. The top of the blade 88 is radiused and blunt,<br>
	providing a broad edge, or surface 56, for clamping tissues between it and clamp<br>
	arm assembly 300. Surface 56 is used for clamped cutting and coagulation as<br>
	well as manipulaling tissues while the blade is inactive.<br>
	[0042] The bottom surface has a spherical cut 53 that provides a narrow edge, or sharp<br>
	edge 55, along the bottom of blade as. The material cut is accomplished by, for<br>
	example, sweeping a spherical end mill through an arc of radius R1 and then<br>
	finishing the cut using a second, tighter radius R2 that blends the cut with a<br>
	bottom surface 58 of the blade 88. Radius R1 is preferably within the range of<br>
	0.5 inches to 2 inches, more preferably within the range ot 0.9 inches to 1.1<br>
	inches, and most preferably about 1.068 inches. Radius R2 is preferably within<br>
	the range of 0.125 inches to 0.5 inches, and most preferably about 0.25 inches.<br>
	The second radius R2 and the corresponding blend with the bottom surface 56 of<br>
	blade 88 diminishes the stress concentrated at the end of the spherical cut<br>
	relative io stopping the cut wiihout this blend. The sharp edge 55 facilitates<br>
	disseclion and unclamped cutting (back-cutting) through less vascular tissues.<br>
	[0043] Spherical cut 53 on bottom surface 58 of blade 88 creates sharp edge 55 while<br>
	removing a minimal amount of material from blade 88. Spherical cut 53 on the<br>
	bottom of blade 88 creates a sharp edge 55 with an angle of α as described<br>
	below. This angle a may be similar to predicate shears devices such as, for<br>
	example, the LCS-K5 manufactured by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati,<br>
	Ohio. However blade 88 cuts faster than predicate devices by virtue of the<br>
	orientation of the angle a with respect to the typical application force. For the<br>
	predicate shears devices, the edges are symmetric, spanning the application<br>
	force equally. The edges for the present invention are asymmetric, with the<br>
	asymmetry of the edges dictating how quickly tissue is separated or cut. The<br>
	asymmetry is important in that it provides for an effectively sharper edge when<br>
	ultrasonically activated, without removing a significant volume of material, while<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
- 13-<br>
	maintaining blunt geometry. This asymmetric angle as well as the curvature of<br>
	the blade act to self tension tissue during back-cutting utilizing a slight hook-like<br>
	or wedge-like action.<br>
	[0044] Sharp edge 55 of ultrasonic blade 88 is defined by the intersection of surface 53<br>
	and a second surface 57 left after bottom surface 58 has received spherical cut<br>
	53. Clamp arm assembly 300 is pivotally mounted on said distal end of outer<br>
	tube 160 for pivotal movement with respect to ultrasonic blade 88, for clamping<br>
	tissue between clamp arm assembly 300 and ultrasonic blade 88. Reciprocal<br>
	movement of inner tube 170 pivots clamp arm assembly 300 through an arc of<br>
	movement, defining a vertical plane 181. A tangent 60 of spherical cut 53 at<br>
	sharp edge 55 defines an angle a with a tangent 62 of second surface 57, as<br>
	illustrated in Figure 3b. The bisection 59 of angle a preferably does not lie in<br>
	vertical plane 181, but is offset by an angle β Preferably the tangent 60 of<br>
	spherical cut 53 lies within about 5 to 50 degrees of vertical plane 181, and most<br>
	preferably the tangent of spherical cut 53 lies about 38.8 degrees from vertical<br>
	plane 181. Preferably angle α is within the range of about 90 to 150 degrees,<br>
	and most preferably angle α is about 121.6 degrees.<br>
	[0045] Looking to Figure 3c, an alternate embodiment illustrated with an asymmeiric<br>
	narrow edge. A tangent 60A of a spherical cut 53A at a sharp edge 55A defines<br>
	an angle αA with a tangent 62A of a second surface 57A. as illustrated in Figure<br>
	3c. A bisection 59A of angle αA preferably does not lie in a vertical plane 181A,<br>
	but is offset by an angle βA.<br>
	[0046] The curved shape of the design of ultrasonic blade 88 also results in a more<br>
	uniformly distributed energy delivery to tissue as it is clamped against the blade<br>
	88. Uniform energy delivery is desired so that a consistent tissue effect (thermal<br>
	and transaction effect) along the length of end-effector 180 is achieved. The<br>
	distal most 15 millimeters of blade 88 is the working portion, used to achieve a<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
- 14-<br>
	tissue effect. As will be further described below. the displacement vectors for<br>
	locations along the curved shears blade 88 have directions that, by virtue of the<br>
	Improvements of the present invention over predicate instruments, lie largely in the<br>
	x-y plane illustrated in Figures 3a-c. The motion, therefore, of blade 88 lies within<br>
	a plane (the x-y plane) that is perpendicular to the direction of the clamping fares<br>
	from clamp arm assembly 300.<br>
	[0047] Straight symmetric ultrasonic Glades in general have tip excursions that lie along<br>
	the longitudinal avis, designated the x-axis in Figures 3a-c. Transverse motion is<br>
	usually undesirable because it results in undesirable heat generation in inner<br>
	tube 170. When a functional asymmetry is added to an ultrasonic blade, such as<br>
	a curved end-effector as described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
	09/106,686 incorporated herein by reference, the functional asymmetry creates<br>
	an imbalance in the ultrasonic waveguide. If the imbalance is not corrected, then<br>
	undesirable heat, noise, and compromised tissue effect occur. Although U.S.<br>
	Patent Application Serial No. 09/106,686 teaches how to provide ultrasonic<br>
	blades that are balanced proximal to the balance asymmetry, the distal portion of<br>
	the end-effector has an excursion in at least two axes. If the end-effector has a<br>
	single plane of functional asymmetry, such as a curved end-effector, but the<br>
	blade is otherwise symmetric, then the excursion will lie in a plane at the distal<br>
	most end.<br>
	[0048] It is often desirable to minimize any ultrasonic blade 38 excursion in the z-axis<br>
	direction. Excursion of ultrasonic blade 88 In the z-axis direction causes system<br>
	inefficiencies, resulting in undesirable heating, power loss, and possibly noise.<br>
	Excursion of ultrasonic blade 88 in the Z-axis direction at end-effector 180 causes<br>
	the ultrasonic blade 38 to impact tissue lying between ultrasonic blade 88 and<br>
	clamp arm assembly 300. It is desirable to limit ultrasonic blade 88 excursion to<br>
	the x-y plane shown in Figures 3a-c. This allows ultrasonic blade 88 to rub tissue<br>
	lying between ultrasonic blade 38 and clamp arm assembly 300 without impact,<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
- 14-<br>
	which optimizes heating of the tissue, and thus provides optimal coagulation.<br>
	Minimizing z-axis excursion both proxirnal to the end-effector 180. and in<br>
	ultrasonic blade 88, may be accomplished by proper selection of a spherical cut<br>
	53.<br>
	[0049] However, an ultrasonic end-effector 180 with an ultrasonic blade 88 that has<br>
	multiple functional asymmetries, such as ultrasonic blade 88 as illustrated in<br>
	Figures 3-4, will nafurally have a tendency to include tip excursion In all three<br>
	axes, x, y, and z if not balanced properly. For example, ultrasonic blade 88 as<br>
	illustrated in Figure 3a is curved in the y direction at its distal end. This<br>
	curvature, although balanced proximal to end-effector 180, will cause ultrasonic<br>
	blade 88 to have excursions in both the x and y directions when activated.<br>
	Adding spherical cut 53 subsequently adds another level of asymmetry to<br>
	ultrasonic blade 88, causing tip excursion in all three axes if not corrected, and<br>
	also causing z-axis imbalances in ultrasonic waveguide 179 which decreases<br>
	efficiency.<br>
	[0050] It is possible to minimize z-axis tip excursion proximal to the functional<br>
	asymmetry, and therefore maximize efficiency with improved tissue effect, by<br>
	providing a functional asymrnetry optimized to minimize z-axis excursion in<br>
	ultrasonic waveguide 179. As illustrated in Figure 3, spherical cut 53 may extend<br>
	proximaily into ultrasonic blade 88, from the most distal end, to any position. For<br>
	example, Figure 3 illustrates a first position 66, a second position 67, and a third<br>
	position 68, for spherical cut 53 to extend Into ultrasonic blade 88.<br>
	[0051] Table 1 below describes three possible lengths of spherical cuts 53 for ultrasonic<br>
	blade 88 illustrated in Figure 3 as first position 66, second position 67, and third<br>
	position 68. The rows of Table 1 correspond to the length of cut into the<br>
	ultrasonic blade 88, and the columns of Table 1 correspond to the balance<br>
	condition and excursions along each axis for each cut length. It can be<br><br>
WO 2004/026104	PCT/US2003/029474<br>
- 16-<br>
	appreciated from Table 1 that providing spherical cut 53 to a length<br>
	corresponding to first position 68 minimizes the z axis excursion proximal to the<br>
	functional asymmetry. It is preferable to balance ultrasonic blade 88 below 15 %<br>
	z axis excursion proximal to the functional asymmetry and it is most preferable to<br>
	balance ultrasonic blade 88 below 5% z axis excursion proximal to the functional<br>
	asymmetry. Preferably clamp coagulator 120 is designed to oe balanced when<br>
	activated in air (loaded only by air), and then balance is verified under other load<br>
	conditions.<br>
	[0052] In Table 1, a normalized excursion percentage (% z) in a clamping instrument at<br>
	the end-effector 88 is calculated by taking the magnitude of the excursion in the<br>
	direction normal to the clamp arm when the clamp arm is in its fully closed<br>
	position, and dividing that magnitude by the magnitude of the maximum tip<br>
	vibration excursion (also called the primary tip vibration excursion), and then<br>
	multiplying the dividend by one hundred. Primary tip vibration excursion is the<br>
	magnitude of the major axis of the ellipse or ellipsold created by a point on the<br>
	distal most end of ultrasonic blade 88 when the ultrasonic blade 88 is activated.<br>
	The measurement of excursions is more fully explained in IEC international<br>
	standard 61847, titled Measurement and Declaration of the Basic Output<br>
	Characteristics of ultrasonic surgical systems, hereby incorporated herein by<br>
	reference. A normalized excursion percentage (%x, %y, %z) in ultrasonic blade<br>
	88 or ultrasonic waveguide 179 is calculated by taking the magnitude of a<br>
	secondary vibration excursion, and dividing that magnitude by the magnitude of<br>
	the primary tip vibration excursion, and then multiplying the dividend by one<br>
	hundred. Secondary tip vibration excursion is the magnitude of a minor axis, or<br>
	other arbitrary axis, of the ellipse or ellipsoid created by a point on the distal most<br>
	end of ultrasonic blade 88 when the ultrasonic blade 88 is activated.<br><br>

	lumens. Additionally, the lumen or lumens may have cross-sectional shapes<br>
	selected from many manufacturable designs including, but not limited to, round,<br>

	lumen 9 is extended or retracted to a nodal (longitudinal, transverse, or torsional-<br>
	rnode or motion) position 7 or any other desirable position along a representative<br>
	blade 6. There are many variations in blade 6 shape and length such as a<br>
	spoon shape, a blade 6 with a dramatic curve, a blade 6 with a flat curve, etc.<br>
	These embodiments of ultrasonic surgical device 14 alter the location of the<br>
	nodal positions 7, at times creating several nodal locations 7 along the blade 6.<br>
	These particular examples are designed to ba excited at a frequency<br>

	(i.e. transverse motion) occurring in a wave pattern with associated non-<br>
	longitudinal nodes present at one or more location along the tissue effecting<br>
	portion. The lumen 9 is extendable/ retractable to allow the terminus of lumen 9<br>
	to be positioned at one of the transverse nodal positions 7. The lumen 9 is<br>
	retractable/extendable by several means, including manual extension, gear<br>
	extension, trigger extension and by other means of mechanical actuation that<br>
	may be located at the proximal end of surgical device 14, as is well known to<br>
	those skilled in !he design of medical instruments. The method of creating<br>
	suction/irrigation through lumen 9 may be done through a variety of means such<br>
	as by attaching lumen 9 to a stand alone suction/irrigation rnodule, tower<br>
	mounted suction 200 and/or irrigation 202 modules (Fig. 1), or an integrated<br>
	ultrasonic generator/suction/irrigation module in the operating room. It may also<br>
	be advantageous to integrate suction/irrigation controls (i.e. trumpet valves, etc.)<br>
	and a means far selecting either suction or irrigation within the device handle.<br>
