POLYBUTYLENE TEREPHTHALATE (PBT) RANDOM COPOLYMERS DERIVED<br>
FROM POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE (PET)<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefits of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/763083 filed January 27,2006, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/820469 filed July 26, 2006,which patent applications are fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of molding compositions.<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate (also referred to as "PET") is a polyester of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol can be obtained by the polycondensation of dimethyl terephthalate with ethylene glycol, and also terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol or ethylene oxide. PET exists both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline (opaque and white) thermoplastic material. Generally, it has useful chemical resistance to mineral oils, solvents and acids but not to bases. Semi-crystalline PET has good strength, ductility, stiffness and hardness. Amorphous PET has better ductility but less stiffness and hardness. PET is used to make bottles for soft drinks and other household and consumer products. Generally, PET has many uses and several large markets. For mis reason, the volume of PET manufactured is large and growing.<br>
Unfortunately, despite recycling efforts, billions of pounds of PET are still dumped into landfills annually all over the world. Other PET that is not reused is incinerated. The PET that is disposed into landfills creates significant waste. The incineration of PET wastes a significant resource that could be used more effectively.<br>
Thermoplastic molding compositions based on polybutylene terephthalate (also referred to as 'TBT"), polycarbonates, and impact modifiers are used in various applications. Although useful to many customers, conventional PBT-polycarbonate-impact modifier molding compositions generally cannot be made from recycle sources of PBT due to the lack of availability of large post-consumer or post-industrial PBT. PET, unlike PBT, is made in much larger quantities and is more easily recovered from consumer wastes. If PET (scrap) materials could be converted to PBT and converted into useful molding compositions, then there would exist a valuable way to meet the unmet need to effectively use underutilized scrap PET in PBT thermoplastic molding compositions. If PET (scrap) materials could be converted to PBT and converted into useful molding compositions, then there would be an effective use of post consumer or post-industrial streams. PBT made this way would conserve our non-renewable resources and reduce the formation of greenhouse gases, e.g., CO2.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611 teaches a process for converting waste polyethylene terephthalate to either poly(ethylene-co-butylene terephthalate) or poly butylene terephthalate (PBT) by reaction with 1,4-butanediol. In discussing the prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611 indicates that in most of the processes it cites, the undesirable byproduct diethylene glycol is formed, which contaminates the final product and has to be removed by purification before the recovered products can be reused again. A principal object of U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611 was to provide a process for converting polyethylene terephthalate waste directly to another high value polymer without breaking down the polyethylene terephthalate to its constituent monomers or oligomers. The patent discloses numerous examples in which a variety of polymers have a diol incorporated at various amounts. Example 11 shows a PBT polymer being formed with a complete replacement of ethylene glycol with 1,4-butanediol.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 teaches a process for making "PBT' from PET by reacting PET with 1,4-butanediol. A principal object of U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 was to produce PBT containing less than 1.0 wt. % units of ethylene glycol from PET scrap.<br>
Another principal objective of U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 was to develop a process that facilitates the reduction of THF generated in the process as much as possible to the extent that this PBT is economically competitive with PBT obtained from monomers. U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 emphasizes the production of PBT having ethylene glycol groups in an amount that is less than 1 wt. %. In the instances where compositions contain more than 1 wt. %, U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 presents these compositions in comparative examples. Such compositions are described as having "yellowish" and "slightly yellowish" colors, respectively.<br>
Japanese laid-open application 2005-89572 teaches a method for producing polybutylene terephthalate by transesterifying bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate with 1,4-butanediol in the presence of a transesterification reaction catalyst under the pressure of 1-54 kPa at a final temperature ranging from 200 - 230 °C and then subjecting he reaction product to polycondensation. In one embodiment, the bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate is obtained by depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate with excessive ethylene glycol, and purifying the depolymerized product. The patent teaches that transesterifying bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate with 1,4-butanediol under reduced pressure imparts favorable results,<br>
Unfortunately, such documents do not meet the long felt need of improved use of PET scrap that is ordinarily incinerated or buried in landfills. U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,611, for instance, does not teach effective processes that enable PET to be able to be broken down into its constituent monomers or oligomers-a feature that is sometimes required by commercial considerations. U.S. Pat. No. 5,451, 611 does not provide meaningful guidelines for making compositions functionally similar to PBT containing ethylene glycol in amounts other than trace amounts and which exhibit melting temperatures that are higher man those shown in its examples. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 does not provide meaningful details about how to make molding compositions containing polycarbonates, other materials such as flame retardants, epoxies, and PBT with a PET residue such as ethylene glycol in any amount, let alone an amount that is more than 1 wt.<br>
%. In fact, neither patent discusses if or how the materials they describe can be used in molding compositions containing polycarbonates, impact modifiers and other materials. Japanese laid-open application 2005-89572 is also silent about molding compositions containing polycarbonates, impact modifiers and PBT as well as methods for utilizing PET effectively to make such compositions. Known technology relating to utilizing PET as scrap materials for making PBT-like materials, in other words, does not provide meaningful solutions that solve the long felt need of new processes for better utilizing PET scrap that is ordinarily incinerated or buried in landfills. Known technology does not provide meaningful solutions that solve the long felt need of new thermoplastic compositions containing fillers and PBT derived from PET and a combination of physical properties that are highly useful and valued by customers.<br>
For the foregoing reasons, there is a need to develop new molding compositions containing fillers that utilize PBT derived from PET and that have useful performance properties.<br>
For the foregoing reasons, there is a need to develop new molding compositions that reduce the amount of CO2 emissions.<br>
For the foregoing reasons, there is a need to develop new processes for making molding compositions that utilize PBT derived from PET and that have useful performance properties.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the remarkable discovery that it is now possible to make molding compositions, which have useful physical properties, suitable in commercial applications, which contains a modified-PBT random copolymer derived from polyethylene terephthalate, e.g., used PET soft drink bottles. Unlike conventional molding compositions containing virgin PBT (PBT that is derived from monomers), the modified-PBT component used in the articles contains a polyethylene terephthalate<br>
residue, e.g., materials such as ethylene glycol and isophthalic acid groups (components that are not present in "virgin," monomer-based PBT). Advantageously, despite using a PBT that is structurally different from virgin PBT, our articles exhibit similar performance properties as articles made from molding compositions containing monomer-based PBT. The invention can provide a valuable way to meet the unmet need to effectively use underutilized scrap PET in PBT diermoplastic molding compositions. The invention can provide an effective use of post consumer or post-industrial streams. Further, the invention can conserve our non-renewable resources and reduce the formation of greenhouse gases, e.g., CO2. Surprisingly, molding compositions containing modified-Polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers derived from polyethylene terephthalate can exhibit improved flow properties, as compared to molding compositions containing PBT derived from monomers.<br>

The term "random copolymer," as used in this application refers to a copolymer that includes macromolecules in which the probability of finding a given monomelic unit at any given site in the chain is independent of the nature of the adjacent units.<br>
An embodiment of the invention relates to a composition comprising:<br>
(a) from 5 to 99 wt. % of a modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer that (1) is derived from polyethylene terephthalate component selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate<br>
copolymers and (2) at least one residue derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component, and<br>
(b) at least 1 wt. % of a filler component.<br>
The modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from polyethylene terephthalate (PET-derived modified PBT component) is (1) is derived from polyethylene terephthalate component selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate copolymers and (2) has at least one residue derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component. In one embodiment, the modified polybutylene terephthalate component can further be derived from a bioraass-derived 1,4-butanediol, e.g. com derived 1,4-butanediol or a 1,4-butane-diol derived from a cellulosic material.<br>
The residue derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component, which is present in the modified polybutylene terephthalate component can be selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol groups, diethylene glycol groups, isophthalic acid groups, antimony-containing compounds, germanium-containing compounds, titanium-containing compounds, cobalt-containing compounds, tin containing compounds, aluminµm, aluminum salts, 1,3-cyclohexanedimethanol isomers, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol isomers, the cis isomer of 1,3-cyclohexanedimethanol, the cis isomer of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, the 1,3-trans isomer of cyclohexanedimethanol, the 1,4-trans isomer of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, alkali salts, alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., calciµm, magnesiµm, sodium and potassium salts, phosphorous-containing compounds and anions, sulfur-containing compounds and anions, naphthalene dicarboxylic acids, 1,3-propanediol groups, and combinations thereof.<br>
Depending on factors such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate copolymers, the residue can include various combinations. In one embodiment, for instance, the residue includes mixtures of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol. In another embodiment, the residue includes mixtures of ethylene glycol and<br>
diethylene glycol and isophthalic acid. In another embodiment, the residue derived from polyethylene terephthalate further includes cis isomer of 1, 3-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1, 4-cyclohexanedimethanol, trans isomer of 1,-3 cyclohexanedimethanol, trans isomer of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the residue includes cis isomer of 1,3-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, trans isomer of 1,-3 cyclohexanedimethanol, trans isomer of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and combinations thereof. And in another embodiment, the residue can be a mixture of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, isophthalic acid groups, cis isomer of cyclohexanedimethanol, trans isomer of cyclohexanedimethanol, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the residue derived from polyethylene terephthalate includes mixtures of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and cobalt-containing compounds. Such cobalt-containing compound mixture can also contain isophthalic acid groups.<br>
The amount of the ethylene glycol groups, diethylene glycol groups, and the isophthalic groups in the polymeric backbone of the modified PBT component can vary. The PET-derived modified PBT component ordinarily contains isophthalic acid groups in an amount that is at least 0.1 mole% and can range from 0 or 0.1 to 10 mole % (0 or 0.07 to 7 wt. %). The PET-derived modified PBT component ordinarily contains ethylene glycol in an amount that is at least 0.1 mole% and can range from 0.1 to 10 mole % (0.02 to 2 wt. %). In one embodiment, the PET-derived modified PBT component has an ethylene glycol content that is more than 0.85 wt. %. The modified PBT component can also contain diethylene glycol in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10 mole % (0.04 to 4 wt. %). The amount of the butanediol groups is generally about 98 mole % and can vary from 95 to 99.8 mole % in some embodiments. The amount of the terephthalic acid groups is generally about 98 mole % and can vary from 90 to 99.9 mole % in some embodiments.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, all molar amounts of the isophthalic acid groups and or terephthalic acid groups are based on the total moles of diacids/diesters in the composition. Unless otherwise specified, all molar amounts of the butanediol, ethylene<br>
glycol, and diethylene glycol groups are based on the total moles of diol in the composition. The weight percent measurements stated above are based on the way terephthalic acid groups, isophthalic acid groups, ethylene glycol groups, and diethylene glycol groups have been defined herein.<br>
The total amount of materials of the polyethylene terephthalate component residue in the modified polybutylene random copolymer can vary. For instance, mixtures can be in an amount ranging from 1.8 to 2.5 wt. %, or from 0.5 to 2 wt. %, or from 1 to 4 wt. %. The ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and cyclohexanedimethanol groups can be individually or in combination present in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10 mole %, based on 100 mole % of glycol the molding composition. The isophthalic acid groups can be present in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10 mole %, based on 100 mole % of diacid/diester in the molding composition.<br>
It has been discovered that when it is desirable to make a polybutylene terephthalate copolymers having a melting temperature Tm that is at least 200 °C, the total amount of diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and isophthalic acid groups should be within a certain range. As such, in one embodiment, the total amount of the diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and isophthalic acid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate component is more than 0 and less than or equal to 23 equivalents, relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. In another suitable embodiment, the total amount of the isophthalic acid groups, ethylene glycol groups, and diethylene glycol groups ranges from 3 and less than or equal to 23 equivalents, relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. In another suitable embodiment, the total amount of the isophthalic acid groups, ethylene glycol groups, and diethylene glycol groups ranges from 3 and less than or equal to 10 equivalents, relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. In another suitable embodiment, the total amount of the<br>
isophthalic acid groups, ethylene glycol groups, and diethylene glycol groups ranges from 10 and less than or equal to 23 equivalents, relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. In one embodiment, diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol and/or isophthalic acid can be added during the process, thereby enabling the user with a system for making compositions having different properties.<br>
The total ethylene glycol groups, isophthalic acid groups, and diethylene glycol groups can vary, depending on the application and the user's needs. In one embodiment, the composition can have total monomer content selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, isophthalic acid groups, and diethylene glycol groups in an amount ranging from more than 0 and less than or equal to 17 equivalents relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. Advantageously, such compositions can maintain useful properties, such as heat deflection temperatures that are more than 180 °C.<br>
It has also been discovered that the total amount of inorganic residues derived from the polyethylene terephthalate can be present from more than 0 ppm and up to 1000 ppm. Examples of such inorganic residues can be selected from the group consisting of antimony-containing compounds, germanium-containing compounds, titanium-containing compounds, cobalt-containing compounds, tin containing compounds, aluminµm, aluminum salts, alkaline earth metal salts, alkali salts, including calciµm, magnesiµm, sodium and potassium salts, phosphorous-containing compounds and anions, sulfui-containing compounds and anions, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the amounts of inorganic residues can range from 250 to 1000 ppm. In another embodiment, the amounts of inorganic residues can range from 500 to 1000 ppm.<br>
The PET component from which the modified polybutylene terephthalate random<br>
copolymer is made can be in any form that can be used according to our invention. Generally, the PET component includes recycle (scrap) PET in flake, powder/chip, film, or pellet form. Before use, the PET is generally processed to remove impurities such as paper, adhesives, polyolefin, e.g., polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), nylon, polylactic acid and other contaminants. Also, the PET component can include PET that is not waste in flake, chip or pellet form. As such, PET that would ordinarily be deposited in landfills can now be used productively and effectively. In one embodiment, PET component can also include other polyesters. The PET component can also include polyester copolymers. Examples of such materials include polyalkylene terephthalates that can be selected from polyethylene terephthalate, polycyclohexane terephthalate, copolyesters of terephthalate esters with comonomers containing cyclohexyl dimethanol and ethylene glycol, copolyesters of terephthalate acid with comonomers containing cyclohexyl dimethanol and ethylene glycol, polybutylene terephthalate, poly-xylylene terephthalate, polydianol terephthalates, polybutylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate, polyester naphthalates, and combinations thereof.<br>
A modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer derived from the polyemylene terephthalate component can be derived from a polyethylene terephthalate component by any method that involves depolymerization of a polyethylene terephthalate component and polymerization of the depolymerized polyethylene terephthalate component with 1,4-butanediol into the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. For instance, the modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component can be made by a process that involves depolymerizing a polyethylene terephthalate component selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate copolymers with a 1,4-butanediol component at a temperature ranging from 180 °C to 230 °C, under agitation, at a pressure that is at least atmospheric pressure in the presence of a catalyst component, at an elevated temperature, under an inert atmosphere, to produce a molten mixture containing a component selected from the group consisting of oligomers containing ethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing ethylene isophthalate<br>
moieties, oligomers containing diethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing diethylene isophthalate moieties, oligomers containing butylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing butylene isophthalate moieties, covalently bonded oligomeric moieties containing at least two of the foregoing moieties, 1,4-butanediol, ethylene glycol, and combinations thereof; and agitating the molten mixture at subatmospheric pressure and increasing the temperature of the molten mixture to an elevated temperature under conditions sufficient to form a modified random polybutylene terephthalate copolymer containing at least one residue derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component.<br>
Polyester moieties and the 1,4-butanediol are combined in the liquid phase under agitation and the 1,4-butanediol can be continuously refluxed back into the reactor during step (a). The THF and water formed in the stage can be removed by distillation or partial condensation.<br>
The polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol component are generally combined under atmospheric pressure. In another embodiment of the invention, however, it is possible to use pressures that are higher than atmospheric pressures. For instance, in one embodiment, the pressure at which the polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol are subjected to is 2 atmospheres, or higher. For higher pressures, the reaction mixtures can be depolymerized at temperatures higher than 230 °C.<br>
The temperature at which the polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol component are combined and reacted is sufficient to promote depolymerization of the polyethylene terephthalate component into a mixture of oligomers containing ethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing ethylene isophthalate moieties, oligomers containing diethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing diethylene isophthalate moieties, oligomers containing butylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing butylene isophthalate moieties, covalently bonded oligomeric moieties containing at least two of the foregoing moieties,   1,4-butanediol,<br>
ethylene glycol, and combinations thereof. The temperature at which the polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol component are combined generally ranges from 180 °C to 230 °C. 1,4-butanediol is generally used in excess amount relative to the polyethylene terephthalate component. In one embodiment, 1,4-butanediol is used in a molar excess amount ranging from 2 to 20.<br>
During the initial stage of the process when the polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol are combined and react ("step (a)"), the polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol depolymerize into a molten mixture at a pressure that is at least atmospheric pressure suitable conditions. 1,4-butanediol, ethylene glycol, are generally recirculated, and tetrahydrofuran is distilled during "step(a)" of the process. The molten mixture contains oligomers containing ethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing ethylene isophthalate moieties, oligomers containing diethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing diethylene isophthalate moieties, oligomers containing butylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing butylene isophthalate moieties, covalently bonded oligomeric moieties containing at least two of the foregoing moieties, 1,4-butanediol, ethylene glycol, and combinations thereof.<br>
The duration of the step in which polyethylene terephthalate component reacts with 1,4-butanediol can vary, depending on factors, such as available equipment, production needs, desired final properties, and the like. In one embodiment, this step is carried out in at least 2 hours. In another embodiment, the step is carried out from 2 to 5 hours.<br>
The process further includes the step of subjecting the molten mixture to subatmospheric pressure and increasing the temperature of the molten mixture to a temperature ranging from 240 °C to 260 °C, and thereby forming the modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component.<br>
Excess butanediol, ethylene glycol, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) are preferably removed and step (b) is carried out under agitation. The molten mixture, when placed in subatmospheric pressure conditions at a suitable temperature for a sufficiently long time period, polymerizes into a modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component random copolymer.<br>
Generally, the molten mixture pressure is subjected to a. pressure ranging from subatmospheric to less than 1 Torr. In one embodiment, the pressure is reduced to a pressure ranging from 100 to 0.05 Torr in a continuous manner. In another embodiment, the pressure is reduced to a pressure ranging from 10 to 0.1 Torr in a continuous fashion.<br>
Advantageously, the molten mixture can be placed under subatmospheric conditions without isolation and dissolution of any material from the molten mixture. The avoidance of this step greatly enhances the utility of the process.<br>
During the step when the molten mixture is placed under subatmospheric conditions and the temperature is increased, excess butanediol, ethylene glycol and THF are removed from the reactor and oligomers are allowed to build in molecular weight. Agitation can be continuously provided to facilitate the removal of the low boiling components and allow the molecular weight buildup of the polymer. After sufficient molecular weight is obtained, the resulting molten PBT polymer is cast from the reactor through a diehead, cooled with water, stranded and chopped into pellets.<br>
The duration of the step (step (b) discussed above) in which the molten mixture polymerizes from polyethylene terephthalate and poly(butylene terephthlate) oligomers, 1,4, butanediol, and ethylene glycol can vary, depending on factors, such as equipment available, production needs, desired final properties, and the like. In one embodiment, this step is carried out in at least two hours. In another embodiment, the step is carried out from 2 to 5 hours.<br>
The temperature at which the molten mixture is placed under subatmospheric conditions   is   sufficiently  high   to   promote   polymerization  of  the   polyethylene<br>
terephthalate and poly(butylene terephthlate) oligomers, 1,4-butanediol, and ethylene glycol to the modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component. Generally, the temperature is at least 230 °C. In one embodiment, the temperature ranges from 250 °C to 275 °C.<br>
Both steps of the process can be carried out in the same reactor. In one embodiment, however, the process is carried out in two separate reactors, where step (a) is carried out in a first reactor and when the molten mixture has formed, the molten mixture is placed in a second reactor and step (b) is carried out. In another embodiment, the process can be carried out in more than two reactors. In another embodiment, the process can be carried out in a continuous series of reactors.<br>
The catalyst component that is used to facilitate the reaction of the process generally includes a catalyst that facilitates the reaction. The catalyst can be selected from antimony compounds, tin compounds, titanium compounds, combinations thereof as well as many other metal catalysts and combinations of metal catalysts that have been disclosed in the literature. The amount of the catalyst will vary on the specific need at hand. Suitable amounts of the catalyst range from 1 to 5000 ppm, or more.<br>
The catalyst component is generally added during the step when the polyethylene terephthalate component initially combines with the 1,4-butanediol. In another embodiment, however, the catalyst component may be added to the molten mixture that forms after the polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol component are combined.<br>
The process for making the modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component is preferably carried out under agitative conditions. The term "agitative conditions" or "agitation" refers to subjecting the polyethylene terephthalate component and the 1,4-butanediol or the molten mixture to conditions that involve physically mixing the polyethylene terephthalate component 1,4-butanediol or molten mixture under conditions that promote the depolymerization of the<br>
PET when the agitative conditions are applied to polyethylene terephthalate component 1,4-butanediol "step (a)", or the polymerization of the PBT from polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, 1,4-butanediol, and ethylene glycol "step (b)." The physical mixing can be accomplished by any suitable way. In one embodiment, a mixer containing rotating shaft and blades that are perpendicular to the shaft can be used.<br>
The process for making the modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component can include a step that reduces the amount of THF produced during the process by adding a basic compound containing an alkali metal to the reactor in step (a) and thereby reducing formation of THF.<br>
The basic compound contains an alkali metal and can be selected from one or more of the following compounds sodium alkoxides, sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonates, potassium alkoxides, potassium hydroxide, potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, lithium alkoxides, lithium hydroxide, lithium acetate, lithium carbonate, lithium bicarbonate, calcium alkoxides, calcium hydroxide, calcium acetate, calcium carbonate, calcium bicarbonates, magnesium alkoxides, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium acetate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium bicarbonates, aluminium alkoxides, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium acetate, aluminium carbonate, aluminium bicarbonates, and combinations thereof.<br>
The amount of the basic compound added to a mixture is generally at least 0.1 ppm. In one embodiment, the amount of the basic compound is from 0.1 to 50 ppm. In another embodiment, the amount of the basic compound ranges from 1 to 10 ppm.<br>
The addition of the basic compound containing an alkali metal can reduce the amount of total THF production, as compared to when the process is carried out without the basic compound. In one embodiment, the total THF produced during the process is reduced by at least 10 %, as compared to a process that does not use the basic compound. In another embodiment, the total THF produced during the process is reduced ranges from at least 10 % to 50 %, or more.<br>
In another embodiment, a difunctional epoxy compound can be added to reduce the formation of THF. The epoxy compounds may be selected from the group of difunctional epoxies. Examples of suitable difunctional epoxy compounds include and are not limited to difunctional epoxy compounds include, but are not limited to, 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexyl carboxylate, bis(3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl) adipate, vinylcyclohexene di-epoxide, bisphenol diglycidyl ethers such as bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether, tetrabromobisphenol-A diglycidyl ether, glycidol, diglycidyl adducts of amines and amides, diglycidyl adducts of carboxylic acids such as the diglycidyl ester of phthalic acid the diglycidyl ester of hexahydrophthalic acid, and bis(3,4-epoxy-6-methylcyclohexylmethyl) adipate, butadiene diepoxide, vinylcyclohexene diepoxide, dicyclopentadiene diepoxide, and the like. Especially preferred is 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-3,4 epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate. The amount of the epoxy that may be added to the mixture is generally at least 0.05 wt. %. In one embodiment, the amount of the epoxy compound is from 0.1 to 1 wt. %. In another embodiment, the amount of the epoxy compound was 0.2 to 0.5 wt. %. In one embodiment, the invention provides an additional embodiment in which THF production is reduced by a process that involves the steps of:<br>
(a) reacting (i) a polyethylene terephthalate component selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate copolymers with a diol component selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and combinations thereof, in a reactor at a pressure that is at least atmospheric pressure in the presence of a catalyst component at a temperature ranging from 190 °C to 250 °C, under an inert atmosphere, under conditions sufficient to depolymerize the polyethylene terephthalate component into a first molten mixture containing components selected from the group consisting of oligomers containing ethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing ethylene isophthalate moieties, oligomers containing diethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing diethylene isophthalate moieties, oligomers containing trimethylene terephthalate moieties, oligomers containing trimethylene isophthalate moieties, covalently bonded oligomeric moieties containing at<br>

(c)	increasing the temperature of the second molten mixture under subatmospheric conditions and agitation to a temperature from 240 °C to 260 °C, thereby forming a modified random polybutylene terephthalate copolymer containing at least one residue derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component.<br>
This three step embodiment provides an additional advantageous way for producing modified Polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers from PET. The diol component used in step (a) f of the three step embodiment can be selected from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and combinations thereof. The diol component can be present in step (a) at a molar amount that is at least half the amount of ethylene glycol moieties present in the polyethylene terephthalate component. The depolymerization of the polyethylene terephthalate component can be carried out for various times. In one embodiment, the depolymerization is carried out for at least 25 minutes.<br>
The 1,4-butanediol used during step (b) of the three step embodiment can be added at a molar amount that is in excess relative to the molar amount of butanediol moieties incorporated into the modified polybutylene terephmalate random copolymer component obtained in step (c).<br>
During the process the compounds used in the process can be reused and/or collected. In one embodiment, the diol component selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and combinations thereof and (2) 1,4-butanediol are removed and collected in a vessel in step (b). In another embodiment, in step (b), 1,4-butanediol is refluxed back into the reactor and a component seliected from the group of excess butanediol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, and combinations thereof is removed. Step (b) is practiced for a sufficient period of time to reduce at least 65 % of ethylene glycol from the second molten mixture. The duration of step (b) can also vary. In one embodiment, step (b) lasts at least 45 minutes. The pressure at which step (b) is carried out can vary. In one embodiment, step (b) is carried out in atmospheric conditions. In another embodiment, step (b) is carried out in subatmospheric conditions. Different combinations are possible. In one embodiment, step (b) is carried out with excess 1, 4-butanediol and at a pressure ranging from 300 to 1500 mbar absolute. In another embodiment, 1,4-butanediol is used in a molar excess amount ranging from 1.1 to 5.<br>
Step(c) of the three step embodiment can also be carried out with modifications, depending on the application. In one embodiment, for instance, a component selected from the group of excess butanediol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, and combinations thereof is removed during step (c). The pressure at which step (c) is carried out can also vary. In one embodiment, step (c) is carried out at a pressure that is less than 10 mbar. The three step process can be carried out in the same reactor. Alternatively, the three step process can be carried out in at least two reactors.<br>
In another embodiment, the three step process can include the step of adding a basic compound during step (a), step (b), step (c), and combinations thereof, and thereby further reduce THF production. The basic compound, as in the two step embodiment, can contain those compounds mentioned above. Alternatively, difunctional epoxy compounds can be added during step (b) in the amounts indicated above.<br>
Advantageously the three step process can reduce tetrahydrofuran by an amount that is at least 30 % as compared to the amount of tetrahydrofuran produced by a process that depolymerizes polyethylene terephthalate component with 1,4-butanediol instead of the diol component selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and combinations thereof.<br>
The process for making the modified polybutylene terephthalate component derived from the polyethylene terephthalate component may contain an additional step in which the PBT formed from the molten mixture is subjected to solid-state polymerization. Solid-state polymerization generally involves subjecting the PBT formed from the molten mixture to an inert atmosphere or subatmospheric pressure and heating to a temperature for a sufficient period of time to build the molecular weight of the PBT. Generally, the temperature to which the PBT is heated is below the melting point of the PBT, e.g., from 5 °C to 60 °C below the melting point of the PBT. In one embodiment, such a temperature may range from 150 °C to 210 °C. Suitable periods of time during which the solid-state polymerization occurs may range from 2 to 20 hours, depending on the conditions and equipment. The solid-state polymerization is generally carried out under tumultuous conditions sufficient to promote further polymerization of the PBT to a suitable molecular weight. Such tumultuous conditions may be created by subjecting the PBT to tumbling, the pumping of inert gas into the system to promote fluidization of polymer particle, e.g., pellets, chips, flakes, powder, and the like. The solid-state polymerization can be carried out at atmospheric pressure and/or under reduced pressure, e.g. from 1 atmosphere to 1 mbar<br>
Our invention includes an embodiment in which the 1,4-butanediol can be derived from biomass. The term "biomass" means living or dead biological matter that can be directly or subsequently converted to useful chemical substances that are ordinarily derived from non-renewable hydrocarbon sources. Biomass can include cellulosic materials, grains, starches derived from grains, fatty acids, plant based oils, as well as derivatives from these biomass examples. Examples of useful chemical substances include and are not limited to diols; diacids; monomers used to make diols or acids, e.g., succinic acid; monomers used to make polymers; and the like. Biomass based butanediol can be obtained from several sources. For instance, the following process can be used to obtain biomass-based 1,4-butanediol. Agriculture based biomass, such as com, can be converted into succinic acid by a fermentation process that also consumes carbon dioxide. Such succinic acid is commercially available from several sources such as from Diversified Natural Products Inc. under the trade name " BioAmber™ ". This succinic acid can be easily converted into 1,4-butanediol by processes described in several published documents such as in US Pat. No. 4,096,156, incorporated herein in its entirety. Biomass derived-1,4-butanediol can also be converted to tetrahydrofuran, and further converted to polytetrahydrofuran, also known as polybutylene oxide glycol. Another process that describes converting succinic acid into 1,4-butanediol is described in Life Cycles Engineering Guidelines, by Smith et al, as described in EPA publication EPAA500/R-1/101 (2001).<br>
The amount of the PET-derived modified PBT component in a molding composition varies with the specific application. Generally, the amount of the PET-derived modified PBT component in a molding composition of the invention ranges from to 5 to 90 wt. %. In another embodiment, the amount of the PET-derived modified PBT component in a composition ranges from 5 to 99 wt.%. In another embodiment, the amount of the PET-derived modified PBT component is present ranges from 10 to 50 wt.<br>
The filler component of the molding compositions generally includes inorganic fillers to the thermoplastic resin provide higher tensile modulus, density and low coefficient of thermal expansion without deleteriously affecting the other favorable properties. Examples of suitable inorganic fillers include: alumina, amorphous silica, anhydrous alumino silicates, mica, wollastonite, barium sulfate, zinc sulfide, clays, talc, metal oxides such as titanium dioxide. Low levels (0.1-10.0 wt. %) of very small particle size (largest particles less than 10 microns in diameter) are useful in one embodiment. In one embodiment, the filler are present in an amount that is at least 1 wt. %, and the fillers are selected from the group consisting of glass fillers, ceramic fillers, carbon fillers, nano-fillers, nano-tubes, nano-composites, and combinations thereof.<br>
A particularly suitable embodiment of fillers includes reinforcing fibers such as glass, ceramic and carbon and are generally well known in the art, as are their methods of manufacture. In one embodiment, glass is particularly suitable, especially glass that is relatively soda free. Fibrous glass filaments comprised of lime-alumino-borosilicate glass, which is also known as "E" glass are often especially suitable. Glass fiber is added to the composition to increase the flexural modulus and strength. The glass filaments can be made by standard processes, e.g., by steam or air blowing, flame blowing and mechanical pulling. The preferred filaments for plastic reinforcement are made by mechanical pulling. For achieving optimal mechanical properties; fiber diameter between 6-20 microns are required with a diameter of from 10-15 microns being preferred. In preparing the molding compositions it is convenient to use the fiber in the form of chopped strands of from about 1/8" (3 mm) to about 1/2" (13 mm) long although roving may also be used. In articles molded from the compositions, the fiber length is typically shorter presumably due to fiber fragmentation during compounding of the composition. The length of such short glass fibers present in final molded compositions is less than about 4 mm. The fibers may be treated with a variety of coupling agents to improve adhesion to the resin matrix. Preferred coupling agents include; amino, epoxy, amide or mercapto functionalized silanes. Organo metallic coupling agents, for example, titanium or zirconium based organo metallic compounds, may also be used.<br>
Other preferred sizing-coated glass fibers are commercilly available from Owens Coming Fiberglass as, for example, OCF K filament glass fiber 183F.<br>
In another embodiment, long glass fibers can be used, wherein a continuous glass fiber bundle containing glass fiber monofilaments having a diameter in the range, 10-24 µm, preferably 13-18 µm is impregnated with a melted thermoplastic preferably a polyester. After cooling, the impregnated bundle is cut into pellets having a length of &gt;5 mm, preferably, above &gt;9mm. For impregnation, a high flow polyester of the present invention can be used in order to improve the wetting rate of the filaments to make long glass fiber pellets. These pellets can be incorporated into the polyester compositions of the invention, to get long fiber glass reinforced polyester compositions. The length of long glass fiber present in molded composition prepared by this method is typically greater than mat prepared by incorporation of short fibers and the predominant portion of the long glass fibers present have a length &gt;4 mm in the molded part. Such long fiber glass reinforced compositions can be used for different molding techniques such as injection molding, compression molding, thermoforming and the like. As in the case of short fibers, the long fibers may also be treated with a variety of coupling agents to improve adhesion to resin. For those skilled in the art, a continuous process such as pultrusion technique for direct incorporation of long glass fibers in high flow polyester compositions will also be possible.<br>
Additionally PET-derived PBT can be incorporated into chopped strands of glass as a powder in a papermaking process. PET-derived PBT can be incorporated into continuous glass tapes through a pultrusion or a powder incorporation method or through a rod or shape pultrusion process.<br>
Other fillers and reinforcing agents may be used alone or in combination with reinforcing fibers. These include but are not limited to: carbon fibrils, mica, talc, barytes, calcium carbonate, wollastonite, milled glass, flaked glass, ground quartz, silica, zeolites, and solid or hollow glass beads or spheres, polyester fibers or aramid fibers.<br>
The glass fibers may be blended first with the PET-derived PBT component and then fed to an extruder and the extrudate cut into pellets, or, in a preferred embodiment, they may be separately fed to the feed hopper of an extruder. In a highly suitable embodiment, the glass fibers may be fed downstream in the extruder to minimize attrition of the glass. Generally, for preparing pellets of the composition set forth herein, the extruder is maintained at a temperature of approximately 480 °F to 550 °F (249 to 287 °C). The pellets so prepared when cutting the extrudate may be one-fourth inch long or less. As stated previously, such pellets contain finely divided uniformly dispersed glass fibers in the composition. The dispersed glass fibers are reduced in length as a result of the shearing action on the chopped glass strands in the extruder barrel.<br>
In one embodiment, the filler component includes nanofillers. Suitable nanofillers can include silicates, generally clays, in particular phyllosilicates such as montmorillonite, nontronite, beidelite, volkonskoite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, magadiite, medmontite, fluorohectorite, vermiculite, kaolinite. Clays, in particular phyllosilicates, which have a lamellar structure, contain for example alkali cations such as K+ or Na+ or alkaline-earth cations or even organic cations such as alkylamrnoniutn or alkylsulphonium ions, obtained by ion exchange reactions, between their lamellae. Other nanoparticle includes, nano particles of metal oxides such as titanium oxides, silicon oxides, and the like.<br>
The fillers can include organic fibers. Organic fibers include and are not limited to syndietic polymer fibers such as polyamides,e.g., Kevlar™ fibers, or natural fibers. Examples of suitable fibers include coconut fibers, jute fibers, flax fibers, and naturally occuring cellulosic fibers. These fibers can be used individually or in combination with other fibers or other filler described herein. Since natural fibers are derived from biomass, such as plant sources, such a feature is attractive to some customers who are increasingly interested in using such materials. Also, the use of organic or natural fibers generally result in parts having a relative low densities and relatively lower weights.<br>
The amount of the filler component in a composition used to make an article is generally at least 1 wt. %. In one embodiment, the amount of the filler component ranges from 5 wt. % to 70 wt. %. In another embodiment, the amount of the filler component ranges from 30 to 50 wt. %.<br>
The amounts of fillers can depend on the types of fillers and the applications.<br>
When organic fibers are used as fillers, the amount of organic fibers can range from 1 to 50 wt. %. In one embodiment, for instance, the fillers are present in an amount that is at least 1 wt. %, where fillers are selected from the group of glass fillers, ceramic fillers, carbon fillers, metal fillers, mineral fillers, nano-fillers, nano-tubes, talc, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the fillers are nanotubes and the nanotubes are present in an amount that is more than 0 and less than 1 wt. %. In another embodiment, the fillers are nanotubes and the nanotubes are present in an amount from 0.0001 to less man 1 wt. %. In one embodiment, the amount of the filler component ranges from 5 wt. % to 70 wt. %. In another embodiment, the amount of the filler component ranges from 30 to 50 wt. %. In another embodiment,the composition contain an inorganic filler in sufficient amounts to increase the heat deflection temperature of the composition, as compared to the composition without me inorganic filler. An artisan, however, will appreciate the amounts for specific materials can vary, depending on the embodiments. Low levels, e.g., from 0.1 to 10.0 wt. % of fillers having a very small particle size (where largest particles are less than 10 microns in diameter) are useful in one embodiment.<br>
In one embodiment, a composition contains a flame retarding component. The flame-retarding component can be added the composition to suppress, reduce, delay or modify the propagation of a flame through a composition or an article based on the composition.

This class of polyester includes the poly(alkylene terephthalates).<br>
In addition to the ester units, the polyester-polycarbonates comprise carbonate units as described hereinabove. Carbonate units of formula (1) may also be derived from aromatic dihydroxy compounds of formula (7), wherein specific carbonate units are resorcinol carbonate units.<br>
Specifically, the polyester unit of a polyester-polycarbonate can be derived from the reaction of a combination of isophthalic and terephthalic diacids (or derivatives thereof) with resorcinol, bisphenol A, or a combination comprising one or more of these, wherein the molar ratio of isophthalate units to terephthalate units is 91:9 to 2:98, specifically 85:15 to 3:97, more specifically 80:20 to 5:95, and still more specifically 70:30 to 10:90. The polycarbonate units can be derived from resorcinol and/or bisphenol A, in a molar ratio of resorcinol carbonate units to bisphenol A carbonate units of 0:100 to 99:1, and the molar ratio of the mixed isophthalate-terephthalate polyester units to the polycarbonate units in the polyester-polycarbonate can be 1:99 to 99:1, specifically 5:95<br>
to 90:10, more specifically 10:90 to 80:20. Where a blend of polyester-polycarbonate with polycarbonate is used, the weight ratio of polycarbonate to polyester-polycarbonate in the biend can be, respectively, 1:99 to 99:1, specifically 10:90 to 90:10.<br>
The polyester-polycarbonates may have a weight-averaged molecular weight (Mw) of 1,500 to 100,000, specifically 1,700 to 50,000, and more specifically 2,000 to 40,000. Molecular weight determinations are performed using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using a crosslinked styrene-divinylbenzene column and calibrated to polycarbonate references. Samples are prepared at a concentration of about 1 mg/ml, and are eluted at a flow rate of about 1.0 ml/min.<br>
Suitable polycarbonates can be manufactured by processes such as interfacial polymerization and melt polymerization. Although the reaction conditions for interfacial polymerization may vary, an exemplary process generally involves dissolving or dispersing a dihydric phenol reactant in aqueous caustic soda or potash, adding the resulting mixture to a suitable water-immiscible solvent mediµm, and contacting the reactants with a carbonate precursor in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as triethylamine or a phase transfer catalyst, under controlled pH conditions, e.g., 8 to 10. The most commonly used water immiscible solvents include methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, toluene, and the like. Suitable carbonate precursors include, for example, a carbonyl halide such as carbonyl bromide or carbonyl chloride, or a haloformate such as a bishaloformates of a dihydric phenol (e.g„ the bischloroformates of bisphenol A, hydroquinone, or the like) or a glycol (e.g., the bishaloformate of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, or the like). Combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing types of carbonate precursors may also be used. A chain stopper (also referred to as a capping agent) may be included during polymerization. The chain-stopper limits molecular weight growth rate, and so controls molecular weight in the polycarbonate. A chain-stopper may be at least one of mono-phenolic compounds, mono-carboxylic acid chlorides, and/or mono-chloroformates.<br>
For example, mono-phenolic compounds suitable as chain stoppers include monocyclic phenols, such as phenol, C1-C22 alkyl-substituted phenols, p-cumyl-phenol, p-tertiary-butyl phenol, hydroxy diphenyl; monoethers of diphenols, such as p-methoxyphenol. Alkyl-substituted phenols include those with branched chain alkyl substituents having 8 to 9 carbon atoms. A mono-phenolic UV absorber may be used as capping agent. Such compounds include 4-substituted-2-hydroxybenzophenones and their derivatives, aryl salicylates, monoesters of diphenols such as resorcinol monobenzoate, 2-(2-hydroxyaryl)-benzotriazoles and their derivatives, 2-(2-hydroxyaryl)-l,3,5-triazines and their derivatives, and the like. Specifically, mono-phenolic chain-stoppers include phenol, p-cumylphenol, and/or resorcinol monobenzoate.<br>
Mono-carboxylic acid chlorides may also be suitable as chain stoppers. These include monocyclic, mono-carboxylic acid chlorides such as benzoyl chloride, C1-C22 alkyl-substituted benzoyl chloride, toluoyl chloride, halogen-substituted benzoyl chloride, bromobenzoyl chloride, cinnamoyl chloride, 4-nadimidobenzoyl chloride, and mixtures thereof; polycyclic, mono-carboxylic acid chlorides such as trimellitic anhydride chloride, and naphthoyl chloride; and mixtures of monocyclic and polycyclic mono-carboxylic acid chlorides. Chlorides of aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with up to 22 carbon atoms are suitable. Functionalized chlorides of aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, such as acryloyl chloride and methacryoyl chloride, are also suitable. Also suitable are mono-chloroformates including monocyclic, mono-chloroforraates, such as phenyl chloroformate, alkyl-substituted phenyl chloroformate, p-cumyl phenyl chloroformate, toluene chloroformate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The polyester-polycarbonates may be prepared by interfacial polymerization. Rather than utilizing the dicarboxylic acid per se, it is possible, and sometimes even preferred, to employ the reactive derivatives of the acid, such as the corresponding acid halides, in particular the acid dichlorides and the acid dibromides. Thus, for example instead of using isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, or mixtures thereof, it is possible to employ isophthaloyl dichloride, terephthaloyl dichloride, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Among the phase transfer catalysts that may be used are catalysts of the formula<br>
(R3)4Q+X, wherein each R3 is the same or different, and is a C1-IO alkyl group; Q is a<br>
nitrogen or phosphorus atom; and X is a halogen atom or a C1-8 alkoxy group or C6-18<br>
aryloxy group. Suitable phase transfer catalysts include, for example, [CH3(CH2)3]4NX,<br>
[CH3(CH2)3]4PX,	[CH3(CH2)5]4NX,	[CH3(CH2)6]4NX,	[CH3(CH2)4)4NX,<br>
CH3[CH3(CH2)3]3NX, and CH3[CH3(CH2)2]3NX, wherein X is Cl', Br, a C1-8 alkoxy group or a C6-10 aryloxy group. An effective amount of a phase transfer catalyst may be 0.1 to 10 wt% based on the weight of bisphenol in the phosgenation mixture. In another embodiment an effective amount of phase transfer catalyst may be 0.5 to 2 wt% based on the weight of bisphenol in the phosgenation mixture.<br>
Alternatively, melt processes may be used to make the polycarbonates. Generally, in the melt polymerization process, polycarbonates may be prepared by co-reacting, in a molten state, the dihydroxy reactant(s) and a diaryl carbonate ester, such as diphenyl carbonate, in the presence of a transesterification catalyst in a Banbury® mixer, twin screw extruder, or the like to form a uniform dispersion. Volatile monohydric phenol is removed from the molten reactants by distillation and the polymer is isolated as a molten residue.<br>
In addition to the polycarbonates, polyester-polycarbonates, and combinations of these as described above, it is also possible to use combinations of the polycarbonates and polyester-polycarbonates with other thermoplastic polymers, for example combinations of polycarbonates and/or polycarbonate copolymers with polyesters.<br>
The polycarbonate may also comprise a polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer, also referred to as a polysiloxane-polycarbonate. The polysiloxane (also referred to herein as "polydiorganosiloxane") blocks of the copolymer comprise repeating siloxane units (also referred to herein as "diorganosiloxane units") of formula (8):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein each occurrence of R is same or different, and is a C1-13 monovalent organic radical. For example, R may independently be a C1-C13 alkyl group, C1-C13 alkoxy group, C2-C13 alkenyl group, C2-C13 alkenyloxy group, C3-C6 cycloalkyl group, C3-C6 cycloalkoxy group, C6-C14 aryl group, C6-C10 aryloxy group, C7-C13 arylalkyl group, C7-C13 arylalkoxy group, C7-C13 alkylaryl group, or C7-C13 alkylaryloxy group. The foregoing groups may be fully or partially halogenated with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or a combination thereof. Combinations of the foregoing R groups may be used in the same copolymer.<br>
The value of D in formula (8) may vary widely depending on the type and relative amount of each component in the thermoplastic composition, the desired properties of the composition, and like considerations. Generally, D may have an average value of 2 to 1,000, specifically 2 to 500, and more specifically 5 to 100.

In another embodiment, the composition further comprises an organic additive in sufficient amounts to increase the heat deflection temperature of the composition, as compared to the composition without the organic additive.<br>
The invention provides previously unavailable advantages. For instance, the invention provides molding compositions that function comparably with those based on PBT, despite using a structurally different material containing isophthalic groups and ethylene glycol groups. Since the molding compositions do not require the conventionally prepared PBT, the invention increases demand for the use of PET and thereby reduces the need to dispose PET scrap in landfills or by incineration.<br>
Further, the process for making the PET-derived random, modified PBT copolymers used in our compositions can advantageously substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions and solid waste. Since the PET-derived polyester random modified PBT copolymers made by the inventive process are made from scrap PET and not<br>
monomers, me process significantly reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emissions and solid waste. Carbon waste reduction (or crude oil savings) occurs because the carbon that constitutes the dimethyl terephthalate or terephthalic acid ordinarily used to make polyesters is not used, rather a PET component, e.g., polyester scrap, is replaced. The process to make DMT or TPA from crude oil is highly energy intensive and as a result, substantial emissions of C02 to the atmosphere occur from burning of non-renewable energy sources. By not using DMT or TPA to make the PET derived PBT, carbon dioxide emissions savings are obtained. In one embodiment, the process for making PET-derived modified PBT can eliminate at least 1 kg of CO2 emissions for every kilogram of PET-derived modified PBT made with the process, as compared to a process that makes virgin PBT homopolymers from monomers. In another embodiment, the process for making PET-derived modified PBT can eliminate from 1 kg to 1.5 kg, or more CO2 emissions for every kilogram of PET-derived modified PBT made with the inventive process, as compared to a process that makes virgin PBT homopolymers from monomers. Additionally, there are energy savings/reduced carbon dioxide emissions when the ethylene glycol byproduct is recovered and is used instead of ordinary ethylene glycol in manufacturing.<br>
Additionally, when the source of BDO is from biomass derived, feedstocks such as succinic acid, me carbon dioxide savings are further increased for two reasons. Bio derived succinic acid is made form sugars or other bio derived hydrocarbons that are the derived from atmospheric carbon versus fossil fuel carbon sources, thus reducing the environmental impact of the polymer derived from BDO based on succinic acid from biomass sources. Furthermore, the fermentation to yield succinic acid requires carbon dioxide as an input thus leading to further carbon dioxide reductions.<br>
Advantageously, a molding composition containing the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers can have a reduced CO2 emissions index. The reduced CO2 emissions index, as defined in mis application, is the amount of CO2, expressed in kg, that is saved when one (1) kg of a composition containing the modified polybutylene<br>
terephthalate random copolymers is made, as compared to the amount of CO2, expressed in kg, that is created when the composition is made with polybutylene terephthalate that is derived from monomers. Generally, our compositions generally have a reduced C02 emissions index that is more than approximately 0.06 kg, and can range from 0.06 kg to<br>
2.25.<br>
The basis for this feature is discussed below. The difference between the amount of CO2 that is created during ordinary processes for making virgin, monomer-derived polybutylene terephthalate homopolymers  and the process for making 1 kg of the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers can range from 1.3 kg to 2.5 kg, or more suitably from 1.7 kg to 2.2 kg. It should be noted that this difference is based on calculations for the entire process that starts from crude oil to the monomers to the PBT versus scrap PET to oligomers to the modified PBT. In other words, the process for making 1 kg of the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymers creates 1.3 to 2.5 kilograms less CO2 as compared to the process for making 1kg of virgin PBT from crude oil. To determine the ranges of the reduced CO2 emissions index for our compositions (which have the modified PBT random copolymers present in an amount ranging from 5 to 90 wt. %), the CO2 reduction index can be calculated by multiplying the lower amount of the polybutylene butylene terephthalate present in the composition, in percentage terms, with 1.3 (0.05 x1.3= 0.065) and the higher amount of the polytbutylene terephthalate times 2.5. (0.90x 2.5= 2.25).<br>
These results can be derived and verified by using material and energy balance calculations (calculations that are well know in the chemical engineering art) and comparing the amount of energy used to make modified PBT rEindom copolymers from PET and the amount of energy used to make PBT from terephthalic acid.<br>
The invention is further described in the following illustrative examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
EXAMPLES MATERIALS The following Table A describes the materials used in the Examples<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer was derived from polyethylene terephthalate as follows. Clear PET bottle scrap was obtained from a commercial source. In the scrap cleaning process, the PET scrap was cleaned manually involving first a hot water wash followed by manual sorting to separate colored bottles and PVC bottles, crushing, hydrofloatation to separate PP, labels, caps etc., alkali wash to remove glue, and finally a demineralized water wash to remove alkali followed by drying. The resulting PET flakes were used as the main raw material in the depolymerization step. The post consumer recycle PET flakes had an iv specification of 0.68 to 0.78 dl/g and a melting point specification of 245 to 255 °C. The PVC content was less than 10 ppm by specification. The butanediol was obtained from BASF and had a purity specification of &gt;99.5 wt. %. The ethylene glycol was obtained from Merck and had a purity specification of&gt;99.5 wt. %. The TPT catalyst used was the commercial Tyzor grade available from Dupont.<br>
Depolymerization (Glycolysis) with ethylene glycol - preparation of first mixture. Depolymerization of PET flakes was carried out at a mole ratio of PET ('mer' repeat unit) to EG in the ratio ranging from 1: 0.8 to 1:2.0 to make the depolymerization product. The reaction was conducted in the presence of catalyst (titaniµm, antimony or tin compounds (ranging from 50 tol25 ppm)) or without any added catalyst. The process was carried out under a pressure in the range 1.0 bar -6 bar and at a temperature of 200 ° C to 260 °C). The total time of depolymerization was from 20 to 120 min and preferably from 30 to 100 min. This was further followed by filtration of the mass to remove black specs and other insoluble impurities. The resulting mass was called the first mixture. The depolymerization reaction conditions employed was as presented in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Transesterification - Preparation of second mixture (at atmospheric pressure)<br>
Transesterification was done by reacting the first mixture with BDO with or without cocatalyst. The cocatalyst can be sodium methoxide of (10-14 ppm) or other alkali metal salts. The BDO was taken in excess over the stoichiometric requirement and the mole ratio of excess to stoichiometric requirement was in the range from 2.0 to 4.0. The reaction was conducted in the presence of additional amount of catalyst (50-120 ppm of Ti, Sn or Sb catalysts or combinations thereof) at temperature ranging from 200 to 245 °C and more preferably from 210 to 235 °C at atmospheric pressure for 10-40 min and more preferably 15-30 min. During this period, the vapors were passed through a distillation column wherein the EG and THF were removed after separation from BDO which was refluxed back into the reactor. This resulted in the reaction mass called second mixture. The second mixture was not characterized and the reaction was continued as given below to form the third mixture.<br>
Preparation of third mixture (at pressures in the range from 95 kPa to 50 kPa)<br>
The second mixture was subjected to a pressure initially in the range of 95 to 80 kPa for a period of 10-40 min and more preferably 15-30 min. During this period, the temperature was controlled between 190 and 235 °C and more preferably between 190 and 220 °C and the vapors were subjected to distillation and much of the BDO of condensed vapors was refluxed back accompanied by the removal of EG, THF and minor amounts of BDO. At this stage, 80 % of total EG present both as free and as bound was removed by distillation<br>
during transesterification. Subsequently, the pressure was reduced gradually to a range of 75 to 50 kPa and the temperature was maintained between 190 and 235 °C and more preferably between 190 and 220 °C. The total time for transesterification was maintained between 30 to 150 min and preferably between 90 to 120 min. EG, THF and minor amount of BDO were removed by distillation and as before, much of the BDO was continuously refluxed back into the reactor. This resulted in the formation of a third mixture. The reaction conditions employed and the amounts of various ingredients collected in the distillate at the end of transesterification were as sihown in Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Recycling the BDO enabled a favorable BDO to EG ratio in the transesterification reactor and also improved productivity by lowering the transesterification time. EG was reused in the depolymerization step and BDO was reused in the transesterification step. The THF and water mixture were sent to storage vessels.<br>
Polycondensation using the third mixture was carried out at a temperature ranging from 230 to 265 °C and preferably from 245 to 255 °C. The pressure was gradually reduced to a level of 0.01 kPa to 1 kPa to enable molecular weight build-up. The reaction was conducted within a time span of 45 to 120 min and preferably 45 to 75 min. During polycondensation, excess BDO and residual EG were removed, along with THF and Water. The vapor byproducts were subjected to distillation to separate EG, BDO, THF and water mixture. The final polymer product (PBT) had a I.V. ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 dl/gm and EG content less than 0.5 wt. % each based on final polymer. Typically, the IPA content was less man 2 % in the polymer. The melting point of the final polymer was in the range from 215 to 222 °C. The experimental conditions used for polycondensation and the composition of the distillates were as shown in Table 3.<br>

The results produced a modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer containing residues from the polyethylene terephthalate. The modified polybutylene terephthalate was subjected to solid state polymerization.<br>

RESULTS/DISCUSSION<br>
Table 6 shows the physical properties obtained for Examples 2-5. <br>

Surprisingly, it is seen from Table 6 that both the glass filled molding compositions show an enhancement in the flow when the virgin PBT is substituted by the modified PBT. The increase in flow as measured by the MVR of the system lies between 15 and 38 % for the examples shown in Table 6. Example 2 is more energy efficient than Example 3. A savings of 14.7 MJ/kg is derived in making molding composition 2 versus 3. Similarly, example 4 is also more energy efficient compared to example 5. Example 5 requires an excess of 21.6 MJ/kg energy to produce versus Example 4.<br>

It is interesting to note that even with a mineral filler such as talc, the enhancement in flow of a molding composition containing modified PBT remains. In the case of the talc filled molding composition shown above, an increase of 47 % in the melt volume rate (MVR) was observed. Such an increase in the MVR can improve the flow and can reduce the cycle times and injection pressures for making articles.<br>

The data shown in the Table 12 was also plotted graphically (Figure 1) to understand the behavior of the molding compositions over different PBT ratios.<br>
Fig. 1 shows capillary Viscosity at 1520/s versus Ratio of Low iv PBT to (Low iv PBT + High iv PBT) in the Molding Composition. Interestingly, the data from Fig. 1 shows that over the entire range of PBT ratios in the molding composition, the modified PBT composition consistently displays a viscosity that is lower than the virgin PBT composition. The average difference in the capillary viscosities (at 1520/s) of the 2 sets of compositions is approximately 46 Pa-s.<br>
Figure 2 shows the trend of the notched izod impact strength that was obtained for various glass filled molding compositions (containing different ratios of low iv and high iv PBT) versus the capillary viscosity at 1520/s for the glass filled virgin PBT and modified PBT compositions. The surprising observation for the dataset is that the modified PBT composition of the same value of notched izod impact strength displays a lower viscosity than the regular PBT composition. This is a highly advantageous property of the modified PBT molding composition since it offers a flow advantage while offering the same impact strength.<br>
EXAMPLES 20-26<br>
Experiments were carried out with small quantity of additives to increase the heat deflection temperature of 'PET derived PBT' compositions.<br>
EXAMPLE 20-25 and Comparative Example 26<br>
The ingredients of the examples shown in Table 13, were extruded on a 64 mm Single Screw Extruder with a vacuum vented mixing screw, at a barrel and the head temperature between 240 and 265 °C and 150 to 300 rpm screw speed. The extruder had 1 feeder to feed the blend and can be operated at a maximum rate of 100 lbs/hr (45kg/hr). The extrudate was cooled through a water bath prior to pelletizing. Test parts were injection molded on a van Dorn molding machine with a set temperature of approximately 240 to 265 °C. The pellets were dried for 3-4 hours at 120 °C in a forced air circulating oven prior to injection molding. Table 13 shows relevant details.<br>

Testing Procedures<br>
The compositions were subjected to testing in accordance to the testing procedures used in Examples 2-5. The properties obtained from the filled composition with various additives are as shown in Table 14.<br>
Table 14<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The comparison between Examples 25 and 26 without any nucleating additives, shows that heat deflection temperature (HDT) of glass-filled composition with 'PET drived PBT' was about 10°C lower than that with virgin PBT.<br>
Examples 20-24 in Table 12 demonstrate a method to increase the HDT by adding a small quantity of additives. Especially, a small quantity of inorganic fillers were added to the composition with 'PET derived PBT' as shown in Examples 20 and 22-24.<br>
In Examples 22-24, a small quantity of ULTRATALC talc additive with average particle size at less than 0.9 micro-meter substantially increased the HDT of the 'PET derived PBT' composition. Another inorganic compound, antimony oxide (Sb2O3) with a particle size of 1.25jim was also found to be effective additive to increase the HDT as shown in example 20. Inorganic fillers with large surface area may accelerate the nucleation rate of 'PET drived PBT' to enhance the HDT. It was also found that a polymeric material could be used to increase the HDT of 'PET drived PBT'. Poly(tetrafluoro ethylene) in example 20 increased the HDT and also improved some physical properties such as modulus and tensile strength.<br>
EXAMPLES 27-31 Compositions of Different PET derived PBT Comonomer Loadings<br>
Purpose - The purpose of these experiments were to produce a PET derived PBT copolymer with different amounts of comonomer loadings. It is known that the materials having a melting point greater than 200°C exhibit useful engineering thermoplastic type properties. Thus, all the examples below show that useful PET derived PBT copolymers (melting point greater than 200°C) can be synthesized. The process to produce these materials is shown below (Pilot Plant Process). Examples 27-31 used the recipes as indicated in Table 15.<br>
Table 15: Raw material amount details used for Examples 27-31 (PET derived PBT) (Table Removed)<br>
Pilot Plant Process<br>
A modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer was derived from a polyethylene terephthalate component at larger scale in a helicone reactor. The helicone reactor had a capacity of 40 liters and was equipped with a special design of twin opposing helical blades with 270 degree twist; constructed of 316 SS with 16g polish finish. The blade speed could be varied from 1 to 65 rpm. The agitators were connected to a 7.5 HP Constant Torque Inverter Duty Motor which operates at 230/460 VAC, 3 PH and 60 Hz. These agitators provided excellent surface area for the polymer melt in order to build molecular weight. The helicone was also designed with an overhead condenser to condense the vapors in the glycolysis, transesterification (if any) and polymerization stages.<br>
25 lbs (11.4 kgs) of recycle PET pellets with 35 lbs (15.9 kgs) of butanediol (molar ratio 2.9:1) were charged to the helicone reactor. 4.6 ml (100 ppm as Ti) of TPT catalyst were also added to the reaction mix. The temperature of the heating oil (for the helicone) was set to 250 C. The agitator speed was set at 67 % of maximum. The butanediol was<br>
refluxed into the reactor for 2 hours. It should be noted that the design of the overhead condenser system did not allow a complete reflux of the butanediol. As a result, about 5 lbs (2.3kgs) to 10 lbs (4.5kgs) of butanediol evolved in the initial stages could not be refluxed. The butanediol evolved after that could be completely refluxed into the reactor.<br>
For the polymerization stage (also referred to in this draft as 'poly stage'), a vacuum was applied to the helicone reactor and the reflux of butanediol to the reactor was discontinued. The speed of the agitator was set to 60 % of max and the target amps of the motor were 3.5 amps. The logic for changes in agitator speed as the molecular weight of the polymer built up is shown in Table 3. The system pressure was brought down to 0.5 Torr (0.066 kPa) by the vacuum blower. The reaction was carried out until the polymer mass reached its 3rd build. The reaction was stopped after 15 minutes into the 3rd build and the polymer was cast in blobs. The products were then allowed to dry and ground into pellets. The following tests were conducted on the polymer sample:, iv measurement, NMR analysis and DSC analysis. These results can be seen in Table 16.<br>

Examples 32-36 were synthesized using resins from Examples 27-31 respectively. The formulation for Examples 32-36 is shown below in Table 17.<br>
Example 32-36:<br>
The ingredients of the examples shown below in Tables 17, were extruded on a Second Generation 30 mm co-rotating twin-screw extruder. This extruder is fitted with 9 barrel sections (L/D = 29) and 2 feeders for introducing raw materials to the feed throat. Typically the materials were fed to the extruder at a rate between 30 lbs(13.6 kgs) and 60 lbs(27.3 kgs) per hour. The screw speed is typically adjusted to a value between 300 and 500 RPM. To minimize the specific energy and residence time of the material, the exact combination of feed rate and screw speed are selected to produce high feed rate and high torque. Compounded pellets were dried for 3-4 hours at 250 °F(121 °C) in an air-circulating oven prior to molding. A van Dorn injection-molding machine was used with following temperature profile (rear to front): 554 °F (290 °C), 570 °F (299 °C), 570 °F (299 °C), 590 °F (310 °C). Typical settings were as follows: 100 rpm screw speed, 600 psi(421,800 kg/m2) hold pressure, 75 psi(52,725 kg/m2) back pressure, and 30 sec cycle times. Temperatures at the front of the barrel and hold/back pressures were adjusted to accommodate differences in the processability between formulations. All standard parts were 0.125"(3.12mm) thick.<br>

It is known for commercial reasons, molding compositions having HDT(at 0.455MPa) greater than 180°C are useful. A molding composition as shown in Example 36 was made using PET derived PBT having a total comonomer content at 17.2 equivalents of a residue selected from the group of isophthalic acid groups, ethylene glycol groups, and diethylene glycol groups, and combinations thereof, relative to the total of 100 equivalents of diol and 100 equivalents of diacid groups in the modified polybutylene terephthalate random copolymer. The HDT(at 0.455MPa) value for this composition was observed to be 183.4°C. It is also interesting to note that the tensile modulus for all examples shown in Table 18 have approximately the same value. This proves that having a higher comonomer content in the PET derived PBT has minimal impact on tensile modulus of the molding compositions.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other variations are possible. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the versions contained therein.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
