Description<br>
Method and arrangement for determination of the radio coverage<br>
in a multicell mobile radio system<br>
The invention relates to a method for determination of the<br>
radio coverage in a multicell mobile radio system as claimed in<br>
the precharacterizing clause of patent claim 1, to an<br>
arrangement for determination of the radio coverage in a<br>
multicell mobile radio system as claimed in the<br>
precharacterizing clause of patent claim 10, and to use of the<br>
method for finding the position of a mobile terminal.<br>
In communication and information technology, terminals, that is<br>
to say by way of example cordless telephones, mobile radios,<br>
computers, PDAs etc., are frequently operated in a mobile form,<br>
and are operated by means of a radio link to a base station, a<br>
so-called access point. In order to enlarge the geographical<br>
field of use of a mobile terminal such as this, and in order to<br>
increase the amount of data or information which can be<br>
transmitted at the same time (bandwidth) , a plurality of base<br>
stations are frequently used at the same time, with one mobile<br>
terminal being operated alternately between them. Arrangements<br>
such as these are frequently referred to as multicell mobile<br>
radio systems and are known in the form of DECT systems for<br>
cordless telephones, GSM networks for mobile radios (cellular<br>
telephones) and, for example, in the form of WLAN networks for<br>
data communication. Conventional multicell mobile radio systems<br>
in this case have the common feature that the individual radio<br>
cells, that is to say the areas in which the individual base<br>
stations can be received, overlap one another, so that a mobile<br>
terminal can be moved through the multicell mobile radio<br>
system, with a connection being able to be handed over from one<br>
base station to another base station in an overlap area between<br>
two radio cells. Particularly in geographically<br><br>
small radio networks, it is possible in this case to even be<br>
able.<br><br>
to receive all of the base stations at some or all locations.<br>
When designing a multicell mobile radio system, care must be<br>
taken to ensure that at least one of the base stations can be<br>
received with an adequate reception field strength at every<br>
location at which a mobile terminal may be intended to operate.<br>
Ideally (free-field) , it is possible in this case to assume<br>
that the reception field strength is distributed radially<br>
symmetrically around a base station, so that base stations are<br>
often arranged approximately in a square grid on an area to be<br>
supplied, so that each base station covers a radio cell with a<br>
hexagonal outline, at whose center it is arranged. <br>
In practice, the propagation of radio waves is frequently<br>
adversely affected by buildings, the landscape and other<br>
elements. Furthermore, the radio base stations do not all have<br>
the same transmission power, and do not emit the radio waves<br>
radially symmetrically, either. For this reason, radio networks<br>
are frequently designed on the basis of rough approximations<br>
and on the basis of "provisional" empirical values, and are<br>
then "surveyed", that is to say the available reception field<br>
strength is recorded by means of a measurement receiver at a<br>
multiplicity of measurement points, in order to use these<br>
measurement results to successively optimize the radio network.<br>
Such recording of the radio coverage is in this case associated<br>
with a large amount of often manual effort and, furthermore,<br>
must be repeated whenever the radio network itself is changed<br>
or an influencing factor (for example local buildings) changes.<br>
Attempts are frequently made to reduce the effects of these<br>
disadvantages by "overdesigning" radio networks, that is to<br>
say, for example, by choosing the transmission power of the<br>
radio base stations to be higher than necessary, or by using an<br>
unnecessarily large number of base stations. This is, of<br>
course, associated with greater costs and with greater emission<br>
of radio-frequency electromagnetic waves.<br><br>
The data relating to the recorded radio coverage is used not<br>
only to ensure area coverage of a radio network but also to<br>
find the position of mobile terminals. In the simplest case,<br>
the mobile terminal is in this case interrogated via the radio<br>
network for the identification numbers of all the base stations<br>
which can be received at the present time at its location. In<br>
this case, the location of the mobile terminal is emitted as an<br>
area which corresponds to the intersection area of all the<br>
radio areas (reception areas) of the identified base stations.<br>
The position-finding accuracy therefore decreases as the size<br>
of the reception areas of the base stations increases.<br>
In the document DE 10 2004 010JL82 B3, the stationary base<br>
stations in a radio network are used to record the radio<br>
coverage. This saves manual measurements and ensures adequate<br>
radio coverage in many cases. However, the method provides only<br>
a small amount of information about the radio field strengths<br>
between the base stations.<br>
In known multicell mobile radio systems, it has<br>
disadvantageously been found that the radio coverage must be<br>
recorded frequently and precisely for reliable operation, and<br>
such recording is associated with a large amount of effort.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to reduce the<br>
effort required to determine the radio coverage in a multicell<br>
mobile radio system.<br>
The object is achieved by a method as claimed in patent claim 1<br>
and by an arrangement as claimed in patent claim 10.<br>
The achievement of the object is based on a method for<br>
determination of the radio coverage in a multicell mobile radio<br>
system having a multiplicity of base stations, wherein the<br>
actual reception field strength of a plurality or all of the<br>
base stations is measured at each of a plurality of actual<br><br>
measurement points, which are each at different locations, and<br>
wherein the measured values of the actual reception field<br>
strengths are entered as actual values on a position-related<br>
basis in a database. In this case, values which have in each<br>
case been interpolated by means of an interpolation method, for<br>
the reception field strengths of a plurality or all of the base<br>
stations are calculated from the actual reception field<br>
strengths for virtual measurement points which are located<br>
between the measurement points and the base stations, and are<br>
entered in the database. Furthermore, substitute values for the<br>
reception field strength are calculated for further<br>
geographical points at which neither measured nor interpolated<br>
values are available for the reception field strengths, with<br>
the substitute values being calculated on the basis of the<br>
respective transmission power, on the basis of the range to the<br>
respective base station from this geographical, and on the<br>
basis of a propagation model, and with the substitute values<br>
calculated in this way being entered in the database. The use<br>
of a method such as this makes it possible to make a statement<br>
about the base stations which can be received at a respective<br>
geographical, and about their reception field strengths, by<br>
means of a comparatively small number of measurement points<br>
("support points") for a comparatively large number of<br>
geographicals. "Real" measured values are preferably used in<br>
this case, with interpolated values being added to them, which<br>
have been produced from the actual measured values and,<br>
furthermore, with the database having added to it calculated<br>
values for those locations at which neither measured values nor<br>
interpolated values can be determined. The method therefore<br>
results, for every location, in values for the radio coverage<br>
which very accurately match the actual circumstances, despite<br>
there being only a small number of actual measurement points.<br>
The object is also achieved by an arrangement for determination<br>
of the radio coverage in a multicell mobile radio system having<br>
a plurality of base stations, having a plurality of<br><br>
actual measurement points, and having a memory device for a<br>
multiplicity of reception field strength values. In the<br>
arrangement, an evaluation device is<br><br>
provided, and is designed to detect and store actual values for<br>
the reception field strength of the base stations at the actual<br>
measurement points, wherein the evaluation device is designed<br>
for interpolation of virtual measured values, which are formed<br>
from the actual measured values, for virtual measurement points<br>
which are located between the measurement points, wherein the<br>
evaluation device is designed to calculate substitute values<br>
for the reception field strength at further points on the basis<br>
of the transmission power of the base stations, on the basis of<br>
the respective range from the virtual measurement points to the<br>
base stations and on the basis of a propagation model, and<br>
wherein the detection device is designed to enter the actual<br>
measured values, with virtual measured values and the<br>
substitute values, as well as the location details about the<br>
respective support point associated with them, in the memory-<br>
device. An arrangement such as this allows detailed and<br>
accurate data to be determined about the radio coverage of a<br>
multicell mobile radio system, with a small number of<br>
measurement points.<br>
The object is also achieved by a method for finding the<br>
position of a mobile terminal in a multicell mobile radio<br>
system, in which, in a first step, the radio coverage of the<br>
multicell mobile radio system is determined using the method as<br>
outlined above, and in which, in a second step, the mobile<br>
terminal detects the reception field strength or a plurality or<br>
all of the base stations which can be received, and in which,<br>
in a third step, the reception field strengths which have been<br>
detected by the mobile terminal are compared with the<br>
determined radio coverage, with that measurement point being<br>
output as the location of the mobile radio whose determined<br>
reception field strength values best match the reception field<br>
strength values detected by the mobile terminal. This method<br>
makes it possible to record the position of the mobile terminal<br>
with high accuracy.<br><br>
Advantageous refinements of the method are specified in patent<br>
claims 2 to 8. The features and advantages.<br><br>
described in this case also apply in the same sense to the<br>
method as claimed in patent claim 9 and to the arrangement<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The actual reception field strengths are advantageously<br>
measured at the locations of the base stations. This means that<br>
it is possible to use an orthogonal grid, for example in the<br>
form of a table, for storage and interpolation of measured<br>
values. In this case, it is particularly simple for the actual<br>
reception field strengths to be measured by the base stations,<br>
with one of the base stations in each case being used<br>
alternately as the measurement device for measurement of the<br>
reception field strength of at least one of the other base<br>
stations. This allows the measured values to be transmitted to<br>
an evaluation device via the network infrastructure, that is to<br>
say for example via the "backbone" of the base station.<br>
Furthermore, this means that there is no need for additional<br>
measurement receivers or for walking or driving around the<br>
multicell mobile radio system associated with them.<br>
Both the propagation model, by means of which a position-<br>
related reception field strength can be estimated on the basis<br>
of the transmission power of base stations and on the basis of<br>
the range values to the base stations, and the interpolation<br>
method for estimation of values for the reception field<br>
strength between actual measurement points therefore provide<br>
more accurate values the better the method that is used<br>
(propagation model, interpolation method) is matched to the<br>
actual circumstances. Actual values are advantageously used for<br>
selection and/or for correction of the propagation model that<br>
is used and/or of the interpolation method that is used, and of<br>
their respective parameters. A simple interpolation method can<br>
be used if the virtual measurement points are arranged on<br>
straight connecting lines between actual measurement points.<br><br>
Equidistant intervals are in this case advantageously chosen<br>
between the virtual measurement points.<br>
The precision of the method can be further improved by entering<br>
and taking account of special topographical features.<br><br>
for the propagation model and/or for the interpolation method.<br>
By way of example, walls or ceilings of buildings, which<br>
normally attenuate radio signals, can be included as<br>
attenuation elements or as virtual paths in the propagation<br>
model.<br>
A field strength matrix is advantageously formed from the<br>
actual values, the interpolated values and the calculated<br>
values for the reception field strengths stored in the<br>
database. In this case, a field strength matrix such as this<br>
can be further processed particularly easily if the field-<br>
strength values recorded in it are linked to an orthogonal and<br>
equidistant geographic grid.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the method according to the invention<br>
will be explained in the following text with reference to the<br>
drawings. In the figures, which are at the same time intended<br>
to be used to explain an arrangement according to the<br>
invention:<br>

radio system, and the measurements of the reception<br>

Figure 5 shows a schematic illustration for finding the<br>
position of a mobile terminal in a multicell mobile<br>
radio system.<br>
The process of determining radio coverage as described in the<br>
following text can be used on the one hand to optimize the<br>
multicell mobile radio system and on the other hand to find the<br>
position of a mobile terminal. The multicell mobile radio<br>
system considered in the following text is an arrangement based<br>
on the DECT Standard having a plurality of base stations, a so-<br>
called DECT multicell system. However, the method can also be<br>
used for other radio networks, for example GSM, UMTS, WLAN or<br>
WiMax networks.<br>
One such multicell mobile radio system is illustrated<br>
schematically in Figure la, with base stations AP1...AP9 (access<br>
points) being arranged in an orthogonal grid over a land area.<br>
In this case, the distances between the individual base<br>
stations AP1..AP9, the respective transmission power and the<br>
respective polar diagram of the base stations APLAP9 are<br>
known. The present exemplary embodiment is based, for<br>
simplicity, on the assumption that the base Stations &amp;P1MIA.P2<br>
are arranged in a square grid, all operate using the same<br>
transmission power, and have a radially symmetrical propagation<br>
characteristic over the horizontal area.<br>
The method described in the following text is based on<br>
measurement of the reception field strengths of all the<br>
receivable base stations AP1..AP9 for different (actual<br><br>
measurement points), so-called support points. As an<br>
alternative to the option of	<br><br>
carrying out these measurements manually by walking over the<br>
land area with the measurement receiver, this makes use of the<br>
capability to successively switch one of the base stations<br>
AP1...AP9 in each case to a measurement mode, and to record the<br>
reception field strength at the location of each of the other<br>
base stations AP1...AP9. In this case, it is not possible, of<br>
course, to record the reception field strength of the base<br>
station AP1...AP9 which is in each case carrying out the<br>
measurement; however, it is self-evident that the reception<br>
field strength of the respective base station corresponds to a<br>
maximum value in the vicinity of that respective location,<br>
resulting inter alia from the transmission power of the<br>
respective base station AP1...AP9.<br>
The reception field strengths of the respectively other base<br>
stations AP1...AP9 as measured by the base stations AP1...AP9 are<br>
stored in a database (not illustrated) for an evaluation<br>
device, which in this case is a component of a communication<br>
system (likewise not illustrated) to which the base stations<br>
AP1...AP9 are connected. The measured-value pairs stored there<br>
are shown in the form of a table in Figure lb, in which case<br>
the asymmetry of some of the measured values indicates that,<br>
despite the orthogonal arrangement of the base stations<br>
AP1..AP9, the "ideal" radially symmetrical propagation of the<br>
radio waves ana of ttie homogeneous transmission power does not<br>
necessarily result in a radio field corresponding to the<br>
theory. For example, the base station AP6 can be received at<br>
-65 dBm at the location of the base station AP7 while, in<br>
contrast, the base station AP7 can be received at -60 dBm at<br>
the location of the base station AP6. This "asymmetry" may be<br>
caused on the one hand by special geographic features (for<br>
example obstructions in the form of buildings, plants etc.,)<br>
and on the other hand the discrepancy from the "ideal state"<br>
may be caused by measured tolerances or for some similar<br>
reason.<br><br>
The base stations AP1...AP9 known from Figure la are shown again<br>
in Figure 2. A (theoretical) reception field strength is<br>
calculated from the (known) transmission powers of the base<br>
stations AP1...AP9 for all the support points _.	■ —	•-■-<br><br>
which are represented by black dots in the figure, that is to<br>
say the radio field strength with which each base station can<br>
supposedly be received is calculated for each of the<br>
illustrated points. The present example is based on a simple<br>
propagation model which assumes that the reception field<br>
strength for a base station decreases continuously as the range<br>
from this base station increases, to be precise radially<br>
symmetrically around the respective base station. Different<br>
propagation models may, of course, also be used as the basis,<br>
in particular those which take account of special geographic<br>
features, for example buildings or the like.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, the geographical points<br>
for the "theoretical" substitute values for the reception field<br>
strengths are likewise arranged in an orthogonal grid, to be<br>
precise such that a geographical for the support points for the<br>
substitute values is also in each case arranged for each<br>
position of the base stations. This means that not only is a<br>
set of the actually measured reception field strengths of the<br>
other base stations AP1...AP9 available for each geographic<br>
position of a base station, but also a set of values which have<br>
been calculated on the basis of the propagation model. Ideally,<br>
the actually measured values and the calculated values should<br>
be identical; in practice, there are, of course, discrepancies<br>
which are caused on the one hand by measurement tolerances and<br>
on the other hand by the discrepancies which obviously exist<br>
between a theoretical model and practical propagation. Since,<br>
however, on the one hand model parameters and on the other<br>
initial values in the form of transmission field strengths and<br>
transmission powers, possibly as well as geographic details,<br>
are used as the basis for the propagation model and the<br>
algorithms that result from this for calculation of the<br>
substitute values, these parameters that are used for<br>
calculation purposes can optionally be corrected by means of<br>
the measured values.<br><br>
In the abovementioned situation, in which the grid of<br>
calculated substitute values is identical to the grid in which<br>
the measurements are carried out, the calculated substitute<br>
values for_	<br><br>
each point for which there is a measured value are replaced by<br>
that measured value, and are entered in the database. In the<br>
situation where the grids are not precisely coincidental,<br>
substitute values are replaced by measured values which are in<br>
the vicinity, provided that the geographic discrepancy is less<br>
than a threshold value (so-called "catchment area"). In<br>
consequence, the "support points" which are recorded in the<br>
database are also in a standard orthogonal grid when the grids<br>
for the substitute values and for the measured values are<br>
shifted with respect to one another or have a different<br>
stepwidth (grid size).<br>
The multicell mobile radio system can be improved (optimized)<br>
after its initial installation just on the basis of the<br>
measured "real" values and on the basis of. the substitute<br>
values, by adjusting the number and position of the base<br>
stations AP1...AP9 and their transmission powers such that at<br>
least one or two base stations AP1...AP9 can be received with a<br>
minimum reception field strength at each support point and<br>
therefore also with a high probability at each point between<br>
the support points. Such optimization, in particular the<br>
optimization of the parameters for the propagation model which<br>
may be associated with this, is repeated whenever the<br>
geographic conditions change, for example as a result of<br>
building changes being carried out, or when base stations<br>
AP1..AP9 are changed or moved.<br>
Figure 2 has been used as the basis to explain that it can be<br>
assumed for those geographicals which match neither the base<br>
stations AP1...AP9 nor those points for which substitute values<br>
have been calculated that the conditions (reception field<br>
strengths) are similar there to those at the adjacent points<br>
(support points) for which values have already been entered in<br>
the database (measured values, substitute values). This is<br>
often also sufficient to ensure a minimum reception<br><br>
field strength, particularly when values for the reception<br>
field strength which go beyond the required minimum level are<br>
available at the "known" support points«	<br><br>
Nevertheless, particularly for radio position-finding purposes,<br>
it is desirable to have more accurate information for the<br>
reception field strength at those points which are located<br>
between the support points which are known as a result of<br>
measurements or those "estimated" in calculations based on<br>
models.<br>
In addition to the actually measured values and the substitute<br>
values, which are calculated for each base station AP1...AP9 from<br>
this transmission power of the base station and the distance to<br>
the base station AP1...AP9 a third type of value is formed for<br>
the reception field strength by interpolation from actual<br>
measured values, specifically the so-called interpolated<br>
values. Figure 3 schematically illustrates the interpolation<br>
for such interpolated values on the basis of the distance<br>
between the base stations API and AP7. This is done by firstly<br>
reading from the table in Figure lb that value with which the<br>
base station AP7 can be received at the location of the base<br>
station API, in this case -65 dBm. This value, which is<br>
measured by the base station API itself in the present<br>
exemplary embodiment, represents the initial value for the<br>
interpolation. Another parameter for the interpolation is the<br>
magnitude of the distance between the base stations API and AP7<br>
and the number of support points to be calculated, in this case<br>
five, from which an appropriate stepwidth is obtained. In<br>
addition to the first support point, which results from the<br>
measurement result of the base station API (-65 dBm), at least<br>
one further support point is required for interpolation, in<br>
this case the value measured by the base station AP4, with the<br>
base station AP4 being located on the direct path between the<br>
base stations API and AP7. The base station AP7 can be received<br>
at -50 dBm at the location of the base station AP4; this value<br>
is used as the "virtual measurement point" 7.3, so that the<br>
virtual measurement points 7.1 and 7.2 are determined by linear<br>
interpolation, and are entered in the table or database.<br><br>
Interpolated values can once again be interpolated for the path<br>
between the measurement point 7.3, which, strictly speaking, is<br>
a virtual measurement point and an actual measurement point at<br>
the same time, and the location of the base station AP7, with a<br>
value,	—■—<br><br>
having to be estimated for the reception field strength at the<br>
location of the base station AP7 because no actual measured<br>
value is available for this. Alternatively, the values 7.4 etc.<br>
can also be extrapolated from the first step (values 7.1, 7.2);<br>
there is then no "estimate" for the support point for the base<br>
station AP7.<br>
A large number of interpolated values for virtual measurement<br>
points can be calculated using this method for all direct paths<br>
between the base stations AP1...AP9, in which case these<br>
interpolated values differ, statistically on average, less from<br>
reality than the calculated values, because the interpolated<br>
values use actual measured values as support points.<br>
If there is no intention of increasing the number of support<br>
points for the database, substitute values recorded in the<br>
database are replaced by the corresponding interpolated values<br>
at the respective support points unless an actual measured<br>
value is available for the respective support point. If the<br>
geographic position of the respective interpolated value in<br>
this case does not precisely match a grid point for the<br>
substitute values (non-coincident grids), the value can<br>
nevertheless be replaced provided that the discrepancy<br>
(distance) between the two points is below a threshold value,<br>
for example 2 meters. In consequence, the database contains not<br>
only the field strength values but also their grid size and<br>
their orthogonal structure, which simplifies subsequently use<br>
of the database.<br>
The result of the production of values for the reception field<br>
strengths using all three method elements described so far is<br>
summarized in Figure 4. In this case, the black, solid circles<br>
ShOW geographicalS for which calculated values are used for the<br>
reception field strengths of all the base stations AP1...AP9.<br>
Actual measured values are used at those points which are<br><br>
represented by squares and in this exemplary embodiment<br>
coincide with the locations of the base stations AP1...AP9, with<br>
the respective exception of the reception field______	<br><br>
strengths of those base stations which are located at the<br>
respective point itself. Finally, as can be seen from Figure lb,<br>
there are no measured values on the diagonal of the table.<br>
Finally, the measurement points (support points) for<br>
interpolated values are shown for virtually all the points<br>
between the base stations AP1...AP9 which are represented by<br>
crossed-through circles, and, wherever they are available, these<br>
interpolated values are used by preference over the calculated<br>
values. The associated database therefore has a set with nine<br>
values for the reception field strengths of the nine base<br>
stations AP1..AP9 for each of the points illustrated in Figure 4,<br>
with each of these values matching reality as well as possible.<br>
Figure 5 schematically illustrates the process of finding the<br>
position (locating) a mobile terminal in the multicell mobile<br>
radio system which is formed from the base stations AP1..AP9. For<br>
position finding, the mobile terminal receives via its radio<br>
interface a command, in response to whose reception the mobile<br>
terminal MT transmits back a data record which in this case<br>
comprises nine measured values, with the nine measured values<br>
comprising the reception field strength for each of the nine<br>
received base stations AP1...AP9. An evaluation device (not<br>
illustrated) in a central server now compares the data records<br>
from the database with the data record produced by the mobile<br>
terminal MT, and in this case uses the database to determine<br>
that data record which is closest to the measured data record.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, the difference is formed<br>
for this purpose for each base station AP1..AP9 between the<br>
measured value and the value in the database, to be precise for<br>
each measurement point (support point) that is available in the<br>
database. The sum of the squares of the discrepancies for the<br>
base stations AP1...AP9 is formed, and is stored as a value, for<br>
each available measurement point. That measurement point which<br>
has the smallest value is assumed to be the one which is closest<br>
to the current location of the mobile terminal MT.<br><br>
As an alternative to this simple calculation method, it is also<br>
possible to use other calculation methods. In particular, it is<br>
possible to determine a small number of close measurement<br>
points and to once again carry out an interpolation process, in<br>
order to produce further virtual measurement points, between<br>
the individual field strength values at these measurement<br>
points. In order to output the position that has been<br>
determined in this way, it is helpful to store coordinate<br>
details and/or a location identification for each measurement<br>
point in the database. Alternatively, the database can be used<br>
to store only those measurement points which, for example,<br>
correspond to a square grid, so that a specific location can be<br>
deduced by an order number of the corresponding data record in<br>
the database--	 "	'	—	<br><br>
