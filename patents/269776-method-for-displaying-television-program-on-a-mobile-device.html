FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication technology Particularly the present invention describes a protocol for transmitting the TV Program on the mobile screen and also the framework in TV and mobile device for sending, receiving and presentation of the TV program. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of displaying TV program on a mobile device.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
According  to  a   US   Patent titled   "System  for dual-display  interaction  with<br>
.integrated television and internet content" discloses a Systems and methods for<br>
i[ using two or more cooperating but physically independent displays for enhanced<br>
ii<br>
viewing of data streams, where the viewing on one display does not interfere with the viewing on the other displays. The type of data streams can be complex streams such as multiple televisions (TV) broadcast signals or other video signals, internet data, or other local data such as information related to the state of a consumer's home appliances. The signals can include data embedded in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) for analog signals, or in dedicated slots in a digital signal according to protocols such as MPEG. The system includes a hand-held  and  portable  remote control with  a  motion  picture display,  and<br><br>
hardware and/or software<br><br>
enabling interaction between a primary display (such<br><br>
as a TV) and the hand-held display. The hardware can include an integrated TV<br><br>
.tuner, or a physically separate base station having a TV tuner, in which case the base station and the remote control would communicate via radio frequency<br>
(RF).	I<br>
In   another US patent titled "Picture-in-picture television receiver" A picture-in-<br>
l picture television receiver is disclosed in which a television picture to be inset is<br>
compressed at a compression rate of 1/n and inset as a small-picture in part of a<br>
|i main television picture or! large picture, and a single field memory for small-<br>
I,<br>
picture reproduction is provided therein in or from which a video signal can be randomly read and written line by line as a unit. In the single field memory is stored the small-picture video signal line by line by the application of a writing clock in which case the time taken in the writing is less than 1/(n+1) of a horizontal period. Then, from the memory is read the stored small-picture information by the application of a reading clock of n times the frequency of the writing clock during the time that writing is not performed, and supplied to be inset in the main television picture, A small-capacity buffer memory is provided at the prestage or following stage of the field memory to prevent the read/write timing overlap<br>
.Currently if a member at home is watching a TV channel, and another member wants to see some information in some other channel, the second channel is shown as a small display overlapping the current channel contents. This<br>
degrades the user experience in viewing the TV Program. Also in Picture -in<br>
I  â–  Picture the sound of the second channel cannot be heard.<br><br>
The above first Patent requires a base station with a tuner to be connected to the TV.<br>
Currently only viewing two channels simultaneously Is defined.<br>
The current system does not have any mechanism to identify the user connected to the secondary device.<br>
