FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to coding of multi-channel representations of audio<br>
signals using spatial parameters. The invention teaches new methods for<br>
defining and estimating parameters for recreating a multi-channel signal from a<br>
number of channels being less than the number of output channels. In particular<br>
it aims at minimizing the bitrate for the multi-channel representation, and<br>
providing a coded representation of the multi-channel signal enabling easy<br>
encoding and decoding of the data for all possible channel configurations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With a growing interest for multi-channel audio in e.g. broadcasting systems, the<br>
demand for a digital low bitrate audio coding technique is obvious. It has been<br>
shown in PCT/SE02/01372 "Efficient and scalable Parametric Stereo Coding for<br>
Low Bitrate Audio Coding Applications", that it is possible to re-create a stereo<br>
image that closely resembles the original stereo image, from a mono downmix<br>
signal and an additional very compact parametric representation of the stereo<br>
image. The basic principle is to divide the input signal into- frequency bands and<br>
time segments, and for these frequency bands and time segments, estimate<br>
inter-channel intensity difference (IID), and inter-channel coherence (ICC), the<br>
first parameter being a measurement of the power distribution between the two<br>
channels in the specific frequency band and the second parameter being an<br>
estimation of the correlation between the two channels for the specific frequency<br>
band. On the	<br><br>
decoder side the stereo image is recreated from the mono<br>
signal by distributing the mono signal between the two<br>
output channels in accordance with the transmitted IID-<br>
data, and by adding a decorrelated ambience signal in order<br>
to retain the channel correlation properties of the<br>
original stereo channels.<br>
Several matrixing techniques exist that create multi-<br>
channel output from stereo signals. These techniques often<br>
rely on phase differences to create the back channels.<br>
Often, the back channels are delayed slightly compared to<br>
the front channels. To maximise performance the stereo file<br>
is created using special down mixing rules on the encoder<br>
side from a multi-channel signal to two stereo base<br>
channels. These systems generally have a stable front sound<br>
image with some ambience sound in the back channels and<br>
there is a limited ability to separate complex sound<br>
material into different speakers.<br>
Several multi-channel configurations exist. The most<br>
commonly known configuration is the 5.1 configuration<br>
(centre channel, front left/right, surround left/right, and<br>
the LFE channel). ITU-R BS.775 defines several down-mix<br>
schemes for obtaining a channel configuration comprising<br>
fewer channels than a given channel configuration. Instead<br>
of always having to decode all channels and rely on a down-<br>
mix, it can be desirable to have a multi-channel<br>
representation that enables a receiver to extract the<br>
parameters relevant for the playback channel configuration<br>
at hand, prior to decoding the channels. Another<br>
alternative is to have parameters that can map to any<br>
speaker combination at the decoder side. Furthermore, a<br>
parameter set that is inherently scaleable is desirable<br>
from a scalable or embedded coding point of view, where it<br>
is e.g. possible to store the data corresponding to the<br>
surround channels in an enhancement layer in the bitstream.<br><br>
Another representation of multi-channel signals using a sum<br>
signal or down mix signal and additional parametric side<br>
information is known in the art as binaural cue coding<br>
(BCC). This technique is described in "Binaural Cue Coding<br>
Part 1: Psycho-Acoustic Fundamentals and Design<br>
Principles", IEEE Transactions on Speech and- Audio<br>
Processing, vol. 11, No. 6, November 2003, F. Baumgarte,<br>
C. Faller, and "Binaural Cue Coding. Part II: Schemes and<br>
Applications", IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio<br>
Processing vol. 11, No. 6, November 2003, C. Faller and<br>
F. Baumgarte.<br>
Generally, binaural cue coding is a method for multi-<br>
channel spatial rendering based on one down-mixed audio<br>
channel and side information. Several parameters to be<br>
calculated by a BCC encoder and to be used by a BCC decoder<br>
for audio reconstruction or audio rendering include inter-<br>
channel level differences, inter-channel time differences,<br>
and inter-channel coherence parameters. These inter-channel<br>
cues are the determining factor for the perception of a<br>
spatial image. These parameters are given for blocks of<br>
time samples of the original multi-channel signal and are<br>
also given frequency-selective so that each block of multi-<br>
channel signal samples have several cues for several<br>
frequency bands. In the general case of C playback<br>
channels, the inter-channel level differences and the<br>
inter-channel time differences are considered in each<br>
subband between pairs of channels, i.e., for each channel<br>
relative to a reference channel. One channel is defined as<br>
the reference channel for each inter-channel level<br>
difference. With the inter-channel level differences and<br>
the inter-channel time differences, it is possible to<br>
render a source to any direction between one of the<br>
loudspeaker pairs of a playback set-up that is used. For<br>
determining the width or diffuseness of a rendered source,<br>
it is enough to consider one parameter per subband for all<br>
audio channels. This parameter is the inter-channel<br>
coherence parameter. The width of the rendered source is<br><br>
controlled by modifying the subband signals such that all<br>
possible channel pairs have the same inter-channel<br>
coherence parameter.<br>
In 3CC coding, all inter-channel level differences are<br>
determined between the reference channel 1 and any other<br>
channel. When, for example, the centre channel is<br>
determined to be the reference channel, a first inter-<br>
channel level difference between the left channel and the<br>
centre channel, a second inter-channel level difference<br>
between the right channel and the centre channel, a third<br>
inter-channel level difference between the left surround<br>
channel and the centre channel, and a forth inter-channel<br>
level difference between the right surround channel and the<br>
centre channel are calculated. This scenario describes a<br>
five-channel scheme. When the five-channel scheme<br>
additionally includes a low frequency enhancement channel,<br>
which is also known as a "sub-woofer" channel, a fifth<br>
inter-channels level difference between the low frequency<br>
enhancement channel and the centre channel, which is the<br>
single reference channel, is calculated.<br>
When reconstructing the original multi-channel using the<br>
single down mix channel, which is also termed as the "mono"<br>
channel, and the transmitted cues such as ICLD<br>
(Interchannel Level Difference), ICTD (Interchannel Time<br>
Difference), and ICC (Interchannel Coherence), the spectral<br>
coefficients of the mono signal are modified using these<br>
cues. The level modification is performed using a positive<br>
real number determining the level modification for each<br>
spectral coefficient. The inter-channel time difference is<br>
generated using a complex number of magnitude of one<br>
determining a phase modification for each spectral<br>
coefficient. Another function determines the coherence<br>
influence. The factors for level modifications of each<br>
channel are computed by firstly calculating the factor for<br>
the reference channel. The factor for the reference channel<br>
is computed such that for each frequency partition, the sum<br><br>
of the power of all channels is the same as the power of<br>
the sum signal. Then, based on the level modification<br>
factor for the reference channel, the level modification<br>
factors for the other channels are calculated using the<br>
respective ICLD parameters.<br>
Thus, in order to perform BCC synthesis, the level<br>
modification factor for the reference channel is to be<br>
calculated. For this calculation, all ICLD parameters for a<br>
frequency band are necessary. Then, based on this level<br>
modification for the single channel, the level modification<br>
factors for the other channels, i.e., the channels, which<br>
are not the reference channel, can be calculated.<br>
This approach is disadvantageous in that, for a perfect<br>
reconstruction, one needs each and every inter-channel<br>
level difference. This requirement is even more<br>
problematic, when an error-prone transmission channel is<br>
present. Each error within a transmitted inter-channel<br>
level difference will result in an error in the<br>
reconstructed multi-channel signal, since each inter-<br>
channel level difference is required to calculate each one<br>
of the multi-channel output signal. Additionally, no<br>
reconstruction is possible, when an inter-channel level<br>
difference has been lost during transmission, although this<br>
inter-channel level difference was only necessary for e.g.<br>
the left surround channel or the right surround channel,<br>
which channels are not so important to multi-channel<br>
reconstruction, since most of the information is included<br>
in the front left channel, which is subsequently called the<br>
left channel, the front right channel, which is<br>
subsequently called the right channel, or the centre<br>
channel. This situation becomes even worse, when the inter-<br>
channel level difference of the low frequency enhancement<br>
channel has been lost during transmission. In this<br>
situation, no or only an erroneous multi-channel<br>
reconstruction is possible, although the low frequency<br>
enhancement channel is not so decisive for the listeners'<br><br>
listening comfort. Thus, errors in a single inter-channel<br>
level difference are propagated to errors within each of<br>
the reconstructed output channels.<br>
While such multi-channel parameterization schemes are based<br>
on the intention to fully reconstruct the energy<br>
distribution, the price one has to pay for this correct<br>
reconstruction of the energy distribution is an increased<br>
bit rate, since a lot of inter-channel level differences or<br>
balance parameters for the spatial energy distribution have<br>
to be transmitted. Although these energy distribution<br>
schemes naturally do not perform an exact reconstruction of<br>
time wave forms of the original channels, they nevertheless<br>
result in a sufficient output channel quality because of<br>
the exact energy distribution property.<br>
For low-bit rate applications, however, these schemes still<br>
require too many bits, which has resulted in the<br>
consequence that for such low-bit rate applications, one<br>
did not think of a multi-channel reconstruction but one was<br>
satisfied with having a mono or stereo reconstruction only.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
multi-channel processing scheme, which allows a multi-<br>
channel reconstruction even under low-bit rate constraints.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus for generating a<br>
parametric representation in accordance with claim 1, an<br>
apparatus for reconstructing a multi-channel signal in<br>
accordance with claim 19, a method of generating a<br>
parametric representation in accordance with claim 28, a<br>
method of reconstructing a multi-channel signal in<br>
accordance with claim 29, a computer program in accordance<br>
with claim 30 or a parameter representation in accordance<br>
with claim 31.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that the main<br>
subjective auditory feeling of a listener of a multi-<br>
channel representation is generated by her or him<br>
recognizing the specific region/direction in a replay<br>
setup, in which the sound energy is concentrated. This<br>
region/direction can be located by a listener within<br>
certain accuracy. Not so important for the subjective<br>
listening impression is, however, the distribution of the<br>
sound energy between the respective speakers. When, for<br>
example, the concentration of the sound energy of all<br>
channels is within a sector of the replay setup, which<br>
extends between a reference point, which preferably is the<br>
center point of a replay setup, and two speakers, it is not<br>
so important for the listener's subjective quality<br>
impression, how the energy is distributed between the other<br>
speakers. When comparing a reconstructed multi-channel<br>
signal to an original multi-channel signal, it has been<br>
found out that the user is satisfied to a high degree, when<br>
the concentration of the sound energy within a certain<br>
region in the reconstructed sound field is similar to the<br>
corresponding situation of the original multi-channel<br>
signal.<br>
In view of this, it becomes clear that prior art parametric<br>
multi-channel schemes process and transmit an amount of<br>
redundant information, since such schemes have concentrated<br>
on encoding and transmitting the complete distribution<br>
between all channels in a replay setup.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, only the region<br>
including the local sound energy maximum is encoded, while<br>
the distribution of energy between other channels, which do<br>
not have main contributions to this local maximum sound<br>
energy, is neglected and, therefore, does not involve any<br>
bits for transmitting this information. Thus, the present<br>
invention encodes and transmits even less information from<br>
a sound field compared to prior art full-energy<br><br>
distribution systems and, therefore, also allows a multi-<br>
channel reconstruction even under very restrictive bit rate<br>
conditions.<br>
Stated in other words, the present invention determines the<br>
direction of the local sound maximum region with respect to<br>
a reference position and, based on this information, a sub-<br>
group of speakers such as the speakers defining a sector,<br>
in which the sound maximum is positioned or two speakers<br>
surrounding the sound-maximum, is selected on the decoder-<br>
side. This selection only uses transmitted direction<br>
information for the maximum energy region. On the decoder-<br>
side, the energy of the signals in the selected channels is<br>
set such that the local sound maximum region is<br>
reconstructed. The energies in the selected channels can -<br>
and will necessarily be - different from the energies of<br>
the corresponding channels in the original multi-channel<br>
signal. Nevertheless, the direction of the local sound<br>
maximum is identical to the direction of the local maximum<br>
in the original signal or is at least quite similar. The<br>
signals for the remaining channels will be created<br>
synthetically as ambience signals. The ambience signals are<br>
also derived from the transmitted base channel (s), which<br>
typically will be a mono channel. For generating the<br>
ambience channels, however, the present invention does not<br>
necessarily need any transmitted information. Instead,<br>
decorrelated signals for the ambience channels are derived<br>
from the mono signals such as by using a reverberator or<br>
any other known device for generating decorrelated signal.<br>
For making sure that the combined energy of the selected<br>
channels and the remaining channels is similar to the mono<br>
signal or the original signal, a level control is<br>
performed, which scales all signals in the selected<br>
channels and the remaining channels such that the energy<br>
condition is fulfilled. This scaling of all channels,<br>
however, does not result in a moving of the energy maximum<br>
region, since this energy maximum region is determined by a<br><br>
transmitted direction information, which is used for<br>
selecting the channels and for adjusting the energy ratio<br>
between the energies in the selected channels.<br>
Subsequently, two preferred embodiments are summarized. The<br>
present invention relates to the problem of a parameterized<br>
multi-channel representation of audio signals. One<br>
preferred embodiment includes a method for encoding and<br>
decoding sound positioning within a multi-channel audio<br>
signal, comprising: down-mixing the multi-channel signal on<br>
the encoder side, given said multi-channel signal;<br>
selecting a channel pair within the multi-channel signal;<br>
at the encoder, calculating parameters for positioning a<br>
sound between said selected channels; encoding said<br>
positioning parameters and said channel pair selection; at<br>
the decoder side, recreating multi-channel audio according<br>
to said selection and positioning parameters decoded from<br>
bitstream data.<br>
A further embodiment includes a method for encoding and<br>
decoding sound positioning within a multi-channel audio<br>
signal, comprising: down-mixing the multi-channel signal on<br>
the encoder side, given said multi-channel signal;<br>
calculating an angle and a radius that represent said<br>
multi-channel signal; encoding said angle and said radius;<br>
at the decoder side, recreating multi-channel audio<br>
according to said angle and said radius decoded from the<br>
bitstream data.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The below-described embodiments are merely illustrative for<br>
the principles of the present invention on multi-channels<br>
representation of audio signals. It is understood that<br>
modifications and variations of the arrangements and the<br>
details described herein will be apparent to others skilled<br>
in the art. It is the intent, therefore, to be limited only<br>
by the scope of the impending patent claims and not by the<br>
specific details presented by way of description and<br>
explanation of the embodiments herein.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention, hereinafter<br>
referred to as 'route &amp; pan', uses the following parameters<br>
to position an audio source across the speaker array:<br>
a panorama parameter for continuously positioning the<br>
sound between two (or three) loudspeakers; and<br>
routing information defining the speaker pair (or<br>
triple) the panorama parameter applies to.<br>
Figs. 1a through 1c illustrate this scheme, using a typical<br>
five loudspeaker setup comprising of a left front channel<br>
speaker (L), 102, 111 and 122, a centre channel speaker<br>
(C) , 103, 112 and 123, a right front channel speaker (R) ,<br>
104, 113 and 124, a left surround channel speaker (Ls) 101,<br>
110 and 121 and a right surround channel speaker (Rs) 105,<br>
114 and 125. The original 5 channel input signal is<br>
downmixed at an encoder to a mono signal which is coded,<br>
transmitted or stored.<br><br>
In the example in Fig. la, the encoder has determined that<br>
the sound energy basically is concentrated to 104 (R) and<br>
105 (Rs). Thus, the channels 104 and 105 have been selected<br>
as the speaker pair which the panorama parameter is applied<br>
to. The panorama parameter is estimated, coded and<br>
transmitted in accordance with prior art methods. This is<br>
illustrated by the arrow 107, which defines the limits for<br>
positioning a virtual sound source at this particular<br>
speaker pair selection. Similarly, an optional stereo width<br>
parameter can be derived and signalled for said channel<br>
pair in accordance with prior art methods. The channel<br>
selection can be signalled by means of a three bit 'route'<br>
signal, as defined by the table in Fig. 2. PSP denotes<br>
Parametric Stereo Pair, and the second column of the table<br>
lists which speakers to apply the panning and optional<br>
stereo width information at a given value of the route<br>
signal. DAP denotes Derived Ambience Pair, i.e. a stereo<br>
signal which is obtained by processing the PSP with<br>
arbitrary prior art methods for generating ambience<br>
signals. The third column of the table defines which<br>
speaker pair to feed with the DAP signal, the relative<br>
level of which is either predefined or optionally signalled<br>
from the encoder by means of an ambience level signal.<br>
Route values of 0 through 3 correspond to turning around a<br>
4 channel system (disregarding the centre channel speaker<br>
(C) for now) , comprising of a PSP for the "front" channels<br>
and DAP for the "back" channels in 90 degree steps<br>
(approximately, depending on the speaker array geometry).<br>
Thus Fig la corresponds to route value 1, and 106 defines<br>
the spatial coverage of the DAP signal. Clearly this method<br>
allows for moving sound objects 360 degrees around the room<br>
by selecting speaker pairs corresponding to route values 0<br>
through 3.<br>
Fig. 1d is a block diagram of one possible embodiment of a<br>
route and pan decoder comprising of a parametric stereo<br>
decoder according to prior art 130, an ambience signal<br><br>
generator 131, and a channel selector 132. The parametric<br>
stereo decoder takes a base channel (downmix) signal 133, a<br>
panorama signal 134, and a stereo width signal 135<br>
(corresponding to a parametric stereo bitstream according<br>
to prior art methods, 136) as input, and generates a PSP<br>
signal 137, which is fed to the channel selector. In<br>
addition, the PSP is fed to the ambience generator, which<br>
generates a DAP signal 138 in accordance with prior art<br>
methods, e.g. by means of delays and reverberators, which<br>
also is fed to the channel selector. The channel selector<br>
takes a route signal 139, (which together the panorama<br>
signal forms the direction parameter information 140) and<br>
connects the PSP and DAP signals to the corresponding<br>
output channels 141, in accordance with the table in Fig.<br>
2. The straight lines within the channel selector<br>
correspond to the case illustrated by Fig. la and Fig. 2,<br>
route = 1. Optionally, the ambience generator takes an<br>
ambience level signal as input, 142 to control the level<br>
the ambience generator output. In an alternative embodiment<br>
the ambience generator 131 would also utilize the signals<br>
134 and 135 for the DAP generation.<br>
Fig. lb illustrates another possibility of this scheme:<br>
Here the non-adjacent 111 (L) and 114 (Rs) are selected as<br>
the speaker pair. Hence, a virtual sound source can be<br>
moved diagonally by means of the pan parameter, as<br>
illustrated by the arrow 116. 115 outlines the localization<br>
of the corresponding DAP signal. Route values 4 and 5 in<br>
Fig. 2 correspond to this diagonal panning.<br>
In a variation of the above embodiment, when selecting two<br>
non-adjacent speakers, the speaker(s) between the selected<br>
speaker-pair is fed according to a three-way panning<br>
scheme, as illustrated by Fig. 3b. For reference Fig. 3a<br>
shows a conventional stereo panning scheme, and Fig. 3b a<br>
three-way panning scheme, both according to prior art<br>
methods. Fig. lc gives an example of application of a<br>
three-way panning scheme: E.g. if 102 (L) and 104 (R) form<br><br>
the speaker pair, the signal is routed to 103 (C) for mid-<br>
position pan values. This case is further illustrated by<br>
the dashed lines in the channel selector 132 of Fig. 1d,<br>
where the center channel output 143 of the generalized<br>
parametric stereo decoder is active due to the 3 way<br>
panning employed. In order to stabilize the sound stage,<br>
pan-curves with large overlap may be used: The outer<br>
speaker then contribute to the reproduction also at mid-<br>
position panning, wherein the signal from the middle<br>
speaker is attenuated correspondingly, such that a constant<br>
power is achieved across the entire panning range. Further<br>
examples of routing where three-way panning can be used are<br>
C-R-Rs and L-[Ls &amp; R]-Rs (i.e. mid-position panning yields<br>
signals from both Ls and R). Whether the three-way-panning<br>
should be applied or not can, of course, be signalled by<br>
the route signal. Alternatively, a predefined behaviour<br>
could be that the three-way-panning should be applied if<br>
two non-adjacent speakers having at least one speaker in<br>
between are indexed with the route signal.<br>
The above scheme copes well with single sound sources, and<br>
is useful for special sound effects, e.g. a helicopter<br>
flying around. Multiple sources at different positions but<br>
separated in frequency are also covered, if individual<br>
routing and panning for different frequency bands is<br>
employed.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention, hereinafter<br>
referred to as 'angle &amp; radius', is a generalization of the<br>
above scheme wherein the following parameters are used for<br>
positioning:<br>
an angle parameter for continuously positioning a<br>
sound across the entire speaker array (360 degree<br>
range); and<br>
a radius parameter for controlling the spread of sound<br>
across the speaker array (0-1 range).<br><br>
In other words, multiple speaker music material can be<br>
represented by polar-coordinates, an angle a and a radius<br>
r, where a can cover the full 360 degrees and hence the<br>
sound can be mapped to any direction. The radius r enables<br>
that sound can be mapped to several speakers and not only<br>
to two adjacent speakers. It can be viewed as a<br>
generalisation of the above three-way panning, where the<br>
amount of overlap is determined by the radius parameter<br>
(e.g. a large value of r corresponds to a small overlap).<br>
To exemplify the embodiment above, a radius in the range of<br>
[r] , which is defined from 0 to 1, is assumed. 0 means that<br>
all speakers have the same amount of energy, and 1 could be<br>
interpreted as that two channel panning should be applied<br>
between the two adjacent speakers that are closest to the<br>
direction defined by [α]. At the encoder, [α, r] can be<br>
extracted using e.g. the input speaker configuration and<br>
the energy in each speaker to calculate a sound centre<br>
point in analogy to the centre of mass. Generally, the<br>
sound centre point will be closer to a speaker emitting<br>
more sound energy than a different speaker in a replay<br>
setup. For calculating the sound centre point, one can use<br>
the spatial positions of the speakers in a replay setup,<br>
optionally a direction characteristic of the speakers, and<br>
the sound energy emitted by each speaker, which directly<br>
depends on the energy of the electrical signal for the<br>
respective channel.<br>
The sound centre point which is located within the multi<br>
channel speaker setup is then parameterized with an angle<br>
and a radius [α,r].<br>
At the decoder side multiple speaker panning rules are<br>
utilized for the currently used speaker configuration to<br>
give all [α,r] combinations a defined amount of sound in<br>
each speaker. Thus, the same sound source direction is<br><br>
generated at the decoder side as was present at the encoder<br>
side.<br>
Another advantage with the current invention is that the<br>
encoder and decoder channel configurations do not have to<br>
be identical, since the parameterization can be mapped to<br>
the speaker configuration currently available at the<br>
decoder in order to still achieve the correct sound<br>
localization.<br>
Fig. 4a, where 401 through 405 correspond to 101 through<br>
105 in Fig la, exemplifies a case where the sound 408 is<br>
located close to the right front speaker (R) -404. Since r<br>
407 is 1 and a 406 points between the right front speaker<br>
(R) 404 and the right surround speaker (RS) 405. The<br>
decoder will apply two channels panning between the right<br>
front speaker (R) 404 and the right surround speaker (RS).<br>
Fig. 4b, where 410 through 414 correspond to 101 through<br>
105 in Fig la, exemplifies a case where the sound image 417<br>
general direction is close to the left front speaker 411.<br>
The extracted or 415 will point towards the middle of the<br>
sound image and the extracted r 416 ensures that the<br>
decoder can recreate the sound image width using multi<br>
speaker panning to distribute the transmitted audio signal<br>
belonging to the extracted a 415 and r 416.<br>
The angle &amp; radius parameterisation can be combined with<br>
pre-defined rules where an ambience signal is generated and<br>
added to the opposite direction (of α ) . Alternatively a<br>
separate signalling of angle and radius for an ambience<br>
signal can be employed.<br>
In preferred embodiments, some additional signalling is<br>
used to adapt the inventive scheme to certain scenarios.<br>
The above two basic direction parameter schemes do not<br>
cover all scenarios well. Often, a "full soundstage" is<br>
needed across L-C-R, and in addition a directed sound is<br><br>
desired from one back channel. There are several<br>
possibilities to extend the functionality to cope with this<br>
situation:<br>
1.	Send additional parameter-sets on an as-needed basis.<br>
E.g. a system defaults to a 1:1 relation between the<br>
downmix signal and the parameters, but occasionally a<br>
second parameter-set is sent which also operates on<br>
the downmix signal corresponding to a 1:2<br>
configuration. Clearly, arbitrary additional sources<br>
are obtainable in this fashion by means of<br>
superimposing the decoded parameters.<br>
2.	Use decoder side rules (depending on routing and<br>
panning or angle and radius values) to override the<br>
default panning behaviour. One possible rule,<br>
assuming separate parameters for individual frequency<br>
bands, is "When only a few frequency bands are routed<br>
and panned substantially different than the others,<br>
interpolate panning of 'the others' for the 'few<br>
bands' and apply the signalled panning for 'the few<br>
ones' in addition to achieve the same effect as in<br>
example 1. A flag could be used to switch this<br>
behaviour on/off.<br>
Stated in other words, this example uses separate<br>
parameters for individual frequency bands, and is<br>
employing interpolation in the frequency direction<br>
according to the following: If only a few frequency<br>
bands are routed and panned substantially different<br>
(out-layers) than the others (main group), the<br>
parameters of the out-layers are to be interpreted as<br>
additional parameter sets according to the above<br>
(although not transmitted). For said few frequency<br>
bands, the parameters of the main group are<br>
interpolated in the frequency direction. Finally the<br>
two sets of parameters now available for the few<br>
bands are superimposed. This allows placing an<br><br>
additional source at a substantially different<br>
direction than that of the main group, without<br>
sending additional parameters, while avoiding a<br>
spectral hole in the main direction for the few out-<br>
layer bands. A flag could be used to switch this<br>
behaviour on/off.<br>
3. Signal some special preset mappings, e.g.<br>
a)	Route signal to all speakers;<br>
b)	Route signal to arbitrary single speaker; and<br>
c)	Route signal to selected subsets of speakers (&gt;2).<br>
The above three extended cases apply to the route &amp; pan<br>
scheme as well as to the angle &amp; radius scheme. Preset<br>
mappings are particularly useful for the route &amp; pan case<br>
as evident from the below example, where also ambience<br>
signals are discussed.<br>
Fig. 2 finally gives an example of possible special preset<br>
mappings: The last two route values, 6 and 7, correspond to<br>
special cases where no panning info is transmitted, and the<br>
downmix signal is mapped according to the 4th column, and<br>
ambience signals are generated and mapped according to the<br>
last column. The case defined by the last row creates an<br>
"in the middle of a diffuse sound field" impression. A<br>
bitstream for a system according to this example could in<br>
addition include a flag for enabling three-way panning<br>
whenever speaker pairs in the PSP column are not adjacent<br>
within the speaker array.<br>
A further example of the present invention is a system<br>
using one angle and radius parameter-set for the direct<br>
sound, and a second angle and radius parameter-set for the<br>
ambience sound. In this example a mono signal is<br>
transmitted and used both for the angle and radius<br>
parameter-set panning the direct sound and the creation of<br>
a decorrelated ambience signal which is then applied using<br><br>
the angle and radius parameter-set for the ambience.<br>
Schematically a bitstream example could look like:<br><angle_direct><br><angle_ambience><br><m><br>
A further example of the present invention utilizes both<br>
route &amp; pan and angle &amp; radius parameterisations and two<br>
mono signals. In this example the angle &amp; radius parameters<br>
describe the panning of the direct sound from the mono<br>
signal Ml. Furthermore route &amp; pan is used to describe how<br>
the ambience signal generated from M2 is applied. Hence the<br>
transmitted route value describes, in which channels the<br>
ambience signal should be applied and as an example the<br>
ambience representation of Fig. 2 could be utilized. The<br>
corresponding bitstream example could look like:<br><angle_direct><br><route><br><ml_direct><br><m2_ambience><br>
The parameterisation schemes for spatial positioning of<br>
sounds in a multichannel speaker setup according to the<br>
present invention are building blocks that can be applied<br>
in a multitude of ways:<br>
i) Frequency range:<br>
Global (for all frequency bands) routing; or<br>
Per-band routing.<br>
ii) Number of parameter sets:<br>
Static (fixed over time); or<br>
Dynamic (additional sets sent on as-needed basis).<br>
iii) Signal application, i.e. coding of:<br>
Direct (dry) sound; or<br><br>
Ambient (wet) sound.<br>
iv) Relations between the number of downmix signals and<br>
parameter sets, e.g.:<br>
1:1 (mono downmix and single parameter set);<br>
2:1 (stereo downmix and single parameter set); or<br>
1:2 (mono downmix and two parameter sets) . The downmix<br>
signal M is assumed to be the sum of all original<br>
input channels. It can be an adaptively weighted and<br>
adaptively phase adjusted sum(s) of all inputs.<br>
v) Super position of downmix signals and parameter sets,<br>
e.g.<br>
1:1 + 1:1 (two different mono downmixes and<br>
corresponding single parameter sets)<br>
The latter is useful for adaptive downmix &amp; coding, e.g.<br>
array (beamforming) algorithms, signal separation (encoding<br>
of primary max, secondary max,...) .<br>
For the sake of clarity, in the following, panning using a<br>
balance parameter between two channels (Fig. 3a) or between<br>
three channels (Fig. 3b) according to prior art is<br>
described. Generally, the balance parameter indicates the<br>
localization of a sound source between two different<br>
spatial positions of, for example two speakers in a replay<br>
setup. Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b indicate such a situation<br>
between the left and the right channel.<br>
Fig. 3a illustrates an example of how a panorama parameter<br>
relates to the energy distribution across the speaker pair.<br>
The x-axis is the panorama parameter, spanning the interval<br>
[-1,1], which corresponds to [extreme left, extreme right].<br>
The y-axis spans [0,1] where 0 corresponds to 0 output and<br>
1 to full relative output level. Curve 301 illustrates how<br>
much output is distributed to the left channel dependant on<br>
the panning parameter and 302 illustrates the corresponding<br>
output for the right channel. Hence a parameter value of -1<br><br>
yield that all input should be panned to the left speaker<br>
and zero to the right speaker, consequently vice versa is<br>
true for a panning value of 1.<br>
Fig. 3b indicates a three-way panning situation, which<br>
shows three possible curves 311, 312 and 313. Similarly as<br>
in Fig. 3a the x-axis cover [-1,1] and the y-axis spans<br>
[0,1]. As before curve 311 and 312 illustrates how much<br>
signal is distributed to left and right channels. Curve 312<br>
illustrates how much signal is distributed to the centre<br>
channel.<br>
Subsequently, the inventive concept will be discussed in<br>
connection with Figs. 5a to 6b. Fig. 5a illustrates an<br>
inventive apparatus for generating a . parametric<br>
representation of an original multi-channel signal having<br>
at least three original channels, the parametric<br>
representation including a direction parameter information<br>
to be used in addition to a base channel derived from the<br>
at least three original channels for reconstructing an<br>
output signal having at least two channels. Furthermore,<br>
the original channels are associated with sound sources<br>
positioned at different spatial positions in a replay setup<br>
as has been discussed in connection with Figs, la, lb, lc,<br>
4a, 4b. Each replay setup has a reference position 10 (Fig.<br>
la), which is preferably a center of a circle, along which<br>
the speakers 101 to 105 are positioned.<br>
The inventive apparatus includes a direction information<br>
calculator 50 for determining the direction parameter<br>
information. In accordance with the present invention, the<br>
direction parameter information indicate a direction from<br>
the reference position 10 to a region in a replay setup, in<br>
which a combined sound energy of the at least three<br>
original channels is concentrated. This region is indicated<br>
as a sector 12 in Fig. la, which is defined by lines<br>
extending from the reference position 10 to the right<br>
channel 104 and extending from the reference position 10 to<br><br>
the right surround channel 105. It is assumed that, in the<br>
present audio scene, there is, for example, a dominant<br>
sound source positioned in the region 12. Additionally, it<br>
is assumed that the local sound energy maximum between all<br>
five channels or at least the right and the right surround<br>
channels is at a position 14 . Additionally, a direction<br>
from the reference position to the region and, in<br>
particular, to the local energy maximum 14 is indicated by<br>
a direction arrow 16. The direction arrow is defined by the<br>
reference position 10 and the local energy maximum position<br>
14.<br>
In accordance with the first embodiment, which has, as the<br>
direction parameter information, the route information<br>
indicating a channel pair, and the balance or pan parameter<br>
indicating an energy distribution between the two selected<br>
channels, the reconstructed energy maximum can only be<br>
shifted along the double-headed arrow 18. The degree or<br>
position, where the local energy maximum in a multi-channel<br>
reconstruction can be placed along the arrow 18 is<br>
determined by the pan or balance parameter. When, for<br>
example, the local sound maximum is at 14 in Fig. la, this<br>
point can not exactly be encoded in this embodiment. For<br>
encoding the local energy maximum direction, however, a<br>
balance parameter indicating this direction would be a<br>
parameter, which results in a reconstructed local energy<br>
maximum lying on the crossing point between arrow 18 and<br>
arrow 16, which is indicated as "balance (pan)" in Fig. la.<br>
One possible embodiment of a route &amp; pan scheme encoder is<br>
to first calculate the local energy maximum, 14 in Fig. la,<br>
and the corresponging angle and radius. Using the angle, a<br>
channel pair (or triple) selected, which yields a route<br>
parameter value. Finally the angle is converted to a pan<br>
value for the selceted channel pair, and, optionally the<br>
radius is used to calculate an ambience level parameter.<br><br>
The Fig. la embodiment is advantageous, however, in that it<br>
is not necessary to exactly calculate the local energy<br>
maximum 14 for determining the channel pair and the<br>
balance. Instead, necessary direction information is simply<br>
derived from the channels by checking the energies in the<br>
original channels and by selecting the two channels (or<br>
channel triple e.g. L-C-R) having the highest energies.<br>
This identified channel pair (triple) defines a sector 12<br>
in the replay setup, in which the local energy maximum 14<br>
will be positioned. Thus, the channel pair selection is<br>
already a determination of a coarse direction. The "fine<br>
tuning" of the direction will be performed by the balance<br>
parameter. For a rough approximation, the present invention<br>
determines the balance parameter simply by calculating the<br>
quotient between the energies in the selected channels.<br>
Thus, because of the other channels C, L, Ls, which have<br>
not been selected, the direction 16 encoded by channel pair<br>
selection and balance parameter may deviate a little bit<br>
from the actual local energy maximum direction because of<br>
the contributions of the other speakers. For the sake of<br>
bit rate reduction, however, such deviations are accepted<br>
in the Fig. la route and pan embodiment.<br>
The Fig. 5a apparatus additionally includes a data output<br>
generator 52 for generating the parametric representation<br>
so that the parametric representation includes the<br>
direction parameter information. It is to be noted that, in<br>
a preferred embodiment, the direction parameter information<br>
indicating a (at least) rough direction from the reference<br>
position to the local energy maximum is the only inter-<br>
channel level difference information transmitted from the<br>
encoder to the decoder. In contrast to the prior art BCC<br>
scheme, the present invention, therefore, only has to<br>
transmit a single balance parameter rather than 4 or 5<br>
balance parameters for a five channel system.<br>
Preferably, the direction information calculator 50 is<br>
operative to determine the direction information such that<br><br>
the region, in which the combined energy is concentrated,<br>
includes at least 50 % of the total sound energy in the<br>
replay setup.<br>
Furthermore or alternatively, it is preferred that the<br>
direction information calculator 50 is operative to<br>
determine the direction information such that the region<br>
only includes positions in the replay setup having a local<br>
energy value which is greater than 75 % of a maximum local<br>
energy value, which is also positioned within the region.<br>
Fig. 5b indicates an inventive decoder setup. In<br>
particular, Fig. 5b shows an apparatus for reconstructing a<br>
multi-channel signal using at least one base channel and a<br>
parametric representation including direction parameter<br>
information indicating a direction from a position in the<br>
replay setup to the region in the replay setup, in which a<br>
combined sound energy of at least three original channels<br>
is concentrated, from which the at least one base channel<br>
has been derived. In particular, the inventive device<br>
includes an input interface 53 for receiving the at least<br>
one base channel and the parametric representation, which<br>
can come in a single data stream or which can come in<br>
different data streams. The input interface outputs the<br>
base channel and the direction parameter information into<br>
an output channel generator 54.<br>
The output channel generator is operative for generating a<br>
number of output channels to be positioned in the replay<br>
setup with respect to the reference position, the number of<br>
output channels being higher than a number of base<br>
channels. Inventively, the output channel generator is<br>
operative to generate the output channels in response to<br>
the direction parameter information so that a direction<br>
from the reference point to a region, in which the combined<br>
energy of the reconstructed output channels is<br>
concentrated, is similar to the direction indicated by the<br>
direction parameter information. To this end, the output<br><br>
channel generator 54 needs information on the reference<br>
position, which can be transmitted or, preferably,<br>
predetermined. Additionally, the output channel generator<br>
54 requires information on different spatial positions of<br>
speakers in the replay setup which are to be connected to<br>
the output channel generator at the reconstructed output<br>
channels output 55. This information is also preferably<br>
predetermined and can be signaled easily by certain<br>
information bits indicating a normal five plus one setup or<br>
a modified setup or a channel configuration having seven or<br>
more or less channels.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the inventive output channel<br>
generator 54 in Fig. 5b is indicated in Fig. 5c. The<br>
direction information is input into a channel selector. The<br>
channel selector 56 selects the output channels, whose<br>
energy is to be determined by the direction information. In<br>
the Fig. 1 embodiment, the selected channels are the<br>
channels of the channel pair, which are signaled more or<br>
less explicitly in the direction information route bits<br>
(first column of Fig. 2).<br>
In the Fig. 4 embodiment, the channels to be selected by<br>
the channel selector 56 are signaled implicitly and are not<br>
necessarily related to the replay setup connected to the<br>
reconstructor. Instead, the angle α is directed to a<br>
certain direction in the replay setup. Irrespective of the<br>
fact, whether the replay speaker setup is identical to the<br>
original channel setup, the channel selector 56 can<br>
determine the speakers defining the sector, in which the<br>
angle a is positioned. This can be done by geometrical<br>
calculations or preferably by a look-up table.<br>
Additionally, the angle is also indicative of the energy<br>
distribution between the channels, defining the sector. The<br>
particular angle a further defines a panning or a balancing<br>
of the channel. When Fig. 4a is considered, the angle α<br>
crosses the circle at a point, which is indicated as,<br><br>
"sound energy center", which is more close to the right<br>
speaker 404 than to the right surround speaker 405. Thus, a<br>
decoder calculates a balance parameter between speaker 404<br>
and speaker 405 based on the sound energy center point and<br>
the distances of this point to the right speaker 404 and<br>
the right surround speaker 405. Then, the channel selector<br>
56 signals its channel selection to the up-mixer. The<br>
channel selector will select at least two channels from all<br>
output channels and, in the Fig. 4b embodiment, even more<br>
than two speakers. Nevertheless, the channel selector will<br>
never select all speakers except a case, in which a special<br>
all speaker information is signaled. Then, an up-mixer 57<br>
performs an up-mix of the mono signal received via the base<br>
channel line 58 based on a balance parameter explicitly<br>
transmitted into the direction information or based on the<br>
balance value derived from the transmitted angle. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, also an inter-channel coherence<br>
parameter is transmitted and used by the up-mixer 57 to<br>
calculate the selected channels. The selected channels will<br>
output the direct or "dry sound", which is responsible for<br>
reconstructing the local sound maximum, wherein the<br>
position of this local sound maximum is encoded by the<br>
transmitted direction information.<br>
Preferably, the other channels, i.e., the remaining or non-<br>
selected channels are also provided with output signals.<br>
The output signals for the other channels are generated<br>
using an ambience, signal generator, which, for example,<br>
includes a reverberator for generating a decorrelated "wet"<br>
sound. Preferably, the decorrelated sound is also derived<br>
from the base channel (s) and is input into the remaining<br>
channels. Preferably, the inventive output channel<br>
generator 54 in Fig. 5b also includes a level controller<br>
60, which scales the up-mixed selected channels as well as<br>
the remaining channels such that the overall energy in the<br>
output channels is equal or in a certain relation to the<br>
energy in the transmitted base channel (s). Naturally, the<br>
level control can perform a global energy scaling for all<br><br>
channels, but will not substantially alter the sound energy<br>
concentration as encoded and transmitted by the direction<br>
parameter information.<br>
In a low-bit rate embodiment, the present invention does<br>
not require any transmitted information for generating the<br>
remaining ambience channels, as has been discussed above.<br>
Instead, the signal for the ambience channels is derived<br>
from the transmitted mono signal in accordance with a<br>
predefined decorrelation rule and is forwarded to the<br>
remaining channels. The level difference between the level<br>
of the ambience channels and the level of the selected<br>
channels is predefined in this low-bit rate embodiment.<br>
For more advanced devices, which provide a better output<br>
quality, but which also require an increased bit rate, an<br>
ambience sound energy direction can also be calculated on<br>
the encoder side and transmitted. Additionally, a second<br>
down-mix channel can be generated, which is the "master<br>
channel" for the ambience sound. Preferably, this ambience<br>
master channel is generated on the encoder side by<br>
separating ambience sound in the original multi-channel<br>
signal from non-ambience sound.<br>
Fig. 6a indicates a flow chart for the route and pan<br>
embodiment. In a step 61, the channel pair with the highest<br>
energies is selected. Then, a balance parameter between the<br>
pair is calculated (62). Then, the channel pair and the<br>
balance parameter are transmitted to a decoder as the<br>
direction parameter information (36) . On the decoder-side,<br>
the transmitted direction parameter information is used for<br>
determining the channel pair and the balance between the<br>
channels (64). Based on the channel pair and the balance<br>
value, the signals for the direct channels are generated<br>
using, for example, a normal mono/stereo-up-mixer (PSP)<br>
(65). Additionally, decorrelated ambiences signals for<br>
remaining channels are created using one or more<br>
decorrelated ambience signals (DAP) (66).<br><br>
The angle and radius embodiment is illustrated as a flow<br>
diagram in Fig. 6b. In a step 71, a center of the sound<br>
energy in a (virtual) replay setup is calculated. Based on<br>
the center of a sound and a reference position, an angle<br>
and a distance of a vector from the reference position to<br>
the energy center are determined (72).<br>
Then, the angle and distance are transmitted as the<br>
direction parameter information (angle) and a spreading<br>
measure (distance) as indicated in step 73. The spreading<br>
measure indicates how many speakers are active for<br>
generating the direct signal. Stated in other words, the<br>
spreading measure indicates a place of a region, in which<br>
the energy is concentrated, which is not positioned on a<br>
connecting line between two speakers (such a position is<br>
fully defined by a balance parameter between these<br>
speakers) but which is not positioned on such a connecting<br>
line. For reconstructing such a position, more than two<br>
speakers are required.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the spreading parameter can also<br>
be used as a kind of a coherence parameter to synthetically<br>
increase the width of the sound compared to a case, in<br>
which all direct speakers are emitting fully correlated<br>
signals. In this case, the length of the vector can also be<br>
used to control a reverberator or any other device<br>
generating a de-correlated signal to be added to a signal<br>
for a "direct" channel.<br>
On the decoder-side, a sub-group of channels in the replay<br>
setup is determined using the angle, the distance, the<br>
reference position and the replay channel setup as<br>
indicated at step 74 in Fig. 6b. In step 75, the signals<br>
for the sub-group are generated using a one to n up-mix<br>
controlled by the angle, the radius, and, therefore, by the<br>
number of channels included in a sub-group. When the number<br>
of channels in the sub-group is small and, for example,<br><br>
equal to two, which is the case, when the radius has a<br>
large value, a simple up-mix using a balance parameter<br>
indicated by the angle of the vector can be used as in the<br>
Fig. 6a embodiment. When, however, the radius decreases<br>
and, therefore, the number of channels within the sub-group<br>
increases, it is possible to use a look-up table on the<br>
decoder-side which has, as an input, angle and radius, and<br>
which has, as an output, an identification for each channel<br>
in a sub-group associated with the certain vector and a<br>
level parameter, which is, preferably, a percentage<br>
parameter which is applied to the mono signal energy to<br>
determine the signal energy in each of the output channels<br>
within the selected sub-group. As stated in step 76 of Fig.<br>
6b, decorrelated ambience signals are generated and<br>
forwarded to the non-selected speakers.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be<br>
performed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disk or a CD having electronically readable control signals<br>
stored thereon, which cooperate with a programmable<br>
computer system such that the inventive methods are<br>
performed. Generally, the present invention is, therefore,<br>
a computer program product with a program code stored on a<br>
machine readable carrier, the program code being operative<br>
for performing the inventive methods when the computer<br>
program product runs on a computer. In other words, the<br>
inventive methods are, therefore, a computer program having<br>
a program code for performing at least one of the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program runs on a computer.<br><br>
