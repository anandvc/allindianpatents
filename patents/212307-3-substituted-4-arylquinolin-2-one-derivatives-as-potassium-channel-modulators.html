BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of P O Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br><br>

The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
This     invention     relates     to     "3-substituted-4-     arylquinolin-2-one compounds as potassium channel modulators".<br>
FIELD  OF THE  INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel 3-substituted-4-arylquinolin-2-one derivatives which are modulators of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and, therefore, useful in the protection of neuronal cells and diseases arising from dysfunction of cellular membrane polarization and conductance. The present invention also provides a method of treatment with the novel substituted quinolin-2-one derivatives and to pharmaceutical 
BACKGROUND  OF THE  INVENTION<br>
Potassium channels play a key role in regulation of cell membrane potential and modulation of cell excitability. Potassium channels are largely regulated by voltage, cell metabolism, calcium and receptor mediated processes. [Cook, N. S., Trends in Pharmacol. Sciences (1988), 9_, 21; and Quast, U., et al.. Trends in Pharmacol. Sciences (1989), 10, 431].Calcium-ativated potasssium are a diverse group of ion channels that share a dependence on intracellular calcium ions for activity. Tne activity of KCa channels is<br>
regulated by intracellular [Ca2+], membrane potential and<br><br>
phosphorylation.  On the basis of their single-channel conductances in symmetrical K+ solutions, KCa channels are divided into three subclasses: large conductance (BK) &gt; 150 pS; intermediate conductance 50-150 pS; small conductances 50 pS. Large-5     conductance calcium-activated potassium (Maxi-K or BK) channels are present in many excitable cells including neurons, cardiac cells and various types of smooth muscle cells. [Singer, J. et al.. Pflugers Archiv. (1987) 408 , 98; Baro. I., et al., Pflugers Archiv. (1989) 4J4 (Suppl. 1), S168; and Ahmed, F. et al.. Br. J. Pharmacol. (1984) S3, 227].<br>
10<br>
Potassium ions play a dominant role in controlling the resting membrane potential in most excitable cells and maintain the transmembrane voltage near the K+ equilibrium potential (Ek) of about -90 mV. It has been shown that opening of potassium channels shift the<br>
15     cell membrane potential towards the equilibrium potassium membrane potential (Ek, resulting in hyperpolarization of the cell. [Cook, N. S., Trends in Pharmacol. Sciences (1988), 9_, 21]. Hyperpolarized cells show a reduced response to potentially damaging depolarizing stimuli. BK channels which are regulated by both voltage and intracellular Ca2+<br>
20    act to limit depolarization and calcium entry and may be particularly effective in blocking damaging stimuli. Therefore cell hyperpolarization via opening of BK channels may result in protection of neuronal cells.<br>
A range of synthetic and naturally occurring compounds with BK 25     opening activity have been reported. The avena pyrone extracted from avena sativa-common oats has been identified as a BK channel opener using lipid bi-layer technique [International Patent application WO 93/08800, published May 13, 1993], 6-Bromo-8-(methylamino) imidazop ,2-a]pyrazine-2-carbonitrile (SCA-40) has been described as a 30     BK channel opener with very limited electrophysiological experiments [Laurent, F. et at Br. J. Pharmacol. (1993) 108, 622-626]. The flavanoid,<br><br><br><br>
Phloretin has been found to increase the open probability of Ca2+-activated potassium channels in myelinated nerve fibers of Xenopus laevis using outside-out patches [Koh, D-S., et al.. Neuroscience Lett (1994)155, 167-170]. 5<br>
In European patent application EP-477,819 published January 4, 1992 and corresponding U.S. Patent No. 5,200,422, issued April 6, 1993 to Olesen, et al.. a number of benzimidazole derivatives were disclosed as openers of BK channels by using single-channel and 10     whole-cell patch-clamp experiments in aortic smooth muscle cells.<br>
Further work was reported by Olesen, aLaJ., in European J. Pharmacol.. 251,53-59(1994).<br>
A number of substituted oxindoles have been disclosed as 15     openers of BK channels by P. Hewawasam, et al.. in U.S. Patent No. 5,565,483, issued October 15, 1996.<br>
Sit, et al.. in International Patent Application WO 98/23273, published June 4, 1998, and corresponding U.S. Patent No. 5,892,045,<br>
20     issued April 6,1999, disclosed a series of 4-aryl-3-hydroxyquinolin-2-one derivatives , while Hewawasam, et al.. in International Patent Application WO 99/09983, published March 4, 1999, disclosed a series of 4-aryl-3-aminoquinolini-2-one derivatives which are openers of BK channels and useful in the treatment of disorders sensitive to potassium channel<br>
25     opening activity.<br>
E. S. Hamanaka in U.S. Patent No. 5,565,472, issued October 15, 1996, discloses a number of 4-aryl-3-(heteroarylureido)-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-quinoline derivatives which are inhibitors of acyl coenzyme A; 30    cholesterol acyltransferase and are useful as hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerosis agents.<br><br><br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide novel compounds that will modulate potassium channels, in particular, large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels which will be useful in diseases arising from dysfunction of cellular membrane 5     polarization and conductance.<br>

The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by various procedures such as those illustrated herein in the examples and in the Reaction Schemes described in the specific embodiments and variations thereof which would be evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
The following Reaction Schemes 1-11 illustrate representative general procedures for the preparation of intermediates and methods for the preparation of products according to this invention. It should also be evident to those skilled in the art that appropriate substitution of both the materials and methods disclosed herein will produce the examples illustrated below and those encompassed by the scope of this invention.<br><br>

The preparation of 2(1 H)-quinoiinones of Formulae 4 and 5 is illustrated in Reaction Scheme 1. Acylation of the compound of Formula 1 with an acid chloride as shown in the Reaction Scheme provided the amide of Formula 2 wherein Ra is hydrogen or C^ alkyl which may be cyclized and dehydrated to the quinolinone of Formula 3 by treatment with a base such as potassium tert-butoxide in an inert organic solvent. Exposure of the ester of Formula 3 to a reducing agent such as diisobutyl aluminum hydride affords the primary alcohol of Formula 4 which can then be advantageously oxidized with an oxidant such as manganese dioxide to yield the desired aldehyde of Formula 5.<br><br><br><br>

As illustrated in Reaction Scheme 2, the homologation of the aldehyde of Fonnula 5 can readily be accomplished with a phosphonate reagent to produce the unsaturated ester of Formula 6 as a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-isomers which then be separated using column chromatography. Reduction of the ester of Formula 6 may be carried out with a reducing agent such as diisobutyl aluminum hydride to afford the corresponding allylic alcohol of Fonnula 7. Alternatively, when it is desired to prepare the compound of Formula 9, the ester of Formula 6 is selectively reduced under hydrogenation conditions to reduce the double bond and provide the saturated ester of Formula 8. Treatment of the ester of Formula 8, under conditions similar to the reduction of the ester of Fonnula 6 will afford the corresponding alcohol of Formula 9.<br><br><br>

In Reaction Scheme 3, the butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) and methyl groups can be removed simultaneously by treatment of the compound of<br>
      Formula 1a with boron tribromide (BBr3) to give the aniline of Formula 10. Acylation of the aniline of Formula 10 afforded the corresponding amide of Formula 11, which is readily cyclized and dehydrated under basic conditions with potassium tert-butoxide to provide the lactone of Formula 12. Partial reduction of the lactone with diisobutyl aluminum<br>
        hydride in THF produced the intermediate lactol of Formula 13.       Alternatively, it has been found that by changing solvents from THF to methylene chloride, the lactone of Formula 12 can be reduced with diisobutyl aluminum hydride to provide the desired alcohol of Formula 14.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

When it is desired to prepare the compound of Formulae 17 and 20, the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 may be treated as shown in Reaction Scheme 4 with a phospnonate reagent to afford the unsaturated ester of Formula 15 and then, if desired, be saponified to produce the unsaturated acid of Formula 16. Reduction of the ester of Formula 15 with aluminum hydride affords the corresponding unsaturated alcohol of Formula 17. Alternatively, the hydrogenation of        the double bond of the compound of Formula 15 yields the ester of Formula 18, which may be either saponified to produce the acid of Formula 19, or reduced with aluminum hydride to yield the desired alcohol of Formula 20.<br><br>

Reaction Scheme 5 illustrates the homologation of the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 with a fluorophosphonate, as described in step (a) in the Reaction Scheme, to afford the unsaturated a-fluoroester ester of Formula 21 as a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-isomers.<br>
The crude mixture of esters of Formula 21 may be reduced with aluminum hydride, and the resulting mixture of alcohols are advantageously separated by column chromatography to afford the (E)-olefin of Formula 23 and the (Z)-olefin of Formula 25. In a similar manner, the aldehyde of Formula 5 which contains a methyl ether can be converted to the corresponding desired olefins of Formulae 24 and 26.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The preparation of compounds of Formulae 31a and 31b is illustrated in Reaction Scheme 6. Acylation of the aniline of Formula 1<br>
       with an acid chloride provides the corresponding amide. The amide of Formula 27 may be Cyclized under basic conditions to give the<br>

dehydrated and deesterified under acidic conditions such as HBr/AcOH or pTsOH, to afford the quinolinone of Formula 29. If desired, removal of<br>
      the methyl ether can be accomplished with pyridine hydrochloride at elevated temperatures to give the corresponding phenol of Formula 30. Reduction of the acid of Formula 30 then provides the alcohol of Formula 31a as the phenol. Alternatively, if the methyl ether of the<br><br><br>
phenol is desired, direct reduction of the carboxylic acid of Formula 29 with borane provides the corresponding alcohol of Formula 31b.<br><br><br><br><br>

As shown in Reaction Scheme 8, homologation of the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 with a cyano phosphonate or phosphonoacetate reagent provides the corresponding unsaturated nitrile of Formula 36a or acetate of Formula 37a, respectively. Similarly, the methyl ether analogs of Formulae 36b and 37b can be synthesized starting with the aldehyde of Formula 5 and treatment with either a cyano phosophonate or phosphonoacetate reagent, respectively. The oxime of Formula 38a can be prepared from the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 by treating the lactol with hydroxyl amine.

Biological Activity<br>
Potassium (K+) channels are structurally and functionally diverse families of K+-selective channel proteins which are ubiquitous in cells, indicating their central importance in regulating a number of key cell functions [Rudy, B., Neuroscience. 25: 729-749 (1988)]. While widely distributed as a class, K* channels are differentially distributed as<br><br><br>
individual members of this class or as families. [Gehlert, D. R., et al.. Neuroscience. 52: 191-205 (1993)].  In general, activation of K+ channels in cells, and particularly in excitable cells such as neurons and muscle ceils, leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, or in the case of depolarized cells, to repolarization. In addition to acting as an endogenous membrane voltage clamp, K+ channels can respond to important cellular events such as changes in the intracellular concentration of ATP or the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca2+). The central role of K+ channels in regulating numerous cell functions makes them particularly important targets for therapeutic development. [Cook, N. S., Potassium channels: Structure, classification, function and therapeutic potential. Ellis Horwood, Chinchester (1990)]. One class of K+ channels, the large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (Maxi-K or BK channels), is regulated by transmembrane voltage, intracellular Ca2+, and a variety of other factors such as the phosphorylation state of the channel protein. [Latorre, R., et al.. Ann. Rev. PysioL 51: 385-399 (1989)]. The large, single channel-conductance (generally &gt; 150 pS) and high degree of specificity for K+ of BK channels indicates that small numbers of channels could profoundly affect membrane conductance and cell excitability. Additionally, the increase in open probability with increasing intracellular Ca2+ indicates involvement of BK channels in the modulation of Ca2+-dependent phenomena such as secretion and muscular contraction. [Asano, M., et al.. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.. 267: 1277-1285 (1993)].<br>
Openers of BK channels exert their cellular effects by increasing the open probability of these channels [McKay, M. C, et al.. J* NeurophysioL 71: 1873-1882 (1994); and Olesen, S.-P., Exa.opin. Invest. Drugs. 3: 1181-1188 (1994)]. This increase in the opening of individual BK channels collectively results in the hyperpolarization of cell<br><br><br><br>
membranes, particularly in depolarized cells, produced by significant increases in whole-cell BK-mediated conductance.<br>
   The ability of compounds described in the present invention to open BK channels and increase whole-cell outward (K+) BK-mediated currents was assessed under voltage-clamp conditions by determining their ability to increase cloned mammalian (mSlo or hSIo) BK - mediated outward current heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes [Butler, A., et al., Science. 261: 221 -224 (1993); and Dworetzky, S. I., et al.. Mol. Brain Res.. 27: 189-193 (1994)]. The two BK constructs employed represent nearly structurally identical homologous proteins, and have proven to be pharmacologically identical in our tests. To isolate BK current from native (background, non-BK) current, the specific and potent BK channel-blocking toxin iberiotoxin (IBTX) [Galvez, A., et al.. J. Biol. Chem.. 265: 11083-11090 (1990)] was employed at a supramaximal concentration (50 nM). The relative contribution of BK channels current to total outward current was determined by subtraction of the current remaining in the presence of IBTX (non-BK current) from the current profiles obtained in all other experimental conditions (control, drug, and wash). It was determined that at the tested concentration the compounds profiled did not effect non-BK native currents in the oocytes. All compounds were tested in at least 5 oocytes and are reported at the single concentration of 20u,M; the effect of the selected compounds of<br>
Formula I on BK current was expressed as the percent of control IBTX-sensitive current and is listed in Table I. Recordings were accomplished using standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques [Stuhmer, W.,_et al  Methods in Enzvmology. Vol. 207: 319-339 (1992)]; voltage-clamp protocols consisted of.500-750 ms duration step depolarizations from a holding potential of -60 mV to +140 mV in 20 mV steps.

To determine the ability of these compounds to reduce cell loss resulting from neuronal ischemia, a standard rodent model of permanent focal ischemnia, involving occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model) was employed [Tamura, A., et al- Journal  of  Cerebral Blood BPW and Metabolism. Volume 1, 53-60, (1981)].<br><br><br>
Selected compounds have been evaluated in the focal stroke model involving permanent MCAO in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. This procedure results in a reliably large neocortical infarct volume that is measured by means of vital dye exclusion in serial slices through the brain 24 hours after MCAO. In the present test, compounds were administered using an intravenous route of administration at 2 hours after occlusion. For example, in this model, the compound of Example 21 reduced the cortical infarct volume by about 25% when administered (0.003 mg/kg) as a single bolus 2 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion as compared to vehicle-treated (2% OMSO, 98% propylene glycol) control.<br>
The in vivo model on erectile function is described fully in the scientific literature [Rehman, J., Chenven, E., Brink, P. Peterson, B., Wolcott, B.f Wen, Y.P., Melman, A., Christ, G.: Diminished neurogenic but not pharmacological erections in the 2- to 3-month experimentally diabetic F-344 rat. Am. J. Physiol. 272: H1960-H1971, (1997)]. Briefly, rats (250-600 g) were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital, the abdomen opened and the cavernous nerve identified. A pressure catheter was placed in the right corpus cavemosum (crus) to measure intracavemous pressure (ICP). A second catheter was introduced into the carotid artery to measure blood pressure. Test compound (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.v.) or vehicle (PEG 400) was given via a catheter placed into the jugular vein.<br>
Control intracavemous pressure responses were elicited by electrically stimulating the cavernous nerve via bipolar stimulating electrodes (20 Hz, 0.22 ms pulse width). Stimulus amplitude (0.2 - 20 mA) was adjusted to produce a submaximal intracavemous pressure response (typically 0.2 or 0.5 mA). A series of control intracavemous pressure responses were then obtained using a constant stimulus amplitude. Test compound or vehicle was then administered (200 \i\ i.v<br><br>
bolus) and the cavernous nerve was restimulated to evoke a cavernous pressure response at various times post-drug administration.   Animals were excluded from the study if the initial ICP responses to nerve stimulation were unstable ("spiky" responses) or if there were time-dependent variations in the magnitude of the control responses. Animals were also excluded if the control ICP/BP response fell outside the 0.3-0.6 range. A repeated measures ANOVA was used for the evaluation of statistical significance.<br>
The compound of Example 20 (0.1-1 mg/kg) produced an augmentation of the ICP/BP responses elicited by sub-maximal stimulation of the cavernous nerve. A significant increase in the ICP/BP ratio was observed at doses from 0.1-1.0 mg/kg of compound tested.<br>
The results of the above biological tests demonstrates that the compounds of the instant invention are potent openers of the large-conductance calcium-activated K+ channels (Maxi-K or BK channels). Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of human disorders arising from dysfunction of cellular membrane polarization and conductance and, preferably, are indicated for the treatment of ischemia, stroke, convulsions, epilepsy, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence and especially male erectile dysfunction, other disorders sensitive to BK channel activating activity.<br>
In another embodiment, this invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I in combination with a pharmaceutical adjuvant, carrier or diluent.<br>
In still another embodiment, this invention relates to a method of treatment or prevention of disorders responsive to opening of potassium<br><br><br>
channels in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
For therapeutic.use, the pharmacologically active compounds of Formula I will normally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising as the (or an) essential active ingredient at least one such compound in association with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with pharmaceutically acceptable adjutants and excipients employing standard and conventional techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions include suitable dosage forms for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and intravenous) bronchial or nasal administration. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation may be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The solid carrier may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tableting lubricants, disintegrants, wetting agents and the like. The tablet may, if desired, be film coated by conventional techniques. If a liquid carrier is employed, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile vehicle for injection, an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension, or may be a dry product for reconstftution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, wetting agents, non-aqueous vehicle (including edible oils), preservatives, as well as flavoring and/or coloring agents. For parenteral administration, a vehicle normally will comprise sterile water, at least in large part, although saline solutions, glucose solutions and like may be utilized. Injectable suspensions also may be used, in which case conventional suspending agents may be employed. Conventional preservatives, buffering agents and the like<br><br><br>
also may be added to the parenteral dosage forms. Particularly useful is the administration of a compound of Formula I directly in parenteral formulations. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques appropriate to the desired preparation    — containing appropriate amounts of the active ingredient, that is, the compound of Formula I according to the invention. See, for example, Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 17th edition, 1985.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of Formula I to achieve a therapeutic effect will depend not only on such factors as the age, weight and sex of the patient and mode of administration, but also on the degree of potassium channel activating activity desired and the potency of the particular compound being utilized for the particular disorder of disease concerned, it is also contemplated that the treatment and dosage of the particular compound may be administered in unit dosage form and that the unit dosage form would be adjusted accordingly by one skilled in the art to reflect the relative level of activity. The decision as to the particular dosage to be employed (and the number of times to be administered per day) is within the discretion of the physician, and may be varied by titration of the dosage to the particular circumstances of this invention to produce the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
A suitable dose of a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutical composition thereof for a mammal, including man, suffering from, or likely to suffer from any condition as described herein is an amount of active ingredient from about 0.01 u.g/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight and preferrably, from about 0.1 ng/kg to 5 mg/kg body weight for oral administration. For parenteral administration, the dose may be in the range of 0.1 u.g/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight for intravenous administration The active ingredient will preferably be administered in equal doses from<br><br>
one to four times a day. However, usually a small dosage is administered, and the dosage is gradually increased until the optimal dosage for the host under treatment is determined.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be employed alone or in combination with other suitable therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of sexual dysfunction such as cGMP PDE inhibitors and particularly cGMP PDE V inhibitors such as sildenafil.   Exemplary of the therapeutic agents are PDE V inhibitors selected from imidazo-quinazolines (see WO 98/08848), carbazoles (see WO 97/03675, WO 97/03985 and WO 95/19978), imidazopurinones (see WO 97/19947), benzimidazoles (see WO 97/24334), pyrazoloquinolines (see U.S. Patent 5,488,055), anthranilic acid derivatives (see WO 95/18097), fused heterocycles (see WO 98/07430) and thienopyrimidines (see DE 19632423).<br>
The above therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention, may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physician"s Desk Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound of be administered, the chosen route of administration, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient"s symptoms.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way inasmuch as many variations of the invention are possible within the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
