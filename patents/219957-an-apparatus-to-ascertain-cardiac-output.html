TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
       A NEW METHOD OF MEASURING CARDIAC RELATED PARAMETERS NON-INVASIVELY VIA THE LUNG DURING SPONTANEOUS AND CONTROLLED<br>
      5     VENTILATION<br>
HELD Of THE INVENTION<br>
        This invention, discloses a method that calculates noninvasively, via the lung, the<br>
        10   total cardiac output, pulmonary blood flow, shunt flow, anatomical and alveolar deadspace, true mixed venous Q2 saturation, true mixed venous FCO2, and PaCO2. Furthermore the method can be performed in ventilated subjects, subjects breathing spontaneously, even in the presence of variations in their tidal volume and breathing frequency. Subjects need not perform any respiratory manoeuvre such as <br>
      15     hyperventilation or breath holding to perform the test<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Importance of cardiac output<br>
       20<br>
A physician's ability to determine a patient's cardiac output {Q, the volume of blood pumped by the heart each minute) is important in the assessment of critically ill patients. There are various devices and methods that provide a direct or indirect measure of Q  (see table 1). The most common method used in clinical practice is<br>
25  theme-dilution, established by Ganz et al (1). Commercially manufactured catheters (referred to as Swan-Ganz catheters, named after the inventors) contain multiple lumina, an embedded thermister, and a balloon at the tip. The method requires the insertion of the catheter through the skin to access a large central vein such as the internal jugular, subclavian, cephalic or femoral. When the balloon at the<br>
30   end of the catheter is inflated, the catheter tip is carried along with the flow of blood to the right ventricle of the heart and then into the pulmonary artery. The part of the catheter that remains outside the body has connections that can be attached to electrical sensors that determine the pressure and temperature in the pulmonary artery where the tip of the catheter is positioned. Calculation of Q requires the<br>
2_<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 2<br>
       injection of a fixed volume of cool liquid of known temperature into a lumen of the catheter that has its opening part way along its length (usually in a part of the catheter in the right atrium). The thermister at the tip of the catheter will register changes in temperature as the cool liquid, carried by the blood, passes. The extent of <br>
5    dilution of the cold bolus of liquid by warm blood win determine the temporal profile of the temperature change at the tip of me catheter. This is referred to as the thermodilution method of measuring cardiac output (TD Q).<br>
The popularity of TDΩ stems from ease of use once the catheter is in place.<br>
10    However, the placing and maintenance of the catheter entails considerable risk and expense. Insertion of the Swan-Ganz catheter is associated with complications that are frequency fatal such as puncture of the carotid or subclavian artery with associated internal haemorrhage or stroke/ tension pneumothorax, rupture of the right ventricle, malignant azzhythmias (including fatal ventricular fibrillation), and<br>
15 rupture of the pulmonary artery. As a foreign body violating the skin barrier, a pulmonary artery catheter is a constant threat as a source of blood-bom infection that is the greatest risk to heart valves, artificial joints, and other implants. Such infections are medical disasters leading to severe morbidity and death. Furthermore, the use of pulmonary artery catheters to measure TDQ is very expensive as it<br>
20     requires admission to an intensive care facility where there is continuous presence as it<br>
critical care nursing and medical staff. Despite these risks, it is still not the ideal method to measure Q as it tends to overestimate Q by as much as 10% compared to the Pick method (see below) and, for greatest accuracy, requires repeated measurements  as its precision is poor. The variability of repeated single<br>
25   measurements is about 22% and can be reduced to 10% by repeated averages of 9 measurements (2). A single thermodilution measurement is considered to be plus or minus 33% the true value.(3)<br>
Because of die expense and risks of keeping the catheters in place, (hey are removed as soon as practical, often within 24-48 hours of major heart surgery. Often they are<br>
30     removed while the information they provide can still be clinically useful and well<br>

before the patient is no longer at significant risk for relapse. If the patient's health deteriorates, a decision must be made about re-inserting the catheter.<br>
An automated non-invasive method of Q monitoring would be very useful in the <br>
5     following clinical scenarios:<br>
a)	Selected low risk patients now routinely undergoing pulmonary artery catheterization for intra- and postoperative monitoring.<br>
b)	Patients whose Q would be clinically important to know but in whom the risks and costs of insertion of a pulmonary catheter cannot be justified; this<br>
10	includes ward patients, outpatients or patients in. the emergency department<br>
or doctor's office.<br>
c)	Patients who are too sick to warrant the added risk of pulmonary artery<br>
catheter insertion<br>
d)	High and moderate cardiac risk patients undergoing minor and moderate 15               non-cardiac surgical procedures<br>
e)	Severely ill patients with non-cardiac disease.<br>
f)	Relatively healthy patients undergoing major stressful surgery.<br>
g)	Situations in which Q is clinically indicated but there is no access to the<br>
expertise and critical care facilities required for the use of the pulmonary<br>
20	artery catheters.<br>
h) Means of monitoring response to cardiovascular therapy such as for<br>
             hypertension and heart failure,<br>
        i)   As a non-invasive diagnostic test of cardio-pulmonary status.                                                                                j)   As a means of assessing cardiovascular fitness. <br>
25<br>
       Despite these many applications, non-invasive methods of Q measurements have not obtained widespread clinical acceptance. The most commonly researched methods include ECG bio-impedance (Imhoff. 2000 (4)), and pulsed-wave Doppler esophageal sonography. These methods have good repeatability (5-12) and good<br>
30   limits of agreement with either thermodilution or Fick-based methods but only in some populations of subjects. Each method fails in certain patients groups with such<br>

pathologies as very high or low Q states as occur in surgical patients, septic shock, exercise or cardiogenic shock.<br>
2. Background physiology and definition of terms<br>
5<br>
Venous blood returns to the right side of the heart from the muscles and organs with reduced oxygen (O2) and increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Blood from various parts of the body is mixed in the right side of the heart and pumped to me rungs via the pulmonary artery. The blood in the pulmonary artery is known as the mixed<br>
10   venous blood In the lungs the blood vessels break up into a network of small vessels that surround tiny rung sacs known as afoeoli. This network of vessels surrounding the alveoli provides a large surface area for the exchange of gases by diffusion along their partial pressure gradients. After a bream of air is inhaled into the lungs, ft dilutes the CO2 left in the alveoli at the end of the previous expiration, thereby<br>
15   establishing a pressure gradient between the partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) in the mixed venous blood (PD CO2) arriving at the alveoli and the alveolar PCO2 (PACO2). The CO2 diffuses into the alveoli from the mixed venous blood diminishing the PCO2 in the blood, and increasing the PCO2 in the alveoli until equilibrium is established between the PCO2 in alveolar capillary blood and the PCO2 in the alveoli. The blood<br>
20   then returns to the left side of the heart via the pulmonary vein and is pumped into the arterial system by the left ventricle. The PCO2 in the arterial; blood (PaCO2) is now the same as mat in the alveoli. When the subject exhales, the gas at the very end of exhalation is considered to have come from the alveoli and thus simultaneously reflects the PCO2 in the pulmonary capillaries and the alveoli; the PCO2 in this gas is<br>
25     called me end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2).<br>
       The volume of gas breathed per minute, or minute ventilation (VB), is measured at the airway opening (nose and/mouth) and is expressed in L/min. The volume of breathed gas distributed to the alveoli (and thus contributing to gas exchange) is<br>
30  termed the alveolar ventilation (VA) and is also expressed in L/min The part of VB that does not contribute to gas exchange is termed dead space ventilation.  This is<br>
5 <br>

PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 5<br>
       divided into the anatomical dead space that consists of the trachea and other gas-conducting tubes leading from the nose and mouth to the alveoli, and the alveolar dead space mat is collectively the alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused with blood. <br>
5<br>
The VB during normal breathing provides the VA that is required to eliminate the<br>
CO2 brought to the lungs. VB is controlled by a feedback system to keep PaCO2 at a set level of approximately 40 mmHg. Under steady state conditions, the rate at which CO2 is exhaled from the lungs {VCO2) is equal to the rate that it is brought to<br>
10   the lungs, which in turn is equal to the metabolic CO2 production. We define steady state as the condition in which the flux of CO2 at the lungs is equal to the CO: production and the VCO2, PvCO2 and FaCO2 remain steady. If-the VCO2 is diminished, the CO2 extraction from the mixed venous blood passing by the alveoli will be reduced resulting in an increase in the PaCQ2 when that blood reaches the<br>
15   arterial system. As the blood traverses the body, it will pick up additional CO2 and will. return to the pulmonary artery with a higher PCO2 than on its previous passage. The time between the change in VCO2 and re reappearance of the blood with raised FCO2 in the mixed venous circulation is termed the recirculation time which is generally taken as 20-30 a in resting subjects.<br>
20<br>
3. The Fick equation<br>
The approach for respiratory-based methods for measuring Q non-invasively is described by the Fick equation, a mass balance of any substance across the lungs.<br>
25  The Fick method was originally described for O2 as a method for determining pulmonary blood flow. The Fick relation states that the O2 uptake by the lung is equal to the difference between the pulmonary artery and systemic arterial O2 contents times the Q. The blood contents originally had to be obtained invasively from blood samples. The same relation holds with respect to O2 The advantage of<br>
30    using C O2 as the tracer is that mixed venous and arterial blood contents of C O2 may be determined non-invasively. The Fick mass balance equation for C O2 is:<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2OO4/O00234<br><br>
Page 6<br><br><br><br><br><br>
where Q is the cardiac output, VC O2 is the rate of elimination of CO* at the lungs, Cv CO2 and CaC O2 are the mixed venous and systemic arterial contents of C O2,<br>
5 respectively. VCO2 can be measured by a timed collection of expired gas and measuring its volume and CO2 concentration. The term CaCO2 can be calculated using an estimate of arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) as derived from the PC O2 of end tidal gas (PETCO2). The hemoglobin concentration (easily obtained from a venous blood sample or a drop of blood from a finger prick) and the relation between blood PCO2<br>
10 and CO2 content (available from standard physiology texts) are then used to calculate CaCO2.<br>
However, CvC O2 is difficult to estimate. The PCO2 of mixed venous blood (EVCO2) is difficult to determine as true mixed venous blood is present only in the pulmonary<br>
15   artery, which is inaccessible from the surface. The air in the lungs is in intimate contact with mixed venous blood, but CO2 diffuses rapidly from me mixed venous blood into the alveoli before an equilibrium is established. The PCO2 of the expired gas therefore reflects this equilibrium PCO2 and not the PCO2 of mixed venous blood. The PvCO2 can be determined from expired gas only when there has been<br>
20 full equilibration with continuously replenished mixed venous blood or partial equilibration under controlled conditions that allow for back calculation of PvCO2 from the PCOz in expired gas. Hence during rebreathing, the alveolar gas is not refreshed and the mixed venous blood continuously passes the alveoli such that an equilibrium is established whereby the PBTCOZ reflects the PCOz in mixed venous<br>
25     blood.<br>
However, even in this scenario, the PCO2 is not that which exists in the pulmonary<br>
artery.  Blood in the pulmonary artery has a relatively low PO2.  Because of the<br>
Haldane effect, the low PO2 allows the COz to be carried by the hemoglobin at a<br>
30     relatively low PCO2. When the mixed venous blood is exposed to gas in the alveoli,<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 7<br>
Oz diffuses into the blood, binds to the hemoglobin and increases the PCQj needed for a given CO* content on the hemoglobin (the complimentary aspect of the Haldane effect). All methods based on full or partial equilibration of alveolar gas with Pv COz take into account that the equilibration is to a virtual PCO2 that would<br>
5    exist if the CO content of the hemoglobin were the same as in mixed venous blood bat the hemoglobin were saturated with Q&gt;. We refer to this as the oxygenated mixed venous PCO2(PvCO2-oxy). Because the relationship between PCO2 and content of C O2 in blood is known, Cv COz can be calculated from both the true PvCO2* (as obtained, for example, from a pulmonary arterial blood sample) and<br>
10     Pv CO2-oxy (as obtained by some of the non-invasive methods described below)*.<br>
4. Rebreathing-equilibration method<br>
One method of measuring Pv CO-oxy was introduced by Collier in 1956, and is<br>
known as the equilibration method. A bag is pr&amp;-filled with a high concentration of<br>
15   CO2 (-10-13%) and the subject exhales and inhales rapidly to and from the bag and PCO2 is monitored continuously at the mouth. The object of the test is to find the combination of bag volume and bag concentration of CO* such that once the gas in the bag mixes with that in the lungs (the concentration of C O2 in tine residual gas in the lung at the end. of a bream in a healthy person is -5.5%), the partial pressure of<br>
20   COz in the lung is equal to that in mixed venous blood. A flat segment of the FCO2 tracing segment indicates that inspired and expired PCO2 are equal To identify the true Pv C O2-oxy, the flat segment must occur within the first 3-4 breaths, before recirculation raises the Pv CO2-oxy (see Figure 8).<br>
25<br>
4.11    Advantages of the equilibration method:<br>
The Pv~COj-oxy does not really exist but is a virtual number created by instantaneously oxygenating mixed venous blood before and diffusion of CO} into 4c alveoli. The CvCO2 is the same in each.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004//000234<br><br>
Page 8<br>
The capnograph reading is of gas equilibrated with Pv-CO2-oxy and can be considered a directly measured value as opposed to a value obtained from calculation or extrapolation.<br>
5	4.1.2 limitations of the equilibration method:<br>
            4.1.2.1 The COz concentration in the bag depends on bag size, the patient's<br>
lung volume, and the Pv C02-oxy— the last being the unknown value.<br>
Therefore, the concentration of CO2 in the bag must be individualized<br>
to the patient and thus found by trial and error. The method is therefore<br>
10	difficult to automate fully.<br>
                    4.1.22 In practice, since the characteristic of a suitable endpoint (the plateau of<br>
                               PCO2) is subjective, identification of a suitable plateau is difficult to<br>
                               automats.<br>
                    41.23 The manoeuvre of rebreathing from a bag is difficult to perform in<br>
15	mechanically ventilated patients and is therefore not suitable for such<br>
                               patients.<br>
                   4.1.24 Inhaling 10-13% COz is very uncomfortable and most people cannot<br>
                                tolerate it  It is particularly uncomfortable to someone who is short of<br>
                                bream or exercising.<br>
20	4.1.2.5 The method requires an external source of CO2.  This makes testing<br>
                                 equipment bulky and awkward.<br>
                    4.1.2.6 The method requires mat the subject hyperventilate in order to mix<br>
                                 thoroughly the gas in the bag and the lungs before recirculation of<br>
                                 blood takes place. This requirement limits the test to those subjects who<br>
25	can perform this manoeuvre and who can provide this degree of<br>
                               cooperation. The excludes patients who have severe lung disease, those<br>
                                who are too young, too confused or too 31 to cooperate.<br>
                     4.12.7 The test loads a considerable volume of COz into the subject's lungs and<br>
                                at the same time prevents CO2 from leaving the blood for the duration<br>
30	of the test This has negative consequences for the subject<br>
412.7.1    Following the test, the subject must hyperventilate to eliminate the applied CO2 load as well as the volume of metabolically-produced<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 9<br>
                               CO2 not eliminated during the test This may pose a considerable<br>
burden for some subjects with lung disease or exercising subjects who<br>
are already expending considerable effort to cope with their existing<br>
metabolic CO2 load.<br>
5	4.1.2.7.2    A period of hyperventilation following the test is required to<br>
eliminate the CO2. This may be difficult for some subjects to perform and, consequently, they may experience respiratory distress for some time until their PCO2 is decreased.<br>
4.12.73     Repeated tests must be delayed until the extra CO2 is eliminated<br>
10	and the baseline state re-established.<br>
4.1.2.7.4    The test itself may distress the subject and alter the Q.<br>
5. Rebreathing- Exponential Method<br>
          In this technique, a small amount of CO2 is placed in a bag and the subject asked to<br>
15     rebreathe from the bag. The PBICO2s of successive breaths will rise exponentially towards PvCO2-oxy. A rising exponential curve is then fit to the PETCO2S of these breams to predict an asymptotic value that is assumed to be the Pv CO2-oxy (See Figure 9).<br>

25	52.1    This is an indirect test in which the PvCO2-oxy is not measured<br>

                   522   As the metabolic production of CO2 is small compared to me size of the<br>
                              lung and bag, the rise of PCO2 occurs over a prolonged period. This<br>

using a single exponential is that the assumptions underlying the method are incorrect la fact, the method produces two different mathematical profiles: the one describing the washout of CO2 from me lung into the bag is a decreasing exponential whereas the second<br>
5	describing the build-up of CO2released from Hie blood into the lung-<br>
bag mixture is an increasing exponential (13). Only after the gases in the lung-bag system have become well mixed do the two exponentials resolve to a single exponential. By then, very few breaths (if any) that can provide suitable data for extrapolation from a single exponential<br>
10	can be taken before recirculation<br>
5.2.4   A continually rising level of CO2 makes this test unpleasant in conscious patients, especially in those exercising or very ilL<br>
52.5	The manoeuvre of rebreathing from a bag is difficult to perform in<br>
mechanically ventilated patients and is therefore not suitable far such<br>
15	patients.<br>
52.6	The method requires an external source of CO2. This makes testing equipment bulky and awkward.<br>
52.7	The test loads a volume of CO2 into the subject's lungs and at the same time prevents CO2 from leaving the blood for the duration of the test<br>
20	Although me extent of the CO* load on the subject is less than with the<br>
equilibration method, the negative consequences for the subject; outlined in the section on the equilibration method (discussed above/ must be considered.<br>

asymptote, but the increased CO2 concentrations increase the discomfort and the limitations approach those outlined above for the equilibration method.<br>

6.0 Calculating Q without first calculating Pv CO2-oxy<br>
Gedeon in 1980 described a method of calculating Q in ventilated patients via a differential Pick method that circumvents the need to calculate Pv CO2-oxy.  The<br>
5 underlying assumptions of the method are that and Q PvCO2 will remain unchanged during a step change in lung CO2 elimination and alveolar PCO2 (PACQ2) lasting less than a recirculation time (about 30 seconds). Gedeon proposed reducing lung CO2 elimination by reducing either the tidal volume or respiratory frequency setting of the ventilator. As a modification of this method, Orr et al.<br>
10 proposed leaving the ventilator settings unchanged and reducing lung COi elimination by temporarily interposing a dead space between the ventilator and the patient's airway resulting in a transient period of rebreathing previously exhaled gas-<br>
15     6.1 Theoretical basis of Gedeon/Orr method;<br>
The method applies to a subject being ventilated under control conditions in which CO2 elimination and PETCO2 are measured A test manoeuvre consisting of a transient alteration in the CO2 elimination fox a time less man a recirculation time is effected and the resulting "equilibrium" PBTCO2 is noted. It is assumed that the Q<br>
20   and Pv CO2-oxy during the test are unchanged from control conditions. The Fick equation for these two conditions can be written as<br><br><br><br><br>
25 where VCO2 is the CO2 flux at the lungs during the test and CaCO2 'is the corresponding 'new arterial content of CO2. These two equations can be combined to yield the differential form of Fick's equation:<br>
12<br><br>
WO 0004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 12<br><br><br><br>
where A denotes a "difference in". Since the PaCO2 and Pv CO2-owy lie on the same CO2 dissociation curve, partial pressures of CO2 can be substituted for CO2 content to yield the following relation:<br>
5       	<br><br>
' where S is the slope of the CO2 dissociation carve. like the conventional non¬invasive CO2-based Pick method, the differential Pick method relies on predicting PaCO2 through measurements of PETCO2. However, instead of requiring a calculation of PvCO2-oxy, the differential Pick equation assumes no change in<br>
10    Pv CO-oxy over the duration of the test, and uses the measured quantities VCO2 and VCO2 and well as PaCO2 and PaCO2 (from PETCO2) to calculate the remaining unknown value in the equation: Q.<br>
6.2 Advantages of Gedeon/Orr method <br>
15     62.1   The main advantage is that Pv CO* does not need to be calculated.<br>
6.2L2   If the deadspace method is used to alter the VCO2, then no change in<br>
         breathing pattern is required. <br>
         6.23   The method can, theoretically, be fully automated, (In its present commercial form, the size of the interposed deadspace must still be altered manually). 20<br>
63 Limitations of Gedeon/Orr method<br>
There are a number of limitations in applying  Orr'S method to spontaneously ventilating subjects.<br>
63.1    In spontaneously breathing subjects, there is considerable bream-to-breath<br>
25	variation in breath size and breathing frequency resulting in a variation in<br>
PBICO2. This poses problems with respect to:<br>
63.1.1 Identification   of   FBTCO2   and   PEICO1.   Long   periods   of   baseline<br>
measurements are needed in order to average the end tidal values and<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 13<br>
                    identify the PETCO2 to be used as the baseline PETCO2 in the differential Fick<br>
equation. The test phase cannot last for more than about 30 seconds (due to<br>
recirculation), typically 5 breaths. This leaves little time to determine an<br>
accurate average PETCO2'. During prolonged baseline periods of observation,<br>
5	the condition of the patient may change.<br>
6.3.L2 Calculation of VCO2. The variations in PBTCO2 are related to variations in CO2 elimination but the relationship is not consistently reflected by the PBTCO2. For example, assuming a subject breathing at rest with an average resting breath size, an interposed smaller breath may result in a lower<br>
10	PETCO2 (due to a smaller contribution of alveolar gas to me end tidal sample)<br>
but the CO2 elimination from that breath will be diminished. Conversely, a larger breath may result in the same PETCO2 as the resting breath but a greater volume of CO2 is eliminated. The commercial automated Gedeon method (NICO2, Novametrics Medical Systems, Wallingford, CT, USA.)<br>
15	measures   the  CO?   eliminated  breath-by-bream   and  therefore   must<br>
continuously average the values to measure VCO2. The NICO2 method of<br>
calculating VCO2 by real-time integration of continuous measurements of<br>
flow (with a pneumotachymeter) and CO2 concentration (with a capnogxaph)<br>
is fraught with potential for errors: a small error in the integration of these<br>
20	two signals with different time delays and time constants results in a much<br>
larger error in the calculation of VCO2. In addition, the greater the variability of the breath size and CO2 concentrations, the longer the measurement time<br>
required for an accurate estimate of V CO2.<br>
632.   Calculation of VCO2'. Stable transient changes in VCO2 can not be achieved in<br>
25	conscious spontaneously ventilating patients:<br>
6.3.2.1 Interposing a deadspace and raising their PCO2 will stimulate spontaneously<br>
breathing conscious subjects to increase their VB and VCO2 until the PBTCO2 is restored. 6322 Any change in breath size or frequency during a period of breathing, (a<br>
30	normal occurrence in spontaneously breathing people) changes the VCO2<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 14<br>
during that period. During inspiration, the deadspace gas is inhaled first followed by fresh gas. A decrease in a breath size or frequency diminishes the<br>
                    volume of fresh gas inhaled (and thus the VCO2 for that breath). An increase<br>
                     in breath size or frequency will result in an increased volume of fresh gas<br>
5	delivered to the alveoli<br>
63.25 Each breath is an independent event and there is no inherent method to<br>
compensate in a subsequent breath for changes in VCO2 in the preceding<br>
breath. For the method to be implemented, therefore, measures must be<br>
taken to ensure that breath size and frequency stay absolutely constant<br>
10	during the test   The NICD2 method has no such built-in aspects.   The<br>
method can therefore be used only in patients who have precisely uniform breathing pattern such as those that are paralysed and mechanically ventilated.<br>
15 6.33 Identification of PETCO2PaCO2 gradient The Gedeon and Orr methods assume, ox require the establishment of, a constant gradient between the PBTCO2 and the PaCO2. The variation in PETCO2 is due to variations of distribution of fresh gas to various parts of the lung and any one bream does not reflect the overall state of CO* exchange. On the other hand, such<br>
20	variations are not reflected in the PETCO2 which does reflect the overall<br>
exchange of CO2 and remains relatively constant Therefore, variations in PETCO2 also confound the quantification of me PBTCO2-PaCO2 gradient under control conditions. Although Orr provides a number of equations to correct for these limitations, these equations are empirical and do not<br>
25	necessarily apply to a particular patient   For example, they are applied<br>
whether or not there is irregular breathing.<br>
The PETCO2-PaCO2 gradient during the test phase when rebreathing occurs is<br>
unknown, hi the presence of large alveolar deadspace (as commonly occurs<br>
30	in many ill patients} the PsrCQrPaCQt gradient will change during the<br>
rebreathing phase. Orr provides some equations to correct for this but since<br>
15<br><br>
WO 200W73482<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>
Page 15<br>
the volume of the alveolar deadspace is unknown, the applicability of the formula to any particular patient is unknown. This further diminishes the accuracy of calculating PaCO2.<br>
The manoeuvres required to determine each of the terms required to calculate Q<br>
(VCO2, VCO2, PBTCO2, PETCO2' and PaCO2) by the Orr/ Gedeon / NICO2 method is awkward to implement and prone to errors in measurement in the presence of any variation in breath amplitude or breathing frequency as occurs in spontaneously breathing humans or animals.<br>
10<br>
63A The parameter calculated by the differential Fick method as practiced by Gedeon/Orr/Respironics is pulmonary blood flow (Q p). Pulmonary blood flow may be less than the total cardiac output (Q t) when, for example, some of the Q    is shunted from the right side of the circulation (superior vena<br>
15	cava, right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery) into the left side of the<br>
circulation without passing through the lungs. This is referred to as "shunt" (Qs). About 5% of venous blood bypasses the lungs (termed shunted blood) in healthy adults. Much larger shunts occur in marry medical conditions such as congenital heart disease, surgical repair of some congenital heart diseases,<br>
20	pneumonia,  pulmonary edema, asthma, pulmonary  atelectasis, adult<br>
respiratory distress syndrome, obesity, pregnancy, liver disease and others. The differential Pick method does not include shunted blood in the calculation of Q and other empiric corrections must be made to account for it<br>
25     7.0Kim-Rahn Farhi method <br>
            7.1 Theory:<br>
         A unique maneuver was proposed by Km, Rahn and Farhi, Q. AppL Physiol 21:1388-44.1966.) as a way to calculate the oxygenated mixed venous PCOz (Pv CO2-oxy) as well as the true Pv COz and PaCO2. It is based on a paradigm of taking a breath of<br>
30     O2, holding the breath, and exhaling slowly over a period equal to the recirculation<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/073482<br><br>

time. Over this lime of exhalation, the CO2 from the mixed venous blood will diffuse into the alveoli and Os will be absorbed. The low PO2 in the red blood cells in the mixed venous blood maximizes the volume of CO2 that can be carried by hemoglobin. Oxygen from the alveoli diffuses into the red blood cells, raising the<br>
5     PO2 and decreasing me affinity of hemoglobin for COz (Haldane effect). This releases COz from the binding sites on the hemoglobin, making it available for diffusion into the alveoli. With breath holding, CO2 will accumulate in the alveoli and the alveolar PCO2 (PACO2)will rise until it no longer provides a gradient for diffusion from me blood. (This PCO2 is known as the oxygenated mixed venous PCO2 (PvCO2-oxy).),<br>
10   However, O2 will continue to diffuse as long as the PAO2 is greater man Pv O2. Relatively little CO2 need diffuse into the alveoli to reach Pv CO2-oxy compared to the volume of Oz mat is available for uptake before the PO2 in the pulmonary capillary blood is in equilibrium with the PAO2. In other words, this equilibration of CO: in the alveoli with the mixed venous blood will occur well before mat of O2.<br>
15<br>
Since both O2 and CO2 are contained in the same physical volume, the changes in concentrations of each gas over a short period will reflect the rates of flux of mat gas over the same period. Therefore, over a short period, the ratio of PCO2 to PO» will reflect the respiratory quotient, RQ (denned as the rate of CO2 diffusion from the<br>
20    blood into the alveoli divided by the rate of O2 absorption into the blood from the alveoli). The RQ will initially be highest at the beginning of the breath when the rate of CO2 diffusion into the alveoli is maximal, and will approach 0 when the alveolar PCO2 equals Pv CO2-oxy. In vitro studies have shown that PACO2 equals the true PvCO2 when the RQ = 0.32 and equals PaCO2 when RQ is equal to the patient's<br>
25     steady state RQ (typically -0.8).<br>
      72. Test method <br>
   The method suggested for performing this test would require a subject to take a maximum breath of 100% Oz and exhale very slowly and maximally. Over die course 30 of this exhalation, expired gas is sampled and analyzed continuously for both PO2 and PCO2. PO2 is graphed vs. PCO2 and the RQ is calculated from the instantaneous slope of tangents to the curves at various PCO2 values as follows:<br>

PCT/CA2004/000234<br><br>

RQ _ slope ~(FeO2* slope) – FeCO2 (FeO, * slope) – FeCO2,<br>
These RQ values are then plotted against their respective PCO2 data points resulting <br>
5     in a linear relation as illustrated in figures 4 and 5 of IS. Kin, H. Rahn, and L. E  Farhi cited above.<br>
73 Advantages of the method.<br>
7.3.1	This is the only known non-invasive method by -which true Pv CQj can<br>
10	be calculated.<br>
7.3.2	The method provides an estimate of PaCO2 not based on assuming a gradient between PETCO2 and PaCO2.<br>
7.3.3	Data generated by the method can be used to calculate the d saturation of mixed venous blood.<br>
15<br>
- 7A Limitations of the Kim- Rahn-Farhi breath-hold method.<br>
The main limitation of this method is mat it requires the subject to have a large hmg capacity, hold his breath, and exhale over a prolonged duration. Patients with<br>
20 conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, obesity, trauma, abdominal and chest surgery, mental obtundatian, confusion, pregnancy and many others have marked limitations in their ability to take a large breath. Patients ate required to cooperate with their duration of breath holding and rate of exhalation. Many<br>
25    patients who are ill, exercising subjects, children and others are unable to perform this satisfactorily. This method is very awkward to automate or perform on ventilated patients.<br>

In a steady state, if a subject breathes in a PCO2 equal to Pv CO2-oxy, there will be no gradient for gas exchange and the difference in PCO2 between the inspired PCO2 (PrCO2) and the expired PCO2 (PECO2) will be 0. The volume of CO2 diffusing into the alveoli will be maximal when the difference between PlCO2 and PBCO2 is<br>
5 greatest ie., what the PCO2 is 0. Since the change in alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) varies directly as the volume of CO2 diffusing into the alveoli and the volume diffusing into the alveoli varies directly as the gradient, then the difference between the F1CO2 and PECQZ will vary inversely as P1CQ2. In other words, graphing the difference between the PECO* and PlCQz (PECOI - PlCQz) vs. PICO* will result in a straight line. Since<br>
10 subjects normally breathe room air (PrCQz equals 0 or Ox the control PElCQz provides the first point on the graph. When subjects inhale gas with any constant value of PCQ2, the PHTCOz at the end of an equilibration period not exceeding the time for recirculation will provide a second data point which can be used to. define the straight line which crosses the X axis where PlCQz equals Pv CQ2-oxy.<br>
15.<br>
82 Test method: The subject breathes via a non-rebreathing valve. The inspiratory limb is provided with either fresh gas or test gas with any PCQ2, To perform a test the inspired gas is switched from control gas to test gas for about one recirculation time. The P1CO2 of<br>
20 the test gas, the PETCQZ just before the test (when PiCQ2 was 0), and the PETCO2 of the last breath before recirculation are used to calculate the Pv CQ2-oxy.<br>
8.3 Advantages of the Prior Disclosed Previous Fisher method:<br>
8.3.1	Any low inspired concentration of CQz such as 1% is adequate to<br>
25	generate a data point; therefore the subject need not get a large CO2<br>

Page 21 SUMMARY Of THE INVENTION<br>
This invention discloses a method and apparatus for calculating all of the Q regardless of shunt, calculating the shunt, anatomical and alveolar deadspace, true <br>
5     mixed venous O2 saturation, true mixed venous PCO2, and PaCO2. Furthermore the method and apparatus can be used with ventilated subjects, subjects breathing spontaneously/ even with marked variations in their tidal volume and breathing frequency, or subjects undergoing surgery under anaesthesia. Subjects need not perform any respiratory manoeuvre such as hyperventilation or breath, holding.<br>
10<br>
       According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an improved method and apparatus for the purposes of determining Q and VA and calculating VCO2, PvCO2-oxy, true PvCO2, PaCQ2, pulmonary shunt, and anatomical dead space which increases the accuracy of these determinations in relation to known methods <br>
15    and apparatus and allows the full automation of the various methods disclosed herein for these determinations and calculations<br>
The new method:<br>
2.   is insensitive to changes in minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume and/or<br>
20	respiratory frequency so that the method can be carried out in spontaneously<br>
breathing subjects; 2.   is simplified and less expensive to construct compared to other non-invasive automated methods of performing the differential Pick technique in that<br>
a.	it does not necessarily require any mechanically activated valves to<br>
25                          be actively engaged in the patient circuit<br>
b.	does not require a pneumotachygraph to measure flows<br>
c.	does not require manual adjustment of an interposed dead space (and<br>
thus can be totally automated);<br>
d.	The device will be the same for all sizes of adults (one size fits all)<br>
30        3.   is compatible with a number of sequential gas delivery breathing (SGDB) circuits. A SGDB circuit provides for the sequential delivery of two gas sets<br>

to the lungs during inhalation. A gas set is composed of one or more gases and vapors. The first gas set (PCS) is provided from the beginning of inhalation and can terminate at some time during inhalation depending on the FGS flow and the VB, at which time inhalation continues with the<br>
5	delivery of the second gas set (SGS). For the purposes of measuring Q and<br>
the other physiologic parameters described herein, it is preferred that there is a distinct transition from FGS to SGS and there is no mixing of the gas sets. A small degree of mixing of FGS with SGS during the latter part of inhalation will reduce accuracy of the measured and calculated results. Mathematical<br>
10	corrections can be made to minimize effect of the mixing of FGS with SGS,<br>
but cannot completely negate the effects in all circumstances.   Therefore,<br>
breathing circuits which separate the FGS from the SGS are preferred.<br>
i.   the generation and presentation of data will be substantially the same for<br>
controlled (mechanical) ventilation and rebreathing so that the algorithms to<br>
15	perform, the tests and analyze the data can be substantially die same;<br>
5.	can institute an equnlibrium steady state within one recirculation time so mat<br>
the value for FETCO2 will be a true measured value rather than one requiring<br>
multiple corrections based on unsubstantiated assumptions;<br>
6.	will allow the measurement of a new steady state PETCO2 within one<br>
20	recirculation time and thus actualize the assumption underlying the<br>
Differential Pick approach that Pv CO2 is unchanged;<br>
7.	will minimize the effect of changes in tidal volume on the alveolar<br>
ventilation.<br>
8.	maintain   the   alveolar   PQ2   while   making   pulmonary   blood   flow<br>
25	measurements;<br>
9.	make all calculations without a requirement to measure breath-by-breath<br>
volumes of inspired and expired CQ2 or any flows of tidal gases.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an improved apparatus<br>
30     and method of identifying the alveolar ventilation (VA), substantially as Illustrated<br>
and described herein, preferably the VA so determined is utilized to calculate the<br>

Detailed Description of Breathing Circuits<br>
     figure 5 shows a breathing circuit which provides sequential delivery of the PGS<br>
followed by the SGS when VE exceeds FGSF, with the manifold containing the<br>
valves and the PGS reservoir bag and the expiratory gas reservoir bag remote from<br>
15        the patient   This improvement reduces the bulk of the patient manifold, and<br>
eliminates ti»a possibility of the SGS mixing with the FGS due to vigorous exhalation.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, Patient (38) breathes via a Y connector (40). Valve (31) is an inspiratory valve and valve (33) is an expiratory valve. Valve (35) is a bypass valve<br>
20    in the bypass limb (34) that bypasses the expiratory valve (33) and has an opening pressure greater than inspiratory valve (31). Valves (35,33) may be close to or distal from the patient manifold as desired, as long as they are on the expiratory limb (39). However, in the preferred embodiment, they are distal to the patient to reduce the bulk of the patient manifold. Inspiratory valve (31) may be close to, or distal from,<br>
25    the patient manifold as desired/ as long as it is on the inspiratory limb (32). In the preferred embodiment it is distal to tine patient as well. PGS enters the circuit via port (30).<br>
         Function:<br>
 30     During exhalation, increased pressure in the circuit closes inspiratory valve (31) and bypass valve (35). Gas is directed into the exhalation limb (39), past one-way valve<br>
31<br><br>

(33) into the expiratory gas reservoir bag (36). Excess gas is vented via port (41) in expiratory gas reservoir bag (36). FGS enters via port (30) and fills FGS reservoir (37). During inhalation, inhalation valve (31) opens and FGS from the FGS reservoir (37) and FGS port (30) enter the inspiratory limb (32) and are delivered to the patient<br>
5    If FGSF is less than VB, the FGS reservoir (37) empties before the end of the breath, and continued respiratory effort results in a further reduction in pressure in the circuit When the opening pressure of the bypass valve (35) is reached, it opens and gas from the expiratory gas reservoir (36) passes into the expiratory limb (39) and makes up the balance of the breath with SGS.<br>
10<br>
Thus when FGSF is less than VB, the subject inhales FGS, then SGS, and no contamination of FGS occurs.<br>
Figure 36 shows an alternate embodiment of the circuit illustrated in. Figure 5 where<br>
15    the passive expiratory valve (33) and expiratory bypass limb (34), and expiratory limb bypass valve (35) are replaced with a control valve that is triggered by the collapse of the inspiratory reservoir. Referring to Figure 3B, a control valve (401) is placed in the expiratory limb (16) anywhere along its length between the patient port (10) and the expiratory reservoir bag (18). When the patient's VE exceeds the FGSF<br>
20 during inspiration the reservoir bag (20) collapses. This is detected by pressure sensing means (405) through port (406) as an acute reduction in pressure. Pressure sensing means (405) could be an electronic pressure transducer capable of detecting changes 2 cm H2O pressure, for example Immediately afterwards, valve (401) is then opened by control means (403), which could be an electronic signal for activating a<br>
25   solenoid valve, for example, leading to depressurization and collapse of a balloon valve, as is known to those skilled in the art, resulting in SGS is being inhaled for the balance of inhalation. During exhalation, patient exhales through expiratory tube (16) past valve (401) into the SGS reservoir (18). At end of exhalation, as detected by pressure sensing means (405) as a reduction of pressure, valve (401) is closed by<br>
30    control means (403), which could be an electronic signal for toggling a solenoid valve, for example, leading to pressurization and inflation of a balloon valve, as is known to -those skilled in the art<br>

While the circuits of Figure 5 and Figure 3B present the advantages over the Fisher circuit of reducing the bulk of the patient manifold, and eliminating the possibility of the SGS mixing with the FGS due to vigorous exhalation, they still have the<br>
5   following drawback: When FGS reservoir (20, 37) is emptied and the patient is breathing SGS for the balance of an inspiration, the circuit does not deliver SGS alone but a mixture of SGS and FGS. The FGS continues to flow into the circuit and is drawn by inhalation past one-way inspiratory valve (31,3) and allows FGS gas to be inhaled from the inspiratory limb (32,14).     To optimize the generation of data<br>
10   required to measure of cardiac output, it is necessary to redirect the FGS into the FGS reservoir (37,20) for the balance of inhalation after the initial collapse of the FGS reservoir. This would prevent mixing of FGS with SGS during the period of inhalation where the patient breathes SGS. This limitation of circuits illustrated in Figures 5 and 3B with, respect to measuring cardiac output are shared with the Fisher<br>
15     circuit -<br>
Figure 3D shows an improved circuit that prevents contamination of the SGS by FGS when SGS is being delivered to the patient Referring to Figure 3D, FGS control valve (400) is added to the inspiratory limb (14) at some point between the FGS port (12)<br>
20   and the inspiratory valve (11). Pop-off valve (425) is connected to the inspiratory limb on the side of the FGS control valve (400) that is proximal to the inspiratory reservoir bag (425). During exhalation, gas passes from the patient port (10), through the expiratory one-way check valve (15) down the expiratory limb (16) into the expiratory reservoir bag (18). Excess gas exits the expiratory reservoir bag (18) at the<br>
25   opening (19) remote from the entrance. FGS enters the circuit at a constant flow via a fresh gas port (12). As the inspiratory one-way check valve (11) is dosed during exhalation, the fresh gas accumulates in the fresh gas reservoir bag (20). During inhalation, FGS entering from the port (12) and the FGS reservoir (20) passes through the inspiratory valve (11) and enters the patient If the FGSF is fess than VE, the<br>
30   FGS reservoir bag (20) collapses, as detected by pressure sensing means (405) connected to pressure sensing port (406). FGS control valve (400) is closed via valve control means (403), and valve (17) in the bypass limb (13) opens, directing<br>

previously exhaled gas to the patient When the FGS control valve (400) is closed, any FGSF entering the circuit during the balance of inspiration is directed only to the SGS reservoir bag (20) and not to the patient, who is receiving SGS for the balance of inspiration. FGS control valve (400) may be ie-opened any time from the beginning<br>
5   of expiration to just before the next inspiration. FGS control valve (400) may be any type of valve, and is preferably an active valve such as a balloon valve, known to those skilled in the art that can be controlled by automated means. The pop-off valve (425) opens when the reservoir bag (20) is full to prevent the reservoir bag (20) from overfilling.<br>
10<br>
The circuit illustrated in Figure 5A is similar to that in Figure 5 but has the addition of a FGS control valve (400), together with pressure sensing means (405) and port (406), and valve control means (403), added to the inspiratory limb of the circuit (32) distal to the one-way inspiratory valve (31) and proximal to tins FGS inflow port (30).<br>
15  Similarly, a FGS control valve, together with pressure sensing means and port, and valve control means, may be added to the inspiratory limb (14) of the circuit illustrated in Figure 3B positioned distal to the one-way inspiratory valve (31) and proximal to the FGS inflow port (12) to achieve me same result, namely, prevention of contamination of SGS by FGS when VE exceeds FGSF and the FGSF reservoir bag<br>
20    is emptied.<br>
We present two additional circuits that are configured by adding FGS control valve (400) together with pressure sensing means (405) and port (406), and valve control means (403). to thu Fiaher circuit and the circuit illustrated in Figure 5 and removing<br>
25   the passive one way inspiratory valve (11, 31), as shown in Figure 3E and 5B respectively. These circuits function identically to those illustrated in Figures 3D and 5A with respect to complete separation of FGS and SGS during inhalation. In such a circuit during inspiration, FGS control valve (400) is open until FGSF reservoir bag (20,37) is emptied, then it is dosed so that any additional FGSF<br>
30   entering the circuit during the balance of inspiration is directed only to the reservoir bag £20) and not to the patient As the patient continues to inspire, bypass valve (1735) opens allowing the patient to inhale SGS for the balance of inspiration.<br>

.Another embodiment of each of the circuits whereby the valves can. be remote from the patient without loss of sequential delivery of FGS and SGS, such as those illustrated in figures 5,3B, 5A, 5B, 3C, 4B, is the replacement of separate inspiratory<br>
5    limbs and expiratory limbs with co-axially arranged inspiratory and expiratory limbs as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6A shows the preferred embodiment of the invention: The circuit valves are configured as in the circuit illustrated in Figure 5A with the improvement of co-axially arranged inspiratory (59) and expiratory (51) limbs. The limbs (51,59) are co-axial so that one limb is contained within the other<br>
10   for some length of tubing, with the limbs separating at some point along its length, such that the expiratory limb (51) leads to the exhaled gas reservoir (54) and the inspiratory limb (59) leads to the FGS reservoir (56). This has two important advantages over the circuit of Figure 5:<br>
1.	A single tube is connected to the patient interface making<br>
15                             it easier to manage sick patients<br>
2.	Tne heat contained in the expiratory limb (51) warms the FGS entering through the inspiratory limb (59).<br>
3.	If the inner tube is of a material mat allows moisture to pass through it but not gas, such as Nation, will promote moisture<br>
20	exchange as well, so that FGS will become slightly moisturized and<br>
more comfortable for the patient to breathe if the SGS is moist It should be understood that co-axial tubing may be used with any of the SGDB circuits described herein.<br>

          circuit during the balance of inspiration is directed only to the PCS reservoir bag p20) and not to the patient, who is inhaling only SGS for the balance of inspiration. FGS control valve (400) may be re-opened any time from the beginning of expiration, as sensed by the reverse of pressure by the pressure sensing means (405), to just before<br>
 5      the next inspiration, also sensed by pressure changes in the breathing circuit Pop-off valve (425) prevents the FGS reservoir bag (20) from overfilling when FGS exceeds VE.<br>
Thus when FGSF is less than VB, the subject inhales FGS, then SGS, and no 10     contamination of SGS with FGS occurs.<br>
Use of Circuits for Ventilated Patients<br>
Any of the SGDB circuits disclosed herein as well as the Fisher circuit can. be used for<br>
a patient tinder controlled ventilation by enclosing the FGS reservoir (20) and<br>
15   exhaled gas reservoir (18) within a rigid container (21) with exit ports for the inspiratory limb of the circuit (24) and expiratory limb of the circuit (25) and port for attachment to a patient interface of a ventilator (22) as illustrated in Figure 4. In Figure 4, the inspiratory limb (500) represents the inspiratory limb of any of the SGDB circuits herein described, and expiratory limb (501) corresponds to the<br>
20    expiratory limb of any of the SGDB circuits herein described. The FGS reservoir bag (20) and expiratory gas reservoir bag (18) are enclosed in a rigid air-tight container such mat the inspiratory limb (500) enters the container via port (24) and expiratory limb (501) enters the container via port (25) such that the junctions of the outside of the limbs form an air-tight Beal with the inside surface of the ports. A further port<br>
25   (22) 1B provided for attachment of the Y piece of any ventilator (23). Detachment from the ventilator allows the circuit to be used with a spontaneously breathing patient During the inspiratory phase of the ventilator, the pressure inside the container (21) rises putting the contents of the FGS reservoir bag (20) and the expiratory gas reservoir bag (18) under the same pressure.   Since the opening<br>
30    pressure of the inspiratory valve is less than that of the bypass valve for circuits using passive bypass valves (for example those shown in Figures 2,3,5,5B, 5A, 3B, and 3D), the FGS reservoir (20) will be emptied preferentially.  "When the FGS<br>

reservoir (20) is empty, the pressure in the container (21) and inside the expiratory gas reservoir (18) will open the bypass valve (35,17, 206) and begin emptying exhaled gas reservoir (18) delivering SGS to the patient For circuits using an actively engaged control valve (400) in the inspiratory limb of the circuit a valve<br>
5    opening detection means (407) such as an electronic circuit that is broken by the opening of the valve when the valve is part of a closed electronic circuit, not shown, detects opening of the one way valve (35,17,206) in the exhalation bypass limb. The FGS control valve (400) is then dosed, directing FGS into the FGS reservoir bag until the collapse of the FGS reservoir during the next inspiratory phase.<br>
10<br>
During the exhalation phase of the ventilator, the ventilator's expiratory valve is opened and contents of the container (21) are opened to atmospheric pressure, allowing the patient to exhale into the expiratory gas reservoir (18) and the FGS to flow into the FGS reservoir bag (20). Thus, the FGS and SGS are inhaled sequentially<br>
15   during inhalation with controlled ventilation without mixing of FGS with SGS at any time.<br>
       Figure 4B shows the ventilator configuration described above as used with the preferred circuit shown in Figure 6A. This is the preferred embodiment for<br>
20     ventilated patients.<br>
          The primary difference between the standard anesthetic circle circuit of the prior art (Figure 12) and the circuits disclosed herein is that with the circuits disclosed herein, both a SGS reservoir (18) and a FGS reservoir (20) are in the rigid box. With the valve <br>
25     configurations disclosed herein, there will be sequential delivery of the FGS, men the SGS, when VB exceeds the FGSF. This does not occur with the standard anesthetic circle circuit even; if the CO* absorber is removed from the circuit<br>

,   Function of the circuit as an anesthetic circuit:<br>
5    For spontaneous ventilation, 3-way valve (210) is open between rigid container (216) and manual ventilation assembly consisting of ventilation bag (212) and APL valve (213). When the patient exhales, increased pressure in the circuit doses inspiratory valve (219) and bypass valve (206). Exhaled gas is directed into the exhalation limb (202), past one-way valve (203) into the expiratory reservoir bag (207). FGS enters via<br>
10    port (218) and fills the FGS reservoir (215). During inhalation, inhalation valve (219) opens and FGS from the FGS reservoir (215) and FGS port (218) enter the inspiratory limb (220) and are delivered to patient If FGSF is less than VB, the FGS reservoir (215) empties before the end of the breath; continued respiratory effort results in a further reduction ia. pressure in the circuit When the opening pressure of the bypass<br>
15   valve (206) is exceeded, it opens and gas from the expiratory gas reservoir (207) passes through the canister (204) into the rebreathing limb (221) and makes up the balance of the breath with SGS. The opening of bypass valve (206) is detected by valve opening sensing means (407) signals are sent to dose FGS control valve (400) by activating valve control means (403). When the FGS control valve (400) is dosed,<br>
20   any additional FGSF entering the circuit during the balance of inspiration is directed only to the FGS reservoir bag (215) and not to the patient When valve (400) is dosed patient receives only SGS for the balance of inspiration. FGS control valve (400) may be re-opened -any time from the beginning of expiration to just before the next inspiration. Phase of ventilation is sensed by sensor (407).<br>

For the purposes of functioning as an anesthetic delivery circuit,, part of the FGS entering the circuit would be the anesthetic vapor, for example Desflurane, and the canister (204) would contain CO2 absorbent material. The SGS passes through the canister (204) but still contains expired O2 and anesthetic, which can both be safely<br>
30    rebreathed by the patient In this respect, the circuit in Figure 7 functions like a circle anesthetic circuit in which the FGSF containing Q2 and anesthetic can be reduced to<br>

match the consumption or absorption by the patient However, by bypassing the canister (204), the circuit can be used for measuring cardiac output.<br>
        If the canister (204) is filled with hopcalite it can be used to remove carbon monoxide <br>
5     from the patient since the SGS still contains expired O2 and CO*. LE the caruster (204) is filled with zeolite it can. be used to remove volatile agents such as anesthetics from the patient<br>
Advantages of circuit over previous art<br>
10<br>
1. It is comparable to the circle anesthesia circuit with reaped: to efficiency of delivery of anesthesia, and ability to conduct anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation as well as controlled ventilation. <br>
2) It is often important to measure tidal volume and VE during anesthesia. With a<br>
15        circle circuit a pneumotach with attached tubing and cables must be placed at the patient interface, increasing the dead-space, bulk and clutter at the head of the patient With our circuit the pneumotach (or a spirometer if the patient is breaming spontaneously) can be placed at port (214) and thus; remote from the patient<br>
20 3) Sasano (Anesth Analg 2001; 93:1188-1191) taught a circuit that can be used to accelerate the elimination of anesthesia. However that circuit required additional devices such as an external source of gas (reserve gas), a demand regulator, self-inflating bag or other manual ventilating device, 3-way stopcock and additional tubing. Furthermore, Sasano did not disclose a. method whereby<br>
25	mechanical ventilation can be used. In fact it appears mat it cannot be used-<br>
patients must be ventilated by hand for that method. With the apparatus and method disclosed herein, there is no requirement for an additional external source of gas or demand regulator; 4) the patient can be ventilated with the ventilation bag (212) already on the circuit<br>
30	or the circuit ventilator, or any ventilator; no other tubing or devices are<br>
required.<br>

5) Circle circuits cannot deliver FGS and then SGS sequentially- Such control is required to make physiological measurements such as cardiac output during anesthesia.<br>
5 With the circuit of Figure 7, if the canister (204) is bypassed, the circuit becomes the equivalent of the one described in Figure 5 with the addition of the ventilator apparatus shown in Figure 4. With the circuit of Figure 7, box (216) could be opened to atmosphere instead of connected to a ventilator, and the circuit could be used with spontaneously breathing patients  for measuring cardiac output white<br>
10     modifying SGS.<br>
It should be recognized to those skilled in the art that various embodiments of the<br>
invention disclosed in this patent application are possible without departing from<br>
the scope including, but not limited to:<br>
15	a) using multiple inspiratory and expiratory limbs in combination provided<br>
that<br>
i)   the inspiratory and expiratory limbs are kept separate except at a single<br>
                     point prior to reaching the patient where they are joined<br>
                       ii) each limb has the corresponding valves as in the arrangement above, and<br>
20	iii) the valves have the same relative pressures so as to keep the inspired gas<br>
delivery sequential as discussed above.<br>
b)	using active valves, for example electronic, solenoid, or balloon valves,<br>
instead of passive valves, provided said valves are capable of occluding the<br>
limbs, and means is provided for triggering and controlling said active<br>
25	valves. The advantage of active valves is more precise control. The<br>
disadvantage is that they are more costly.<br>
c)	replacing reservoir bags with extended tubes or other means for holding<br>
gases<br>
d)	surrounding valves in exhalation limb and/or in the inspiratory limb of<br>
30	circuit with the exhaled gas reservoir causing them to be surrounded by<br>
warm exhaled air and prevent freezing and sticking of valves in cold environments.<br>

e) Changing the composition of FGS and SGS to change alveolar concentrations<br>
of gases other than CQ2, for example O2. By analogy to CQ2, with respect to<br>
Q2: alveolar PO2 is determined by FGS flow and the PQ2 of FGS. When PC*<br>
of SGS is the same as the PQ2 in the alveoli, inhaling SGS does not change<br>
5	flux of O2 in the alveoli. Therefore, those skilled in the art can arrange the<br>
partial pressure of component gases in FGS and SGS and the flows of FGS such that they can achieve any alveolar concentration of component gases independent, of VE as long as VB exceeds sufficiently flow of FGS.<br>
10    As many changes can be made to the various embodiments of the invention without departing from the scope thereof; it is intended that all matter contained herein be interpreted as illustrative of the invention but not in a limiting sense.<br>

To clarify the function of the automated cardiac output device, we will contrast it to<br>
a standard anaesthetic machine which has the same configuieation of listed<br>
components.<br>
20     1) The preferred SGDB circuits we describe differ from any anaesthetic circuit The<br>
SGDB circuit first provides the FGS, men the SGS.  This allows Are circuit to<br>
compensate for changes in CO2 elimination on any particular breath.   For<br>
example, during a small breath, the unused FGS remains in the FGS reservoir<br>
and is available to provide the exact additional V'A for each gas in the set when a<br>
25	larger breath is taken or frequency of breaming increases subsequently. As a<br>
result changes in "VCO2 can be instituted independent of breaming pattern. 2) Anesthetic machines do not automatically alter the fresh gas flows. Fresh gas flows are manually controlled by the anesthesiologist<br>
3), Anesthetic machines do not calculate VA and cannot calculate VCC*, and Q.<br>

4)	Anesthetic machines cannot generate the data required to make the calculations<br>
for Q and its associated parameters because the circuit is inappropriate and the<br>
gas flows are not configured to be controlled by a computer.<br>
5)	The flowmeters on commonly used anesthetic machines are too imprecise and<br>
5	inaccurate to perform these teste and calculations. There is no need for such<br>
precision and accuracy of flow for routine clinical anesthetic care.<br>
       9.0 Method of generating data required to make calculations of Q and related<br>
                physiologic parameters (see Figure 11):<br>
10	Cardiac Output can be measured in several ways according to the methods<br>

                         without first identifying VA by following the following steps:<br>
                   9.2.1.1 Calculate a preliminary minimum VA for the subject based on body<br>

identified by a less than a threshold change in PETCO2 over a<br>

                                   user defined according to the circumstances of the test and can be<br>
determined by those skilled in the art <br>

VA y is less than calculated preliminary minimum VA and not equal<br>
10	to VA *, for a time approximately equal to a recirculation time, about<br>

9.2.1.6 On a graph of PETCO2 vs PGS flow, plot the points (PsrCO2y, VAl)<br>
and (PETCOA VA X). Extrapolate the line formed by connecting these<br>
two point to intersect a horizontal line at PurCQ2- resting PBICQ2 .<br>
   The FGS flow at the intersection point is determined to be VA.<br>
20	   922      Progressive Reduction of FGS flow method of finding VA:<br>
922.1 Use FGS that preferably has no CO2<br>
                        9222 Wait for steady state as indicated by less man a threshold change in<br>
                                  PETCQ2 over a designated time period. The actual thresholds and<br>

25'	test and can be determined by those skilled in the art<br>
922.3 When in steady state, reduce FGS flow by a small fixed flow, for<br>
example 0.1 L/min, preferably at regular intervals of time or after<br>
each breath. Alternate flow reduction rates could be used, and the<br>
reduction need not be linear in time.<br>

in the FGS flow for a time approximately equal to one recirculation time. 9.2.25 After approximately one recirculation time, usually about 30 8, raise<br>
FGS flow above resting VB .  A relation of PHICQI VS PGS flow is<br>
5	calculated and two lines of best fit are calculated/ one for the set of<br>
steady state PmCOz values, and one for the set of raised PEICQZ<br>
values above the mean of the steady state values.  The FGS flow<br>
corresponding to the intersection of said lines corresponds to ™.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates that progressive reduction of SGF (labelled<br>
10	"FGF' in tine figure) results in a distinct inflection point when either<br>
PETCQ2 or PETO2 is graphed as a function of SGF. We define the SGF corresponding to this inflection point as equal to VA.<br>
922.6 These two methods of finding YA are physiologically equivalent and<br>
15	one may have some advantages over the other in particular clinical<br>
                                      or research circumstances.    The Progressive Reduction method<br>
                                     should be contrasted with the method for calculating VA taught by<br>
                                      Preiss et al (Canadian Patent Application 2346517). In that method,<br>
                                      while fresh gas flow into a sequential gas delivery circuit was<br>
20	reduced stepwise, after each reduction, the subject was observed for<br>
several breaths looking for an exponential rise in PETCO2. The Preiss method requires continued breathing at each fresh gas flow looking for development of a new steady when fresh gas flow falls below<br>
                                     VA.   This process is very time consuming and is unlikely to be<br>
25	tolerated by most patients. If, in the attempt to shorten the time for<br>
                                    finding the fresh gas flow below VA the fresh gas flow reduction are<br>
                                     large, resolution of critical fresh gas flow is lost   If the steps are<br>
                                    small, when the fresh gas flow is just barely less than VA, it will be<br>
                                    difficult to discern the small rise in PETCQ2 from the normal<br>
30	variation in PETCO2. The progressive breath-by-breath reduction in<br>
                                     FGS flow disclosed herein results in a rapid linear rise in PETCQ2<br>

20<br>
Difference between this method and previous methods to perform the differential Pick:<br>
(a)	With the new method, the decrease in VCO2 is performed by<br>
reducing the FGF to a SGDB circuit as opposed to insertion of a<br>
25	deadspace at the patient-circuit interface.    As a result, if the<br>
                                        subject increases his breathing rate or breath size, there is no<br>
change in VCO2 and the calculations via the differential Pick equation are not affected.<br>
(b)	The VCO2 is known using the VA (identified by one of the new<br>
30	or the previously disclosed method) and the PBTCQ2. two robust<br>

independently derived values in the same subject In the previous art, this gradient is calculated from empirical formulae derived from averaged values and do not necessarily apply to the subject<br>
Therefore our method provides more accurate values for VCO2, V<br>

Our method of performing the Kim Rahn Farhi is an improvement over the previous art in that<br>
                              (a) Test is performed simultaneously with a test for differential Pick<br>

art, the VCOi, calculation cannot be done during a breath hold or<br>
simulated breath hold by rebreathing.<br>
                                (c) VCOi, measurement does not require a pneumotachymeter<br>
