BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to digital <br>
10    communication systems. More particularly, and not by way of limitation, the invention is directed to an Ethernet Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) and method providing dynamic service selection and end-user configuration of service bindings.<br>

Description of Related Art<br>
Ethernet is a packet-based transmission protocol that is primarily used in local area networks (LANs).  Ethernet<br>
20    is the common name for the IEEE 802.3 industry specification. Data is transmitted in Ethernet frames. Each frame includes a preamble with 64 bits utilized for synchronization. A Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD), a destination address,  a source address,  and a length/type<br>
25     identifier follow the preamble.  Media Access Control (MAC) client data, together with a Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD) may vary in length from 46 to 1500 bytes (octets).  A Frame Check Sequence (FCS) adds four more octets.  The frame size is counted from the destination address to the FCS,<br>
30    inclusive, and thus may vary between 64 and 1518 octets, not including a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) tag, which adds 4 octets.<br>
When establishing a data session between -an end-user device and a service provider, a service binding creates a<br>
35     logical connection between the end-user device and a service<br><br>
WO 2005/060208	3	PCT/SE2OO3/0O1982<br>
provided by some form of service provider, for example, a Network Service Provider or Application Service Provider. Two types of service bindings currently in use in the industry are referred to herein as the basic service binding <br>
5   and the advanced service binding. The basic service binding is established in an Ethernet DSLAM between a VLAN within the Access Domain and an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) on the local DSL loop. The advanced service binding is created in a Broadband Remote<br>
10   Access Server (BRAS) between the IP client and the service. The basic service binding may also be combined with the BRAS-based advanced service binding.<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram illustrating a basic service binding.  The IEEE has developed a standard<br>
15  for Ethernet access control, IBEE802.1x. Originally this standard was intended for switched Ethernet networks, but during the standardization process it was adapted to be used for wireless LANs (IBEE802.il). However, the basic principles are still considered applicable for controlling<br>
20   access to switched Ethernet. IEEE802.1x is an integrated part of the Windows XP operating system. Future versions of other operating systems may also include the feature, making this a commonly accepted login interface.<br>
A basic service binding is created by assigning an<br>
25  IEEE802.1Q VLAN ID of a Service VLAN (S-VLAN) 11a, lib to a subscriber line PVC 12a, 12b. An IEEE802.1p priority value is also associated with this binding, and is used to ensure Quality of Service (QpS) within the Access Domain 13. The Ethernet DSLAM 14 tags upstream traffic, from the Customer<br>
30   Premises Equipment (CPE) /Network Terminal (NT) 15 to the S-VLAN, with the assigned VLAN ID and priority value before forwarding the traffic upstream. Downstream Ethernet traffic, from the S-VLAN to the CPE/NT is mapped by the Ethernet DSLAM to the correct PVC by inspecting the VLAN ID,<br><br>
WO 2005/060208	//	PCT/SE2W3/001982<br><br>
802.lp priority, and destination MAC address. Each subscriber line may have multiple PVCs corresponding to different services.<br>
FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram illustrating an <br>
5   advanced service binding. Services 16, 17 connect through a BRAS 18 to an access domain 19 and the Ethernet DSLAM 14, which connects through a local loop 21 to the CPE/NT 15. The service bindings made in a BRAS are often based on the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) as the access protocol.  With<br>
10  this protocol, a session is initiated from the end-user device (CPE/NT) towards the BRAS. During this session establishment, the service binding is created, typically based on the login credentials supplied by the end-user's CPE/NT.<br>
15   FIG. 3 is a simplified block diagram illustrating a basic service binding combined with the BRAS-based advanced service binding. The basic service binding portion is again created by assigning an IEEE802.1Q VLAN ID of an S-VLAN 11a, lib to a  subscriber line PVC 12a,  12b.    An IEEE802.1p<br>
20   priority value is also associated with this binding, and is used to ensure QoS within the access domain 13. The Ethernet DSLAM 14 tags upstream traffic, from the CPE/NT 15 to the S-VLAN, with the assigned VLAN ID and priority value before forwarding  the  traffic  upstream.    Downstream  Ethernet<br>
25   traffic from the S-VLAN to the CPE/NT is mapped by the Ethernet DSLAM to the correct PVC by inspecting the VLAN ID, 802.lp  priority,   and  destination  MAC  address.  Each subscriber line may have multiple PVCs corresponding to different services.   The advanced service binding portion<br>
30  includes BRASS 18a, 18b which connect respective S-VLANs 11a, lib to services 22-25.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are problems, however, with the basic, advanced, and  consequently,  the combined  service  bindings.    The problems with the basic service binding method are  as <br>
5   follows:<br>
• Inflexible mapping: A limitation with the VLAN-per-Service method is that end-users are semi-statically allocated to specific services. The FVC-VLAN mapping and other service characteristics (e.g., connection bandwidth)<br>
10  performed by the Ethernet DSLAM are controlled by the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) system, and only the O&amp;M system can change these service bindings. The change of service can be made manually by the O&amp;M operator, or by using the northbound interface of the O&amp;M system.  In the<br>
15  latter case, the end-user may be able to change the service binding on-line via a web-based service selection server that interfaces with the O&amp;M system. The problem with tbat solution is that it assumes a connection exists to the server in order to perform the service selection,  and<br>
20  furthermore it assumes that all end-user devices have an interface for displaying service options and selecting the desired service.<br>
- Low access granularity: Any end-user device connected to a specific PVC will be associated with the corresponding<br>
25  S-VLAN. However, it may be useful to be able to map different devices towards different services, although the devices share the same PVC, for example if only a single PVC is supported by the CPE modem (a very common situation today).<br>
30  -No access authentication: Virtually any device attached to a PVC is granted access to the corresponding S-VLAN. However, it is desirable to be able to validate end-user devices individually.<br><br>
WO 2IM&gt;5rt&gt;60208<br><br>
6<br><br>
PCT/SE2W3/001982<br><br>
•	Not future proof: The future standard for Ethernet<br>
access (EFMO seems to be moving away from ATM (i.e., the<br>
PVC-based service mapping cannot be used anymore, and an<br>
alternative approach is necessary).<br>
5  The main problem with the advanced (BRAS-based) service binding method is that it is a centralized approach with all access intelligence collected in one node, and with all traffic streams going though this node. This means that:<br>
•	Single point of failure: The BRAS is a single point<br>
10  of failure, typically affecting thousands of end-users in<br>
case of a node failure.<br>
Poor downward scalability: Even in a minimum configuration, a BRAS typically does not represent an economically reasonable access   solution for small groups of<br>
15   end-users.  The cost per end-user is simply too high.<br>
- Poor upward scalability: As end-users put higher and higher load on their broadband access connections, the performance requirements of the BRAS will increase dramatically to a level for which they are not designed.<br>
20  -Inefficient multicast support: A centralized approach using PPP as the access protocol does not efficiently support multicast. Other problems pertaining to PPP inclixde protocol overhead, and difficulties in mapping quality-of-service indicators between different protocol layers.<br>
25   Thus there is a particular need for an Ethernet DSLAM and service binding method that overcome the problems of the prior art. The present invention provides such a DSLAM and method.<br>
The  present  invention  is  designed  to  combine<br>
30  advantageous elements of each of the existing service binding methods. The invention dynamically creates the service binding in the Ethernet DSLAM based on a service selection made by the end-user. Thus, the traditional BRAS is not required to create the dynamic service binding.  The<br><br>
WO 2005/060208		PCT/SE 2003/001982<br>
end-user may use the PPPoE or IEEE802.1X access protocols to provide login credentials indicating the desired service. The login credentials are validated towards a RADIUS server, and this server configures the Ethernet DSLAM with the<br>
 5      attributes of the service binding.<br>
One of these attributes is the local loop PVC to carry the desired service. The Ethernet DSLAM uses this PVC for downstream traffic for the corresponding service binding(s) and thereby "trains" a learning bridge CPE NT with multiple <br>
10    PVCs so that this modem will use the correct PVC for    upstream traffic.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the invention is directed to an Ethernet DSLAM for providing dynamic service selection and end-user configuration of service bindings in a digitalis   communication system.  The Ethernet DSLAM includes means for receiving login credentials and a service request from an end-user  device;  means  for  authenticating  the  login credentials through an authentication server; and means for     receiving from the authentication server,  a plurality of <br>
20     attributes for configuring the Ethernet DSLAM to provide           a service binding corresponding to the requested service.  The                         attributes including an identification of an access network for the requested service,  and an identification of a   Permanent  Virtual  Circuit  (PVC)  on  a  local  DSL  loop <br>
25   associated with the end-user device.   The Ethernet DSLAM also includes means for training a bridging network terminal (NT) having a plurality of PVCs to utilize the identified PVC for sending upstream traffic from the end-user terminal to the Ethernet DSLAM.   The training means includes means <br>
30    for sending initial downstream traffic from the Ethernet DSLAM to the end-user device utilizing the identified PVC.<br>
In another aspect, the invention is directed to an Ethernet DSLAM that includes a plurality of subscriber ports for receiving login credentials and service requests from<br><br><br>
WO 2005/060208								PCT/SE 2003/001982<br>
end-user devices, and for communicating data traffic to and<br>
from the end-user devices.   An identified subscriber port<br>
communicates  with an  identified  end-user  device.    The<br>
Ethernet DSLAM also includes a traffic mapper that maps data<br>
5    traffic between a plurality of Service Virtual Local Area<br>
Networks  (S-VLANs) and the subscriber ports.   A RADIUS<br>
client in the DSLAM sends login credentials and a service<br>
request received from the identified end-user device to an<br>
external RADIUS server for authentication and receives from<br>
10   the external RADIUS server, a plurality of attributes for configuring the Ethernet DSLAM to provide a service binding corresponding to the requested service. The attributes include an identification of an S-VLAN through which the requested service is accessed, and an identification of a<br>
15   PVC on a local DSL loop associated with the end-user device. A Service Selection Controller in the DSLAM receives the attributes from the RADIUS client and sends mapping control information to the traffic mapper, thereby enabling the traffic mapper to establish a service binding between the<br>
20   identified end-user device and the S-VLAN through which the requested service is accessed.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of providing dynamic service selection and end-user configuration of service bindings in a digital communication<br>
25  system. The method includes the steps of sending login credentials and a service request from an end-user device to an Ethernet DSLAM; sending the login credentials and service request from the Ethernet DSLAM to an authentication server; and sending from the authentication server to the Ethernet<br>
30  DSLAM, a plurality of service binding attributes. The attributes include an identification of an access network for the requested service, and an identification of a PVC on a local DSL loop associated with the end-user device. The Ethernet DSLAM utilizes the service binding attributes to<br><br>
WO 2005/060208							PCT/SE 2003/001982<br>
configure a service binding corresponding to the requested 5-Service. "'-^Initial downstream traffic is sent from the Ethernet DSLAM to the end-user device utilizing the identified PVC, thereby training a bridging NT having a<br>
 5   plurality of PVCs to utilize the identified PVC for sending upstream traffic from the end-user terminal to the Ethernet DSLAM.<br>
In still yet another aspect, the invention is directed  to a method of providing dynamic service selection and end-<br>
10 user configuration of service bindings in a digital communication system. The method includes the steps of configuring in an Ethernet DSLAM, a plurality of subscriber ports for communicating with a plurality of end-user devices; receiving login credentials and a service request<br>
15  from an identified end-user device utilizing an identified subscriber port; and sending the login credentials and the service request from a RADIUS client in the Ethernet DSLAM to an external RADIUS server for authentication. This is followed by receiving from the external RADIUS server, a<br>
20   plurality of attributes for a service binding corresponding to the requested service. The attributes include an identification of an S-VLAN through which the requested service is accessed, and an identification of a PVC on a local DSL loop associated with the end-user device.  This is<br>
25  followed by configuring the Ethernet DSLAM to provide the service binding corresponding to the requested service; and mapping data traffic by the Ethernet DSLAM between the S-VLAN through which the requested service is accessed and the identified subscriber port communicating with the identified<br>
30   end-user device.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular embodiments, circuits, signal <br>
5    formats etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details.<br>
The present invention may provide two types of service bindings, MAC granularity and VLAN granularity. MAC granularity service bindings are made between service-VLANs<br>
15  and end-user devices with MAC addresses visible to the Ethernet DSLAM. VLAN granularity service bindings are made between service-VLANs and end-user VLANs visible to the Ethernet DSLAM. Thus, the end-user must use an Ethernet bridging network terminal (NT) to enable bindings of either<br>
20  type. If the end-user uses a routing NT, only the MAC address of this NT is visible to the Ethernet DSLAM, and the end-user VLANs are not visible through the router. Thus only a single service binding can be established, common for all devices behind the routing NT.<br>
25   The following description will initially describe the invention using the MAC granularity type of service bindings. However, most of this description is also applicable to the VLAN granularity solution based on end-user VLANs.  Specific issues pertaining to service bindings<br>
30   based on end-user VLANs are then discussed.<br>
FIG. 4 is a simplified block diagram illustrating service bindings between end-user devices 3la-31c having MAC addresses MAC-1, MAC-2, and MAC-3, respectively, and service-VLANS  11a,   lib  in  accordance  with  the  MAC<br>
35  granularity embodiment of the present invention. An Ethernet bridging NT 32 enables S-VLAN/MAC address bindings.<br><br>
WO 2005/060208		PCT/SE 2003/001982<br>
An Ethernet DSLAM 33 includes a mapping function 34, which maps S-VLANs to MAC addresses, and vice versa. The mapping function may be implemented in the Ethernet DSLAM as a new software-based function, referred to herein as a Service <br>
5    Selection Handler (SSH) 34.<br>
FIG. 5 is a functional block diagram illustrating the Service Selection Handler (SSH) 34 and its context in the Ethernet DSLAM 33. The primary task of the SSH is to create service bindings between end-user  device MAC addresses<br>
10  (represented by subscriber ports 35) and the S-VLANs lla, lib. To do this, the SSH implements a RADIUS client function 36, similar to the functionality of a BRAS. The RADIUS client interacts with a remotely located RADIUS server 40, either directly or through a local proxy RADIUS<br>
15  server 37. The local RADIUS server sends traffic via a RADIUS VLAN 38 in the Access Domain to a Traffic Mapping function 42 in the Ethernet DSLAM 33. The SSH also includes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server 39 and a Service Selection Controller 41, which sends mapping control<br>
20  instructions to the Traffic Mapping function 42 for mapping traffic to the various subscriber ports 35.<br>
Several different ways of creating a service binding in the Ethernet DSLAM are possible: IEEE802.1x, PPPoE, HTTP/web interface, and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)<br>
25  option-90. For all methods, the service may implicitly be selected based on the login credentials provided by the end-user device. In the MAC granularity embodiment, it is chosen to focus on IEEE802.1x and PPPoE.<br>
When using either IEEE802.1X or PPPoE, the SSH 34<br>
30      receives the login credentials from the end-user device 31a-31c, and validates the credentials against the remotely located RADIUS server 40. This may be done via the proxy RADIUS server 37. The RADIUS server (or the proxy) also informs the SSH about the S-VLAN ID corresponding to the<br><br>
WO 2005/
credentials. The SSH then enables upstream traffic from the device's MAC address to the appointed S-VLAN, and vice versa for downstream traffic.<br>
  By using different login credentials, the end-user is <br>
5  thereby able to select a preferred service. Similar to a traditional BRAS, the domain portion of the username may be used as the selection criteria. For example, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1d7772785d746e6d71337e7270">[email&#160;protected]</a> and <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="670d0802270e1417554904080a">[email&#160;protected]</a> are usernames that may be utilized for accessing two different Internet Service Providers (ISPs).<br>
10  FIG. 6 is a functional block diagram illustrating functional roles when utilizing the IEEE802.1X method of creating a service binding in the Ethernet DSLAM 33. There are three major entities involved in the IEKE802.1x structure, a Supplicant 45, an Authenticator 46,  and an<br>
15  Authentication Server 47. The Supplicant is an entity requesting access to a service. The Authenticator is an entity that enforces authentication before allowing access to the requested service. The Authentication Server is an entity that  performs  the actual  authentication  of  the<br>
20  Supplicant on behalf of the Authenticator. For Ethernet DSL Access, the Supplicant is the end-user device, the Authenticator is the Ethernet DSLAM 33, and the Authentication Server is the RADIUS server 40. Protocol stacks for the Supplicant and Authenticator are illustrated<br>
25   at the bottom of FIG. 6.<br>
IEEE802.1x adopts the Extensible Authentication Protocol (BAP) 48 as the mechanism for exchange of authentication messages. Between the Supplicant 45 and the Authenticator 46, EAP messages are encapsulated in Ethernet<br>
30   frames using the EAP over LAN (EAPOL) protocol 49. EAP is also a fundament for PPP access, and is described in RFC2284.<br>
To initiate a session, the Supplicant 45 sends a Start-message to the Authenticator 46, using a multicast address<br><br>
WO 2005/060208		PCT/SE 2003/001982<br>
defined by the 802.lx standard. The Authenticator requests the Supplicant to send the login credentials, and relays the Supplicant's response towards the Authentication Server 47. The Authentication Server and the Supplicant can then <br>
5  exchange further login information directly, with the Authenticator merely relaying information. If the login procedure ends successfully, the Authenticator enables the MAC address corresponding to the Supplicant, and creates a service binding 51 towards the S-VLAN 11 pointed out by the<br>
10   Authentication Server.<br>
The end-user device 31a-31c is then able to access an S-VLAN lla, lib, and can issue a DHCP request towards a DHCP server 52 located within that S-VLAN in order to obtain an IP configuration.   However,  the device may already have<br>
15  issued several DHCP requests (for example, as a part of its initialization phase), but without being able to access any S-VLAN and thus no DHCP server. In order to keep the DHCP client "alive and agile* until the service binding is established, the Ethernet DSLAM 33 answers the DHCP requests<br>
20  with a temporary configuration and a very short lease time, encouraging the end-user device to renew its IP address in a short period of time, for example, within a few seconds. The DHCP request following a service binding creation will not be acknowledged by the local DHCP server 39 (FIG. 5),<br>
25  thus revoking the temporarily address and forcing the client (end-user device) to broadcast a DHCP discover message. This time, the DHCP traffic is not intercepted by the local DHCP server 39, but instead passes on to the S-VLAN 11 where the "real" DHCP server 52 answers.  It should be noted that<br>
30   in new and future DHCP clients, a DHCP ForceRenew message may be utilized by the local DHCP server to make the DHCP client perform an immediate DHCP renewal instead of waiting for lease timeout. The ForceRenew feature is described in RFC3203.<br><br>

An alternative method of providing login credentials is to Utilize PPPoE. As previously discussed, PPPoE has Some severe drawbacks, but the present invention does not suffer from these drawbacks because the invention only uses PPPoE <br>
5   between the end-user device 3 la-31c and the Ethernet DSLAM 33, and only for establishing and terminating sessions. End-user payload traffic is conveyed without PPPoE as IP directly over Ethernet.<br>
FIG. 7 is a protocol stack of an end-user device 31<br>
10  using PPPoE for service selection. To create a service binding, the end-user device broadcasts a PPPoE initiation message 55 toward the Ethernet DSLAM 33. The SSH 34 in the Ethernet DSLAM terminates this message and establishes a PPPoE "connection", using the device MAC address.  Via the<br>
15  PPPoE connection (right side of PIG. 7 including the PPPoE Session Client 56 and underlying PPPoE protocol stack 57), the user submits login credentials and is validated against the RADIOS server 40 (FIG. 5) . If there is a successful validation,  the SSH enables Ethernet traffic between the<br>
20   PPPoE connection's MAC address and the appointed S-VLAN 11. Then, as with the IEEE802.1x method, the IP stack of the device (left side of FIG. 7 including Applications 58 and underlying IP protocol stack 59) can issue a DHCP request towards the S-VLAN 11, and obtain IP configuration from a<br>
25    DHCP server 52.<br>
Note specifically that the end-user device 31 does not send any IP traffic via its PPPoE interface. Therefore, this interface is configured with a non-routable IP address (e.g.  in the 169.254.0.0/16 network)  during the service<br>
30  binding. This service selection method may be limited to utilization with end-user PCs, since it requires the dual stack" functionality depicted in FIG. 7. Note also, that PPP also uses the EAP protocol for authentication, giving an access functionality of the IP-DSLAM almost identical with<br><br>

The following steps are taken to configure the Ethernet <br>
5   DSLAM 33 with the response from the RADIUS server 37. The Access Network Provider defines services with a name, a S-VLAN, a Class of Service (CoS) value (Ethernet priority), and the Access Service Provider (s) who are allowed to use this service in their offerings to end-users. The Access <br>
10  Service Provider assigns services to end-users, and may customize these services to fit individual end-users. The customization includes PVC settings, bandwidth settings, and filter settings.<br>
The RADIUS client 36 in the Ethernet DSLAM 33 requests <br>
15  validation of an end-user by issuing a dataset of {end-user ID, username, password} towards the Local RADIUS Server 37. There is one Local RADIUS server per access domain, but the Local RADIUS Server may interface with remotely located RADIUS servers 40 belonging to various service providers.<br>
20  For each service the end-user is allowed to access, the Access Service Provider has already registered a number of service attributes, such as:<br>
Service name;<br>
Domain name used by the end-user to point out the 25   requested service;<br>
Virtual  Path  Identifier/Virtual  Circuit  Identifier (VPl/VCI) values for the PVC used for this service;<br>
Bandwidth for the PVC used for this service;<br>
Filter settings;<br><br>
WO 2005/060208					PCT/SE 2003/001982<br>
MAC granularity/VLAN granularity;<br>
Service duration;	<br>
Charging information;<br>
Authentication;<br>
Password (in case of local authentication done by the Access Service Provider); and/or<br>
Remote RADIUS Server IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in case of authentication against a remote RADIUS server. <br>
10    Upon successful validation, the relevant service attributes are sent from the local RADIUS server 37 to the Ethernet DSLAM 33 for establishing the service binding.<br>
The  present  invention  thus  provides  an  Ethernet<br>
	bridging DSLAM 33 with BRAS functionality.  With the present<br>
15    invention, no central BRAS is required, thus solving the<br>
	disadvantages of this node and eliminating the cost for this<br>
	node.  Instead, a BRAS solution is created that is scalable<br>
	both  upwards  and  downwards,   efficiently  supporting<br>
multicast,  and with little end-user impact in case of<br>
failure (compared to failure of a centralized BRAS) .  A true<br>
	multi-service  scenario   (including  multiple  PVCs)   is<br>
	supported with a simple CPE NT that needs no configuration<br>
	by the end-user.   Additionally, the access methods (PPPoE<br>
	and IEEE802.1X) are equivalent to today's methods, so for<br>
  end-users the implementation is familiar.<br>
Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it is understood that the invention is not limited to the <br>
30   embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications, and substitutions without departing from the scope of the invention. The specification contemplates any all modifications that fall<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
An Ethernet Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer, DSLAM, (33) and method of dynamically creating a service binding in the Ethernet DSLAM based on a service selection made by an end-user (31). The end-user may use the PPPoE or IEEE802.1X access protocols to provide login credentials indicating the desired service. The login credentials are validated towards a RADIUS server (40), and this server configures the Ethernet DSLAM (33) with the attributes of the service binding, including an identified Permanent Virtual Circuit, PVC, (12) to carry the desired service. The Ethernet DSLAM may map service-VLANs to user MAC addresses (34), or may map service-VLANs to user-VLANs (62) to establish the service binding. The Ethernet DSLAM uses the identified PVC for downstream traffic for the corresponding service binding and thereby trains' a learning bridge network terminal to use the correct PVC for upstream traffic.<br></mh></a></mh></td>
