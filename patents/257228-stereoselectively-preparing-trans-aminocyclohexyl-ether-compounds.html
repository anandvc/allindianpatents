				<td>SYNTHETIC PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION OF AMINOCYCLOHEXYL ETHER COMPOUNDS<br>
Dross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/748,248 filed December 7, 2005 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/690,989 filed June 15, 2005.   These provisional applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention is generally directed toward a method for the stereoselective preparation of aminocyclohexyl ether compounds such as trans-(1R,2R)-aminocyclohexyl ether compounds and/or trans-(1S,2S)-aminocyclohexyl ether compounds as well as various intermediates, substrates and stereoisomers involved.  In addition, the present invention is directed toward a method for the stereoselective preparation of aminocyclohexyl ether compounds such as cis-('lR,2S)-aminocyclohexyl ether compounds and/or cis-(1S,2R)-aminocyciohexyl ether compounds The compounds prepared by methods of the present invention are useful for treating medical conditions or disorders, including for example, cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial arrhythmia and ventricular arrhythmia.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Arrhythmia is a variation from the normal rhythm of the heart beat and generally represents the end product of abnormal ion-channel structure, number or function. Both atrial arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias are known. The major cause of fatalities resulting from cardiac arrhythmias is the subtype of ventricular arrhythmias known as ventricular fibrillation (VF). Conservative estimates indicate mat, in the U.S. alone, each year over one million Americans will have a new or recurrent coronary attack (defined as myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease). About 650,000 of these individuals will be first heart attacks and 450,000 of these will be recurrent attacks. About one-third of the people experiencing these attacks will die as a result. At least 250,000 individuals a year die of coronary heart disease within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms and before they reach adequate medical aid. These are sudden deaths caused by cardiac arrest, usually resulting from ventricular fibrillation.<br>
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia seen in clinical practice<br>
and is a cause of morbidity in many individuals (Pritchett fc.L, N. Engl. J. Med. 327(14): 1031 Oct. 1, 1992, discussion 1031-2; Kannel and Wolf, Am. Heart J. 123(1 ):264-7 Jan. 1992).  Its prevalence is likely to increase as the population ages and it is estimated that 3-5% of patients over the age of 60 years have AF (Kannel W.B., Abbot R.D., Savage D.D., McNamara P.M., N. Engl. J. Med. 306(17):1018-22, 1982; Wolf P.A., Abbot R.D., Kannel W.B. Stroke. 22(8):983-8, 1991). While AF is rarely fatal, it can impair cardiac function and is a major cause of stroke (Hinton R.C., Kistler J.P., Fallon J.T., Friedlich A.L., Fisher C.M., American Journal of Cardiology 40(4):509-13, 1977; Wolf P.A., Abbot R.D., Kannel W.B., Archives of Internal Medicine 147(9):1561-4, 1987; Wolf P.A., Abbot R.D., Kannel W.B. Stroke. 22(8):983-8, 1991; Cabin H.S., Clubb K.S., Hall C., Perlmutter R.A., Feinstein A.R., American Journal of Cardiology 65(16):1112-6, 1990).<br>
PCT Published Patent Applications WO 99/50225 and WO 2004/099137 and U.S. Patent No. 7,057,053 disclose aminocyclohexylether compounds as being useful in the treatment of arrhythmias. Some of the compounds disclosed therein have been found to be particularly effective in the treatment and/or prevention of AF.  However, the synthetic methods described in these patent applications and patent and elsewhere were non-stereoselective and led to mixture of stereoisomers. As active pharmaceutical compounds, it is often desirable that drug molecules are in stereoisomerically substantially pure form. It may not be feasible or cost effective if the correct stereoisorner has to be isolated from a mixture of stereoisomers after a multi-step synthesis. Therefore, there remains a need in the art to develop method for the preparation of stereoisomerically substantially pure trans-aminocyclohexyl ether compounds.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As noted above, the present invention is directed to methods of stereoselectively making compounds of formula (I) and formula (II), as set forth above in the Summary of the Invention.<br>
An understanding of the present invention may be aided by reference to the following definitions and explanation of conventions used herein:<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have an ether oxygen atom at position 1 of a cyclohexane ring, and an amine nitrogen atom at position 2 of the cyclohexane ring, with other positions numbered in corresponding order as shown below in Structure (A):<br>
(Stucture  Removed)<br>
The bonds from the cyclohexane ring to the 1-oxygen and 2-nitrogen atoms in the above formula are disposed in the trans relationship. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the amine and ether substituents of the cyclohexane ring is (R.R)-frans or (S,S)-trans for the frans-stereoisomers of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Following the standard chemical literature description practice and as used in this specification, a solid full bond, as illustrated above in Structure (A) and a dashed full bond, as illustrated above in Structure (A), means that the substituents, in this case the amine and ether substituents, are in a frans-configuration with respect to the plane of the cyclohexane ring.<br>
Following the standard chemical literature description practice and as used in this specification, a full wedge bond, as illustrated below in Structure (Aa), means that the substituent bonded to the cyclohexane ring by this bond, in this case the ether substituent, is above the cyclohexane ring plane as illustrated on the page in a two dimensional representation, and a dashed wedge bond, as [Illustrated below in Structure (Aa), means that the substituent bonded to the cyclohexane ring by this bond, in this case the amine substituent, is below the cyclohexane ring plane as shown on the page in a two dimensional representation;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compounds of formula (II) have an ether oxygen atom at position 1 of a cyclohexane ring, and an amine nitrogen atom at position 2 of the cyclohexane ring, with other positions numbered in corresponding order as shown below in Structure (B):<br>
(Structure  Removed)<br>
The bonds from the cyclohexane ring to the 1-oxygen and 2-nitrogen atoms in the above formula are disposed in the cis retationship. Therefore, the stereochemistry of the amine and ether substituents of the cydohexane ring is (R,S)-cis or (S,R)-cis for the c/'s-stereoisomers of the compounds of formula (II).<br>
Following the standard chemical literature description practice and as used in this specification, two solid full bonds, as illustrated above in Structure (B) means that the substituents, in this case the amine and ether substituents, are in a cis-configuration with respect to the plane of the cyclohexane ring.<br>
Following the standard chemical literature description practice and as used in this specification, a full wedge bond, as illustrated below in Structure (Ba), means that the substituent bonded to the cyclohexane ring by this bond, in this case the ether and the amine substituent, is above the cyclohexsne ring plane as illustrated on the page in a two dimensional representation, and a dashed wedge bond, as [Illustrated below in Structure (Bb), means that the substituent bonded to the cyclohexane ring by this bond, in this case the ether and the amine substituent, is below the cyclohexane ring plane as shown on the page in a two dimensional representation;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Following the standard chemical literature description practice and as used in this specification, a wavy bond, as illustrated below in the compound of formula (2a2),<br>
indicates that the substituent, in this case the -OR substituent, is either below the plane of the cyclohexane ring or above the plane of the cyclohexane ring:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the formulae depicted herein, a bond to a substituent and/or a bond that links a molecular fragment to the remainder of a compound may be shown as intersecting one or more bonds in a ring structure. This indicates that the bond may be attached to any one of the atoms that constitutes the ring structure, so long as a hydrogen atom could otherwise be present at that atom. Where no particular substituent(s) is identified for a particular position in a structure, then hydrogen(s) is present at that position. For example, compounds of formula (I) contain the group (C):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where the group (C) is intended to encompass groups wherein any ring atom that could otherwise be substituted with hydrogen, may instead be substituted with eilher R3, R4 or R5, with the proviso that each of R3, R'1 and R5 appears once and only once on the ring. Ring atoms that are not substituted with any of R3, R'1 or Rb are substituted with hydrogen.<br>
The compounds of the present invention contain at least two asymmetric carbon atoms and thus exist as enantiomers and diastereoisomers. For the present invention, the words diastereomer and diastereoisomer and related terms are equivalent and interchangeable. Unless otherwise indicated, the present invention includes ail enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric forms of the aminocyclohexyl ether compounds of formula (I) and compounds of formula (II). Pure stereoisomers, mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereoisomers, and mixtures of different compounds of the invention are inciuded within the present invention. Thus, compounds of formula (I) and compounds of formula (II) may occur as racemates, racemic or diastereoisomeric mixtures and as individual diastereoisomers, or enantiomers, unless a specific stereoisomer enantiomer or diastereoisomer is identified, with all isomeric forms being included in the present invention. For the present invention, a racemate,<br>
diastereoisomeric or racemic mixture does not imply a 50:50 mixture of stereoisomers only. Other enantiomerically or diastereomerically enriched mixtures of varying ratios of stereoisomers are also contemplated. Unless otherwise noted, the phrase "stereoisomerically substantially pure" generally refers to those asymmetric carbon atoms that are described or illustrated in the structural formulae for that compound.<br>
The definition of stereoisomeric purity (or optical purity or chiral purity) and related terminology and their methods of determination (e.g., Optical rotation, circular dichroism etc.) are well known in the art (see e.g., E.L Eliel and S.H. Wilen, in Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, 1994; and references cited therein). The phrase "stereoisomerically substantially pure" generally refers to the enrichment of one of the stereoisomers (e.g., enantiomers or diastereoisomers) over the other stereoisomers in a sample, leading to chiral enrichment and increase in optical rotation activity of the sample.  Enantiomer is one of a pair of molecular species that are mirror images of each other and not superimposable. They are "mirror-image" stereoisomers.  Diastoreoisomers generally refer to stereoisomers not related as mirror-images. Enantiomeric excess (ee) and diastereoisomeric excess (de) are terms generally used to refer the stereoisorneric purity (or optical purity or chiral purity) of a sample of the compound of interest. Their definition and methods of determination are well known in the art and can be found e.g., in E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, in Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1994; and references cited therein. "Stereoselectively making" refers to preparing the compound having enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de).<br>
For the present invention, enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de) in the range of about 50% to about 100% is contemplated. A preferred range of enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de) is about 60% to about 100%. Another preferred range of enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de) is about 70% to about 100%. A more preferred range of enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de) is about 80% to about 100%. Another more preferred range of enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de) is about 85% to about 100%. An even more preferred range of enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de) is about 90% to about 100%. Another even more preferred range of enantiomeric excess (ee) or diastereoisomeric excess (de) is about 95% to about 100%. It is understood that the phrase "about 50% to about 100%" includes but is not limited to all the possible<br>
percentage numbers and fractions of a number from 50% to 100%. Similarly, the phrase "about 60% to about 100%" includes but is not limited to all the possible percentage numbers and fractions of a number from 60% to 100%; the phrase "about 70% to about 100%" includes but is not limited to all the possible percentage numbers and fractions of a number from 70% to 100%; the phrase "about 80% to about 100%" includes but is not limited to all the possible percentage numbers and fractions of a number from 80% to 100%; the phrase "about 85% to about 100%" includes all but is not limited to the possible percentage numbers and fractions of a number from 85% to 100%; the phrase "about 90% to about 100%" includes but is not limited to all the possible percentage numbers and fractions of a number from 90% to 100%; the phrase "about 95% to about 100%" includes all but is not limited to the possible percentage numbers and fractions of a number from 95% to 100%.<br>
As an example, and in no way limiting the generality of the above, a compound designated with the following formula:'<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
includes at least three chiral centers (the cyclohexyl carbon bonded to the oxygen at the 1 position, the cyclohexyl carbon bonded to the nitrogen at the 2 position, and the pyrrolidinyl carbon bonded to the oxygen at the 3' position) and therefore has at least four separate trans stereoisomers, which are (1R,2R)-2-[(3R)-Hydroxypyrrolidinyl]-1-(R3-, R4- and R5-substituted phenethoxy)cyclohexane; (1R,2R)-2-[(3S)-Hydroxypyrrolidinyl]-1-(R3-, R4- and R5-substituted phenethoxy)cyclohexane; (1S.2S)-2-[(3R)-Hydroxypyrrolidinyl]-1-(R3-, R4- and R!'-substituted phenethoxy)cyclohexane; and (1S,2S)-2-[(3S)-Hydroxypyrrolidinyl]-1-( R3-, R4- and R5-substituted phenethoxy)cyclohexane; and, unless the context make plain otherwise as used in this specification, a compound having the formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
means a composition that includes a component that is either one of the possible pure enantiomeric or diastereisomeric forms of the indicated compound or is a mixture of any two or more of the pure enantiomeric or diastereisomeric forms, where the mixture can include any number of the enantiomeric or diastereisomeric forms in any ratio.<br>
As an example, and in no way limiting the generality of the above, unless the context make plain otherwise as used in this specification, a compound designated with the compound name of (1R,2R)/(1S,2S)-2-[(3R)-hydroxypyrrolidinyl]-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethoxy)cyclohexane means a composition that includes a component that is either one or both of the two pure diastereomeric forms of the indicated compound (i.e., (1R,2R)-2-[(3R)-hydroxypyrrolidinyl]-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethoxy)cyclohexane or (1S,2S)-2-[(3R)-hydroxypyrrolidinyl]-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethoxy)cyclohexane) or is a mixture of the two pure diastereomeric forms, where the mixture can include any relative amount of the two diastereomers.<br>
The phrase "independently at each occurrence" is intended to mean (i) when any variable occurs more than one time in a compound of the invention, the definition of that variable at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence; and (ii) the identity of any one of two different variables (e.g., R3 within the set R3, R4 and R5) is selected without regard the identity of the other member of the set. However, combinations of substituents arid/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in compounds that do not violate the standard rules of chemical valency.<br>

"Clathrates" as used herein refers to substances which fix gases, liquids or compounds as inclusion complexes so that the complex may be handled in solid form and the included constituent (or "guest" molecule) subsequently releases by the action of a solvent or by melting.   Clathrates used in the instant invention may be prepared<br>
from cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins are widely known as having the ability to form clathrates with a variety of molecules. See, for example, Inclusion Compounds, edited by J.L. Atwood, J.E.D. Davies, and D.D. MacNicol, London, Orlando, Academic Press, 1984; Goldberg, I., "The Significance of Molecular Type, Shape and Complementarity in Clathrate Inclusion", Topics in Current Chemistry (1988), Vol. 149, pp. 2-44; Weber, E. eta/., "Functional Group Assisted Clathrate Formation - Scissor-Like and Roof-Shaped Host Molecules", Topics in Current Chemistry (1988), Vol. 149, pp. 45-135; and MacNicol, D.D. et a/., "Clathrates and Molecular Inclusion Phenomena", Chemical Society Reviews (1978), Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 65-87. Conversion into cyclodextrin clathrates is known to increase the stability arid solubility of certain compounds, thereby facilitating their use as pharmaceutical agents.  See, for example, Saenger, W., "Cyclodextrin Inclusion Compounds in Research and Industry", Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (1980), Vol. 19, pp. 344-362; U.S. Patent No. 4,886,788 (Schering AG); U.S. Patent No. 6,355,627 (Takasago); U.S. Patent No. 6,288,119 (Ono Pharmaceuticals); U.S. Patent No. 6,110,969 (Ono Pharmaceuticals); U.S. Patent No. 6,235,780 (Ono Pharmaceuticals); U.S. Patent No. 6,262,293 (Ono Pharmaceuticals); U.S. Patent No. 6,225,347 (Ono Pharmaceuticals); and U.S. Patent No. 4,935,446 (Ono Pharmaceuticals).<br>
"Cyclodextrin" refers to cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of at least six glucopyranose units which are joined together by a(1-4) linkages. The oligosaccharide ring forms a torus with the primary hydroxyl groups of the glucose residues lying on the narrow end of the torus. The secondary glucopyranose hydroxyl groups are located on the wider end. Cyclodextrins have been shown to form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions by binding the molecules into their cavities. The formation of such complexes protects the "guest" molecule from loss of evaporation, from attack by oxygen, visible and ultraviolet light and from intra- and intermolecular reactions. Such complexes also serve to "fix" a volatile material until the complex encounters a warm moist environment, at which point the complex will dissolve and dissociate into the guest molecule and the cyclodextrin. For purposes of this inveniton, the six-glucose unit containing cyclodextrin is specified as a-cyclodextrin, while the cyclodextrins with seven and eight glucose residues are designated as ร-cyclodextrin and y-cyclodextrin, respectively. The most common alternative to the cyclodextrin nomenclature is the naming of these compounds as cycloamyloses.<br>

Methods of the Invention<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and formula (II) contain ether and amino functional groups disposed in a 1,2 arrangement on a cyclohexane ring. Accordingly, the ether and amino functional groups are disposed in either a trans relationship relative to one another or a c/s relationship re'ative to one another and the plane of the cyclohexane ring as shown on the page in a two dimensional representation.<br>
The present invention provides synthetic methodology for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) and compounds of formula (II) as described herein. .<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and formula (II) may be prepared from aminoalcohols and alcohols by following the general methods described below. Some general synthetic processes for aminocyclohexyl ethers have been described in WO 99/50225 and references cited therein. Other processes that may be used for preparing compounds of formula (I) and formula (II) are described in PCT Published Patent Application WO 2004/099137, PCT Published Patent Application WO 2005/016242, and U.S. Patent No. 7,057,053 and other references disclosed therein.<br>
Methods for resolution of diastereomisomeric mixtures or racemic mixtures of the compounds of formula (i) and formula (II) or intermediates prepared herein are well known in the art (e.g., E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, in Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1994; Chapter 7, and references cited therein). Suitable processes such as crystallization (e.g. preferential crystallization, preferential crystallization in the presence of additives), asymmetric transformation of racemates, chemical separation (e.g. formation and separation of diastereomers such as diastereomeric salt mixtures or the use of other resolving agents; separation via complexes and inclusion compounds), kinetic resolution (e.g. with titanium tartrate catalyst), enzymatic resolution (e.g., lipase mediated) and chromatographic separation (e.g., HPLC with chiral stationary phase and/or with simulated moving bed technology, or supercritical fluid chromatography and related techniques) are some of the examples that may be applied (see e.g., T.J. Ward, Analytical Chemistry, 2002,<br>
2863-2872).<br>
The present invention also encompasses the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, amides, complexes, chelates, clathrates, solvates, crystalline or amorphous forms, metabolites, metabolic precursors or prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides can be prepared by reacting, respectively, a hydroxy or amino functional group with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid, such as identified above. A prodrug is a drug which has been chemically modified and may be biologically inactive at its site of action, but which is degraded or modified by one or more enzymatic or other in vivo processes to the parent bioactive form. Generally, a prodrug has a different pharmacokinetic profile than the parent drug such that, for example, it is more easily absorbed across the mucosal epithelium, it has better salt formation or solubility and/or it has better systemic stability (e.g., an increased plasma half-life).<br>
Those skilled in the art recognize that chemical modifications of a parent drug to yield a prodrug include: (1) terminal ester or amide derivatives, which are susceptible to being cleaved by esterases or lipases; (2) terminal peptides, which may be recognized by specific or nonspecific proteases; or (3) a derivative that causes the prodrug to accumulate at a site of action through membrane selection, and combinations of the above techniques. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of prodrug derivatives are described in H. Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs, (1985). Those skilled in the art are well-versed in the preparation of prodrugs and are well-aware of its meaning.<br>
The present invention also encompasses the pharmaceutically acceptable complexes, chelates, metabolites, or metabolic precursors of the compounds of the present invention. Information about the meaning these terms and references to their preparation can be obtained by searching various databases, for example Chemical Abstracts and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website.

The synthetic procedures described herein, especially when taken with the general knowledge in the art, provide sufficient guidance to those of ordinary skill in the art to perform the synthesis, isolation, and purification of the compounds of the present invention. Further, it is contemplated that the individual features of these embodiments and examples may be combined with the features of one or more other embodiments or examples.<br>
It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsily! (for example, f-butyldimethylsi!yl, f-butyfdiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and toe like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include /-butoxycarbonyi, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include -C(O)-R" (whore R" is alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl), p-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alky!, aryl or arylalkyl esters.<br>
Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and as described herein.<br>
The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T.W. and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1999), 3rd Ed., Wiley.<br>
Any or all of the compounds set forth in any of the Reaction Schemes herein may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by reaction with an inorganic or organic acid under appropriate conditions known to one skilled in the art.<br>
!n addition, any or all of the compounds set forth in the Reaction Schemes herein may be subjected to standard deprotection conditions in order to arrive at the desired functional group.<br>
In addition, at any point in any of the Reaction Schemes disclosed herein, the starting material, an intermediate or a product so formed may be subjected to a resolution process whereby individual enantiomers or diastereomers are separated into starting materials, intermediates or products that are in stereoisomerically substantially pure form. These individual enantiomers, diastereomers or mixtures thereof, can then be used in the method disclosed in any of the Reaction Schemes herein to prepare stereoisomericaily substantially pure forms of the compounds of formula (I), or mixtures thereof. Methods for resolution of racemates or other stereoisomeric mixtures are well<br>
known in the art (e.g., E.L Elie) and S.H. Wilen, in Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1994; Chapter 7, and references cited therein). Suitable processes may include but are not limited to separation of stereoisomers by crystallization (e.g. preferential crystallization, preferential crystallization in the presence of additives), asymmetric transformation of racemates or diastereomeric mixtures, chemical separation (e.g. formation and separation of diastereomers such as diastereomeric salt mixtures or the use of other resolving agents; separation via complexes and inclusion compounds), kinetic resolution (e.g. with titanium tartrate catalyst), enzymatic resolution (e.g., lipase mediated, carbonyJ reductase mediated) and chromatographic separation (e.g., HPLC with chiral stationary phase and/or with simulated moving bed technology, or supercritical fluid chromatography and related techniques) (see e.g., T.J. Ward, Analytical Chemistry, 2002, 2863-2872).<br>

REACTION SCHEME 1A<br>
(Scheme  Removed)<br>
In general, the compounds of formula (I) are prepared in Reaction Scheme 1A by first treating a compound of formula (1) with a compound of formula (2) in an aprotic solvent, such as toluene, dichlorornethane, or ethyl acetate, followed by the treatment with an cyclizing agent, such as a Cz-Csacy! halide or C2-C5acyl anhydride, at temperatures of between about 0ยฐC to reflux temperature, preferably at reflux temperature, to form a compound of formula (3). Alternatively, a compound of formula (1) is first treated with a compound of formula (2) in an aprotic solvent to yield a corresponding intermediate, which is then treated with a cyclizing agent to form compounds of formula (3). Compounds of formula (3) are then subjected to standard deprotection conditions known to one skilled in the art, such as hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst under appropriate conditions, to form the compound of formula<br>
 (4). The compound of formula (4) is then treated with a compound of formula (5) under conditions such that the stereochemical spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group of compound of formula (4) is retained in the resulting compound of formula (6). Such conditions include, but are not limited to, the presence of a Lewis or Br0nsted acid, (for example, HBF^EtjA BF3.Et2O, TMSOTf, ZnCI2, TMS-CI, CF3SO3H, HCI, CH3SO3H, H2SO4, p-TSA, camphorsulfonic acid, CF3SO3Ag), preferably a catalytic amount of the Lewis or Br0nsted acid, in an aprotic solvent. The compound of formula (5) may be optionally protected prior to the treatment with compound of formula (4). The compound of formula (6) so formed is then subjected to standard reducing conditions known to one skilled in the art to arrive at the compound of formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, another general method of stereoselectively preparing the compounds of formula (I) is illustrated below in Reaction Scheme 1B wherein Q, R, R2a, R2, R3, R" and R5 are as defined above in Reaction Scheme 1A:<br>
REACTION SCHEME 1B<br>
(Scheme  Removed)<br>
In general, the compounds of formula (I) are prepared in Reaction Scheme 1B by first treating a compound of formula (1a) with a compound of formula (2) in an aprotic solvent, such as toluene, dichloromethane, or ethyl acetate, followed by the treatment of the resulting product with a compound of formula (5) under conditions such that upon reaction with the compound of formula (5) the stereochemical spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group at the 1-position of the compound of formula (1a) is<br>
retained in the resulting product. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, the presence of a Lewis or Bronsted acid, (for example, HBF4.Et2O, BF3.Et2O, TMSOTf, ZnC!2, TMS-CI, CF3SO3H, HCI, CH3SO3H, H2SO4, p-TSA, camphorsulfonic acid, CF3SO3Ag), preferably a catalytic amount of the Lewis or Bransted acid, in an aprotic solvent. The resulting product is then treated with a cyclizing agent, such as a C2-C5 acyl chloride or acetic anhydride, at temperatures of between about 0ยฐC to reflux temperature, preferably at reflux temperature, to form a compound of formula (6). The compound of formula (6) so formed is then subjected to standard reducing conditions known to one skilled in the art to arrive at the compound of formula (I).<br>
The oxygen-protecting groups for R1 and R can be any oxygen-protecting group for alcohols as set forth in T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley-lnterscience, New York, NY (1999)("Green") for the protection of alcohols. Preferably the oxygen-protecting gj-oup for R1 is an optionally substituted benzyl group, wherein the optional substituents on the benzyl group are as set forth in Green. Preferred oxygen-protecting groups for R are C2-C5acyl groups. The compound of formula (1) wherein R1 is benzyl can be obtained from BASF (Switzerland) (see, PCT Published Patent Application WO 96/23894). Compounds of formula (1) can also be obtained from ASDI (601 Interchange Blvd. Newark, DE 19711, USA) and ABCR GmbH &amp; Co. KG (Im Schlehert 10, 76187 Karlsruhe, Germany) or can be prepared according to methods known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of formula (5) can be prepared by methods known to one skilled in the art or by methods disclosed herein. The "Q" in the compounds of formula (5) represents a good leaving group which results in the formation of a compound of formula (6) such that the trans relative configuration or spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 1-position in the compound of formula (4) or the compound of formula (1a) is retained in that of the compound of formula (6), resulting in the retention of the trans relative configuration or spatial arrangement of the arnine and ether substituents on the cyclohexyl ring in the compounds of formula (I). Haloacetimidate (e.g. 2,2,2-trifluoroacetimidate or 2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate) is a preferred example of a compound of formula (5) containing a suitable Q group for the purposes of this invention. For some compounds of the formula (4) in Reaction Scheme 1A and/or the intermediates formed in Reaction Scheme 1B, it may be necessary to introduce appropriate protecting groups to the compounds of formula (5) prior to the etherification step with the compound of formula (5) being performed. Suitable protecting groups and the corresponding deprotection conditions are set forth<br>
in, for example, T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley-lnterscience, New York, NY (1999) and references cited therein.<br>
Other examples of suitable Q groups for the compounds of formula (5) are provided below in Table A. (For a review of the application of various examples of Q in the formation of an ether compound with an alcohol see, for example, Toshima K. and Tatsuta K. Chem. Rev. 1993, 93, 1503, Tsuda T., Nakamura S. and Hashimoto S. Tetrahedron Lett. 2003, 44, 6453, Martichonok V. arid Whitesides G. M. J. Org. Chem., 1996, 61, 1702 and references cited therein.). As noted below in Table A, in addition to haloacetimidate (e.g. trihaloacetimidate such as 2,2,2-trifluoroacetJmidate or 2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate) and other imidate esters (e.g. pentafluorobenzimidate), other examples of suitable Q groups for the compounds of formula (5), include, but are not limited to, O-carbonates and S-carbonates, including imidazole carbonates and imidazoiethiocarbonates.

Compounds of formula (2) are chosen to yield compounds of formula (3) in Reaction Scheme 1A and compounds of formula (6) in Reaction Scheme 1B above. Examples of compounds of formula (2) include, but are not limited to, the following compounds:<br>
wherein R is an oxygen-protecting group; each R2a is O or H2, where at least one R2a group in each structure is O, and Y is halo. Compounds of formula (2a) can be prepared, for example, from malic acid and C2-C5acyl chloride according to the procedures described in Henrot, S. etal., Synthetic Communications 1986, 16(2), 183-190, or can be prepared according to methods known to one skilled in the art. Compounds of formula (2b) are commercially available or can be prepared according to methods known to one skilled in the art. Additional protection and deprotection steps, depending on the blocking groups, may be necessary to arrive at the desired product.<br>
Several of the steps disclosed in the above Reaction Scheme 1A or Reaction Scheme 1B may be combined without isolation of the product so formed or removal of the solvent. Specific examples of such "one-pot" synthesis are disclosed herein.<br>
The advantages of the above Reaction Scheme 1A and Reaction Scheme 1B over published processes for preparing compounds of formula (I) are as follows:<br>
1.	Each reaction step can be easily monitored by HPLC.<br>
2.	The overall yield of compound of formula (I) is greater than the overall<br>
yield of compound of formula (I) in the published processes for compounds of formula<br>
(I).<br>
3.	Only a catalytic amount of acid is needed for the etherification step<br>
instead of a supra-stoichiornetric amount (&gt;1 eq) , although a steichiometric or suprastoichiornetnc amount of acid can be used.<br>
4.	Several steps can be combined in one reaction vessel which would<br>
reduce processing time and production plant usage.<br>
5.	The process is an efficient enantioselective process in that no undesired<br>
isomers are generated, thereby avoiding costly resolution steps, or the loss of costly<br>
material in the form of undesired isomers.<br>

In general, the amine of formula (1) is first condensed with a compound of formula (2a) in a suitable solvent (such as toluene, dichloromethane, or ethyl acetate) to give compound of formula (7) or formula (8). When the A/-acylation of compound of formula (1) was shown to be complete by HPLC, the solvent was removed under vacuum. The mixture of the compounds of formula (7)/(8) was refluxed in an C2-C5acyl<br>

first removing the solvent was shown to also be useful for cyclization.<br>
After the removal of excess acetyl chloride, compound of formula (3) was then subjected to standard hydrogenolysis condition (Pd/C- H2-in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, methanol, ethyl acetate, Ra-Ni-H2, Pt/C-H2) at ambient temperature to remove the oxygen-protecting group to give compound of formula (4). Etherification of compound of formula (4) with compound of formula (5) under catalytic Lewis acid conditions (e.g., HBF<t etherate gave the corresponding imido-ether of formula finally successive reduction compound with a suitable reducing agent for example borane nabk acid kbh4 red-ai e.g. alimardanov et al. org. proc. res. dev. or lithium aluminum hydride naylor a. cited above provided as free base. subsequent treatment hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether and trituration ethyl acetate hydrochloride salt></t>

The starting material, frms-arninocyclohexanol (compound of formula (1a)), can be prepared from a mixture of c/s- and frans-stereoisomers by standard resolution techniques or by methods known to one skilled in the art. In general, the method disclosed in Reaction Scheme 1B1 is a "one-pot" process of acylatiori, acetimidate ether coupling, and cyclization, i.e., the process does not require the isolation of intermediates from the reaction mixture and/or the removal of solvents, to give compound of formula (6), which is then subjected to standard reducing conditions to form the compound of formula (I). More specifically, the acylation was accomplished using 1.05 equivalents of the compound of formula (2a) at ambient temperature in a suitable solvent such as toluene, dichloromethane, or ethyl acetate. The addition of compound of formula (5), preferably trichloroacetimidate, and then a catalytic amount of a Lewis acid, preferably tetrafluoroboric acid etherate, yielded a mixture of<br>
components in which the desired material could be identified by HPLC. The reaction mixture was then treated with an C2-C5acyl halide, preferably acetyl chloride, and refluxed for 1 hour to give the imido ether of formula (6), which was isolated from the reaction mixture by standard isolation techniques, such as flash column chromatography. Subsequent reduction of the compound of formula (6) and treatment under standard acid addition salt formation, such as treatment with hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether and trituration in ethyl acetate, gave the salt, preferably the hydrochloride salt, of the compound of formula (I).<br>

Briefly, the acylation of the starting material (1a) was accomplished by condensing the compound with the anhydride of formula (2a) under suitable condensation conditions, such as ambient temperature in dichloromethane, to give a mixture of the compounds of formula (9) and formula (10). The mixture of these compounds was then treated with a compound of formula (5), followed by the addition of a catalytic amount of a Lewis acid, preferably tetrafluoroboric acid etherate, under<br><br>
suitable conditions to yield a mixture of compounds of formula (11) and formula (12). The mixture of these compounds was then treated under suitable cyclization conditions, such as treatment with a cyclizing agent, such as acetyl chloride, and refluxed for 1 hour to give the compound of formula (6), which was isolated from the reaction mixture by standard isolation techniques, such as flash column chromatography. Subsequent treatment of the compound of formula (6) under standard reducing conditions provided the compound of formula (I), which was then treated under standard acid addition salt formation conditions, such as treatment with hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether and trituration in ethyl acetate, to give the salt, preferably the hydrochloride salt, of the compound of formula (I).<br>
