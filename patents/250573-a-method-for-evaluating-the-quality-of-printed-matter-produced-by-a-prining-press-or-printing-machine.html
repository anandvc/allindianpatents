				<td>The invention relates to a method for evaluating the quality of printed matter <br>
produced by printing press or a printing machine with the printing machine <br>
producing several copies of the same printed matter.<br>
Print images generates by a printing machine are checked for print since a long <br>
time by the operating personnel of the printing machine during a running <br>
production, either visually or with the help of optical auxiliary agents. According <br>
to the assessment of the operating person, a classification takes, i.e. a <br>
categorization of the assessed print products in a group of print products with <br>
prior laid-down features, i.e. certain error features that were the object of the <br>
previous inspection. The total quality of the checked print products is classified in <br>
a part quantity or grade with a good quality and a part quantity or grade with a <br>
bad quality, i.e. not usable or marketable quality, whereby the print image of the <br>
print products to be assessed is judged as either good or as bad, i.e. as <br>
defective. Assessment of the quality of a print product by a printing machine by <br>
the operating personnel is subject to extensive fluctuations, as the assessment <br>
depends on the judging capacity and particularly the knowledge and experience <br>
of the assessing person, and as a result varies from person to person.<br>
Nowadays, camera systems are increasingly being used in the printing industry <br>
for different applications, e.g. in inspection systems, web observation systems or <br>
registration measuring systems, whereby these systems are arranged either in a <br>
printing machine or in a machine processing print material. These systems carry<br><br><br>
out their functions, for example, 'inline', i.e. during the running production of the <br>
print product to be used, which poses a significant challenge on account of the <br>
large data quality supplied by a camera system and the fast process sequence in <br>
production of the print product for the respective camera system and an image <br>
processing system evaluating its image data. The problem becomes more acute <br>
if the print product has spectral-photometric features or identification features <br>
that are difficult to identify, and in a quality control a reliable assessment is <br>
required even for these identification features in spite of the usually high	<br><br><br>
transportation speed of the print product in the short time that is available. Furthermore, <br>
valuable print products, i.e. in the production of currency notes, security bonds or <br>
certificates, each individual identification feature of the print product has to be subjected <br>
to a test. At the same time, due to economic reasons, there is the requirement that <br>
particularly in high-valued print products, e.g. in the production of currency notes or <br>
security bonds, precisely because of their high material costs and production costs, the <br>
quantity of wastage has to be kept as less as possible, as long as it is justifiable on the <br>
basis of a prior laid-down quality standard.<br>
In the camera systems mentioned above, often electronic image sensors are used for <br>
taking pictures, particularly colour cameras with at least one image sensor consisting of a <br>
CCD-chip, whose light-sensitive pixel gives out an output signal corresponding to the <br>
colour scanned in the observation zone, e.g. in three separated signal channels, i.e. the <br>
colour channels at least for the colours red, green and blue.<br>
There is the need to evaluate the output signal of a photographing unit, i.e. image data of <br>
the picture taken by the photographing unit, with an image processing system connected <br>
to the photographing unit in such a way, that a need-based, balanced assessment of the <br>
quality of the print product produced by a printing machine can take place. For assessing <br>
the quality, the print product is preferably tested for different criteria.<br>
From the post-published document DE 103 35 147 A1 we know of a method for <br>
determining the condition of bank notes in which data of at least two different properties <br>
of the bank notes are evaluated, in which the data of at least two different properties of <br>
each bank notes are linked with one another and the condition of the bank note is derived <br>
from the linked data of different properties. It can also be foreseen that an average value <br>
for each of the different properties is determined for a quantity of bank notes in order to <br>
determine the condition of the quantity of bank notes for the respectively different <br>
properties, or that an average value for the linked properties for a quantity of bank notes <br>
is determined in order to determine the total condition of the quantity of bank notes.<br><br><br><br>
The similarly post-published document DE 103 14 071 B3 relates to a methods for <br>
qualitative assessment of a material with at least one identification feature, whereby with <br>
an electronic image sensor at least one colour image is scanned of the identification <br>
feature, whereby the image sensor directly or indirectly provides at least one first <br>
electrical signal correlated to the colour image, whereby an evaluation device connected <br>
to the image sensor evaluates the first electrical signal, whereby from at least one <br>
reference image a second electrical signal is obtained and stored in a data storage, <br>
whereby a second electrical signal has for at least two different properties of the reference <br>
image respectively a rated value for the first electrical signal, whereby the first signal is <br>
compared with at least two rated values contained in the second electrical signal, whereby <br>
in the comparison at least the colour image of the identification feature is tested for a <br>
colour variation from the reference image and the identification feature is tested for <br>
association to a certain grade of identification features or tested for a definite geometric <br>
contour or for a relative arrangement with respect to at least another identification feature <br>
of the material. The material could be a bank currency note or a security bond. In any <br>
case, it has to do with testing of the material, i.e. testing of a single piece with which at <br>
least one identification feature of the concerned material is checked with respect to <br>
certain criteria in different but independently conducted test sequences parallel to one <br>
another.<br>
From the document DE 102 34 086 A1 we know of a method for signal evaluation of an <br>
electronic image sensor in the sample identification of image contents of a test body, in <br>
which the categorisation of the test body to a particular grade of a test bodies is decided. <br>
In this method, the content of an image scanned by the test body is evaluated on the basis <br>
of an associative function formed on the basis of methods of fuzzy logic, whereby even <br>
several associative functions can be linked with one another to a super-ordained <br>
associative function.<br>
From the document DE 102 34 085 Al we know of a method for analysing colour <br>
variations of images scanned by an image sensor, whereby the image signal received by <br>
the image sensor is analysed pixel-wise.<br><br><br>
From the document DE 101 32 589 A1 we know of a method for qualitative assessment <br>
of printed material with at least one identification feature, in which an image of the <br>
material to be assessed is scanned by an image sensor, and for this image the geometric <br>
contour and/or the relative arrangement of several identification features among one <br>
another is evaluated in an evaluating unit.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create a method for assessing a quality of a print product <br>
produced by a printing machine, in which errors occurring in the production of several <br>
copies of these print products are assessed in a balanced manner.<br>
This task is fulfilled by the invention with the help of the features mentioned in claim 1.<br>
The advantages that can be achieved with the help of the invention are mainly, that the <br>
assessment of the quality of print product produced by a printing machine takes place in a <br>
very balanced manner on a broad basis, because each detected error is not assessed <br>
singularly but in the context of other identified errors, because a holistic assessment of all <br>
errors that have occurred in a selective quantity of copies takes place in such a way, that <br>
the errors are assessed in relation to one another, through which in the final result the <br>
yield of copies of the print product classified as marketable or at least worthy of further <br>
processing gets increased. The method thus increases productivity and cost-effectiveness <br>
in the production process of the print products. A required quality standard is ensured <br>
and unnecessary wastage is avoided.<br>
As samples from the selected quantity of produced copies of the print product is <br>
subjected to scanning by an image sensor generating common image data, there cannot be <br>
any position differences between the detected errors, i.e. errors in their respective <br>
location data, because the obtained image data is evaluated pixel-precise, so that in the <br>
calculations for assessing the quality of samples of the print product produced in the <br>
printing machine, corrections in the determined positions of the detected errors can be <br>
dispensed with, which could however be necessary if errors are determined by multiple<br><br><br>
sensors that are positioned differently with respect to the samples of the print product to <br>
be tested. Therefore, it is a special advantage of the suggested solution, that all the errors <br>
to be assessed in relation to one another can be detected from the image data of the same <br>
scan.<br>
Errors identified in a produced print product are weighed in relation to their topology, <br>
e.g. combined in a super-ordained, multi-dimensional associational function and assessed <br>
in a combined viewing of all detected errors on the basis of a preferably need-based- <br>
parameter-able classification threshold. The method can also be utilized to evaluate the <br>
assessment obtained from the image data with respect to a gradual variation in the quality <br>
of produced print products. A gradual variation in quality of produced print products can <br>
be identified before it grows into defects causing large wastage.<br>
The method is particularly suited for assessing the quality of a high-valued print product <br>
whose production is expensive, e.g. in valuable print product, e.g. a bank currency note or <br>
a security bond.<br>
A design example of the invention is depicted in the accompanying drawings and <br>
described in details <br>
below.<br>
The following are shown:<br>

An inspection system used as a model for assessing the quality of a print product <br>
produced by a printing machine has one or more colour-lines cameras 01 coupled with <br>
one another, as shown in fig. 1, or an image scanning unit 01 designed as colour surface<br><br><br>
camera 01, that scans a print image 03 lit up by a lighting unit 02, whereby a print image <br>
03 has been generated with a printing machine on a printing material (not shown) <br>
consisting of paper. The image data of the individual colour channels determined by the <br>
image scanning unit 01 from the picture of print image 03 are evaluated in an image <br>
processing system 04. The output of the result takes place, for example, on a monitor 06 <br>
connected to the image processing system 04. Inputs, e.g. parameters to be essentially <br>
conveyed to the image processing system 04 for its calculations, are fed through a <br>
keyboard 07 connected to the image processing system 04. The image scanning unit 01 <br>
is arranged in the printing machine in such a way that with each scan the respective print <br>
image of several samples of the print product produced in this printing machine is <br>
determined.<br>
The printing machine is preferably designed as a rotary printing press, especially as a <br>
printing machine printing in offset method, in a steel plate relief method, silk screen <br>
method or in a hot-press method. If the printing machine is designed as a sheet-fed offset <br>
machine, it should be ensured that the sheet can be inspected even at a machine speed of <br>
say 18000 sheets per second. If the printing substance to be printed on is a material track, <br>
then the inspection system should be in a position to subject the quality of samples of the <br>
print product that are guided through the printing machine at a machine velocity of 15 <br>
m/sec. to inspection of single pieces.<br>
Errors occurring in the production of the print product, e.g. a bank currency note, can be <br>
categorised for certain types of errors, e.g.<br>
a)	colour error, if at a certain position of the print material a wrong colour has <br>
been printed;<br>
b)	error of intensity, if the correct colour tone has been printed at a particular <br>
position of the printing substance, but however not in the desired correct <br>
colour intensity;<br>
c)	contour errors, if the print image or an identification feature of the print image <br>
is at least partly defective in its outline, i.e. particularly incomplete; or<br><br><br>
d) layout errors, if a mask thread or any other identification feature of the print <br>
image is missing or appearing in a wrong location.<br>
The error types can once again the categorised with respect to certain properties, namely <br>
whether the defect of a particular defect type occurs in a series of several samples of the <br>
print product produced in a printing machine, e.g. as single error or as multiple error. <br>
Also colour defect and intensity defect can be classified and evaluated with respect to the <br>
respective error magnitude, i.e. with respect to the area-wise extent of the defect. Thus <br>
the quality of the print product at least with respect to certain types of defects and/or a <br>
defect quantity and/or a defect magnitude can be assessed.<br>
On account of the production method applied in a printing machine it can be assumed <br>
that in several sample of the print product printed one after the other, the occurring <br>
printing defects occur column-wise relative to the printing cylinders of the printing <br>
mechanism of the printing press, i.e. the errors get repeated on the print substance on a <br>
line in its movement direction through the printing mechanism, by which a further <br>
property of an error can be defined. If required, the mentioned error types and/or <br>
properties of the errors can be supplemented with further error features. Particularly for <br>
conducting the method for assessment of quality of a print product in a machine <br>
processing the print material and connected to the printing press, it should also be <br>
considered as a side-condition that an inspection of the print material can take place in a <br>
so-called half-sheet evaluation or even alternatively only half-wise.<br>
A starting situation for the method for assessing the quality of a print product could <br>
consist of the following: that several inspection channels i with i = 1 to imax, here e.g. <br>
with imax = 4 correspond to the four error types - colour error, intensity error, contour <br>
error and layout error- are foreseen, that for each individual sample of print product the <br>
error quantity M should be assessed M = 1 to Mmax or the error magnitude N with N = 1 <br>
to Nmax pixel of the image sensor, and that for several printed samples of the print <br>
product following one another, occurring print errors the number K of the errors m <br>
content in a column s should be considered as K = 1 to Kmax and the application or non-<br><br><br>
application of the half-sheet evaluation should be considered as yes/no decision. The <br>
method foresees that the four inspection channels i, the error quantity M or the error <br>
magnitude N and the number K of the errors m contained in the same column s should be <br>
fuzzified. A defuzzification for assessing the quality of a print product can consist of a <br>
simple evaluation of an integer value L obtained from the method, in that it is checked <br>
whether the integer value L obtained from the method is greater than a set threshold value <br>
Lmax, i.e. L &gt; Lmax by setting the threshold value Lmax follows the fixing of a degree, <br>
from which the produced print product can fuzzified as good or as bad, i.e. defective, i.e. <br>
with the threshold value Lmax the quality standard required for the print product is fixed. <br>
All errors and/or properties to be assessed in relation to one another are detected from the <br>
image data of the same scan of the image sensor, which is why a coordination of the <br>
image data with respect to the location of a detected error and/or a detected peculiarity is <br>
not required.<br>
A part of a sequence of this method has been depicted as an example in fig. 2 in a signal <br>
flow diagram. The signal shows a hierarchic structure of the method.<br>
The fuzzification can foresee that the inspection channels i are arranged linearly in a first<br>
associative function uc, e.g	 The error quantity M is similarly allocated linearly in a<br>
second associative function uf, whereby the error quantity M is preferably limited to a <br>
maximum number Mmax of the error M, in that the detected errors m with the maximum <br>
number Mmax of the errors m can be weighed as a weighing factor. As a second <br>
associative function µx one then obtains	<br>
The method for assessing the quality of a print product seeks to conjunctively aggregate <br>
the first associative function uc and the second associative function ux, i.e. to link both <br>
the associative functions µc; µf multiplicatively with one another. The multiplication of <br>
both associative functions µc: µf gives a new first aggregated associative function µg1, <br>
which can be depicted according to the example described here as follows:<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a graphic depiction of a first aggregated associative function µgl, whereby <br>
as example 4 inspection channels i and for the error quantity the value Mmax = 20 have <br>
been selected. The first aggregated associative function µgl has a value range between 0 <br>
and 1.<br>
Even the number K of the errors m contained in a column s can be fuzzified, once again <br>
preferably in a linear allocation, so that under the knowledge that in the column a number <br>
Ns of successive printed samples of the print product are evaluated, a third associative<br>
function us can be set up as us =	with s	 The third associative function us<br>
can similarly be conjunctively aggregated with the first associative function us and/or <br>
second associative function uf. For example, by means of a conjunctive aggregation of <br>
all three associative functions uc; uf; us one obtains a second aggregated associative <br>
function µg2 that can be depicted as follows:<br>
For the sake of simplicity, in the three associative functions µc; µf; µs linear allocations <br>
were made for their respective elements. Of course, depending on the requirement, for <br>
one or more of the associative functions µc; µf; µs also non-linear allocations are <br>
possible.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a graphic depiction of this second aggregated associative function µg2, <br>
whereby as an example 4 inspection channels i, for the error quantity M the value Mmax <br>
= 20 and for the number Ns of the successive printed samples the value Ns = 6 were <br>
selected. Like the first aggregated associative function µgl, the second aggregated <br>
associative function µg2 has a value range between 0 and 1 as given on the Y-axis of the <br>
diagram. The linear allocations selected here as examples are clearly identifiable. The <br>
second aggregated associative function µg2 is a multi-dimensional, here four- <br>
dimensional function, in which for its depiction the Y-axis of the diagram has been used<br><br><br><br>
twice, mainly for depicting the number Ns of successive printed samples of print product <br>
per column s and for depicting the value range of this second aggregated associative <br>
function ug2. The double utilization is made possible by the superimposition of the <br>
individual samples of the print product per column s with a respective inspection channel <br>
i, whereby a block size shown in the diagram gets enlarged with each edition of a further <br>
inspection channel i.<br>
According to the depiction of the second aggregated associative function µg2 in fig. 4, <br>
for its value of µg2 = 0.3 a threshold value Lmax is defined through a horizontal surface <br>
parallel to the basic surface of the diagram, whereby the surface forms a classification <br>
threshold Lmax. Depending on the respective application, i.e. the respective required <br>
quality of the print product to be produced, the classification threshold Lmax is <br>
preferably set for ug2 in the range of 0.2 to 0.4. From the example shown in fig. 4 it is <br>
clear that in the parameters selected here as model for error detection, with only one <br>
single inspection channel i, i.e. i = 1, even for an error quantity M of 15 errors m, a <br>
sample of the print product to be tested for its quality is still assessed as good. Only <br>
during error detection with two inspection channels i, i.e. i = 2, and an error quantity M <br>
of 10 errors m per sample of the print product to be tested, a printed sheet, assuming that <br>
Ns = 6 samples of the print product in a certain column s are arranged on the print sheet, <br>
is assessed to be of bad quality and preferably removed from the production flow.<br>
The second aggregated associative function µg2 is parameter-able in an extension to the <br>
extent that a weight-age g with respect to the inspection channel i can be controlled. In <br>
this case, for the second aggregated associative function µg2 one obtains the following <br>
depiction:<br>
µg2 =	<br>
with i	<br>
Fig. 5 shows a graphic depiction of a parameterized second aggregated associative <br>
function ug2, in which as an example 5 inspection channels i, for Mmax the value Mmax<br><br><br>
= 20, for Ns the value Ns = 6 and for the inspection channels i the weightage g of g = 0.3 <br>
have been selected. The classification threshold Lmax was again fixed at µg2 = 0.3.<br>
Similarly, in the method for assessing the quality of a print product, the error quantity M <br>
can be substituted by the error magnitude N, or the error magnitude N can be taken in as <br>
a further criterion.<br>
The method described for assessing the quality of a print product means in the application <br>
that not each individual error detected on a printed sheet should lead to the fact that this <br>
printed sheet should be removed as wastage. Rather, each individual detected error is <br>
assessed in its context, whereby with the help of mathematical means, particularly by <br>
applying method of fuzzy logic, the gravity of each error is weighed and/or assessed <br>
particularly in alternating relationship in other detected errors and/or in proportion to <br>
other detected errors. Accordingly, a holistic assessment of all errors takes place which <br>
have been defined within the quantity of samples of the print product printed on a <br>
particular sheet, whereby the errors detected within the selected quantity are assessed in <br>
their respective relation to one another. The assessment of errors in their respective <br>
relation to one another is favourable, in that all errors to be assessed are almost <br>
simultaneously determined by the same image scanning unit 01 and all information <br>
required for assessing the quality of the print product can be taken from the image data <br>
corresponding to the scan.<br>
For example, the risk in errors bank currency notes produced in the steel-plate relief <br>
offset method is comparatively high; however even the material costs and the total <br>
production costs of this print product are relatively high. With the help of the described <br>
method, in the actual printing process a preliminary selection with respect to the printed <br>
sheet can be made. Sheets that do not exceed the number of errors laid down in the <br>
classification threshold Lmax are fed to a machine that will further process the sheet, <br>
whereby each sample of the print product printed on the respective sheet can be subjected <br>
once again to an individual test. Such a machine connected to the printing press could be <br>
a cutting unit, particularly a cutting unit for individually separating the samples of the<br><br><br>
print product printed on each sheet, which have already formed a number-wise restricted <br>
quantity of samples for assessment of their quality. Such a number-wise restricted <br>
quantity of samples could be in a few tens or even a few hundreds or more samples of the <br>
print product. In the production of the print product, due to the successive sequence of <br>
the produced samples of the print product, several such number-wise equal batches can <br>
be selected one after the other in the production flow for quality test. Thus a fixed <br>
number of associatively produced samples can be combined to a batch of samples, <br>
whereby successively several batches of samples are formed. All produced samples are <br>
preferably allocated to one of these batches. From each of these batches also an image of <br>
their respective sample is made in order to subject the produced samples of the print <br>
product to a flawless assessment of their qualities.<br>
Each sheet having several copies of the print product, e.g. several bank currency notes <br>
can be subjected to a further quality tests, in that during the post-processing those copies <br>
of the print product which had been earlier classified as good quantity are removed, that <br>
either reveal very big errors or a particularly high number of errors. As in the <br>
preliminary test the entire sheet is not being classified as wastage, the yield of the <br>
produced print product increases. At the same time, the post-processing does not have to <br>
bear the load of sheets in which strong errors were not detected during pre-sorting.<br>
The additional evaluation of the assessment obtained from the image data with respect to <br>
a gradual variation in the quality of produced print product takes place by means of a link <br>
with a data of at least one machine sensor. Such a machine sensor could be a vibration <br>
recorder on a machine frame of the printing press. In a printing press printing in the <br>
(wet-) offset method, the machine sensor can also be designed as sensor controlling the <br>
feed of the wet agent. In a printing press printing in the (wet) offset method or in a steel- <br>
plate relief method, it may be appropriate to measure the temperature of a tempering <br>
agent tempering the forming cylinder of a printing press, especially a cooling agent <br>
cooling the cylinder, with the help of a sensor to take the measured data of this sensor <br>
into account additionally in the quality test of the print product produced in the printing <br>
press. In a printing press printing in the steel-plate relief method it could also be<br><br><br><br>
meaningful to additionally monitor the power consumption a wiping unit removing the <br>
ink overflow from the steel-plate with a machine sensor and to consider the information <br>
derived from the measured signal of the machine sensor about a too high or too low <br>
wiping in the quality test of the print products produced by the printing press.<br>
In the result, the errors detected from the common picture in the print image of the print <br>
products to be produced are assessed in their relation to one another, whereby the <br>
assessment thus obtained can be additionally linked to the information of at least one <br>
further machine sensor in a control unit carrying out the evaluation, in order to especially <br>
identify at an early stage any variation, especially gradually setting in variation in the <br>
quality of the produced print product. From the measured signals of the at least one <br>
additional machine sensor, the control unit can obtain the information that the printing <br>
machine is for example in a print-technically critical operating condition, so that it is <br>
probable that errors causing wastage in a short time manifest themselves on the sample of <br>
the produced print products. Already now the control unit can intervene in the printing <br>
process, in that at least one unit of the printing press influencing the printing process is <br>
automatically post-guided by the control unit in order to bring the printing press back <br>
from its print-technically critical operating condition to its proper operating condition. <br>
Thus a control process or a regulating process evaluating measured signals of the <br>
machine sensors serves the purpose of early detection of negative influences relevant for <br>
the printing process, whereas the assessment obtained from the print image of the <br>
produced print products especially confirms the adherence to quality specifications and, if <br>
required, documents it in the sense of a quality proof.<br>
On the other hand, depending on the assessment of the quality obtained from the print <br>
image of the produced print products, those aggregates of the printing machine can be <br>
post-regulated that are in a critical operating condition, whereby each of these units <br>
influencing the printing process has a machine sensor monitoring these units, whereby <br>
the control unit determines at least one unit negatively influencing the printing process on <br>
the basis of the detected errors and/or the relevant measured signals of the respective <br>
machine sensors and alters the setting of the at least one determined unit till such time as<br><br><br>
the assessment of the quality of the print products obtained from the print image of the <br>
produced print products again reaches the classification level of good. In this case, in <br>
conjunction with the assessment obtained from the print image of the produced print <br>
products, settings of units of the printing machine with the allied machine sensors are <br>
checked regarding their relevance with respect to their quality of the print product to be <br>
produced and, if required, automatically altered by the control unit for fulfilling the <br>
quality specifications.<br>
