FIELD The present disclosure relates to engine systems and more<br>
particularly to methods and systems for compensating for disturbances in a<br>
crankshaft signal.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
 The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
 Vehicles include an internal combustion engine that generates<br>
drive torque. More specifically, the engine draws in air and mixes the air with fuel<br>
to form a combustion mixture. The combustion mixture is compressed and<br>
ignited to drive pistons that are disposed within the cylinders. The pistons<br>
rotatably drive a crankshaft that transfers drive torque to a transmission and<br>
wheels.<br>
 A crankshaft signal is generated based on the rotation of the<br>
crankshaft. A control module determines an engine position and an engine<br>
speed from the crankshaft signal. Engine position and engine speed are used to<br>
control one or more subsystems within the vehicle. Disturbances in the<br>
crankshaft signal can cause inaccurate engine speed and engine position<br>
computations and therefore may cause one or more vehicle subsystems to<br>
operate inefficiently.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
 Accordingly, an engine system that compensates for<br>
disturbances in a crankshaft signal is provided. The system includes: an error<br>
module that computes an error between an ideal period and an actual period of a<br>
crankshaft signal; a correction factor module that determines a correction factor<br>
based on the error; and a compensation module that applies the correction factor<br>
to the actual period of the crankshaft signal.<br>
 In other features, a method of compensating for disturbances in<br>
a crankshaft signal is provided. The method includes: determining an actual<br>
period, an angular velocity, and an angular acceleration for K reference periods<br>
from a crankshaft position signal; computing an ideal period of rotation based on<br>
the actual period, the angular velocity, and the angular acceleration for the K<br>
reference periods; generating an error term for each of the K reference periods<br>
based on the ideal period and the corresponding actual period; and applying the<br>
error term to the corresponding actual period to compensate for disturbances in<br>
the crankshaft signal.<br>
 Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is<br><br>
drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16 regulates<br>
mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake manifold 14 is<br>
distributed into cylinders 18. Although four cylinders 18 are illustrated, it is<br>
appreciated that the engine can have a plurality of cylinders including, but not<br>
limited to, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders. It is also appreciated that the<br>
cylinders may be configured in an inline configuration (as shown) or v-shaped<br>
configuration.<br>
 A fuel injector (not shown) injects fuel that is combined with the<br>
air as it is drawn into the cylinder 18 through an intake port. An intake valve 22<br>
selectively opens and closes to enable the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder<br>
18. The intake valve position is regulated by an intake camshaft 24. A piston<br>
(not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture within the cylinder 18. A spark plug<br>
26 initiates combustion of the air/fuel mixture, driving the piston in the cylinder<br>
18. The piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque.<br>
Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 18 is forced out through an exhaust<br>
manifold 28 when an exhaust valve 30 is in an open position. The exhaust valve<br>
position is regulated by an exhaust camshaft 32. The exhaust is treated in an<br>
exhaust system. Although single intake and exhaust valves 22,30 are illustrated,<br>
it can be appreciated that the engine 12 can include multiple intake and exhaust<br>
valves 22,30 per cylinder 18.<br>
 The exhaust camshaft 32 and the intake camshaft 24 are<br>
coupled to the crankshaft (not shown) via sprockets and a timing chain (not<br>
shown). The engine system 10 outputs a crankshaft signal 34 to a control<br><br>
module 40. Based on the crankshaft signal, the control module determines an<br>
engine speed in revolutions per minute (RPM). The crankshaft signal 34 is<br>
generated by sensing the rotation of a wheel 36 coupled to the crankshaft. The<br>
wheel 36 includes a plurality of equidistantly spaced teeth. A wheel sensor 38<br>
senses the teeth of the wheel and generates the crankshaft signal 34 in a<br>
periodic form. The control module 40 decodes the crankshaft signal 34 to a<br>
specific tooth number of the wheel 36. Crankshaft position is determined from<br>
the decoded tooth number of the wheel 36. Engine speed is determined from the<br>
amount of time it takes for one tooth to complete a rotation.<br>
 More specifically, an exemplary wheel applied to an eight<br>
cylinder v-shaped engine is shown in Figure 2. Fifty-eight teeth are spaced<br>
equidistant along the outer circumference of the wheel 36. A gap 50 between<br>
two of the fifty-eight teeth serves as a rotational reference point for the sensor 38.<br>
More specifically, the gap 50 can be associated with a rotational position of the<br>
crankshaft relative to a position of a piston within a cylinder. For example, the<br>
low to high transition 52 within the gap 50 can indicate that a particular piston is<br>
at top dead center (TDC) within the respected cylinder.<br>
 Each tooth corresponds to six degrees of rotation of the<br>
crankshaft. Reference periods 54-60 are created for predefined reference angles<br>
(0) with respect to three hundred and sixty degrees of the wheel 36. The number<br>
of reference periods 54-60 in a single rotation can be determined by dividing the<br>
number of cylinders in the engine by two. As shown in Figure 2, four reference<br>
periods of ninety degrees are created for an eight cylinder engine. The reference<br><br>
periods are marked by reference teeth 62-68. An actual period (tAcTUAL)<br>
corresponding to a specific reference period can be determined by monitoring the<br>
time at which the crankshaft and thus the wheei rotates through the reference<br>
angle (0).<br>
 In an ideal scenario, the crankshaft signal would experience no<br>
disturbances. Each period under ideal conditions (tIDEAL) would be identical.<br>
Therefore, engine speed throughout the complete rotation would remain<br>
constant. However, disturbances in the crankshaft signal can cause faulty times.<br>
Various conditions can cause disturbances in the crankshaft signal. For<br>
example, a flawed tooth as shown at 70 typically causes a corresponding faulty<br>
period that deviates from an ideal period. The reference angles near the flawed<br>
tooth are adjusted as shown at 72 and 74 based on the flaw. Accordingly,<br>
engine speed computations based on the flawed times are inaccurate. By<br>
identifying and correcting the flawed times, a more accurate engine speed value<br>
can be achieved. It is appreciated that the crankshaft signal disturbance<br>
compensation method of the present disclosure is applicable to compensate the<br>
crankshaft signal for various types of disturbances.<br>
 The control module corrects a faulty period by learning the error<br>
(tERROR) between the ideal period (tIDEAL) and the actual period (tAcTUAL)- As<br>
stated earlier, the ideal period (tIDEAL) is a period over which the crankshaft would<br>
rotate a given angle (8) without experiencing any disturbances. The ideal period<br>
(tIDEAL) is based on an average of actual periods (tAvG_ACTUAL), an average angular<br>
velocity (VAVERGE), and an average angular acceleration (aAvERGE)- The error<br><br>
the signal. A compensated crankshaft signal 94 is output by the compensation<br>
module 84 to be used by other sub-modules within the control module 40.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 4, a method of compensating for<br>
disturbances in the crank signal is shown. The method may be run at any time<br>
during engine operation. In various embodiments, the method may be<br>
specifically run after the engine speed is brought to a particular RPM and fuel cut<br>
off takes place. This removes fuel disturbances. In this case, the method is run<br>
while the engine is decelerating. In various embodiments, the method may be<br>
specifically run during engine steady state operation.<br>
 In Figure 4, control collects actual data for each reference angle<br>
at 100. In various embodiments, as shown in Figure 4, control collects the actual<br>
data for a predetermined number (k) of reference periods. The selected<br>
reference periods are centered around a compression event. The compression<br>
event includes two full rotations of the crankshaft. Thus, the predetermined<br>
number (k) for the example provided in Figure 2 would be eight. In Figure 5,<br>
control determines if the cylinder is starting a compression event at 200. If the<br>
compression event has not begun, control loops back and continues to monitor<br>
the cylinder events at 200. If the cylinder is starting the compression event at<br>
200, control initializes an index variable (x) at 210. If the index variable (x) is not<br>
equal to the predetermined number of reference angles (k) at 220, control<br>
collects the actual period (TACTUAL) for the reference angle (x) at 230.<br>
Control computes an actual angular velocity (VACTUAL) for the<br>
reference period (x) at 240 based on the following equation:<br><br>
(TERROR) is then used to determine a correction factor (tCORRECTION) which is then<br>
applied to the faulty period.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 3, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
embodiments of a crankshaft signal disturbance compensation system that may<br>
be embedded within the control module 40. Various embodiments of crankshaft<br>
signal disturbance compensation systems according to the present disclosure<br>
may include any number of sub-modules embedded within the control module<br>
40. The sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned to<br>
similarly compensate for disturbances in the crankshaft signal.<br>
In various embodiments, the control module 40 of Figure 3<br>
includes an error module 80, a correction factor module 82, and a compensation<br>
module 84. The error module 80 receives as input the crankshaft signal 34.<br>
From the crankshaft signal 34, the error module 80 computes one or more actual<br>
periods 88. From the actual periods 88, an ideal period is determined. For each<br>
actual period 88, the error module 80 outputs an error 90 based on a difference<br>
between the actual period 88 and the ideal period. The correction factor module<br>
82 receives as input the errors 90 and the actual periods 88. Based on each<br>
error 90 a correction factor is determined for each actual period 88. The<br>
correction factor 92 can be stored in a datastore (not shown) of the control<br>
module 40. The compensation module 84 receives as input the correction<br>
factors 92 and the actual periods 88. For each actual period 88, the correction<br>
factor 92 is applied to the actual period 88 to compensate for the disturbance in<br><br><br>
At 250, control computes an actual angular acceleration (aAcTUAL.) for the<br>
reference period (x) based on the following equation:<br><br>
Control increments the index variable (x) at 260. Control loops back and<br>
continues to collect the actual data for each reference period (x) within the<br>
compression event.<br>
 Referring back to Figure 4, control computes averages of the<br>
actual data at 110. An average period (t.AVG_ACTUAL) of the number (k) of actual<br>
periods (tAcTUAL) is computed based on the following equation;<br><br>
An average angular velocity (VAVERAGE) of the predetermined number (k) of<br>
reference periods of actual velocities (VACTUAL) can be computed according to the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
An average angular acceleration (aAVERAGE) of the predetermined number (k) of<br>
reference periods of actual angular accelerations (aAcTUAL) is computed<br>
according to the following equation:<br><br>
As can be appreciated, in various embodiments to minimize computational error<br>
due to noise in the signal, the average angular acceleration (aAVERAGE) can be<br><br>
computed based on angular acceleration (aAcTUAL)- Where the angular<br>
acceleration (aAcTUAL) is computed based on average velocity (VAVERAGE)-<br>
 At 120, control determines the ideal period (TIDEAL) based on the<br>
angular velocity (v) and the angular acceleration (a) and provided the position<br>
equation:<br><br>
Substituting the above computed values into the position equation yields:<br><br>
Where tINITIAL and V!NITIAL are equal to the initial measured period tAcTUAL(0) and<br>
the initial computed angular velocity VACTUAL(0) respectively. Note that the<br>
angular velocity and the angular acceleration can be assumed to be constant for<br>
each reference angle (x) of the total reference angles (k) to attain an ideal<br>
representation of engine behavior. Therefore the average angular velocity<br>
(VAVERAGE) and/or the average angular acceleration (aAVERAGE) can be used in<br>
equation (7). The average period (taVerage) is determined by computing an<br>
average of successive samples of t shown as:<br><br><br>
 To reduce computational throughput, the above referenced<br>
mathematical computation equations (7) and (8) are combined to give (TDEAL).<br>
and can be simplified as:<br><br>
Where the coefficients (A) and (B) are predetermined values based on the<br>
predetermined number of reference periods (k). Fore example, the value of the<br>
coefficient (A) can be predetermined based on the following equation:<br><br>
The value of the coefficient (B) can be predetermined based on the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
This pre-computation can be implemented as an alternative to equations (7) and<br>
(8).<br>
 At 130, a correction factor ^CORRECTION) is determined based on<br>
the error in each reference period (x). The error TERROR) is defined as the<br>
difference between the ideal period (tIDEAL) and the actual period (tAcTUAL):<br><br>
The correction factor for each reference period is determined by the following<br>
equation:<br><br><br>
 At 140, control stores each correction factor (tCORRECTION) in<br>
memory. In various embodiments, the correction factor (tCORRECTION) is stored in<br>
a two dimensional lookup table with engine speed and cylinder ID as the indices.<br>
The stored correction factors can be later retrieved to correct the faulty period by<br>
multiplying the faulty period by the correction factor.<br>
 Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
