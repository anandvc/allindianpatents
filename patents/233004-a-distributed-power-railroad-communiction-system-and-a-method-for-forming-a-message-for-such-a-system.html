				<td>SIGNAL ERROR DETECTION IN RAILROAD COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
This invention claims priority to the provisional patent application filed on October<br>
17, 2001 and assigned application number 60/329,984.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to railroad communication systems, and more<br>
particularly to error detection subsystems operative in conjunction with railroad<br>
communication systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Radio communication systems (of voice or data signals) for trains having a lead unit<br>
and one or more remote control units or groups of remote control units are known.<br>
This arrangement where the locomotives are distributed within the train consist is<br>
referred to as distributed power operation and thus the communication system is<br>
referred to as a distributed power communication system. Generally, the one or more<br>
remote units or groups of remote units are controlled by commands from the lead unit<br>
carried over the communication system. The radio communication channel also<br>
carries responses by the remote units to the lead unit commands. In addition, certain<br>
important alarm conditions in the remote units and operational parametric data are<br>
brought to the attention of the engineer in the lead unit to ensure accurate and safe<br>
train operation.<br>
Since many of the messages communicated between the lead and remote units in the<br>
moving train relate to proper traction and braking commands, they must be reliably<br>
and accurately received, even under a variety of changing operational and<br>
environmental conditions that affect the reliability of the communication link. Also,<br>
accuracy and reliability are required for signals communicated between the train and<br>
various land-based sites, such as a dispatching center, a locomotive monitoring and<br>
diagnostic center, personnel in a rail yard or in a loading/unloading facility and<br>
wayside equipment.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates a train 18 and a distributed power communication<br>
system 10 for carrying control and monitoring signals between one or more remote<br>
units 12 and 13 and a lead unit 14 (Figure 1). In another embodiment, not shown, the<br>
function performed by the lead unit 14 is replaced by a control tower where<br>
commands are issued (directly of via the lead unit) by a dispatcher to all locomotives<br>
in the train consist. An off-board repeater 26 may be disposed within radio<br>
communication distance of the train 18 for relaying communication signals<br>
transmitted between the lead unit 14 and the remote units 12 and 13 when direct<br>
communication between the lead unit 14 and the remote units is hampered, such as<br>
while the train 18 is traveling through a tunnel. The lead unit 14, the remote units 12<br>
and 13, the off-board repeater 26 and the control tower (not shown) are provided with<br>
a transceiver 28 (and an antenna 29) for receiving and transmitting the communication<br>
signals. The lead unit transceiver 28 is associated with a lead controller 30 for issuing<br>
commands to control the remote units 12 and 13 and for responding to incoming<br>
signals from the remote units 12 and 13. Each of the remote units 12 and 13 and the<br>
off-board repeater 26 includes a remote controller 32 responsive to a signal from the<br>
transceiver 28 of the lead unit 14 for responding to the lead unit commands. The<br>
controller 32 can also initiate the transmission of messages to the lead unit 14 to<br>
advise of status information and alarm conditions.<br>
In one embodiment of the existing railroad communication system, the<br>
communication link is a single half-duplex communication channel with a three KHz<br>
bandwidth. Each message transmission comprises a serial bit stream code word,<br>
further comprising information bits and error detecting bits derived from a<br>
geometrical error detecting scheme, modulating a carrier signal according to known<br>
frequency-shift keying modulation techniques. The types, contents and format of the<br>
various messages carried over the communication system 10 are described in detail in<br>
the commonly owned United States Patent Nos. 5,039,038 and 4,582,580, both<br>
entitled Railroad Communication System, which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The system elements and message formats were intended to provide a secure<br>
transmission link for the information signals, with a low probability of accepting a<br>
message corrupted during transmission. The system also was intended to offer a low<br><br>
probability of interference from other lead and remote units on the same radio channel<br>
and within radio transmission distance.<br>
The train 18 further includes a plurality of cars 20 that separate the lead unit 14 from<br>
the remote units 12 and 13. The cars 20 are coupled by a brake pipe 22 that signals a<br>
brake application in response to a drop in brake pipe pressure and a brake release in<br>
response to a pressure increase. The pressure in the brake pipe is controlled by an air<br>
brake controller 24 in the lead unit 14 and any or all of the remote units 12 and 13.<br>
Each message includes information bytes or words and error detecting bits. As is<br>
known in the art, the inclusion of error detecting bits allows the receiver to detect bit<br>
errors that can occur during transmission over a noisy channel, at the expense of<br>
increasing the message overhead. In a prior art embodiment of the communication<br>
system 10, the error detecting bits are constructed in a geometrical format as<br>
horizontal and vertical parity bits. Each information byte is checked for odd or even<br>
parity, and as required an extra bit is added to satisfy the odd or even parity condition.<br>
This extra bit is referred to as a horizontal parity bit. Each message also includes a<br>
vertical parity byte that is generated to create a selectable odd or even parity for each<br>
column in the message, where the columns are formed by juxtaposing the words or<br>
bytes in overlying rows and determining the bit parity in each column. Once the<br>
parity of each column is determined, the vertical parity byte is formed to provide odd<br>
or even parity for the column.<br>
An example is shown in Figure 2 where the individual bits for information words A<br>
through D are set forth. These bits are merely illustrative and are not intended to<br>
represent a complete message carried over the communication system 10. Each word<br>
has eight information bits, labeled 0 through 7. The column labeled "HP" is the<br>
horizontal parity bit. In the example, odd parity is selected and therefore the value in<br>
the HP column is selected to ensure that an odd number of ones appear in each row, or<br>
that each of the bytes has odd parity. The vertical parity is established by the word in<br>
the "VP" row and in this example is selected to ensure that an even number of ones<br>
appear in each column.<br>
The horizontal and vertical parity bits are employed at the receiving unit of the<br>
communication system 10 to determine whether errors occurred in the message as it<br>
traversed the channel. Upon receipt of a message by the lead unit 14 or a remote unit<br>
12 or 13, the associated transceiver 28 demodulates the received signal into a<br>
baseband binary serial data stream and segregates the data stream into individual<br>
bytes. The applicable controller 30 or 32 determines the horizontal parity of the<br>
demodulated bytes as they are segregated. To determine the vertical parity, the bytes<br>
are arranged into a block form such as illustrated in Figure 2. (Note that the<br>
formation of the code block of Figure 2 is merely illustrative. It is not necessary to<br>
construct the block as the vertical parity can be determined by buffering individual<br>
bits such that buffered bits can be analyzed as though they were oriented in a column.)<br>
If the received words have the correct vertical and horizontal parity, the command or<br>
message represented by the baseband information segment is executed. If the parity is<br>
incorrect, the receiving unit rejects the message and a response is not transmitted. If<br>
the initiating lead unit (or the tower) does not receive a valid response from each unit<br>
to which the message was targeted, the message is retransmitted. At the receiving<br>
unit the retransmitted message is again demodulated and processed through the error<br>
detecting steps.<br>
During most communication intervals the train is in motion. Thus the communication<br>
link can be lost or degraded when man-made or natural structures interfere with the<br>
communication path between the transmitting and receiving units as the train<br>
traverses the track. Also, the communication signal can be disrupted when the line-<br>
of-sight is lost between the transmitting and receiving units. Such link disruptions can<br>
cause errors in the received message. It has been observed during operation of the<br>
prior art distributed power communication system as described above, that certain<br>
four-bit errors in the received message may not be detected. There is also a<br>
statistically significant probability of not detecting errors with more than four erred<br>
bits. If errors go undetected at the receiving unit, train operational problems may<br>
arise. For example, if the lead unit 14 transmits a brake application command to the<br>
remote units, and the command is corrupted during transmission, but the corruption<br>
created errors in an undetectable error pattern, then the command is interpreted as a<br>
valid command, but a brake application is not made at the remote units 12 and 13.<br>
An example of undetected errors that can occur with the prior art geometrical parity<br>
scheme is illustrated in Figure 3. One class of undetectable errors cause an even<br>
number of errors in an even number of rows, where the errors occur in the same<br>
columns within each row. For simplicity, Figure 3 illustrates only five rows of<br>
information words, each word comprising eight bits, plus a horizontal parity bit (HP)<br>
and a vertical parity bit (VP). Odd parity was selected. The erred bits are stricken<br>
and the value of the erred bit written above the strike mark. An error occurs when a<br>
transmitted zero bit is received as a one bit (or vice versa) due to noise and other<br>
channel effects. As can be seen by checking the parity of each row and column after<br>
occurrence of the indicated errors, the horizontal and vertical parity bits still indicate<br>
five correct information words, notwithstanding four erred bits. Such undetected<br>
errors can cause serious operational problems as the remote units 12 and 13 will not<br>
receive the correct command or data as transmitted from the lead unit 14, but are<br>
unable to determine that an error occurred.<br>
Implementation of additional error detection capability to reduce the bit error<br>
probability is constrained by the large number of operational locomotives (lead units<br>
14 and remote units 12 and 13) currently utilizing the prior art geometric parity<br>
scheme described above and the requirement that all locomotives in a fleet must be<br>
interoperable. The process of assembling a train having multiple locomotives so as to<br>
have sufficient motive power to meet the train's mission requirements is a complex<br>
one that would be made more difficult by the additional issue of locomotive<br>
communication system interoperability. Thus it is not possible to reduce the bit error<br>
rate by simply upgrading the communication system 10 of just isolated, individual<br>
locomotives to include one of the known more powerful error detecting methods, as<br>
the locomotives operating with the legacy geometric parity scheme would then not<br>
interoperate with the locomotives employing the newer error detecting scheme.<br>
Upgrading all locomotives throughout the entire North American railway network<br>
over a short period of time is problematic. Such a conversion would be a time-<br>
consuming, burdensome and expensive task in light of the large number of<br><br>
locomotives involved, their geographic dispersion and the various railroad company<br>
owners.<br>
The problem thus remains to provide an error detecting scheme that reduces the bit<br>
error rate below that provided with the existing geometric parity scheme, while<br>
providing interoperability with communication systems employing the existing<br>
geometric parity scheme.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To improve the error detecting capabilities of the distributed power communication<br>
system, the present invention teaches the use of additional error detection bits, that<br>
form part of the information to be transmitted and operable in combination with the<br>
existing geometric parity bits schemes. This enables the transmitted word to be<br>
decoded by a receiver having additional error detection capability with greater<br>
accuracy and reliability. At the same time, the additional error detection bits are<br>
ignored by a receiving unit that is not equipped to process the additional error<br>
detection bits. In a preferred embodiment, a cyclic redundancy code polynomial is<br>
used to provide the additional error detection bits.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before describing in detail the particular railroad communication system in<br>
accordance with the present invention, it should be observed that the present invention<br>
resides primarily in a novel combination of hardware elements and method steps<br>
related to data error detection. Accordingly, the hardware elements and method steps<br>
have been represented by conventional elements in the drawings, showing only those<br>
specific details that are pertinent to the present invention, so as not to obscure the<br>
disclosure with structural details that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
having the benefit of the description herein.<br>
To improve the error detection capabilities of the communication system 10<br>
associated with distributed operation of a railroad train, the geometric code described<br>
above is augmented with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code or a shortened cyclic<br>
code.<br>
The substantial improvement in the undetected error performance is due primarily to<br>
the different and independent schemes for developing the CRC and the geometrical<br>
error detecting bits. The two schemes are optimized to detect different patterns of<br>
data errors. The geometrical bits are constructed based on the parity of the message<br>
when arranged in a block, and thus certain errors go undetected as illustrated in Figure<br>
3 above. The CRC bits are formed from the remainder produced by dividing the<br>
shifted information bits by a code generator polynomial, such as one of the code<br>
generator polynomials set forth below. Thus the CRC bits detect the undetected<br>
errors illustrated in Figure 3. In one embodiment, the combination of the geometric<br>
error delecting bits and the CRC bits improves the error detecting capabilities by<br>
about six orders of magnitude over use of the geometric parity bits alone.<br>
Further, the additional error detecting bits generated by the CRC code are included<br>
within the information segment of the message, with the vertical and the horizontal<br>
parity bits "wrapped around" both the information bits and the CRC bits. Figure 4<br>
illustrates an exemplary message 40, including information bits 41 and CRC bits 42.<br>
Horizontal parity bits 43 are formed based on the parity of the rows of information<br>
bits 41 and CRC bits 42. Odd parity is selected for this example. Vertical parity bits<br>
45 (odd parity) are formed based on the columns of the information bits 41, the CRC<br>
bits 42 and the horizontal parity bits 43.<br>
Thus CRC-equipped locomotives utilize both the geometrical parity bits and the CRC<br>
bits to detect message errors. Non-CRC-equipped locomotives can use only the<br>
geometrical parity bits, ignoring the CRC bits as simply extraneous "information" bits<br>
that it does not need to process. Although the non-CRC equipped locomotives cannot<br>
take advantage of the additional error detecting capability within the message, they<br>
can detect errors based on geometric parity and thus can interoperate with the CRC-<br>
equipped locomotives (and other non-CRC-equipped locomotives).<br>
It is know that cyclic codes are based on a generator polynomial and that the degree of<br>
the polynomial equals the number of check bits included in the bit stream to provide<br>
the error detecting function. One exemplary generator polynomial appropriate for use<br>
with the distributed power communication system 10 is:<br>
g(X) = 1 + X2 + X15 + X16.<br>
Thus this generator polynomial produces 16 check bits to detect errors in the<br>
information bit stream. When a cyclic code generated according to the above<br>
generator polynomial is annexed to the geometrical code described above, there is a<br>
significant improvement in the undetected error rate performance. In another<br>
embodiment a code generator polynomial of the form<br>
g(X) = 1 + X5 + X12 + X16<br>
serves as the generator polynomial.<br>
According to one embodiment of the distributed power communication systems 10,<br>
the message transmitted over the link comprises a 20-32 byte information field plus a<br>
one-byte vertical parity word. The total code word is thus 21 to 33 bytes long.<br>
Assuming, for example, that a 21 byte code word is augmented with two cyclic<br>
redundancy check (CRC) code bytes of the present invention, then a transmitted code<br>
word comprises 18 information bytes (144 bits), one horizontal parity bit for each<br>
information byte (18 bits), 2 bytes (16 bits) of cyclic redundancy check bits, and 9 bits<br>
of vertical parity. The two CRC bytes check all of the information bytes and the<br>
horizontal parity bit associated with each information byte. The vertical parity byte<br>
checks the CRC bytes and the horizontal parity bytes. The total message size is 189<br>
bits with 45 parity bits. There are 29 geometric parity bits (nine vertical and 18<br>
horizontal) plus 16 CRC check bits.<br>
In a situation where the communication system 10 includes one CRC-capable and one<br>
non-CRC-capable locomotive, the CRC-capable locomotive uses 49 error detecting<br>
bits, i.e., the CRC bits, the horizontal parity bits and the vertical parity bits to perform<br>
error detection. The non-CRC-equipped locomotive uses only the vertical and the<br>
horizontal parity bits (29 bits) and ignores the CRC bits.<br>
In various embodiments, the order in which the two CRC check bytes, the horizontal<br>
parity bits and the vertical parity bits are formed can be interchanged. Thus according<br>
to one embodiment, the CRC check bytes are formed first, followed by the horizontal<br>
and then the vertical parity bits. In another embodiment, the CRC check bytes are<br>
formed first, followed by the vertical then the horizontal parity bits. In both such<br>
embodiments, the CRC check words are treated as part of the information, with<br>
respect to the later formation of the vertical and horizontal parity bits (in either order).<br>
Thus this technique is distinguished from the conventional error detecting scheme<br>
where the error control code words or bits are appended to the information bits, and<br>
treated as a separate entity for separate processing at the receiving site.<br>
The implementation of the CRC error-checking capabilities into all the distributed<br>
power communication systems operating on today's locomotives will take some time<br>
to complete. Since for a time there will be both non-CRC and CRC distributed power<br>
communication systems in operation, it is advisable, as discussed above, to develop<br>
an error detecting system that is interoperable with both CRC and non-CRC systems.<br>
As these legacy systems are upgraded or replaced, CRC error detecting capabilities<br>
can be incorporated. To allow this interoperability, the message format includes a bit<br>
for indicating whether a locomotive is CRC capable.<br>
When a communication session is initiated, the lead unit 14 indicates CRC-capability<br>
by setting a CRC-designating bit within the message and including the CRC code<br>
words in the message. If CRC processing is available at the receiving unit, that is,<br>
either one or both of the remote units 12 and 13, the CRC code words are used to<br>
detect errors in the received message. Also, the designating bit is set in the reply<br>
message and the reply message includes CRC code words generated as described<br>
above, i.e., the reply is CRC-capable.<br>
If the receiving unit is not CRC-capable, the CRC designating bit in the message from<br>
the lead unit 12 has no effect and is ignored, the CRC code bytes are ignored as the<br>
receiving unit decodes the received message and the receiving unit replies with a non-<br>
CRC reply, that is, where the CRC designating bit in the reply message is not set and<br>
no CRC code bytes appear in the reply message. The lack of a set bit in the reply<br>
message indicates to the lead unit 14 that the receiving unit is not CRC-capable and<br>
thus future messages to that receiving unit are not CRC-encoded. Advantageously,<br>
the error detecting scheme of the present invention where the CRC bits are treated as<br>
part of the data or information with respect to the later formation of the vertical and<br>
horizontal bits, allows the receiving unit to simply ignore the CRC code words, while<br>
continuing to use the horizontal and vertical parity bits for error detection.<br>
This arrangement permits non-CRC-capable locomotives to receive messages from<br>
CRC-capable locomotives and maintain the ability to perform error detecting on the<br>
received message using the horizontal and the vertical parity bits. Thus the non-CRC-<br>
capabje and the CRC-capable locomotives are interoperable, with error detection<br>
provided by the horizontal and vertical parity bits. Two CRC-capable locomotives<br>
can communicate with error detection provided by both the horizontal and vertical<br>
parity bits and by the CRC bits. The addition of the CRC bits to the message is<br>
backward compatible with messages that lack the CRC code bits.<br>
If the lead unit 14 is not CRC-capable, then the CRC designating bit is not set in the<br>
message and in response the remote units 12 and/or 13 reply with a non-CRC reply<br>
message. Even if the remote units 12 and/or 13 are CRC-capable, CRC operation is<br>
suppressed when communicating with a non-CRC lead unit 14.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates, in block diagram form, an encoder 50 for generating a message bit<br>
stream. Conventionally, the encoder 50 is one element of the control unit 30 or 32 in<br>
the lead unit 14 or the remote units 12 and 13, respectively. The encoder 50<br>
comprises a processing device performing all functions related to the formation of<br>
information bits, the CRC bits and the geometric parity bits, or a plurality of<br>
processing devices., each performing one of the listed functions. Further, the<br>
processing device can comprise a general purpose processing device programmed to<br>
perform the illustrated functions, as well as performing other functions within the<br>
control units 30 or 32. Alternatively, a special purpose processing device can be<br>
employed to provide the described functionality.<br>
With respect to Figure 5, the processing devices are referred to by their functional<br>
attributes. The information bytes are assembled in a buffer 52 as they are received<br>
from other components (not shown) of the lead unit 14 or the remote units 12 and 13,<br>
and input to a CRC code analyzer, 54 for generating the CRC code bits.. A vertical<br>
parity bit generator 56 receives the information bits and the CRC bits, for generating<br>
the vertical parity bits (odd or even) as described above. The resulting bits are input<br>
to a horizontal parity bit generator 58 for constructing the horizontal parity bits (odd<br>
or even). The output code word is input to the transceiver 28 for modulating a carrier<br>
that is transmitted to the receiving unit, that is, either or both of the remote units 12<br>
and 13 or the lead unit 14.<br>
Although the horizontal parity bit generator 58 is illustrated as a separate component<br>
of the encoder 50, in one embodiment this function is performed by hardware within<br>
the transceiver 28, e.g., by a universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) that<br>
converts the multiple parallel word bit streams of the message into a single serial bit<br>
stream for carrier modulation within the transceiver 28. During that conversion<br>
process the UART appends the horizontal parity bit.<br>
In another embodiment, the appending of the horizontal and vertical code words is<br>
reversed. That is, the information bytes and the CRC bytes are formed and a<br>
horizontal parity bit (odd or even) for each of these bytes is formed. The information<br>
and CRC bytes, together with the respective horizontal parity bit for each, are then<br>
figuratively arranged into the code block, as illustrated in matrix and the vertical<br>
parity of each matrix column is determined, after which the vertical parity bit is<br>
appended, as determined by whether odd or even vertical parity is selected.<br>
In any of the various embodiments presented herein the horizontal and vertical<br>
parities can be the same or different. That is both can be odd or even parity.<br>
Alternatively even parity can be selected for the horizontal parity with odd vertical<br>
parity, or vice versa.<br>
At the receiving site, error checking occurs in a decoder 60 depicted in the block<br>
diagram of Figure 6. The message is received and demodulated in the transceiver 28.<br>
The received bytes are input to a horizontal parity analyzer 62 where the horizontal<br>
parity of each byte is determined. The correct parity (either odd or even) for the bytes<br>
is known in advance. Thus the horizontal parity analyzer 62 determines whether the<br>
horizontal parity of each received byte is correct.<br>
Although the horizontal parity analyzer 62 is illustrated as a separate component of<br>
the decoder 60, in one embodiment the horizontal parity analysis process is performed<br>
within the UART of the transceiver 28 during the process of converting the received<br>
serial bit stream to a parallel bit stream of individual bytes.<br>
If the horizontal parity of the bytes is correct, the message is stored in a buffer 64.<br>
The individual words are accessed by a vertical parity, analyzer 66 to determine, the<br><br>
parity of each column and compare the result with the known correct vertical parity.<br>
If the vertical parity is correct, the bytes stored within the buffer 64 are accessed by a<br>
CRC code generator 68 and the CRC bits are generated in response to the received<br>
message. If the generated CRC bits match the received CRC bits, the received<br>
message has a very high probability of being free of errors. The message is then input<br>
to the control unit 30 or 32, as appropriate, for further processing consistent with the<br>
contents of the message.<br>
With respect to the alternative embodiment described above wherein the order of<br>
appending the horizontal and vertical parity bits is reversed (i.e., the horizontal parity<br>
bit first followed by the vertical parity bit) the order of parity checkipg at the<br>
receiving unit should accordingly be reversed.<br>
As an alternative to regenerating the CRC check bits using the generating polynomial<br>
and comparing the resultant CRC check bits with the received CRC check bits, it is<br>
known to determine the syndrome of the received check bits, where a non-zero<br>
syndrome indicates one or more errors in the received message.<br>
As described above, in certain operating situations, the lead unit 12 may not be able to<br>
communicate directly with one or more of the remote units 12 and 13, or vice versa.<br>
In this situation a repeater station 26 serves to receive and retransmit the message<br>
between the transmitting and the sending units. According to one embodiment of the<br>
communication system 10, the repeater station 26 sets a predetermined bit in the<br>
received code word to designate the message as a repeated message, then transmits<br>
the message. Thus the message received at the repeater is different than the message<br>
transmitted from the repeater. As a result, the repeater station 26 recalculates the<br>
vertical parity word and transmits the message with the set repeat bit and the<br>
recalculated vertical parity word. At the receiving unit (either the lead unit 14 or the<br>
remote units 12 and 13) the received vertical parity word is checked first. If correct,<br>
the receiving unit then resets the repeat bit prior to processing through the CRC code<br>
generator 68. This technique ensures that the use of the repeater station 26 does not<br>
thwart the function of the CRC bits.<br>
In certain other operational situations the message is repeated by the remote unit 12 or<br>
13, and a different bit in the message is set. The receiving unit handles these repeated<br>
messages in the same manner as if the message was repeated by the repeater station<br>
26 as described above.<br>
The use of the buffers 52 and 64 may not be required for all embodiments of the<br>
invention as certain parity generating and checking schemes can be executed "on the<br>
fly," that is, as the data bits are being processed, without the need to store the bits.<br>
Figure 7 is a flowchart of the error detecting code generating process executed at the<br>
transmitting unit, that is, either the lead unit 14, one or more of the remote units 12<br>
and 13 or a repeater unit. After the information bits of the message are generated by<br>
the appropriate controller 30 or 32, at a step 80 the CRC check bits are generated.<br>
The vertical parity bits are generated at a step 82 based on both the information bits<br>
and the CRC check bits. At a step 84, one horizontal parity bit is generated for each<br>
byte, including the information bytes, the CRC check bytes and the vertical parity<br>
bytes. A bit stream is formed from the individual bytes and modulates a carrier signal<br>
for transmission over the communication channel 10, as represented by a step 86. As<br>
described above, the order in which the horizontal and vertical parities are checked<br>
and the correct parity bit assigned can be reversed according to another embodiment<br>
of the invention.<br>
Figure 8 is a flowchart of the error detection code analysis process carried out at the<br>
receiving unit. The message is demodulated and the binary bit stream formed from<br>
the demodulated signal at a step 90. Either concurrently with or after the bit stream is<br>
segregated into individual bytes, the horizontal parity is analyzed at a decision step<br>
92. If the horizontal parity of one or more of the bytes is incorrect, the transmission is<br>
rejected as indicated at a step 94. If the horizontal parity is correct, processing<br>
continues to a decision step 96 where the vertical parity bits are checked. If the<br>
vertical parity is incorrect processing continues to the step 94. If the vertical parity is<br>
correct, then the CRC check bits are generated at a decision step 98 and compared<br>
with the received CRC check words. If the decision step 98 yields an affirmative<br>
answer, the received message is deemed correct and provided to the controller 30 or<br><br>
32 for execution. As described above, in another embodiment, the order of the<br>
horizontal and vertical parity checking can be switched.<br>
Although the invention has been described in conjunction with a communication<br>
channel between a lead locomotive and one or more remote locomotives in a<br>
distributed power train, the teachings can be applied to other communication<br>
channels. In particular in another railroad application the error coding techniques of<br>
the present invention can be applied to communication between a locomotive and<br>
wayside equipment, a locomotive monitoring and diagnostic center and equipment<br>
operated by personnel working in or around the rail yard.<br>
