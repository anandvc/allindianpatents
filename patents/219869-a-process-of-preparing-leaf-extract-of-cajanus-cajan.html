2.Clinical observation of the effect of capsule of leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.)Millsp on treating osteoporosis. Clinic information<br>
200 patients were chosen, in which there were 78 male and 122 female. 9 patients were 45-50 year old. 28 patients were 51-60 year old. 122 patients were 61-70 year old. 34 patients were 71 -80 year old. 7 patients were 81 -99 year old. Their average age was 65 year old. Their chief complaints included spontaneous ostealgia which occurred continually or occasionally in different degree. The patients usually had backache or pain in hip and knee joint, felt aching and weak in loin and knee. When tired, the above symptoms became heavier. The patients can not sit for a long time and were easy to be fatigue. Their activity was hindered and restricted. Even someone often need taking analgesic in order to relieve their pain, but the effect is not satisfied or the pain recurred after stopping administration. Their courses of treatment were within 3 months to 3.5 years and average course was 9 months. By physic examination, it was found that 127 patients had hump back or deformity of kyphosis in varying degree, 132 cases were accompanied with tenderness and percussion pain on vertebrae, percussion pain on hip and knee joint. By examination with X-ray, it was found that there were 112 cases with spinal compression fracture, 15 cases with hip fracture, 27 cases with wrist fracture, 5 cases with arm fracture, 6 cases with multiple fracture. All patients showed obvious symptom of osteoporosis such as low bone density .thin cortex of bone, slender and sparse bone trabecula without other possibility of pathologic fracture such as other disease or metastatic carcinoma. Method of treatment<br>
(l)General therapy: those who had slight compression fracture or center depressed compression fracture on spine needn't lie in bed. Those whose vertebral body was<br><br>
compressed about <l need lie in bed for two weeks. those whose vertebral body was compressed about>l/2 or many vertebral body was compressed to be deformed and had bad stability need lie in bed for 3-5 weeks. All of the patients need small pillows under the center of injured vertebrae so as to relieve deformity of ithycyphos in late time. Those who had hip fracture need therapy of bone traction or fixing with screw nail. Be careful to prevent from bed sore and infection in lung and urinary system during time of lying in bed.<br>
(2)Treatment with Shengmaichenggu Capsule by oral administration (3)Accessory therapy<br>
Patients are encouraged to maintain activity outdoor during middle and later period in order to increase bone stress stimulation, enhance the bone firm and tenacious so as to make bone strong and make joints agile. Don't let the patients do excising violently and carry heavy goods. Those who had fracture should combine other therapies, for example, infrared radiation, TDP lamp irradiation and fumigation with traditional Chinese medicine in order to promote healthy. Treatment result (l)Standard of evaluating curative effect<br>
Notable effect: It means that all clinical symptoms disappeared, normal activity functions were obtained, fracture was healed, or compress-deformed vertebral body recovered partly, and symptoms of osteoporosis are improved.<br>
Improved effect: A majority of clinical symptoms disappeared, fracture healed or heal was delayed, compression of vertebral body didn't become serious, symptoms of osteoporosis are improved or changed unclearly, daily activity can be restored; or main clinical symptoms disappeared, activity function improved obviously.<br>
Invalid : Main clinical symptoms, physical signs such as bone pain symptom, activity function and osteoprosis all were not improved or became serious. (2)Results of curative effect<br>
According to above standard of evaluating curative effect, results was that there were 89 cases with notable effect, 29 cases with improved effect and total improved effect rate was 85.5%after 2-5 month treatment. 63 of the patients were visited during 3-5 years, and non of them has fracture again and their body condition recovered very well. 38 patients who had suffered vertebral body compress fracture have restored the ability of labour.<br>

(2). Methods:<br>
The mice were divided into 6 groups randomly ,i.e. control group , modeled group, levamisole-treated group, and three Shengmaichenggu capsule-treated groups(dosages are shown in table 14 ). The modeled group, levamisole-treated group and three Shengmaichenggu capsule-treated groups were administered 0.3% prednisone acetate at a dosage of 0.2ml/10g body weight by gavage for continuous 7 days. Meanwhile administered different medicaments to these groups by gavage for continuous 20 days respectively. Administered distilled water to the control group by gavage in the same period . At the time of 30 minutes after administering on the day 20, injected Zhonghua china ink into tail vein at a dosage of O.Olml/lOg. At the 2th and 12th minute after injection, took 10 ul orbit blood and put into 3ml 0.1% Na2CC&gt;3 solution and shook up. Detected optical density(OD) by colorimetric analysis in 722-grating photometer( A =620). Calculated phagocytic index K and phagocytic index a according to the following equation:<br><br>
OD is the optical density of blood samples taken at different times, 1-i~TI is the difference between the two sampling times, W is body weight, WLS is the total weight of liver and spleen . for the results were made by statistical analysis. The animals were killed by dislocating cervical vertebra. The liver and spleen were weighted respectively. Determined the weight of immune organs of every mouse according to the immune organ weighting method. Calculated the immune organ index and made a statistical analysis for the result.

Table 15 shows the effect of Shengmaichenggu capsule on the immune organs of mouse.It can be seen that Shengmaichenggu capsule (Pulse-facilitation and bone-formation capsule) at both higher and middle dosage ,can improve the weight of thymus and spleen significantly   (PO.01   2$,   PO.001).   This   indicates   that   Shengmaichenggu   capsule (Pulse-facilitation  and  bone-formation capsule)  can  improve the  mouse  nonspecific immunological function and antagonise immunosuppression. 2.Experiment of the content of mouse hemolysin (1). Experimental materials<br>
Medicaments: Shengmaichenggu capsule; Levamisole , supplied by Guangdong Shiqi pharmaceutical manufactory , lot number: 950406; Prednisone acetate , supplied by Xianju pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Lot number: 950523; 5% Suspension of chicken red blood cells in physiological saline; 10% Complement (Physiological saline :Mouse serum =3:2) Animals: 60 NIH mice weighting 18-22g each mouse, including male and female by half and half, supplied by the animal feedlot of the Health Department of Guangdong Province, Certificate number: 96A03. (2)Experimental method<br>
The grouping and administering scheme was the same as that of the above-mentioned Experiment of nonspecific immunological functions. At the first day of administeration, injected 5% suspension of chicken red blood cells to abdominal cavity of mice at a dosage of 0.2 ml/one mouse. Seven days after immunization, took blood from eyeball and centrifuged. The serum was diluted 100 times with physiological saline. 1 ml of the diluted serum was mixed with 0.5ml of 5% suspension of chicken red blood cells and 0.5 ml of 10% complement. After incubation in an incubator at 37°C for 30 minutes , the reaction was terminated by putting the mixture into a 0°C refrigerator.<br>
The formulated test solution was centrifuged. Took the supernatant and detected optical density(OD) by colorimetric analysis in 722-grating photometer( A =620). Set up a control group free of serum and took the supernatant of the centrifuged test solution of this group as the "0" basis for colorimetric assay .Took "OD" as the index for quantifying the serum hemolysin and analysed the data statistically. (3). Experimental results<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From the experimental results shown in table 6, it can be seen that the "OD" values of the model group decrease significantly as compared with that of the control group(P0.001). This indicates that prednisone acetate can reduce the hemolysin content of mouse immunized by chicken blood cells. The "OD" values of Shengmaichenggu capsule-treated groups at middle and lower dosages increase significantly as compared with that of the model group(P0.05 or P0.01). This indicates that Shengmaichenggu capsule can increase the hemolysin content of mouse immunized by chicken blood cells when it is immunosuppressed by prednisone acetate and improve the mouse humoral immunological function and antagonise immunosuppression. 3.Cellular immunity test (1).

1.	Medicaments<br>
The leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp and the extract thereof; Shengji Ointment composed of   zinc oxide, borneol, massicot, phenol, vaselin, acidun boricum and the like, which was the experiential formulation for treating the wound infection for more than 30 years used by the arthrosteopedic surgery and the surgical department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University Of Traditional Chinese Medicine.<br>
2.	Standard<br>
(1) The standard of dividing the stages of bed sore: According to the standard of dividing and judging the stages of bed sore which was defined in the probative text book basic nursing for the national middle medicine schools.<br>
The first stage is the florid stage of blood stasis : Temporary blood circulatory disorder (reactive blood stasis ) appears when the local skin was pressed. The symptom is that the skin becomes red, swelling, ardent, and aching.<br>
The second stage is the stage of inflammatory infiltration: The red and swelling part infiltrates outward, expands, and transformates. The color of skin becomes black and the blebs appears on the surface. The patient felt pamful.<br>
The third stage is the stage of the superficial ulcer: The blebs are disrupted, the local site is infected, the superficial tissue necroses , and the ulcer is formed.<br>
The forth stage is the stage of necrotic ulcer: The necrotic tissue invaded the lower layer of cutis vera and muscal layer, ligament    becomes visible and there is more pus. The necrotic tissue is black, graveoleat and caducous. The infection expands toward peripheral and deep tissues, even to bones, which can seriously cause pyemia. (2)The method standard for calculating bed sore: 1) Area: The area is    calculated by the way of computing the area of the plane geometric graph. 2) Time index for bed sore<br>
healing : Time index for bed sore healing-(the area of bed sore x the course of bed sore)/ days for bed sore healing.<br>
(3)	The standard of evaluating the effect: 1) healing time: days from the day of initial<br>
administration to the day when the wound is cured completely. 2)healing standard:The<br>
wound surface was covered by endepidemis ,and the wound disappeared completely.<br>
(4)	The inclusion standard of cases: 1) Disease type: only the bed sore patients suffering<br>
from craniocerebral injury, lower extremities fracture and spinal colum injury with<br>
paraplegia are included. 2) Site: Only the cases of sacrococcygeal bed sore are included. 3)<br>
inclusion standard for dividing the bed sore stages: Patients whose symptoms met the<br>
requirements of standard 1), 2) and beyond bed sore' second period. 4) Age and sex:<br>
Patients who met the requirements of standard 1), 2) and 3) can be included in spite of their<br>
age and sex.<br>
(5)	The exclusion Standard of cases: The cases of infection of burn with ulcer or<br>
furunculous abscess and sacrococcygeal infections caused by tuberculosis and<br>
hemorrhoidal ulcer are excluded.<br>
3.	Therapeutic method<br>
(1) Cleaning the wound: Bed sore wound was cleaned according to its condition. After general disinfection, all the necrose and inactivate soft tissues and dead bones were eliminated until the staxis of soft tissues and the facies ossea occurred. Then the wound was washed with aquae hydrogenii dioxidi or Eusol and normal saline. (2)Changing the dressings: The surface of the cleaned wound was covered with the Shengji Ointment or the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof. Change the dressings once a day wherein the used drugs were removed and the new drugs were applied according to the general rules of changing the dressings. When there was new epidermis on the wound, the drugs were changed once every three to four days.<br>
4.	the general condition of the patients in the two groups<br>
(1)	The group of the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp and the extract thereof: 34 men<br>
and 16 women aged from 19 to 86. The maximum area of the bed sore was<br>
19cm12cm(Stage IV), the minimum was 2cm xlcm(Stage II) and the average was<br>
17.5cm2.<br>
(2)	The Shengji Ointment group : 22 men and 17 women aged from 19 to 90. The<br>
maximum area of the bed sore was 8cmx7cm(Stage IV), the minimum was<br>
2cmxlcm(Stage II) and the average area was 9.9 cm2.<br>
5.	the result:<br>
(1) the bed sore healing time of the two groups was contrasted<br>
As was showed in Tab. 18, the bed sore healing time of the group of the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof was 14 days (pO.Ol) less than that of the Shengji Ointment group. The difference was significant.<br>

 the contrasted <br>
It is the more scientific and accurate way to evaluate the effect of drugs by calculating the healing time as a control.    The larger the time index is, the more effective the drug is , and vice verse. The difference of the bed sore healing time index between the two groups was shown in Tab. 20 which suggested that the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof had reliable and excellent effect on bed sore.<br>
When the bone in the bed sore site is exposed in the clinic observation , administration of drugs made from Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof would make several small pannus appear on the exposed surface of the bone, which is then grown into granulation , and jointed into a flake together with the granulation which was grown from edge to the central, forming the new granulation tissue to cover the wound surface. However this phenomenon was not observed in the Shengji Ointment group, wherein the granulation tissue sprawled slowly from ambitus to the central and was hard to cover the bare bones, so it is necessary to chose other extracts for antibacterial effect. As indicated above, among cases using drugs made from leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof, the granulation tissue on bed sore wound surface formed faster and covered wound surface more quickly while wound secretion was relatively less. The leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof was also confirmed to have better antibacterial effect on staphylococcus aureus by in vitro antibacterial test, which was equal to that of gentamicin (plant paper test). And the animal test also proved its antibacterial effect on acute, subacute and chronic inflammation model. The adverse effect of the drug was never appeared during the clinical use and the patients were response well.<br>
Example 12. The clinical research of the effect of the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof on the infected wound caused by open fracture<br>
1.Clinical information<br>
18 cases were chosen aged from 14 to 70, wherein 6 cases suffered from wound, 7 cases experienced irnmoblization surgery after being wounded, 3 cases experienced amputation, and 2 cases suffered from gangrene dismemberment. Among them there were 8 cases with fracture at the position of lower 1/3 of the tibia and fibula. 2 cases with fracture at the upper 1/3 of the tibia and fibula, and 2 cases with fracture at the lower 1/3 of the femora. 2.therapeutic method<br>
Only the drugs made from leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp and the extract thereof were used to be spread on the surface of the wounded site for all the cases. The drug has a concentration of 1:2 (i.e. the aqueous solution with a concentration of 1:2 prepared by the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp and the extract thereof and the distilled water for<br>
injection), PH of 5.3,   and was packed in bottles after disinfection. The operation should meet asepsis requirement when changing used drugs with new drugs. The wound surface was sopped with a piece of carbasus which had been soaked in the drug solution before use, and covered and bandaged with vaseline carbasus and sterilized dressing. When the wound infection was obvious, the administration was carried out once a day; when the granulation tissue appeared and the exudatum was reduced, the administration was carried out twice a day;    when wound surface was covered by new granulation tissue completely, it was changed to use the mixed solution of gentamycin and normal saline to perform hydropathic compress. After three days, free skin grafting was operated with pieces of medium pachydema. Three days after operation, the Chinese herbs were continued to used for performing huyropathic compress until the wound was cured. 3.Observation items:<br>
In order to observe the change of the wound surface we took the dynamic color image during different time before and after the administration. The germiculture and the drug sensitivity test were carried out for the secretion on the wound surface ; The occurring time , developing rules and the growth condition of epithelial granulation tissue , the granulation islands, and the wound surface's healing time were observed. The histological inspection of granulation on the wounded surface was also observed. 4.the result<br>
In the clinical test, 15 cases' infection was controlled during 3 days, other 3 cases' infection would be controlled after extirpating dead bones caused by its long time infection with bones infection and bones necrosis. The exudatum was reduced quickly after the administration, and the granulation tissue occurred 2 to 5 days after the administration. It was scarlet and easy to bleed if touched. The granulation tissue could cover the wound surface when it extended to the edge skin of the wound. 5.conclusion<br>
The leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof had better anti-infective effect on clinical infected wound surface and could enhance the growth of the granulation tissue. It also increased the blood supply of the wound surface and accelerated the agglutination of the wound. Especially, it could make granulation tissue which was called bone granulation islands grow on the bone which was exposed to the wound surface<br>
Example 13. the effect of the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof on<br>
the healing of the open infected wound surface<br>
1. The effect of leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof on agglutination<br>
of open infected wound surface<br>
(1 )Experiment materials<br>
The solution of the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof with the concentration of 1:2 (i.e. the aqueous solution with the concentration of 1:2 prepared by the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp and the extract thereof and the distilled water for injection), PH 5.3,    which was packed in bottles after disinfection.<br>
The model of wound infection on the rabbits' two fore-legs was established as follow: 19 healthy rabbits with the body weight of 2-2.8kg were selected no matter what sexuality they were. The animal were divided into three groups to establish the model of the two fore-legs' open wound surface, then inoculated with bacterium. It was proved by pro-test that the infection of wound surface approached to the peak at 72 hours later after inoculation. (2)drug application<br>
The drug was applied on the surface of the infection, wherein the drug was applied<br><br>
twice a day for the first week, once a day from the second week to the time when the wound surface was substantially cured, and once every there days when the wound surface was substantially cured or cured completely. It should be ensured the applied dosage was the same. Furacilin was used as the control.<br>
(3)	the method for observing and evaluating indicators<br>
The determination was carried out once every three days by describing the edge of the wound surface during the time when the wound surface was formed, before and after the administration. The healing time of the wound surface was determined by statistically processing the curve graph for the area of the wound surface versus the time and the value of the area for every group at every time; and checking the wound epidermis and the granulation tissue and scar tissue both visually and by optical microscope<br>
(4)	the result of the test<br>
The renovating effect of the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp and the extract thereof on the wound surface was superior to that of control group after 9 days of administration. The eventual healing time of wound was about one week ahead of that of the control, which showed a significant difference (p
The leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp and the extract thereof have the effects of enhancing the growth of granulation tissue on the wound surface, increasing the blood supply of the wound surface, accelerating the agglutination of the wound, decreasing the formation of scar and improving the quality of agglutination of wound. 2. The anti-infection effect of Leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and extract thereof on open infected surface of wound<br>

Experimental example 14<br>
The curative effect observation of Leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and the extract<br>
thereof applying to 564 cases with infected surface wound.<br>
1.Clinical information<br>
Leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and the extract thereof was applied clinically to the diseases such as traumatic surface, infected surface of wound, burn infection, bedsore etc. in the past more than 6 years, and the curative effect of 564 cases was observed.<br>
2.	Experimental method<br>
The secretion of infected surface of wound was cultured for bacteria. Usually Bacillus proteus pyocyaneus, Bacillus coli, Staphylococcus albus, staphylococcus aureus Rosenbach, few Bacillus subtilis,Bacillus aerogenes are often applied. After the drugs made from Leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and the extract thereof were external applied on the infected surface of wound topically for 3-5 days, the secretion and odor reduced, putrilaginous tissue was dispelled fast, florid granulation surface of wound was appeared gradually. After the drugs of the invention was applied to the larger surface of wound for 2 weeks, the skin grafting can be conducted basically; skeletons were exposed,and granulation insulas were seen grown with Haversian system after administration, covered the surface of bone gradually ;muscle tendon parts must be moistened by applying drug liquid in order to avoid necrosing.<br>
3.	Conventional preparation<br>
(l)The fresh leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. were cleaned and soaked in l%o bromo-geramine for 20 minutes, air dried, then pounded, spread on the surface of the wound directly, or one layer gauze was spread on the surface of the wound, then the drug was spread on the gauze, and the drug liquid could permeate the gauze and act on the surface of the wound, and afterwards the wound was bundled with dressing at outside surface. (2) The surface of the wound was wetted with 200%o inspissant of leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and the extract thereof, the former method of (1) had better curative effect when both were compared. (3) The leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. were boiled in water to get liquid, then the surface of the wound was soaked with the liquid for about 30 minutes.<br>
4.	Results<br>
(l)The clinical effects of removing necrotic tissue and promoting tissue regeneration were observed for the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp. and the extract thereof when they were applied on the infected surface of wound.Generally when 3-5 days external application, or 1 to 2 weeks external application for the larger surface of wound after administration,the secretion reduced markedly, odor disappeared quickly and the curative effect is satisfied relatively.<br>
(2) After the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and the extract thereof were externally applied, the grown granulation became florid without little edema.The grown granulation with the drugs of the invention was more florid and vigorous than that grown after Eusol solution &gt; l%o rotten sodium phytate solution, normal saline etc. were externally applied. The effect of fresh leaves is better than the boiled liquid of the leaves.So it was considered<br><br>
that leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and the extract thereof not only have the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect, but also have the anti-inflammatory effect, probably they also have a nutrient factor of promoting cell growth. When the infected surface of wound after punctual skin grafting on burn wound was wetted with the solution made from leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L) Millsp. and the extract thereof, not noly the infection could be controlled, but also it could be observed that the grown rate of the grafted skin is faster than that of the grafted skin where the drug of the invention was not applied.<br>
(3) Usually it was relative difficult to treat the infection under the scab of burn wound, or the infection resulted from grafting skin, especially the infection of Bacillus aeruginosus after grafting skin. But when the 200% solution made of the leaves of Cajanus Cajan(L.) Millsp. and the extract thereof were used to moistened the infected wound which was exposed half, the effect was better than that of wet dressing with antibiotics. There is no worry of resistance resulted from antibiotic.<br>
