				<td>Sulfonyl — or stilfinylbenzoylguanidine derivatives<br>
The invention relates to ortho-substituted 4-<br>
sulfonyl- or 4-sulfinylbenzoylguanidine derivatives of<br>
the formula I<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 is A, CF3, CH2F, CHF2, C2F5, CN, NO2 or Hal,<br>
R2 is -SOn-R6, -SO2NR4R5, NO2 or CF3,<br>
R3 is H, Hal, A, OH, OA, CN, NO2, CF3, CH2F,<br>
CHF2, C2F5 or CH2CF3,<br>
R4 and R5 in each case independently of one another are<br>
H, A, cycloalkyl having 5 to 7 C atoms,<br>
cycloalkylmethyl having 4 to 8 C atoms, Ph or<br>
-CH2-Ph,<br>
or else<br>
R4 and R5 together are also alkylene having 4 to 5 C<br>
atoms, it also being possible for a CH2 group<br>
to be replaced by CO, 0, S, NH, N-A or<br>
N-CH2-Ph,<br>
R6 is A, Ph, Het or C3-C7-cycloalkyl,<br>
Het is a mono- or binuclear saturated,<br>
unsaturated or aromatic heterocycle having 1<br>
to 4 N, 0 and/or S atoms, bonded via N or C,<br>
which can be unsubstituted or mono-, di- or<br>
trisubstituted by Hal, SH, SA, NH2, NHA, NA2,<br>
CF3, A, OH, OA, CN, N02, NHA, NA2 and/or<br>
carbonyl oxygen,<br>
A is alkyl having 1 to 6 C atoms,<br>
Hal is F, Cl, Br or I,<br>
Ph is phenyl which is unsubstituted or mono-,<br>
di- or trisubstituted by A, OA, NR4R5, F, Cl,<br>
Br, I or CF3 and<br>
n is 1 or 2,<br>
and their physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
The invention was based on the object of<br>
finding novel compounds having useful properties, in<br>
particular those which can be used for the production<br>
of medicaments.<br>
It has been found that the compounds of the<br>
formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts<br>
have useful pharmacological properties together with<br>
good tolerability.<br>
The novel compounds are inhibitors of the<br>
cellular Na+/H+ antiporter compounds, i.e. active<br>
compounds which inhibit the Na+/H+ exchange mechanism of<br>
the cells (Düsing et al., Med. Klin. 87, 378-384<br>
(1992)) and which are thus good antiarrhythmics which<br>
are particularly suitable for the treatment of<br>
arrhythmias which occur as a result of oxygen<br>
deficiency.<br>
The best known active compound of the<br>
acylguanidines groups is amiloride. This substance,<br>
however, primarily exhibits a hypotensive and saluretic<br>
action which, in particular in the treatment of cardiac<br>
arrhythmias, is undesirable, while the antiarrhythmic<br>
properties are only very weakly pronounced.<br>
Moreover, structurally similar compounds are<br>
known, for example from EP 04 16 499.<br>
The invention relates to compounds of the<br>
formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
The substances according to the invention of<br>
the present application exhibit a good cardioprotective<br>
action and are therefore particularly suitable for<br>
infarct treatment, infarct prophlaxis and for the<br>
treatment of angina pectoris. The substances are<br>
furthermore effective against all pathological hypoxic<br>
and ischaemic damage, so that the primary or secondary<br>
illnesses caused thereby can be treated. The active<br>
compounds are also highly suitable for preventive<br>
applications.<br>
On account of the protective effects of these<br>
substances in pathological hypoxic or ischaemic<br>
situations, further application possibilities result<br>
thereform in surgical interventions for the protection<br>
of temporarily undersupplied organs, in organ<br>
transplantations for the protection of the removed<br>
organs, in angioplastic vascular or cardiac<br>
interventions, in ischaemias of the nervous system, in<br>
the therapy of states of shock and for the prevention<br>
of essential hypertension.<br>
The compounds can furthermore also be employed<br>
as therapeutics in disorders caused by cell<br>
proliferation, such as arteriosclerosis, diabetic late<br>
complications, carcinomatous disorders, fibrotic<br>
disorders, in particular of the lungs, liver and<br>
kidneys, and organ hypertrophies and hyperplasias. The<br>
substances are moreover suitable for diagnostic use for<br>
the recognition of illnesses which are accompanied by<br>
an increased activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter, e.g. in<br>
erythrocytes, platelets or leucocytes.<br>
The effects of the compounds can be determined<br>
with the aid of methods known per se, such as are<br>
indicated, for example, by N. Escobales and J. Figueroa<br>
in J. Membrane Biol. 120, 41-49 (1991) or by L.<br>
Counillon, W. Scholz, H.J. Lang and J. Pouyssegur in<br>
Mol. Pharmacol. 44, 1041-1045 (1993).<br>
Suitable experimental animals are, for example,<br>
mice, rats, guinea-pigs, dogs, cats, monkeys or pigs.<br>
The compounds can therefore be used in human<br>
and veterinary medicine as pharmaceutical active<br>
compounds. They can furthermore be used as<br>
intermediates for the preparation of further<br>
pharmaceutical active compounds.<br>

It generally applies that all radicals such as,<br>
for example, Het or Ph, which occur several times, can<br>
be identical or different, i.e. are independent of one<br>
another.<br>
The invention accordingly relates in particular<br>
to those compounds of the formula I in which at least<br>
one of the radicals mentioned has one of the preferred<br>
meanings indicated above. Some preferred groups of<br>
compounds can be expressed by the formulae Ia to Ih<br>
below, which correspond to the formula I and in which<br>
the radicals not described in greater detail have the<br>
meaning indicated in the formula I, but in which<br>
in Ia R1 is A and R2 is -SO2-A or N02;<br>
in Ib R1 is A and R6 is branched or unbranched alkyl<br>
having 1 to 6 C atoms;<br>
in Ic R1 is A and R6 is cycloalkyl having 5 to 7 C<br>
atoms;<br>
in Id R6 is branched or unbranched alkyl having 1-6<br>
C atoms, R2 is -SO2-A, CF3 or NO2 and R1 is<br>
methyl or ethyl;<br>
in Ie R6 is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl,<br>
butyl, cycloalkyl having 3 to 7 C atoms, or<br>
phenyl which is unsubstituted or<br>
monosubstituted by Cl, Br, methyl or CF3, and<br>
R2 is in the meta-position relative to the<br>
amide group and is -SO2-A;<br>
in If R1 and R2 are in the para-position to one<br>
another and R1 is A and R2 is -SO2-A;<br>
in Ig R6 is phenyl or methyl, n = 2, R1 is methyl or<br>
ethyl and R2 is in the meta-position relative<br>
to the amide group and is -SO2-A;<br>
in Ih R1 is methyl or ethyl, R2 is SO2-CH3 and R6 is<br>
methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, phenyl,<br>
cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl.<br>
All compounds mentioned in Ia-Ih in which, at<br>
the same time, n = 2 are furthermore particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process<br>
for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I<br>
according to Claim 1, and of their salts, characterized<br>
in that a compound of the formula II<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R6 and n have the meanings<br>
indicated before<br>
and<br>
Q is Cl, Br, OA, O-CO-A, O-CO-Ph, OH or another<br>
reactive esterified OH group or readily<br>
nucleophilically substitutable leaving group,<br>
is reacted with guanidine,<br>
or in that a benzoylguanidine of the formula III<br><br>
in which R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings indicated<br>
before,<br>
and<br>
R8 is F, Cl, Br, I or H,<br>
is reacted with a compound of the formula IV<br>
R6-SOn-X IV<br>
in which<br>
R6 has the indicated meaning and<br>
X is H, Cl, Br or I,<br>
in the presence of a catalyst, after prior metallation<br>
or tran^metallation,<br>
or in that, a benzoylguanidine of the formula V<br><br>
is reacted with a suitable oxidizing agent,<br>
or in that a compound otherwise corresponding to the<br>
formula I, but which instead of one or more hydrogen<br>
atoms contains one or more reducible groups and/or one<br>
or more additional C-C and/or C-N bonds, is treated<br>
with a reducing agent,<br>
or in that a compound otherwise corresponding to the<br>
formula I, but which instead of one or more hydrogen<br>
atoms contains one or more solvolyzable groups, is<br>
treated with a solvolyzing agent<br>
and/or in that a base of the formula I obtained is<br>
converted into one of its salts by treating with an<br>
acid.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are otherwise<br>
prepared by methods known per se, such as are described<br>
in the literature (e.g. in the standard works such as<br>
Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods<br>
of Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart;<br>
Organic Reactions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York;<br>
and in the patent application indicated above), namely<br>
under reaction conditions which are known and are<br>
suitable for the reactions mentioned. In this case use<br>
can also be made of variants which are known per se but<br>
not mentioned here in greater detail.<br>
If desired, the starting substances can also be<br>
formed in situ in such a way that they are not isolated<br>
from the reaction mixture, but are immediately reacted<br>
further to give the compounds of the formula I.<br>
Compounds of the formula I are preferably<br>
prepared by reacting an activated carboxylic acid<br>
derivative of the formula II, where Q is particularly<br>
preferably Cl or -O-CH3, with guanidine. Reaction<br>
variants are also particularly suitable in which the<br>
free carboxylic acid II (Q = OH) is reacted in a manner<br>
known per se to give the respective activated<br>
derivative and this is then reacted directly, without<br>
intermediate isolation, with guanidine. Methods in<br>
which intermediate isolation is unnecessary are, for<br>
example, activation with carbonyldiimidazole,<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or the Mukayama variant<br>
(Angew. Chem. 91, 788-812 (1979).<br>
The carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives of the formula II are generally known.<br>
They are prepared, in particular, from the<br>
corresponding halogen compounds by nucleophilic<br>
aromatic substitution. The exchange Hal?SR6 is<br>
preferably carried out at the acid stage. Reaction is<br>
then carried out with an oxidizing agent such as H2O2,<br>
peracetic acid, perbenzoic acid or sodium perborate.<br>
The carboxylic acids of the formula II or their<br>
derivatives are furthermore prepared by metallating<br>
suitable benzoic acid derivatives of the formula VI<br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3 and R8 have the meanings indicated<br>
and R is hydrogen or A,<br>
and then reacting with an alkylsulfonyl derivative of<br>
the formula IV. A suitable base for the metallation<br>
is, for example, lithium diisopropylamide.<br>
In the cross-couplings mentioned before, a<br>
carboxylic acid or an ester derivative of the formula<br>
VI in which R8 is Cl, Br or I is reacted with an<br>
organometallic alkyl compound, which is prepared in<br>
situ from a compound of the formula IV by metallation<br>
with a metallating reagent known per se, in the<br>
presence of a suitable metal catalyst, in particular<br>
one of those mentioned before.<br>
The reaction is carried out in analogy to the<br>
reaction of the compounds III and IV. It is described<br>
below.<br>
The reaction of a reactive carboxylic acid<br>
derivative of the formula II with guanidine is carried<br>
out in a manner known per se, preferably in a protic or<br>
aprotic polar or non-polar inert organic solvent.<br>
Suitable solvents are mentioned below for the<br>
reaction of the compounds III and IV. Particularly<br>
preferred solvents, however, are methanol, THF,<br>
dimethoxyethane, dioxane or mixtures which can be<br>
prepared therefrom, as well as water. Suitable<br>
reaction temperatures are, for example, temperatures<br>
between 20° and the boiling point of the solvent. The<br>
reaction times are between 5 min and 12 h. It is<br>
expedient to employ an acid scavenger in the reaction.<br>
All types of bases which do not interfere in the<br>
reaction itself are suitable for this purpose. The use<br>
of inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate or of<br>
organic bases such as triethylamine or pyridine or else<br>
an excess of guanidine, however, is particularly<br>
suitable.<br>
Compounds of the formula I according to Claim 1<br>
can furthermore be prepared by reacting a<br>
benzoylguanidine of the formula III with a compound of<br>
the formula IV. The starting substances of the formula<br>
III can be prepared in a simple manner by reaction of<br>
appropriately substituted benzoic acids or reactive<br>
acid derivatives which can be derived therefrom, such<br>
as, for example, acid halides, esters or anhydrides,<br>
with guanidine, under reaction conditions such as are<br>
known per se and generally customary for amide<br>
preparation. In turn, those reaction variants are<br>
particularly suitable such as have been indicated<br>
before for the reaction of compound II with guanidine.<br>
The compounds of the formula IV, like the<br>
methods for their preparation, are known per se. If<br>
they are not known, they can be prepared by the methods<br>
known per se.<br>
The preparation of the compound II and the<br>
reaction of the compound III with a compound of the<br>
formula IV is carried out in a manner known per se,<br>
preferably in a protic or aprotic polar inert organic<br>
solvent.<br>
In the preparation of II or in the reaction of<br>
III with IV, it is likewise expedient to work in the<br>
presence of a base or with an excess of the basic<br>
component. Suitable bases are preferably, for example,<br>
alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides,<br>
carbonates, alcoholates or organic bases such as<br>
triethylamine or pyridine, which are also used in an<br>
excess and can then simultaneously serve as a solvent.<br>
Suitable inert solvents are, in particular,<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-<br>
butanol or tert-butanol; ethers such as diethyl ether,<br>
diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane;<br>
glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol monomethyl or<br>
monoethyl ether (methylglycol or ethylglycol) , ethylene<br>
glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme); ketones such as<br>
acetone or butanone; nitriles such as acetonitrile;<br>
nitro compounds such as nitromethane or nitrobenzene;<br>
esters such as ethyl acetate; amides such as<br>
hexamethylphosphoramide; sulfoxides such as dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (DMSO); chlorinated hydrocarbons such as<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform, trichloroethylene, 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane or carbon tetrachloride; hydrocarbons<br>
such as benzene, toluene or xylene. Mixtures of these<br>
solvents with one another are additionally suitable.<br>
A particularly preferred procedure when<br>
reacting III with IV consists in suspending the<br>
corresponding benzoylguanidine in an inert solvent,<br>
such as, for example, toluene, treating with a Pd(II)<br>
catalyst and then adding dropwise the desired<br>
previously transmetallated compound, e.g. a Zn-<br>
alkylsulfonyl compound, of the formula IV.<br>
A further preferred variant for the preparation<br>
of compounds of the formula I consists in oxidizing a<br>
compound of the formula V to a sulfonyl compound using<br>
an oxidizing agent. Suitable oxidizing agents are, for<br>
example, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, perbenzoic<br>
acid or sodium perborate. The compounds of the formula<br>
V can be prepared, for example, from the corresponding<br>
halogen compounds by nucleophilic aromatic<br>
substitution, the halogen/SR6 exchange preferably<br>
taking place at the acid stage and a conversion into<br>
the benzoylguanidine then being performed.<br>
The sulfinylbenzoylguanidines of the formula I<br>
(n = 1) exist in racemic form and can be resolved into<br>
enantiomers. These compounds are included by the<br>
invention both as racemates, but also in<br>
enantiomerically pure form.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can furthermore<br>
be obtained by setting them free from their functional<br>
derivatives by solvolyis, in particular hydrolysis, or<br>
by hydrogenolysis.<br>
Preferred starting substances for solvolysis or<br>
hydrogenolysis are those which otherwise correspond to<br>
the formula I, but instead of one or more free amino<br>
and/or hydroxy groups contain corresponding protected<br>
amino and/or hydroxy groups, preferably those which<br>
instead of an H atom which is linked to an N atom carry<br>
an amino protective group, in particular those which<br>
instead of an HN group carry an R" -N group in which R"<br>
is an amino protective group, and/or those which<br>
instead of the H atom of a hydroxy group carry a<br>
hydroxy protective group, e.g. those which correspond<br>
to the formula I, but instead of an OH group carry an<br>
OR"" group, in which R"" is a hydroxy protective group.<br>
Two or more - identical or different<br>
protective amino and/or hydroxy groups can also be<br>
present in the molecule of the starting substance. If<br>
the protective groups present differ from one another,<br>
in many cases they can be removed selectively.<br>
The expression "amino protective group" is<br>
generally known and relates to groups which are<br>
suitable for protecting (for blocking) an amino group<br>
from chemical reactions, but which are easily removable<br>
after the desired chemical reaction has been carried<br>
out at another position in the molecule. Typical<br>
groups of this type are, in particular, unsubstituted<br>
or substituted acyl, aryl (e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenyl<br>
(DNP)), aralkoxymethyl (e.g. benzyloxymethyl (BOM)) or<br>
aralkyl groups (e.g. benzyl, 4-nitrobenzyl,<br>
triphenylmethyl). As the amino protective groups are<br>
removed after the desired reaction (or reaction<br>
sequence), their nature and size is otherwise not<br>
critical; however, those having 1-20, in particular 1-<br>
8, C atoms are preferred. The expression "acyl group"<br>
is to be interpreted in the widest sense in connection<br>
with the present process. It includes acyl groups<br>
derived from aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or<br>
heterocyclic carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids and<br>
also, in particular, alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl<br>
and especially aralkoxycarbonyl groups. Examples of<br>
acyl groups of this type are alkanoyl such as acetyl,<br>
propionyl, butyryl; aralkanoyl such as phenylacetyl;<br>
aroyl such as benzoyl or tolyl; aryloxyalkanoyl such as<br>
phenoxyacetyl; alkoxycarbonyl such as methoxycarbonyl,<br>
ethoxycarbonyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, iso-<br>
propoxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), 2-iodo-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl; aralkyloxycarbonyl such as benzyl-<br>
oxycarbonyl (CBZ), 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, 9-<br>
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC). Preferred amino<br>
protective groups are BOC, DNP and BOM, furthermore<br>
CBZ, benzyl and acetyl.<br>
The expression "hydroxy protective group" is<br>
likewise generally known and relates to groups which<br>
are suitable for protecting a hydroxy group from<br>
chemical reactions, but which are easily removable<br>
after the desired chemical reaction has been carried<br>
out at another position in the molecule. Typical of<br>
groups of this type are the abovementioned<br>
unsubstituted or substituted aryl, aralkyl or acyl<br>
groups, furthermore also alkyl groups. The nature and<br>
size of the hydroxy protective groups is not critical,<br>
as they are removed again after the desired chemical<br>
reaction or reaction sequence; groups having 1-20, in<br>
particular 1-10, C atoms are preferred. Examples of<br>
hydroxy protective groups are, inter alia, tert-butyl,<br>
benzyl, p-nitrobenzoyl, p-toluenesulfonyl and acetyl,<br>
benzyl and acetyl being particularly preferred.<br>
The functional derivatives of the compounds of<br>
the formula I to be used as starting substances can be<br>
prepared by customary methods, such as are described,<br>
for example, in the standard works and patent<br>
applications mentioned, e.g. by reaction of compounds<br>
which correspond to the formulae II and III, but where<br>
at least one of these compounds contains a protective<br>
group instead of an H atom.<br>
The liberation of the compounds of the formula<br>
I from their functional derivatives is carried out -<br>
depending on the protective group used - e.g. with<br>
strong acids, expediently with trifluoroacetic acid or<br>
perchloric acid, but also with other strong inorganic<br>
acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid,<br>
strong organic carboxylic acids such as trichloroacetic<br>
acid or sulfonic acids such as benzene- or p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid. The presence of an additional<br>
inert solvent is possible, but not always necessary.<br>
Suitable inert solvents are preferably organic,<br>
for example carboxylic acids such as acetic acid,<br>
ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane, amides<br>
such as dimethylformamide (DMF), halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, furthermore also<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol and<br>
also water. Mixtures of the abovementioned solvents<br>
are furthermore possible. Trifluoroacetic acid is<br>
preferably used in an excess without addition of a<br>
further solvent, perchloric acid in the form of a<br>
mixture of acetic acid and 70% perchloric acid in the<br>
ratio 9:1. The reaction temperatures for the cleavage<br>
are expediently between approximately 0 and<br>
approximately 50°; the reaction is preferably carried<br>
out between 15 and 30° (room temperature).<br>
The BOC group can be removed, for example,<br>
preferably using 40% trifluoroacetic acid in<br>
dichloromethane or using approximately 3 to 5 N HCl in<br>
dioxane at 15-60°, the FMOC group using an<br>
approximately 5-20% solution of dimethylamine,<br>
diethylamine or piperidine in DMF at 15-50°. Removal<br>
of the DNP group is also carried out, for example,<br>
using an approximately 3-10% solution of 2-mercapto-<br>
ethanol in DMF/water at 15-30°.<br>
Hydrogenolytically removable protective groups<br>
(e.g. BOM, CBZ or benzyl) can be removed, for example,<br>
by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a<br>
catalyst (e.g. of a noble metal catalyst such as<br>
palladium, expediently on a support such as carbon).<br>
Suitable solvents in this case are those indicated<br>
above, in particular, for example, alcohols such as<br>
methanol or ethanol or amides such as DMF. The<br>
hydrogenolysis is generally carried out at temperatures<br>
between approximately 0 and 100° and pressures between<br>
approximately 1 and 200 bar, preferably at 20-30° and<br>
1-10 bar. Hydrogenolysis of the CBZ group is readily<br>
carried out, for example, on 5-10% Pd-C in methanol at<br>
20-30° .<br>
A base of the formula I can furthermore be<br>
converted into the associated acid addition salt using<br>
an acid. Possible acids for this reaction are those<br>
which yield physiologically acceptable salts.<br>
Inorganic acids can thus be used, e.g. sulfuric acid,<br>
nitric acid, hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloric acid<br>
or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids such as<br>
orthophosphoric acid, sulfonic acid, furthermore<br>
organic acids, in particular aliphatic, alicyclic,<br>
araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic mono- or<br>
polybasic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids, e.g.<br>
formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid,<br>
diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid,<br>
pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid,<br>
tartaric acid, malic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic<br>
acid, 2- or 3-phenylpropionic acid, citric acid,<br>
gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, nicotinic acid,<br>
isonicotinic acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid,<br>
ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid,<br>
benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
naphthalenemono- and disulfonic acids, laurylsulfuric<br>
acid.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their<br>
physiologically acceptable salts can be used for the<br>
production of pharmaceutical preparations, in<br>
particular by a non-chemical route. In this context,<br>
they can be brought into a suitable dose form together<br>
with at least one solid, liquid and/or semi-liquid<br>
excipient or auxiliary and, if appropriate, in<br>
combination with one or more further active compounds.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to<br>
compositions, in particular pharmaceutical<br>
preparations, comprising at least one compound of the<br>
formula I and/or one of its physiologically acceptable<br>
salts.<br>
These preparations can be used as medicaments<br>
in human or veterinary medicine. Possible excipients<br>
are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable<br>
for enteral (e.g. oral), parenteral or topical<br>
application and do not react with the novel compounds,<br>
for example water, vegetable oils, benzylalcohols,<br>
polyethylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatin,<br>
carbohydrates such as lactose or starch, magnesium<br>
stearate, talc, lanolin and petroleum jelly. Tablets,<br>
coated tablets, capsules, syrups, juices or drops are<br>
used, in particular, for oral administration,<br>
suppositories are used for rectal administration,<br>
solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions,<br>
furthermore suspensions, emulsions or implants, are<br>
used for parenteral administration, and ointments,<br>
creams, pastes, lotions, gels, sprays, foams, aerosols,<br>
solutions (e.g. solutions in alcohol such as ethanol or<br>
isopropanol, acetonitrile, DMF, dimethylacetamide, 1,2-<br>
propanediol or mixtures thereof with one another and/or<br>
with water) or powders are used for topical<br>
application. The novel compounds can also be<br>
lyophilized and the lyophilisates obtained can be used,<br>
for example, for the production of injection<br>
preparations.<br>
Liposomal preparations are suitable, in<br>
particular for topical application. The preparations<br>
indicated can be sterilized and/or contain auxiliaries<br>
such as glidants, preservatives, stabilizers and/or<br>
wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for effecting the<br>
osmotic pressure, buffer substances, colorants,<br>
flavourings and/or aromatic substances. If desired,<br>
they can also contain one or more further active<br>
compounds, e.g. one or more vitamins.<br>
The compounds of the formula I and their<br>
physiologically acceptable salts can be administered to<br>
humans or animals, in particular mammals such as<br>
monkeys, dogs, cats, rats or mice, and used in the<br>
therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body and<br>
also in the control of illnesses, in particular in the<br>
therapy and/or prophylaxis of disorders of the<br>
cardiovascular system. They are therefore suitable for<br>
the treatment of arrhythmias, in particular if these<br>
are caused by oxygen deficiency, of angina pectoris,<br>
infarcts, ischaemias of the nervous system such as, for<br>
example, stroke or cerebral oedema, of states of shock<br>
and for preventive treatment.<br>
The substances can furthermore be employed as<br>
therapeutics in disorders in which cell proliferation<br>
plays a part, such as arteriosclerosis, diabetic late<br>
complications, carcinomatous disorders, fibroses and<br>
organ hypertrophies and hyperplasias, in particular in<br>
disorders of the prostate.<br>
In this case the substances according to the<br>
invention are generally administered in analogy to<br>
known antiarrhythmics, e.g. aprindine, preferably in<br>
dosages of between approximately 0.01 and 5 mg, in<br>
particular of between 0.02 and 0.5 mg per dose unit.<br>
The daily dose is preferably between approximately<br>
0.0001 and 0.1, in particular between 0.0003 and<br>
0.01 mg/kg, of body weight. The specific dose for each<br>
specific patient depends, however, on all sorts of<br>
factors, for example on the efficacy of the specific<br>
compound employed, on age, body weight, general state<br>
of health, sex, on the diet, on the time and route of<br>
administration, on the excretion rate, pharmaceutical<br>
substance combination and severity of the particular<br>
disorder to which the therapy relates. Oral<br>
administration is preferred.<br>
In the following Examples, "customary working<br>
up" means:<br>
If necessary, water is added, the mixture is<br>
acidified and extracted or washed with an organic<br>
solvent such as ethyl acetate, the organic phase is<br>
separated off, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and<br>
evaporated, and the residue is purified by<br>
chromatography and/or crystallization.<br>
Example 1<br>
900 mg of Na are dissolved in 3 0 ml of<br>
methanol, 3 g of guanidium chloride are added, and the<br>
mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 0 minutes<br>
and filtered. After removing the solvent and washing<br>
with toluene, the residue is taken up in 3 0 ml of<br>
ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and added to a<br>
solution of 1 g of 2-methyl-4,5-di(methylsulfonyl)-<br>
benzoyl chloride [obtainable by reaction of 2-methyl-4-<br>
chloro-5-methylsulfonylbenzoic acid with Na<br>
methylthiolate, subsequent oxidation with Na perborate,<br>
conversion into the acid chloride, e.g. with SOCl2] in<br>
4 0 ml of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether. The mixture<br>
is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and diluted<br>
with 100 ml of ice-water, and 10 ml of 1 N HCl solution<br>
are added. The mixture is then washed twice, in each<br>
case using 50 ml of ethyl acetate, and adjusted to a pH<br>
of 9. After customary working up and removal of the<br>
solvent, N-diaminomethylene-2-methyl-4,5-di(methyl-<br>
sulf onyl) benzamide, m.p. 238-240°, is obtained after<br>
recrystallizing from diethyl ether.<br>
