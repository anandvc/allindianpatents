				<td>METHOD FOR CIRCULAR GRINDING DURING PRODUCTION OF TOOLS MADE<br>
OF HARD METAL AND CIRCULAR GRINDING MACHINE FOR GRINDING<br>
CYLINDRICAL STARTING BODIES DURING THE PRODUCTION OF TOOLS MADE<br>
OF HARD METAL<br>
The invention relates to a method for circular grinding during the production of<br>
tools made of hard metal on a circular grinding machine that has a workpiece<br>
spindle head and a tailstock, whereby work commences using a round rod<br>
comprising a starting material.<br>
According to the prior art known from commercial practice, as a rule work<br>
commences starting with round rods made of sintered hard metal. These rods<br>
then have a grinding overmeasure for the shaft region and are cut to the<br>
necessary tool length, or the starting bodies are brought to the required shaft<br>
dimension for their entire length using so-called centerless grinding and are then<br>
cut into lengths. From the bar pieces that were cut into lengths individually, the<br>
tool is then produced from the whole by grinding. For this, the hard metal tools<br>
are received during grinding between hollow center punches, tips, or in a chuck.<br>
Grinding occurs either using the conventional grinding method or using the<br>
rough grinding method by means of diamond grinding wheels. In any<br>
case multiple instances of re-chucking are required because first the individual<br>
bar pieces are produced by grinding and cutting into lengths, where necessary in<br>
the reverse sequence as well, and then in subsequent grinding processes that<br>
take place on other machines the tool contours are ground and cutting,<br>
gradation, spiral cutting, and the like occur.<br><br>
The known methods in accordance with the prior art work satisfactorily, however<br>
they entail the risk of errors in the trueness of the run. These errors are related<br>
primarily to multiple instances of re-chucking. Even if work is performed with<br>
great attention to precision, such errors in the trueness of the run cannot always<br>
be avoided. They are entirely and unpleasantly noticeable on the finished tool.<br>
This is particularly true of high-speed processing, for instance in aircraft<br>
construction. In this case, cutting tools are used that work at speeds of 30,000<br>
to 60,000 rpms When processing the light metal parts that are widely used in<br>
aircraft construction, even the smallest error in the trueness of the run on the<br>
tool is disturbingly noticeable.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to improve the method known from the<br>
prior art such that errors in the trueness of the run are avoided with certainty<br>
and at comparable production costs.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the following method steps:<br>
a) Gripping the round rod, whose length is a multiple of the length of a<br>
single tool, in a chuck of the workpiece spindle head that when the chuck<br>
is<br><br>
released enables axial displacement of the round rod, whereby an end region of<br>
the round rod that projects out of the workpiece spindle head faces the tailstock;<br>
b)	Grinding at least one steady rest on the end region of the round<br>
rod that projects from the workpiece spindle head and placing the steady on the<br>
steady rest;<br>
c)	Grinding a first end-face taper on the end face of the round rod<br>
that faces the tailstock;<br>
d)	Secure-clamping fitting of the first end-face taper with a hollow<br>
center punch that is located on a sleeve of the tailstock;<br>
e)	Circular grinding of the end region of the round rod that projects<br>
from the workpiece spindle head over approximately the entire length that<br>
corresponds to the individual tool up to its circular-ground final contour;<br>
f)	Cutting off the thus finish-ground individual tool from the round<br>
rod;<br>
g)	Releasing the chuck of the workpiece spindle head, which to this<br>
point has remained clamped, moving the round rod in the workpiece spindle<br>
head in the direction of the tailstock, and then loading the chuck, whereby an<br>
additional end region of the round rod, which end region is to be processed,<br>
projects from the workpiece spindle head.<br>
According to the inventive method, thus "work is performed on the<br>
running rod". For this, the round rod that comprises sintered hard metal and<br><br>
that can fot instance have a length of 300 to 400 mm, is gradually moved<br>
through the chuck of the workpiece spindle head and securely clamped each<br>
time a specific end region of the round rod that approximately corresponds in<br>
length to the tool to be produced projects from the workpiece spindle head and<br>
faces the tailstock. The special feature of the inventive method is that the<br>
projecting end region, even while it is joined to the rest of the round rod, is<br>
ground down to its circular-ground final contour.. The circular-ground final<br>
contour of the hard metal tool to be produced is that contour of the finished tool<br>
that is to be produced by circular grinding. Then cutting, spiral cutting, and the<br>
like are performed on the tool in subsequent methods. Since the end region<br>
projecting from the workpiece spindle head can have a considerable length<br>
depending on the tool, it is necessary to grip it at its free end, which is another<br>
reason a very precise contour is required. Therefore in the inventive method<br>
initially at least one steady rest is ground onto the free projecting end region.<br>
Then, if the end region is supported by means of the at least one steady rest on<br>
one or a plurality of steadies, a first end-face taper can be ground with the<br>
required precision onto the end face of the round rod, that is, of its end region,<br>
that faces the tailstock. The end-face taper is then fitted in a securely clamped<br>
manner with a hollow center punch on a sleeve of the tailstock. The end region<br>
is now again gripped at its two ends without it having been necessary to release<br>
the first clamping in the workpiece spindle head. Circular grinding can again<br><br>
be performed with the required precision on the already described<br>
circular-ground final contour.<br>
Then the thus finish-ground individual tool is cut off from the round rod;<br>
the chuck of the workpiece spindle head, which to this point has remained<br>
clamped, is released, and the round rod is moved forward a bit in the released<br>
chuck in the direction of the tailstock, whereby another end region of the round<br>
rod that is to be processed projects from the workpiece spindle head.<br>
In the present context, the description of a "thus finish-ground individual<br>
tool" is somewhat different from fmish-grinding in the sense of finish-cut as<br>
opposed to rough-tinned. Nor does it mean that the hard metal tool to be<br>
produced must now be ready for use. On the contrary, here the term<br>
finish-ground merely means that the resulting hard metal tool is as finish-ground<br>
in its first clamping as is the object of the circular grinding, that is, just to its<br>
desired circular-ground final contour.<br>
The advantages of the inventive method are comprised above all in that<br>
multiple clamping is avoided. Thus re-chucking errors are avoided, and the<br>
result is the best circular trueness of the run results and shape and position<br>
tolerances relative to the shaft and cut part Despite higher acquisition costs for<br>
the circular grinding machine, the costs for the individual workpiece are<br>
reduced because the resulting tool is processed in a single machine from<br>
unmachined part to rough-finished part or even finished pan. Furthermore,<br><br>
through-times are reduced, and it is possible to react very rapidly to an order<br>
for a specific hard metal tool because the desired end regions can be cut off of<br>
the round rod in different lengths. Thus, finally, the stored inventory of<br>
semi-finished products can be reduced because production is flexible and rapid.<br>
One advantageous furthet development of the inventive method is<br>
comprised in that during circular grinding of the end region of the round rod<br>
that projects from the workpiece spindle head, the steady is retracted from the<br>
steady rest. The steady acts primarily to grind with the greatest possible<br>
precision the clamped end of the end region of the round rod that projects from<br>
the workpiece spindle head and that faces the tailstock. On the other hand, the<br>
grinding of the workpiece contour can occur without additional support from<br>
steadies, This simplifies processing, and it is possible to attain with nothing<br>
further a perfect surface of the circular-ground final contour.<br>
In the case of high demands in terms of precision, even for thin round<br>
rods, two steady rests can be ground axially spaced from one another on the end<br>
region of the round rod In many cases, that is, with shorter hard metal tools,<br>
only one steady rest will be adequate, however.<br>
Another advantageous embodiment of the inventive method is comprised<br>
in that the end region of the round rod that projects from the workpiece spindle<br>
head is separated from the remaining round rod after circular grinding in that<br><br>
with a single grinding wheel first with the round rod rotating a second end-face<br>
taper is ground on the end face of the thus finished tool that feces the workpiece<br>
spindle head and then after the grinding wheel has been retracted and amlly<br>
displaced relative to the round rod a separating cut leaving only a central<br>
connecting band is applied and finally after the rotational movement of the<br>
round rod has ceased the separation process is concluded by grinding off the<br>
connecting band.<br>
Using this approach, the projecting end region of the round rod remains<br>
joined to the rest of the round rod until the last possible moment, namely, via<br>
the central connecting band. Thus two-sided clamping of the end region<br>
without repeated re-chucking is possible until the very end, and processing<br>
accuracy is further enhanced without additional complexity. Furthermore,<br>
giinding can proceed on the rotating round rod for as long as possible, which is<br>
advantageous for the thermal stress on the resulting tool.<br>
When the finish-ground individual tool has been finally cut off, the<br>
tailstock and/or the sleeve are then retracted from the resulting finished tool,<br>
and it is held by a clamping unit. Once the separating process has concluded,<br>
the clamping unit can remove the thus finished tool from the machine and<br>
deposit it, further enhancing the efficiency of the method..<br>
The known circular grinding techniques can be used for the most<br>
important process of circular grinding in accordance with method step e) in<br><br>
claim 1 Thus the circular grinding can occur for producing the tool contour<br>
with a nanow grinding wheel in the rough grinding method and/or with a wide<br>
grinding wheel in a pendulum grinding method<br>
The inventive method can be performed both in a nearly manual<br>
procedure and in a highly automated design. In the latter case, care must be<br>
taken above all that the last rod piece to be processed is not gripped in the<br>
chuck of the workpiece spindle head with an axial extension that is not long<br>
enough. If this happens errors occur thar are due to poor trueness of the run as<br>
a result of the gripping length being too short. Incomplete chucking can lead to<br>
damage of the machine or even accidents if the proper care is not exercised. In<br>
order to prevent this, in accordance with another embodiment of the inventive<br>
method it is provided that the rest of the length of the round rod that remains<br>
available for moving the round rod through the chuck of the workpiece spindle<br>
head is checked at least during every chucking process and when it does not<br>
meet a certain minimum remaining length a signal is given and/or the circular<br>
grinding machine is stopped.<br>
In this manner the greatest possible safety is provided for the method.<br>
The invention also relates to a circular grinding machine for grinding<br>
cylindrical starting bodies during the production of tools made of hard metal, in<br>
particular for performing the method in accordance with any of claims 1<br>
through 7<br><br>
In accordance with claim 8, such an inventive machine is provided with<br>
a machine bed, with a grinding table that can travel on the machine bed and on<br>
which are arranged a workpiece spindle head and a tailstock, with a chuck on<br>
the workpiece spindle head that enables a round rod acting as a starting material<br>
to be moved through and chucked in different axial positions, with at least one<br>
steady arranged in the region between the workpiece spindle head and the<br>
tailstock and with a gripping unit ananged in the same region, whereby an end<br>
region of the round rod that has been moved through the chuck of the workpiece<br>
spindle head and securely clamped can additionally be held selectively by the<br>
tailstock and/or the steady and/or the gripping unit, and with at least one<br>
grinding spindle head with one or a plurality of grinding spindles and that can<br>
be used to position one or a plurality of different grinding wheels at the round<br>
rod.<br>
Thus, in the inventive machine in accordance with claim 8 a number of<br>
features cooperate such that the described advantages of the method can be<br>
attained. In addition to the chuck of the workpiece spindle head, which permits<br>
the round rod comprising hard metal to be moved through and gradually<br>
clamped, the numerous devices for supporting the projecting end region of the<br>
round rod are also necessary, that is, the tailstock, the one or a plurality of<br>
steadies, and selectively also the gripping unit. The cooperation of all of these<br><br>
individual parts is necessary in the prescribed sense so that the hard metal tools<br>
can be produced economically and yet with great precision.<br>
Fundamentally it is possible with the inventive circular grinding rnachine<br>
to make due with a single grinding wheel if it is caused to engage the round rod<br>
in an inclined position.<br>
In this manner the end-face taper can be applied to the two ends of the<br>
resulting tool, while when the grinding wheel and round rod are set parallel,<br>
circular grinding can be performed to the desired final contour, However, it is<br>
preferred when in accordance with one embodiment of the inventive circular<br>
giinding machine a grinding spindle head is provided that carries two grinding<br>
spindles and that can be pivoted about a pivot axis that is oriented perpendicular<br>
to a plane in which lies the common axis for workpiece spindle head, round<br>
rod, and tailstock.<br>
In this manner two different giinding spindles can be brought into the<br>
working position rapidly, each of these giinding spindles being able to cany a<br>
plurality of grinding wheels.<br>
Particularly preferred is the arrangement of a multiple giinding wheel in<br>
which two or more giinding wheels of differing diameter, differing width,<br>
and/or differing exterior contour are located immediately adjacent to one<br>
another on a common driven axis.<br><br>
In this manner a very specific grinding wheel that is specially embodied<br>
for a specific procedure is employed without interference from the grinding<br>
wheel located immediately adjacent thereto. For instance, of two adjacent<br>
individual wheels, the one can be embodied for circular grinding in the rough<br>
grinding method while the other, with a spherical grinding contour, grinds an<br>
end-face taper in the optimum manner..<br>
When there is a demand for greater numbers of these multiple grinding<br>
wheels, it can also be advantageous that the different grinding wheels are<br>
combined into a common grinding body. There is then an adapted shaped<br>
grinding body for which only a single carrier body is required.<br>
The inventive circular grinding machine can be advantageously provided<br>
with CNC control, which then largely automates the entire grinding procedure.<br>
Given the problems described in the foregoing because of which it is<br>
necessary especially in a highly automated procedure to automatically monitor<br>
the grinding procedure, in accordance with another advantageous embodiment,<br>
allocated to the chuck of the workpiece spindle head is a sensor that checks the<br>
remaining length of the round rod that is available for moving the round rod<br>
through the chuck, at least during every chucking procedure, and when a<br>
minimum lemarnmg length is not met provides a signal and/or stops the circular<br>
grinding machine.<br><br>
In such an embodiment a situation is avoided with certainty in which the<br>
last remaining piece of a round tod that does not have a clamping length that is<br>
long enough is ground, which can easily result in errors or even accidents.<br>
In addition, in the inventive circular grinding machine, a tailstock with a<br>
sleeve carrying a hollow center punch is used in an advantageous manner. A<br>
hollow center punch is particularly well suited for centering the end-face taper<br>
of a cylindrical part and securely receiving it.<br>
The inventive method and the inventive circular grinding machine are<br>
not only particularly well suited for grinding hard metal tools, but also for all<br>
workpieces with similarly borne contours and problems.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail in the following using the<br>
exemplary embodiments depicted in the figures. The following is illustrated in<br>
the figures:<br>

inventive method;<br>

round rod that projects from the workpiece spindle head.<br><br>

Fig. 6 schematically depicts the transition to circular grinding of the<br>

Fig. 7 illustrates two different hard metal tools in the condition of their<br>
circular-ground final contour.<br>
Fig. 1 is the simplified view from above of a grinding machine for<br>
performing the inventive method. The machine bed is labeled with the number<br>
1, and in the front region a grinding table 2 is placed on it. The grinding table<br>
2 can travel in the direction of the axis Z by means of a CNC control. Placed<br>
on the grinding table 2 on the left-hand side is a workpiece spindle head 3 that<br>
receives a chuck 4 that is driven rotationally by means of an electromotor (not<br>
shown). The chuck 4 can be seen at the front of the workpiece spindle head 3..<br>
It is used to grip the workpiece, in this case the round rod 6. The chuck 4 is<br>
embodied such that the round rod 6 can be moved through the chuck and<br>
securely clamped in the desired axial positions by means of the clamping jaws 5<br>
(Figure 2). Positioned opposite the workpiece spindle head 3 on the grinding<br>
table 2 is a tailstock 7 that receives a sleeve 8 that can travel in the axial<br>
direction. The arrow 9 indicates the sleeve movement. The exterior end of the<br><br>
sleeve 8 that faces the workpiece spindle head 3 is embodied as a hollow center<br>
punch 10 and receives the end of the round rod that is ground to an end-face<br>
taper.<br>
Two steadies are labeled 11 and 12 and they can be positioned for<br>
providing additional support at the end region of the round rod 6. The arrows<br>
13 and 14 in Figure 2 indicate the direction of movement of the steadies 11 and<br>
12.<br>
The round rod 6, the workpiece spindle head 3, the chuck 4, the sleeve<br>
8, and the tailstock 7 form a common center axis 15 that can also be called a<br>
common functional axis,<br>
Also in Fig. 1 there is a grinding spindle head 16 that carries a first<br>
gtinding spindle 17 and a second grinding spindle 18. The first grinding<br>
spindle 17 is fitted with a first grinding wheel 20 and the second grinding<br>
spindle 18 is fitted with a second grinding wheel 21, The grinding spindle head<br>
16 can be pivoted about a first pivot axis 19 that is oriented perpendicular to a<br>
plane in which lies the common axis 15 of the workpiece spindle head 3, round<br>
rod 6, and tailstock 7. As can be seen with nothing further from the illustration<br>
in accordance with Fig. 1, the first grinding wheel 20 or the second grinding<br>
wheel 21 can be selectively moved into the working position by pivoting the<br>
grinding spindle head 16 about the pivot axis 19. Moreover, the grinding<br>
spindle head 16 can also travel linearly in the direction of the X axis. The<br><br>
travel in the direction of the X axis is also CNC-controlled The grinding<br>
spindles 17 and 18 contain integrated electromotors that drive the grinding<br>
wheels 20, 21 rotationally.<br>
Additional details of the circular grinding machine illustrated in Fig. 1<br>
are found in Figs. 2 through 4..<br>
Thus in Fig. 2 the clamping jaws 5 of the chuck 4 can be seen that<br>
clamp the round rod 6 for the grinding procedure. As stated, the round rod 6<br>
can be moved through the chuck 4 and securely clamped in a selectable axial<br>
position. When this happens, an end region 23 of the round rod 6 projects out<br>
of the chuck 4 and the workpiece spindle head 3. The length of the end region<br>
23 is approximately equal to the length of the hard metal tool to be produced<br>
plus a certain clamping and processing length (see Fig. 5)..<br>
Fig. 5 also schematically illustrates a gripping unit 22 whose clamping<br>
parts 24 and 25 can grip and hold the end region 23 of the round rod from the<br>
outside. The arrows 26, 27 indicate the movement of the clamping parts 24, 25.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates how the first grinding spindle 17 of the grinding<br>
spindle head 16 travels into the working position. The first grinding wheel 20 is<br>
illustrated enlarged. It has a base body 28 with a larger axial extension and a<br>
narrow region 29 projecting radially therefrom, The narrow region 29 carries<br>
the grinding coating 30 that has a cylindrical contour. The grinding wheel 20 is<br><br>
for instance embodied as a diamond grinding wheel with a grinding coating that<br>
is approx,. 5 mm high.<br>
In contrast, in Fig. 3 the second grinding spindle 18 with the second<br>
grinding wheel 21 is in the working position. The second grinding wheel 22<br>
has a first individual wheel and a second individual wheel 32. The second<br>
grinding wheel can be embodied as a multiple grinding wheel. However, the<br>
two individual wheels 31 and 32 can also be called parts of a common grinding<br>
body with a single base body.. The grinding coatings of the two individual<br>
wheels 31 and 32 are labeled 33 and 34. The two individual wheels 31 and 32<br>
have a different axial thickness and are both fitted with conical grinding<br>
surfaces that have opposing inclines,,<br>
In accordance with the illustration in Fig. 5, as well, the second grinding<br>
spindle 18 with the second grinding wheel 21 is employed.<br>
The other machine parts that are illustrated in Figs. 2 through 5 have the<br>
previously mentioned reference numbers and are therefore not detailed<br>
individually.<br>
The grinding procedure to be performed on the grinding machine in<br>
accordance with Figures 1 through 6 occurs in the following manner:<br>
The starting material is the previously mentioned round rod 6 made of a<br>
sintered hard metal. Such a round rod, which can have for instance a length of<br>
300 to 400 mm, is moved through the chuck 4 of the workpiece spindle head 3<br><br>
until an end region 23 (Fig. 2) of the desired length projects from the chuck 4.<br>
In this position the clamping jaws 5 are moved against the round rod 6 so that<br>
the latter is securely clamped.<br>
Then the first grinding spindle 17 of the grinding spindle head 16 is<br>
brought into the working position, Thus a first steady rest 35 is ground into the<br>
end region 23 of the round rod 6 by means of the first grinding wheel 20 that is<br>
located on the first grinding spindle 17 and that is rotatingly driven. Then the<br>
first steady 11 is moved in the direction of the arrow 13 against the Hist steady<br>
rest 35 so that the end region 23 is securely supported during furthet grinding<br>
procedures.<br>
When necessary, a second steady rest 36 or additional steady rests can<br>
be ground into the end region 23 of the round rod 6. The second steady 12 is<br>
provided for this, for instance. During this, the steady rest 36, which is<br>
arranged closer to the chuck 4, is then ground first and then the steady rest 35 is<br>
ground.<br>
In accordance with the illustration in accordance with Fig. 3, both<br>
steadies 11 and 12 are placed against the associated steady rests 35, 36. The<br>
end region 23 is thus securely supported. Now the second grinding spindle 18<br>
with the second grinding wheel 21 is brought into the working position, Its first<br>
individual wheel 31 then grinds a first end-face taper 37 into the end face of the<br>
round rod 6, that is, its end region 23, that faces the tailstock 7. The first<br><br>
end-face taper 37 is dimensioned such that it fits into the hollow center punch<br>
10 of the sleeve 8 that is displaceably arranged in the direction of the arrow 9 in<br>
the tailstock 7.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the condition in which the free end of the end region 23<br>
with the first end-face tapei 37 is securely gripped in the hollow center punch<br>
10 Located in the working position again is the first grinding spindle 17 of the<br>
grinding spindle head 16, which is again positioned in the direction of the X<br>
axis at the end region 23 CNC controlled. At the same time, the grinding table<br>
2 travels CNC-conttolled in the direction of the Z axis. In this manner nearly<br>
the entire length of the end region 23 is circular ground in the rough-grinding<br>
procedure by means of the first grinding wheel 20. This means that this length<br>
is ground in a single procedure of the grinding wheel 20 on the end region 23.<br>
However, it is also possible to use a wider grinding wheel and to perform the<br>
procedure in the pendulum grinding method. In this case, there are then a<br>
plurality of radial positioning movements, and the longitudinal movement must<br>
be repeated multiple times until grinding overmeasure 38 is carried off and the<br>
desired surface condition of the end region 23 has been attained.<br>
Fig, 4 illustrates a condition in which the steadies 11 and 12 are also<br>
positioned against the end region 23 during this part of the procedure.<br>
However, this is by no means required. The use of the steadies 11 and 12 is<br>
primarily unavoidable when the first end-face taper 37 is being ground. In the<br><br>
following procedures, work can also be performed in that the steadies ate then<br>
retracted.<br>
The procedure of circular grinding illustrated in Fig, 4 is by no means<br>
limited solely to obtaining a continuously cylindrical contour of the desired<br>
surface quality. On the contrary, in this method step the entire circular-ground<br>
final contour of the resulting finished hard metal tool should be attained. That<br>
is, depending on the final contour of the tool, partial regions can already be<br>
ground out with cylindrical, tapered, or spherical contours in this stage of the<br>
method in which the end region 23 is still situated on the round rod. All<br>
contours that can be obtained by circular grinding are conceivable. This can<br>
also occur in that a set of grinding wheels with different contours are employed.<br>
This is not illustrated in Fig. 4, however<br>
Figure 7 illustrates examples of such circular-ground final contours.<br>
The end region 23 of the round rod 6 and thus the resulting hard metal<br>
tool ate therefore thus finish ground. The term "finish grinding" here does not<br>
mean finish grinding in the sense of smoothing as opposed to roughing, but<br>
rather the most final stage that can be attained for the resulting tool by circular<br>
grinding. Then cutting, spiral cutting, and the like must be performed in<br>
separate methods. First, however, it is necessary to separate the thus<br>
finish-ground tool from the round rod 6.<br><br>
The procedure is explained using Figures 5 and 5 a through 5c. The<br>
final region 23 of the round iod 6 is first still clamped at both ends, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 4. One or a plurality of steadies can be positioned at the<br>
end region 23; however, this is not required. Deviating from the illustration in<br>
accordance with Figure 4, the second grinding spindle 18 is brought into the<br>
working position in that the grinding spindle head 16 is pivoted about the pivot<br>
axis 19. Now the second individual wheel 32 of the second grinding wheel 21,<br>
which is a multiple grinding wheel and which has a larger diameter than the<br>
first individual wheel 31, is employed. The rotating second individual wheel 32<br>
is then positioned against the also rotating end region 23 of the round rod 6.<br>
This first positioning procedure is then interrupted as soon as the second<br>
individual wheel 32 has ground the second end-face taper 39 (Figure 5a).<br>
Then the second grinding wheel 21 is retracted from the end region 23<br>
of the round rod 6.. The round rod 6 and the second individual wheel 32 are<br>
mutually offset axially relative to one another The offset is approximately the<br>
thickness of the second individual wheel 32. Then the individual wheel 32 is<br>
again positioned against the end region 23 of the round rod 6 and this time<br>
effects a separating cut 40. The procedure is continued until the connection<br>
between the remaining residual length of the round rod 6 and its end region 23<br>
comprises only a narrow connecting band 41. Until this point the end region 23<br>
of the round rod 6 was clamped at its two ends and driven to rotate (Figure 5b).<br><br>
Then the rotational drive of the workpiece spindle head is stopped, and<br>
the tailstock 7 with the sleeve 8 is retracted from the clamping position. The<br>
end region 23 of the round rod 6 with the first end-face taper 37 is now free and<br>
is enclosed and securely held by the clamping parts 24, 25 of the gripping unit<br>
22 Further positioning of the second individual wheel 32 then continues the<br>
separating process and the connecting band 41 is also ground off (Figure 5c).<br>
The tool, which is finished in terms of circular grinding, is now separated from<br>
the remainder of the round rod 6 and thus finished. The resulting hard metal<br>
tool is held in the gripping unit 22 and is removed from the machine and<br>
deposited by it (see Figure 5).<br>
Then the round rod is again moved out of the chuck 4 a bit so that the<br>
next end region 23 can be processed (Figure 6)..<br>
Figure 7 illustrates two different hard metal tools in one stage as can be<br>
attained with the inventive method and the inventive circular grinding machine.<br>
The second end-face taper can be seen on the illustrated, thus finish-ground<br>
tools at their one end. The original cylindrical contour of the round rod 6 i$<br>
illustrated with the dashed lines, so that it can be seen how the desired<br>
circulat-ground final contour was obtained solely by circular' grinding. The<br>
figure makes it possible to see clearly that graduated cylindrical, tapered, or<br>
spherical contours can be obtained with nothing further. The special aspect of<br>
this is comprised in mat these numerous shapes were created, whereby at least<br><br>
at the one end a single clamping of the round rod forming the starting material<br>
was sufficient..<br>
It should be remarked that the performance of the method is not limited<br>
to the measures depicted in Figs. 1 through 5. It is even possible to make do<br>
with a single grinding wheel for all of the procedures when it is possible to<br>
position this grinding wheel in an inclined position against the round rod.<br>
