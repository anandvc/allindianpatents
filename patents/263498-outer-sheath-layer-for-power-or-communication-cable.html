				<td>Outer Sheath Layer for Power or Communication Cable<br>
The present invention concerns a power or communication cable<br>
comprising an outer sheath layer made of a polyethylene composition<br>
which comprises a base resin comprising two ethylene homo- or copolymer<br>
fractions. Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of such a<br>
composition for the production of the outer sheath layer of a cable.<br>
Cables, such as power or communication cables, usually comprise an inner<br>
core which comprises a conducting element, such as a metal wire or a glass<br>
fibre, and one or more outer layers for shielding and protecting purposes.<br>
The outermost of these layers having mainly protective purpose is usually<br>
referred to as outer sheath or outer jacket.<br>
It is known to produce outermost protective sheath layers from polymer<br>
compositions comprising mainly polyolefms, in particular polyethylenes.<br>
The diverse application fields for the various kinds of cables make it<br>
necessary that the outer jacket meets a number of requirements which at<br>
least partly are contradictory to each other.<br>
Among important properties of a cable jacket and a material used for<br>
production of a cable jacket are good processability, including good<br>
extrusion properties at a broad processing temperature window, and good<br>
mechanical properties, such as good resistance to environmental stress<br>
cracking ESCR, high mechanical strength, high surface finish and low<br>
shrinkage of the final cable jacket.<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a cable jacket<br>
made from a polyethylene composition having simultaneously the above-<br><br>
-2-<br>
mentioned properties, with a high flexibility combined with all above<br>
mentioned properties. In particular, the composition used for the jacket<br>
should show an improved processability so that a high production rate can<br>
be achieved, while yielding a cable jacket with good surface properties.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that such a jacket can be<br>
provided if a polyethylene composition is used for its production which has<br>
a very broad molecular weight distribution of higher than 14.<br>
The present invention thus provides a power or communications cable<br>
comprising an outer sheath layer made of a polyethylene composition<br>
comprising a base resin which comprises<br>
(A)	a first ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction, and<br>
(B)	a second ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction,<br>
wherein fraction (A) has a lower molecular weight than fraction (B), and<br>
the base resin has a molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn of more than 14.<br>
The outermost sheath layer of the cable of the invention can be processed<br>
more easily as compared to prior art materials while retaining at the same<br>
time good mechanical properties, in particular good surface appearance.<br>
The term "molecular weight" as used herein denotes the weight average<br>
molecular weight Mw. The melt flow rate MFR of a polymer may serve as a<br>
measure for the weight average molecular weight.<br>
The term "base resin" means the entirety of polymeric components in the<br>
polyethylene composition used for the outer sheath layer of the cable<br>
according to the invention, usually making up at least 90 wt% of the total<br>
composition.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Usuaily, a polyethylene composition comprising at least two polyethylene<br>
fractions, which have been produced under different polymerisation<br>
conditions resulting in different (weight average) molecular weights for the<br>
fractions, is referred to as "multimodal". The prefix "multi" relates to the<br>
number of different polymer fractions the composition is consisting of.<br>
Thus, for example, a composition consisting of two fractions only is called<br>
"bimodal".<br>
The form of the molecular weight distribution curve, i.e. the appearance of<br>
the graph of the polymer weight fraction as function of its molecular<br>
weight, of such a multimodal polyethylene will show two or more maxima<br>
or at least be distinctly broadened in comparison with the curves for the<br>
individual fractions.<br>
For example, if a polymer is produced in a sequential multistage process,<br>
utilising reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each<br>
reactor, or when a polymer is produced in a process comprising a single<br>
stage in which two or more different catalysts are used, the polymer<br>
fractions produced in the different reactors, or by the different catalysts,<br>
respectively, will each have their own molecular weight distribution and<br>
weight average molecular weight. When the molecular weight distribution<br>
curve of such a polymer is recorded, the individual curves from these<br>
fractions are superimposed into the molecular weight distribution curve for<br>
the total resulting polymer product, usually yielding a curve with two or<br>
more distinct maxima.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the base resin has a molecular weight<br>
distribution Mw/Mn of 23 or more, more preferably 25 or more, even more<br>
preferably 30 or more.<br><br>
-4-<br>
The base resin preferably has a MFR2 of 0.05 to 5 g/lOmin, more<br>

octene and 1-decadene.<br><br>
-5-<br>

90,000 g/mol, and most preferably is from 10,000 to 80,000 g/mol.<br>

more preferably of 0.05 to 0.3 g/lOmin.<br>
Further, fraction (B) preferably has a density of 0.880 to 0.930 g/cm , more<br>
preferably has a density of 0.890 to 0.920 g/cm3.<br>
Still further, fraction (B) preferably is a copolymer of ethylene with at least<br>

is selected from 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene and 1-octene.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the base resin further comprises<br>
(C) a third ethylene homo- or copolymer fraction<br>
in an amount of up to 20 wt% of the total base resin with a MFR2 of 0.1<br>
g/lOmin or lower.<br>
Preferably, the amount of fraction (C) is up to 15 wt%, , more preferred up<br>
to 10 wt% of the total base resin. In a preferred embodiment, fraction (C) is<br>
present in the base resin in an amount of 1 wt% to 5 wt%.<br>
Further, preferably fraction (C) is present in the base resin in an amount of<br>
at least 2 wt%, more preferably of at least 3 wt%.<br>
Preferably, fraction (C) has aMFR2i of less than 1 g/10 min.<br>
Fraction (C) preferably is an ethylene homopolymer.<br><br>
-6-<br>
Fraction (C) is preferably made in a previous step from (A) and (B) and<br>

The weight ratio of fractions (A):(B) in the base resin preferably is 30:70 to<br>
70:30, more preferably 40:60 to 60:40, even more preferably 45:55 to<br>
55:45.<br>
The base resin preferably has a density of lower than 960 kg/m3.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the base resin preferably is from<br>
100,000 g/mol to 2,000,000 g/mol.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the base resin consists of fraction (A), (B) and<br>
(C).<br>
In addition to the base resin, usual additives for utilization with<br>
polyolefins, such as pigments (for example carbon black), stabilizers<br>
(antioxidant agents), antacids and/or anti-UVs, antistatic agents and<br>
utilization agents (such as processing aid agents) may be present in the<br>
polyethylene composition. The additives can be added as a polyolefin<br>
masterbatch. Preferably, the amount of these additives is 10 wt% or below,<br>
further preferred 8 wt% or below, of the total composition.<br>
The polyethylene composition of the cable according to the invention<br>
preferably has a shear thinning index SHI(2.7/2io) of at least 5, more<br>
preferably at least 10, still more preferably at least 20 and most preferably<br>
at least 40.<br>
Furthermore, the polyethylene composition preferably has a shear thinning<br>
index SHI(2.7/2io) of 300 or less, more preferably 290 or less, still more<br>
preferably 220 or less and most preferably 200 or less.<br><br>
-7-<br>
The SHI is the ratio of the viscosity of the polyethylene composition at<br>
different shear stresses. In the present invention, the shear stresses at 2.7<br>
kPa and 210 kPa are used for calculating the SHI2.7/210 which may serve as a<br>
measure of the broadness of the molecular weight distribution.<br>
Furthermore, the polyethylene composition preferably has a viscosity at a<br>
shear stress of 2.7 kPa r)(2.7) of 10,000 to 500,000 Pas, more preferably of<br>
50,000 to 400,000 Pas, and most preferably of 75,000 to 350,000 Pas.<br>
The base resin of the polymer composition used for making the outermost<br>
sheath layer of the cable of the invention may be produced by any process<br>
known in the art.<br>
It is preferred, however, that the base resin is a so-called in-situ blend of its<br>
constituents. By "in-situ blend", a multimodal polymer is meant which<br>
fractions are produced either simultaneously in one reaction stage (e.g. by<br>
using two or more different catalysts), and/or are produced in a multistage<br>
process. A multistage process is defined to be a polymerisation process in<br>
which a polymer comprising two or more fractions is produced by<br>
producing each or at least two polymer fraction(s) in a separate reaction<br>
stage, usually with different reaction conditions in each stage, in the<br>
presence of the reaction product of the previous stage which comprises a<br>
polymerisation catalyst. The polymer can be recirculated to any stage or<br>
reactor.<br>
Where herein preferred features of fractions (A) and/or (B) of the<br>
composition of the present invention are given, these values are generally<br>
valid for the cases in which they can be directly measured on the respective<br>
fraction, e.g. when the fraction is separately produced or produced in the<br>
first stage of a multistage process.<br><br>
-8-<br>
However, the base resin may also be and preferably is produced in a<br>
multistage process wherein e.g. fractions (A) and (B) are produced in<br>
subsequent stages. In such a case, the properties of the fractions produced<br>
in the second and third step (or further steps) of the multistage process can<br>
either be inferred from polymers, which are separately produced in a single<br>
stage by applying identical polymerisation conditions (e.g. identical<br>
temperature, partial pressures of the reactants/diluents, suspension medium,<br>
reaction time) with regard to the stage of the multistage process in which<br>
the fraction is produced, and by using a catalyst on which no previously<br>
produced polymer is present. Alternatively, the properties of the fractions<br>
produced in a higher stage of the multistage process may also be calculated,<br>
e.g. in accordance with B. Hagstrom, Conference on Polymer Processing<br>
(The Polymer Processing Society), Extended Abstracts and Final<br>
Programme, Gothenburg, August 19 to 21, 1997, 4:13.<br>
Thus, although not directly measurable on the multistage process products,<br>
the properties of the fractions produced in higher stages of such a<br>
multistage process can be determined by applying either or both of the<br>
above methods. The skilled person will be able to select the appropriate<br>
method.<br>
The base resin of the cable according to the invention preferably is<br>
produced so that at least one of fractions (A) and (B), preferably (B), is<br>
produced in a gas-phase reaction,<br>
Further preferred, one of the fractions (A) and (B) of the polyethylene<br>
composition, preferably fraction (A), is produced in a slurry reaction,<br>
preferably in a loop reactor, and one of the fractions (A) and (B),<br>
preferably fraction (B), is produced in a gas-phase reaction.<br><br>
-9-<br>
It is furthermore preferred that fraction (A) and (B) of the polyethylene<br>
composition are produced in different stages of a multistage process.<br>
Preferably, the multistage process comprises at least one gas phase stage in<br>
which, preferably, fraction (B) is produced.<br>
Further preferred, fraction (B) is produced in a subsequent stage in the<br>
presence of fraction (A) which has been produced in a previous stage.<br>
It is previously known to produce multimodal, in particular bimodal, olefin<br>
polymers, such as multimodal polyethylene, in a multistage process<br>
comprising two or more reactors connected in series. As an example of this<br>
prior art, mention may be made of EP 517 868, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by way of reference in its entirety, including all its preferred<br>
embodiments as described therein, as a preferred multistage process for the<br>
production of the polyethylene composition of the cable according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Preferably, the main polymerisation stages of the multistage process are<br>
such as described in EP 517 868, i.e. the production of fractions (A) and<br>
(B)	is carried out as a combination of slurry polymerisation for fraction<br>
(A)/gas-phase polymerisation for fraction (B). The slurry polymerisation is<br>
preferably performed in a so-called loop reactor. Further preferred, the<br>
slurry polymerisation stage precedes the gas phase stage.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, fraction (C) is also produced in the multistage<br>
process in which fractions (A) and (B) are produced. Preferably, fraction<br>
(C)	is produced in a so-called prepolymerisation step, preceding the<br>
production of further fractions of the base resin. As mentioned, the<br>
prepolymer is preferably an ethylene homopolymer (HDPE).<br><br>
-10-<br>
Preferably, in the prepolymerisation step, all of the catalyst is charged into<br>
a loop reactor and the prepolymerisation is performed as a slurry<br>
polymerisation. Such a prepolymerisation leads to less fine particles being<br>
produced in the following reactors and to a more homogeneous product<br>
being obtained in the end.<br>
In the production of the base resin, Ziegler-Natta (ZN) or metallocene<br>
catalysts are preferably used, more preferably Ziegler-Natta catalysts.<br>
The catalyst may be supported, e.g. with conventional supports including<br>
silica, Al-containing supports and magnesium dichloride based supports.<br>
Preferably the catalyst is a ZN catalyst, more preferably the catalyst is non-<br>
silica supported ZN catalyst, and most preferably MgCl2-based ZN catalyst.<br>
The Ziegler-Natta catalyst further preferably comprises a group 4 (group<br>
numbering according to new IUPAC system) metal compound, preferably<br>
titanium, magnesium dichloride and aluminium.<br>
The catalyst may be commercially available or be produced in accordance<br>
or analogously to the literature. For the preparation of the preferable<br>
catalyst usable in the invention reference is made to WO2004055068 and<br>
WO2004055069 of Borealis and EP 0 810 235. The content of these<br>
documents in its entirety is incorporated herein by reference, in particular<br>
concerning the general and all preferred embodiments of the catalysts<br>
described therein as well as the methods for the production of the catalysts.<br>
Preferably, the polymerisation conditions in the preferred multistage<br>
method are so chosen that, owing to a high content of chain-transfer agent<br>
(hydrogen gas), the comparatively low-molecular polymer is produced in a<br>
stage preceding the stage in which the high-molecular polymer is produced.<br>
The order of these stages may, however, be reversed.<br><br>
-11-<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the polymerisation of fraction (A) in a loop<br>
reactor followed by production of fraction (B) in a gas-phase reactor, the<br>
polymerisation temperature in the loop reactor preferably is 85 to 115 °C,<br>
more preferably is 90 to 105°C, and most preferably is 92 to 100°C, and the<br>
temperature in the gas-phase reactor preferably is 70 to 105 °C, more<br>
preferably is 75 to 100°C, and most preferably is 82 to 97°C.<br>
A chain-transfer agent, preferably hydrogen, is added as required to the<br>
reactors, and preferably 200 to 800 moles of H2/kmoles of ethylene are<br>
added to the reactor, when the LMW fraction is produced in this reactor,<br>
and 0 to 50 moles of Hi/kmoles of ethylene are added to the gas phase<br>
reactor when this reactor is producing the HMW fraction.<br>
If a prepolymerisation step is used in which fraction (C) is produced it is<br>
preferred that no hydrogen at all is introduced into the reactor during this<br>
step. We need to open up for allowing small addition of hydrogen.<br>
The composition for the outer sheath layer of the cable of the invention<br>
preferably is produced in a process comprising a compounding step,<br>
wherein the composition of the base resin, i.e. the blend, which is typically<br>
obtained as a base resin powder from the reactor, is extruded in an extruder<br>
and then pelletised to polymer pellets in a manner known in the art.<br>
Optionally, additives or other polymer components can be added to the<br>
composition during the compounding step in the amount as described<br>
above. Preferably, the composition of the invention obtained from the<br>
reactor is compounded in the extruder together with additives in a manner<br>
known in the art.<br><br>
-12-<br>
The extruder may be e.g. any conventionally used extruder. As an example<br>
of an extruder for the present compounding step may be those as supplied<br>
by Japan steel works, Kobe steel or Farrel-Pomini, e.g. JSW 460P.<br>
The cables of the invention in addition to the outermost sheath layer<br>
comprise at least one or more power or information conducting elements.<br>
The cable comprising the outer sheath layer may be produced...<br>
As indicated in the foregoing, the cable sheathing composition can be used<br>
for producing outer sheath layers for cables, including power cables as well<br>
as communication cables. Amongst power cables, mention may be made of<br>
high-voltage cables, medium voltage cables, and low voltage cables.<br>
Amongst communication cables, mention may be made of pair cables,<br>
coaxial cables and optical cables.<br>
Examples<br>
Measuring methods<br>
a) Molecular weight/molecular weight distribution<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular<br>
weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a<br>
method based on ISO 16014-4:2003. A waters 150CV plus instrument was<br>
used with column 3 x HT&amp;E styragel from Waters (divinylbenzene) and<br>
trichlorobenzene (TCB) as solvent at 140 °C. The column set was<br>
calibrated using universal calibration with narrow MWD PS standards (the<br>
Mark Howings constant K: 9.54* 10"5 and a: 0.725 for PS, and K: 3.92* 10"4<br><br>
-13-<br>
and a: 0.725 for PE). The ratio of Mw and Mn is a measure of the broadness<br>
of the distribution, since each is influenced by the opposite end of the<br>
"population".<br>
b)	Density<br>
Density is measured according to ISO 1872, Annex A.<br>
c)	Melt Flow Rate/Flow Rate Ratio<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the<br>
lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 190°C and<br>
may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2), 5 kg<br>
(MFR5)or21.6kg(MFR2i).<br>
The quantity FRR (flow rate ratio) is an indication of molecular weight<br>
distribution and denotes the ratio of flow rates at different loadings. Thus,<br>
FRR21/2 denotes the value of MFR21/MFR2.<br>
d)	Rheological parameters<br>
Rheological parameters such as Shear Thinning Index SHI and Viscosity<br>
are determined by using a rheometer, preferably a Rheometrics Phisica<br>
MCR 300 Rheometer. The definition and measurement conditions are<br>
described in detail on page 8 line 29 to page 11, line 25 of WO 00/22040.<br>
e) Environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR)<br><br>
-14-<br>
ESCR was evaluated according to CTL: ISO 6259, with a notch applied<br>
according to ASTM F1473, using CTL with different constant stress of 2, 3 and 4<br>
MPa. A 10% Igepal solution was used as medium.<br>
f) Cable samples for the evaluation are extruded as follows.<br><br>
Conductor	3.0 mm Solid Al conductor<br>
Wall thickess	1.0 mm<br>
Temperature, die	+210°C<br>
Distance between die and waterbath	35cm<br>
Temperature, water bath	+23°C<br>
Line velocity	75m/min<br>
Die type	Semi-tube<br>
Nipple	3.65mm<br>
Die	5,9mm<br>
Screw design	Elise<br>
g) Shrinkage<br>
The shrinkage in percent is measured after 24h in constant temperature (+23°C)<br>
as well as after 24h at a temperature of+100°C . Cable samples measuring<br>
approximately 40cm are measured. Conveniently, the samples is so marked that<br>
the measurement after the conditioning can be carried out at the same point on<br>
the cable sample.<br>
Should the sample be found to shrink during measurement, marks of about 40cm<br><br>
-15-<br>
first have to be made. Then the length is cut and remeasured. Double samples are<br>
taken of each cable that is to be analysed. The samples are placed in the room<br>
with constant temperature for 24h, whereupon they are measured, and shrinkage<br>
value in percent are calculated. All the samples are then placed on a talcum bed<br>
at 100°C for 24h. The samples are measured, and the total shrinkage in percent is<br>
calculated on the basis of the initial length.<br>
h) Filler absorption<br>
Filler absorption was measured according to BTM22511 on plaques, quenched in<br>
cool water.<br>
i) Mechanical properties<br>
Elongation at break and tensile strength at break were measured according to<br>
22542/ISO 527-2/1 A,B, either on plaques or on cables having a jacket of 1 mm<br>
in thickness applied on a 3 mm in diameter aluminium conductor.<br>
j) Heat deformation<br>
This was tested according to EN 60811-3-1:1995. This was tested on cables 3mm<br>
core and 1mm jacketing layer extruded directly on the conductor. This property<br>
is directly proportional to the density. In this test we have used cool waterbath<br>
during extrusion, therefore reproducing the worst case. When the molten plastics<br>
meet cold water the density is lower than if the crystallization takes place during<br>
slow cooling, see table for results. The indention at 115°C after 4h is recorded<br>
and reported as how many % the egg is pentrating the sample thisckness.<br><br>

As additives, 2400 ppm Irganox B225 and 1500 ppm calcium stearate have been<br>
used. The catalyst used in CompEx 9, 10 and CompEx 1-2 is a Ziegler-Natta type<br>
catalyst which corresponds to the one used in EP 6887794, Example 3.<br>

In CompEx 9, 10, the melt flow rate MFR2i.6kg/i90°c is significantly higher than in<br>
the comparative examples. Furthermore, as indicated by FRR21/2 and MWD<br>
values, the inventive examples have a broad molecular weight distribution.<br>
CompEx 3 is a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) including 15 wt% low<br>
density polyethylene to improve processability. Properties of the blend are given<br>
in Table 3:<br>

In the following, relevant processing properties and mechanical properties of<br>
these compositions will be provided and discussed.<br>
Processability<br>
As already discussed above, the processability of a jacketing material includes<br>
several parameters e.g. surface finish, output, melt pressure, and extruder motor<br>
power. It is important that the processing window is wide since there are many<br>
different applications for a jacketing material.<br>
To evaluate the processability, the compositions were extruded at a cable line,<br>
lmm thick jacket were applied on a 3mm in diameter aluminum conductor. To<br>
stress the material in terms of shrinkage performance the temperature setting was<br>
not optimal. The conductor was not preheated, the melt temperature was 210°C<br>
and the cooling bath temperature was 23°C. The line speed was 75m/min.<br>
Surface finish<br>
Surface finish was evaluated by visual and hands on inspection.<br>
Previous experience is that the lower the MFR the better is the surface finish.<br>
However, all cables produced showed a very smooth surface which is quite<br>
surprising considering the high MFR21 values chosen for CompEx 9,10.<br>
Output and melt pressure<br>
In Table 4, data from the cable line extrusion test are shown.<br><br>
-19-<br>

Filter pressure (Bar)	243	235	332	300	255<br>
RPM	61	61	65	59	58<br>
Extruder power (amps)	55	55	67	65	62<br>
The results of Table 4 clearly indicate that the compositions can be extruded at<br>
lower pressure and extruder power.<br>
The effect of MFR2i.6k^i9o°c on extruder pressure is also shown in Fig. 1. Due to<br>
the lower MFR21, CompEx 1-2 need a much higher extruder pressure to have the<br>
same output. By blending LDPE and LLDPE (i.e. CompEx 3), it is possible to<br>
have an extruder pressure comparable the one of CompEx 9, 10. However,<br>
adding LDPE adversely affects mechanical properties, heat deformation and<br>
shrinkage behaviour, as will be shown below.<br>
Environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR)<br>
The environmental stress cracking was evaluated using CTL with different<br>
constant stress. A 10% igepal solution was used as medium. The results are<br>
shown in table 5.<br><br>

Mechanical properties<br>
Elongation at break and tensile strength are summarized in Table 6. The results<br>
demonstrate that the inventive examples have good mechanical properties. In<br>
other words, processability has been improved while keeping mechanical<br>
properties on a high level.<br>

The data of Table 7 indicate that the compositions show low shrinkage. In<br>
particular, it is evident that the improvement in processability of CompEx 3 (e.g.<br>
low extrusion pressure) adversely affects shrinkage behaviour.<br>
Compatibility with filling compounds<br>
The main application for LD and LLD jackets is in telecommunication cables. In<br>
many telecables, copper or fiber optical, filling compounds are used to protect<br>
them from water intrusion. A petroleum jelly based, Insojell 3332 , is commonly<br>
used in copper cables. This filling compound is normally the filling compound<br>
that gives the highest absorption.<br>
Two tests are performed, weight increase and the influence on the mechanical<br>
properties.<br>
Dumbbells 2 mm thick from pressed plaques were put in Insojell 3332 for 7 days.<br>
The samples were put on aluminum rods to enable free access for the petroleum<br>
jelly from all sides. The ageing was done at 60°C. For the results see table 9.<br><br>

Examples 6-13<br>
In these examples, three polyethylene compositions according to the present<br>
invention (Ex 3-5) and five reference materials (CompEx 4-8) have been<br>
prepared.<br>
The inventive examples were prepared in a sequential multistage process<br>
including a prepolymerization step, followed by polymerization in a loop reactor<br>
and subsequently in a gas phase reactor. Thus, the final composition included<br>
three polymer fractions.<br>
As a catalyst for the examples 3-5, a commercial Lynx 200™ catalyst as<br>
manufactured and supplied by Engelhard Corporation has been used<br><br>
-23-<br>
Just like the inventive examples, CompEx 4-5 have been prepared in a sequential<br>
multistage process. However, in contrast to Ex 3-5, no prepolymerization step<br>
was included. Thus, CompEx 4-5 are bimodal.<br>
CompEx 4 is based on CompEx 1. However, low density polyethylene was<br>
added.<br>
CompEx 5 corresponds to CompEx 1.<br>
CompEx 6-7 are both based on linear low density polyethylene to which low<br>
density polyethylene has been added to improve processability.<br>
CompEx 8 has been prepared in a two-step process, the first step being carried<br>
out in a loop reactor, followed by a gas phase polymerization step.<br>

In Table 12, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of Ex 3-5 and<br>
CompEx 5 and 8 are summarized. From Table 12, it is evident that the presence<br>
of a third fraction in the inventive compositions significantly broadens the<br>
molecular weight distribution, if compared to the reference materials.<br><br>

In Table 13, the shear thinning index SHI(2.7/210) of Ex 3-5 and CompEx 8 is<br>
given.<br>

CompEx 4	41<br>
CompEx 5	35<br>
CompEx 6	50<br>
CompEx 8	25<br>
As shown in Table 13, the inventive compositions have high shear thinning<br>
index, significantly exceeding the value of the reference material. As already<br>
discussed above, high SHI values indicate a broad molecular weieht distribution.<br><br>
-28-<br>
The compositions have been subjected to tests for processability and mechanical<br>
properties. The results are shown and discussed below.<br>
Surface finish<br>
Surface finish was evaluated by visual and hands on inspection. Two different<br>
phenomena were observed, first the surface finish as such but also the shape of<br>
the insulation. At higher line speed a wave shape occurred at some of the<br>
materials. The former are due to the melt strength and the second is more due to<br>
extruder pumping and could possibly be corrected by increased melt temperature.<br>
However it indicates a more narrow processing window. Previous experience is<br>
that the lower the MFR the better is the surface finish. Although the inventive<br>
compositions have much higher MFR, they provide excellent results at these line<br>
speeds.<br>

Melt pressure<br>
Just like CompEx 9, 10, the inventive examples 3-5 have low melt pressure at a<br>
specific line speed. With CompEx 6-7 (i.e. blends of LLDPE and LDPE), a low<br>
melt tension can be obtained as well. However, as will be shown below, in these<br>
materials low-melt tension adversely affects tensile strength, heat deformation<br>
and shrinkage behaviour.<br>
In CompEx 4, 5 and 8, melt tension is significantly higher.<br>
Melt tension as a function of line speed is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Mechanical properties<br>
Mechanical properties are summarized in Tables 15 and 16.<br>

-30-<br>
that only the inventive examples have an improved balance between<br>
processability (e.g. low melt pressure) and mechanical properties.<br>

The materials prepared in a sequential multistage process (i.e. Ex 3-5 and<br>
CompEx 4, 5 and 8) have a more pronounced change in mechanical properties<br>
than the blend of LLDPE/LDPE. With regard to absorption weight increase, the<br>
inventive examples have the lowest values. Thus, considering both effects (i.e.<br>
change in mechanical properties as well as change in weight), the inventive<br>
materials offer the best compromise.<br>
Heat deformation values are provided in Table 19.<br><br>

The increase in crystallization temperature is beneficial for processing, e.g. for<br>
film applications, since the high molecular weight fraction (iii) acts as a nucleator<br>
increasing the crystallization. This is advantageous for the cooling properties<br>
after processing the article.<br><br>
