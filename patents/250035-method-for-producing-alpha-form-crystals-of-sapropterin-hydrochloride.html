				<td>DESCRIPTION METHOD FOR PRODUCING ALPHA FORM CRYSTALS OF SAPROPTERIN HYDROCHLORIDE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
This invention relates to a method for selectively producing a form crystals of sapropterin hydrochloride which has excellent storage stability and thermal stability.<br>
BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY [0002]<br>
Sapropterin hydrochloride (L-tetrahydrobiopterin<br>
dihydrochloride) is a drug used in treating hyperphenylalaninemia. Hyperphenylalaninemia is a disease caused by a defect in a gene which exhibits symptoms including central nervous symptoms such as mental retardation, melanin deficient symptoms, and abnormal urine odor, all of which are caused by abnormal phenylalanine metabolism. [0003]<br>
Sapropterin hydrochloride is produced by using<br>
1' , 1' -diethylsulfonyl-L-rhamnose for the starting material to produce L-biopterin, and reducing this L-biopterin (see non-patent documents 1 and 2 and patent documents 1 to 5) . In these documents, sapropterin hydrochloride is isolated as crystals, and these documents are utterly silent about stability of the crystals.<br>
[Non-patent document 1] Helv. Chim. Acta, 68(6), 1639-1643(1985) [Non-patent document 2] Helv. Chim. Acta, 61, 2731(1978) [Patent document 1] Japanese Patent Publication No. 2-12475<br><br>
[Patent document 2] Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-13357 [Patent document 3] Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-86393 [Patent document 4] Japanese Patent No. 2711828 [Patent document 5] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 9-157270 [0004]<br>
The crystals of sapropterin hydrochloride produced by the methods as described above were problematic in terms of thermal stability and hygroscopicity, and there has been a demand for development of a method which enables stable supply of highly stable crystals.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the situation as described above, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing crystals of sapropterin hydrochloride which has excellent heat and moisture stability in a stable manner. [0005]<br>
The inventors of the present invention produced crystals of the sapropterin hydrochloride under various conditions and evaluated the crystals for their stability, and in the course of such evaluation, found that sapropterin hydrochloride has crystallographic polymorphism. More specifically, the inventors found that sapropterin hydrochloride has two types of crystals, namely, α form and β form, and the crystals having the inferior thermal and moisture stability that had been known were (3 form. Further investigation revealed that a form crystals having the superior thermal and moisture stability can be produced at a high efficiency in a stable manner by adjusting precipitation temperature,<br><br>
cooling rate and concentration of hydrochloric acid in the<br>
recrystallization or crystallization.<br>
[0006]<br>
Accordingly, the present invent ion provides a met hod for producing a form crystal of sapropterin hydrochloride comprising the steps of dissolving sapropterin hydrochloride with hydrochloric acid at a concentration of not less than 4 mol/L at not less than 70°C; adding heated ethanol to the solution; and cooling the solution at a cooling<br>
rate of not faster than 3°C/min to a temperature of 40 to 55°C toprecipitate<br>
the crystals.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention is capable of producing a form crystals of the sapropterin hydrochloride having excellent thermal and moisture stability at a high efficiency in a stable (i.e., reproducible) manner. Accordingly, a sapropterin hydrochloride which is useful as a medical starting material can be supplied in stable manner.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION [0009]<br>
The sapropterin hydrochloride used in the method of the present invention may be β form crystal, a mixture of α form and β form, or a powder thereof, and the target of the present invention is α form crystal. The α form crystal has infrared absorption spectrum as shown in FIG. 1 and X ray diffraction spectrum as shown in FIG. 2. In other<br>
words, this a form crystal has peaks in the infrared absorption spectrum at 1578 cm"1, 1089 cm"1, and 1072 cm"1, 792 cm"1, and peaks in the X ray diffraction spectrum at 2Ө = 10.0°, 20.0°, and 27.5°. [0010]<br>
On the other hand, the β form crystal has infrared absorption spectrum as shown in FIG. 3 and X ray diffraction spectrum as shown in FIG. 4. In other words, the β form crystal has absorption at 1640 cm"1, 1615 cm"1, 1329 cm"1, 1059 cm"1, and 746 cm"1, and peaks in the X ray diffraction spectrum at 20 = 6.2°, 9.4°, 25.4°, 26.7°, 28.4°, and 30.8°. [0011]<br>
With regard to moisture absorption, a form crystal undergoes increase in weight by moisture absorption of 0.85 to 2% during storage<br>
for 14 days under the conditions of 25°C and at relative humidity of 20 to 75%. Increase in weight, however, is stable from day 1 to day<br><br>
14 . On the other hand, weight of the P form crystal gradually increases under the conditions of 25°C and a relative humidity of 60%, and weight increase is 3.5% at 18 hours and the increase continues to the maximum<br>
of 3.9%. From this, α form crystal is more moisture-stable than β form. Furthermore, in contrast to the β form crystal which changes the color from white to pale yellow due to moisture absorption, a form crystal does not change its color by the moisture absorption. Accordingly, α form crystal is suitable for storage. [0012]<br>
Furthermore, in differential thermal analysis, α form crystal has only one endothermic peak near the 250°C as shown in FIG. 5 while β form crystal has two endothermic peaks near 180°C and near 230°C as shown in FIG. 6. Accordingly, α form crystal is superior in thermal stability compared to the β form crystal. <br>
[0013]<br>
In the present invention, sapropterin hydrochloride is dissolved by using hydrochloric acid at a concentration of not less than 4 mol/L<br>
at a temperature of not less than 70°C, and heated ethanol is added, then the mixture is cooled for precipitation of the crystals. Use of the hydrochloric acid having a concentration of not less than 4 mol/L for dissolution of the sapropterin hydrochloride is important for selective production of the α form crystal. When the hydrochloric acid used has a concentration of less than 4 mol/L, the β form crystals will be precipitated. The concentration of the hydrochloric acid is more preferably 4 to 12 mol/L, and most preferably 4 to 10 mol/L. Amount of the hydrochloric acid used is not particularly limited, and the hydrochloric acid is preferably used at 2.0 to 6.0-fold weight, and<br><br>
more preferably at 3.4-fold weight of the mass of the sapropterin hydrochloride. [0014]<br>
Amount of the ethanol used is not particularly limited. However, the ethanol is preferably used at an amount of 2 to 10-fold volume, and more preferably at 2 to 7-fold volume of the total amount of the sapropterin hydrochloride and the hydrochloric acid (in volume) in view of improving the yield of the a form crystals. [0015]<br>
The mixture of the sapropterin hydrochloride and the hydrochloric acid is dissolved by heating the mixture to a temperature of 70°C or more. The components may be mixed in any order, and the components may<br>
be preliminary heated to a temperature of 7 0°C or higher, or alternatively, the components may be mixed before heating the mixture to a temperature<br>
of 70°C or higher. These two components dissolve completely when they are heated to a temperature of 70°C or higher. The components or the mixture is preferably heated to a temperature of 7 0 to 8 5°C, more preferably to 70 to 80°C, and most preferably to 75 to 80°C. [0016]<br>
Heated ethanol is subsequently added to the resulting sapropterin hydrochloride solution while the temperature is maintained by heating, and the mixture is cooled at a cooling rate of 3°C/min or less to a temperature of 40 to 55°C to thereby precipitate the crystals.  In such a case, a form crystals of sapropterin hydrochloride selectively precipitates, p form crystals will precipitate when the cooling rate is 8 . 0°C/min or higher. The cooling rate is more preferably 0 .1 to 3°C/min, and more preferably 0.2 to 2.5°C/min.<br><br>
With regard to a precipitation temperature, a form crystals is obtainable selectively when the crystals are precipitated at 40 to 55°C while p form crystals precipitates when the precipitation is conducted at a temperature less than 40°C. Crystal precipitation at a temperature exceeding 55°C will not be efficient. [0017]<br>
When the crystals precipitated at 40 to 55°C are filtered at the same range of temperature, highly pure a form crystals can be isolated. The a form crystals may be cooled after the isolation. [0018]<br>
The resulting a form crystals of the sapropterin hydrochloride are highly stable under heat and humidity, and quite advantageous for a long term storage and in pharmaceutical preparation steps; therefore it is important in supplying high quality drug in a stable manner.<br>
