				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a device for positioning a die block of a casting table of a machine for the continuous vertical ascendant casting of parts and to the casting of molten metals, and in particular pipes of cast iron. Although it applies to the casting of various types of metal part, it is particularly advantageous for the casting of thin-walled cast iron pipes. The expression "thin-walled pipes" applies to pipes having a small thickness/diameter ratio, less than 10%, rather than the thickness considered by itself in isolation.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a device for positioning a die block in a machine for the continuous vertical ascendant casting of cast iron pipes with respect to a vertical extraction axis. Such a casting machine incorporates a die block and a device for the supply of liquid iron which feeds the die block through the lower end thereof. Such a supply device is for example described in document FR-A-2 705 259 (Indian patent 189,487) in the name of the Applicant. This device for the supply of liquid iron comprises a U-shaped siphon unit manufactured from cast refractory concrete, on whose outlet the die block rests.<br>
Given the high temperatures involved in the casting of molten metals, such a siphon unit becomes progressively worn and/or consumed by the molten iron which is in contact with it during the continuous casting process. In addition to this, when casting is stopped, solidification of the cast iron bursts the siphon unit.<br>
As a consequence, this siphon unit must be replaced as a whole as soon as a particular number of pipes have been cast, that is at every shut-down.<br>
Given that the siphon unit is a relatively massive component, and given its location on the casting table of a casting machine in a pipe production system, in-situ replacement of the siphon unit is very difficult, if not impossible. This is why the entire casting table has to be removed from the pipe production system in order that it can be dismantled and the siphon easily replaced.<br>
Furthermore, to shorten the length of the interruption in the manufacture of pipes several identical casting tables are used alternately. When a siphon unit on one of the casting tables has to be replaced, another is installed in the pipe manufacturing system.<br>
However, when a casting table is replaced, alignment between the die and the vertical axis along which the pipes are extracted gives rise to a problem. In fact the die block must be precisely aligned with the vertical extraction axis if the pipe manufacturing system is to operate correctly. Now, given that the casting table has been completely dismantled, this alignment between the die block and the extraction axis is difficult and takes up a great deal of time, in particular on account of the uncertain geometry of the refractory material parts used.<br>
The purpose of this invention is to overcome this problem of positioning the die block with respect to the vertical extraction axis by providing a die block positioning device through which rapid and precise alignment between the die block and the vertical extraction axis can be achieved in order to reduce the length of interruptions in pipe manufacture.<br>
With this object the invention relates to a device for positioning a die block of a casting table of a machine for the continuous vertical ascendant casting of parts, in particular pipes, of cast iron with respect to a vertical extraction axis, in which machine the die block is fed via its lower end by a device for the supply of liquid iron and bears thereupon, a positioning device characterised in that it comprises a retractable support in which the die block is fixed, a movable frame on which the device for supply of the liquid iron is placed, means for relative positioning of the support with respect to the frame, immobilising means intended to immobilise the relative position between the support and the frame in such a way that the support and the frame form an integral assembly, a base arranged in a predetermined way with respect to the vertical extraction axis, which is designed to support the integral assembly, and means for aligning the axis of the die block and the vertical extraction axis.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a device for positioning a die block of a casting table of a machine for the continuous vertical ascendant casting of parts, in particular pipes of cast iron, with respect to a vertical extraction axis, in which machine the die block is fed through its lower end by means of a device for the supply of liquid iron, and bears thereupon, a positioning device characterised in that it comprises a retractable support in which the die block is fixed, a removable frame on which the device supplying the liquid iron is placed, means for relative positioning of the support with respect to the frame, immobilising means designed to immobilise the relative position between the support and the frame in such a way that the support and the frame form an integral assembly, a base located in a predetermined fashion with respect to the vertical extraction axis and designed to support the integral assembly, and means for aligning the axis of the die block and the vertical extraction axis.<br>
The device according to the invention comprises one or more of the following features:<br>
the positioning means comprise at least two elongated members which are integral with the support and corresponding guide members which are attached to the frame and which are each designed to receive an elongated member, or vice versa, the said members forming in particular short column and ball-bearing socket assemblies,<br>
at least one immobilising member is a jack, in particular a fluid-operated jack, connected to both the support and the frame,<br>
at least one end of each jack is connected! to the support and/or the frame by means of a mounting and a removable gudgeon to fix the end of the jack in the mounting,<br>
the alignment means comprise means for relative positiocing of the frame with respect to the base and means for adjusting the integral assembly horizontally,<br>
the mean:; for relative positioning of the frame with respect to the base comprise at least a centering member, which is integral with the base, and projects therefrom in the direction of the frame, and a corresponding receiving member which is integral with the frame, or vice versa,<br>
the member for centering or integral acceptance of the frame is aligned with the axis of the die block and the member associated integrally with the base is aligned with the vertical extraction axis,<br>
the mean;; for horizontal adjustment comprise several supporting jacks distributed over the lower surface of die integral assembly,<br>
at least one supporting jack is a screw jack,<br>
The invention also relates to a casting table for a machine for the continuous vertical ascendant casting of parts, in particular pipes, of cast iron, a casting table in which the die block is fed via its lower end by a device for the supply of liquid iron and bears thereupon, characterised in that it comprises a positioning device as defined above.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description which is given by way of a non-restrictive example with reference to the appended drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of a casting table according to the invention, with a first cut-away at the inlet to the device for the supply of liquid iron and a second cut-away at the outlet from this device,<br>
Figure 2 is a view of the casting table from above, in the direction of arrow 13 in Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 is a view in transverse szross-section along the line Ill-Ill in Figure 2, Figure 4 is a plan view of the top in the direction of arrow IV in Figure 1, iind Figure 5 is a view on an enlarged scale of detail V in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a casting table 1 of a machine for the continuous vertical ascendant casting of parts, in particular pipes T, made of cast iron. This table comprises a device 3 for the supply of liquid iron and a casting block 5 fed through its lower end by this supply device 3. Pipe T is extracted from die block 5 by extraction means which are not shown, in an upward direction, along the vertical extraction axis X-X. The direction of the extraction force is represented by an arrow F.<br>
Device 3 for the supply of liquid iron is placed on a frame 6 and is jirevented from making lateral and vertiail movements thereon by vertical tie bars 7 and horizontal cross-members 8. It incorporates a U-shaped siphon 9 which is constructed in a single jriece from cast refractory concrete.<br>
This siphon 9 incorporates a moll en iron feed conduit 10 comprising a vertical descending part 10A for entry of the molten iron, a horizontal part (which cannot be seen in die figures) and a vertical part 10B through which the upwardly directed liquid iron leaves.<br>
With reference to Figure 3, it will be seen that a heating base 11 is placed between die block 5 and siphon outlet 9. A seal for the molten metal is provided by two anuinular sealing gasket; 12A and 12B, the first 12A located between the outlet of siphon 9 arid heating base 11, and a second 12B located between heating base 11 and die block 5.<br>
In addition to this, siphon 9 and heating base ill are surrounded by a shell 13 in the thickness of which induction coils 14 are embedded. These induction coils 14 are provided with electrical current by an external generator, which is not shown, in order to keep the iron molten as a result of induction beating.<br>
Die block 5 is fixed in a retractable support 1.5 in the form of a platen. This die block 5 comprises a cooling unit 17 linked to a cooling fluid circuit by inlet pipe 17A and outlet pipe 17B. On its upper surface unit 17 has an extension of reduced diametisr. This enters a matching receptacle ISA in support 15 having vertical axis Y-Y and is fixed by means of a crown of axial bolts 15B (Figure 2).<br>
The relative position of support 15 with respect to frame 6 is determined by two downwardly directed short columns 18, fixed to support 15 in a diametrically opposite fashion with respect to die block 5, as shown in Figure 2. Figure .3 shows that each short column 18 is guided in an associated socket 19, provided with ball-bearings, which is fixed to frame 6.<br>
Because short columns 18 acting in conjunction with ball-bearing sockets 19 are used, the relative position of support 15 with respect to frame 6 and as a result the relative position of die block 5 with respect to frame 6 are precisely defined in a plane perpendicular to verticil extraction axis X-X, while the support/frame distance can be adjusted parallel to axis X-X.<br>
In order to immobilise the position of support 15 in relation to axiis X-X with respect to frame 6, two fluid-operated jacks 21, such as e.g. hydraulic jacks or pneumatic jacks, are fixed in diametrically opposite positions on support 15 (Figure 2). As illustrated in Figure 3, each jack 21 comprises a rod 22 whose free: end 23 is fixed by a gidgeon 24 in a mounting 25 which is integral with frame 6. Each gudgeon 24 is secured in mounting 25 by pins (not shown) so that support 15 can be easily dismantled from frame 6. Bodies 21A of jacks 21 are fixed to the upper surface of platen 15 by a collar 21B.<br>
As may be seen in Figure 1, each fluid-operated jack 21 is connected by a conduit 26, 27 to a common conduit 29. This common conduit 29 is connected to a hydraulic unit 31 which regulates the force with which eacil jack is tighteaed, and is shown diagraaimatically. Advantageously this hydraulic: unit is also mounted on frame 6.<br>
Once the position of support 15 with respect to frame 6 has been immobilised by jacks 21, the support and the jacks, in addition to die block 5 and supply device 3, form a rigid integral assembly.<br>
Frame 6 rests on a fixed base 40 at four points of support. For this purpose frame 6 has two horizontal supporting cross-members 42 of square cross-section on. its underside. As may be seen in Figure 2, these cross-members 42 are longer than the width of frame 6 and extend beyoad the frame at the sides. As shown in Figure 5, cross-members: 42 each have a threaded hole 45 in each of their terminal zones, in a wall 44 which is opposite base 40. A supporting bolt 46 is screwed into hole 45 and forms therewith a jack 47 providing horizontal adjustment for the frame. Bolt 46 is prevented from rotating prematurely by a lock nut 48. It will be understood therefore titiat the frame rests on base 40 through the lower ends of the four bolts 46.<br>
In order that the Y-Y axis of die block 5 can be accurately positioned with respect to axis X-X for the extraction of pipe T, frame 6 also comprises a horizontal centering cross-member 56 of square cross-section on its underside. With reference to Figure 3, this centering cross-member 56 has a wall 58 opposite base 40 in which a centering hole 60 is provided. This centering hole 60 is centered with respect to the Y-Y axis of die block 5. A protective cover 62 is located above centering hole 60.<br>
This centering hxxle 60 acts together without appreciable play with a centering pin 64 which is integral with base 40. Base 40 is arranged in such a way that the vertical axis of centering pin 64 is aligned with the extraction axis X-X of the extraction meams.<br>
Cooperation between this centering pin 64 and centering hole 60 makes it possible to bring a point on the axis of revolution Y-Y of die block 5 to coincide with the point on the vertical extraction axis X-X of the extraction means.<br>
In order that the angular position of frame 6 can also be fixed with respect to base 40, frame 6 includes at its right hand extremity as seen in Figure 1 an additional horizontal centering cross-member 70 of square cross-section. This cross-member 70 includes in its<br>
wall 72 opposite base 40, in the centre thereof, a centering groove 74 wrich acts with an additional centeiing pin 76 which is integral with base 40. This groove 74 is also protected against unintended obstruction by a protective cover.<br>
Frame 6 also includes horizontal cross-members 80, 82 and 84 of square cross-section on its underside which are designed to render frame 6 integral with base 40. Cross-members 80, 82 and 70 include holes in each of their lateral extremities designed to receive bolts which are fixed in base 40 in order to render the frame/base assembly rigid after frame 6 has been positioned with respect to base 40.<br>
The space between cross-members 56 and 82, and that between cross-members 82 and 84, is provided for the forks of a pallet transferor so that frame 6 can easily be removed together with casting table 1 so that siphon 9 of device 3 supplying molten iron can be replaced.<br>
As described earlier, siphon 9 of device 3 supplying liquid metal must be regularly replaced. For this purpose the lateral fixing bolts in cross-members 80, 82 and 70 are unscrewed and frame 6 is engagged by the forks of a pallet transferee to move the assembly to another place so that casting table assembly 1 can be dismantled. In order to do this fixing gudgeons 24 in mounting!; 25 are released, so that the assembly comprising support 15 with the die block, short columns 18 and jacks 21 can be lifted off. Then it is merely a matter of removing tie bars 7 and cross-members 8 in order to proceed with the replacement of worn siphon 9.<br>
In order to position die block 5 of a casting table 1 whose siphon 9 has just been replaced, short columns 18 are engaged in ball-bearing sockets 19. Then the iree ends of the rods of jacks 21 are secured in mountings 25 using gudgeons 24 and any movement in the latter is prevented by rawins of pins. Using a hydraulic unit 31, a certain tightening force is applied to jacks 21 so that die block 5 bears against supply means 3 crushing gaskets 12A, 12B, heating base 11 being placed between die block 5 and supply device 3. As a result of this<br>
first relative positioning the axis of revolution Y-Y of die block 5 housed in cooling block 17 is centered with respect to centering hole 60 provided in centering cross- member 56.<br>
Then frame 6 which bears flanged support 15 is placed on base 40 in fiuch a way that centering pm 64 engages centering hole 60, the angular position of frame 6 with respect to the base being fixed by additional centering pin 76 which engages centering groove 74. At this stage vertical extraction axis X-X and axis of revolution Y-Y of die block 5 intersect in the vicinity of centering pin 60. In order to make the two axes coincide it is then sufficient to adjust frame 6 horizontally on base 40 using bolts 46. The position of bolts 46 is then immobilised using lock nuts 48. Finally, to make the assembly rigid, bolts are screwed through the lateral holes provided in cross-members 80, 82 and 70 in base 40.<br>
The die can be zdigned with reswct to extraction axis X-X accurately and quickly by this means. As a result of this, downtime in the pips casting system is greatly reduced.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
