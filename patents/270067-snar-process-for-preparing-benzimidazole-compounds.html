BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	Related Application<br>
[0002]	The present invention claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application Serial<br>
No. 60/693,374 filed June 23, 2005, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.<br>
[0003]	Field of the Invention<br>
[0004]	This  invention relates to processes for the  preparation of heterocyclic<br>
compounds. More specifically, this invention relates to the synthesis of compounds that can be used to prepare pharmaceutical agents such as benzimidazole derivatives. This invention further includes intermediate compounds obtained during the synthesis of the heterocyclic compounds of this invention and to the methods of preparation thereof.<br>
[0005]	Description of the state of the art<br>
[0006]	Benzimidazole derivatives have been investigated as therapeutics for treating<br>
cancers, viral infections, and diseases and pathological conditions involving inflammation and have been disclosed in a number of patents and publications in the last several years, including U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2003/0232869, 2004/0116710, and 2003/0216460; U.S. Patent No. 5,525,625; WO 98/43960;" WO 99/01421; WO 99/01426; WO 00/41505; WO 00/42002; WO 00/42003; WO 00/41994; WO 00/42022; WO 00/42029; WO 00/68201; WO 01/68619; WO 02/06213; WO 03/077914; and WO 03/077855.<br>
[0007]	In particular, WO 03/077914 describes the synthesis of the sodium salt of a<br>
benzimidazole derivative 11 from 2,3,4-trifluorobenzoic acid in 11 linear steps as illustrated in Scheme 1. Introduction of a di-substiuted aniline is accomplished by the stepwise introduction of an unsubstituted aniline moiety, followed by subsequent bromination and chlorination. Not only is this process inefficient in terms of the number of linear synthetic steps required, but there are also selectivity issues, as well as process safety issues around the chlorination reaction. For example, the synthesis shown in Scheme 1 includes a number of chemical transformations that could be hazardous to carry out on<br>
a manufacturing scale, and/or produce levels of by-products that would not be acceptable in a final active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that for a process to be suitable for industrial application it should be (i) amenable to being performed on large scale, (ii) have minimal environmental impact (for example in terms of amount of raw materials required and/or the amount of waste produced), (iii) safe (for example, use materials of low toxicity that do not produce toxic waste), and (iv) as low in cost as possible (for example, by being a higher yielding and more convergent synthesis). Since heterocyclic compounds such as benzimidazoles are potentially useful as therapeutics, there is an on-going need for a more efficient synthetic route for the production of benzimidazole derivatives that is more suitable for large-scale manufacture. A single step procedure that would allow the introduction of substituted aniline would therefore be extremely useful for the purpose of manufacturing benzimidazole derivatives.<br>

benzimidazole core structures in any of the above-described Methods 1-4 can<br>
[0078] [0079] [0080][0081]b performed in several ways. Five cyclization methods, namely ethods A-E, are described in general below with respect to the cyclization of a compound of Formula VIII-1. However, it is to be understood that Methods A-E apply equally to the cyclizations of compounds of Formulas VIII-2. The cyclization methods will provide either N-3 benzimidazole derivatives or N-l benzimidazole derivatives, depending on the reagents used and the particular R3 substituents on the compounds of Formulas VIII-1. Method A: A compound of Formula VIII-1, wherein R3 is hydrogen, can be cyclized to the corresponding benzimidazole represented by Formula Ia-1, wherein R4 is hydrogen, by a "one pot" method upon treatment with (i) formic acid, optionally in the presence of a second acid or (ii) a formic acid derivative in the presence of an acid. The nitrile group of said compound of Formula Ia-1 can then be converted to a COOR1 group, wherein R1 is as defined herein, to provide of the benzimidazole tautomer represented by Formula Ia-2 wherein R4 is hydrogen. If desired, the compound of Formula Ia-2 can be reacted with an alkylating agent to provide a mixture of the N-l and N-3 alkylated benzimidazoles Ia-2 and Ib-2(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>

the presence of a second acid, (ii) a formic acid derivative in the presence of<br>

(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br>
[00131]<br><br>
wherein X3 and X4 are independently F, Cl, Br, I, or a sulfonate ester and X5 is<br><br>
as defined herein to provide a compound of Formula IV<br>
CN<br>
.X3<br><br>
[00132]<br>
[00133]<br>
[00134]<br><br>
wherein X3, X4 and X5 are as defined herein. In one embodiment, X3, X4 and X5 are F. The compound of Formula IV is then reacted with (i) a reagent that contains or generates ammonia, (ii) a primary or secondary amine other than an aromatic amine, or (iii) a reagent that delivers a group that can subsequently be converted into an amine, under conditions that allow selective displacement of X4 of said compound of Formula IV, to provide said compound of Formula Va wherein A is NR3R3a; or said compound of Formula IV is reacted with (iv) a metal azide under conditions that allow selective displacement of X4 of said compound of Formula IV to provide said compound of Formula Vb wherein A is N3.<br>
Nitration reaction conditions suitable for the preparation of compounds of Formula IV are well known to those skilled in the art, and include, but are not limited to reacting a compound of Formula IIa with nitric acid in the presence of an activating agent such as concentrated sulfuric acid. With continued reference to Figure 2, the X4 group of the compound of Formula IV is then selectively replaced by a nitrogen nucleophile to provide a compound of Formula Va or Vb. Examples of nucleophilic reagents that contain or generate ammonia include, but are not limited to, NH3 and NH4OH. Examples of nucleophilic primary and secondary amines include amines having the formula HNR3R3a, wherein R3 and R3a are as defined herein. Specific examples of primary and secondary amines include, but are not limited to methylamine, benzylamine, dibenzylamine, allylamine, diallylamine" and hexamethyldisilazane. Examples of nucleophilic reagents that deliver a group that can subsequently be converted into an amine include, but are not limited to, (1) metal amides such as sodium, potassium and lithium amide, or alkylated derivatives thereof, (2) protected ammonia or amide equivalents<br>
such as, but not limited to, hydroxylamines and hydrazines, (3) nitrogen nucleophiles having the Formula MNR3R3a wherein M is a metal such as Na, • K, Li, Cs, Mg or Al and R3 and R3a are as hereinbefore defined and such as NaNH2, KNH2 or LiNH2 and (4) metal silylamides such as lithium (bis)(trimethylsilyl)amide, sodium (bis)(trimethylsilyl)amide or potassium (bis)(trimethylsilyl)amide. Examples of nucleophilic metal azides include, but are not limited to, sodium azide (NaN3), potassium azide (KN3) and lithium azide (LiN3).<br>
[00135]	Nucleophilic substitution of a leaving group ortho- or para- to a nitro group in<br>
an aromatic ring is a method well known in the art for the introduction of an amino group into an aromatic ring. In the case of compounds of Formula IV, it was discovered that, under controlled reaction conditions, the leaving groups X3 and X4 can be replaced independently in separate steps. That is, the group in the position ortho- to the nitro group in compounds of Formula IV (i.e., the X4 group) is selectively replaced by a nitrogen nucleophile with minimal or no • displacement of the X3 group when the reaction is performed under the appropriate reaction conditions. The reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, equivalents of nucleophile, etc.) needed to achieve selective mono-amination at the position ortho- to the nitro group of compound of Formula IV depend on the strength of the nucleophile. For example, if a strong nucleophile is used, the reaction may proceed easily at or below room temperature and at atmospheric pressure using one equivalent of the nucleophile to provide the desired mono-amination product. Examples of strong nucleophiles include, but are not limited to, aqueous ammonia (30% vol/vol) and metal amides such as sodium, potassium and lithium amide. Alternatively, if a weak nucleophile is used, more forcing conditions such as elevated temperatures and/or elevated pressure and/or an excess amount of the nucleophile may be required to achieve monoamination. Examples of weak -nucleophiles include, but are not limited to, a primary or secondary amine substituted with a sterically bulky group such as t-butyl. The introduction of an amino group at the position ortho- to the nitro group provides the substitution product represented by Formula Va or Vb, which is less reactive to further nucleophilic attack, and therefore the reaction can be carried out<br>
with a high level of selectivity. The leaving group X3 at the position para- to. the nitro group is replaced in a subsequent step of Method 1 by an aniline nucleophile. The discovery of methodology that allows the two substitution reactions to be carried out selectively and independently allows for an efficient route for the manufacture of substituted benzimidazoles of a type represented by la-1 and la-2.<br>
[00136]	In a particular embodiment, a compound of Formula Va is prepared by<br>
reacting a compound of Formula IV with excess NR4OH at room temperature in water (with or without an organic co-solvent). Examples of suitable organic co-solvents include THF, 1,4-dioxane and N-methyl pyrrolidine. Alternatively, a compound of Formula Va can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula IV with aqueous ammonia at temperatures between 0 and 130 °C, in particular between 30 and 130 °C under 1-5 bar NH3(g). In one embodiment, a compound of Formula IV is reacted with aqueous ammonia at temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature, hi another embodiment, a compound of Formula IV is reacted with aqueous ammonia under 1 bar NH3(g).<br>

Furthermore, benzimidazole derivatives represented by Formulas Ia-1, Ib-1, Ia-2 and Ib-2 can be synthesized from trihalobenzoic acids in a relatively short number of steps.<br>

wherein R2, R3, R4a, X1, X2 and X5 are as defined herein. Removal of the R3 group from said compound of Formula XI-1 provides the N-3 benzimidazole compound of Formula Ia-1.<br>
Methods for removing N-l substituents from benzimidazoles are well known to persons skilled in the art, and the reagents and reaction conditions required depend on the nature of the R3 group. For example, when the R3 group of a compound of Formula XI-1 is N-alkyl, N-allyl, N-benzyl, -C(O)OR5 or -COR5, removal of the R3 group can be achieved by hydrogenation. An N-l allyl substituent can also be removed from a compound of Formula XI-1 by heating the compound of Formula XI-1 in the presence of an organometallic catalyst such as Rh(PPh3)3Cl, also known as Wilkinson's catalyst. Examples of formic acid esters for the cyclization Methods A, B, C and E include trimethylorthoformate, triethylorthoformate, and formamidine acetate. The above-described cyclization Methods A-E of the present invention offer several advantages over conventional methods for the preparation of benzimidazole derivatives. First, there are only a few literature examples of the conversion of a diamino aryl compound to a benzimidazole (see, for example, G. P. Ellis, R.T. Jones, /. Chem. Soc., Perkin 1, 1974, 903; G.T. Morgan, W.A.P. Challenor, J. Chem. Soc. Trans., 1921, 1537; N.S. Zefirov, et al., Zyk, ECHET98: Electronic Conference on Heterocyclic Chemistry, (1988)<br>

Int., (1993), 25:703-704), however, none of the reported examples involved highly substituted substrates such as those involved in the process of the present invention. In addition, in many of the literature examples the regioselectivity is uncertain (G.T. Morgan, W.A.P. Challenor, J. Chem. Soc. Trans., 1921,1537). Furthermore, the methods of this invention are more suitable for industrial applications, since it uses reagents that are less toxic than the HC1/HCHO reagent mixture used in conventional methods, and therefore do not generate toxic by-products such as dichloromethyl ether.<br>
