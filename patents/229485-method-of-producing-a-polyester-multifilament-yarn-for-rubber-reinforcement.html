				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the invention<br>
The present invention pertains to an industrial<br>
polyester multifilament yarn with high modulus and low<br>
shrinkage, which is useful as a fiber reinforcement material<br>
of a tire, and a method of producing the same. Compared to<br>
a prior industrial polyester multifilament yarn with high<br>
modulus and low shrinkage, the industrial polyester<br>
multifilament yarn according to the present invention is<br>
advantageous in that the polyester multifilament yarn,<br>
treated with an adhesive (RFL) and heat-treated in order to<br>
produce a tire cord, has excellent physical properties,<br>
including tenacity, elongation, toughness, shrinkage, and<br>
dimensional stability, even though a grey yarn of the above<br>
polyester multifilament yarn has poor tenacity, elongation,<br>
and toughness. Accordingly, the polyester multifilament<br>
yarn of the present invention is usefully applied to produce<br>
a treated cord with high modulus and tenacity, and low<br>
shrinkage.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br><br>
Generally, a prior method of producing an industrial<br>
polyethylene terephthalate polyester fiber with high modulus<br>
and low shrinkage, includes a high-speed spinning step of<br>
spinning a yarn at a spinning rate of 2000 m/min or higher,<br>
a drawing step at a glass transition temperature or higher,<br>
that is, 80°C or higher, typically 110°C or higher according<br>
to a spin draw process, and a heat-setting step at 220°C or<br>
higher.<br>
An earliest method of producing an industrial<br>
polyethylene terephthalate fiber with high modulus and low<br>
shrinkage is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,101,525 (Herbert<br>
al Davis, et al.), in which a heat-setting process is<br>
conducted at 220 to 240°C to produce the polyester fiber<br>
with crystallinity of 45 to 55 %.<br>
Heretofore, the crystallinity of 45 to 55 % has been<br>
considered as one of standard physical properties of the<br>
industrial polyethylene terephthalate drawn yarn with high<br>
modulus and low shrinkage.<br>
Meanwhile, U.S. Pat. No. 4,491,657 (Iso Saito, et al.)<br>
suggests a method of producing a polyethylene terephthalate<br>
drawn yarn, in which a heat-setting temperature is 220°C,<br>
and the polyester drawn yarn has terminal modulus of 0 to 15<br>
g/d, thereby improving strength retention of a tire cord,<br>
produced using the above polyester drawn yarn.<br>
Furthermore, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,349,501 (Maxwell C.<br><br>
Hamlin, et al.) and 4,851,172 (Hudge H. Lowan, et al.)<br>
recite a drawing process using steam at 300°C or higher, in<br>
which a draw point is fixed. As well, Japanese Pat. Laid-<br>
Open Publication No. Hei. 7-70819 (Masayasu Nagao, et al.)<br>
proposes a process of producing a polyester drawn yarn, in<br>
which a winding process is conducted at a spinning rate of<br>
2500 to 6000 m/min, and an undrawn yarn with an intrinsic<br>
viscosity of 0.85 or more and a density of 1.365 g/cm3 or<br>
more is subjected to a multi-stage drawing process at 100°C<br>
or lower and a heat-setting process at 225°C. However, this<br>
patent aims to produce the polyester yarn with low shrinkage<br>
similar to rayon or vinylon, and thus, it is hardly used to<br>
produce a yarn for a tire cord having high tenacity.<br>
Particularly, the undrawn yarn with the density of<br>
1.365 g/cm3 or more has too high crystallinity to<br>
mechanically draw. Hence, it is very difficult to produce a<br>
yarn with a high strength of 7.2 g/d or more required to<br>
produce the tire cord.<br>
While studying on improvement of strength retention of<br>
a polyester multifilament yarn, having high strength and<br>
modulus, and low shrinkage, treated with an adhesive for<br>
rubbers (an RFL adhesive for tire cords) and then heat-<br>
treated, in a process of producing a drawn yarn using a<br>
highly oriented undrawn yarn, the present inventors found<br>
the fact that strength retention (tenacity of a heat-treated<br><br>
tire cord/tenacity of a grey yarn) of the tire cord,<br>
produced using a prior yarn with high tenacity, elongation,<br>
and toughness, and low terminal modulus, is relatively low.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors reached a conclusion that<br>
in the case of a yarn for the tire cord subjected to a post-<br>
heat treating process, it is preferable to properly suppress<br>
crystallization of the yarn by heat so as to increase<br>
tenacity of a final product, produced using the above yarn,<br>
and to improve strength retention of the final product after<br>
the yarn is subjected to the post-heat treating process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made keeping<br>
in mind the above disadvantages occurring in the prior arts,<br>
and an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
polyester multifilament yarn for rubber reinforcement with<br>
high modulus and low shrinkage, and a method of producing<br>
the same, in which when the polyester multifilament yarn is<br>
produced according to a melt-spinning process, heat of a<br>
relatively low temperature is provided to the polyester yarn,<br>
for example, a drawing temperature and a heat-set<br>
temperature are set to be relatively low, to properly<br>
suppress crystallization of the polyester yarn by heat to<br>
produce the drawn yarn with a density of 1.38 to 1.3865<br><br>
g/cm3. At this time, a final product (product for rubber<br>
reinforcement, such as a tire cord), produced using the<br>
polyester multifilament yarn of the present invention, has<br>
relatively high strength retention, in comparison with the<br>
case of using a prior polyester multifilament yarn with high<br>
modulus and low shrinkage generally having the density more<br>
than 1.3865 g/cm3.<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the present<br>
invention provides a method of producing a polyester<br>
multifilament yarn for rubber reinforcement. The method<br>
includes A) melt-spinning polyester, containing 95 mole % or<br>
more ethylene terephthalate as a repeating unit, passing the<br>
spun polyester through a retarded cooling zone (heating or<br>
non-heating zone), right under a spinning nozzle, and a<br>
cooling zone, using blown air, to enable the spun polyester<br>
to be solidified to produce an undrawn yarn with an<br>
intrinsic viscosity (I.V.) of 0.83 or more and a density of<br>
1.338 g/cm3 or more while properly controlling a spinning<br>
rate and other spinning conditions, and oiling the undrawn<br>
yarn using a spin finish; and B) multi-stage drawing the<br>
undrawn yarn at relatively low drawing temperatures,<br>
preferably at 80°C (glass transition temperature (Tg) of<br>
typical polyester) or lower, such that a draw ratio is 1.5<br>
to 2.5, and heat-setting the resulting yarn using heat of an<br>
appropriate temperature, preferably at 210°C or lower, to<br><br>
produce a drawn yarn, having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.83<br>
or more, a carboxyl end group (CEG) of 20 microvalents/g or<br>
less, a density of 1.380 to 1.3865 g/cm3 (preferably, 1.380<br>
to 1.385 g/cm3), and a tenacity of 7.2 g/d or more.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects, features and other<br>
advantages of the present invention will be more clearly<br>
understood from the following detailed description taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 schematically illustrates the production of a<br>
polyester multifilament yarn for rubber reinforcement<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, a drawing<br>
temperature and a heat-setting temperature are set to be<br>
relatively low to produce a polyester multifilament yarn for<br>
rubber reinforcement, having a grey yarn density of 1.380 to<br>
1.38 65 g/cm3.<br>
In this regard, a typical spin finish (emulsion or<br>
neat oil) is used to produce the polyester multifilament<br>
yarn, and it is preferable to use a water-based emulsion<br><br>
spin finish to produce the polyester multifilament yarn, in<br>
consideration of pollution, the process control, the<br>
production costs, and stability.<br>
A drawing process may be conducted using general godet<br>
rollers. However, the drawing process may be conducted<br>
using other kinds of godet rollers according a specific<br>
process so as to improve drawing efficiency.<br>
For the present invention, when the drawing<br>
temperature is higher than 80°C, or the heat-setting<br>
temperature is higher than 210°C, crystallinity of a drawn<br>
yarn is increased and the drawn yarn has a density of 1.390<br>
g/cm3 or more, leading to undesirably significant reduction<br>
of strength retention of a treated cord, produced using the<br>
drawn yarn.<br>
In addition, when an intrinsic viscosity of the drawn<br>
yarn is less than 0.83, the treated cord has very lower<br>
tenacity than a grey yarn. Furthermore, when a density of<br>
an undrawn yarn is less than 1.338 g/cm3, the treated cord<br>
cannot have high modulus and low shrinkage.<br>
In case that a drawn yarn is produced using the<br>
undrawn yarn with physical properties, as describe above,<br>
(intrinsic viscosity less than 0.83 and density less than<br>
1.338 g/cm3), if the density of the drawn yarn is more than<br>
1.3865 g/cm3, the drawn yarn has better modulus and<br>
shrinkage than that of the present invention. However, when<br><br>
the drawn yarn is post-processed at relatively high<br>
temperatures to produce a final product, such as a tire cord,<br>
strength retention of the final product, produced using the<br>
drawn yarn with the density more than 1.3865 g/cm3, is<br>
significantly lower than in the case of using the grey yarn<br>
with the density of 1.3865 g/cm3 or lower.<br>
As well, when the density of the drawn yarn is less<br>
than 1.380 g/cm3, it is difficult to industrially produce a<br>
yarn with relatively high strength of 7.2 g/d or more, and<br>
it is necessary to excessively stretch the drawn yarn during<br>
a heat-treating process using an adhesive to obtain the<br>
desired strength required as a rubber reinforcement material.<br>
Accordingly, it is difficult to industrially produce the<br>
tire cord using the drawn yarn with the density less than<br>
1.380 g/cm3.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that a draw ratic be 1.5<br>
to 2.5 so as to prevent the undrawn yarn being excessively<br>
drawn. When the draw ratio is more than 2.5, the undrawn<br>
yarn is excessively drawn to significantly reduce strength<br>
retention of the final product, produced using the drawn<br>
yarn. On the other hand, when the draw ratio is less than<br>
1.5, tenacity of the grey yarn is reduced less than 7.2 g/d,<br>
and thus, it is hardly to produce an industrial yarn with<br>
relatively high strength.<br>
Meanwhile, the polyester multifilament yarn according<br><br>
to the present invention of density 1.38 to 1.3865g/cm3 has<br>
generally following physical properties: shrinkage of 4.5 %<br>
or more, intrinsic viscosity of 0.83 or more, carboxyl end<br>
group of 20 microvalents/g or less, and tenacity of 7.2 g/d<br>
or more.<br>
Furthermore, the treated cord produced using the<br>
polyester multifilament yarn of the present invention has<br>
following physical properties: E2.25 + FS of 6.0 to 8.0 %,<br>
tenacity of 6.2 to 8.0 g/d, and strength retention of 80 %<br>
or more.<br>
Compared to a prior polyester yarn with high modulus<br>
and low shrinkage, having a density more than 1.3865 g/cm3,<br>
produced according to a direct spinning drawing process, the<br>
polyester multifilament yarn according to the present<br>
invention has relatively low elongation and toughness, and<br>
relatively high shrinkage and terminal modulus, if tenacity<br>
is the same. Accordingly, the polyester multifilament yarn<br>
of the present invention is poorer than the conventional<br>
polyester yarn with high modulus and low shrinkage in terms<br>
of modulus and shrinkage. However, when the polyester<br>
multifilament yarn of the present invention is subjected to<br>
a post-heat treatment process to produce the treated cord,<br>
strength retention of the treated cord according to the<br>
present invention is improved by 2 % or more and the treated<br>
cord of the present invention has excellent modulus and<br><br>
shrinkage in comparison of a treated cord, produced using<br>
the prior polyester yarn.<br>
In case that densities of different undrawn yarn,<br>
produced through a melt spinning process using the same raw<br>
material, are 1.338 g/cm3 or more, from comparison of<br>
different drawn yarn, produced using the undrawn yarn with<br>
the same density in such a way that the different drawn<br>
yarns have the same tenacity or draw ratio, with each other,<br>
it can be seen that reduction of the density of the drawn<br>
yarn by 0.001 g/cm3 brings about improvement of strength<br>
retention of the dip cord, produced using the drawn yarn, by<br>
0.5 to 1 % (refer to Table 5).<br>
Strength retention of the treated cord according to<br>
the present invention depends on a twisting condition of the<br>
undrawn yarn, and is typically 80 % or more.<br>
The present invention breaks a commonly accepted idea<br>
that a grey yarn with relatively high tenacity, elongation,<br>
and toughness contributes to improving strength retention of<br>
a tire cord, produced by treating the grey yarn with an<br>
adhesive for rubbers (R.F.L) and heat-treating the grey yarn<br>
treated with the adhesive. In other words, the grey yarn of<br>
the present invention has relatively poor tenacity,<br>
elongation, and dimensional stability (modulus and<br>
shrinkage), but the tire cord, produced using the grey yarn<br>
of the present invention, has better tenacity, elongation,<br><br>
and dimensional stability than a tire cord, produced using<br>
the conventional polyester yarn (density more than 1.3865<br>
g/cm3) , produced under a prior drawing condition (drawing<br>
temperature, heat-setting temperature).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention proves the fact<br>
that an idea, in which relatively low terminal modulus of a<br>
yarn leads to increase of strength retention of a tire cord,<br>
produced using the yarn (refer to U.S. Pat. 4,491,657), is<br>
not always true.<br>
The drawn yarn according to the present invention may<br>
be converted into the dip cord according to a typical<br>
process.<br>
For instance, two plies of drawn yarns with 1000<br>
deniers are subjected to a plying and cabling process in the<br>
twist number of 440 turns/m, based on a typical polyester<br>
cord yarn, and after the cord yarn is dipped in an adhesive<br>
liquid for rubbers (RFL liquid), it is stretched by 2.0 to<br>
5.0 % and subjected to a heat-setting process at 230 to<br>
245°C for 1.5 to 2.5 min to produce a treated cord.<br>
The treated cord thusly produced (two plies of drawn<br>
yarns with 1000 deniers are subjected to a cabling and<br>
plying process in the twist number of 440 turns/m to produce<br>
the dip cord) has E2.25 + FS (which is an index indicating<br>
the degree of dimensional stability) of 6.0 to 8.0 % and<br>
tenacity of 6.2 to 8.0 g/d.<br><br>
Having generally described this invention, a further<br>
understanding can be obtained by reference to examples and<br>
comparative examples which are provided herein for the<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be<br>
limiting unless otherwise specified. In this regard,<br>
physical properties of multifilament yarns and treated cords<br>
according to the examples and comparative examples are<br>
evaluated as follows.<br>
1) Intrinsic viscosity (I.V.)<br>
0.1 g of sample was dissolved in an agent (90°C) of<br>
phenol and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, mixed with each other<br>
in a weight ratio of 6:4, for 90 min according to an ASTM D<br>
4 603 method such that a concentration of the sample was 0.4<br>
g/100 ml, and the resulting solution was then maintained in<br>
an Ubbelohde viscometer in a thermostatic bath at 30°C for<br>
10 min. Subsequently, flow time of the resulting solution<br>
was counted using the Ubbelohde viscometer and an aspirator.<br>
Flow time of a solvent was obtained according to the<br>
same procedure as in the case of the resulting solution, and<br>
R.V. and I.V. were calculated by the following Equations 1<br>
and 2.<br>
Equation 1<br>
R.V. = flow time of the sample / flow time of the<br><br>
solvent<br>
Equation 2<br>
I.V. = 1/4 x [(R.V.-D/C] + 3/4 x (In R.V./C)<br>
wherein, C is a concentration (g/100 ml) of the sample<br>
in the solution<br>
2)	Strength and elongation<br>
Strength and elongation of the sample with a length of<br>
250 mm were measured in a standard state (20°C and relative<br>
humidity of 65 %) using Instron 5565, manufactured by Instron<br>
Corp. in USA, according to an ASTM D 885 under conditions of<br>
a tensile speed of 300 mm/min and the twist number of 80<br>
turns/m.<br>
3)	Density and crystallinity<br>
The density of the sample was measured using a<br>
toluene/carbon tetrachloride density gradient column at 23°C.<br>
The density gradient column was applied to a density range<br>
of 1.33 to 1.41 g/cm3, and was produced according to an ASTM<br>
D 1505-03.<br>
Equation 3<br>
Crystallinity (%) = pc/p x (p - pa)/(pc - pa)<br><br>
wherein, p is the density of the sample (g/cm3) , and pc<br>
and pa are densities of a crystal and a non-crystal of the<br>
sample, respectively. At this time, pc and pa are 1.455 and<br>
1.335 g/cm3, respectively<br>
4) Shrinkage<br>
The sample was left at a temperature of 20 °C and a<br>
relative humidity of 65 % under a standard state for 2 4<br>
hours or more, and then an initial length (Lo) of the sample<br>
was measured, which had a weight corresponding to 0.1 g/d.<br>
Subsequently, the sample was treated under a tensionless<br>
state at 150°C for 30 min with the use of a dry oven,<br>
followed by being left for 4 hours or more after the sample<br>
was removed from the dry oven. The resulting sample was<br>
weighed to measure a final length (L) thereof, thereby the<br>
shrinkage was calculated by the following Equation 4.<br>
Equation 4<br>
AS (%) = (Lo-L)/Lo x 100<br>
5) Terminal modulus<br>
From a strength elongation curve obtained by the<br>
strength and elongation of the sample, a maximum strain at<br>
breaking strength, which indicates maximum strength at break,<br>
was obtained, and the terminal modulus of the sample was<br><br>
calculated by subtracting 2.4 % from the strain at breaking<br>
strength using the following Equation 5.<br>
Equation 5<br>
Terminal modulus (g/d) = an increment of the tenacity<br>
until the maximum strength at break / 2.4 x 100<br>
6)	Elongation at specific load<br>
The elongation of the grey yarn was measured at a load<br>
corresponding to 4.5 g/d (based on 1000 deniers) from the<br>
strength elongation S-S curve, and the elongation of the dip<br>
cord (two plies of drawn yarns with 1000 deniers are<br>
subjected to a plying and cabling process to produce the<br>
treated cord) was measured at the load of 2.25 g/d.<br>
7)	Dimensional stability (E2.25 + FS)<br>
The dimensional stability of the treated cord is one of<br>
physical properties, relating to a side wall indentation<br>
(SWI) of a tire and a handling, and defined as the modulus at<br>
the given shrinkage. E2.25 (elongation at 2.25 g/d) + FS (free<br>
shrinkage) is an index regarding the dimensional stability of<br>
treated cord subjected to different heat-treating processes.<br>
At this time, the lower E2.25 + FS value is, the better the<br>
dimensional stability is.<br>
8) Strength retention<br>
The strength retention of the sample was calculated by<br><br>
substituting a tenacity value of the sample into the<br>
following Equation 6.<br>
Equation 6<br>
Strength retention (%) = (tenacity of the treated<br>
cord/tenacity of the yarn) x 100<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
An antimony compound, acting as a polymerization<br>
catalyst, was added into monomers in such a way that an<br>
amount of antimony trioxide in a polymer was 320 ppm, and<br>
the monomers were melt-polymerized in the presence of the<br>
antimony compound to produce polyethylene terephthalate<br>
chips. At this time, the chips had an intrinsic viscosity<br>
of 1.05 and a moisture content of 20 ppm.<br>
The chips thusly produced were melt-spun through a<br>
spinning nozzle 2 of a spinning pack 1 at 298 °C in a<br>
spinning speed of 590 g/min using an extruder such that a<br>
monofilament fineness of the resulting drawn yarn was 4.0<br>
deniers.<br>
Subsequently, the spun yarn passed through a retarded<br>
cooling zone (L) , right under the spinning nozzle 2, and a<br>
cooling zone (C) with a length of 530 mm (using cooling air<br>
at 20°C, flowing at a speed of 0.5 m/sec) to be solidified.<br><br>
15 % water-based spinning finish 3 was oiled on the<br>
solidified yarn, and wound at a winding rate of 2500 m/min<br>
to produce a undrawn yarn 4. The undrawn yarn 4 was<br>
subjected to a multi-stage drawing process using godet<br>
rollers (GR1 to GR3) , and subjected to a heat-setting<br>
process using a heat-set roller (GR4) . The drawn yarn was<br>
relaxed by 2.5 %, and then wound to produce the resulting<br>
drawn yarn (grey yarn) 5. At this time, the resulting drawn<br>
yarn 5 had a carboxyl end group (CEG) of 16<br>
microequivalents/g and a linear density of 1000 deniers.<br>
Two plies of grey yarns were subjected to a cabling<br>
and plying process in the twist number of 440 turns/m to<br>
produce a cord yarn. The cord yarn thusly produced was<br>
dipped two times in an RFL liquid, stretched by 3.0 to 3.5 %,<br>
and subjected to the heat-setting process at 240°C for two<br>
minutes to produce a dip cord. In this regard, an amount of<br>
the RFL liquid attached to the dip cord was controlled to<br>
4 %.<br>
Physical properties of the undrawn yarn, drawn yarn,<br>
and dip cord were evaluated, and the results are described<br>
in the following Tables 1, 2, and 3.<br><br><br><br>
In this respect, the draw roller is used in a drawing<br>
process before a final drawing is conducted (pair roller),<br>
the heat-set roller functions to provide heat the grey yarn<br>
after the final drawing is completed, and the relax roller<br>
serves to relax the grey yarn so as to stabilize a structure<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 TO 4<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate chips were produced and<br>
spun according to the same procedure as in the case of the<br>
example 1. Subsequently, the spun yarn was oiled using the<br>
same spin finish as in the case of example 1 according to<br>
the same procedure as in the case of example 1 to produce an<br>
undrawn yarn. The undrawn yarn thusly produced was drawn in<br>
conditions described in the Table 4, subjected to a heat-<br>
setting process, relaxed by 2.5 %, and wound to produce the<br>
resulting drawn yarn (grey yarn). At this time, the<br><br>
resulting drawn yarn had a fineness of 1000 deniers and a<br>
monofilament fineness of 4.0 deniers as shown in the Table 4.<br>
Two plies of grey yarns were subjected to a cabling and<br>
plying process in the twist number of 440 turns/m to produce<br>
a cord yarn. The cord yarn was dipped twice in an RFL<br>
liquid, stretched by 3.0 %, and subjected to the heat-<br>
setting process at 240°C for two minutes to produce a<br>
treated cord. Physical properties of the grey yarn and<br>
treated cord were evaluated, and the results are described<br>
in the following Table 5.<br><br><br><br>
In case that densities of different undrawn yarns,<br>
produced through a melt-spinning process using the same raw<br>
material, are 1.338 g/cm3 or more, from comparison of<br>
different drawn yarns, produced using the undrawn yarns with<br>
the same density in such a way that the different drawn<br>
yarns have the same tenacity or draw ratio, with each other,<br>
it can be seen that reduction of the density of the drawn<br>
yarn by 0.001 g/cm3 brings about improvement of strength<br>
retention of the treated cord, produced using the drawn yarn,<br>
by 0.5 to 1 %.<br><br>
As apparent from the above description, in the present<br>
invention, an undrawn yarn with a density of 1.338 g/cm3 or<br>
more is subjected to a multi-stage drawing process at a<br>
lower temperature than a glass transition temperature (80°C)<br>
of polyester such that a draw ratio is 1.5 to 2.5, and then<br>
subjected to a heat-setting process to properly suppress<br>
crystallization of the yarn by heat to produce a drawn yarn<br>
with a density of 1.38 to 1.3865 g/cm3.<br>
For the present invention, when the drawn yarn is<br>
converted into a treated cord through a heat treating<br>
process, the crystallization of the yarn by heat is slowly<br>
conducted. Accordingly, the drawn yarn of the present<br>
invention is useful to produce a treated cord having high<br>
tenacity, excellent strength retention and dimensional<br>
stability, and can be used as a grey yarn for tire cords.<br>
The present invention has been described in an<br>
illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the<br>
terminology used is intended to be in the nature of<br>
description rather than of limitation. Many modifications<br>
and variations of the present invention are possible in<br>
light of the above teachings. Therefore, it is to be<br>
understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the<br>
invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically<br>
described.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method of producing a polyester multifilament yarn for rubber<br>
reinforcement, comprising:<br>
A)	melt-spinning polyester, containing 95 mole % to 100 mole %<br>
ethylene terephthalate as a repeating unit, passing the spun polyester through a<br>
heating or a non-heating zone and a cooling zone to enable the spun polyester<br>
to be solidified to produce an undrawn yarn having an intrinsic viscosity (I. V.) of<br>
0.83 to 1.2 and a density of 1.338 g/cm3to 1.375 g/cm3, and oiling the undrawn<br>
yarn with a spin finish; and<br>
B)	multi-stage drawing the oiled undrawn yarn using a draw roller at<br>
25°C to 80°C, and heat-setting a resulting yarn using a heat-set roller at 170°C<br>
to 210°C to produce a drawn yarn having a density from 1.38 to 1.3865 g/cnf<br>
and a tenacity of 7.2 g/d to 9.5 g/d.<br><br>
2.	A polyester multifilament yarn for rubber reinforcement, produced<br>
according to the method as claimed in claim 1, having a density of 1.38 to<br>
1.3865 g/cm3, a shrinkage of 4.5% to 9.0%, an intrinsic viscosity of 0.83 to 1.2, a<br>
tenacity of 7.2 g/d to 9.5 g/d, and a carboxyl end group of 5 to 20<br>
microequivalents/g or less.<br>
3.	A treated cord, produced using the polyester multifilament yarn according<br>
to the method as claimed in claim 1, having E2.25+ FS of 6.0 to 8.0%,<br>
tenacity of 6.2 to 8.0 g/d, and strength retention of 80% to 92%, wherein E2.25 is<br>
an elongation at 2.25 g/d, and FS is a free shrinkage.<br><br>
Disclosed is a method of producing a polyethylene terephthalate-based polyester<br>
fiber, including spinning polyethylene terephthalate based polyester to produce an<br>
undrawn yarn with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.83 or more and a density of 1.338 g/cm3<br>
or more, multi-stage drawing the undrawn yarn, heat-setting the drawn yarn, relaxing<br>
the heat-set yarn, and winding the relaxed yarn to produce the resulting drawn yarn<br>
with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.83 or more and a density of 1.38 to 1.3865 g/cm3<br>
Compared to a prior polyester yarn with high modulus and low shrinkage, produced<br>
according to conventional melt-spinning and drawing processes, an industrial<br>
polyester yarn with high modulus and low shrinkage according to the present<br>
invention contributes to significantly improving strength retention (tenacity of a dip<br>
cord/tenacity of a grey yarn) of the dip cord, produced by treating the polyester yarn<br>
of the present invention with an adhesive (RFL) and subsequently heat-treating the<br>
RFL-treated polyester yarn. Therefore, the polyester multifilament yearn according<br>
to the present invention is useful as a tire cord.</td>
