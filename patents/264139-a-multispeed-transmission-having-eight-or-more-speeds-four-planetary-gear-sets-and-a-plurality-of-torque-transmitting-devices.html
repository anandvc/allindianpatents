CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/917,115 filed on May 10, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
torque transmitting devices, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	In an aspect of the present invention a transmission is<br>
provided. The transmission includes an input member, an output member first,<br>
second, third and fourth planetary gear sets each having first, second and third<br>
members, first, second, third, and fourth interconnecting members and five<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms. The first interconnecting member continuously<br>
interconnects the third member of the first planetary gear set with a stationary<br>
member. The second interconnecting member continuously interconnects the<br>
first member of the second planetary gear set with the stationary member. The<br>
third interconnecting member continuously interconnects the third member of the<br>
second planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
The fourth interconnecting member continuously interconnects the third member<br>
of the third planetary gear set with a third member of the fourth planetary gear<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br><br>
[0023] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the embodiments of<br>
the eight speed automatic transmission of the present invention have an<br>
arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the elements of the<br>
four planetary gear sets. For example, a first component or element of a first<br>
planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a ground or the transmission<br>
housing. A first component or element of a second planetary gear set is also<br>
permanently coupled to a ground or the transmission housing. A second<br>
component or element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled<br>
to a second component or element of the third planetary gear set. Finally, a first<br>
component or element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
first component or element of a fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0024] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br><br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches are presented as interleaved<br>
fingers. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0025] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0026] The second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is<br>
coupled to the output member 22. The third node 14C of the first planetary gear<br>
set 14 is coupled to a ground or transmission housing 50. The first node 16A of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 is also coupled to the ground or transmission<br>
housing 50. The second node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16 is<br>
coupled to the input member 12. The third node 16C of the second planetary<br>
gear set 16 is coupled to the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18.<br>
The third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 is coupled to the third node<br>
20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0027] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the second node 16B of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 and the input member 12 to the second node<br><br>
20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A second clutch 28 selectively connects<br>
the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 to the second node 20B<br>
of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the<br>
second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 to the second node 14B of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14. A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects the third<br>
node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20 to the first node 20A of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20. A fifth clutch 34 selectively connects the first node 20A of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20 to the first node 14A of the first planetary gear<br>
set 14.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Fig. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In Fig. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of Fig. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0029] For example, the planetary gear set 14 is a planetary gear set<br>
that includes a sun gear member 14A, a planet gear carrier member 14B and a<br>
ring gear member 14C. The sun gear member 14A is connected for common<br>
rotation to a first shaft or interconnecting member 52. The planet gear carrier<br>
member 14B rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D (only one shown) and<br>
is connected for common rotation with a second shaft or interconnecting member<br>
54 and output shaft 22. The planet gears 14D are configured to intermesh with<br><br>
the sun gear member 14A and the ring gear member 14C. The ring gear<br>
member 14C is permanently connected to ground or transmission housing 50<br>
through a third shaft or interconnecting member 56.<br>
[0030] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 22 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0031] The planetary gear set 16 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 16A, a planet carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a set<br>
of planet gears 16D and a ring gear member 16C. The sun gear member 16A is<br>
permanently connected to ground or transmission housing 50 through a fourth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 58 in order to restrict the sun gear member 16A<br>
from rotating relative to the ground or transmission housing 50. The planet<br>
carrier member 16B is connected for common rotation with input shaft or member<br>
12. The ring gear member 16C is connected for common rotation with the fifth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 60. The planet gears 16D are configured to<br>
intermesh with both the sun gear member 16A and the ring gear member 16C.<br>
[0032] The planetary gear set 18 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 18A, a ring gear member 18C and a planet carrier member<br>
18B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 18D. The sun gear member<br>
18A is connected for common rotation with fifth shaft or interconnecting member<br>
60. The ring gear member 18C is connected for common rotation with a sixth<br>
shaft or interconnecting member 62. The planet carrier member 18B is<br><br>
connected for common rotation with a seventh shaft or interconnecting member<br>
64 and an eighth shaft or interconnecting member 66. The planet gears 18D are<br>
configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 18A and ring gear member<br>
18C.<br>
[0033] The planetary gear set 20 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 20A, a ring gear member 20C and a planet carrier member<br>
20B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 20D. The sun gear member<br>
20A is connected for common rotation with a ninth interconnecting member 68.<br>
The ring gear member 20C is connected for common rotation with a tenth shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 70 and with sixth shaft or interconnecting member 62.<br>
The planet carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with an<br>
eleventh shaft or interconnecting member 72. The planet gears 20D are<br>
configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 20A and the ring gear<br>
member 20C.<br>
[0034] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32<br>
and 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
the first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect the eleventh<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 72 to the input member 12. The second clutch<br>
28 is selectively engageable to connect the eighth interconnecting member 66 to<br>
the eleventh interconnecting member 72. The third clutch 30 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect the second interconnecting shaft or member 54 to the<br>
seventh interconnecting member 64. The fourth clutch 32 is selectively<br><br>
engageable to connect the ninth interconnecting shaft or member 68 to the tenth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 70. The fifth clutch 34 is selectively engageable<br>
to connect the first interconnecting shaft or member 52 to the ninth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 68.<br>
[0035] Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, the operation of the embodiment<br>
of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be appreciated that<br>
transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member<br>
12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward speed or torque<br>
ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse<br>
speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 26, second clutch 28, third clutch 30,<br>
fourth clutch 32, and fifth clutch 34), as will be explained below. Fig. 3 is a truth<br>
table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the<br>
gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are also shown in Fig. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending<br>
on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0036] To establish reverse gear, the third clutch 30, the fourth clutch<br>
32, and the fifth clutch 34 are engaged or activated. The third clutch 30 connects<br><br>
the second interconnecting shaft or member 54 to the seventh interconnecting<br>
member 64. The fourth clutch 32 connects the ninth interconnecting shaft or<br>
member 68 to the tenth interconnecting shaft or member 70. The fifth clutch 34<br>
connects the first interconnecting shaft or member 52 to the ninth interconnecting<br>
shaft or member 68. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through<br>
different combinations of clutch engagement, as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
[0037] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or<br>
disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear state,<br>
between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch engaged or activated in both gear<br>
states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0038] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
