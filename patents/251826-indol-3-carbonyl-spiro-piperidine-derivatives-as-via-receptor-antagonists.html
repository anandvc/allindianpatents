as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may contain some asymmetric carbon atoms. Accordingly, the present invention includes all stereioisomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), including each of the individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
It has been found that the compounds of formula (I) have a good activity on the Via receptor. Therefore, the invention provides the use of a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of medicaments for the treatment of dysmenorrhea, hypertension, chronic heart failure, inappropriate secretion of<br><br>
vasopressin, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxious and depressive disorders.<br>
Vasopressin is a 9 amino acid peptide mainly produced by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Three vasopressin receptors, all belonging to the class I G-protein coupled receptors, are known. The Via receptor is expressed in the brain, liver, vascular smooth muscle, lung, uterus and testis, the VI b or V3 receptor is expressed in the brain and pituitary gland, the V2 receptor is expressed in the kidney where it regulates water excretion and mediates the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin.<br>
In the periphery vasopressin acts as a neurohormone and stimulates vasoconstriction, glycogenolysis and antidiuresis. In the brain vasopressin acts as a neuromodulator and is elevated in the amygdala during stress ( Ebner, K., C. T. Wotjak, et al. (2002). "Forced swimming triggers vasopressin release within the amygdala to modulate stress-coping strategies in rats." Eur J Neurosci 15(2): 384-8). The Via receptor is extensively expressed in the brain and particularly in limbic areas like the amygdala, lateral septum and hippocampus which are playing an important role in the regulation of anxiety. Indeed Via knock-out mouse show a reduction in anxious behavior in the plus-maze, open field and light-dark box ( Bielsky, I. F., S. B. Hu, et al. (2003). "Profound Impairment in Social Recognition and Reduction in Anxiety-Like Behavior in Vasopressin Via Receptor Knockout Mice." NeuropsvchopharmacologvV The downregulation of the Via receptor using antisense oligonucleotide injection in the septum also causes a reduction in anxious behavior ( Landgraf, R., R. Gerstberger, et al. (1995). "VI vasopressin receptor antisense oligodeoxynucleotide into septum reduces vasopressin binding, social discrimination abilities, and anxiety-related behavior in rats." Regul Pept 59(2): 229-39).<br>
The Via receptor is also mediating the cardiovascular effects of vasopressin in the brain by centrally regulating blood pressure and heart rate in the solitary tract nucleus (Michelini, L. C. and M. Morris (1999). "Endogenous vasopressin modulates the cardiovascular responses to exercise." Ann N Y Acad Sci 897:198-211). In the periphery it induces the contraction of vascular smooth muscles and chronic inhibition of the Via receptor improves hemodynamic parameters in myocardial infarcted rats ( Van Kerckhoven, R., I. Lankhuizen, et al. (2002). "Chronic vasopressin V(1A) but not V(2)<br><br>
receptor antagonism prevents heart failure in chronically infarcted rats." Eur J Pharmacol 449(1-2): 135-41).<br>
Thus vasopressin receptor antagonists are useful as therapeutics in the conditions of dysmenorrhea, hypertension, chronic heart failure, inappropriate secretion of vasopressin, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxious and depressive disorders.<br>
The preferred indications with regard to the present invention are the treatment of anxious and depressive disorders.<br>

General scheme D<br>
The treatment of an indole derivative (Va) with trifluoroacetic anhydride in DMF affords intermediate (VI) which can be hydrolysed with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to give the 3-carboxylic aC1-6d indole derivative (Ila). Alternatively, (VI) can react with an electrophilic reactant R'-Y to give (VII), which is then converted to the corresponding carboxylic aC1-6d derivative (lib) with NaH/H20 in DMF (see/. Org Chem., 1993, 10, 2862). Intermediate (VII) can alternatively be obtained by treatment of an indole derivative (Vb) with trifluoroacetic anhydride in DMF, dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane. Addition of a suitable base may be advantageous.<br><br><br>
Cyclization of a bromophenylacetonitrile derivative (VIII) affords a 4-bromoaryl-2-cyanopiperidine derivative (IX), The cyano group is transformed to an azidocarbonyl group using standard functional group transformations to give a compound of formula (X). Upon heating in toluene an azide (X) undergoes a Curtius rearrangement. The crude intermediate isocyanate is trapped to form a lactam of formula (XI) after bromine-lithium exchange using tert-butyllithium at -100 'C. N-Deprotection affords spiropiperidine (XII). Alternatively, lactam (XI) can be N-alkylated to give lactam (XV).

Results - Via activity Material &amp; Method:<br>
The human Via receptor was cloned by RT-PCR from total human liver RNA. The coding sequence was subcloned in an expression vector after sequenC1-6ng to confirm the identity of the amplified sequence. To demonstrate the affinity of the compounds from the present invention to the human Via receptor binding studies were performed. Cell membranes were prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the expression vector and grown in 20 liter fermenters with the following protocol.<br><br>
50g of cells are resuspended in 30ml freshly prepared ice cold Lysis buffer (50mM HEPES, ImM EDTA, lOmM MgC12 adjusted to pH= 7.4 + complete cocktail of protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)). Homogenized with Polytron for Imin and sonicated on ice for 2x 2 minutes at 80% intensity (Vibracell sonicator). The preparation is centrifuged 20 min at 500 g at 4°C, the pellet is discarded and the supernatant centrifuged Ihour at 43'OOOg at 4°C (19'000rpm). The pellet is resuspended in 12.5 ml Lysis buffer+12.5ml Sucrose 20% and homogenized using a Polytron for 1-2 min. The protein concentration is determined by the Bradford method and aliquots are stored at -80°C until use. For binding studies 60mg Yttrium silicate SPA beads (Amersham) are mixed with an aliquot of membrane in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 120mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaC12, 10 mM MgC12) for 15 minutes with mixing. 50ul of bead/membrane mixture is then added to each well of a 96 well plate, followed by 50ul of 4 nM 3H-Vasopressin (American Radiolabeled Chemicals). For total binding measurement lOOul of binding buffer are added to the respective wells, for non-speC1-6fic binding lOOul of 8.4mM cold vasopressin and for compound testing lOOul of a serial dilution of each compound in 2%DMS0. The plate is incubated Ih at room temperature, centrifuged 1 min at lOOOg and counted on a Packard Top-Count. Non-speC1-6fic binding counts are subtracted from each well and data is normalized to the maximum speC1-6fic binding set at 100%. To calculate an IC 50 the curve is fitted using a non-linear regression model (XLfit) and the Ki is calculated using the Cheng-Prussoff equation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) as well as their pharmaceutically usable aC1-6d addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically usable aC1-6d addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic exC1-6pients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic aC1-6d or its salts etc can be used as such exC1-6pients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.<br>
