(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
TRIPHENODIOXAZINE DYES<br><br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the                                   Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed <br>
TRIPHENODIOXAZIHE DYES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
5<br>
The present invention concerns the use of dyes in laundry compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Low levels of cotton substantive direct blue or violet dyes may be included in laundry detergent formulations to enhance the whiteness of cellulosic fabrics and to provide an aesthetically pleasing hue to the wash water. Several different types of azo direct dyes have been investigated. Bis-azo dyes based on benzidene chemistry may be used, as described in US3748093 (Colgate), however such dyes are now banned because they are metabolised to carcinogenic amines. Bis-azo dyes such as direct violet 51 or direct violet 9 as described in W02005/Q03274 (Unilever) and Cu complex dyes such as direct violet 66 as described in US3748093 (Colgate), may be used. Direct dyes are preferred over other classes of dye due to their strong adsorption to cellulosic fabrics.<br>
Control of the build-up of such dyes is important to avoiding over-blueing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 30 We have found that dyes based on a triphenodioxazine chromophore give more controllable build up. <br>
Triphenodioxazine dyes build up at a slower rate and are less susceptible to bleaching by singlet oxygen photobleach.es.<br>
 In one aspect the present invention provides a laundry<br>
composition comprising between 0.00001 to 0.01 wt% of a blue or violet triphenodioxazine direct dye and 2 to 70 wt% of a surfactant, wherein the triphenodioxazine direct dye is of the form:<br><br><br><br>
X<br>

X<br>
wherein the dye is substituted by 1 to 4 sulphonate groups and X is independently selected from: Cl-C6-alkyl, benzyl, F, CI, Br and I. It is preferred that both X are the same. <br>
The dye is preferably substituted by further organic groups on rings A and B.<br><br>
   It is preferred that the rings A and B are both<br>
independently substituted by a group selected from the group consisting of: -NH-Ar, wherein Ar is phenyl or naphthyl; - NH-Cl-C6-alkyl, -NH2, -Cl-C6-alkyl, -0Cl-C6-alkyl, a C3 to C4 alkyl chain linking positions 2 and 3, and a -N(R1)-C2- 15 chain linking position 2 and 3, where R1 is selected from hydrogen, and Cl-C6-alkyl.<br>
Preferred substituents for rings A and B are independently selected from the group consisting of: -NH-Ph; -NH-Me, -NH-    Et, -NH2, -Me, -Et, -OMe, -OEt, a C3 to C4 alkyl chain<br>
linking positions 2 and 3 and a -N(R1)-C2- chain linking position 2 and 3, where Rl is selected from hydrogen, Me and Et. It is these substituents for rings A and B that preferably carry 1 to 3 sulphonate groups. The aromatic <br><br>
group of the -NH-Ph may carry other substituents such as chlorine, alkoxy groups and the like.<br>
The alkyl chain linking positions 2 and 3 is preferably 5 further substituted by a phenyl ring, most preferably such that an indane group is formed. The -N(R1)-C-C- chain linking position 2 and 3 is preferably further substituted by a phenyl ring, most preferably such that an indole group is formed.<br><br>
Most preferably the triphendioxazine "direct dye has the same pattern of substitution about the A and B ring.<br>
In the A and B rings it is preferred that positions 1 and 4, 15 as indicated, are substituted by hydrogen.<br>
Two or three sulphonate groups are preferred and it is preferred that the sulphonates are present as the sodium salt.<br><br>

SINGLET OXYGEN PHOTOBLEACHES<br>
15<br>
Singlet oxygen photo-bleaches (PB) function as follows:<br>
PB + light - PB* 	PB* + $02 - PB + 1Oz<br>
The photo-bleach molecule absorbs light and attains an electronical excited state, PB*. This electronically excited state is quenched by triplet oxygen, 302, in the surroundings 25 to form singlet 102. Singlet oxygen is a highly reactive bleach.<br>
Suitable singlet oxygen photo-bleaches may be selected from, water soluble phthalocyanine compounds, particularly 30 metallated phthalocyanine compounds where the metal is Zn or Al-Zl where Z1 is a halide, sulphate, nitrate, carboxylate, <br>
alkanolate or hydroxyl ion. Preferably the phthalocyanin has 1-4 SO3X groups covalently bonded to it where X is an alkali metal or ammonium ion. Such compounds are described in W02005/014769 (Ciba).<br>
5<br>

where the dye may be substituted by halogens and other elements/groups. Particularly preferred examples are Food Red 14 (Acid Red 51), Rose Bengal, Phloxin B and Eosin Y.<br>
15 Quantum yields for photosensitized formation of singlet oxygen may be found in J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 1993, vol 22, nol ppll3-262. It is preferred if the quantum yield for singlet oxygen formation measured in an organic solvent or D20 is greater than 0.05, more preferably greater than 0.1.<br><br>
Other singlet oxygen producing compounds include chlorophyll, coumarin, porphyrins, myoglobin, riboflavin, bilirubin, and methylene blue.<br>
   The laundry composition preferably comprises from 0.00005 to 0.1 wt % of a singlet oxygen photo-bleach, more preferably 0.0002 to 0.01 wt %. This is to provide the preferred range<br>
of 1 ppb to 4 ppm of the singlet oxygen photo-bleach the in wash.<br>
The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any 5 subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non- specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive. Whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to 10 "comprising" as defined above.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be 15 understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
All experiments were conducted at room temperature, ca 2 0 °C. 20 Example 1<br>
Non-mercerised bleached white cotton sheeting, white viscose sheeting and white knitted nylon elastane were agitated together in 2g/L of a detergent formulation (containing 18% NaLAS surfactant, 73% salts (silicate, sodium tri-poly- 25 phosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including<br>
fluorescer and enzymes, remainder impurities) for 30 minutes with a liquor to cloth ration of 30:1. The wash liquor contained a direct dye, such that initial optical density of the wash solution at the maximum optical absorption of the 30 dye in the visible (400-750nm) was 1.0 with a 5cm path length. <br>
Before the washing the reflectance spectra of the cloths were read using a reflectomer (UV-light excluded). After the 1st wash the cloths were dried and the reflectance spectra were re-read. The cloths were than washed under identical conditions 4 more times and then reflectance spectrum rerecorded.<br>
The reflectance data was converted to remission function K/S using the equation:-<br>
K/S = (1-R) 21(2R)<br>
The remission function is proportional to the loading of the dye on the cloth in mol/kg when the background reflectance of the cloths is corrected for, from reading on cloths washed without dye.<br>
DCI, The increase in dye loading between the 1st and 5th wash was calculated according to the equation<br>
DCI = K/S (5th wash)/K/S (1st wash)<br>
Where the K/S value is background corrected and is at the lambda max of the dye on the cloth. <br>
The results are shown in the tables below<br>
Dye	Chromophore type	DC I cotton	DC I viscose<br>
Direct violet 9	Bis-azo	4.5	3.9<br>
Direct blue 71	Tris-azo	3.5	3.4<br>
Direct violet 66	Cu-complex	3.5	3.7<br>
Direct blue 106	Triphenodioxazine	2.9	3.2<br>
Sirius Royal BlueS {ex Dystar)	Triphenodioxazine	3.2	3.1<br><br>
The triphenodioxazine dyes show a slower build up than the other classes of dye.<br>
Example 2<br>
5 Two pieces of Korean cotton sheeting weighing a total of 3.8g were washed together in 100ml of demin. water containing 4g/L of ECE reference detergent (type A) for 30 minutes then thoroughly rinsed. The wash solution contained: a) nothing else (control) 10 b) acid red 51 + direct blue 106<br>
c)	acid red 51 + direct violet 66<br>
d)	acid red 51 + direct violet 9<br>
e)	acid red 51 + direct blue 71<br>
f)	acid red 51 + Sirius Royal Blue-S<br>
15<br>
The acid red 51 was added to give 1.7ppm in solution and the direct dyes to give a maximum optical absorption of the dye in the visible (400-750nm) of 0.5 with a 5cm path length.<br>
20 Acid red 51 is an active singlet oxygen photobleach.<br>
Following the washes 1 piece of cloth was dried in the dark and 1 piece dried in a weatherometer for 42 minutes (0.35 W/m2 at 340nm, indoor glass filter). The reflectance 25 of the clothes were then measured with a reflectometer and the dye that has been photobleached calculated. The K/S of the dye at its lambda max was calculated and values in the dark and light exposed clothes compared. (All values corrected for the background). The lambda max of the direct 30 dyes are well removed from the absorbance of acid red 51. The results are given in the table below<br>
Dye	% photobleached<br>
Direct violet 9	22<br>
Direct violet 66	25<br>
Direct blue 71	11<br>
Direct blue 106	6<br>
Sirius royal blue-S	0<br><br>
The triphenodioxazine dyes are much less susceptible to photobleaching by acid red 51.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
