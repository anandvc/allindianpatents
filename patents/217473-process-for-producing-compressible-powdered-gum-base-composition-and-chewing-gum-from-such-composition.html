				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td><br><br>
		The present invention relates to the chewing gum industry. More particularly, it<br>
	concerns an improved gum base composition in the form of a directly compressible<br>
	powder, advantageously used as a starting product for the preparation of a chewing gum.<br>
10 	Background Art<br>
		Processes for the preparation of chewing gums are widely described in the<br>
	literature. Gum base compositions constitute the essential starting ingredient for the<br>
	preparation of chewing gums. What is meant by "gum base composition" also referred to<br>
15	 as "gum base raw material" in the prior art is usually a hard, elastic material, prepared<br>
	from a mixture of various ingredients such as, in particular, natural or synthetic rubbers,<br>
	waxes, emulsifiers and plasticizers. Processes for the preparation of such gum base<br>
	compositions have been widely described in the literature, in particular in patents or<br>
	patent applications. In a general manner, the ingredients used for the preparation of such<br>
20	 gum base compositions are mixed at high temperatures with solvents, plasticizers and/or<br>
	lubricants and are further extruded or laminated. The product thus obtained, is a hard<br>
	material, physically elastic, but which cannot be handled as such.<br>
		Consequently, in a typical process for the preparation of a chewing gum, a gum<br>
	base material such as here-above described is firstly melted at temperatures ranging from<br>
25	 about 60°C to about 120°C for a period of time sufficient to render the base molten and<br>
	viscous. Then, additional ingredients useful for the preparation of a chewing gum namely,<br>
	a plasticizer, a softener, sweeteners, and/or fillers, humectants, colouring agents and<br>
	flavoring agents, are added in order to plasticize the blend as well as to modulate the<br>
	hardness, viscoelasticity and the formability of the base. Mixing is continued until a<br>
30	 uniform mixture is obtained. Thereafter, the mixture is cooled, pressed and cut and may<br>
	be formed into desirable chewing gum shapes.<br>
		This type of process involves a treatment at high temperatures which has the<br>
	drawback of being the cause of degradation of heat sensitive ingredients present in the<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 	PCT/IB2003/005027<br>
2<br>
	composition including active agents and flavours. Moreover, these methods require for<br>
	their carrying out a particular and expensive equipment.<br>
		Alternative processes for the preparation of chewing gums and more particularly<br>
	for the treatment or handling of a gum base raw material have been suggested in the prior<br>
5	 art, in particular in US 5,866,179 or yet in US 5,711,961. These patents disclose<br>
	processes for the preparation of chewing gums comprising as a first step the cooling of a<br>
	gum base raw material, followed by its grinding, prior to incorporating other ingredients.<br>
	For instance, US 5,711,961 describes a method for preparing a tablet comprising the steps<br>
	of freezing a gum base raw material to a temperature of between -20 and -25°C, and then<br>
10	grinding said frozen gum in order to make it suitable to be admixed with other chewing<br>
	gum ingredients. In such processes, the cooling step, essential to transform the raw<br>
	material in a suitable form to be further processed, is a costly and time consuming<br>
	treatment.<br>
		Moreover, in all the processes disclosed in the prior art, the gum base raw<br>
15	 material, even after a heating or a cooling treatment, is still in a form which is not suitable<br>
	for the preparation of a chewing gum. In other words, the gum base raw material thus<br>
	treated is not yet in a compressible form. Consequently, adjuvants have to be added<br>
	during the chewing gum preparation to make the formulation compressible.<br>
		Therefore, in view of the disadvantages presented by the processes available until<br>
20	 now, improvements, in particular a way to avoid the heating or cooling treatments of a<br>
	gum base raw material and/or a way to provide a material which would be directly<br>
	compressible, would be of high importance for the industry.<br>
		More recently, WO 02/069729 has described a process for making a "particulate<br>
	blend gum base". The process consists in providing a dry blend of gum base ingredients<br>
25	 including elastomers, plasticizers, resins, fats and oils, waxes, softeners and inorganic<br>
	fillers, by grinding, extruding and grinding and/or spray congealing these ingredients, and<br>
	then blending them to form the particulate gum base. The choice of the method carried<br>
	out to prepare a powder form of the gum base ingredients, depends on the softening<br>
	points of the treated ingredients. For instance mixtruding is carried out typically with an<br>
30	 elastomer plasticizer and a hard elastomer. These methods thus consist in treating the<br>
	ingredients constituting a gum base raw material to provide a powdered gum base<br>
	material ready to be used and tableted. However, the way to proceed disclosed in this<br>
	document requires a lot of equipments. In fact, a variety of methods has to be possibly<br>
	carried out, the choice of a particular one depending on the nature of the gum base<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 	PCT/IB2003/005027<br>
3<br>
	ingredients. It could thus be useful to have a simpler method of providing a powder form<br>
	of gum base ingredients suitable for any kind of ingredients.<br>
		Now, we have been able to provide a very simple method, suitable whatever the<br>
	nature (in particular softening point) of the gum base ingredients, and which allows to<br>
5	 prepare a gum base composition which is advantageously directly compressible. The<br>
	process is both fast and inexpensive and avoids any particular external heating or cooling<br>
	steps.<br>
	Disclosure of the Invention<br>
10<br>
		Therefore, a first object of the present invention is a process for transforming an<br>
	uncompressible gum base raw material into a compressible powdered gum base<br>
	composition comprising, in weight percent, up to 85% of a synthetic and/or natural<br>
	uncompressible gum base raw material, from 1 to 16% of a silicate derivative and from 4<br>
15	 to 30% of a polyol. The process of the invention comprises the steps of mixing the<br>
	synthetic and/or natural uncompressible gum base raw material with the powdered<br>
	silicate derivative and the polyol at a temperature comprised between 15 and 30°C;<br>
	letting the warm agglomerate cool down to room temperature to obtain a hard<br>
	agglomerated mixture; and finally grinding the hard agglomerated mixture to obtain a<br>
20	 compressible powder. In a particular embodiment, the powder obtained is further<br>
	subjected to a sieving.<br>
		The term "gum base composition" as used in the present invention, is not to be<br>
	understood as designating, as it is the case most of the time in the prior art, the gum base<br>
	raw material, described above as a hard, and not easy to handle material. Conversely it is<br>
25 	used to designate the final product obtained at the end of the process, namely a ready-to-<br>
	be-compressed powdered composition.<br>
		The starting material used in the process of the invention, herein referred to as<br>
	"gum base raw material" or as "synthetic and/or natural gum material", is a hard,<br>
	uncompressible material usually commercially available. The process herein described<br>
30	 consists in transforming the latter raw material into the compressible gum base<br>
	composition of the invention. Therefore, contrary to what is disclosed in WO 02/069729,<br>
	the process of the present invention uses as starting product said commercially available<br>
	gum base raw material, which consists of a mixture of elastomers, fillers, plasticizers etc.<br>
	but which is in a form which is not suitable to handle. Thus, the process does not consist<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 	PCT/IB2003/005027<br>
4<br>
	in treating the ingredients constituting the gum base raw material, but in transforming<br>
	directly an uncompressible gum base raw material into a compressible gum base<br>
	composition, ready to be tableted in a chewing gum.<br>
		The gum base composition prepared by the process according to the present<br>
5	 invention presents first of all the advantage of being directly compressible. It is of<br>
	common knowledge in this field that in the normal course of developing formulations for<br>
	chewing gums, and the routine production of tablets, processing problems occur.<br>
	Capping, lamination, picking and sticking, poor compressibility and flowability are the<br>
	most common processing problems. In order to improve compression of the formulations,<br>
10	 ingredients used to facilitate compression are usually added at different stages of the<br>
	preparation of a chewing gum, together with other formulation ingredients.<br>
		Conversely, the product provided by the present invention is directly<br>
	compressible, i.e. that it is provided in the form of a fine powder, which can thus be dry<br>
	blended with other ingredients required in the final product formulation, also in a powder<br>
15	 form, such as flavours, sweeteners or pharmaceutically active ingredients. The blend<br>
	there-obtained can be simply and easily compressed to provide chewing gum tablets,<br>
	without requiring any costly or complicated process and equipment. Therefore, the<br>
	directly compressible powder of the invention allows the preparation of chewing tablets<br>
	while avoiding any step such as heating that could be responsible for the degradation of<br>
20	 the ingredients present in the formulation.<br>
		More objects, aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from<br>
	the detailed description hereafter,<br>
		The synthetic and/or natural gum material or gum base raw material employed as<br>
	starting product for the process of the invention, is a usually commercially available<br>
25	 uncompressible raw material, typically containing polymers, polymer solvents, fats and<br>
	oils, waxes, softeners and inorganic fillers. Examples of polymers used in this kind of<br>
	product include for instance, butyl elastomers, polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
	copolymer and styrene butadiene rubber elastomer. Polymer solvents include terpene<br>
	resins, ester gums or yet resin esters. Waxes such as paraffin, microcrystalline and natural<br>
30	 waxes such as beeswax, candelilla, camauba and polyethylene wax may be used. The fats<br>
	and oils suitable within the framework of the preparation of such raw materials include<br>
	for instance tallow, soybean or cottonseed oils, hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated<br>
	vegetable oils. Usable softeners include glycerol monostearate, lecithin, or mono-, di- and<br>
	triglycerol esters of fatty acids. Finally, the inorganic fillers present in a gum base raw<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 	PCT/IB2003/005027<br>
5<br>
	material include for instance talc, dicalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium<br>
	carbonate and other well-known in the art.<br>
		Many synthetic and/or natural gum materials which may be used within the<br>
	framework of the invention are commercially available products on sale under, in<br>
5	 particular, the tradenames Sierra®, Nevada®, Apolo®-T, Balear®-T, Fantasy® T, Marfil®<br>
	and Mallorca®, (origin: Cafosa, Spain).<br>
		Many types of gum base raw materials suit the purpose of the invention. The<br>
	choice of a particular material will vary greatly, depending upon various factors such as<br>
	the type of base desired (chewing gum or bubble gum), the consistency of gum desired<br>
10	 and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
	product.<br>
		The gum base raw material is present within the gum base composition of the<br>
	invention in an amount rising up to 85%, and is preferably present in an amount ranging<br>
	between 40 and 70% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. The<br>
15	 presence of a high load of gum base raw material in the composition is an unexpected and<br>
	advantageous characteristic of the invention. In fact, most of the gum base compositions<br>
	known up to date contain much less gum base raw material. Now, given that during<br>
	consumption, namely when the product is chewed, most of the components present in the<br>
	chewing gum formulation quickly dissolve and are thus released from the product and<br>
20	 swallowed by the consumer, the gum base raw material is, in the end, the only ingredient<br>
	which remains in the mouth of the consumer. Ideally, this chewable part should thus<br>
	constitute a relatively important amount of matter, so that the product keeps elasticity,<br>
	mastication texture and cohesiveness during consumption. This requirement has besides<br>
	to be balanced with the need to provide a product of reasonable size. In fact, the less gum<br>
25	 base raw material is present in the gum base composition, the more quantity of gum base<br>
	composition is needed for the preparation of a chewing gum and therefore the bigger will<br>
	be the final product, in order to satisfy the consumer demand in terms of amount of<br>
	matter to chew after all the other compounds have dissolved. Therefore, it can be easily<br>
	understood that a gum base composition containing a high load of gum base raw material<br>
30	 allows to produce a final end product of reasonable size, satisfying at the same time the<br>
	requirement here-above described. In other words, a gum base composition comprising a<br>
	high percentage of gum base raw material (here-above designated as natural and/or<br>
	synthetic gum material) allows to prepare a chewing gum of reasonable size, while<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 	PCT/IB2003/005027<br>
6<br>
	providing to the consumer sufficient matter to chew, even after the other ingredients of<br>
	the formulation have dissolved.<br>
		Apart from the gum base raw material, the powdered gum base composition<br>
	according to the invention further comprises from 1 to 16% by weight relative to the total<br>
5	 weight of the composition of a silicate derivative, and from 4 to 30% of a polyol.<br>
		In a particular embodiment, the silicate derivative is present in the composition in<br>
	an amount comprised between 2 and 14% by weight relative to the total weight of the<br>
	composition. Non limiting examples of silicate derivatives suitable for the purpose of the<br>
	invention include silicon dioxide, magnesium silicate, aluminium silicate and sodium<br>
10	 silicate. In one particular embodiment, one will use silicon dioxide, commercialised<br>
	under the name Syloid® by W.R. Grace and Company, Davison Chemical Division.<br>
		In another embodiment, the powdered composition of the invention comprises<br>
	from 6 to 25% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition of a polyol.<br>
	Suitable polyols include but are not limited to sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, maltitol and<br>
15	 " mixtures thereof.<br>
		In a particular way of carrying out the invention, one will use sorbitol.<br>
	Apart from the three essential ingredients mentioned above, the gum base<br>
	composition of the invention may comprise additional, optional ingredients such as, for<br>
	instance, colorants, pigments or yet sweeteners.<br>
20 		The main object of the invention is provided by a novel process for the<br>
	transformation of an uncompressible gum base raw material into a compressible<br>
	powdered gum base composition as defined above. The process of the invention<br>
	comprises the steps of mixing an uncompressible synthetic and/or natural gum material<br>
	with a powdered silicate derivative and a solid polyol at ambient temperature, to provide<br>
25	 a warm agglomerated paste; letting the warm agglomerate cool down to room<br>
	temperature to obtain a hard agglomerated mixture; and grinding the hard agglomerated<br>
	mixture to provide a compressible powder.<br>
		The powdered silicate derivative is characterised by an average particle size,<br>
	typically below 50 μm.<br>
30 		The process according to the present invention is very simple and cheap, and<br>
	allows to provide a product in the form of a fine powder which presents the advantage of<br>
	being directly compressible. Contrary to the processes disclosed in the prior art, the<br>
	process of the present invention does not make use of external energy through a heating<br>
	or a cooling treatment of the synthetic and/or natural, hard starting gum material. On the<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 	PCT/IB2003/005027<br>
7<br>
	other hand, it does not require the equipment needed when the elastomers, fillers and<br>
	plasticizers are initially put into a paniculate form as described in WO 02/069729. The<br>
	starting material is in the present case a synthetic or natural uncompressible gum material<br>
	of composition chosen as a function of the desired application, which is simply<br>
	S introduced in a mixer such as, for instance, a twin blade mixer, together with a silicate<br>
	derivative and a polyol, both in a powder form. The mixing is carried out at ambient<br>
	temperature, i.e. a temperature typically comprised between 15 and 30°C. While no<br>
	heating or cooling is provided, the shear force consequent to the mixing warms the<br>
	mixture up to a temperature typically varying around 50°C. The resulting product of this<br>
10	 first step of the process is in the form of a warm agglomerated paste which has lost the<br>
	elastic physical property typical of the gum base raw material, and which is now in a<br>
	plastic physical state. The obtained warm agglomerated paste is, in the second step of the<br>
	process, simply left at ambient air, in order to cool it down to room temperature.<br>
	Alternatively, the agglomerated paste may be cooled down by any other means, such as<br>
15	 by means of a freezer. Once cooled down, the hard agglomerates have simply to be<br>
	grinded in order to provide a fine powder. The grinding step can be carried out using any<br>
	kind of apparatus well known in the art. Following the grinding step, the powder is<br>
	subjected to a homogenisation step by means, for instance, of a mill. The obtained<br>
	product presents the advantage of being homogeneous and in the form of a compressible<br>
20	 powder with a particle size usually comprised between 50 and 500 μm.<br>
		The homogeneous powdered gum base composition obtained from the process<br>
	above-described may be advantageously used for the preparation of a chewing gum.<br>
		A chewing gum comprising approximately from 15 to 80% by weight of gum<br>
	base composition according to the invention, and from about 20 to about 85% by weight<br>
25	 of a composition of additives for chewing gum is another object of the invention. What is<br>
	meant here by a "composition of additives for chewing gum" is typically a composition<br>
	comprising sweeteners and flavouring ingredients used to improve, enhance or modify<br>
	the organoleptic properties of the final product, as well as other optional ingredients such<br>
	as fillers, colouring agents, etc. Sweetening agents may be selected from a wide range of<br>
30	 materials including water-soluble agents, water-soluble artificial sweeteners and<br>
	dipeptide-based sweeteners, also including mixtures thereof. As regards the flavouring<br>
	ingredients, both synthetic and natural flavouring agents derived from plants, leaves,<br>
	flowers, fruits etc. and combinations thereof are useful. Specific examples of such<br>
	flavouring components may be found in the current literature, e.g. in Perfume and<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 PCT7IB2003/005027<br>
8<br>
	Flavour Chemicals by S.Arctander, Montclair N.J. (USA); Fenaroli's Handbook of<br>
	Flavour Ingredients, CRC Press or synthetic Food Adjuncts by M.B.Jacobs, van<br>
	Nostrand Co. Inc.. Such ingredients are well known to the person skilled in the art of<br>
	flavouring and/or aromatising consumer products, i.e. of imparting an odour or taste to a<br>
5	 consumer product.<br>
		In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the flavouring<br>
	ingredients used in the preparation of a chewing gum according to the invention are in a<br>
	solid or microencapsulated form. In fact, as the starting gum base composition is in a<br>
	powder form, it may be easily blended with another powder and then compressed to<br>
10	 provide chewing gum tablets. Therefore, flavouring ingredients or compositions<br>
	employed to impart a taste to chewing gums can be used within the framework of the<br>
	invention, in the form of spray-dried solids, or in other powder forms, i.e. in encapsulated<br>
	forms. Flavouring ingredients in an encapsulated form are advantageously protected from<br>
	degradation processes such as oxidation. Moreover, a flavouring ingredient in an<br>
15	 encapsulated form presents the advantage of providing a controlled release of the active<br>
	ingredient there-encapsulated, which is a key issue in a product such as a chewing gum.<br>
		A process for the preparation of a chewing gum, starting from the gum base<br>
	composition here-above described, is also an object of the present invention. Such a<br>
	process comprises, in particular, the steps of dry blending a powdered gum base<br>
20	 composition according to the invention, together with other powdered ingredients such as<br>
	flavouring ingredients or compositions, or sweeteners, and compressing the obtained<br>
	mixture. The compression step may be carried out by means of any compression<br>
	equipment, typically used in the industry, a more detailed description not being required<br>
	here, the skilled person being capable of choosing the right equipment and adapting it as<br>
25	 a function of his needs. The chewing gum obtained by such a process advantageously<br>
	possesses a homogeneous composition, which proved to be advantageous as regards the<br>
	release of active ingredients such as flavours.<br>
		As mentioned above, the powdered gum base composition of the invention<br>
	particularly suits the preparation of chewing gum wherein the flavour is in the form of a<br>
30	 powder (prepared by spray-drying, extrusion or other encapsulation method), as the latter<br>
	may be simply dry blended with the starting gum composition before being compressed.<br>
	The fact to prepare chewing gums starting from dry blended powders presents the<br>
	advantage of avoiding any contamination of the equipment used in the mixing process,<br>
	which contamination occurs when liquid flavour are used. Besides, the powdered<br><br>
WO 2004/040995 	PCT/IB2003/005027<br>
9<br>
	ingredients used in the process for the preparation of chewing gums according to the<br>
	invention such as flavour ingredients or compositions or yet sweeteners, will<br>

	Total	255	100<br>
	1) origin: Cafosa, Spain<br>
25	 2) origin: W.R. Grace Company; Davison Chemical Division.<br>
		The sorbitol, Syloid® 244 and icing sugar were premixed in a Turbula blender. The<br>
	Balear®-T gum was put in a Winkworth sigma-blade mixer set at 30°C. The gum was<br>
	sheared until a temperature of 50-55° was reached. The premixed powder was added and<br>
30	 mixed with the gum base raw material until a homogeneous system was obtained in the<br>
	form of a stringy paste, after approximately 5 min. The agglomerated mix was removed<br>
	from the sigma-blade mixer and let to cool down to room temperature. Once the<br>
	equilibrium was reached, the coarse particles were milled in a hammer mill and the<br>
	resulting powder was sieved through a 1 mm sieve.<br><br>
