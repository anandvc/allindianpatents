PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS"<br>
• ****•<br>
The present invention relates to novel steroidal compounds for systemic use and non systemic use, and their compositions, to be used in the conditions of oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfuntions. Specifically it relates to compounds with a steroidal structure having antiinflammatory, immunodepressive and angiostatic activity (the so called antiinflammatory steroids), or gastrointestinal activity.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention result therapeutically useful in the treatment of morbid conditions wherein the steroidal products are generally used with greater benefit, in terms both of a better tolerability and/or efficacy.<br>
By oxidative stress it is meant the generation of free radicals or. radicalic compounds, which causes injury both of the cell and of that of the surrounding tissue (Pathophysiology: the biological basis for disease in adults and children, McCance &amp;  Huether 1998 pages 48-54).<br>
By endothelial dysfunctions are meant those relating to the vasal endothelium. The damage of the vasal endothelium is known as one of those important events that can bring about a series of pathological processes affecting various organs and<br><br>
body apparatuses, as described hereinafter (Pathophysiology: The biological basis for disease in adults and children, McCance &amp; Huether 1998  page  1025).<br>
As known, the oxidative stress and/or the endothelial dysfunctions are associated to various pathologies as reported hereinafter. The oxidative stress can also be caused by toxicity of a great variety of drugs, which significantly affects  their  performances.<br>
Said pathological events are of a chronic, debilitating character and are very of then typical of the elderly. As already said, in said pathological conditions the drugs used show a  remarkably worsened  performance.<br>
Examples of pathological situations caused by the oxidative stress and/or by the endothelial dysfunctions, or present in elderly,   are  the following:<br>
For   the   cardiovascular   system:   myocardial   and   vascular<br>
ischaemia   in general,   hypertension,   stroke,   arterioscle-<br>
■« -. rosis,   etc.<br>
For the, connective tissue: rheumatoid arthritis and connected   inflammatory diseases,   etc.<br>
For the pulmonary system: asthroa and connected inflammatory diseases,   etc.<br>
For the gastrointestinal system: ulcerative and non ulcerative dyspepsias, intestinal inflammatory diseases, etc.<br><br>
For the central nervous system: Alzheimer disease, etc.<br>
For the urogenital system: impotence, incontinence.<br>
For the cutaneous system: eczema, neurodermatitis, acne.<br>
The infective diseases in general (ref.: Schwarz-KB, Brady<br>
"Oxidative stress during viral infection: A review" Free<br>
radical Biol. Med. 21/5,.641-649 1996).<br>
Further the ageing process can be considered as a true pathologic condition (ref. Pathophysiology: the biological basis for disease in adults and children, pages 71-77).<br>
The known drugs when administered to patients having pathologies associated to oxidative stress emd/or endothelial dysfunctions, show a lower efficacy and/or higher toxicity.<br>
This happenss for example with steroids.<br>
Drug research is directed to find new molecules having ajn improved therapeutic index (efficacy/toxicity ratio) or a lower risk/benefit ratio, also for pathological conditions as those above mentioned, wherein the therapeutic index of a great number of drugs results lowered. In fact in the above mentioned conditions o'f oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, many drugs show a lower activity and/or higher toxicity.<br>
It is well known that steroids represent a first choice pharmacological intervention in the therapy of inflammatory diseases. This class of drugs, among which can be mentioned for example hydrocortisone, cortisone, prednisone,   prednisolone, fludrocortisone,    desoxycorticosterone,  metilprednisolone.<br><br>
triamcinolone, paramethasone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, beclomethasone, acetoxypregnelone, etc. , elicits remarkable pharmaco-toxicological effects on different organs, and for this reason both their clinical use and its interruption cause a series of side effects, some of which very serious. See for example Goodman &amp; Gilman, "The pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics"  9th ed. , pages 1459-1465, 1996.<br>
Among said toxic effects can be mentioned those affecting the bone tissue leading to esi altered cellular metabolism and an high osteoporosis . incidence; those affecting the cardiovascular system, generating an hypertensive response; those affecting the gastrointestinal apparatus giving gastric damages.<br>
See for example Martindale "The extrapharmacopoeia", 30th ed., pages 712-723, 1993.<br>
To the class of steroidal drugs belong also biliary acids, that, have been used in the therapy of hepatic disorders and in biliary coli-cs. Ursodesoxycholic acid is also used in some hepatic dysfunctions (hepatic cirrhosis of biliary origin, etc.). Their tolerability is strongly worsened in the presence of gastrointestinal complications (chronic hepatic damage, peptic ulcer, intestinal inflammation, etc.). Also in the case of biliary acids the oxidative stress remarkably affects drug performance:  both the efficacy and  the  tolerability of<br><br>
chenodeoxycholic and ursodesoxycholic acids are significantly reduced. In particular the unwanted effects on liver are found exalted. Among the steroidal compounds can be mentioned also estrogens for the treatment of dislipidaemiaS/ hormonal troubles, female apparatus tiomours treatment can be mentioned. Also said steroids show side effects as above mentioned, in particular at the hepatic level.<br>
According to the above mentioned prior art it seems almost impossible to separate therapeutic activity from side effects, see Goodman et al, above mentioned, at p. 1474.<br>
The steroidal compounds are completely different from the antiinflammatory non steroidal compounds from the chemical, pharmacological and biochemical point of view, since the pharmaco-toxicological mechanism of action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory products is based on the inhibition of one or more of the cyclooxygenases (COX), while steroids do not<br>
influence COX and have more complex pharmaco-toxicological<br>
*-• -<br>
mechanisms  of  action    not yet  fully cleared.<br>
Indeed "it is well known that these two groups of drugs are classified  in different classes   in the pharmacopoeias.<br>
The need was felt to have available steroids showing an improved therapeutic performance, i.e. endowed both of a lower toxicity and/or higher efficacy, so that they could be administered to patients in morbid conditions of oxidative stress   and/or   endothelial   dysfunctions,   without   showing   the<br><br>
drawbacks of the drugs of the prior art.<br>
It has been now surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the aforementioned technical problems shown in the administration of steroidal drugs to patients affected by oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfiinctions, or to the elderly in general, are solved by a new class of drugs as described hereinafter.<br>

The   precursors of B or B2 which meet test 4,  are preferred-<br>
The tests carried out to identify the precursors of B or Bi are in detail the following:<br>
Test 4 is a colorimetric test which affords to establish whether nhe precursors of B or B1 inhibit the production of radicals from DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-l-picryl-hydra2yl) (M.S. Nenseter et Al. , Atheroscler. Thromb. 15, 1338-1344, 1S95). 100 μM solutions in methanol of the tested substances are prepared, and an aliquot of each of said solutions is added to a DPPH solution in methanol 0.1 M. After having stored the solutions at room temperature away from, light for 30 minutes, their absorbances are read at the wave length of 517 nm, together with that of the corresponding DPPK solution at the same concentration. The absorbance decrease with respect to that of the solution of DPPH at the same concentration of the test solutions is determined. The effectiveness of the tested compound in inhibiting formation of radicals by DPPH is expressed by the following fonuula:<br>
(1 - A3/Ac)X100 wherein As and Ac are respectively the absorbance values of the solution containing the test compound together with DPPH and of<br><br>
the solution containing only DPPK; the compounds precursor of B or B1 meet test 4 when the inhibition percentage of radical production from DP?H, expressed as a percentage according to the above equation, is higher than or equal co 50% at the indicated concentration (10-4 M) .<br>
If the precursors of B or B1 do not meet test 4, test 5 is carried out.<br>
Test 5 is a colorimetric test wherein 0.1 ml aliquots of 10-4 M methanolic solutions of the tested products are added to test tubes containing a solution formed by 0.2 ml of 2 mM desoxyribose, 0.4 ml of phosphate buffer pK 7.4 100 mM and 0.1 ml of 1 mM Fe--(NH4)2(SO4)2 in 2mM KCl. The test tubes are then maintained at 37oC for one hour. Then in each test tube 0.5 ml of a 2.8% solution in trichloroacetic acid water and 0.5 ml of an aqueous 0.1 M solution of thiobarbituric acid are added, in the order. A reference blank is formed by adding to a test tube containing only the above described aqueous solution of reactants 0.1 ml of methanol. The test tubes are closed and heated in an oil bath at 100oC for 15 minutes.

The compounds of the invention can be used in the same therapeutic indications of the precursor drug with the above mentioned advantages.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or (II) are prepared by<br>
synthesis methods mentioned hereinunder.<br>
The choice of the reactions for each method depends on the reactive group present in the steroid molecule, in the precursor compound of B or B1, which can be, as above mentioned/ bivalent or monovalent, and in the precursor compound of C.<br>
The reactions are carried out with well known methods in the prior art, which allow to obtain bonds among the steroid, the precursor compound of B or B1 and the precursor compound of<br><br>
C as above defined.<br>
When the reactive function of the steroid (for example<br>
-COOK, -OH) is involved in a covalent bond,- for example of<br>
ester, amide, ether type, said function can be restored with<br>
the well known methods in the prior art.<br>
Some synthesis schemes for obtaining the compounds of the<br>
invention are reported hereinafter:<br>
A) Synthesis of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
1. Synthesis of the compound obtained by reaction between the steroid and the compound precursor of B.<br>
la. When the steroid contains a carboxylic function (general formula: R-COOH) and the functional group of the precursor compound of B which binds itself to the carboxylic function has the formula XZ, X being as above defined and Z = H, the effected reactions depend, on the nature of the second reactive group present in the precursor compound of B.<br>
la.i When the second reactive group present in the precursor compound of B is a carboxylic group, the synthesis general scheme expects the initial formation of the acyl halide of the R-COHal steroid (Hal = CI, Br) and the subsequent reaction with the HX group of the precursor compound of B:<br>
RCOOK	 RCOHal + H-X-X2-COOH	^<br>
R-T3-X2-COOH      (lA.l)<br><br>
X2,   TB being as above defined.<br>
When in the two reaction compounds other functional groups COOH and/or HZ are present, they must be protected before the reaction according to the methods known in the prior art; for example as described in the publication by Th. W. Greene: 'Protective groups in organic synthesis", Harward University Press,   1980.<br>
The RCOHal acylhalide is prepared according to the known methods in the prior art, for example by thionyl or oxalyl chloride, PIII or Pv halides in inert solvents under the reaction conditions, such as for example toluene, chloroform,   DMF,   etc.<br>
Specifically, when the HX group of the precursor compound of B is NH2, or OH or SH, the steroid of formula R-COOH is first converted into the corresponding acyl halide RCOHal, as above mentioned, and then reacted with the HX group of the precursor compound of B in the presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine, pyridine, etc. using an inert solvent in the reaction conditions such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran,   etc.   at a temperature  in the  range  0oC-<br>
25oC.<br>
Alternatively to the previous synthesis, the steroid of formula R-COOH can be treated with an agent activating the carboxyl group selected from N,N' -carbonyldiimidazol (CDI), N-hydroxybenzotriazol and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide<br><br>
in solvent such as for example DMF, TKF, chloroform etc. at a temperature in the range -5oC - 50oC and the obtained coinmpound reacted in situ with the reactive function of the precursor compound of B for obtaining the compound of formula (lA.l). la. 2 When the precursor compound of 3 contains two functional groups XZ, equal to or different from each other, X being as above defined and Z = H, the steroid having formula R-COOK is first treated with an agent activating the carboxyl group, as above described in la-1, and then with the precursor compound of B, after having protected one of the two reactive HX groups, for example with acetyl or tert-butyloxycarbonyl, restoring the initial function at the synthesis end. The scheme is the following:<br><br>
wherein X, TgT X2 are as above defined and G is a protective group of the HX function.<br>
2.   Nitroxyderivative synthesis.<br>
2a. 1 When the compound obtained at the end of the previous step •la. has formula (lA.l), the acid can be converted into the corresponding sodic salt and one can then follow the known prior art methods for preparing the final compound, for example according to one of the following synthesis schemes:<br><br><br>
wherein T3, X2, TB1, TC are as above defined; R4 is selected from CI, Br, Y is as above defined, Z- is the Y radical free from the oxygen atom, R3 is CI, Er, Iodine, OK. If R3 = OH the compound of formula (lA.lb) is subje-cted to halogenation, for example with PBr3, PCI5, SOCI2, PPh3 ^ ±2, and then reacted with AgN03 in organic solvent such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran. If R3 is CI, Br, Iodine, the compound of formula (lA.lb) is directly react ed with AgN03 as above mentioned.<br><br>
wherein R5 = OH or NHR^^^, R^c/ % ^^^ the other symbols being as above defined.<br>
When X^ is a linear C4 alkyl, the corresponding acid R-T^-X-7-COOK is reacted with triphenylphosphine in the presence of an halogenating agent such as CBr4 or N-bro-mosuccinimide in tetrahydrof uran obtaining the compound<br><br>
(lA.lc) wher;ein R3 = Br, 2a. 2 When the compound obtained at the end cf the previous step la. has formula (IA.2), the corresponding nitroxyderiva-tive is obtained by treating an halogen-carboxylic acid of formula Kal-X-_-COOH, X- being as above defined, first with an agent activating the carboxyl group as described in lA.l, and then with the compound of formula (IA.2), obtaining an halogen derivative, which is isolated and then dissolved in organic solvent, (ref. paragraph 2a.1), and treated with silver nitrate. The global reaction scheme is the following:<br><br>
wherein T3, X2,   TBI, Tc, Y are as above defined.<br>
Alternatively, the halide Hal-X^-COCl can be used, wherein , Hal is preferably bromine, which is let react with the<br>
compound of formula (lA.2). lb.  When the reactive function of the steroid is -OH (general<br>
formula: R-OH) , the two functional groups present on the<br>
precursor compound of B can be the following: lb. 1 A carboxylic group, which reacts with the steroid OH<br>

precursor compound of B being equal to or different from<br><br>
the steroid functional group. The formula of the precursor compound of B is of the K-X-X2-COOH type, wherein X and X2 are as above defined.<br>

Test 4: inhibition of the radical production from DPPH of some substances used to prepare the precursors of B or Bl<br>
The method is based or. a colorimetric test in which DPPH<br><br>
(2,2-diphenyl-l-picryl-hydrazyl) is used as the compound-forming radicals (M.S. Nenseter et Al. , Atheroscler. Thrcmb. 15, 1338-1344, 1995).<br>
Solutions in methanol of the tested substances at a final concentration lOQ pK are initially prepared. 0.1 ml of each of these solutions are added to aliquots of 1 ml of a methanol solution C.l M of D?PH and then the final volume is brought to 1.5 ml. Afcer having stored the solutions at room temperature away from light for 30 minutes, the absorbance at the wave length of 517 nm is read. It is determined the absorbance decrease with respect to the absorbance of a solution containing che same concentration of DPPH.<br>
The efficacy of the test compound to inhibit the production of radicals; otherwise said antiradical activity, is expressed by the following formula:<br>
(1 - A3/Ac)X100 wherein As and Ac are, respectively, the absorbance values of the solution containing the test compound together + DPPH and * of the solution containing only DPPH.<br>
The compound to be used as precursor of B or B1 according to the present invention meets test 4 if it inhibits radical production from DPPH in a percent equal to or higher than 50%.<br>
In Table III are reported the results obtained in said test with the following compounds: N- acetylcysteine, cysteine, ferulic acid,  (L) -carnosine, gentisic acid,  4-thiazolidin<br><br>
carboxylic acid and 2-oxc-4-thiazolidincarboxylic acid.<br>
Table III shows t-he following:<br>
N-acetylcysteine, cysteine, ferulic acid, (L)-carnosine, gentisic acid meet rest 4 since they inhibit the production of radicals induced by DPPH ro an extent higher than 50%. Therefore they can be used as precursors of the B compound in the synthesis of che ccnpc-m-ds according to the present invention.<br>
4-thia2olidin carboxylic acid and the 2-oxo-4-thia2olidin carboxylic acid do not meet test 4 since they do not inhibit<br><br><br><br>
solution containing the nested compound + the iron salt and that of the solution containing only the iron salt.<br>
The results are reported in Table IV, which shows that both acids meet test 5 since they inhibit radical production from FeII in a percentage higher than 50%. Therefore both 4-thiazolidin carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-4-thia2olidin carboxylic acid can be used as precursors of B, B1 or C = -T1-Y-H for obtaining compounds of the present invention, EXAMPLE F4<br>
Example Fl was repeated with three groups of rats (each group of of ten animals) , one control group not receiving L-NMIE and two groups receiving L-NAMZ, and i.p. administered as it<br><br>
