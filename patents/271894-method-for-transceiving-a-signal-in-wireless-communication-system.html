BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a signal transmitting method, and more<br>
particularly, to a method of transmitting a signal in a wireless communication system using<br>
a prescribed frame structure.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0003| Generally, IEEE 802.16m system is able to support FDD (frequency<br>
division duplex) including H-FDD (half-frequency division duplex) mobile station<br>
operation and TDD time division duplex) both. The IEEE 802.16m system uses OFDMA<br>
(orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access) as a multiple access scheme in DL<br>
(downlink) and UL (uplink). Contents for OFDMA parameters are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0004] [Table 1]<br>
[0005] In the following description, a frame structure of the IEEE 802.16m system<br>
is schematically explained.<br>
[0006] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a basic frame structure in IEEE 802.16m system.<br>
[0007] Referring to FIG. 1, each 20ms super frame is divided into four 5ms radio<br>
frames equal to each other in size. And, the corresponding super frame starts with a super<br>
frame header (SFH). In case of using the same OFDMA parameters of Table 1 within a<br>
channel bandwidth selected from 5MHz, 10MHz and 20MHz, each of the 5ms radio frames<br>
is constructed with eight subframes. One subframe can be allocated for downlink or uplink<br>
transmission. A first type can be defined as a subframe including 6 OFDMA symbols. A<br>
second type can be defined as a subframe including 7 OFDMA symbols. And, a third type<br>
can be defined as a subframe including 5 OFDMA symbols.<br>
[0008] A basic frame structure is applicable to FDD including H-FDD mobile<br>
station operation and TOD both. The number of switching points in each radio frame of<br>
TDD system is 2. The switching point can be defined according to a change of directionality<br>
from downlink to uplink or uplink to downlink.<br>
[0009] H-FDD mobile station can be included in FDD system. A frame structure in<br>
viewpoint of the H-FDD mobile station is similar to a TDD frame structure. Yet, downlink<br>
and uplink transmissions occur in two individual frequency bands. Transmission gaps<br>
between downlink and uplink (and vice versa) are requested to switch transmitting and<br>
receiving circuits to each other.<br>
fOOlOJ FrG. 2 is a diagram for an example of TDD frame having a DL-to-UL ratio<br>
set to 5:3.<br>
[0011] Referring to FIG. 2, assuming that an OFDMA symbol duration is 102.857<br>
u.s and that a CP (cyclic prefix) length is set to a length corresponding to 1/8 of a useful<br>
symbol length (Tu), lengths of first and second type subframes are 0.617 ms and 0.514 ms,<br>
respectively. A last DL (downlink) subframe SF4 is a subframe of a third type. And, a TTG<br>
(transmit transition gap) and an RTG (receive transition gap) are set to 105.714 u.s and 60 u.s,<br>
respectively. According to another numerology, the number of subframes per frame and the<br>
number of symbols within a subframe may be different.<br>
[0012] FIG. 3 is a diagram for an example of a frame structure in FDD system.<br>
[0013] Referring to FIG. 3, a base station supporting FDD system is able to<br>
simultaneously support half-duplex mobile station operating with a same RF carrier and a<br>
full-duplex mobile station both. A mobile station supporting FDD system should use either<br>
H-FDD system or FDD system. All subframes are available for both DL and UL<br>
transmissions. The DL and UL transmissions can be discriminated from each other in<br>
frequency domain. One super frame is divided into 4 frames. And, one of the frames<br>
includes 8 subframes.<br>
[0014] FIG. 4 is a diagram for TDD and FDD frame structures with CP length<br>
corresponding to 1/16 of a useful symbol length (Tu).<br>
[0015] Referring to FIG. 4, a frame of IEEE 802.16m system, which has a CP<br>
length corresponding to 1/16 of a useful symbol length (Tu) for channel bandwidths of<br>
5MHz. 10MHz and 20MHz, includes 5 first type subframes and 3 second type subframes in<br>
FDD system or includes 6 first type subframes and 2 second type subframes in TDD system.<br>
[0016] Assuming that an OFDMA symbol duration is 97.143 us and that a CP<br>
(cyclic prefix) length is set to a length corresponding to 1/16 of a useful symbol length (Tu),<br>
lengths of the first and second type subframes are 0.583 ms and 0.680 ms, respectively. And,<br>
a TTG (transmit transition gap) and an RTG (receive transition gap) are set to 82.853 us and<br>
60 us, respectively. According to another numerology, the number of subframes per frame<br>
and the number of symbols within a subframe may be different.<br>
[0017) As mentioned in the foregoing description, in the IEEE 802.16m system,<br>
OFDMA parameters and frame structures for channel bandwidths of 5MHz, 10MHz and<br>
20MHz are only defined for a case that a CP length is 1/8 Tb and a case that a CP length is<br>
1/16 Tb. Namely, a frame structure for a case that a CP length is 1/4 Tb has not been<br>
proposed so far.<br>
[0018] A frame structure with a CP length of 1/4 Tb may cause a problem with a<br>
previous frame structure with a CP length of 1/8 or 1/16 Tb that interference is generated<br>
from a switching point between downlink and uplink. However, a new frame structure<br>
enabling mutual co-existence by solving this problem has not been proposed so far.<br>
[0019] In the IEEE 802.16m system, OFDMA parameters and frame structures of<br>
1/8 Tb and 1/16 Tb are defined for 8.75 MHz band only but definition has not been made<br>
for 1/4 Tb yet. When a frame structure with a CP length of 1/4 Tb is used, if an idle interval<br>
for TTG/RTG is set in a conventional manner, it may cause a problem that this interval<br>
becomes smaller than TTG/RTG of a frame structure with a different CP length (1/8 Tb or<br>
1/16 Tb). Therefore, this problem needs to be solved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0054] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the<br>
following detailed description of the invention includes details to help the full<br>
understanding of the present invention. Yet, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that the<br>
present invention can be implemented without these details. For instance, although the<br>
following descriptions are made centering on predetermined terminologies, they need not to<br>
be limited to the terminologies. If the following descriptions are made using random<br>
terminologies, the same meanings can be provided. Wherever possible, the same reference<br>
numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
[0055] Throughout this disclosure, if a prescribed part 'includes' a prescribed<br>
element, it means that another element can be further included instead of eliminating other<br>
elements as long as absence of special objection.<br>
[0056] The following descriptions are applicable to various communication systems,<br>
which are capable of providing various communication services of audio data, packet data,<br>
and the like. The technology of the communication system is usable in DL (downlink) or<br>
UL (uplink). In this case, 'base station' can be replaced by such a terminology as a fixed<br>
station, a Node B, an eNode B (eNB), an access point, an ABS and the like. And, 'mobile<br>
station (MS)' can be replaced by such a terminology as a user equipment (UE), a subscriber<br>
station (SS), a mobile subscriber station (MSS), an AMS, a mobile terminal and the like.<br>
[0057] A transmitting end means a node for transmitting data or audio service, and<br>
a receiving end means a node for receiving the data or audio service. Therefore, a mobile<br>
station becomes a transmitting end and a base station becomes a transmitting end, in uplink.<br>
Likewise, a mobile station becomes a receiving end and a base station becomes a receiving<br>
end, in downlink.<br>
[0058] Meanwhile, a mobile station of the present invention can include a PDA<br>
(personal digital assistant), a cellular phone, a PCS (personal communication service) phone,<br>
a GSM (global system for mobile) phone, a WCDMA (wideband CM DA) phone, an MBS<br>
(mobile broadband system) phone or the like.<br>

documents disclosed in at least one of wireless access systems including IEEE 802 system,<br>
3GPP system, 3GPP LTE system and 3GPP2 system. In particular, the steps or parts, which<br>
are not explained to clearly reveal the technical idea of the present invention, in the<br>
embodiments of the present invention can be supported by the above documents. Moreover,<br>
all terminologies disclosed in this document can be supported by at least one of P802.16-<br>
2004, P802.16e-2005, P802.16Rev2 and P802.16m documents which are the standards of<br>
IEEE 802.16 system.<br>
[0060] In the following description, a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Detailed<br>
description disclosed together with the accompanying drawings is intended to explain not a<br>
unique embodiment of the present invention but an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In the following description, specific terminologies used for embodiments of the<br>
present invention are provided to help the understanding of the present invention. And, the<br>
use of the specific terminology can be modified into another form within the scope of the<br>
technical idea of the present invention.<br>
[0061] Basic principles of OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing),<br>
which are multi-carrier modulation scheme in wireless communication systems, are<br>
described as follows.<br>
[0062] First of all, in OFDM system, a high-rate data stream is divided into a<br>
number of slow-rate data streams. This is to simultaneously transmit the data streams using<br>
a plurality of carriers. Each of a plurality of the carriers is called a subcarrier. Since<br>
orthogonality exists among a plurality of carriers in OFDM system, even frequency<br>
components of carriers are mutually overlapped with each other, they can be detected by a<br>
receiving end. A high-rate data stream is converted to a plurality of slow-rate data streams<br>
by a serial to parallel converter. A plurality of the data streams converted in parallel are<br>
multiplied by subcarriers, respectively and are then added together. The added data streams<br>
are transmitted to a receiving end.<br>
[0063] A plurality of the parallel data streams generated by the serial to parallel<br>
converter can be carried on a plurality of subcarriers by IDFT (inverse discrete Fourier<br>
transform). In this case, it is able to efficiently implement the IDFT using IFFT (inverse fast<br>
Fourier transform). As a symbol duration of a slow-rate subcarrier increases, relative time-<br>
domain signal dispersion generated by multi-path delay spreading is reduced.<br>
[0064] In wireless communication using this OFDM system, it is able to insert a<br>
guard interval longer than a delay spreading of channel between symbols in order to reduce<br>
inter-symbol interference. In particular, while each symbol is being transmitted on a multi-<br>
path channel, a guard interval longer than a maximum delay spread of channel is inserted<br>
between contiguous symbols. In doing so, in order to prevent inter-subcarrier orthogonality<br>
breakage, a signal in a last interval (i.e., a guard interval) of a useful symbol interval is<br>
copied and then inserted in a fore part of a symbol. This is called a cyclic prefix (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated CP).<br>
[0065] FIG. 5 is a diagram for an example of a symbol structure including a CP<br>
(cyclic prefix).<br>
[0066] Referring to FIG. 5, a symbol duration Ts becomes a sum of a useful symbol<br>
interval Tb for carrying data actually and a guard interval Tg. A receiving end removes the<br>
guard interval and then performs demodulation by taking data for the useful symbol interval.<br>
A transmitting end and a receiving end may be synchronized with each other using a cyclic<br>
prefix code and the inter-data symbol orthogonality is maintained. In this case, a symbol of<br>
the present invention may be an OFDMA symbol.<br>
[0067] In the following description, explained are frame structures (TDD frame and<br>
FDD frame) in 802.16m system with a CP length (hereinafter named a CP length of 1/4 Tb)<br>
corresponding to 1/4 of a useful symbol length on a channel bandwidth of 8.75 MHz. And,<br>
a TDD frame structure, which can mutually coexist with a TDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/8 or 1/16 Tb for the same channel bandwidth of 8.75 MHz, will be explained.<br>
Moreover, an FDD frame structure with many commonalities with a TDD frame structure<br>
proposed by the present invention is explained as well.<br>
[0068] In IEEE 802.16m system, subframes of 4 kinds of types exist. Theses types<br>
can be defined as follows. First of all, a first type subframe is a subframe including 6<br>
OFDMA symbols. A second type subframe is a subframe including 7 OFDMA symbols. A<br>
third type subframe is a subframe including 5 OFDMA symbols. And, a fourth type<br>
subframe is a subframe including 9 OFDMA symbols. In this case, the fourth type subframe<br>
may be used for a frame structure on 8.75MFIz channel bandwidth.<br>
[0069] As shown in Table 1, OFDMA parametersin case of using a CP length of<br>
1/4 Tb on 8.75MFIz channel bandwidth may be defined, as the same method for a<br>
conventional method for the case of a CP length of 1/8 or 1/16 Tb. In case of with the CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb, a symbol duration of OFDM is 128 us and relative TTG (transmit<br>
transition gap) and RTG (receive transition gap) are 61.6 us and 74.4 us, respectively. In<br>
consideration of the defined OFDMA parameters, in case of using a CP length of 1/4 Tb,<br>
the number of symbols existing within one frame is 39. A frame structure with a CP length<br>
of 1/4 Tb using the first to third type subframes according to the number of symbols used to<br>
define a subframe in a previous frame structure may be constructed. And, the number of<br>
symbols within the frame with the CP length of 1/4 Tb is 39.<br>
[0070] In case that a frame is constructed with 7 subframes in the same manner of<br>
the previous CP length of 1/8 or 1/16 Tb, one OFDMA symbol may be allocated to TTG<br>
and RTG interval in a TDD frame structure. And, the remaining 38 OFDMA symbols may<br>
be allocated to downlink and uplink. In this case, a TDD frame may include 3 first type<br>
subframes and 4 third type subframes.<br>
[0071] FIGs. 6 to 10 are diagrams for examples of a TDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb, which can coexist together with another TDD frame structure with a<br>
different CP length, according to a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of<br>
UL subframes, respectively .<br>
[0072] Referring to FIGs. 6 to 10, a ratio of the number of DL subframesto the<br>
number of UL subframes may be set to (2:5), (3:4), (4:3), (5:2) or (6:1). If the ratios of the<br>
number of DL subframcs to the number of UL subframes is set to (2:5), (3:4), (4:3), (5:2) or<br>
(6:1), respectively, when a communication is performed using a frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb on 8.75MHz channel bandwidth according to the present invention,<br>
interference with a previous frame with a CP length of 1/8 or 1/16 Tb is not generated at a<br>
DL/UL switching point. Therefore, frame structures with different CP lengths can coexist<br>
mutually.<br>
[0073] Since two of 3 first type subframes locate not to be affected by the ratio of<br>
the DL subframe number to the UL subframe number, respectively. They are preferably<br>
located at a first DL subframe and a last UL subframe in one TDD frame, respectively. Yet,<br>
this is just exemplary. The first type subframes are not always located in this manner. A first<br>
DL/UL subframe in TDD frame is configured with a first type subframe including 6<br>
symbols so that the first uplink/downlink subframe start with the first type subframe.<br>
Besides, the remaining first type subframe may be located within a DL or UL subframe in<br>
consideration of the ratio of the DL subframe number to the UL subframe number, the<br>
location of the remaining first type subframe is non-limited.<br>
[0074] Generally, a last DL subframe located in an interval for the switching to UL<br>
from DL includes a subframe constructed with 6 symbols by including an idle interval.<br>
However, in order to generate a time difference (or delay) necessary for TTG interval, the<br>
last DL subframe may be configured with 5 symbols by having one symbol set to an idle<br>
interval. This configuration is always applicable irrespective of the ratio of the DL subframe<br>
number to the UL subframe number. In TDD frame, one symbol may be allocated to an idle<br>
interval of TTG/RTG.<br>
[0075] In case that 2 first type subframes are located in a DL region, one of the 2<br>
first type subframes may be located at a first subframe of a DL frame to use a super frame<br>
header (SFH) constructed with 6 symbols. If the other first type subframe is located at a last<br>
DL sub frame, the last DL subframe is a subframe constructed with 7 symbols by including<br>
an idle interval or the last DL, subframe may be constructed with 6 symbols by allocating<br>
one symbol to an idle interval to generate a time difference necessary for TTG interval. This<br>
configuration is applicable to a case that a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the<br>
number of UL subframes is set to (4:3), (5:2) or (6:1). In this case, for the purpose of<br>
coexistence without interference with a previous frame structure with a different CP length,<br>
2 first type subframes may be located in the DL region (interval). This TDD frame structure<br>
is shown in FIGs. 8 to 10.<br>
[0076] In case that a first type subframe is located at a first subframe of DL<br>
subframes, another first type subframe except the above mentioned subframe may be<br>
randomly located in the DL region.<br>
[0077J In the examples of the above-mentioned frame configurations, if a first type<br>
subframe in a DL interval is located at a first DL subframe of TDD frame and a first type<br>
subframe in a UL interval is a last UL subframe of the TDD frame, or the first type<br>
subframes are located at a first subframe of a DL interval and a first subframe of a UL<br>
interval, respectively, it is able to solve the above-mentioned interference problem that may<br>
be generated from a switching interval from DL to UL.<br>
[0078] If the first type subframes are located at the first DL subframe and the last<br>
UL subframe of the TDD frame or the first type subframes is located at the first DL<br>
subframe and the first UL subframe, as shown in FIGs. 6 to 10, it is just one example for<br>
coexistence with a previous frame structure with a different CP length. In particular, a<br>
subframe configured with 6 symbols may be located at a random subframe in each DL or<br>
UL region. Moreover, even if a first type subframe and a second type subframe are located<br>
at a first DL frame and a second DL frame in a previous frame structure with a CP length of<br>
1/16 Tb, respectively, as shown in one of FIGs. 6 to 10, the TDD frame structure of the<br>
present invention proposed in FIGs. 6 to 10 can mutually coexist with a previous frame<br>
structure with a CP length of 1/8 or 1/16 Tb.<br>
[0079] FIG. 11 is a diagram for an example of an FDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of I /4 Tb.<br>
[0080] FDD frame structure shown in FIG. 11 is a frame structure corresponding to<br>
the TDD frame structure shown in one of FIGs. 6 to 10 and is able to have commonality<br>
with the TDD frame structure. If this frame structure is designed to have commonality with<br>
a TDD frame structure, it is advantageous in reusing the design of channel for essential<br>
control information or additional control information in physical layer design taken into<br>
consideration in designing a system. Therefore, an FDD frame structure is preferably<br>
configured by succeeding to a TDD frame structure. And, 39 symbols may be allocated to<br>
an FDD frame.<br>
[0081] A basic structure of the FDD frame may include 7 subframes in the same<br>
manner of the TDD frame structures shown in FIGs. 6 to 10. And, 39 symbols may be<br>
allocated to this structure. First type subframes are located to first and last subframes of the<br>
FDD frame to maintain commonality. If first type subframes are located at first subframes<br>
of DL and UL regions in the TDD frame structure, respectively, it is able to maintain the<br>
commonality in allocating 6 symbols thereto in the same manner of a previous structure. In<br>
this case, the first type subframe arranged in each region additionally may be located at a<br>
random subframe in the corresponding region without limitation put on its location. In<br>
particular, if a first type subframe is located at a second subframe in FIG. 11, it is just one<br>
example for an FDD frame structure. Thus, limitation is not put on the location of the first<br>
type subframe in the DL/UL region.<br>
[0082] Since the FDD frame structure does not need TTG/RTG of the TDD frame<br>
structure, it is able to further utilize one symbol. Therefore, it is able to consider that a<br>
second type subframe is configured by adding one remaining symbol to a first, a first type<br>
subframe is configured by adding the one remaining symbol to third type subframe. A<br>
iocation of a subframe, to which one symbol can be additionally allocated, may include 3,u'<br>
4th' or 5th subframe in FDD frame in Case 1/2/3/4 shown in FIG. 11. This considers H-FDD<br>
frame structure. In case of considering the H-FDD frame structure, an additional idle<br>
interval is required between groups. For this, it is able to configure such an additional<br>
interval using a first or second type subframe. Yet, this is a considered location for example.<br>
Limitation is not put on a location of the first or second type subframe to which one symbol<br>
is added.<br>
[0083] Alternatively, there is a method of allocating one remaining symbol<br>
individually. Referring to Case 5 shown in FIG. 11, one additional symbol may be allocated<br>
to a first subframe in an FDD frame. Since symbol-unit essential control informations such<br>
as a preamble or a frame control header (FCM) are carried on a head part of a frame, a first<br>
type subframe may be used for data transmission using one symbol after the control<br>
information has been transmitted. Alternatively, referring to Case 8 shown in FIG. 11, one<br>
symbol is allocated to a last subframe of the FDD frame and is used to transmitt additional<br>
information like sounding.<br>
[0084] Moreover, in case of considering H-FDD frame structure, one symbol may<br>
be preferably located in front or rear of a 4n subframe. This is one example for a preferable<br>
location only. And, a location of one added symbol is non-limited by the present invention.<br>
[0085] As mentioned in the foregoing description, in case that one frame is<br>
configured with 7 subframes, 2 first type subframes may be located at 1st and last subframes<br>
in the corresponding frame. And, it is able to consider that one remaining first type<br>
subframe is located at a 2nd subframe or a random subframe in a DL interval.<br>
[0086] FIGs. 12 to 16 arc diagrams for examples of a TDD frame structure with a<br>
CP length of 1/4 Tb, which can coexist together with a frame structure with a different CP<br>
length, according to a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL subframes.<br>
[0087] Referring to FIGs. 12 to 16, a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the<br>
number of UL subframes may be set to one of (2:5), (2:4), (3:4), (3:3), (4:3), (5:2), (4:2).<br>
(6:1) and (5:1). If the ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL subframes<br>
in FIG. 12 is (2:5) or (2:4), a ratio of the total number of symbols allocated to DL subframes<br>
to the total number of symbols allocated to UL subframes is (12:26). If the ratio of the<br>
number of DL subframes to the number of UL subframes in FIG. 13 is (3:4) or (3:3), a ratio<br>
of the total number of symbols allocated to DL subframes to the total number of symbols<br>
allocated to UL subframes is (17:21). If the ratio of the DL subframe number to the UL<br>
subframe number in FIG. 14 is (4:3) or (3:3), a ratio of the total number of corresponding<br>
symbols ailocated to DL subframes to the total number of corresponding symbols allocated<br>
to UL subframes is (22:16) or (21:17). If the ratio of the DL subframe number to the UL<br>
subframe number in FIG. 15 is (5:2) or (4:2), a ratio of the total number of corresponding<br>
symbols allocated to DL subframes to the total number of corresponding symbols allocated<br>
to UL subframes is (27:11) or (26:12). If the ratio of the DL subframe number to the UL<br>
subframe number in FIG. 16 is (6:1), a ratio of the total number of symbols allocated to DL<br>
subframes to the total number of symbols allocated to UL subframes is (32:6). If the ratio of<br>
the DL subframe number to the UL subframe number in FIG. 16 is (5:1), a ratio of the total<br>
number of symbols allocated to DL subframes to the total number of symbols allocated to<br>
UL subframes is (31:7) or (32:6).<br>
[0088] In order to coexist without interference with a frame structure with a<br>
previously defined CP length of 1/16 Tb, it is necessary for DL/UL switching points not to<br>
be overlapped with each other. For this, it is able to consider that a frame structure with a<br>
CP length of 1/4 Tb is configured with 6 subframes. In TDD frame, one symbol may be<br>
allocated for TTG/RTG interval. And, it is able to configure a TDD frame constructed with<br>
6 subframes using 38 remaining symbols like the two following cases.<br>
[0089] In the first case, a TDD frame may be constructed with 4 second type<br>
subframes and 2 third type subframes. In the second case, a TDD frame may be constructed<br>
with 4 first type subframes and 2 second type subframes.<br>
[0090J In consideration of an idle interval, a first or second type subframe may be<br>
located at a last DL frame that is a switching interval from DL to UL in a TDD frame<br>
structure. If the second type subframe is located at the last DL subframe, a new type<br>
subframe constructed with 8 symbols by including the idle interval is generated. This<br>
deviates from a scope of a previously defined subframe. Therefore, the new type subframe<br>
needs to be defined.<br>
[0091] In case that the second type subframe is allocated to the last DL subframe<br>
located in the interval for switching to UL from DL in consideration of the idle interval, one<br>
symbol may be set to the idle interval for a delay necessary for a TTG interval. Hence, the<br>
first type subframe constructed with 6 symbols may be located at the last DL subframe. In<br>
this case, first type subframes may be located at first and last subframes of a frame in a DL<br>
region. This configuration is applicable irrespective of a ratio of the number of DL<br>
subframes to the number of UL subframes.<br>
[0092] In order to coexist without interference with a previously defined frame<br>
structure with a CP length of 1/16 Tb, if one frame is configured using 6 subframes like the<br>
first case, a third type subframe may be located at a last DL subframe in consideration of a<br>
switching interval from DL to UL irrespective of the ratio of the DL subframe number to<br>
the UL subframe number. Moreover, referring to FIG. 14, if the ratio of the DL subframe<br>
number to the UL subframe number is (3:3), a new type subframe constructed with 8<br>
symbols may be located at a last DL subframe.<br>
[00931 In the second case for constructing a frame with first and second type<br>
subframes, if the first type subframes are located at first subframes in DL and UL regions,<br>
respectively, the first or second type subframe may be located at a last DL subframe that is a<br>
switching interval from DL to UL. In this case, in consideration of 1 symbol allocated for an<br>
idle time of the switching interval, a subframe constructed with 7 or 8 symbols may be<br>
located at a last DL subframe. In this case, in order to coexist without interference with a<br>
previously defined frame structure with a CP length of 1/16 Tb, 2 second type subframes<br>
constructing a TDD frame may be located in the DL and UL regions, respectively.<br>
Corresponding examples are shown in FIG. 12, FIG. 15 and FIG. 16. In this case, the<br>
locations of the first and second type subframes are just exemplary. And, the locations of<br>
the subframes of the above types are non-limited in the DL and UL regions.<br>
[0094] FIGs. 12 to 16 show a frame structure to coexist without interference with a<br>
previously defined frame structure with a CP length of 1/16 Tb using 7 subframes. In FIGs.<br>
12 to 16, if one frame is constructed with 6 subframes, second type subframes are arranged<br>
at first and last subframes in a frame or DL and UL intervals, respectively. This is just<br>
exemplary only. A subframe constructed with 7symbols may be located at a random<br>
subframe in each DL/UL region.<br>
[0095] FIG. 17 is a diagram for an example of an FDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb.<br>
[0096] First of all, an FDD frame structure shown in FIG. 17 is a frame structure<br>
corresponding to the TDD frame structure shown in FIGs. 12 to 16. A frame structure for<br>
FDD is preferably configured by succeeding to a TDD structure. By applying the above-<br>
described FDD frame structure per Case, it is able to appropriately configure an FDD frame.<br>
Therefore, like the TDD frame structures shown in FIGs. 12 to 16, one frame consists of 7<br>
subframes in this frame structure. And, an FDD structure for a case that a first type<br>
subframe is iocated at a second subframe of a frame can consider a frame structure like one<br>
of FDD-Cases 4 to 9 shown in FIG. 11.<br>
[0097] In case that an FDD frame is constructed with 6 subframes, one frame<br>
consists of 6 subframes like a previous TDD frame structure, as shown in FIGs. 12 to 16.<br>
And, second type subframes are located at first and last subframes and second and fifth<br>
subframes of the frame, respectively to maintain a symmetric structure.<br>
[0098] Meanwhile, 39 symbols may be allocated to the FDD frame shown in FIG.<br>
17. Since TTG/RTG is not required for the FDD frame structure unlike the TDD frame<br>
structure, one symbol may be used in addition. Therefore, it is able to consider configuring<br>
a first type subframe in a manner of adding a remaining symbol to a third type subframe.<br>
The subframe including added one symbol thereto may be located at 3rd or 4th subframe in<br>
the frame of Cases 1 to 4 shown in FIG. 17.<br>
[0099] Yet, this considers FI-FDD frame structure. In case of considering H-FDD<br>
structure, an inter-group idle interval is additionally necessary. For this, the additional inter-<br>
group idle interval is configured using a first or second type subframe. Moreover, a location<br>
of the first or second type subframe having one symbol added thereto is non-limited by the<br>
present invention.<br>
[00100] As another method of allocating one additional symbol, there is an<br>
individual allocation method. A location of this symbol is shown in Cases 1 to 4 of FIG. 17<br>
described in consideration of H-FDD. In this case, this symbol is preferably located<br>
between 3rd and 4th subframes. This location is a preferable location only. The location of<br>
the added symbol is non-limited by the present invention. Therefore, as mentioned in the<br>
foregoing description of the FDD frame structure, one symbol may be allocated to a first or<br>
last subframe in a frame individually.<br>
[00101| FIG. 18 is a diagram for an example of a TDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb.<br>
[00102] Referring to FIG. 18, in case that one TDD frame consists of 6 subframes, it<br>
is able to construct a frame by allocating first type subframes, each of which includes 6<br>
symbols, more. In this case, one TDD frame may consist of 4 first type subframes and 2<br>
second type subframes. Since it is preferable that the 2 second type subframes are located at<br>
positions not to be affected by a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL<br>
subframes, the 2 second type subframes may be located at a first DL subframe and a last UL<br>
subframe in one frame, respectively. Thus, the second type subframes are located at the first<br>
DL subframe and the last UL subframe, respectively. This is just exemplary and the location<br>
of the second type subframe is non-limited.<br>
[00103] When the number of DL subframes is at least 2, in case of considering a<br>
ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL subframes, the second type<br>
subframe may be located at a 2" subframe in a frame. As mentioned in the foregoing<br>
description, it is able to configure a frame in a manner of arranging first type subframes at<br>
1st subframes in DL and UL regions, respectively. Thus, as the first type subframe having 6<br>
symbols is located at the 1st subframe in the frame, it is able to successively use the previous<br>
super frame header structure defined as 6 symbols without amending a subframe structure.<br>
[00104] Although the last DL subframe located at the switching interval from DL to<br>
UL is the subframe constructed with 7 symbols by including the idle interval, it is generally<br>
able to construct a subframe with 6 symbols by allocating one symbol to an idle interval to<br>
generate a time difference necessary for TTG interval. This configuration is applicable<br>
irrespective of the ratio of the DL subframe number to the UL subframe number.<br>
[00105| In FIG. 18, shown arc a frame structure, in which second type subframes are<br>
located at first and last subframes in a frame, respectively and a frame structure, in which<br>
first type subframes are iocated at first subframes of DL and UL regions, respectively. The<br>
frame structure shown in FIG. 18 is just exemplary. And, locations of the first and second<br>
type subframes for configuring one frame are non-limited.<br>
[00106] FIG. 19 is a diagram for an example of an FDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb.<br>
[00107] First of all, an FDD frame structure shown in FIG. 19 corresponds to a<br>
frame structure corresponding to the TDD frame structure shown in FIG. 18. Preferably, the<br>
FDD frame structure is configured by succeeding to the TDD frame structure. By applying<br>
the FDD frame structure per Case proposed in the foregoing description, a proper FDD<br>
frame structure can be taken into consideration. A second type subframe, as shown in FIG.<br>
18, may be located at a first, second or last subframe in a frame. And, first type subframes<br>
may be arranged at first subframes of DL and UL regions, respectively.<br>
[00108] In this case, as the FDD frame structure does not need a TTG/RTG interval<br>
unlike the TDD frame structure, one symbol may be additionally utilized. Therefore, it is<br>
able to consider configuring a second type subframe by adding a remaining symbol to a first<br>
type subframe. The subframe having the added symbol located thereat can be located at a<br>
3r or 4* subframe in a frame, as shown in Case 1 or Case 2 of FIG. 19. This considers H-<br>
FDD frame structure. In case of considering H-FDD frame structure, an additional idle<br>
interval between groups is necessary. For this, it is able to additionally configure a<br>
necessary interval using a second type subframe. Yet, this is just am example of considered<br>
location. And, a location of a second type subframe, to which one symbols is added, is non-<br>
limited by the present invention.<br>
[00109] As another method of allocating one additional symbol, there is a method of<br>
arranging one remaining symbol individually. If a symbol is added in front of a Ist subframe<br>
in a frame, as shown in Case 3 of FIG. 19, it is to transmit such control information carried<br>
on a head part of a frame as essential control informations of symbol unit such as a<br>
preamble or a frame control header (SFH).<br>
[00110] Besides, unlike the above description, it is able to use one symbol to carry<br>
such additional information as sounding in a manner of allocating a symbol in rear of a last<br>
subframe in a frame, as shown in Case 5. Preferably, in consideration of the H-FDD frame<br>
structure, one symbol is located between a 3rd subframe and a 4th subframe. This is an<br>
example of a preferred location only. And, a location of an added symbol is non-limited by<br>
the present invention.<br>
[00111] Moreover, as mentioned in the foregoing description, a second type<br>
subframe located at a 1st subframe in a frame may be located at a 2" subframe in the frame.<br>
And, a first type subframe may be located at the 1st subframe in the frame. In this case, the<br>
second type subframe located at the 1st subframe in the frame can be represented as a<br>
structure that the second type subframe is located at a 2n subframe in an FDD frame<br>
structure, as shown in FIG. 19. In a manner that a first type subframe including 6 symbols is<br>
located at a 1st subframe in a frame, it is able to use a previously defined super frame header<br>
structure constructed with 6 symbols without modification.<br>
[00112] Thus, a signal is transmitted/received using a TDD frame structure for 8.75<br>
MHz channel bandwidth with a CP length of 1/4 Tb according to the present invention and<br>
an FDD structure having commonality with the TDD frame structure. Therefore, mutual<br>
coexistence with a previously defined frame with a different CP length is possible.<br>
[00113] In the following description, TDD frame structure for 8.75 MHz channel<br>
bandwidth with a CP length of 1/4 Tb in IFZEE 802.16m system and an FDD frame structure<br>
having commonality with the TDD frame structure are explained.<br>
[00114] A TDD frame structure for 8.75 MHz channel bandwidth with a CP length<br>
of 1/4 Tb according to the present invention and an FDD frame structure have commonality<br>
with a previously defined frame with a different CP length. In order to coexist together with<br>
the previously defined frame with a different CP length, this frame structure does not cause<br>
interference in a manner that switching points from DL to UL are not overlapped with each<br>
other in TDD frame. In case of using a CP length of 1/4 Tb on 8.75 MHz, as shown in Table<br>
1, OFDMA parameters can be defined by the method for a previous case of CP length of 1/8<br>
Tb or 1/16 Tb. If a CP length is set to 1/4 Tb, a symbol duration of OFDM is 128 us and the<br>
number of OFDMA symbols existing in one frame is 39.<br>
[00115] It is able to construct a frame structure with a CP length of 1/4 Tb using first<br>
to third type subframes according to the number of symbols used to define a subframe in a<br>
previous frame structure. In a TDD frame structure, one symbol may be allocated as a<br>
TTG/RTG interval. In case that DL and UL regions are allocated with 38 remaining<br>
symbols, relative TTG and RTG are set to 61.6 u,s and 74.4 us, respectively. This is a value<br>
smaller than that of TTG/RTG in a previous frame structure with a CP length of 1/8 or 1/16<br>
Tb shown in Table 1. Therefore, if a switching to UL from DL is performed, a problem may<br>
be caused.<br>
[00116] Yet, according to the present invention, in order to generate an interval<br>
similar to TTG/RTG of a previously defined frame with a different CP length in a frame, it<br>
is able to construct a frame with 37 symbols remaining after 2 symbols have been allocated<br>
as TTG and RTG intervals in a TDD frame structure.<br>
[00117] FIG. 20 is a diagram for an example of a TDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb.<br>
[00118] Referring to FIG. 20, a TDD frame may be constructed with 6 subframes in<br>
order to use a first type subframe of a previous subframe type, which includes 6 symbols, as<br>
many as possible. And. one frame consists of 5 first type subframes and one second type<br>
subframe. In particular, when a frame is constructed by allocating 38 symbols, a second<br>
type subframe may be changed into a first type subframe by allocating one symbol to one of<br>
the 2 second type subframes for TTG/RTG. As a corresponding result, it is able to configure<br>
a frame structure, of which number of second type subframes is decremented by 1 smaller<br>
than that of a previous case of allocating one symbol. In particular, in a TDD frame<br>
structure, one symbol may be allocated as an idle interval for TTG/RTG.<br>
[00119] In FIG. 20, if a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL<br>
subframes is (5:1), (4:2), (3:3), or(2:4), a ratio of the total number of symbols allocated to<br>
corresponding DL subframes to the total number of symbols allocated to UL subframes can<br>
become (31:6), (25:12), (19:18), or( 13:24), respectively.<br>
[00120] One second type subframe existing in a TDD frame may be located in DL or<br>
UL region. In this case, since a previously defined first type subframe is preferably located<br>
at a first subframe of a frame to transmit a preamble and a super frame header (SFH) in case<br>
of DL, second type subframes are preferably located in a manner of starting with a second<br>
subframe in the frame. Therefore, as the first type subframe having 6 symbols is located at<br>
the first subframe in the frame, it is able to use a super frame header structure previously<br>
defined with 6 symbols without modifying a subframe structure by succeeding to the<br>
corresponding super frame header structure. This frame configuration is just exemplary.<br>
And, the second type subframe can be located at a random subframe in the frame.<br>
[00121] Although a last DL subframc located in a switching interval to UL from DL<br>
is a subframe constructed with 7 symbols by including an idle interval, it can be constructed<br>
with 6 symbols by allocating one symbol to an idle interval to generate a time difference<br>
necessary as a TTG interval in general.<br>
[00122] Yet, in case that a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL<br>
subframes is (2:4). a second type subframe may be located at the last DL subframe. In this<br>
case, the last subframe is constructed with 7 symbols. In configurations except this case, a<br>
last frame can be constructed with 6 symbols irrespective of the ratio of the DL subframe<br>
number to the UL subframe number. A frame can be configured in a manner of further<br>
allocating one symbol of another second type subframe for TTG to generate a first type<br>
subframe. FIG. 20 shows a frame structure in which a second type subframe is located at a<br>
second subframe in a frame.<br>
[00123] FIG. 21 is a diagram for an example of a TDD frame structure and a<br>
corresponding FDD frame structure in case that a ratio of the number of DL subframes to<br>
the number of UL subframes is 4:2 in the TDD frame structure shown in FIG. 20.<br>
[00124] Referring to FIG. 21, since it is unnecessary to set an additional idle interval<br>
for TTG/RTG in an FDD frame structure, it is able to configure a frame using 39 OFDMA<br>
symbols. In case that an FDD frame is constructed with 6 subframes like a TDD frame, it<br>
can be constructed with 3 first type subframes and 3 second type subframes. In this case, in<br>
order to transmit a super frame header constructed with 6 symbols, a first type subframe is<br>
preferably located at a first subframe of a frame.<br>
[00125] It is able to transmit such additional information as sounding in a manner of<br>
allocating one additional symbol in rear of a 3rd or 4th subframe independently in<br>
consideration of an H-FDD frame structure or a mid-amble within the frame or arranging<br>
one symbol in rear of a last subframe of the frame. Thus, it is able to transmit a signal<br>
without modifying a previous subframe structure for data transmission.<br>
[00126] FIG. 22 is a diagram for an example of a TDD frame structure with a CP<br>
length of 1/4 Tb.<br>
[00127] First of all, a TDD frame structure shown in FIG. 22 is configured in a<br>
manner that the second type subframe located in the DL interval of the former TDD frame<br>
structure shown in FIG. 20 is located in a UL. In this case, a location of the second type<br>
subframe in the UL is non-limited. In this case shown in FIG. 22, 2 symbols are allocated as<br>
TTG/RTG interval for the switching from DL to UL like the case shown in FIG. 20. In this<br>
case, although a last DL subframe is a subframe constructed with 7 symbols, it can be<br>
constructed with 6 symbols by allocating one symbol to an idle interval to generate a time<br>
difference generally necessary for a TTG interval. This configuration is applicable<br>
irrespective of a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL subframes.<br>
Another frame can be configured in a manner of constructing a first type subframe<br>
including 6 symbols by allocating one symbol of another second type subframe existing in a<br>
frame to an idle interval. Therefore, all DL subframes can include first type subframes. And,<br>
a second type subframe is arranged at a first UL subframe to use for discrimination between<br>
DL and UL.<br>
[00128] In the TDD frame structure shown in FIG. 22, if a ratio of the number of DL<br>
subframes to the number of UL subframes is (5:1), (4:2), (3:3), or(2:4), a ratio of the total<br>
number of symbols allocated to corresponding DL subframes to the total number of<br>
symbols allocated to corresponding UL subframes can be set to (30:7), (24:13), (18:19), or<br>
(12:25).<br>
[00129] FIG. 23 is a diagram for an example of" a TDD frame structure and a<br>
corresponding FDD frame structure in case that a ratio of the number of DL subframes to<br>
the number of UL subframes is 4:2 in the TDD frame structure shown in FIG. 20.<br>
[00130] Referring to FIG. 23, a TDD frame structure for the specific ratio of TDD<br>
shown in FIG. 22 and an FDD frame structure are illustrated. In the TDD frame structure<br>
shown in FIG. 23, a second type subframe is allowed to exist in an UL region only. In<br>
particular, the second type subframe may be located at a 1st one of UL subframes. In this<br>
case, it is able to discriminate UL and DL from each other using the second type subframe.<br>
Moreover, no limitation is put on a location of the second type subframe in UL.<br>
[00131] In the above frame configurations described with reference to FIGs. 20 to 23,<br>
for a case that a ratio of the number of DL subframes to the number of UL subframes is<br>
(6:0), it is not necessary for a TDD frame to separately set an idle interval for DL/UL<br>
switching like the FDD frame. In this case, the TDD frame structure has the same<br>
configuration of the FDD frame structure. And, a first type subframe may be located at a 1st<br>
subframe in a frame to transmit a super frame header constructed with 6 symbols. If so, it is<br>
able to use a super frame structure, which is defined using 6 symbols, and a control channel<br>
structure in succession without designing a new subframe structure.<br>
[00132] Accordingly, if a frame structure with a CP length of 1/4 Tb according to the<br>
present invention is designed, it is able to solve the problem that a previous TTG/RTG<br>
interval may become smaller than a TTG/RTG interval set in a frame structure with a<br>
different CP length (e.g., a CP length of 1/8 Tb, a CP length of 1/16 Tb, etc.).<br>
[00133] FIG. 24 is a block diagram showing constitutional elements of a device 50,<br>
that may be either the MS or the BS, and that can perform the methods of FIGs 6 to 23.<br>

[00134] Layers of a radio interface protocol between the UE and the network can be<br>
classified into a first layer (LI), a second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the<br>
lower three iayers of the open system interconnection (OS1) model that is weil-known in the<br>
communication system. A physical layer, or simply a PHY layer, belongs to the first layer<br>
and provides an information transfer service through a physical channel. A radio resource<br>
control (RRC) layer belongs to the third layer and serves to control radio resources between<br>
the UE and the network. The UE and the network exchange RRC messages via the RRC<br>
layer.<br>
