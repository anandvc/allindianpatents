Tool for connecting cable cores<br>
The invention relates to a tool for connecting cable cores, in particular of<br>
insulated telecommunication and data cables, to an insulation-piercing contact<br>
element.<br>
EP 0040307 B1 discloses a tool for connecting insulated electrical conductor<br>
wires. This tool comprises a hollow two-shell grip, in which a striking mechanism<br>
with a spring-loaded hollow slider and a ram which can be longitudinally<br>
displaced against spring force are arranged. Arranged on the part of the ram<br>
protruding out of the front end of the grip, on the head of the ram, is a wire<br>
cutter comprising two scissor legs, one of the scissor legs being pivotably<br>
movable and having at the rear end, located in the interior of the grip, an<br>
inclined longitudinal slot, in which a pin fastened in the grip is guided. A<br>
longitudinal displacement of the ram consequently leads to a pivoting movement<br>
of the movable scissor leg. For connecting an insulated cable core into an<br>
insulation-piercing contact arranged in a terminal strip, the ram head is first<br>
placed on the terminal strip. Then the grip is manually pressed in the direction<br>
of the terminal strip, until the cable core is pressed into the contact slot of the<br>
insulation-piercing contact. The advancing force exerted on the grip brings about<br>
a relative movement between the ram and the grip and also between the scissor<br>
leg of the wire cutter and the pin fastened to the grip, which then slides into the<br>
inclined longitudinal slot and thereby pivots the movable scissor leg in such a<br>
way that the cutting edge formed on its front end cuts off the cable core.<br>
EP 0329917 Bl also discloses a tool for connecting cable cores to insulation-<br>
piercing contacts, with a ram which is longitudinally displaceable in the tool<br>
housing and with a cutter for the cable cores, which is arranged on the ram<br>
head, the longitudinal displacement of the ram serving for triggering the cutter.<br>
Also arranged on the ram is a latching lock, which blocks the longitudinal<br>
displacement of the ram with respect to the housing, and arranged on the ram<br>
head is a sensor, which is connected to the latching lock and only releases the<br>
longitudinal displacement of the ram in the tool housing, and consequently the<br>
cutting-off operation, when there is actuation by the insulation-piercing contact<br>
or a component surrounding it.<br><br><br>
A disadvantage of the tools known from the prior art is that satisfactory handling<br>
of the respective tool by the installation engineer is either not possible or else<br>
significantly restricted in the case of confined space conditions during the<br>
installation operation. In particular when organizing generally bifilar<br>
telecommunication and data lines on an already occupied terminal strip,<br>
difficulties frequently occur if - as is generally usual - the already occupied<br>
insulation-piercing contact elements of a terminal strip are provided with safety<br>
connectors, in order to ensure overvoltage protection, for example against<br>
lightning strikes. As a result, the space conditions at an insulation-piercing<br>
contact element to be newly occupied are restricted by the spatial extent of the<br>
surrounding safety connectors alone, which has the effect on the one hand that<br>
the line to be organized can no longer be positioned correctly at the contact slot<br>
of the insulation-piercing contact element before the actual connecting and<br>
pressing-in operation and on the other hand that the connecting tool required for<br>
the installation can no longer be brought close enough to the insulation-piercing<br>
contact element that is to be newly occupied to press the line in and cut it off.<br>
The only solution remaining for the installation engineer is often to pull off all<br>
those surrounding safety connectors that are hindering the installation operation,<br>
to make it possible in the first place for the line that is to be organized to be<br>
connected. However, on the one hand this means additional work for the<br>
installation engineer and on the other hand also does not correspond to the<br>
desirable procedure from safety aspects. Moreover, re-fitting of the safety<br>
connectors may be forgotten. Optimizing a tool for connecting cable cores to an<br>
insulation-piercing contact element when there are reduced space conditions on<br>
the terminal strip consequently represents a problem which has so far not been<br>
solved satisfactorily by the customary methods and devices that are known from<br>
the prior art.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the technical problem of providing an<br>
improved tool for connecting cable cores to an insulation-piercing contact<br>
element.<br><br><br>
The solution to the technical problem is provided according to the invention by<br>
the subject matter of claims 1 and 22. Further advantageous refinements of the<br>
invention are provided by the subclaims.<br>
The invention is based here on the recognition that on the one hand<br>
simultaneous connection of two cable cores of a bifilar line to two insulation-<br>
piercing contact elements lying next to each other in a single working step offers<br>
the possibility of better utilizing the installation space that is available, and<br>
consequently being able to dispense with pulling out the surrounding safety<br>
connectors, if a specially configured tool is used. On the other hand, temporary<br>
fixing of the cable cores to be connected to the ram head of the tool before the<br>
actual connecting and pressing-in operation facilitates the reliable pre-positioning<br>
of the cable cores. This is achieved according to the invention by proposing a<br>
connecting tool in which the ram head is shaped in such a way that at least two<br>
cable cores can be connected and pressed in at at least two insulation-piercing<br>
contact elements lying next to each other. This also allows quick, positionally<br>
accurate and reliable connecting of cable cores even when there are very<br>
confined space conditions on the terminal strip, which are caused for example by<br>
safety connectors attached to the surrounding insulation-piercing contact<br>
elements, without having to pull further safety connectors out of the terminal<br>
strip for installation purposes apart from the safety connector provided for the<br>
double core that is to be installed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ram protrudes through an opening in an end<br>
face of a tool housing, in which the ram is arranged in a longitudinally<br>
displaceable manner. Arranged on the ram head is a cutter for the cable cores,<br>
the longitudinal displacement of the ram serving for triggering the cutting-off<br>
operation. As a result, connecting, pressing-in and cutting-off take place in one<br>
operation, the defined cutting-off of the cable cores allowing the transmission<br>
properties at the contacts to be reproduced in terms of quality.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the part of the ram protruding from the tool<br>
comprises a ram head and a ram shank. In this case, the ram head primarily<br>
serves for attaching the subcomponents of the tool that are required for the<br>
connecting, pressing-in and cutting-off of the cable cores and are in direct<br><br><br>
engagement with the insulation-piercing contact element during the installation<br>
operation. The function of the ram shank, on the other hand, is mainly based on<br>
the. idea of producing an operative connection between the mechanical<br>
subcomponents accommodated in the tool housing and the subcomponents<br>
attached to the ram head and also of increasing the range of the tool by its<br>
length. The ram head preferably differs here from the ram shank by a greater<br>
extent in the circumferential direction. In the case of those embodiments in<br>
which the cutter is formed by two scissor blades which are movable with respect<br>
to each other and are pivotally mounted with respect to each other about a<br>
common axis, the ram is divided into the ram head and the ram shank precisely<br>
by that vertical plane which runs perpendicularly in relation to the longitudinal<br>
direction of the tool and includes the pivot axis of the cutter.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the cutter arranged on the ram head<br>
comprises two scissor blades which are movable with respect to each other, one<br>
of the two scissor blades having at least one shearing surface and the other<br>
scissor blade having at least two shearing surfaces. In this case, the at least two<br>
shearing surfaces located on one scissor blade are provided for the purpose of<br>
respectively shearing off simultaneously and separately from one another one of<br>
the cable cores that are to be connected to an insulation-piercing contact<br>
element and cut off.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, at least one of the shearing surfaces is<br>
part of a u-shaped indentation of one of the scissor blades. This u-shaped<br>
indentation serves the purpose of enclosing the cable cores that are to be cut<br>
and avoiding slipping away or escaping of the cable core during the cutting-off<br>
operation.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, at least one of the shearing surfaces has a<br>
beveled cutting-edge geometry. Such a shearing surface, configured for<br>
example in the form of a beveled edge (chamfer), offers the advantage of an<br>
optimum shearing action in combination with the opposite shearing blade during<br>
the cutting-off of the cable core.<br><br><br>
In a further embodiment, the scissor blades are arranged lying flat on the ram,<br>
one over the other, an inner scissor blade being arranged between the ram and<br>
an outer scissor blade and the outer scissor blade not being in contact, by at<br>
least one of its outer surfaces, either with the ram head and/or ram shank or<br>
with the other scissor blade. An embodiment of this type, in which the cutter is<br>
attached to a certain extent such that it lies freely on the ram and the outer<br>
scissor blade is not restricted by the geometry of the ram, makes particularly<br>
simple assembly of the tool possible and similarly, if need be, uncomplicated<br>
exchange of one of the scissor blades.<br>
In a further embodiment, the outer scissor blade has a u-shaped indentation and<br>
two shearing surfaces with beveled cutting-edge geometry, the one shearing<br>
surface being part of the u-shaped indentation and the other shearing surface<br>
being formed by part of the narrow outer surface of the scissor blade running in<br>
the longitudinal direction. In this case, the u-shaped indentation serves the<br>
purpose of enclosing one of the cable cores that is to be cut and avoiding slipping<br>
away or escaping of the cable core during the cutting-off operation, while the<br>
beveled cutting-edge geometry, for example in the form of a beveled edge<br>
(chamfer), ensures an optimum shearing action in combination with the opposite<br>
shearing blade during the cutting-off of the cable cores.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the inner scissor blade has two u-shaped<br>
indentations and two shearing surfaces, the two shearing surfaces respectively<br>
being part of one of the two u-shaped indentations. In this case, the distances<br>
between the u-shaped indentations preferably correspond to the spacing pitch of<br>
the insulation-piercing contact elements in the terminal strip to which the cable<br>
cores are to be connected. The u-shaped indentations, and in particular the two<br>
shearing surfaces, in this case respectively form a complementary cutting edge<br>
with respect to the shearing surface of the outer scissor blade and in this way<br>
permit secure enclosing of the cable cores that are to be cut and an optimum<br>
shearing action. In this case, the cutting-edge regions of the inner scissor blade<br>
preferably correspond to the opposite cutting-edge regions of the outer scissor<br>
blade and preferably cover one another completely, or at least partly, in the<br>
course of their shearing movement with respect to each other.<br><br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the outer scissor blade is movable and<br>
pivotable with respect to the inner scissor blade. In this case, the inner scissor<br>
blade is fixed, while the outer scissor blade can perform a pivoting movement<br>
with respect to the inner scissor blade, it preferably being possible for the<br>
pivoting movement to be triggered by means of an inclined groove with the aid<br>
of a spring-loaded slider in the tool housing. This embodiment allows a<br>
particularly simple, low-cost, stable and low-maintenance construction of the<br>
connecting tool.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the scissor blades are mounted pivotably<br>
with respect to each other about a common axis. On account of the lever action<br>
produced during the shearing operation, depending on the arrangement of the<br>
pivot point, this allows a particularly favorable ratio of forces between the<br>
manual force applied by the installation engineer and the shearing forces acting,<br>
which can in this way be made to suit exactly the thickness of the wire to be cut<br>
off with the tool.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the common axis is formed by a connecting<br>
element which connects the two scissor blades pivotably to each other and to the<br>
ram. As a result, a particularly simple and stable construction of the tool is<br>
ensured.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the connecting element is formed as a screw.<br>
This allows a particularly simple and stable construction of the tool and, if need<br>
be, uncomplicated exchange of the scissor blades. In principle, apart from this<br>
preferred configuration, however, other fastening means are also conceivable as<br>
the connecting element, such as rivets for example.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the ram shank is at least just as long as the<br>
ram head. A ram shank which is of the same length as the ram head or longer in<br>
this case serves the purpose of increasing the range of the tool. In particular<br>
when bifilar lines are being connected simultaneously to two insulation-piercing<br>
contact elements lying next to each other of a terminal strip, there are<br>
particularly confined space conditions on the terminal strip if the neighboring<br>
insulation-piercing contact elements are all fitted with safety connectors. In this<br><br><br>
case, an extension of the ram shank can be deliberately used to increase the<br>
distance between the safety connector and the tool housing in particular, which<br>
otherwise often proves to be a problem during the installation operation. This<br>
has the consequence that, even if the intermediate space between two<br>
surrounding safety connectors is just narrow enough to allow the ram of the tool<br>
to pass through, satisfactory connecting and pressing-in of the cable cores in the<br>
terminal strip is nevertheless possible with the aid of the connecting tool and<br>
there is no collision between the tool housing and safety connectors during the<br>
installation operation.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a latching lock which blocks the longitudinal<br>
displacement of the ram with respect to the tool housing is arranged on the ram,<br>
and a sensor which is connected to the latching lock and releases the latching<br>
lock when there is actuation by a terminal strip which comprises the insulation-<br>
piercing contact elements is arranged on the ram head. In this case, the sensor<br>
which is arranged on the ram head and is connected to the latching lock only<br>
releases the longitudinal displacement when the cable core that is to be<br>
connected has fully reached the end position in the contact slot of the insulation-<br>
piercing contact element and a satisfactory connection has been established.<br>
This ensures that the end of the cable core is only cut off after contacting has<br>
taken place. It is in this case also conceivable that the latching lock can be<br>
manually unlocked independently of the sensor by means of an unlocking device,<br>
for example for the case in which two cable cores are to be connected into the<br>
same contact slot of an insulation-piercing contact element.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the sensor acts via a sensor rod on a spring-<br>
loaded pawl of the latching lock. This corresponds to a particularly simple, stable<br>
and maintenance-free type of construction of the tool. In this case, when a<br>
reference point, which may be formed for example by part of the terminal strip,<br>
is reached, a mechanically acting sensor exerts a force via a sensor rod on the<br>
spring-loaded pawl of the latching lock, in this way signals the correct pressing-in<br>
depth of the cable cores into the contact slot of the insulation-piercing contact<br>
element and only then releases the cutting movement for cutting off the ends of<br>
the cable cores.<br><br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the sensor rod runs at least partly in the ram<br>
head in a vertical plane running centrally through the tool and at least partly in<br>
the ram shank in a plane parallel to the vertical plane running centrally through<br>
the tool. This arrangement is of advantage in particular in the case of<br>
embodiments with scissor blades which are mounted pivotably about an axis with<br>
respect to each other, if the sensor is attached centrally in the ram head and the<br>
force is then likewise passed on substantially centrally in the longitudinal<br>
direction from the sensor via the sensor rod in the ram head. In order to avoid<br>
space problems within the ram in the case of this configuration, the sensor rod is<br>
then preferably angled away a number of times and is continued within the ram<br>
shank slightly offset laterally with respect to the vertical central plane of the tool,<br>
so that no conflict occurs with the arrangement of the pivot axis of the scissor<br>
blades, or the corresponding connecting element.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, at least two pressing-in plates are arranged<br>
parallel to each other in the ram head. These plates may be produced for<br>
example from metal and offer the advantage of particularly high stability, so that<br>
satisfactory functioning of the tool is always ensured even when there are great<br>
pressing-in forces and the tool is used frequently. Although the pressing-in<br>
plates are preferably configured as components which are separately attached in<br>
the ram head, it is also conceivable that the pressing-in plates can be formed<br>
from a single part together with the ram head.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the end face of the ram head is provided with<br>
a longitudinally slit clamping element for receiving at least two cable cores. This<br>
allows the cable cores to be temporarily fixed to the ram head before the actual<br>
connecting and pressing-in operation, whereby particularly safe handling and<br>
more accurate pre-positioning of the cable cores at the contact slot of the<br>
insulation-piercing contact element is made possible, in particular when there are<br>
confined space conditions on the terminal strip. In this case, the means for<br>
fixing the cable cores in the clamping element are preferably configured as<br>
parallel slots, which are made slightly wider than the diameter of the cable cores<br>
to be connected. In order to ensure the fixing of the cable cores, detents are in<br>
this case preferably attached to the slot openings, which are open toward the<br>
end face of the clamping element and allow the cable cores to latch in the<br><br><br>
clamping element before the actual connecting and pressing-in operation at the<br>
contact slot of the insulation-piercing contact element. The opening left free by<br>
the detents on the end face of the clamping element is in this case just large<br>
enough that, after connecting, pressing-in and cutting-off of the cable cores has<br>
taken place in the terminal strip, the clamping forces of the insulation-piercing<br>
contact element acting on the respective cable core are greater than the<br>
clamping forces of the longitudinally slit clamping element on the ram head. This<br>
has the effect that, when the tool is withdrawn, the cable cores can be released<br>
again from the longitudinally slit clamping element and remain in the insulation-<br>
piercing contact element. The longitudinally slit clamping element preferably has<br>
a certain resilience in this case, in particular at its lateral longitudinal webs, and<br>
is made for example from plastic. The central piece of the clamping element<br>
located between the longitudinal slots is preferably configured as an extended<br>
central web, which protrudes in the longitudinal direction slightly beyond the<br>
openings of the longitudinal slots and is beveled slightly on both sides. This<br>
allows facilitated guidance of the tool and also reliable positioning of the ram<br>
head in the terminal strip in the optimum position for the connecting and<br>
pressing-in operation.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the clamping element is formed as a<br>
separate element and is connected to the ram head. This allows particularly<br>
simple production of the tool. Furthermore, in this way it is also possible,<br>
depending on the thickness of the wire of the cable cores that are to be<br>
connected, for different clamping elements to be used on one tool. In this case,<br>
the clamping element is preferably configured as a screwed-on plate made of<br>
plastic, which is inserted in a recess of the ram head and finishes flush with the<br>
underside of the ram head. However, alternative embodiments in which the<br>
clamping element is formed from a single part together with the ram head are<br>
also conceivable.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, a swinging-out pulling hook and/or a piercing<br>
tool are attached in the tool housing. These can be swung out of their position of<br>
rest in the tool housing laterally from corresponding side slots in the tool housing<br>
into their operating position. With the pulling hook, already connected cable<br>
cores can be pulled out again from the contact slot of the insulation-piercing<br><br><br>
contact element. With the piercing tool it is possible for example to release<br>
latching connections between the terminal strip and its holder, for example by<br>
engaging behind formed-on lugs.<br>
In an alternative embodiment there is proposed a connecting tool which, in a<br>
way similar to the tool previously known from EP 0329917 Bl, has a ram which<br>
is longitudinally displaceable in the tool housing and protrudes through an<br>
opening in the end face of the tool housing, and which also has a cutter arranged<br>
on the ram head for cutting off cable cores, the longitudinal displacement of the<br>
ram serving for triggering the cutting-off operation. As a difference from the<br>
device known from EP 0329917 Bl, however, in the case of the proposed<br>
connecting tool the ram head is shaped in such a way that the end face of the<br>
ram head is provided with a longitudinally slit clamping element for receiving at<br>
least one cable core. This allows the cable core to be temporarily fixed to the<br>
ram head before the actual connecting and pressing-in operation, whereby<br>
particularly safe handling and more accurate pre-positioning of the cable core at<br>
the contact slot of the insulation-piercing contact element is made possible. This<br>
allows quick, positionally accurate and reliable connecting of cable cores. In this<br>
case, the means for fixing the cable core in the clamping element is preferably<br>
configured as a slot, which is made slightly wider than the diameter of the cable<br>
core to be connected. In order to ensure the fixing of the cable cores, a detent is<br>
in this case preferably attached to the slot opening, which is open toward the end<br>
face of the clamping element and allows the cable core to latch in the clamping<br>
element before the actual connecting and pressing-in operation at the contact<br>
slot of the insulation-piercing contact element. The opening left free by the<br>
detent on the end face of the clamping element is in this case just large enough<br>
that, after connecting, pressing-in and cutting-off of the cable core has taken<br>
place in the terminal strip, the clamping forces of the insulation-piercing contact<br>
element acting on the cable core are greater than the clamping forces of the<br>
longitudinally slit clamping element on the ram head. This has the effect that,<br>
when the tool is withdrawn, the cable core can be released again from the<br>
longitudinally slit clamping element and remains in the insulation-piercing<br>
contact element. The longitudinally slit clamping element preferably has a<br>
certain resilience in this case, in particular at its lateral longitudinal webs, and is<br>
made for example from plastic. The clamping element is preferably formed as a<br><br><br>
separate element and is connected to the ram head. This allows particularly<br>
simple production of the tool. Furthermore, in this way it is also possible,<br>
depending on the thickness of the wire of the cable core that is to be<br>
connected, for different clamping elements to be used on one tool. In the case,<br>
the clamping element is preferably configured as a screwed-on plate made of<br>
plastic, which is inserted in a recess of the ram head and finishes flush with<br>
the underside of the ram head. However, alternative embodiments in which<br>
the clamping element is formed from a single part together with the ram head<br>
are also conceivable. Otherwise, this alternative embodiment is based on the<br>
tool described more precisely in EP 0329917 B1, so that reference is made to<br>
the comments made there in their entirety.<br>

exemplary embodiment. In the accompanying drawings:<br>

Figure 5 shows a perspective representation of the tool when connecting<br>

Figure 1 shows a tool 1, which comprises a tool housing 12 which is formed<br>
by two plastic half-shells 14, 15 and forms a grip 16. The two housing half-<br>
shells 14, 15 are connected against each other by means of screws 17.<br>
Arranged in the grip 16, which is provided with an opening 33 at one end face<br>
32, is a longitudinally displaceable ram 2, which is provided with a striking<br>
mechanism, and protrudes through the opening 33 in the end face 32 of the<br>
tool housing 12. The part of the ram 2 protruding from the tool 1 comprises a<br>
ram head 5, located at the front end of the ram 2, and a ram shank 7, located<br>
between the ram head,<br><br><br>
5 and the opening 33 of the tool housing. Arranged on the ram head is a cutter<br>
29 for cutting off cable cores, the longitudinal displacement of the ram 2 serving<br>
for triggering the cutting-off operation. The cutter 29 in this case comprises two<br>
scissor blades 4, 8, which are movable with respect to each other and are<br>
arranged lying flat on the ram head 5, one over the other, an inner scissor blade<br>
8 being arranged between the ram 2 and an outer scissor blade 4. In this case,<br>
the inner scissor blade 8 is fixed, while the outer scissor blade 4 can perform a<br>
pivoting movement with respect to the inner scissor blade 8, it being possible for<br>
the pivoting movement to be triggered by means of an inclined groove and the<br>
pin 42 sliding in the inclined groove with the aid of a spring-loaded slider in the<br>
tool housing 12. The scissor blades 4 and 8 are mounted pivotably with respect<br>
to each other about a common axis. The common axis is formed by a screw 20,<br>
which connects the two scissor blades 4, 8 pivotably to each other and also to<br>
the ram 2. The outer scissor blade 4 is not in contact, either by its upper outer<br>
surface or by its two narrow outer surfaces running in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the tool 1, either with the ram head 5 or with the ram shank 7. The cutter 29<br>
is therefore attached to a certain extent such that it lies freely on the ram 2 and<br>
movement of the outer scissor blade 4 is not restricted by the geometry of the<br>
ram 2. In addition, a rotary knob 21 is provided as a fixing means in the grip 16<br>
and a latching lock 3 is arranged between two side walls 24, 25 of the ram 2.<br>
The latching lock 3 comprises a spring-loaded pawl 10, which is pivotably<br>
arranged in the ram 2. The pawl 10 assumes a defined position under spring<br>
loading, in which part of the pawl 10 that is formed in the shape of a hook<br>
engages behind the end wall 34 of the housing half-shell 15. Such a tool with a<br>
ram, slider, cutter, rotary knob and latching lock is described more precisely in<br>
EP 0329917 Bl, to which reference is expressly made. As a difference from the<br>
tool known from EP 0329917 Bl, however, in the tool 1 the ram head 5 and<br>
cutter 29 are shaped in such a way that two cable cores can be introduced<br>
simultaneously into two insulation-piercing contact elements lying next to each<br>
other and the overhanging ends of the wire can be cut off.<br>
In this case, as shown in Figure 2, the outer scissor blade 4 has a u-shaped<br>
indentation and two shearing surfaces 18, 19 with beveled cutting-edge<br>
geometry in the form of a beveled edge (chamfer), the one shearing surface 19<br>
being part of the u-shaped indentation and the other shearing surface 18 being<br><br><br>
formed by part of the narrow outer surface of the scissor blade 4 running in the<br>
longitudinal direction. Furthermore, the inner scissor blade 8 has two u-shaped<br>
indentations and two shearing surfaces, the two shearing surfaces respectively<br>
being part of one of the two u-shaped indentations. In this case, the distances<br>
between the u-shaped indentations correspond to the spacing pitch of the<br>
insulation-piercing contact elements in the terminal strip to which the cable cores<br>
are to be connected. The u-shaped indentations, and in particular the two<br>
shearing surfaces, in this case respectively form a complementary cutting edge<br>
with respect to the shearing surfaces 18, 19 of the outer scissor blade 4. In this<br>
case, the cutting-edge regions of the inner scissor blade 8 preferably correspond<br>
to the opposite cutting-edge regions of the outer scissor blade 4 and cover one<br>
another completely in the course of their shearing movement with respect to<br>
each other. The ram 2 of the tool 1 is divided into the ram head 5 and the ram<br>
shank 7 precisely by that vertical plane which runs perpendicularly in relation to<br>
the longitudinal direction of the tool 1 and includes the pivot axis of the cutter<br>
29, i.e. the screw 20. In this case, the ram shank 7 is somewhat longer than the<br>
ram head 5, in order to increase the range of the tool 1.<br>
Additionally arranged on the ram 2 is a latching lock 3, which blocks the<br>
longitudinal displacement of the ram 2 with respect to the housing 12, as shown<br>
more clearly in Figure 3. Arranged on the ram head 5 is a sensor 6, which is<br>
connected to the latching lock 3 and releases the latching lock 3 when there is<br>
actuation by a terminal strip which comprises the insulation-piercing contact<br>
elements. In this case, the sensor 6 which is arranged on the ram head 5 and is<br>
connected to the latching lock 3 only releases the longitudinal displacement when<br>
the cable core that is to be connected has fully reached the end position in the<br>
contact slot of the insulation-piercing contact element and a satisfactory<br>
connection has been established. Hooked into the spring-loaded pawl 10 is a<br>
sensor rod 9, which is led through the ram 2 up to the front part of the ram head<br>
5 and is formed there as a sensor 6 by being bent down by 90°. The sensor 6 is<br>
in this case mounted between two pressing-in plates 11 which are made of<br>
metal, are arranged parallel to each other in the ram head 5 and are configured<br>
as components which are separately fitted in the ram head 5. In order to avoid a<br>
collision of the sensor rod 9 within the ram 2 with the screw 20, the sensor rod 9<br>
is then angled away twice in the region of the screw 20 and then continued<br><br><br>
within the ram shank 7 slightly offset laterally with respect to the vertical central<br>
plane of the tool 1, so that no conflict occurs with the arrangement of the pivot<br>
axis of the scissor blades 4, 8. The sensor rod 9 consequently runs in the ram<br>
head 5 in a vertical plane running centrally through the tool 1 and in the ram<br>
shank 7 in a plane parallel to the vertical plane running centrally through the<br>
tool. When a reference point, which may be formed for example by part of the<br>
terminal strip, is reached, the mechanically acting sensor 6 exerts a force via the<br>
sensor rod 9 on the spring-loaded pawl 10 of the latching lock 3, in this way<br>
signals the correct pressing-in depth of the cable cores into the contact slot of<br>
the insulation-piercing contact element and only then releases the cutting<br>
movement for cutting off the ends of the cable cores. The pawl 10 of the<br>
latching lock 3 can also be manually unlocked independently of the sensor 6 by<br>
means of an unlocking device 13, for example for the case in which two cable<br>
cores are to be connected into the same contact slot of an insulation-piercing<br>
contact element. For this purpose, a u-shaped wire clip 44 is fastened by its two<br>
leg ends 45 onto the outside of the housing half-shells 14, 15 of the grip 16 as a<br>
locking device 13. By manual pivoting of the wire clip 44, the central part of the<br>
wire clip 44 presses against the pawl 10 and consequently pivots the pawl of the<br>
latching lock 3 inward, whereby the longitudinal displacement of the ram 2 is<br>
released. If, however, the longitudinal displacement is not to be released by the<br>
unlocking device 13 or by the sensor 6, the ram 2 can be fixed by turning the<br>
rotary knob 21. The function of the rotary knob 21 is explained more precisely in<br>
EP 0040307 Bl. Furthermore, a swinging-out pulling hook and a piercing tool<br>
are attached within the tool housing 12 between the housing half-shells 14, 15<br>
and can be swung out of their position of rest from corresponding side slots in<br>
the grip 16 with the aid of a button 43 which is beveled away on its underside.<br>
Furthermore, the end face of the ram head 5 is provided with a longitudinally slit<br>
clamping element 22 for receiving two cable cores, as shown more precisely in<br>
Figure 4 in particular, allowing the cable cores to be temporarily fixed to the ram<br>
head 5 before the actual connecting and pressing-in operation. In this case, the<br>
means for fixing the cable cores in the clamping element 22 are configured as<br>
parallel slots 26, 27, which are made slightly wider than the diameter of the<br>
cable cores to be connected. In order to ensure the fixing of the cable cores,<br>
detents 30, 31 are in this case attached to the slot openings, which are open<br><br><br>
toward the end face of the clamping element 22 and allow the cable cores to<br>
latch in the clamping element 22 before the actual connecting and pressing-in<br>
operation. The opening left free by the detents 30, 31 on the end face of the<br>
clamping element 22 is in this case just large enough that, after connecting,<br>
pressing-in and cutting-off of the cable cores has taken place in the terminal<br>
strip, the clamping forces of the insulation-piercing contact element acting on the<br>
cable core are greater than the clamping forces of the longitudinally slit clamping<br>
element 22 on the ram head 5. This has the effect that, when the tool 1 is<br>
withdrawn from the terminal strip, the cable cores that are then successfully<br>
connected to the insulation-piercing contact element can be released again from<br>
the longitudinally slit clamping element 22 and remain in the insulation-piercing<br>
contact element. The longitudinally slit clamping element 22 has a certain<br>
resilience in this case, in particular at its lateral longitudinal webs 37, 39, and is<br>
made from plastic. The central piece of the clamping element located between<br>
the longitudinal slots 26, 27 is configured as an extended central web 41, which<br>
protrudes in the longitudinal direction slightly beyond the openings of the<br>
longitudinal slots and is beveled slightly on both sides. The clamping element 22<br>
is formed as a separate element in the form of a plastic plate 23 and is<br>
connected to the ram head 5 by a screw 28. The plastic plate 23 is in this case<br>
inserted in a recess of the ram head 5 and finishes flush with the underside of<br>
the ram head 5.<br>
In Figure 5, the tool 1 is represented as it is when connecting two cores 51, 52,<br>
the two neighboring contacts of the terminal strip 60, to the left and right of the<br>
insulation-piercing contacts 53 to be wired, being protected in each case by a<br>
safety connector 54. The two cores 51, 52 are in this case inserted in the slots<br>
26, 27 of the clamping element 22, where they are temporarily fixed. The ram<br>
head 5 is in this case dimensioned in such a way that it fits between the two<br>
safety connectors 54. The length of the ram 2 is in this case long enough that,<br>
when part of the ram shank 7 enters the tool housing 12 during the connecting<br>
movement, the remaining part of the ram 2 is longer than the overall height of<br>
the safety connectors. As a result, the inserted safety connectors 54 do not<br>
hinder the connecting operation.<br><br>
