				<td>This patent application is a continuation in part of United States Patent Application, 10/935642, filed September 7, 2004, which claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application 60/501498, filed September 8, 2003, now expired.<br>
The invention relates to the field of personal care products. More specifically, the invention relates to skin conditioners, hair conditioners, hair colorants, nail colorants, and skin colorants based upon specific skin-binding, hair-binding, and nail-binding peptides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Film-forming substances are widely used in compositions for skin and hair care as conditioning agents and moisturizers, and to protect the skin and hair against environmental and chemical damage. These substances adsorb onto and/or absorb into the skin or hair, forming a protective coating. Commonly used film-forming substances include synthetic polymers, such as silicones, polyvinylpyrrolidone, acrylic acid polymers, and polysaccharides, and proteins, such as collagen, keratin, elastin, casein, silk, and soy proteins. Many proteins are known to be particularly effective film-forming agents. Because of their low solubility at the conditions used in skin and hair care products, proteins are commonly used In the form of peptides, formed by the hydrolysis of the proteins.<br>
In hair care and hair coloring compositions, film-forming substances are used to form a protective film on the surface of the hair to protect it from damage due to grooming and styling, shampooingrand exposure to ultraviolet light and the reactive chemicals commonly used In permanent wave agents, hair coloring products, bleaches, and hair straighteners, which denature the hair keratin protein. Moreover, these film-forming substances improve the elasticity of the hair. Film-forming substances that have been used in hair care products include proteins, such as keratin, collagen, soy, and silk proteins and hydrolysates thereof, and polymeric materials, such as polyacrylates, long chain alkyl quaternized amines, and<br>
siloxane polymers. For example, Cannell at al. in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,013,250 describe a hair care composition for treating hair against<br>
chemical and ultraviolet light damage. That composition comprises<br>
hydrolyzed protein, having an abundance of anionic amino acids,<br>
particularly, sulfur-containing amino acids, and divalent cations. It is<br>
proposed in that disclosure that the anionic components of the hydrolyzed<br>
protein bind to the hair by means of cationic bridges. Amino acids and<br>
their derivatives have also been used in hair care compositions to<br>
condition and strengthen hair. For example, OToole et al. in WO 0051556<br>
describe hair care compositions containing four or more amino acid<br>
compounds selected from histidine, lysine, methionine, tyrosine,<br>
tryptophan, and cysteine compounds.<br>
Film-forming substances are also used in skin care compositions to<br>
form a protective film on the skin. These films can serve to lubricate and<br>
coat the skin to passively impede the evaporation of moisture and smooth<br>
and soften the skin. Commonly used film-forming substances in skin care<br>
compositions include hydrolyzed animal and vegetable proteins (Puchalski<br>
et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,416,873, EI-Menshawy et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,482,537, and Kojima et al., JP 02311412) and silk proteins (Philippe et<br>
al., U.S. Patent No. 6,280,747 and Fahnestock et al., copending U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 10/704337). Amino acids and derivatives have<br>
also been used in skin care compositions as conditioning agents. For<br>
example, Kojima et al. in JP 06065049 describe skin care compositions<br>
containing amino acids and/or their derivatives and docosahexaenoic acid,<br>
its salts or its esters.<br>
Hair coloring agents may be divided into three categories,<br>
specifically, permanent, semi-permanent or direct, and temporary. The<br>
permanent hair dyes are generally oxidative dyes that provide hair color<br>
that lasts about four to six weeks. These oxidative hair dyes consist of two<br>
parts, one part contains the oxidative dyes in addition to other ingredients,<br>
while the second part contains an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen<br>
peroxide. The two components are mixed immediately prior to use. The<br>
oxidizing agent oxidizes the dye precursors, which then combine to form<br>
large color molecules within the hair shaft. Although the oxidative hair<br>
dyes provide long-lasting color, the oxidizing agents they contain cause<br>
hair damage. The semi-permanent or direct hair dyes are preformed dye<br>
molecules that are applied to the hair and provide color for about six to<br>
twelve shampoos. This type of hair dye is gentler to the hair because it<br>
does not contain peroxides, but the hair color does not last as long. Some<br>
improved durability is achieved by the use of nanoparticle hair coloring<br>
materials with a particle size of 10 to 500 nm, as described by Hensen et<br>
al. in WO 01045652. These nanoparticle hair coloring materials are<br>
conventional direct hair dyes that are treated to obtain nanoscale<br>
dimensions and exhibit increased absorption into the hair. Temporary hair<br>
dyes are coloring agents that are applied to the hair surface and are<br>
removed after one shampoo. It would be desirable to develop a hair<br>
coloring agent that provides the durability of the permanent hair dyes<br>
without the use of oxidizing agents that damage hair.<br>
The major problem with the current skin care and hair care<br>
compositions, non-oxidative hair dyes, as well as nail coloring agents is<br>
that they lack the required durability required for long-lasting effects. For<br>
this reason, there have been attempts to enhance the binding of the<br>
cosmetic agent to the hair, skin or nails. For example, Richardson et al. in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,490,980 and Green et al. in U.S. Patent No. 6,267,957<br>
describe the covalent attachment of cosmetic agents, such as skin<br>
conditioners, hair conditioners, coloring agents, sunscreens, and<br>
perfumes, to hair, skin, and nails using the enzyme transglutaminase.<br>
This enzyme crosslinks an amine moiety on the cosmetic agent to the<br>
glutamine residues in skin, hair, and nails. Similarly, Green et al. in WO<br>
0107009 describe the use of the enzyme lysine oxidase to covalently<br>
attach cosmetic agents to hair, skin, and nails.<br>
In another approach, cosmetic agents have been covalently<br>
attached to proteins or protein hydrolysates. For example, Lang et al. in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,192,332 describe temporary coloring compositions that<br>
contain an animal or vegetable protein, or hydrolysate thereof, which<br>
contain residues of dye molecules grafted onto the protein chain. In those<br>
compositions, the protein serves as a conditioning agent and does not<br>
enhance the binding of the cosmetic agent to hair, skin, or nails. Horikoshi<br>
et al. in JP 08104614 and Igarashi et al. in U.S. Patent No. 5,597,386<br>
describe hair coloring agents that consist of an anti-keratin antibody<br>
covalently attached to a dye or pigment. The antibody binds to the hair,<br>
thereby enhancing the binding of the hair coloring agent to the hair.<br>
Similarly, Kizawa et al. in JP 09003100 describe an antibody that<br>
recognizes the surface layer of hair and its use to treat hair. A hair<br>
coloring agent consisting of that anti-hair antibody coupled to colored latex<br>
particles is also described. The use of antibodies to enhance the binding<br>
of dyes to the hair is effective in increasing the durability of the hair<br>
coloring, but these antibodies are difficult and expensive to produce.<br>
Terada et al. in JP 2002363026 describe the use of conjugates consisting<br>
of single-chain antibodies, preferably anti-keratin, coupled to dyes,<br>
ligands, and cosmetic agents for skin and hair care compositions. The<br>
single-chain antibodies may be prepared using genetic engineering<br>
techniques, but are still difficult and expensive to prepare because of their<br>
large size. Findlay in WO 00048558 describes the use of calycin proteins,<br>
such as p-lactoglobulin, which contain a binding domain for a cosmetic<br>
agent and another binding domain that binds to at least a part of the<br>
surface of a hair fiber or skin surface, for conditioners, dyes, and<br>
perfumes. Again these proteins are large and difficult and expensive to<br>
produce.<br>
Linter in U.S. Patent No. 6,620,419 describes peptides grafted to a<br>
fatty acid chain and their use in cosmetic and dermopharmaceutical<br>
applications. The peptides described in that disclosure are chosen<br>
because they stimulate the synthesis of collagen; they are not specific<br>
binding peptides that enhance the durability of hair and skin conditioners,<br>
and hair, nail, and skin colorants.<br>
Since its introduction in 1985, phage display has been widely used<br>
to discover a variety of ligands including peptides, proteins and small<br>
molecules for drug targets (Dixit, J. ofSci. &amp; Ind. Research, 57:173-183<br>
(1998)). The applications have expanded to other areas such as studying<br>
protein folding, novel catalytic activities, DNA-binding proteins with novel<br>
specificities, and novel peptide-based biomaterial scaffolds for tissue<br>
engineering (Hoess, Chem. Rev. 101:3205-3218 (2001) and Holmes,<br>
Trends Biotechnol. 20:16-21 (2002)). Whaley et al. (Nature 405:665-668<br>
(2000)) disclose the use of phage display screening to identify peptide<br>
sequences that can bind specifically to different crystallographic forms of<br>
inorganic semiconductor substrates.<br>
A modified screening method that comprises contacting a peptide<br>
library with an anti-target to remove peptides that bind to the anti-target,<br>
then contacting the non-binding peptides with the target has been<br>
described (Estell et al. WO 0179479, Murray et al. U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2002/0098524, and Janssen et al. U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2003/0152976). Using that method, a peptide sequence<br>
that binds to hair and not to skin, given as SEQ ID NO:1, and a peptide<br>
sequence that binds to skin and not hair, given as SEQ ID N0:2, were<br>
identified. Using the same method, Janssen et al. (WO 04048399)<br>
identified other skin-binding and hair-binding peptides, as well as several<br>
binding motifs. Although the potential use of these peptides in personal<br>
care applications is suggested in those disclosures, the coupling of these<br>
peptides to coloring agents and conditioning agents to prepare high-affinity<br>
hair conditioners, skin conditioners, hair colorants, nail colorants and skin<br>
colorants is not described. A method for identifying high-affinity phagepeptide<br>
clones is also described in those disclosures. The method<br>
involves using PCR to identify peptides that remain bound to the target<br>
after acid elution.<br>
Reisch (Chem. Eng. News 80:16-21 (2002)) reports that a family of<br>
peptides designed to target an ingredient of specific human tissue has<br>
been developed for personal care applications. However, no description<br>
of peptide-based conditioners or coloring agents are disclosed in that<br>
publication.<br>
One of the peptide binding sequences of the instant invention,<br>
given as SEQ ID NO:3, has been reported for several other purposes. For<br>
example, Hupp et al. in WO 02065134 disclose the peptide sequence<br>
5<br>
SEQ ID N0:3 as a peptide for use in modulating the binding of a p53<br>
polypeptide to a p300 polypeptide, useful for regulating the mammalian<br>
cell cycle or to induce or prevent cell death. Liu et al. in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,344,443 describe the use of that same peptide sequence to inhibit<br>
binding of tumor necrosis factor alpha to its receptor for preventing or<br>
reversing inflammatory changes in patients with arthritis and other<br>
inflammatory diseases. Another peptide binding sequence of the instant<br>
invention, given as SEQ ID NO:4, was reported by Jagota et al. in WO<br>
03102020 as a carbon nanotube-binding peptide.<br>
In view of the above, a need exists for hair and skin conditioners,<br>
and hair, nail, and skin colorants that provide improved durability for long<br>
lasting effects and are easy and inexpensive to prepare.<br>
Applicants have met the stated needs by identifying peptide<br>
sequences using phage display screening that specifically bind to body<br>
surfaces, such as, hair, skin, nails, teeth, gums, cornea! tissue, and oral<br>
cavity surfaces, with high affinity and using them to design peptide-based<br>
body surface reagents, such as, hair conditioners, skin conditioners, hair<br>
colorants, nail colorants, skin colorants, and oral care reagents.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides peptide sequences that specifically<br>
bind to human body surfaces such as hair, skin, nails, teeth, gums, and<br>
the like with high affinity. Additionally, the present invention provides<br>
peptide based body surface reagents that are comprised of body surface<br>
binding peptides coupled with various benefit agents that convey a benefit<br>
to the body surface. Typical of the compositions of the invention are<br>
peptide-based hair and skin conditioners, and hair, nail, and skin colorants<br>
with improved durability.<br>
The peptide based body surface reagents of the invention provide<br>
benefits and an advance over the art in the development of personal care<br>
products. Because the reagents are peptide based they are able to bind<br>
strongly to surfaces from an aqueous environment, thus in many cases<br>
being both water soluble and water fast. Additionally, because of the<br>
aqueous nature of the reagents they may be removed from body surfaces<br>
without of the use of odor producing chemicals. The reagents of the<br>
invention bind almost immediately to the target body surface, eliminating<br>
the need for long drying times, typical of most personal care applications.<br>
Additionally the reagents of the invention are specific in their affinity for<br>
body surfaces, making the need to isolate their application to a specific<br>
surface unnecessary. Thus a regent that binds hair for coloring will not<br>
bind skin and visa versa. Most importantly, the peptide nature of the<br>
reagents makes them virtually non-toxic and non-irritating to exposed<br>
body surfaces such as the skin and the membranes of the eyes and<br>
mouth.<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
"Gene" refers to a nucleic acid fragment that expresses a specific<br>
protein, including regulatory sequences preceding (51 non-coding<br>
sequences) and following (3' non-coding sequences) the coding<br>
sequence. "Native gene" refers to a gene as found in nature with its own<br>
regulatory sequences "Chimeric gene" refers to any gene that is not a<br>
native gene, comprising regulatory and coding sequences that are not<br>
found together in nature. Accordingly, a chimeric gene may comprise<br>
regulatory sequences and coding sequences that are derived from<br>
different sources, or regulatory sequences and coding sequences derived<br>
from the same source, but arranged in a manner different than that found<br>
in nature. A "foreign" gene refers to a gene not normally found in the host<br>
organism, but that is introduced into the host organism by gene transfer.<br>
Foreign genes can comprise native genes inserted into a non-native<br>
organism, or chimeric genes.<br>
"Synthetic genes" can be assembled from oligonucleotide building<br>
blocks that are chemically synthesized using procedures known to those<br>
skilled in the art. These building blocks are ligated and annealed to form<br>
gene segments which are then enzymatically assembled to construct the<br>
entire gene. "Chemically synthesized", as related to a sequence of DMA,<br>
means that the component nucleotides were assembled in vitro. Manual<br>
chemical synthesis of DMA may be accomplished using well-established<br>
procedures, or automated chemical synthesis can be performed using one<br>
of a number of commercially available machines. Accordingly, the genes<br>
can be tailored for optimal gene expression based on optimization of<br>
nucleotide sequence to reflect the codon bias of the host cell. The skilled<br>
artisan appreciates the likelihood of successful gene expression if codon<br>
usage is biased towards those codons favored by the host. Determination<br>
of preferred codons can be based on a survey of genes derived from the<br>
host cell where sequence information is available.<br>
"Coding sequence" refers to a DMA sequence that codes for a<br>
specific amino acid sequence. "Suitable regulatory sequences" refer to<br>
nucleotide sequences located upstream (51 non-coding sequences), within,<br>
or downstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and<br>
which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or<br>
translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences<br>
may include promoters, translation leader sequences, introns,<br>
polyadenylation recognition sequences, RNA processing site, effector<br>
binding site and stem-loop structure.<br>
i "Promoter" refers to a DNA sequence capable of controlling the<br>
expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coxiing<br>
sequence is located 3' to a promoter sequence. Promoters may be<br>
derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different<br>
elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even<br>
20 comprise synthetic DNA segments. It is understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different<br>
tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response<br>
to different environmental or physiological conditions. Promoters which<br>
cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times are<br>
commonly referred to as "constitutive promoters". It is further recognized<br>
that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences<br>
have not been completely defined, DNA fragments of different lengths may<br>
have identical promoter activity.<br>
The term "expression", as used herein, refers to the transcription<br>
and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from<br>
the nucleic acid fragment of the invention. Expression may also refer to<br>
translation of mRNA into a polypeptide.<br>
The term "transformation" refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid<br>
fragment into the genome of a host organism, resulting in genetically<br>
stable inheritance. Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic<br>
acid fragments are referred to as "transgenic" or "recombinant" or<br>
"transformed" organisms.<br>
The term "host cell" refers to cell which has been transformed or<br>
transfected, or is capable of transformation or transfection by an<br>
exogenous polynucleotide sequence.<br>
The terms "plasmid", "vector" and "cassette" refer to an extra<br>
chromosomal element often carrying genes which are not part of the<br>
central metabolism of the cell, and usually in the form of circular doublestranded<br>
DMA molecules. Such elements may be autonomously<br>
replicating sequences, genome integrating sequences, phage or<br>
nucleotide sequences, linear or circular, of a single- or double-stranded<br>
DMA or RNA, derived from any source, in which a number of nucleotide<br>
sequences have been joined or recombined into a unique construction<br>
which is capable of introducing a promoter fragment and DNA sequence<br>
for a selected gene product along with appropriate 3' untranslated<br>
sequence into a cell. "Transformation cassette" refers to a specific vector<br>
containing a foreign gene and having elements in addition to the foreign<br>
gene that facilitate transformation of a particular host cell. "Expression<br>
cassette" refers to a specific vector containing a foreign gene and having<br>
elements in addition to the foreign gene that allow for enhanced<br>
expression of that gene in a foreign host.<br>
The term "phage" or "bacteriophage" refers to a virus that infects<br>
bacteria. Altered forms may be used for the purpose of the present<br>
invention. The preferred bacteriophage is derived from the "wild" phage,<br>
called M13. The M13 system can grow inside a bacterium, so that it does<br>
not destroy the cell it infects but causes it to make new phages<br>
continuously. It is a single-stranded DNA phage.<br>
The term "phage display" refers to the display of functional foreign<br>
peptides or small proteins on the surface of bacteriophage or phagemid<br>
particles. Genetically engineered phage may be used to present peptides<br>
as segments of their native surface proteins. Peptide libraries may be<br>
produced by populations of phage with different gene sequences.<br>
"PCR" or "polymerase chain reaction" is a technique used for the<br>
amplification of specific DNA segments (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195 and<br>
4,800,159).<br>
Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used<br>
herein are well known in the art and are described by Sambrook, J.,<br>

The present invention comprises specific hair-binding, skin-binding,<br>
and nail-binding peptides and their use in conditioners and coloring agents<br>
for the hair, skin, and nails.<br>
Body Surfaces<br>
Body surfaces of the invention are any surface on the human body<br>
that will serve as a substrate for a binding peptide. Typical body surfaces<br>
include, but are not limited to hair, skin, nails, teeth, gums, corneal tissue<br>
and the tissues of the oral cavity. In many cases the body surfaces of the<br>
invention will be exposed to air, however in some instances, the oral cavity<br>
for example, the surfaces will be internal. Accordingly body surfaces may<br>
include layers of both epithelial and well as endothelial cells.<br>
Samples of body surfaces are available from a variety of sources.<br>
For example, human hair samples are available commercially, for example<br>
from International Hair Importers and Products (Bellerose, NY), in different<br>
colors, such as brown, black, red, and blond, and in various types, such as<br>
African-American, Caucasian, and Asian. Additionally, the hair samples<br>
may be treated for example using hydrogen peroxide to obtain bleached<br>
hair. Pig skin, available from butcher shops and supermarkets, Vitro-<br>
Skin®, available from IMS Inc. (Milford, CT), and EpiDerm™, available<br>
from MatTek Corp. (Ashland, MA), are good substitutes for human skin.<br>
Human fingernails and toenails may be obtained from volunteers.<br>
Extracted human teeth and false teeth may be obtained from Dental<br>
offices. Additionally, hydroxyapatite, available in many forms for example<br>
from Berkeley Advanced Biomaterials, Inc. (San Leandro, CA) may be<br>
used as a model for human teeth.<br>
Body Surface-Binding Peptides<br>
Body surface-binding peptides as defined herein are peptide<br>
sequences that specifically bind with high affinity to specific body surfaces,<br>
including, but not limited to hair, skin, nails, teeth, tongue, cheeks, lips,<br>
gums, corneal tissue and the tissues of the oral cavity, for example. Body<br>
surface-binding peptides of the present invention are from about 7 amino<br>
acids to about 45 amino acids, more preferably, from about 7 amino acids<br>
to about 20 amino acids. The binding peptides of the invention have a<br>
binding affinity for their respective substrate, as measured<br>
values, of less than or equal to about 10~2 M, less than or equal to about<br>
10~3 M, less than or equal to about 10~4 M, less than or equal to about 10~5<br>
M, preferably less than or equal to about 10~6 M, and more preferably less<br>
than or equal to about 10~7 M.<br>
Suitable body surface-binding peptide sequences may be selected<br>
using methods that are well known in the art. The peptides of the present<br>
invention are generated randomly and then selected against a specific<br>
body surface, for example, hair, skin, nail ,or oral cavity surface sample,<br>
based upon their binding affinity for the surface of interest. The generation<br>
of random libraries of peptides is well known and may be accomplished by<br>

technology (U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409, U.S. Patent No. 5,403,484, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,571,698, U.S. Patent No. 5,837,500). Techniques to<br>
generate such biological peptide libraries are described in Dani, M, J. of<br>
Receptor &amp; Signal Transduction Res., 21(4):447-468 (2001).<br>
A preferred method to randomly generate peptides.is by phage<br>
display. Phage display Is an in vitro selection technique in which a peptide<br>
or protein is genetically fused to a coat protein of a bacteriophage,<br>
resulting in display of fused peptide on the exterior of the phage virion,<br>
while the DNA encoding the fusion resides within the virion. This physical<br>
linkage between the displayed peptide and the DNA encoding it allows<br>
screening of vast numbers of variants of peptides, each linked to a<br>
corresponding DNA sequence, by a simple in vitro selection procedure<br>
called "biopanning". In its simplest form, biopanning is carried out by<br>
incubating the pool of phage-displayed variants with a target of interest<br>
that has been immobilized on a plate or bead, washing away unbound<br>
phage, and eluting specifically bound phage by disrupting the binding<br>
interactions between the phage and the target. The eluted phage is then<br>
amplified in vivo and the process is repeated, resulting in a stepwise<br>
enrichment of the phage pool in favor of the tightest binding sequences.<br>
After 3 or more rounds of selection/amplification, individual clones are<br>
characterized by DNA sequencing.<br>
After a suitable library of peptides has been generated, they are<br>
then contacted with an appropriate amount of the test substrate,<br>
specifically a body surface sample. The library of peptides is dissolved in a<br>
suitable solution for contacting the sample. The body surface sample may<br>
be suspended in the solution or may be immobilized on a plate or bead. A<br>
preferred solution is a buffered aqueous saline solution containing a<br>
surfactant. A suitable solution is Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.5%<br>
Tween® 20. The solution may additionally be agitated by any means in<br>
order to increase the mass transfer rate of the peptides to body surface<br>
sample, thereby shortening the time required to attain maximum binding.<br>
Upon contact, a number of the randomly generated peptides will<br>
bind to the body surface sample to form a peptide-body-surface complex,<br>
for example a peptide-hair, peptide-skin, peptide-nail, or peptide-oral<br>
cavity surface complex. Unbound peptide may be removed by washing.<br>
After all unbound material is removed, peptides having varying degrees of<br>
binding affinities for the test surface may be fractionated by selected<br>
washings in buffers having varying stringencies. Increasing the stringency<br>
of the buffer used increases the required strength of the bond between the<br>
peptide and body surface in the peptide-body surface complex.<br>
A number of substances may be used to vary the stringency of the<br>
buffer solution in peptide selection including, but not limited to, acidic pH<br>
(1.5-3.0); basic pH (10-12.5); high salt concentrations such as MgCfe (3-5<br>
M) and LiCI (5-10 M); water; ethylene glycol (25-50%); dioxane (5-20%);<br>
thiocyanate (1-5 M); guanidine (2-5 M); urea (2-8 M); and various<br>
concentrations of different surfactants such as SDS (sodium dodecyl<br>
sulfate), DOC (sodium deoxycholate), Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, Tween®<br>
20, wherein Tween® 20 is preferred. These substances may be prepared<br>
in buffer solutions including, but not limited to, Tris-HCI, Tris-buffered<br>
saline, Tris-borate, Tris-acetic acid, triethylamine, phosphate buffer, and<br>
glycine-HCl, wherein Tris-buffered saline solution is preferred.<br>
It will be appreciated that peptides having increasing binding<br>
affinities for body surface substrates may be eluted by repeating the<br>
selection process using buffers with increasing stringencies.<br>
The eluted peptides can be identified and sequenced by any means<br>
known in the art.<br>
Thus, the following method for generating the body surface-binding<br>
peptides, for example, hair-binding peptides, skin-binding peptides, nailbinding<br>
peptides, or oral cavity surface-binding peptides, of the present<br>
invention was used. A library of combinatorial generated phage-peptides<br>
is contacted with the body surface of interest, to form phage peptide-body<br>
surface complexes. The phage-peptide-body-surface complex is<br>
separated from uncomplexed peptides and unbound substrate, and the<br>
bound phage-peptides from the phage-peptide-body surface complexes is<br>
eluted from the complex, preferably by acid treatment. Then, the eluted<br>
peptides are identified and sequenced. To identify peptide sequences that<br>
bind to one substrate but not to another, for example peptides that bind to<br>
hair, but not to skin or peptides that bind to skin, but not to hair, a<br>
subtractive panning step is added. Specifically, the library of combinatorial<br>
generated phage-peptides is first contacted with the non-target to remove<br>
phage-peptides that bind to it. Then, the non-binding phage-peptides are<br>
contacted with the desired substrate and the above process is followed.<br>
Alternatively, the library of combinatorial generated phage-peptides may<br>
be contacted with the non-target and the desired substrate simultaneously.<br>
Then, the phage-peptide-body surface complexes are separated from the<br>
phage-peptide-non-target complexes and the method described above is<br>
followed for the desired phage-peptide-body surface complexes.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a modified<br>
phage display screening method for isolating peptides with a higher affinity<br>
for body surfaces. In the modified method, the phage-peptide-body<br>
surface complexes are formed as described above. Then, these<br>
complexes are treated with an elution buffer. Any of the elution buffers<br>
described above may be used. Preferably, the elution buffer is an acidic<br>
solution. Then, the remaining, elution-resistant phage-peptide-body<br>
surface complexes are used to directly infect a bacterial host cell, such as<br>
£. co// ER2738. The infected host cells are grown in an appropriate<br>
growth medium, such as LB (Luria-Bertani) medium, and this culture is<br>
spread onto agar, containing a suitable growth medium, such as LB<br>
medium with IPTG (isopropyl p-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and S-Gal™.<br>
After growth, the plaques are picked for DNA isolation and sequencing to<br>
identify the peptide sequences with a high binding affinity for the body<br>
surface of interest.<br>
In another embodiment, PCR may be used to identify the elutionresistant<br>
phage-peptides from the modified phage display screening<br>
method, described above, by directly carrying out PCR on the phagepeptide-<br>
body surface complexes using the appropriate primers, as<br>
described by Janssen et al. in U.S. Patent Application Publication No.<br>
2003/0152976, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Hair-binding, skin-binding, and nail-binding peptides have been<br>
identified using the above methods. Specifically, binding peptides were<br>
isolated that have a high affinity for normal brown hair, given as SEQ ID<br>
N0s:3-18, 28-38, 40-56, and 64; shampoo resistant, normal brown hair,<br>
given as SEQ ID NO:66, 69 and 70; bleached hair, given as SEQ ID<br>
NOs:7, 8, 19-27, 38-40, 43, 44, 47, 57, 58, and 59, fingernail, given as<br>
SEQ ID NOs:53 and 60; and skin, given as SEQ ID NO:61. Additionally,<br>
the fingernail-binding peptides were found to bind to bleached hair and<br>
may be used in the peptide-based hair conditioners and hair colorants of<br>
the invention. The bleached hair-binding peptides will bind to fingernails<br>
and may be used in the peptide-based nail colorants of the invention.<br>
Production of Binding Peptides<br>
The binding peptides of the present invention may be prepared<br>
using standard peptide synthesis methods, which are well known in the art<br>
(see for example Stewart et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Pierce<br>
Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, 1984; Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide<br>
Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1984; and Pennington etal.,<br>
Peptide Synthesis Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, 1994).<br>
Additionally, many companies offer custom peptide synthesis services.<br>
Alternatively, the peptides of the present invention may be prepared<br>
using recombinant DMA and molecular cloning techniques. Genes<br>
encoding the hair-binding, skin-binding or nail-binding peptides may be<br>
produced in heterologous host cells, particularly In the cells of microbial<br>
hosts.<br>
Preferred heterologous host cells for expression of the binding<br>
peptides of the present invention are microbial hosts that can be found<br>
broadly within the fungal or bacterial families and which grow over a wide<br>
range of temperature, pH values, and solvent tolerances. Because<br>
transcription, translation, and the protein biosynthetic apparatus are the<br>
same irrespective of the cellular feedstock, functional genes are expressed<br>
irrespective of carbon feedstock used to generate cellular biomass.<br>
Examples of host strains include, but are not limited to, fungal or yeast<br>
species such as Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Saccharomyces, Pichia,<br>
Candida, Hansenula, or bacterial species such as Salmonella, Bacillus,<br>
Acinetobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, Escherichia, Pseudomonas,<br>
Methylomonas, Methylobacter, Alcaligenes, Synechocystis, Anabaena,<br>
Thiobacillus, Methanobacterium and Klebsiella.<br>
A variety of expression systems can be used to produce the<br>
peptides of the present invention. Such vectors include, but are not limited<br>
to, chromosomal, episomal and virus-derived vectors, e.g., vectors derived<br>
from bacterial plasmids, from bacteriophage, from transposons, from<br>
insertion elements, from yeast episoms, from viruses such as<br>
baculoviruses, retroviruses and vectors derived from combinations thereof<br>
such as those derived from piasmid and bacteriophage genetic elements,<br>
such as cosmids and phagemids. The expression system constructs may<br>
contain regulatory regions that regulate as well as engender expression.<br>
In general, any system or vector suitable to maintain, propagate or<br>
express polynucleotide or polypeptide in a host cell may be used for<br>
expression in this regard. Microbial expression systems and expression•»<br>
vectors contain regulatory sequences that direct high level expression of<br>
foreign proteins relative to the growth of the host cell. Regulatory<br>
sequences are well known to those skilled in the art and examples include,<br>
but are not limited to, those which cause the expression of a gene to be<br>
turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including<br>
the presence of regulatory elements in the vector, for example, enhancer<br>
sequences. Any of these could be used to construct chimeric genes for<br>
production of the any of the binding peptides of the present invention.<br>
These chimeric genes could then be introduced into appropriate<br>
microorganisms via transformation to provide high level expression of the<br>
peptides.<br>
Vectors or cassettes useful for the transformation of suitable host<br>
cells are well known in the art. Typically the vector or cassette contains<br>
sequences directing transcription and translation of the relevant gene, one<br>
or more selectable markers, and sequences allowing autonomous<br>
replication or chromosomal integration. Suitable vectors comprise a<br>
region 5' of the gene, which harbors transcriptional initiation controls and a<br>
region 3' of the DMA fragment which controls transcriptiona! termination. It<br>
is most preferred when both control regions are derived from genes<br>
homologous to the transformed host cell, although it is to be understood<br>
that such control regions need not be derived from the genes native to the<br>
specific species chosen as a production host. Selectable marker genes<br>
provide a phenotypic trait for selection of the transformed host cells such<br>
as tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in E, coll.<br>
Initiation control regions or promoters which are useful to drive<br>
expression of the chimeric gene in the desired host cell are numerous and<br>
familiar to those skilled in the art. Virtually any promoter capable of driving<br>
the gene is suitable for producing the binding peptides of the present<br>
invention including, but not limited to: CYC1, HIS3, GAL1, GAL10, ADH1,<br>
PGK, PH05, GAPDH, ADC1, TRP1, URA3, LEU2, ENO, TPI (useful for .<br>
expression in Saccharomyces); AOX1 (useful for expression in Pichia);<br>
and lac, ara, tet, tip, IP\_, IPp^, 17, tac, and trc (useful for expression in<br>
Escherichia coli) as well as the amy, apr, npr promoters and various phage<br>
promoters useful for expression in Bacillus.<br>
Termination control regions may also be derived from various<br>
genes native to the preferred hosts. Optionally, a termination site may be<br>
unnecessary, however, it is most preferred if included.<br>
The vector containing the appropriate DNA sequence as described<br>
supra, as well as an appropriate promoter or control sequence, may be<br>
employed to transform an appropriate host to permit the host to express<br>
the peptide of the present invention. Cell-free translation systems can also<br>
be employed to produce such peptides using RNAs derived from the DNA<br>
constructs of the present invention. Optionally it may be desired to<br>
produce the instant gene product as a secretion product of the<br>
transformed host. Secretion of desired proteins into the growth media has<br>
the advantages of simplified and less costly purification procedures. It is<br>
well known in the art that secretion signal sequences are often useful in<br>
facilitating the active transport of expressible proteins across cell<br>
membranes. The creation of a transformed host capable of secretion may<br>
be accomplished by the incorporation of a DNA sequence that codes for a<br>
secretion signal which is functional in the production host. Methods for<br>
choosing appropriate signal sequences are well known in the art (see for<br>
example EP 546049 and WO 9324631). The secretion signal DNA or<br>
facilitator may be located between the expression-controlling DNA and the<br>
instant gene or gene fragment, and in the same reading frame with the<br>
latter.<br>
Peptide-Based Hair Conditioners<br>
The peptide-based'hair conditioners of the present invention are<br>
formed by coupling a hair-binding peptide (HBP) with a hair conditioning<br>
agent (HCA). The hair-binding peptide part of the conditioner binds<br>
strongly to the hair, thus keeping the conditioning agent attached to the<br>
hair for a long lasting conditioning effect. The hair-binding peptides<br>
include, but are not limited to, hair-binding peptides selected by the<br>
screening methods described above, including the hair-binding peptide<br>
sequences of the invention, given by SEQ ID NOs: 3-59, 64, 66, 69, and<br>
70, most preferably the peptides given by SEQ ID NO:46 and SEQ ID<br>
NO:66, which bind strongly to hair, but not to skin. Additionally, any known<br>
hair-binding peptide may be used, including but not limited to SEQ ID<br>
NO:1, and SEQ ID NOs:76-98, described by Janssen et al. in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2003/0152976 and by Janssen et al. in WO<br>
04048399, respectively, both of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. For bleached hair, the fingernail-binding peptide, given as SEQ<br>
ID NO:60, may also be used.<br>
Hair conditioning agents as herein defined are agents which<br>
improve the appearance, texture, and sheen of hair as well as increasing<br>
hair body or suppleness. Hair conditioning agents, include, but are not<br>
limited to, styling aids, hair straightening aids, hair strengthening aids, and<br>
volumizing agents, such as nanoparticles. In the peptide-based hair<br>
conditioners of the present invention, any known hair conditioning agent<br>
may be used. Hair conditioning agents are well known in the art, see for<br>
example Green et al. (WO 0107009), incorporated herein,by reference,<br>
and are available commercially from various sources. Suitable examples<br>
of hair conditioning agents include, but are not limited to, cationic<br>
polymers, such as cationized guar gum, diallyl quaternary ammonium<br>
salt/acrylamide copolymers, quaternized polyvinylpyrrolidone and<br>
derivatives thereof, and various polyquaternium-compounds; cationic<br>
surfactants, such as stearalkonium chloride, centrimonium chloride, and<br>
Sapamin hydrochloride; fatty alcohols, such as behenyl alcohol; fatty<br>
amines, such as stearyl amine; waxes; esters; nonionic polymers, such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyethylene glycol; silicones;<br>
siloxanes, such as decamethylcyclopentasiloxane; polymer emulsions,<br>
such as amodimethicone; and nanoparticles, such as silica nanoparticles<br>
and polymer nanoparticles. The preferred hair conditioning agents of the<br>
present invention contain amine or hydroxyl functional groups to facilitate<br>
coupling to the hair-binding peptides, as described below. Examples of<br>
preferred conditioning agents are octylamine (CAS No. 111-86-4), stearyl<br>
amine (CAS No. 124-30-1), behenyl alcohol (CAS No. 661-19-8, Cognis<br>
Corp., Cincinnati, OH), vinyl group terminated siloxanes, vinyl group<br>
terminated silicone (CAS No. 68083-19-2), vinyl group terminated methyl<br>
vinyl siloxanes, vinyl group terminated methyl vinyl silicone (CAS No.<br>
68951-99-5), hydroxyl terminated siloxanes, hydroxyl terminated silicone<br>
(CAS No. 80801-30-5), amino-modified silicone derivatives,<br>
[(aminoethyl)amino]propyl hydroxyl dimethyl siloxanes,<br>
[(aminoethyl)amino]propyl hydroxyl dimethyl silicones, and alpha-tridecylomega-<br>
hydroxy-poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) (CAS No. 24938-91-8).<br>
The peptide-based hair conditioners of the present invention are<br>
prepared by coupling a specific hair-binding peptide to a hair conditioning<br>
agent, either directly or via an optional spacer. The coupling interaction<br>
may be a covalent bond or a non-covalent interaction, such as hydrogen<br>
bonding, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, or Van der<br>
Waals interaction. In the case of a non-covalent interaction, the peptidebased<br>
hair conditioner may be prepared by mixing the peptide with the<br>
conditioning agent and the optional spacer (if used) and allowing sufficient<br>
time for the interaction to occur. The unbound materials may be separated<br>
from the resulting peptide-based hair conditioner adduct using methods<br>
known in the art, for example, gel permeation chromatography.<br>
The peptide-based hair conditioners of the invention may also be<br>
prepared by covalently attaching a specific hair-binding peptide to a hair<br>
conditioning agent, either directly or through a spacer. Any known peptide<br>
or protein conjugation chemistry may be used to form the peptide-based<br>
hair conditioners of the present invention. Conjugation chemistries are<br>
well-known in the art (see for example, Hermanson, Bioconjugate<br>
Techniques, Academic Press, New York (1996)). Suitable coupling agents<br>
include, but are not limited to, carbodiimide coupling agents, diacid<br>
chlorides, diisocyanates and other difunctional coupling reagents that are<br>
reactive toward terminal amine and/or carboxylic acid terminal groups on<br>
the peptides and to amine, carboxylic acid, or alcohol groups on the hair<br>
conditioning agent. The preferred coupling agents are carbodiimide<br>
coupling agents, such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide<br>
(EDC) and N,N'-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC), which may be used to<br>
activate carboxylic acid groups for coupling to alcohol, and amine groups.<br>
Additionally, it may be necessary to protect reactive amine or carboxylic<br>
&gt;<br>
acid groups on the peptide to produce the desired structure for the<br>
peptide-based hair conditioner. The use of protecting groups for amino<br>
acids, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc), are well known in the art (see for<br>
example Stewart et al., supra; Bodanszky, supra; and Pennington et al.f<br>
supra). In some cases it may be necessary to introduce reactive groups,<br>
such as carboxylic acid, alcohol, amine, or aldehyde groups, on the hair<br>
conditioning ayent for coupling to the hair-binding peptide. These<br>
modifications may be done using routine chemistry such as oxidation,<br>
reduction and the like, which is well known in the art.<br>
It may also be desirable to couple the hair-binding peptide to the<br>
hair conditioning agent via a spacer. The spacer serves to separate the<br>
conditioning agent from the peptide to ensure that the agent does not<br>
interfere with the binding of the peptide to the hair. The spacer may be<br>
any of a variety of molecules, such as alkyl chains, phenyl compounds,<br>
ethylene glycol, amides, esters and the like. Preferred spacers are<br>
hydrophilic and have a chain length from 1 to about 100 atoms, more<br>
preferably, from 2 to about 30 atoms. Examples of preferred spacers<br>
include, but are not limited to ethanol amine, ethylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
with a chain length of 6 carbon atoms, polyethylene glycol with 3 to 6<br>
repeating units, phenoxyethanol, propanolamide, butylene glycol,<br>
butyleneglycolamide, propyl phenyl chains, and ethyl, propyl, hexyl, steryl,<br>
cetyl, and palmitoyl alkyl chains. The spacer may be covalently attached to<br>
the peptide and the hair conditioning agent using any of the coupling<br>
chemistries described above. In order to facilitate incorporation of the<br>
spacer, a bifunctional cross-linking agent that contains a spacer and<br>
reactive groups at both ends for coupling to the peptide and the<br>
conditioning agent may be used. Suitable bifunctional cross-linking agents<br>
are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to diamines, such<br>
a as 1,6-diaminohexane; dialdehydes, such as glutaraldehyde; bis Nhydroxysuccinimide<br>
esters, such as ethylene glycol-bis(succinic acid Nhydroxysuccinimide<br>
ester), disuccinimidyl glutarate, disuccinimidyl<br>
suberate, and ethylene glycol-bis(succinimidylsuccinate); diisoqyantes,<br>
such as hexamethylenediisocyanate; bis oxiranes, such as 1,4 butanediyl<br>
diglycidyl ether; dicarboxylic acids, such as succinyldisalicylate; and the<br>
like. Heterobifunctional cross-linking agents, which contain a different<br>
reactive group at each end, may also be used. Examples of<br>
heterobifunctional cross-linking agents include, but are not limited to<br>
compounds having the following structure:<br>
where : RI is H or a substituent group such as -SOsNa, -NO2, or -Br; and<br>
R2 is a spacer such as -CH2CH2 (ethyl), -(CH2)s (propyl), or -(Ch^bCeHs<br>
(propyl phenyl). An example of such a heterobifunctional cross-linking<br>
agent is 3-maleimidopropionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The Nhydroxysuccinimide<br>
ester group of these reagents reacts with amine or<br>
alcohol groups on the conditioner, while the maleimide group reacts with<br>
thiol groups present on the peptide. A thiol group may be incorporated<br>
into the peptide by adding a cysteine group to at least one end of the<br>
binding peptide sequence (i.e., the C-terminus or N-terminus). Several<br>
spacer amino acid residues, such as glycine, may be incorporated<br>
between the binding peptide sequence and the terminal cysteine to<br>
separate the reacting thiol group from the binding sequence.<br>
Additionally, the spacer may be a peptide composed of any amino<br>
acid and mixtures thereof. The preferred peptide spacers are composed<br>
of the amino acids glycine, alanine, and serine, and mixtures thereof. In<br>
addition, the peptide spacer may contain a specific enzyme cleavage site,<br>
such as the protease Caspase 3 site, given by SEQ ID NO:65, which<br>
allows for the enzymatic removal of the conditioning agent from the hair.<br>
The peptide spacer may be from 1 to about 50 amino acids, preferably<br>
from 1 to about 20 amino acids. These peptide spacers may be linked to<br>
the binding peptide sequence by any method known in the art. For<br>
example, the entire binding peptide-peptide spacer diblock may be<br>
prepared using the standard peptide synthesis methods described supra.<br>
In addition, the binding peptide and peptide spacer blocks may be<br>
combined using carbodiimide coupling agents (see for example,<br>
Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, New York<br>
(1996)), diacid chlorides, diisocyanates and other difunctional coupling<br>
reagents that are reactive to terminal amine and/or carboxylic acid terminal<br>
groups on the peptides. Alternatively, the entire binding peptide-peptide<br>
spacer diblock may be prepared using the recombinant DMA and<br>
molecular cloning techniques described supra. The spacer may also be a<br>
combination of a peptide spacer and an organic spacer molecule, which<br>
may be prepared using the methods described above.<br>
It may also be desirable to have multiple hair-binding peptides<br>
coupled to the hair conditioning agent to enhance the interaction between<br>
the peptide-based hair conditioner and the hair. Either multiple copies of<br>
the same hair-binding peptide or a combination of different hair-binding<br>
peptides may be used. In the case of large conditioning particles (e.g.,<br>
particle emulsions), a large number of hair-binding peptides, i.e., up to<br>
about 1,000, may be coupled to the conditioning agent. A smaller number<br>
of hair-binding peptides can be coupled to the smaller conditioner<br>
molecules, i.e., up to about 50. Therefore, in one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the peptide-based hair conditioners are diblock<br>
compositions consisting of a hair-binding peptide (HBP) and a hair<br>
conditioning agent (HCA), having the general structure (HBP)n - HCA,<br>
where n ranges from 1 to about 1,000, preferably from 1 to about 50. In<br>
another embodiment, the peptide-based hair conditioners contain a spacer<br>
(S) separating the hair-binding peptide from the hair conditioning agent, as<br>
described above. Multiple copies of the hair-binding peptide may be<br>
coupled to a single spacer molecule. In this embodiment, the peptidebased<br>
hair conditioners are triblock compositions consisting of a hairbinding<br>
peptide, a spacer, and a hair conditioning agent, having the<br>
general structure [(HBP)m - S]n - HCA, where n ranges from 1 to about<br>
1,000, preferably n is 1 to about 50, and m ranges from 1 to about 50,<br>
preferably m is 1 to about 10.<br>
It should be understood that as used herein, HBP is a generic<br>
designation and is not meant to refer to a single hair binding peptide<br>
sequence. Where n or m as used above, is greater than 1, it is well within<br>
the scope of the invention to provide for the situation where a series of hair<br>
binding peptides of different sequences may form a part of the<br>
composition. Additionally, it should be understood that these structures do<br>
not necessarily represent a covalent bond between the peptide, the hair<br>
conditioning agent, and the optional spacer. As described above, the<br>
coupling interaction between the peptide, the hair conditioning agent, and<br>
the optional spacer may be either covalent or non-covalent.<br>
The peptide-based hair conditioners of the present invention may<br>
be used in compositions for hair care. It should also be recognized that<br>
the hair-binding peptides themselves can serve as conditioning agents for<br>
the treatment of hair. Hair care compositions are herein defined as<br>
compositions for the treatment of hair, including but not limited to<br>
shampoos, conditioners, lotions, aerosols, gels, mousses, and hair dyes<br>
comprising an effective amount of a peptide-based hair conditioner or a<br>
mixture of different peptide-based hair conditioners in a cosmetically<br>
acceptable medium. An effective amount of a peptide-based hair<br>
conditioner or hair-binding peptide for use in a hair care composition is<br>
herein defined as a proportion of from about 0.01% to about 10%,<br>
preferably about 0.01% to about 5% by weight relative to the total weight<br>
of the composition. Components of a cosmetically acceptable medium for<br>
hair care compositions are described by Philippe et al. in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,280,747, and by Omura et al. in U.S. Patent No. 6,139,851 and Cannell<br>
et al. in U.S. Patent No. 6,013,250, all of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. For example, these hair care compositions can be aqueous,<br>
alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic solutions, the alcohol preferably being<br>
ethanol or isopropanol, in a proportion of from about 1 to about 75% by<br>
weight relative to the total weight, for the aqueous-alcoholic solutions.<br>
Additionally, the hair care compositions may contain one or more<br>
conventional cosmetic or dermatological additives or adjuvants including<br>
but not limited to, antioxidants, preserving agents, fillers, surfactants, UVA<br>
and/or UVB sunscreens, fragrances, thickeners, wetting agents and<br>
anionic, nonionic or amphoteric polymers, and dyes or pigments.<br>
Peptide-Based Skin Conditioners<br>
The peptide-based skin conditioners of the present invention are<br>
formed by coupling a skin-binding peptide (SBP) with a skin conditioning<br>
agent (SCA). The skin-binding peptide part of the conditioner binds<br>
strongly to the skin, thus keeping the conditioning agent attached to the<br>
skin for a long lasting conditioning effect. The skin-binding peptides<br>
include, but are not limited to, skin-binding peptides selected by the<br>
screening methods described above, including the skin-binding peptide<br>
sequence of the invention, given as SEQ ID NO:61. Additionally, any<br>
known skin-binding peptide may be used, including but not limited to SEQ<br>
ID NO:2, and SEQ ID NOs:99-104, described by Janssen et al. in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0152976 and by Janssen et al. in<br>
WO 04048399, respectively.<br>
Skin conditioning agents as herein defined include, but are not<br>
limited to astringents, which tighten skin; exfoliants, which remove dead<br>
skin cells; emollients, which help maintain a smooth, soft, pliable<br>
appearance; humectants, which increase the water content of the top layer<br>
of skin; occlusives, which retard evaporation of water from the skin's<br>
surface; and miscellaneous compounds that enhance the appearance of<br>
dry or damaged skin or reduce flaking and restore suppleness . In the<br>
peptide-based skin conditioners of the present invention, any known skin<br>
conditioning agent may be used. Skin conditioning agents are well known<br>
in the art, see for example Green et al. (WO 0107009), and are available<br>
commercially from various sources. Suitable examples of skin<br>
conditioning agents include, but are not limited to, alpha-hydroxy acids,<br>
beta-hydroxy acids, polyols, hyaluronic acid, D,L-panthenol,<br>
polysalicylates, vitamin A palmitate, vitamin E acetate, glycerin, sorbitol,<br>
silicones, silicone derivatives, lanolin, natural oils and triglyceride esters.<br>
The preferred skin conditioning agents of the present invention are<br>
polysalicylates, propylene glycol (CAS No. 57-55-6, Dow Chemical,<br>
Midland, Ml), glycerin (CAS No. 56-81-5, Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.,<br>
Cincinnati, OH), glycolic acid (CAS No. 79-14-1, DuPont Co., Wilmington,<br>
DE), lactic acid (CAS No. 50-21-5, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA), malic acid<br>
(CAS No. 617-48-1, Alfa Aesar), citric acid (CAS No. 77-92-9, Alfa Aesar),<br>
tartaric acid (CAS NO. 133-37-9, Alfa Aesar), glucaric acid (CAS No. 87-<br>
73-0), galactaric acid (CAS No. 526-99-8), 3-hydroxyvaleric acid (CAS No.<br>
10237-77-1), salicylic acid (CAS No. 69-72-7, Alfa Aesar), and 1,3<br>
propanediol (CAS No. 504-63-2, DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE).<br>
Polysalicylates may be prepared by the method described by White et al.<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 4,855,483, incorporated herein by reference. Glucaric<br>
acid may be synthesized using the method described by Merbouh et al.<br>
(Carbohydr. Res. 336:75-78 (2001). The 3-hydroxyvaleric acid may be<br>
prepared as described by Bramucci in WO 02012530.<br>
The peptide-based skin conditioners of the present invention are<br>
prepared by coupling a specific skin-binding peptide to the skin<br>
conditioning agent, either directly or via a spacer. Any of the coupling<br>
methods described above may be used. It may be necessary to introduce<br>
reactive groups, such as carboxylic acid, alcohol, amine, or aldehyde<br>
groups, on the skin conditioning agent for coupling to the hair-binding<br>
peptide, as described above. It may also be desirable to have multiple<br>
skin-binding peptides coupled to the skin conditioning agent to enhance<br>
the interaction between the peptide-based skin conditioner and the skin.<br>
Either multiple copies of the same skin-binding peptide or a combination of<br>
different skin-binding peptides may be used. In the case of large<br>
conditioning particles, a large number of skin-binding peptides, i.e., up to<br>
about 1,000, may be coupled to the conditioning agent. A smaller number<br>
of skin-binding peptides can be attached to the smaller conditioner<br>
molecules, i.e., up to about 50. Therefore, in one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the peptide-based skin conditioners are djblock<br>
compositions consisting of a skin-binding peptide (SBP) and a skin<br>
conditioning agent (SCA), having the general structure (SBP)n - SCA,<br>
where n ranges from 1 to about 1,000, preferably from 1 to about 50. ,<br>
In another embodiment, the peptide-based skin conditioners contain<br>
a spacer (S) separating the skin-binding peptide from the skin conditioning<br>
agent, as described above. Multiple copies of the skin-binding peptide<br>
may be coupled to a single spacer molecule. In this embodiment, the<br>
peptide-based skin conditioners are triblock compositions consisting of a<br>
skin binding peptide, a spacer, and a skin conditioning agent, having the<br>
general structure [(SBP)m - S]n - SCA, where n ranges from 1 to about<br>
1,000, preferably n is 1 to about 50, and m ranges from 1 to about 50,<br>
preferably m is 1 to about 10.<br>
It should be understood that as used herein, SBP is a generic<br>
designation and is not meant to refer to a single skin binding peptide<br>
sequence. Where n or m as used above, is greater than 1, it is well within<br>
the scope of the invention to provide for the situation where a series of<br>
skin binding peptides of different sequences may form a part of the<br>
composition. Additionally, it should be understood that these structures do<br>
not necessarily represent a covalent bond between the peptide, the skin<br>
conditioning agent, and the optional spacer. As described above, the<br>
coupling interaction between the peptide, the skin conditioning agent, and<br>
the optional spacer may be either covalent or non-covalent.<br>
The peptide-based skin conditioners of the present invention may<br>
be used in compositions for skin care. It should also be recognized that<br>
the skin-binding peptides themselves can serve as conditioning agents for<br>
skin. Skin care compositions are herein defined as compositions<br>
comprising an effective amount of a peptide-based skin conditioner or a<br>
mixture of different peptide-based skin conditioners in a cosmetically<br>
acceptable medium. The uses of these compositions include, but are not<br>
limited to, skin care, skin cleansing, make-up, and anti-wrinkle products.<br>
An effective amount of a peptide-based skin conditioner or skin-binding<br>
peptide for skin care compositions is herein defined as a proportion of from<br>
about 0.001% to about 10%, preferably about 0.01% to about 5% by<br>
weight relative to the total weight of the composition. This proportion may<br>
vary as a function of the type of skin care composition. Suitable<br>
compositions for a cosmetically acceptable medium are described by<br>
Philippe et al. supra. For example, the cosmetically acceptable medium<br>
may be an anhydrous composition containing a fatty substance in a<br>
proportion generally of from about 10 to about 90% by weight relative to<br>
the total weight of the composition, where the fatty phase containing at<br>
least one liquid, solid or semi-solid fatty substance. The fatty substance<br>
includes, but is not limited to, oils, waxes, gums, and so-called pasty fatty<br>
substances. Alternatively, the compositions may be in the form of a stable<br>
dispersion such as a water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion. Additionally, the<br>
compositions may contain one or more conventional cosmetic or<br>
dermatological additives or adjuvants, including but not limited to,<br>
antioxidants, preserving agents, fillers, surfactants, UVA and/or UVB<br>
sunscreens, fragrances, thickeners, wetting agents and anionic, nonionic<br>
or amphoteric polymers, and dyes or pigments.<br>
Peptide-Based Hair Colorants<br>
The peptide-based hair colorants of the present invention are<br>
formed by coupling a hair-binding peptide (HBP) with a coloring agent (C).<br>
The hair-binding peptide part of the peptide-based hair colorant binds<br>
strongly to the hair, thus keeping the coloring agent attached to the hair for<br>
a long lasting hair coloring effect. The hair-binding peptides include, but<br>
are not limited to, hair-binding peptides selected by the screening methods<br>
described above, including the hair-binding peptide sequences of the<br>
invention, given by SEQ ID NOs: 3-59, 64, 66, 69 and 70, most preferably<br>
the peptides given by SEQ ID NO:46 and SEQ ID NO:66, which bind<br>
strongly to hair, but not to skin. Additionally, any known hair-binding<br>
peptide may be used, including but not limited to SEQ ID NO:1, and SEQ<br>
ID NOs:76-98, described by Janssen et al. in U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2003/0152976 and by Janssen et al. in WO 04048399,<br>
respectively. For bleached hair, the fingernail-binding peptide, given as<br>
SEQ ID NO:60, may also be used.<br>
Coloring agents as herein defined are any dye, pigment, and the<br>
like that may be used to change the color of hair, skin, or nails. In the<br>
peptide-based hair colorants of the present invention, any known coloring<br>
agent may be used. Hair coloring agents are well known in the art (see for<br>
example Green et al. supra, CFTA International Color Handbook, 2nd ed.,<br>
Micelle Press, England (1992) and Cosmetic Handbook, US Food and<br>
Drug Administration, FDA/IAS Booklet (1992)), and are available<br>
commercially from various sources (for example Bayer, Pittsburgh, PA;<br>
Ciba-Geigy, Tarrytown, NY; ICI, Bridgewater, NJ; Sandoz, Vienna, Austria;<br>
BASF, Mount Olive, NJ; and Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany). Suitable hair<br>
coloring agents include, but are not limited to dyes, such as 4-<br>
hydroxypropylamino-3-nitrophenol, 4-amino-3-nitrophenol, 2-amino-6-<br>
chloro-4-nitrophenol, 2-nitro-paraphenylenediamine, N,N-hydroxyethyl-2-<br>
nitro-phenylenediamine, 4-nitro-indole, Henna, HC Blue 1, HC Blue 2, HC<br>
Yellow 4, HC Red 3, HC Red 5, Disperse Violet 4, Disperse Black 9, HC<br>
Blue 7, HC Blue 12, HC Yellow 2, HC Yellow 6, HC Yellow 8, HC Yellow<br>
12, HC Brown 2, D&amp;C Yellow 1, D&amp;C Yellow 3, D&amp;C Blue 1, Disperse Blue<br>
3, Disperse violet 1, eosin derivatives such as D&amp;C Red No. 21 and<br>
halogenated fluorescein derivatives such as D&amp;C Red No. 27, D&amp;C Red<br>
Orange No. 5 in combination with D&amp;C Red No. 21 and D&amp;C Orange No.<br>
10; and pigments, such as D&amp;C Red No. 36 and D&amp;C Orange No. 17, the<br>
calcium lakes of D&amp;C Red Nos. 7,11, 31 and 34, the barium lake of D&amp;C<br>
Red No. 12, the strontium lake of D&amp;C Red No. 13, the aluminum lakes of<br>
FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, of D&amp;C Red No. 27, of D&amp;C<br>
Red No. 21, and of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, iron oxides, manganese violet,<br>
chromium oxide, titanium dioxide, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, zinc<br>
oxide, barium oxide, ultramarine blue, bismuth citrate, and carbon black<br>
particles. The preferred hair coloring agents of the present invention are<br>
D&amp;C Yellow 1 and 3, HC Yellow 6 and 8, D&amp;C Blue 1, HC Blue 1, HC<br>
Brown 2, HC Red 5, 2-nitro-paraphenylenediamine, N,N-hydroxyethyl-2-<br>
nitro-phenylenediamine, 4-nitro-indo!e, and carbon black.<br>
Metallic and semiconductor nanoparticles may also be used as hair<br>
coloring agents due to their strong emission of light (Vic et al. U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2004/0010864). The metallic nanoparticles<br>
include, but are not limited to, particles of gold, silver, platinum, palladium,<br>
iridium, rhodium, osmium, iron, copper, cobalt, and alloys composed of<br>
these metals. An "alloy" is herein defined as a homogeneous mixture of<br>
two or more metals. The "semiconductor nanoparticles" include, but are<br>
not limited to, particles of cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide, silver<br>
sulfide, cadmium sulfide, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc selenide, lead<br>
sulfide, gallium arsenide, silicon, tin oxide, iron oxide, and indium<br>
phosphide. The nanoparticles are stabilized and made water-soluble by<br>
the use of a suitable organic coating or monolayer. As used herein,<br>
monolayer-protected nanoparticles are one type of stabilized nanoparticle.<br>
Methods for the preparation of stabilized, water-soluble metal and<br>
semiconductor nanoparticles are known in the art, and are described by<br>
Huang et al. in copending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/622889, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. The color of the nanoparticles depends<br>
on the size of the particles. Therefore, by controlling the size of the<br>
nanoparticles, different colors may be obtained. For example, ZnS-coated<br>
CdSe nanoparticles cover the entire visible spectrum over a particle size<br>
range of 2 to 6 nm. Specifically, CdSe nanoparticles with a core size of<br>
2.3, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.5 nm emit light at the wavelength centered around 485,<br>
565, 590, and 625 nm, respectively. Water-soluble nanoparticles of<br>
different sizes may be obtained from a broad size distribution of<br>
nanoparticles using the size fractionation method described by Huang,<br>
supra. That method comprises the regulated addition of a water-miscible<br>
organic solvent to a solution of nanoparticles in the presence of an<br>
electrolyte. Increasing additions of the water-miscible organic solvent<br>
result in the precipitation of nanoparticles of decreasing size. The metallic<br>
and semiconductor nanoparticles may also serve as volumizing agents, as<br>
-scribed above.<br>
Of particular utility are titanium dioxide nanoparticles that not only<br>
serve as a colorant but additionally may serve to block harmful UV<br>
radiation. Suitable titanium dioxide nanoparticles are described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,451,390; 5,672,330; and 5,762,914. Titanium dioxide P25<br>
is an example of a suitable commercial product available from Degussa.<br>
Other commercial suppliers of titanium dioxide nanoparticles include<br>
Kemira, Sachtleben and Tayca. •»<br>
The titanium dioxide nanoparticles typically have an average<br>
particle size diameter of less than 100 nanometers (nm) as determined by<br>
dynamic light scattering which measures the particle size distribution of<br>
particles in liquid suspension. The particles are typically agglomerates<br>
which may range from about 3 nm to about 6000 nm. Any process known<br>
in the art can be used to prepare such particles. The process may involve<br>
vapor phase oxidation of titanium halides or solution precipitation from<br>
soluble titanium complexes, provided that titanium dioxide nanoparticles<br>
are produced.<br>
A preferred process to prepare titanium dioxide nanoparticles is by<br>
injecting oxygen and titanium halide, preferably titanium tetrachloride, into<br>
a high-temperature reaction zone, typically ranging from 400 to 2000<br>
degrees centrigrade. Under the high temperature conditions present in<br>
the reaction zone, nanoparticles of titanium dioxide are formed having high<br>
surface area and a narrow size distribution. The energy source in the<br>
reactor may be any heating source such as a plasma torch.<br>
Additionally, the coloring agent may be a colored, polymeric<br>
microsphere. Exemplary polymeric microspheres include, but are not<br>
limited to, microspheres of polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate,<br>
polyvinyltoluene, styrene/butadiene copolymer, and latex. For use in the<br>
invention, the microspheres have a diameter of about 10 nanometers to<br>
about 2 microns. The microspheres may be colored by coupling any<br>
suitable dye, such as those described above, to the microspheres. The<br>
dyes may be coupled to the surface of the microsphere or adsorbed within<br>
the porous structure of a porous microsphere. Suitable microspheres,<br>
including undyed and dyed microspheres that are functionalized to enable<br>
covalent attachment, are available from companies such as Bang<br>
Laboratories (Fishers, IN).<br>
The peptide-based hair colorants of the present invention are<br>
prepared by coupling a specific hair-binding peptide to a coloring agent,<br>
either directly or via a spacer. Any of the coupling methods described<br>
above may be used. It may be necessary to introduce reactive groups,<br>
such as carboxylic acid, alcohol, amine, or aldehyde groups, on the<br>
coloring agent for coupling to the hair-binding peptide. These<br>
modifications may be done using routine chemistry, which is well known in<br>
the art. For example, the surface of carbon black particles may be<br>
oxidized using nitric acid, a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide, or an<br>
inorganic initiator such as ammonium persulfate, to generate functional<br>
groups. Preferably, the carbon black surface is oxidized using ammonium<br>
persulfate as described by Carrasco-Marin et al. (J. Chem. Soc., Faraday<br>
Trans. 93:2211-2215 (1997)). Amino functional groups may be introduced<br>
to the surface of carbon black using an organic initiator such as 2,2'-<br>
Azobis(2-methylpropionamide)-dihydrochloride. The inorganic pigments<br>
and the nanoparticles may be derivatized to introduce carboxylic acid or<br>
amino functional groups in a similar manner.<br>
Additionally, the hair-binding peptide may be coupled to a pigment<br>
using a pigment-binding peptide. Suitable pigment-binding peptide<br>
sequences are known in the art. For example, Nomoto et al. in<br>
EP1275728 describe peptides that bind to carbon black, copper<br>
phthalocyanine, titanium dioxide, and silicon dioxide. O'Brien et al. in<br>
copending and commonly owned U.S. Patent Application No. 10/935254<br>
describe peptides that bind to carbon black, Cromophtal® Yellow,<br>
Sunfast® Magenta, and Sunfast® Blue. Additional pigment-binding<br>
peptides may be identified using the any of the screening methods<br>
described above. The pigment-binding peptide may be coupled to the<br>
hair-binding peptide either directly or through a spacer using any of the<br>
coupling methods described above. The hair-binding peptide-pigment<br>
binding peptide diblock or triblock (if a spacer is used) is contacted with<br>
the pigment to attach it to the pigment-binding peptide.<br>
It may also be desirable to have multiple hair-binding peptides<br>
coupled to the coloring agent to enhance the interaction between the<br>
peptide-based hair colorant and the hair. Either multiple copies of the<br>
same hair-binding peptide or a combination of different hair-binding<br>
peptides may be used. In the case of large pigment particles, a large<br>
number of hair-binding peptides, i.e., up to about 10,000, may be coupled<br>
to the pigment. A smaller number of hair-binding peptides can be coupled<br>
to the smaller dye molecules, i.e., up to about 50. Therefore, in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the peptide-based hair colorants are<br>
diblock compositions consisting of a hair-binding peptide (HBP) and a<br>
coloring agent (C), having the general structure (HBP)n - C, where n<br>
ranges from 1 to about 10,000, preferably n is 1 to about 500.<br>
In another embodiment, the peptide-based hair colorants contain a<br>
spacer (S) separating the binding peptide from the hair coloring agent, as<br>
described above. Multiple copies of the hair-binding peptide may be<br>
coupled to a single spacer molecule. In this embodiment, the peptidebased<br>
hair colorants are triblock compositions consisting of a hair-binding<br>
peptide, a spacer, and a coloring agent, having the general structure<br>
[(HBP)m - S]n - C, where n ranges from 1 to about 10,000 , preferably n is<br>
1 to about 500, and m ranges from 1 to about 50, preferably m is 1 to<br>
about 10.<br>
It should be understood that as used herein, HBP is a generic<br>
designation and is not meant to refer to a single hair binding peptide<br>
sequence. Where n or m as used above, is greater than 1, it is well within<br>
the scope of the invention to provide for the situation where a series of hair<br>
binding peptides of different sequences may form a part of the<br>
composition. Additionally, it should be understood that these structures do<br>
not necessarily represent a covalent bond between the peptide, the<br>
coloring agent, and the optional spacer. As described above, the coupling<br>
interaction between the peptide, the coloring agent, and the optional<br>
spacer may be either covalent or non-covalent.<br>
The peptide-based hair colorants of the present invention may be<br>
used in hair coloring compositions for dyeing hair. Hair coloring<br>
compositions are herein defined as compositions for the coloring, dyeing,<br>
or bleaching of hair, comprising an effective amount of peptide-based hair<br>
colorant or a mixture of different peptide-based hair colorants in a<br>
cosmetically acceptable medium. An effective amount of a peptide-based<br>
hair colorant for use in a hair coloring composition is herein defined as a<br>
proportion of from about 0.001 % to about 20% by weight relative to the<br>
total weight of the composition. Components of a cosmetically acceptable<br>
medium for hair coloring compositions are described by Dias et a!., in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,398,821 and by Deutz et al., in U.S. Patent No. 6,129,770,<br>
both of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, hair<br>
coloring compositions may contain sequestrants, stabilizers, thickeners,<br>
buffers, carriers, surfactants, solvents, antioxidants, polymers, and<br>
conditioners. The conditioners may include the peptide-based hair<br>
conditioners and hair-binding peptides of the present invention in a<br>
proportion from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably about 0.01% to<br>
about 5% by weight relative to the total weight of the hair coloring<br>
composition.<br>
The peptide-based hair colorants of the present invention may also<br>
be used as coloring agents in cosmetic compositions that are applied to<br>
the eyelashes or eyebrows including, but not limited to mascaras, and<br>
eyebrow pencils. These may be anhydrous make-up products comprising<br>
a cosmetically acceptable medium which contains a fatty substance in a<br>
proportion generally of from about 10 to about 90% by weight relative to<br>
the total weight of the composition, where the fatty phase containing at<br>
least one liquid, solid or semi-solid fatty substance, as described above.<br>
The fatty substance includes, but is not limited to, oils, waxes, gums, and<br>
so-called pasty fatty substances. Alternatively, these compositions may<br>
be in the form of a stable dispersion such as a water-in-oil or oil-in-water<br>
emulsion, as described above. In these compositions, the proportion of<br>
the peptide-based hair colorant is generally from about 0.001% to about<br>
20% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>
Peptide-Based Nail Colorants<br>
The peptide-based nail colorants of the present invention are<br>
formed by coupling a nail-binding peptide (NBP) with a coloring agent (C).<br>
The nail-binding peptide part of the peptide-based nail colorant binds<br>
strongly to the fingernails or toenails, thus keeping the coloring agent<br>
attached to the nails for a long lasting coloring effect. The nail-binding<br>
peptides include, but are not limited to nail-binding peptides selected by<br>
the screening methods described above, including the nail-binding peptide<br>
sequences of the invention, given by SEQ ID NOs:53 and 60, most<br>
preferably the peptide given by SEQ ID NO:60. Additionally, the beached<br>
hair-binding peptides, given as SEQ ID NOs:7, 8,19-27 38, 39, 40, 43-45,<br>
47, 57,58. and 59 may be used.<br>
The peptide-based nail colorants of the present invention are<br>
prepared by coupling a specific nail-binding peptide to a coloring agent,<br>
either directly or via a spacer, using any of the coupling methods<br>
described above. In the peptide-based nail colorants of the present<br>
invention, any of the coloring agents described above may be used. The<br>
preferred coloring agents for use in the peptide-based nail colorants of the<br>
present invention include D&amp;C Red Nos. 8,10, 30 and 36, the barium<br>
lakes of D&amp;C Red Nos. 6, 9 and 12, the calcium lakes of D&amp;C Red Nos. 7,<br>
11,31 and 34, the strontium lake of D&amp;C Red No. 30 and D&amp;C Orange<br>
No. 17 and D&amp;C Blue No. 6.<br>
It may also be desirable to have multiple nail-binding peptides<br>
coupled to the coloring agent to enhance the interaction between the<br>
peptide-based nail colorant and the nails. Either multiple copies of the<br>
same nail-binding peptide or a combination of different nail-binding<br>
peptides may be used. In the case of large pigment particles, a large<br>
number of nail-binding peptides, i.e., up to about 10,000, may be coupled<br>
to the pigment. A smaller number of nail-binding peptides can be coupled<br>
to the smaller dye molecules, i.e., up to about 50. Therefore, in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the peptide-based nail colorants are<br>
diblock compositions consisting of a nail-binding peptide (NBP) and a<br>
coloring agent (C), having the general structure (NBP)n - C, where n<br>
ranges from 1 to about 10,000, preferably n is 1 to about 500.<br>
In another embodiment, the peptide-based nail colorants contain a<br>
spacer (S) separating the binding peptide from the coloring agent, as<br>
described above. Multiple copies of the nail-binding peptide may be<br>
coupled to a single spacer molecule. In this embodiment, the peptidebased<br>
nail colorants are triblock compositions consisting of a nail-binding<br>
peptide, a spacer, and a coloring agent, having the genera! structure<br>
[(NBP)m - S]n - C, where n ranges from 1 to about 10,000, preferably n is<br>
1 to about 500, and m ranges from 1 to about 50, preferably m is 1 to<br>
about 10.<br>
It should be understood that as used herein, NBP is a generic<br>
designation and is not meant to refer to a single nail binding peptide<br>
sequence. Where n or m as used above, is greater than 1, it is well within<br>
the scope of the invention to provide for the situation where a series of nail<br>
binding peptides of different sequences may form a part of the<br>
composition. Additionally, it should be understood that these structures do<br>
not necessarily represent a covalent bond between the peptide, the<br>
coloring agent, and the optional spacer. As described above, the coupling<br>
interaction between the peptide, the coloring agent, and the optional<br>
spacer may be either covalent or non-covalent.<br>
The peptide-based nail colorants of the present invention may be<br>
used in nail polish compositions for coloring fingernails and toenails.<br>
Nail polish compositions are herein defined as compositions for the<br>
treatment and coloring of nails, comprising an effective amount of a<br>
peptide-based nail colorant or a mixture of different peptide-based nail<br>
colorants in a cosmetically acceptable medium. An effective amount of a<br>
peptide-based nail colorant for use in a nail polish composition is herein<br>
defined as a proportion of from about 0.001% to about 20% by weight<br>
relative to the total weight of the composition. Components of a<br>
cosmetically acceptable medium for nail polishes are described by<br>
Philippe et al. supra. The nail polish composition typically contains a<br>
solvent and a film forming substance, such as cellulose derivatives,<br>
polyvinyl derivatives, acrylic polymers or copolymers, vinyl copolymers and<br>
polyester polymers. Additionally, the nail polish may contain a plasticizer,<br>
such as tricresyl phosphate, benzyl benzoate, tributyl phosphate, butyl<br>
acetyl ricinoleate, triethyl citrate, tributyl acetyl citrate, dibutyl phthalate or<br>
camphor.<br>
Peptide-Based Skin Colorants<br>
The peptide-based skin colorants of the present invention are<br>
formed by coupling a skin-binding peptide (SBP) with a coloring agent (C).<br>
The skin-binding peptide part of the peptide-based skin colorant binds<br>
strongly to the skin, thus keeping the coloring agent attached to the skin<br>
for a long lasting skin coloring effect. The skin-binding peptides include,<br>
but are not limited to, skin-binding peptides selected by the screening<br>
methods described above, including the skin-binding peptide sequence of<br>
the invention, given as SEQ ID NOs:61. Additionally, any known skinbinding<br>
peptide may be used, including but not limited to SEQ ID NO:2,<br>
and SEQ ID NOs:99-104, described by Janssen et al. in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2003/0152976 and by Janssen et al. in WO<br>
04048399, respectively.<br>
The peptide-based skin colorants of the present invention are<br>
prepared by coupling a specific skin-binding peptide to a coloring agent,<br>
either directly or via a spacer, using any of the coupling methods<br>
described above. Any of the colorants described above may be used.<br>
The preferred coloring agents for use in the peptide-based skin colorants<br>
of the present invention include the following dyes: eosin derivatives such<br>
as D&amp;C Red No. 21 and halogenated fluorescein derivatives such as D&amp;C<br>
Red No. 27, D&amp;C Red Orange No. 5 in combination with D&amp;C Red No. 21<br>
and D&amp;C Orange No. 10, and the pigments: titanium dioxide, titanium<br>
dioxide nanoparticles, zinc oxide, D&amp;C Red No. 36 and D&amp;C Orange No.<br>
17, the calcium lakes of D&amp;C Red Nos. 7,11, 31 and 34, the barium lake<br>
of D&amp;C Red No. 12, the strontium lake D&amp;C Red No. 13, .the aluminum<br>
lakes of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, of D&amp;C Red No. 27,<br>
of D&amp;C Red No. 21, of FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, iron oxides, manganese violet,<br>
chromium oxide, ultramarine blue, and carbon black. The coloring agent<br>
may also be a sunless tanning agent, such as dihydroxyacetone, that<br>
produces a tanned appearance on the skin without exposure to the sun.<br>
It may also be desirable to have multiple skin-binding peptides<br>
coupled to the coloring agent to enhance the interaction between the<br>
peptide-based skin colorant and the skin. Either multiple copies of the<br>
same skin-binding peptide or a combination of different skin-binding<br>
peptides may be used. In the case of large pigment particles, a large<br>
number of skin-binding peptides, i.e., up to about 10,000, may be coupled<br>
to the pigment. A smaller number of skin-binding peptides can be coupled<br>
to the smaller dye molecules, i.e., up to about 50. Therefore, in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the peptide-based skin colorants are<br>
;<br>
diblock compositions consisting of a skin-binding peptide (SBP) and a<br>
coloring agent (C), having the general structure (SBP)n - C, where n<br>
ranges from 1 to about 10,000, preferably n is 1 to about 500.<br>
In another embodiment, the peptide-based skin colorants contain a<br>
spacer (S) separating the binding peptide from the coloring agent, as<br>
described above. Multiple copies of the skin-binding peptide may be<br>
coupled to a single spacer molecule. In this embodiment, the peptidebased<br>
skin colorants are triblock compositions consisting of a skin-binding<br>
peptide, a spacer, and a coloring agent, having the general structure<br>
 [(SBP)m - S]n - C, where n ranges from 1 to about 10,000, preferably n is<br>
1 to about 500, and m ranges from 1 to about 50, preferably m is 1 to<br>
about 10.<br>
It should be understood that as used herein, SBP is a generic<br>
designation and is not meant to refer to a single skin binding peptide<br>
sequence. Where n or m as used above, is greater than 1, it is well within<br>
the scope of the invention to provide for the situation where a series of<br>
skin binding peptides of different sequences may form a part of the<br>
composition. Additionally, It should be understood that these structures do<br>
not necessarily represent a covalent bond between the peptide, the<br>
coloring agent, and the optional spacer. As described above, the coupling<br>
interaction between the peptide, the coloring agent, and the optional<br>
spacer may be either covalent or non-covalent.<br>
The peptide-based skin colorants of the present invention may be<br>
used as coloring agents in cosmetic and make-up products, including but<br>
not limited to foundations, blushes, lipsticks, lip liners, lip glosses,<br>
eyeshadows and eyeliners. These may be anhydrous make-up products<br>
comprising a cosmetically acceptable medium which contains a fatty<br>
substance, or they may be in the form of a stable dispersion such as a<br>
water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion, as described above. In these<br>
compositions, the proportion of the peptide-based skin colorant is<br>
generally from about 0.001 % to about 40% by weight relative to the total<br>
weight of the composition.<br>
Peptide-Based Oral Care Reagents<br>
The peptide-based oral care reagents of the invention are formed<br>
by coupling an oral cavity surface-binding peptide (OBP) with an oral care<br>
benefit agent (OBA). Oral cavity surface-binding peptides include, but are<br>
not limited to, tooth-binding peptides (TBP), skin-binding peptides (SBP),<br>
gum, cheek, and tongue-binding peptides. The peptide part of the<br>
peptide-based oral care agent binds strongly to the teeth, gums, cheeks,<br>
tongue, or other surface in the oral cavity, thus keeping the benefit agent<br>
attached for a long lasting effect. The skin-binding peptides described<br>
above may be useful for attachment to gums, cheeks, or tongue.<br>
Preferably, a binding peptiae ror me specific oral cavity surface of interest<br>
is identified using the screening methods described above. .<br>
The peptide-based oral care reagents of the invention are prepared<br>
by coupling an oral cavity surface-binding peptide to an oral care benefit<br>
agent, either directly or via a spacer, using any of the coupling methods<br>
described above. Oral care benefit agents are well known in the art (see<br>
for example White etal., U.S. Patent No. 6,740,311; Lawleret al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,706,256; and Fuglsang et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,264925; all<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference). Exemplary oral benefit<br>
agents include, but are not limited to, white colorants, whitening agents,<br>
enzymes, anti-plaque agents, anti-staining agents, anti-microbial agents,<br>
anti-caries agents, flavoring agents, coolants, and salivating agents.<br>
Suitable white colorants which may be used in peptide-based teeth<br>
whiteners include, but are not limited to, white pigments such as titanium<br>
dioxide, titanium dioxide nanoparticles ; and white minerals such as<br>
hydroxyapatite, and Zircon (zirconium silicate). Suitable enzymes may be<br>
naturally occurring or recombinant enzymes including, but not limited to,<br>
oxidases, peroxidases, proteases, lipases, glycosidases, esterases, and<br>
polysaccharide hydrolases. Anti-plaque agents include, but are not limited<br>
to, fluoride ion sources and anti-microbial agents. Suitable anti-microbial<br>
agents include, but are not limited to, anti-microbial peptides such as those<br>
described by Haynie in U.S. Patent No. 5,847,047, magainins, and<br>
cecropins; microbiocides such as triclosan, chlorhexidine, quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds, chloroxyylenol, chloroxyethanol, phthalic acid and<br>
its salts, and thymol. Suitable flavoring agents include, but are not limited<br>
to, oil of wintergreen, oil of peppermint, oil of spearmint, menthol, methyl<br>
salicylate, eucalyptol, and vanillin.<br>
It may also be desirable to have multiple oral cavity surface-binding<br>
peptides coupled to the oral benefit agent to enhance the interaction<br>
between the peptide-based oral care agent and the oral cavity surface.<br>
Either multiple copies of the same oral cavity surface-binding peptide or a<br>
combination of different oral cavity surface-binding peptides may be used.<br>
In the case of large pigment particles, a large number of oral cavity<br>
surface-binding peptides, i.e., up to about 10,000, may be coupled to the<br>
pigment. A smaller number of oral cavity surface-binding peptides can be<br>
coupled to the smaller oral benefit agents molecules, i.e., up to about 50.<br>
Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention, the peptide-based<br>
oral care reagents are diblock compositions consisting of an oral cavity<br>
surface-binding peptide (OBP) and an oral benefit agent (OBA), having the<br>
general structure (OBP)n - OBA, where n ranges from 1 to about 10,000,<br>
preferably n is 1 to about 500.<br>
In another embodiment, the peptide-based oral care reagents<br>
contain a spacer (S) separating the binding peptide from the oral benefit<br>
agent, as described above. Multiple copies of the oral cavity surfacebinding<br>
peptide may be coupled to a single spacer molecule. In this<br>
embodiment, the peptide-based oral care reagents are triblock<br>
compositions consisting of an oral cavity surface-binding peptide, a<br>
spacer, and an oral benefit agent, having the general structure [(OBP)m -<br>
S]n - OBA, where n ranges from 1 to about 10,000, preferably n is 1 to<br>
about 500, and m ranges from 1 to about 50, preferably m is 1 to about 10.<br>
It should be understood that as used herein, OBP is a generic<br>
designation and is not meant to refer to a single oral cavity surface-binding<br>
peptide sequence. Where n or m as used above, is greater than 1, it is<br>
well within the scope of the invention to provide for the situation where a<br>
series of oral cavity surface-binding peptides of different sequences may<br>
form a part of the composition. Additionally, it should be understood that<br>
these structures do not necessarily represent a covalent bond between the<br>
peptide, the oral benefit agent, and the optional spacer. As described<br>
above, the coupling interaction between the peptide, the oral benefit<br>
agent, and the optional spacer may be either covalent or non-covalent.<br>
The peptide-based oral care reagents of the invention may be used<br>
in oral care products, which may have any suitable physical form, such as<br>
powder, paste, gel, liquid, ointment, or tablet. Exemplary oral care<br>
products include, but are not limited to, toothpaste, dental cream, gel or<br>
tooth powder, mouth wash, breath freshener, and dental floss. The oral<br>
care products comprise an effective amount of the peptide-based oral care<br>
reagents of the invention in an orally acceptable carrier medium. An<br>
effective amount of a peptide-based oral care agent for use in an oral care<br>
product may vary depending on the type of product. Typically, the<br>
effective amount of the peptide-based oral care agent is a proportion from<br>
about 0.001% to about 90% by weight of the total product composition.<br>
The oral care product may contain one type of peptide-based oral care<br>
agent or a mixture of different peptide-based oral care reagents.<br>
Components of an orally acceptable carrier medium are described<br>
by White et al., Lawler et al., and Fuglsang et al., supra. For example, in<br>
addition to the peptide-based oral care reagents of the invention, the oral<br>
care products may contain one or more of the following: abrasives,<br>
surfactants, chelating agents, fluoride sources, thickening agents,<br>
buffering agents, solvents, humectants, carriers, bulking agents, and<br>
additional oral benefit agents, as given above.<br>
The oral care products of the invention may be prepared using<br>
standard techniques that are well known in the art. If the composition<br>
comprises more than one phase, typically, the different phases are<br>
prepared separately, with material of similar phase partitioning being'<br>
added in any order. The two phases are combined using vigorous mixing<br>
to form the multiphase system (e.g., an emulsion or dispersion).<br>
Methods for Treating Hair. Skin. Nails, and the Oral Cavity<br>
In another embodiment, methods are provided for treating hair,<br>
skin, and nails, with the peptide-based conditioners and colorants of the<br>
present invention. Specifically, the present invention also comprises a<br>
method for forming a protective film of peptide-based conditioner on skin,<br>
hair, or lips by applying one of the compositions described above<br>
comprising an effective amount of a peptide-based skin conditioner or<br>
peptide-based hair conditioner to the skin, hair, or lips and allowing the<br>
formation of the protective film. The compositions of the present invention<br>
may be applied to the skin, hair, or lips by various means, including, but<br>
not limited to spraying, brushing, and applying by hand. The peptidebased<br>
conditioner composition is left in contact with the skin, hair, or lips<br>
for a period of time sufficient to form the protective film, preferably for at<br>
least about 0.1 to 60 min.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for coloring hair by<br>
applying a hair coloring composition comprising an effective amount of a<br>
peptide-based hair colorant to the hair by means described above. The<br>
hair coloring composition is allowed to contact the hair for a period of time<br>
sufficient to cause coloration of the hair, preferably between about 5<br>
seconds to about 50 minutes, and more preferably from about 5 seconds<br>
to about 60 seconds, and then the hair coloring composition may be rinsed<br>
from the hair.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for coloring skin or<br>
lips by applying a skin coloring composition comprising an effective<br>
amount of a peptide-based skin colorant to the skin or lips by means<br>
described above.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for coloring<br>
fingernails or toenails by applying a nail polish composition comprising an<br>
•»<br>
effective amount of a peptide-based nail colorant to the fingernails or<br>
toenails by means described above.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for coloring eyebrows<br>
and. eyelashes by applying a cosmetic composition comprising an effective<br>
amount of a peptide-based hair colorant to the eyebrows and eyelashes<br>
by means described above.<br>
The invention also provides a method for whitening teeth by<br>
applying an oral care product composition comprising a peptide-based<br>
whitener to the teeth for a sufficient time to allow the peptide-based<br>
whitener to bind to the teeth. The composition may then be rinsed from<br>
the teeth. The oral care product composition may be applied to the teeth<br>
using any suitable method including, but not limited to, brushing, rinsing,<br>
and using an applicator strip or dental floss coated with the composition.<br>
The invention also provides a method for freshening breath by<br>
applying to the oral cavity an oral care product comprising a peptide-based<br>
breath freshener. The oral care product may be applied as a rinse, a<br>
toothpaste, a spray, a gum, or a candy.<br>
The above methods of application of the binding reagents to body<br>
surfaces are characterized by the ability of the regent to bind to a surface<br>
in an aqueous environment and to bind rapidly, often within 5 to about 60<br>
seconds from the time of first application. The reagents of the invention<br>
are multifaceted bio-adhesives with a multiplicity of applications but unified<br>
in their water fast nature and rapid and tight binding characteristics.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Selection of Hair-Binding Phaqe Peptides Using Standard Biopanning<br>
The purpose of this Example was to identify hair-binding phage<br>
peptides that bind to normal hair and to bleached hair using standard<br>
phage display biopanning.<br>
Phage Display Peptide Libraries:<br>
The phage libraries used in the present invention, Ph.D.-12™<br>
Phage Display Peptide Library Kit and Ph.D.-7™ Phage Display Library<br>
Kit, were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). These kits<br>
are based on a combinatorial library of random peptide 7 or 12-mers fused<br>
to a minor coat protein (pill) of M13 phage. The displayed peptide is<br>
expressed at the N-terminus of pill, such that after the signal peptide is<br>
cleaved, the first residue of the coat protein is the first residue of the<br>
displayed peptide. The Ph.D.-7 and Ph.D.-12 libraries consist of<br>
approximately 2.8 x 10 and 2.7 x 10 sequences, respectively. A volume<br>
of 10 pL contains about 55 copies of each peptide sequence. Each initial<br>
round of experiments was carried out using the original library provided by<br>
the manufacturer in order to avoid introducing any bias into the results.<br>
Preparation of Hair Samples:<br>
The samples used as normal hair were 6-inch medium brown<br>
human hairs obtained from International Hair Importers and Products ,<br>
(Bellerose, NY). The hairs were placed in 90% isopropanol for 30 min at<br>
room temperature and then washed 5 times for 10 min each with<br>
deionized water. The hairs were air-dried overnight at room temperature.<br>
To prepare the bleached hair samples, the medium brown human<br>
hairs were placed in 6% H2O2, which was adjusted to pH 10.2 with<br>
ammonium hydroxide, for 10 min at room temperature and then washed 5<br>
times for 10 min each with deionized water. The hairs were air-dried<br>
overnight at room temperature.<br>
The normal and bleached hair samples were cut into 0.5 to 1 cm<br>
lengths and about 5 to 10 mg of the hairs was placed into wells of a<br>
custom 24-well biopanning apparatus that had a pig skin bottom. An equal<br>
number of the pig skin bottom wells were left empty. The pig skin bottom<br>
apparatus was used as a subtractive procedure to remove phage-peptides<br>
that have an affinity for skin. This apparatus was created by modifying a<br>
dot blot apparatus (obtained from Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Keene, NH) to fit<br>
the biopanning process. Specifically, the top 96-well block of the dot blot<br>
apparatus was replaced by a 24-well block. A 4 x 6 inch treated pig skin<br>
was placed under the 24-well block and panning wells with a pig skin<br>
bottom were formed by tightening the apparatus. The pig skin was<br>
purchased from a local supermarket and stored at -80 °C. Before use, the<br>
skin was placed in deionized water to thaw, and then blotted dry using a<br>
paper towel. The surface of the skin was wiped with 90% isopropanol, and<br>
then rinsed with deionized water. The 24-well apparatus was filled with<br>
blocking buffer consisting of 1 mg/mL BSA in TBST containing 0.5%<br>
Tween® 20 (TBST-0.5%) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The wells and<br>
hairs were washed 5 times with TBST-0.5%. One milliliter of TBST-0.5%<br>
containing 1 mg/mL BSA was added to each well. Then, 10 uL of the<br>
original phage library (2 x 1011 pfu), either the 12-mer or 7-mer library, was<br>
added to the pig skin bottom wells that did not contain a hair sample and<br>
the phage library was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The<br>
unbound phages were then transferred to pig skin bottom wells containing<br>
the hair samples and were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The<br>
hair samples and the wells were washed 10 times with TBST-0.5%. ~Trje<br>
hairs were then transferred to clean, plastic bottom wells of a 24-well plate<br>
and 1 mL of a non-specific elution buffer consisting of 1 mg/mL BSA in 0.2<br>
M glycine-HCI, pH 2.2, was added to each well and incubated for 10 min to<br>
elute the bound phages. Then, 160 uL of neutralization buffer consisting<br>
of 1 M Tris-HCI, pH 9.2, was added to each well. The eluted phages from<br>
each well were transferred to a new tube for titering and sequencing.<br>
To titer the bound phages, the eluted phage was diluted with SM<br>
buffer (100 mM NaCI, 12.3 mM MgS04-7 H2O, 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5,<br>
and 0.01 wt/vol % gelatin) to prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of 101 to 104.<br>
A 10 uL aliquot of each dilution was incubated with 200 uL of mid-log<br>
phase £ coli ER2738 (New England BioLabs), grown in LB medium for 20<br>
min and then mixed with 3 mL of agarose top (LB medium with 5 mM<br>
MgCb, and 0.7% agarose) at 45 °C. This mixture was spread onto a SGal<br>
™/LB agar plate (Sigma Chemical Co.) and incubated overnight at 37<br>
°C. The S-Gal™/LB agar blend contained 5 g of tryptone, 2.5 g of yeast<br>
extract, 5 g of sodium chloride, 6 g of agar, 150 mg of 3,4-<br>
cyclohexenoesculetin-p-D-galactopyranoside (S-Gal™), 250 mg of ferric<br>
ammonium citrate and 15 mg of isopropyl p-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) in<br>
500 ml of distilled water. The plates were prepared by autoclaving the SGal<br>
™ /LB for 15 to 20 min at 121-124 °C. The single black plaques were<br>
randomly picked for DNA isolation and sequence analysis.<br>
The remaining eluted phages were amplified by incubating with<br>
diluted Eco// ER2738, from an overnight culture diluted 1:100 in LB<br>
medium, at 37 °C for 4.5 h. After this time, the cell culture was centrifuged<br>
for 30 s and the upper 80% of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh<br>
tube, 1/6 volume of PEG/NaCI (20% polyethylene glyco-800, 2.5 M sodium<br>
chloride) was added, and the phage was allowed to precipitate overnight<br>
at 4 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 x g at 4<br>
°C and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml_ of TBS. This was the<br>
first round of amplified stock. The amplified first round phage stock was<br>
then titered according to the same method as described above. For the<br>
next round of biopanning, more than 2 x1011 pfu of phage stock from the<br>
first round was used. The biopanning process was repeated for 3 to 6<br>
rounds depending on the experiments.<br>
The single plaque lysates were prepared following the<br>
manufacture's instructions (New England Biolabs) and the single stranded<br>
phage genomic DNA was purified using the QIAprep Spin M13 Kit<br>
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced at the DuPont Sequencing Facility<br>
using -96 gill sequencing primer (5'-CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG-3')t<br>
given as SEQ ID NO:62. The displayed peptide is located immediately<br>
after the signal peptide of gene III.<br>
The amino acid sequences of the eluted normal hair-binding phage<br>
peptides from the 12-mer library isolated from the fifth round of biopanning<br>
are given in Table 1. The amino acid sequences of the eluted bleached<br>
hair-binding phage peptides from the 12-mer library isolated from the fifth<br>
round of biopanning are given in Table 2. Repeated amino acid<br>
sequences of the eluted normal hair-binding phage peptides from the 7-<br>
mer library from 95 randomly selected clones, isolated from the third round<br>
of biopanning, are given in Table 3.<br>
(Table Removed)There was a multiple DNA fragment intersion in these clones.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Selection of High Affinity Hair-Binding Phaqe Peptides<br>
Using a Modified Method<br>
The purpose of this Example was to identify hair-binding phage<br>
peptides with a higher binding affinity.<br>
The hairs that were treated with the acidic elution buffer, as<br>
described in Example 1, were washed three more times with the elution<br>
buffer and then washed three times with TBST-0.5%. These hairs, which<br>
had acid resistant phage peptides still attached, were used to directly<br>
infect 500 uL of mid-log phase bacterial host cells, E. coli ER2738 (New<br>
England BioLabs), which were then grown in LB medium for 20 min and<br>
then mixed with 3 mL of agarose top (LB medium with 5 mM MgCI2, and<br>
0.7% agarose) at 45 °C. This mixture was spread onto a LB<br>
medium/IPTG/ S-Gal™ plate (LB medium with 15 g/L agar, 0.05 g/L IPTG,<br>
and 0.04 g/L S-Gal™) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The black<br>
plaques were counted to calculate the phage titer. The single black<br>
plaques were randomly picked for DNA isolation and sequencing analysis,<br>
as described in Example 1. This process was performed on the normal<br>
and bleached hair samples that were screened with the 7-mer and 12-mer<br>
phage display libraries, as described in Example 1. The amino acid<br>
sequences of these high affinity, hair-binding phage peptides are given in<br>
Selection of Hiqh Affinity Fingernail-Binding Phaqe Peptides<br>
The purpose of this Example was to identify phage peptides that<br>
have a high binding affinity to fingernails. The modified biopanning<br>
method described in Example 2 was used to identify high affinity,<br>
fingernail-binding phage-peptide clones.<br>
67<br>
Human fingernails were collected from test subjects. The<br>
fingernails were cleaned by brushing with soap solution, sinsed with<br>
deionized water, and allowed to air-dry at room temperature. The<br>
fingernails were then powdered under liquid N2, and 10 mg of the<br>
fingernails was added to each well of a 96-well filter plate. The fingernail<br>
samples were treated for 1 h with blocking buffer consisting of 1 mg/mL<br>
BSA in TBST-0.5%, and then washed with TBST-0.5%. The fingernail<br>
samples were incubated with phage library (Ph.D-12 Phage Display<br>
Peptide Library Kit), and washed 10 times using the same conditions<br>
described in Example 1. After the acidic elution step, described in<br>
Example 1, the fingernail samples were washed three more times with the<br>
elution buffer and then washed three times with TBST-0.5%. The acidtreated<br>
fingernails, which had acid resistant phage peptides still attached,<br>
were used to directly infect E. coli ER2738 cells as described in Example<br>
2. This biopanning process was repeated three times. A total of 75 single<br>
black phage plaques were picked randomly for DNA isolation and -<br>
H<br>
sequencing analysis and two repeated clones were identified. The amino<br>
acid sequences of these phage peptides are listed in Table 8. These<br>
fingernail binding peptides were also found to bind well to bleached hair.<br>
(Table Removed)The frequency represents the number of identical sequences that<br>
occurred out of 75 sequenced clones.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Selection of High Affinity Skin-Binding Phage Peptides<br>
The purpose of this Example was to identify phage peptides that<br>
have a high binding affinity to skin. The modified biopanning method<br>
described in Examples 2 and 4 was used to identify the high affinity, skinbinding<br>
phage-peptide clones. Pig skin served as a model for human skin<br>
in the process.<br>
The pig skin was prepared as described in Example 1. Three<br>
rounds of screenings were performed with the custom, pig skin bottom<br>
biopanning apparatus using the same procedure described in Example 4.<br>
A total of 28 single black phage plaques were picked randomly for DNA<br>
isolation and sequencing analysis and one repeated clone was identified.<br>
The amino acid sequence of this phage peptide, which appeared 9 times<br>
out of the 28 sequences, was TPFHSPENAPGS, given as SEQ ID NO:61.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Quantitative Characterization of the Binding Affinity of<br>
Hair-Binding Phage Clones<br>
The purpose of this Example was to quantify the binding affinity of<br>
phage clones by titering and ELISA,<br>
Titering of Hair-Binding Phaqe Clones:<br>
Phage clones displaying specific peptides were used for comparing<br>
the binding characteristics of different peptide sequences. A titer-based<br>
assay was used to quantify the phage binding. This assay measures the<br>
output pfu retained by 10 mg of hair surfaces, having a signal to noise<br>
ratio of 103 to 104. The input for all the phage clones was 1014 pfu. It<br>
should be emphasized that this assay measures the peptide-expressing<br>
phage particle, rather than peptide binding.<br>
Normal hairs were cut into 0.5 cm lengths and 10 mg of the cut hair<br>
was placed in each well of a 96-well filter plate (Qiagen). Then, the wells<br>
were filled with blocking buffer containing 1mg/mL BSA in TBST-0.5% and<br>
incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The hairs were washed 5 times with TBST-<br>
0.5%. The wells were then filled with 1 ml_ of TBST-0.5% containing 1<br>
mg/mL BSA and then purified phage clones (1014pfu) were added to each<br>
well. The hair samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature<br>
and then washed 10 times with TBST-0.5%. The hairs were transferred to<br>
a clean well and 1.0 mL of a non-specific elution buffer, consisting of 1<br>
mg/mL BSA in 0.2 M Glycine-HCI at pH 2.2, was added to each well. The<br>
samples were incubated for 10 min and then 160 uL of neutralization<br>
buffer (1 M Tris-HCI, pH 9.2) was added to each well. The eluted phages<br>
from each well were transferred to a new tube for titering and sequencing<br>
analysis.<br>
To titer the bound phages, the eluted phage was diluted with SM<br>
buffer to prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of 101 to 108. A 10 uL aliquot of<br>
each dilution was incubated with 200 |jL of mid-log phase £. coli ER2738<br>
(New England BioLabs), and grown in LB medium for 20 min and then<br>
mixed with 3 mL of agarose top (LB medium with 5 mM MgCfe, and 0,7%<br>
agarose) at 45 °C. This mixture was spread onto a LB medium/IPTG/Xgal<br>
plate (LB medium with 15 g/L agar, 0.05 g/L IPTG, and 0.04 g/L Xgal) and<br>
incubated overnight at 37 °C. The blue plaques were counted to calculate<br>
the phage titers, which are given in Table 9.<br>
Characterization of Hair-Binding Phaae Clones bv ELISA:<br>
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to evaluate<br>
the hair-binding specificity of selected phage-peptide clones. Phagepeptide<br>
clones identified in Examples 1 and 2 along with a randomly<br>
chosen control G-F9, KHGPDLLRSAPR (given as SEQ ID NO:63) were<br>
amplified. More than 1014pfu phages were added to pre-blocked hair<br>
surfaces. The same amount of phages was also added to pre-blocked pig<br>
skin surfaces as a control to demonstrate the hair-binding specificity.<br>
A unique hair or pig skin-bottom 96-well apparatus was created by<br>
applying one layer of Parafilm® under the top 96-well block of a Minifold I<br>
Dot-Blot System (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH), adding hair or a<br>
layer of hairless pig skin on top of the Parafilm® cover, and then tightening<br>
the apparatus. For each clone to be tested, the hair-covered well was<br>
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 200 uL of blocking buffer,<br>
consisting of 2% non-fat dry milk (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Inc.) in TBS. A<br>
second Minifold system with pig skin at the bottom of the wells was treated<br>
with blocking buffer simultaneously to serve as a control. The blocking<br>
buffer was removed by inverting the systems and blotting them dry with<br>
paper towels. The systems were rinsed 6 times with wash buffer<br>
consisting of TBST-0.05%. The wells were filled with 200 uL of TBST-<br>
0.5% containing 1 mg/mL BSA and then 10 uL (over 1012 copies) of<br>
purified phage stock was added to each well. The samples were<br>
incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with slow shaking. The non-binding phage<br>
was removed by washing the wells 10 to 20 times with TBST-0.5%. Then,<br>
100 uL of horseradish peroxidase/anti-M13 antibody conjugate<br>
(Amersham USA, Piscataway, NJ), diluted 1:500 in the blocking buffer,<br>
was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The<br>
conjugate solution was removed and the wells were washed 6 times with<br>
TBST-0.05%. TMB substrate (200 uL), obtained from Pierce<br>
Biotechnology (Rockford, IL) was added to each well and the color was<br>
allowed to develop for between 5 to 30 min, typically for 10 min, at room<br>
temperature. Then, stop solution (200 uL of 2 M H2SO4) was added to<br>
each well and the solution was transferred to a 96-well plate and the AASQ<br>
was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices,<br>
Sunnyvale, CA). The resulting absorbance values, reported as the mean<br>
of at least three replicates, and the standard error of the mean (SEM) are<br>
(Table Removed)As can be seen from the data in Table 10, all the hair-binding<br>
clones had a significantly higher binding affinity for hair than the control.<br>
Moreover, the hair-binding clones exhibited various degrees of selectivity<br>
for hair compared to pig skin. Clone D21 had the highest selectivity for<br>
hair, having a very strong affinity for hair and a very low affinity for pig skin.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Confirmation of Peptide Binding Specificity and Affinity<br>
The purpose of this Example was to test the peptide binding site<br>
specificity and affinity of the hair-binding peptide D21 using a competition<br>
ELISA. The ELISA assay only detects phage particles that remain bound<br>
to the hair surface. Therefore, if the synthetic peptide competes with the<br>
phage particle for the same binding site on hair surface, the addition of the<br>
synthetic peptide into the ELISA system will significantly reduce the ELISA<br>
results due to the peptide competition.<br>
The synthetic hair-binding peptide D21, given as SEQ ID NO:46,<br>
was synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA). As a control, an unrelated<br>
synthetic skin-binding peptide, given as SEQ ID NO:61, was added to the<br>
system. The experimental conditions were similar to those used in the<br>
ELISA method described in Example 5. Briefly, 100 uL of Binding Buffer<br>
(1xTBS with 0.1% Tween®20 and 1 mg/mL BSA) and 1011 pfu of the pure<br>
D21 phage particles were added to each well of the 96-weII filter plate,<br>
which contained a sample of normal hair. The synthetic peptide (100 ug )<br>
was added to each well (corresponding to concentration of 0.8 mM). The<br>
reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 h with gentle shaking,<br>
followed by five washes with TBST-0.5%. The remaining steps were<br>
identical to the those used in the ELISA method described in Example 5.<br>
The ELISA results, presented as the absorbance at 450 nm (A45o), are<br>
shown in Table 11. Each individual ELISA test was performed in<br>
triplicate; the values in Table 11 are the means of the triplicate<br>
determinations.<br>
These results demonstrated that the synthetic peptide D21 does<br>
compete with the phage clone D21 for the same binding sites on the hair<br>
surface.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Selection of Shampoo-Resistant Hair-Binding Phaqe-Peptides<br>
Using Biopanning<br>
The purpose of this Example was to select shampoo-resistant hairbinding<br>
phage-peptides using biopanning with shampoo washes.<br>
In order to select shampoo-resistant hair-binding peptides, a<br>
biopanning experiment using 12-mer phage peptide libraries against<br>
normal and bleached hairs was performed, as described in Example 2,<br>
Instead of using normal TBST buffer to wash-off the unbounded phages,<br>
the phage-complexed hairs were washed with 10%, 30% and 50%<br>
shampoo solutions (Pantene Pro-V shampoo, Sheer Volume, Proctor &amp;<br>
Gamble, Cincinnati, OH), for 5 min in separate tubes, followed by six TBS<br>
buffer washes. The washed hairs were directly used to infect host<br>
bacteria! cells as described in the modified biopanning method, described<br>
in Example 2.<br>
A potential problem with this method is the effect of the shampoo<br>
on the phage's ability to infect bacterial host cells. In a control experiment,<br>
a known amount of phage particles was added to a 10% shampoo solution<br>
for 5 min, and then a portion of the solution was used to infect bacterial<br>
cells. The titer of the shampoo-treated phage was 90% lower than that of<br>
the untreated phage. The 30% and 50% shampoo treatments gave eVen<br>
more severe damage to the phage's ability to infect host cells.<br>
Nevertheless, two shampoo-resistant hair-binding phage-peptides were<br>
identified, as shown in Table 12.<br>
Selection of Shampoo-Resistant Hair-Binding Phage-Peptides<br>
Using PCR<br>
The purpose of this Example was to select shampoo-resistant hairbinding<br>
phage-peptides using a PCR method to avoid the problem of<br>
shampoo induced damage to the phage. This principle of the PCR<br>
method is that DMA fragments inside the phage particle can be recovered<br>
using PCR, regardless of the phage's viability, and that the recovered DNA<br>
fragments, corresponding to the hair-binding peptide sequences, can then<br>
been cloned back into a phage vector and packaged into healthy phage<br>
particles.<br>
Biopanning experiments were performed using 7-mer and 12-mer<br>
phage-peptide libraries against normal and bleached hairs, as described in<br>
Example 1. After the final wash, the phage-treated hairs were subjected to<br>
5 min of shampoo washes, followed by six TBS buffer washes. The<br>
shampoo-washed hairs were put into a new tube filled with 1 mL of water,<br>
and boiled for 15 min to release the DNA. This DNA-containing, boiled<br>
solution was used as a DNA template for PCR reactions. The primers<br>
used in the PCR reaction were primers: M13KE-1412 Forward 5'-<br>
CAAGCCTCAGCGACCGAATA -3', given as SEQ ID NO:67 and M13KE-<br>
1794 Reverse 5'- CGTAACACTGAGTTTCGTCACCA -3', given SEQ ID<br>
NO:68. The PCR conditions were: 3 min denaturing at 96 °C, followed by<br>
35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 sec, 50 °C for 30 sec and 60 °C for 2 min. The<br>
PCR products (~400 bp), and M13KE vector (New England BioLabs) were<br>
digested with restriction enzymes Eag I and Acc65 \. The ligation and<br>
transformation conditions, as described in the Ph.D.™ Peptide Display<br>
Cloning System (New England Biolabs), were used. The amino acid<br>
sequence of the resulting shampoo-resistant hair-binding phage-peptide is<br>
NTSQLST, given as SEQ ID N0:70.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Determination of the Affinity of Hair-Binding and Skin-Binding Peptides<br>
The purpose of this Example was to determine the affinity of the<br>
hair-binding and skin-binding peptides for their respective substrates,<br>
measured as MBso values, using an ELISA assay.<br>
Hair-binding and skin-binding peptides were synthesized by<br>
SynPep Inc. (Dublin, CA). The peptides were biotinylated by adding a<br>
biotinylated lysine residue at the C-terminus of the amino acid binding<br>
sequences for detection purposes and an amidated cysteine was added to<br>
the C-terminus of the sequence. The amino acid sequences of the<br>
peptides tested are given as SEQ ID NOs:71-74, as shown in Table 13.<br>
For hair samples, the procedure used was as follows. The setup of<br>
the surface specific 96-well system used was the same as that described<br>
in Example 5. Briefly, the 96-wells with hair or pig skin surfaces were<br>
blocked with blocking buffer (SuperBlock™from Pierce Chemical Co.,<br>
Rockford, IL) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by six washes with<br>
TBST-0.5%, 2 min each, at room temperature. Various concentrations of<br>
biotinylated, binding peptide were added to each well, incubated for 15<br>
min at 37 °C, and washed six times with TBST-0.5%, 2 min each, at room<br>
temperature. Then, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate<br>
(Pierce Chemical Co.) was added to each well (1.0 ug per well), and<br>
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation, the wells<br>
were washed six times with TBST-0.5%, 2 min each at room temperature.<br>
Finally, the color development and the measurement were performed as<br>
described in Example 5.<br>
For the measurement of MBso of the peptide-skin complexes, the<br>
following procedure was used. First, the pigskin was treated to block the<br>
endogenous biotin in the skin. This was done by adding streptavidin to the<br>
blocking buffer. After blocking the pigskin sample, the skin was treated<br>
with D-biotin to block the excess streptavidin binding sites. The remaining<br>
steps were identical to those used for the hair samples.<br>
The results were plotted as A4so versus the concentration of<br>
peptide using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego,<br>
CA). The MBso values were calculated from Scatchard plots and are<br>
summarized in Table 13. The results demonstrate that the binding affinity<br>
of the hair-binding peptides (D21, F35, and I-B5) and the skin binding<br>
peptide (SEQW ID NO:61) for their respective substrate was high, while<br>
the binding affinity of the hair-binding peptides (D-21 and I-B5) for skin<br>
was relatively low.<br>

Summary of MBnn Values for Hair and Skin-Binding Peptides<br>
The peptides tested were biotinylated at the C-terminus of the amino acid<br>
binding sequences and an amidated cysteine was added to the Cterminus<br>
of the binding sequence.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Preparation of a Peptide-Based-Carbon Black Hair Colorant<br>
The purpose of this Example was to prepare a peptide-basedcarbon<br>
black hair colorant by covalently linking the hair-binding peptide<br>
D21, given as SEQ ID NO:46, to the surface of carbon black particles.<br>
The surface of the carbon black particles was functionalized by reaction<br>
with 2)2'-azobis(2methylpropionamide)-dihydrochloride to introduce free<br>
amino groups. The functionalized carbon black particles were then<br>
covalently linked to the specific hair-binding peptide.<br>
Functionalization of Carbon Black Surface:<br>
Carbon black (Nipex® 160-IQ from Degussa, Allendale, NJ), 2.0 g,<br>
and 1.0 g of 2,2'-Azobis(2-methylpropionamide)dihydrochloride (Aldrich,<br>
Milwaukee, Wl) were added to a 100 ml round-bottom flask and 30 ml of<br>
dioxane was added. The flask was purged with nitrogen for 5 min. Then,<br>
the flask was sealed with a rubber septum and the reaction mixture was<br>
stirred at 65 °C for 14 h. After this time, 50 mL of deionized water,<br>
prepared with a Nanopure water purification system<br>
(Barnstead/Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA), was added to the mixture. The<br>
diluted solution was centrifuged to collect the functionalized carbon black<br>
particles and to remove the organic solvent and unreacted reagents. The<br>
carbon black particles were washed with deionized water and centrifuged.<br>
This washing and centrifuging process was repeated 2 more times. The<br>
functionalized carbon black particles were then dried by lyophilization.<br>
Synthesis of t-Boc-Protected Hair-Binding Peptidefrom Phaqe Clone D21<br>
The purpose of this reaction was to protect the ammo end group of<br>
the hair-binding peptide. The hair-binding peptide from phage clone D21<br>
(0.25 g), given as SEQ ID NO:46 (95% purity, obtained from SynPep,<br>
Dublin, CA) was mixed with 2.5 ml of deionized water in a 25 ml roundbottom<br>
flask. Then, 20 mg of NaOH and 0.25 ml of t-butyl alcohol were<br>
added. After stirring the mixture for 2 min, 0.12 g of di-tert-butyl<br>
dicarbonate (t-Boc anhydride) (Aldrich) was added dropwise. The flask<br>
was sealed with a rubber septum and the reaction mixture was stirred<br>
overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was clear at the<br>
beginning of the reaction and became cloudy and then, precipitated after 1<br>
•»<br>
h. Upon addition of water (10 ml), the reaction mixture formed a milky<br>
emulsion, which was then extracted three times with 5 ml portions of<br>
methylene chloride. The organic layer was washed twice with 5 ml<br>
portions of deionized water. The clear water layers were all combined and<br>
dried by lyophilization, yielding 0.20 g of a fluffy white powder (80% yield).<br>
The product was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry<br>
(LC-MS) and was found to have a molecular weight of 1323 g/mol, with a<br>
purity of 90% by weight.<br>
Coupling of Amino-Functionalized Carbon Black with t-Boc-D21 -Peptide:<br>
Amino-functionalized carbon black (87mg), t-Boc-D21-peptide<br>
(80mg) and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (22mg) were added to 3 ml_ of<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF). A solution of dimethyl aminopyridine (17 jaL) in<br>
several drops of THF was added dropwise to this mixture with stirring.<br>
The resulting dark suspension was heated to 40 °C for 6 h with stirring,<br>
followed by stirring overnight at room temperature. Trifluoroacetic acid<br>
(0.6 mL) was added to the product and the mixture was stirred for another<br>
6 h. Then, 5 ml of deionized water was added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The mixture was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant<br>
was decanted. The solid remaining in the centrifuge tube was washed<br>
with deionized water and centrifuged again. This washing was repeated<br>
until the pH of supernatant reached approximately 6.0. The dark residue<br>
was then dried using a lyophilizer for 2 days, yielding a dark powder.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Hair Dyeing Using a Peptide-Based-Carbon Black Hair Colorant<br>
The purpose of this Example was to dye a sample of natural white<br>
hair using the peptide-based-carbon black hair colorant prepared in<br>
Example 10.<br>
A bundle of natural white hair (approximately 100 pieces) (from<br>
International Hair Importers and Products Inc., Bellerose, NY) was cleaned<br>
by mixing with 10 mL of 50% isopropanol for 30 min and then washed at<br>
least 5 times with distilled water. After drying in air, the cleaned hair was<br>
immersed for 30 min in a solution containing 50 mg of the hair-binding D21<br>
peptide-carbon black hair colorant, described in Example 10, dissolved in<br>
10 mL of distilled water. After dying, the hair was washed at least 5 times<br>
with distilled water. The original natural white hair became light black.<br>
The dyed hair was washed three times with a 30% shampoo solution<br>
20 (Pantene Pro-V shampoo) by immersing the hair in the shampoo solution<br>
and stirring with a glass pipette. The hair was then rinsed at least 10 times<br>
with distilled water. The final color of the dyed, natural white hair was very<br>
light black.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Preparation of a Peptide-Based Hair Conditioner<br>
The purpose of this Example was to prepare a peptide-based hair<br>
conditioner by covalently linking the hair-binding D21 peptide, given as<br>
SEQ ID NO:46, with behenyl alcohol using carbodiimide coupling.<br>
Behenyl alcohol (Aldrich), 81.7 mg, and 62.0 mg of dicyclohexyl<br>
carbodiimide (DCC) were dissolved in 2.0 ml of THF in a 25 ml roundbottom<br>
flask. A solution containing 0.25 g of the 9-<br>
fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) N-terminal protected form of SEQ ID<br>
N0:46 (95% purity, obtained from SynPep, Dublin, CA) in 2.0 ml<br>
dimethyformamide (DMF) was added to the above mixture. Then, 50 ^L<br>
of dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was added to the reaction mixture. With<br>
stirring, the reaction mixture was maintained at 40 °C for 3 h, and then at<br>
room temperature overnight. Then the solvent was evaporated under<br>
vacuum at room temperature for 4 h. After this time, the mixture was<br>
dissolved in 25 ml of ethyl acetate, and the unreacted peptide was<br>
extracted 3 times with water using 10 mL of deionized water for each<br>
extraction. The ethyl acetate phase was isolated and the ethyl acetate<br>
was removed using a rotary evaporator. The resulting solid product was<br>
dissolved in a solvent consisting of 2.5 mL of THF and 2.5 ml of DMF, and<br>
1.5 mL of piperidine was added to deblock the amino group of the D21<br>
peptide. This mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature and then the<br>
solvents were removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum. The final<br>
product was characterized by LC/MS.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Preparation of a Peptide-Based Hair Conditioner<br>
The purpose of this Example was to prepare a peptide-based hair<br>
conditioner by covalently linking the hair-binding, cysteine-attached D21<br>
peptide, given as SEQ ID NO:64, with octylamine using the<br>
heterobifunctional cross-linking agent 3-maleimidopropionic acid Nhydroxysuccinimide<br>
ester.<br>
Octylamine, obtained from Aid rich (Milwaukee, Wl) was diluted by<br>
adding 11.6 mg to 0.3 mL of DMF. This diluted solution was added to a<br>
stirred solution containing 25 mg of 3-maleimidopropionic acid Nhydroxysuccinimide<br>
ester (Aldrich) and 5 mg of diisopropylethylamine<br>
(Aldrich) in 0.2 mL of DMF in a 5 mL round bottom flask. The reaction<br>
mixture turned turbid immediately and then became clear several minutes<br>
later. The solution was stirred for another 4 h. The solution was then<br>
dried under high vacuum. The product, octylamine-attached<br>
maleimidopropionate, was purified by column chromatography using a<br>
Silica gel 60 (EMD Chemicals, formerly EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ)<br>
column and DMF/ether as the eluent.<br>
Approximately 12 mg of the above product was placed into a 5 mL<br>
round bottom flask and 50 mg of cysteine-attached D21 peptide (obtained<br>
from SynPep, Dublin, CA), given as SEQ ID NO:64, and 0.5 mL of 0.1 M<br>
phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 were added. The cysteine-attached D21<br>
peptide has 3 glycine residues and a cysteine attached to the end of the<br>
peptide binding sequence of the hair-binding D21 peptide (SEQ ID<br>
NO:46). This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 h. The final<br>
product, the C8-D21 peptide hair conditioner, was purified by extraction<br>
with water/ether.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Preparation of a Peptide-Based-Carbon Black Hair Colorant<br>
The purpose of this Example was to prepare a peptide-based<br>
carbon black hair colorant using carbon black that was functionalized with<br>
ethanol amine. The number of peptides attached to the carbon black<br>
surface was estimated from chemical analyses.<br>
Preparation of Acid Functionalized Carbon Black Particles:<br>
In a 1,000 mL beaker was added 25.5 g of carbon black (Nipex-<br>
160-IQ from Degussa, 100 g of ammonium persulfate [(NH^SaOe] (98%<br>
from Aldrich), and 333 ml of 1.0 M H2SO4 (98%, GR grade from EMD<br>
Chemicals) aqueous solution. The mixture was stirred with a magnetic stir<br>
plate for 24 h at room temperature. After this time, the reaction mixture<br>
was transferred to a 500 mL plastic centrifuge tube and centrifuged at<br>
8,500 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant became clear and was removed.<br>
The product was washed 6 times with deionized water using centrifugation<br>
to collect the product after each wash. The final product was neutral (pH =<br>
6.0) and was dried by lyophilization for 24 h. The average size of the<br>
functionalized carbon black particles was 100 nm, as measured using a<br>
particle size analyzer (Microtrac Ultrafine Particle Analyzer, Microtrac Inc.,<br>
Montgomeryville, PA).<br>
Preparation of Amino-Functionalized Carbon Black Using Ethanolamine:<br>
Two grams of the dried, acid functionalized carbon black, 25 mL of<br>
ethanolamine (99% from Aldrich) and 1 mL of concentrated H2S04 (98%,<br>
GR grade from EMD Chemicals) were mixed in a 100 mL round bottom<br>
flask. The mixture was stirred rapidly with a magnetic stirrer and refluxed<br>
for 6 h. After the mixture cooled to room temperature, a sufficient amount<br>
of ammonium hydroxide (28.0-30.0% of NH3 from EMD Chemicals) was<br>
added to neutralize the mixture. Then, the mixture was centrifuged and<br>
washed with water, as described in Example 6. The final product was<br>
neutral (pH = 6.0) and was dried by lyophilization for 24 h. The dried,<br>
amino functionalized carbon black was readily dispersed in water.<br>
The surface composition of the functionalized carbon black was<br>
analyzed by ESCA at the DuPont Corporate Center for Analytical Science.<br>
In ESCA, monoenergetic X-rays are focused onto the surface of a material<br>
to excite surface atoms. Core and valence shell electrons with energies<br>
characteristic of elements in the top 10 nm of the surface are ejected and<br>
their energy analyzed to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on<br>
surface composition. The kinetic energy of the electrons emitted provides<br>
information about the functional groups and oxidation states of the surface<br>
species. In this Example, the X-ray source used was a magnesium anode<br>
with an energy of 1253.6 eV. The samples were analyzed at a 45 degree<br>
exit angle (approximately 5 to 10 nm sampling depth). The ESCA analysis<br>
results are shown in Table 14. For ethanolamine-functionalized carbon<br>
black, the surface was mainly composed of unreacted -COOH groups and<br>
-C(=0)-OCH2CH2NH2 groups. To calculate the ratio of amine (y) to<br>
carboxylic acid groups (x), a simple equation was used, specifically,<br>
y/(x+y) = (N%/14)/(O%/32) for ethanolamine. The results are given in<br>
Coupling of Amino-Functionalized Carbon Black with t-Boc-D21 -Peptide:<br>
The amino-functionalized carbon black particles were then<br>
covalently linked to the specific hair-binding peptide D21, given as SEQ ID<br>
N0:46. The t-Boc protected D21 peptide was synthesized as described in<br>
Example 10. Then, amino-functionalized carbon black (87 mg), t-Boc-<br>
D21-peptide (80 mg) and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC) (22 mg) were<br>
added to 3 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF). A solution of<br>
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (17 \iL) in several drops of THF was<br>
added dropwise to this mixture with stirring. The resulting dark<br>
suspension was heated to 40 °C for 6 h with stirring, followed by stirring<br>
overnight at room temperature. To remove the t-Boc protecting group<br>
from the D21 peptide, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (0.6 ml_) was added to the<br>
product and the mixture was stirred for another 6 h. Then, 5 ml_ of<br>
deionized water was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was<br>
centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant was decanted.<br>
The solid remaining in the centrifuge tube was washed with deionized<br>
water and centrifuged again. This washing was repeated until the pH of<br>
supernatant reached approximately 6.0. The dark residue was then dried<br>
using a lyophilizer for 2 days, yielding a dark powder.<br>
The amino-functionalized carbon black particles and the peptidelinked<br>
carbon black particles were analyzed by ESCA, elemental analysis,<br>
and TGA (thermogravimetric analysis). The analytical results showed that<br>
the organic layer on the carbon black modified with ethanolamine was<br>
approximately 12% of the total weight. After the D21 peptides were<br>
attached to the carbon black particles, the peptide weight percentage was<br>
in the range of 18 - 30%. Therefore, for a 100 nm carbon black particle, a<br>
total of 9.5 x 104 molecules were attached to the surface after reacting<br>
with ethanolamine, and a total of 7,700 D21 peptide molecules were<br>
attached to the carbon black surface after reaction with the peptide. A<br>
calculation of the peptide density on the carbon black surface, revealed<br>
that each D21 peptide occupied 4 nm2, which is comparable to the peptide<br>
density attached to the phage, approximately 12 nm2.<br>

EXAMPLE 15<br>
Specificity of the Peptide-Based-Carbon Black Hair Colorant<br>
The purpose of this Example was to demonstrate the specificity of<br>
the D21 peptide-carbon black hair colorant.<br>
The D21 peptide-based-carbon black colorant was prepared as<br>
described in Example 14.<br>
A piece of pig skin (10 cm x 10 cm), obtained from a local<br>
supermarket, was cleaned by mixing with 30 ml_ of 30% isopropanol for 10<br>
min and then washed at least 5 times with distilled water. After drying in<br>
air, the cleaned pig skin was immersed in a plate holder with multiple wells<br>
containing a solution of 50 mg of the D21 peptide-carbon black colorant<br>
dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water. After applying the colorant for 15<br>
min, the pig skin was washed three times with a 30% shampoo solution<br>
(Pantene Pro-V shampoo) by dropping the shampoo solution into the wells<br>
and decanting it. Then, the pig skin was rinsed 5 times with distilled water.<br>
A normal white hair sample, obtained from International Hair *<br>
Importers and Products (Bellerose, NY), was treated in the same manner<br>
as the pig skin.<br>
After washing, the pig skin showed negligible dark color, while the<br>
hair was very light black. These results demonstrate that the D21 peptidecarbon<br>
black colorant has specific binding to hair, but not to skin.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
Preparation of a Peptide-Polvsiloxane Hair Conditioner<br>
The purpose of this Example was to synthesize a D21 peptidepolysiloxane<br>
hair conditioner. The reactive side functional groups of the<br>
D21 peptide, given as SEQ ID N0:46, were fully protected so that the<br>
reaction with the polysiloxane proceeded only with the C-terminal group of<br>
the peptide. In addition, a tripeptide spacer, consisting of glycine<br>
residues, was added to the C-terminal end of the binding sequence.<br>
Fifty milligrams of the fully protected D21 peptide Fmoc-<br>
R(Pbf)T(tBu)N(Trt)AAD(OtBu)H(Trt)PAAVT(tBu)GGG (where Fmoc means<br>
fluorenylmethoxylcarbonyl; Pbf means 2,2,6,4,7-<br>
pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl; tBu means t-butyl; Trt means<br>
trityl; and Otbu means t-butoxyl) (MW2522, 0.02 mmol, 95% purity from<br>
SynPep, Dublin, CA), given as SEQ ID NO:78 was dissolved in 1 mL of<br>
dimethyformamide (DMF, from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a 5 ml<br>
round bottom flask. Polysiloxane fluid 2-8566 (77 mg) (N%=0.875%,<br>
0.024 mmol of-NHa, from Dow Corning, Midland, Ml) was dissolved in 2<br>
mL of THF (E. Merck) in a sample vial, then transferred into the round<br>
bottom flask containing the peptide solution. Then, 5 mg of dicyclohexyl<br>
carbodiimide (DCC, 0.024 mmol) and 5 jiL of dimethylaminopyridine<br>
(DMAP) were added to the flask. The flask was sealed with a rubber<br>
stopper and the reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 5 h and then, at<br>
room temperature overnight. After the reaction was completed, the<br>
solvent was pumped out under vacuum. After drying, 122 mg of the solid<br>
product was obtained. The yield was about 90%.<br>
The solid product was dissolved in N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC,<br>
from EMD Chemicals) and 5 mg/mL of the product solution in DMAC was<br>
prepared for GPC (gel permeation chromatography) analysis with<br>
refractive index detection to determine the molecular weight. The original<br>
polysiloxane (Dow Corning 2-8566) was not soluble in DMAC and was not<br>
observed in the separation region of the chromatogram. The D21 peptide<br>
had a sharp, low molecular weight peak, and the product sample<br>
contained 2 peaks, one from the free D21 peptide and a broad peak,<br>
which was attributed to polysiloxane grafted with D21 peptide. The<br>
weight-average molecular weight (Mw) was calculated from<br>
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) standards. The Mw of D21 peptide and<br>
the peptide-polysiloxane conditioner were 4.7x103, and 4.4x104,<br>
respectively.<br>
A cleavage reagent (referred to as Reagent K) having the following<br>
composition:<br>
trifluoroaceticacid/H2O/thioanisole/ethanedithiol/phenoI (85:5:5:2.5:2.5,<br>
by volume) was used to cleave the protecting groups from the side<br>
functional groups of the D21 peptide. Reagent K (1 mL) was pre-cooled to<br>
-20 °C and then, added to 100 mg of the D21 peptide-polysiloxane<br>
conditioner. The mixture was stirred for 3-4 h at room temperature and<br>
then Reagent K was removed under high vacuum. Then, the Fmoc<br>
protecting group was removed from the N-terminus of the peptide by<br>
adding 61.2 mg of 20 vol % piperidine in DMF to the mixture and stirring<br>
for 30 min, followed by pumping under high vacuum. The final product<br>
was not completely soluble in THF, DMF, or DMAC. GPC analysis of the<br>
final product was not possible because of the low solubility.<br>
EXAMPLE.17<br>
Effectiveness of Peptide-Based Hair Conditioner<br>
The purpose of this Example was to demonstrate the effectiveness<br>
of a peptide-based hair conditioner in reducing frictional forces in human<br>
hair fibers and to compare its performance against a commercial<br>
conditioning agent. Fiber friction is a significant contributor to combing<br>
behavior of hair fiber assemblies (i.e., multiple fibers). The single hair fiber<br>
characterization of frictional forces can be related to the combing behavior<br>
of the hair assembly. Interfiber friction studies illustrate the improvement<br>
to the hair surface from conditioner applications. The lower the interfiber<br>
friction, the smoother the hair looks and feels, and the easier it is to comb.<br>
The interfiber friction measurement method employed in this Example is<br>
one of a few hair fiber tests to give hard, quantitative data and is generally<br>
accepted in the industry.<br>
The peptide-based hair conditioner described in Example 12, which<br>
consists of the hair-binding peptide given as SEQ ID NO:46 covalently<br>
linked to behenyl alcohol, was used in a formulation consisting of a mixture<br>
of 0.25% by weight of the peptide-based conditioner and 1.5% by weight<br>
of Performix™ Lecithin (ADM Lecithin, Decatur. IL) in distilled water. The<br>
aqueous solution was mixed at 7000 rpm for 4 min using a Silverson<br>
L4RT-A High Shear Laboratory Mixer (Silverson Machines, Inc., East<br>
Longmeadow, MA) with a general purpose disintegrating head and a 0.95<br>
cm mini-micro tubular frame. A 0.5% solution of Dow Corning 929<br>
Cationic Emulsion (Dow Corning Corp., Midland, Ml), a commercial<br>
conditioning agent, in distilled water was prepared using identical mixing<br>
conditions.<br>
86<br>
European dark brown hair swatches (International Hair Importers<br>
and Products) were cleaned before testing by immersing in isopropanol for<br>
30 min, then washing 10 times with distilled water. Single hair fibers from<br>
these swatches were sent to Textile Research Institute (TRI), Princeton,<br>
NJ, for friction testing. At TRI, the hair fibers were immersed in the<br>
conditioner solutions for 5 min at approximately 35 °C without agitation.<br>
Afterwards, they were rinsed for 1 min in lukewarm water and then dried<br>
overnight at 21 °C and 65% relative humidity.<br>
Frictional force measurements of treated hair fibers were measured<br>
by the Interfiber friction test using a single-fiber friction apparatus, as<br>
described by Kamath et al. (J. Appl. Polymer Sci., 85:394-414 (2002)).<br>
Hair fibers were evaluated at high normal forces (high load) (0.74 g)<br>
against a chromed steel wire, crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, using an<br>
Instron Tensile Testing machine. Low normal forces (low load) (8.5 mg)<br>
were measured against another single hair fiber using the TRI/Scan™<br>
Surface Force Analyzer (Textile Research Institute). This apparatus"<br>
measures small forces with a Cahn® microbalance (mass resolution of 0.1<br>
mg) and features a computer controlled stage. The results of these<br>
measurements are given in Table 15.<br>
The peptide-based conditioner had a lower average friction than the<br>
Dow Corning 929 Cationic Emulsion conditioner in both cases.<br>
Subsequently, a conditioning sample of 1.5% lecithin was tested for fiber<br>
friction (low load) and the average mean frictional force was 3.366 mg,<br>
indicating that the conditioning effects observed with the peptide-based<br>
conditioner was not due to the presence of the lecithin in the formulation.<br>
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the peptide-based hair<br>
conditioner.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Preparation of a Peptide-Based Hair Colorant<br>
The purpose of this Example was to prepare a peptide-based hair<br>
colorant by covalently attaching the D21 hair-binding peptide (SEQ ID<br>
NO:46) to Disperse Orange 3 dye. The dye was first functionalized with<br>
isocyanate and then reacted with the D21 peptide.<br>
Functionalization of Disperse Orange 3:<br>
In a dry box, 14.25 g of Disperse Orange 3 (Aldrich) was<br>
suspended in 400 ml of dry THF in an addition funnel. A 2-liter, four-neck<br>
reaction flask (Corning Inc., Corning, NY; part no. 1533-12), containing a<br>
magnetic stir bar, was charged with 200 ml of dry toluene. The flask was<br>
fitted with a cold finger condenser (Corning Inc., part no. 1209-04) and<br>
with a second cold finger condenser with an addition funnel, and was<br>
placed on an oil bath in a hood.<br>
Phosgene (25.4 ml_) was condensed into the reaction flask at room<br>
temperature. After phosgene addition was complete, the temperature of<br>
the oil bath was raised to 80 °C and the Disperse Orange 3 suspension<br>
was added to the reaction flask dropwise in 100 ml increments over 2 h,<br>
while monitoring the reaction temperature and gas discharge from the<br>
scrubber. The temperature was maintained at or below 64 °C throughout<br>
the addition. After addition was complete, the reactants were heated at 64<br>
°C for 1 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring<br>
overnight.<br>
The reaction solvents were vacuum-distilled to dryness, while<br>
maintaining the contents at or below 40 °C, and vacuum was maintained<br>
for an additional hour. The reaction flask was transferred to a dry box; the<br>
product was collected and dried overnight (15.65 g). The desired product<br>
was confirmed by proton NMR.<br>
Coupling of Isocvanate Functionalized Dve with D21 Hair-Binding Peptide:<br>
Isocyanate functionalized Disperse Orange 3 [(2-(4-<br>
isocyantophenyl)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)diazene ](16mg), prepared as described<br>
above, was dissolved in 5 ml of DMF and added to a solution containing<br>
75 mg of non-protected D21 peptide (SEQ ID N0:46), obtained from<br>
SynPep, dissolved in 10 mL of DMF. The solution was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated yielding 91 mg of a<br>
purplish powder. The product was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry<br>
and was found to have a molecular weight of 1766 g/mol, consistent with<br>
covalent attachment of the dye molecule to the peptide.<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>
Selection of Tooth-Binding Peptides Using Biopanning<br>
The purpose of this prophetic Example is to describe how to identify<br>
phage peptides that bind to teeth with high affinity.<br>
Extracted human teeth, which may be obtained from a Dental<br>
Office, are cleaned by brushing with soap solution, rinsed with deionized<br>
water, and allowed to air-dry at room temperature. The teeth are placed in<br>
a 15 mL centrifuge tube (Corning Inc., Acton, MA), one tooth per tube.<br>
The teeth samples are treated for 1 h with blocking buffer consisting of 1<br>
mg/mL BSA in TBST-0.5%, and then washed with TBST-0.5%. The teeth<br>
samples are incubated with the phage library (Ph.D-12 Phage Display<br>
Peptide Library Kit) and washed 10 times using the same conditions<br>
described in Example 1. After the acidic elution step, described in<br>
Example 1, the teeth samples are washed three more times with the<br>
elution buffer and then washed three times with TBST-0.5%. The acidtreated<br>
teeth, which have acid resistant phage peptides still attached, are<br>
used to directly infect E. coli ER2738 cells as described in Example 2. The<br>
amplified and isolated phages are contacted with a fresh tooth sample and<br>
the biopanning procedure is repeated two more times. After the third<br>
round of biopanning, the acid-treated teeth are used to directly infect E.<br>
coli ER2738 cells, and the cells are cultured as described in Example 1.<br>
Single black plaques are randomly picked for DNA isolation and sequence<br>
analysis. The single plaque lysates are prepared following the<br>
manufacture's instructions (New England Biolabs) and the single stranded<br>
phage genomic DNA is purified using the QIAprep Spin M13 Kit (Qiagen,<br>
Valencia, CA) and sequenced using -96 gill sequencing primer, as<br>
described in Example 1.<br>
The identified peptide sequences will have a binding affinity for<br>
teeth. The binding specificity and affinity of the identified tooth-binding<br>
peptides is determined as described in Example 6.<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
Preparation of a Peptide-Based Tooth Whitener<br>
The purpose of this prophetic Example is to describe how to<br>
prepare a peptide-based tooth whitener by coupling a tooth-binding<br>
peptide to the white pigment, titanium dioxide.<br>
Dry titanium dioxide having an average particle size less than 2 urn<br>
(available from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, DE) is<br>
treated with a solution of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (available from<br>
Aldrich) in dry acetone to covalently attach amino groups to the surface of<br>
the titanium dioxide. The excess reagent is removed by decantation after<br>
centrifuging to settle out the particles. The resultant particles are then<br>
treated with sufficient glutaraldehyde (available from Sigma Chemical Co.)<br>
to react with the surface attached amino groups.<br>
A tooth binding peptide, identified using the method described in<br>
Example 19, is obtained from SynPep. The tooth-binding peptide<br>
sequence is terminated with 1-5 lysine residues at the C terminus. The<br>
tooth-binding peptide is then added to the glutaraldehyde-treated titanium<br>
dioxide particles and is covalently coupled to the pendant free aldehyde<br>
groups on glutaraldehyde through an amine group on the peptide.<br><br><br><br><br>
