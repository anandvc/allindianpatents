Currently, in several WHO' studies, the contraceptive action of a combination that consists of an -orally administered, geetagen (D-spc?t-ir.edrcvy progfestercr^ acetate, levonorgestrel ester, cyproterou$ acetate) is tested on men with a parent er ally administered, androgen (testosterone<br>
Sy contrast, birth control in men is possible with these compounds in one de-sage form,- specifically an oral dosage form or a dosage form that is to be administered trar^sderrnally., In addition, the compounds according to the invention with androgenic action can be used with older males for male HRT (Hormone Replacement: Therapy) »<br>
Those compounds of : general formula I, which can more likely be classified, under 2), i.e,, compounds • v.lth mainly androgenic act ion and. ws&amp;ker gestc.g'snic action, can be used for male hcrmori* therapy.  Preparations for tree ting a hyper -gonadiam ar.d for treating male infertility and disturbances of potency can be produced with them.<br>
For trials birth control and fax- treating the- above -mentioned, androgenic disease agents, the ccirrponrids according<br>
to the invention are uesi in the dosages that are equivalent' in action to the testosterone oe:ianth.at:
.Amounts that ars equivalent in action are those amounts that,- in the t-5St on andrcgenic action on the seminal vesicles and/or prostate cf the rat (Hershberger Test) , a.chievs comparable action.<br>
For HRT in. man, to date a substitution close cf a'DDroxi-nately 10 mg/day of testosterone oensnthate is uwsd.<br>
For male birth control studies that are performed by the 7HO, different testosterone esters (oenanthate, bucyclate, indecanoate) are used in the range of approximately 10-30 g/day.<br>
