				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns to a 'Tobacco' products particularly<br>
known as 'Khaini' in a novel pouch pack for easy use without<br>
affecting the organs and the method for the preparation of the<br>
Same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Tobacco is anciently used in different forms because of the Presence of different alkaloids e.g. nicotine, nicotimine and nornicotine etc. in the leaves of the tobacco plant - Nicotaiana tobacum. The pharmacological action of the tobacco is to produce transient stimulation due to rapid depolarization, and subsequently persistant depression due to hyperpolarization of the ganglion cells in all the autonomic ganglia. It also produces initial stimulation of adrenal medulla leading to discharge of apinephrine in to the blood. It also markedly stimulates the CNS and produces tremor and in Large doses convulsion. Due to its marked effect it is used traditionally for the purpose of pleasure after developing fatigueness in the nervous system.<br>
The ancient people used tobacco in the different forms as per their Culture which are known as Bidi, Snuff, Khaini, Zarda etc. to meet the demand of pleasure. In the past, it is used generally in the crude form without purifying and testing the contents of the active<br>
Ingredients which are some times causing harmful effect to the users. At the different times it has been developed scientifically keeping in mind the harmful effect of the product for different reasons. The conscious of the people are changing day to day to use the said product in a scientific manner to live in a modern society. The defects of the said product are mainly concerned with the use of low varieties of tobacco, unhygienic preparation of the product &amp; poor quality of packaging.<br>
Moreover, the plant materials which are used for the preparation of the same are not of pure quality and directly used in such a way so that the different parts of the organ are exposed to that plant material creating a obnoxious smell in the mouth and making injury to the gum and teeth. To remove the defects in the prior art the present invention aims to prepare a product which are free from the said defects.<br>
The regular products available in the market are prepared in the different processes which require different mode of processing before chewing like removal of impurities e.g. chunna (lime), dusts and other foreign particles. The user has to take product in his hand and rubbing it for sometime to prepare the actual product and blow-off the impurities before chewing. This results inconvenient for using. Further, during the said preparation his hands may not be<br>
Clean and the working environment may not be in hygienic condition, which can induce other toxic particles into the product causing health hazard. It is also observed that by the said process 60% of the plant material is wasted and only 40% can be in use. To remove those defects a novel product is developed which can be simply placed inside the mouth between the either sides of rear end of tooth without chewing. The aim of the invention is also to eliminate the toxic materials coming with saliva after chewing because it will cause the harmful effect of the internal glands.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to prepare the product in such a way<br>
that it will not adversely affect the gum and teeth.<br>
That further object of the invention is to use the active component<br>
of the tobacco by a means to arrest the plant materials.<br>
The further object is to prepare the product in a novel manner so<br>
that the question of chewing tobacco does not arise.<br>
Further the dose of every pack is maintained in such a way that it<br>
will  serve the purpose  of pleasure avoiding  large  amount of use<br>
and   the   misuse   can  be  prevented,   which  ultimately  reduces   the<br>
uses of the product in a cost effective manner.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a formulation of tobacco with Lime, Water, Menthol, oil Spices and Flavour in a different proportion to make the product palatable and useble form. The percentage of different ingredients is chosen as per the quality and the active components present in the tobacco. So, the variation of composition requires making the product softy &amp; increasing the self-life to use it for a longer period.<br>
The process for the preparation of the formulation and preserving it within a food grade cellulose filter paper in hygienic condition by a automatic packing machine so that it does not contaminate with other toxic material and dusts. The process comprises of the following steps.<br>
(a)	Removing the impurities  adhered with raw tobacco leaves by<br>
a conventional process<br>
(b)	Drying the said leaves in oven not over 60 Cor in sunlight<br>
With a cover so that any particulate matter can not come<br>
Into contact with the said leaves<br>
(c)	Grinding the dried leaves in a powder from (not over 80<br>
Mesh)<br>
(d)	Mixing the said powder leaves with the ingredients like lime.<br>
Water,    menthol,    oil,    spices    &amp;   flavour   in    a   mixer   at<br>
the rate of 40-60   RPM for 25-30 mints<br>
(e)	Packing  the  pre-determined  portion   of the  product  obtained<br>
from step (d) into the food grade cellulose filter paper in the<br>
hygienic condition through an automatic packing machine.<br>
(f)	Preserving the individual pouch in the poly pack under inert<br>
medium so that the final oxidation of the finish product can<br>
be prevented<br>
The composition of the tobacco formulation is as fallows:<br>
Ingredients	Percentage (W/W)<br>
Tobacco	70-75<br>
Lime	3.0-7.0<br>
Water	15-20<br>
Oil	4.0-8.0<br>
Spices	2.0-3.0<br>
Menthol	1.0-2.0<br>
Flavour	1.0-2.0<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is to prepare a tobacco which can be used without chewing and a fixed weight can be taken for the purpose of pleasure. To achieve this product, it is developed in such a way that only fixed formulated materials are packed in the food grade cellulose filter paper to allow the active principles of the tobacco coming to the saliva. The undesirable materials within the filer pack shall be arrested and could not come into the human system to cause injurious to health.<br>
It is also observed that some tobacco leaves have sharp edges like small hard pieces. While chewing the regular tobacco, this type of sharp hard pieces can pierce through the soft skin inside the mouth which make punctures and wounds into the gum and in the long run it could develop the serious health problems like throat cancer or gum cancer etc.<br>
For the above reasons the chewing tobacco is injurious to health. The product of this invention totally avoids those kind of hazards and health problems to ensure the product safely in use. Pure high quality of tobacco leaves are taken and dried as herein described before grinding. This process requires 5-6 days to achieve the moisture content 10-15%. The moisture content of the<br>
Leaves is measured in every day to reach into the idea whether the plant materials are ready for use.<br>
The dried leaves are grinded to the powder form of particles size within 80 mesh because it is bserved that the size of particles are capable of giving maximum pleasure to the users because of maximum extraction of active components stated in the prior art. To achieve into the said particle size multiple sieving of powder material from the net of fixed mesh size is required.<br>
The powder leaves of desired size is mixed with the other ingredients like lime, water, menthol, oil, spices &amp; flavour at a different proportion to get the maximum charging effect of the formulation by generation the active components (alkaloids). The proportion varies wide range as per the requirement of the pleasure. So no fixed formulation is suggested for this purpose. The major beauty of the invention is to pack the said tobacco formulation into a food grade cellulose filter paper in such a way that only allows the active components required for pleasure outside from the pouch. The other components cannot be either extracted by the saliva or cannot be coming out from the said filter paper. This will minimize the health hazards.<br><br>
A   comparative   chat   of  the regular products of tobacco is in<br>
invented   product   and   the   other en below <br>
Product of invention Regular Tobacco Product<br><br><br>

No chewing required only pure flavour nicotine extract coming outside from the pouch Chewing   required.     Impurities along with plant material  with toxic  principles   entered   with saliva causing harmful effect.<br><br><br>
No skin, tooth or gum problems reported. Gum and  tooth  problem arises due to the punchers &amp;  wound created from the sharp edge of plant   material   leading   cancer and other dreadful disease. <br>
