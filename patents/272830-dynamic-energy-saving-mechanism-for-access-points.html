wireless communication networks, and more particularly, to a dynamic energy saving<br>
mechanism for access points.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Access points enable communication devices to connect to and transmit<br>
information via a communication network. Mobile access points allow for continuous<br>
connectivity to the communication network (such as the Internet) without being<br>
restrained by the coverage area of a fixed access point. However, because mobile access<br>
points typically run on batteries, mobile access points can only operate for a limited<br>
amount of time without an external power source.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Various embodiments are disclosed for reducing power consumption in an<br>
access point. In one embodiment, the access point receives, from a station, a message<br>
indicating a station sleep interval associated with the station. The station sleep interval<br>
indicates a time interval in which the station will enter a sleep mode. Access point quiet<br>
information comprising an access point sleep interval is calculated based, in part, on the<br>
station sleep interval. The access point sleep interval indicates a time interval in which<br>
the access point will enter a sleep mode. The access point quiet information is<br>
transmitted to the station to prevent the station from initiating transmissions during the<br>
access point sleep interval. A start of the access point sleep interval is determined based<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
[0039] The description that follows includes exemplary systems, methods, techniques,<br>
instruction sequences, and computer program products that embody techniques of the<br>
present inventive subject matter. However, it is understood that the described<br>
embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. For instance, although<br>
some examples refer to mobile phones that can operate as access points, some<br>
embodiments may include other types of mobile devices that can operate as access points,<br>
or access points that can be powered by either an external power source or batteries. For<br>
instance, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not<br>
been shown in detail in order not to obfuscate the description.<br>
[0040] Traditionally, access points have been based on a service model that requires the<br>
access points to always be available to receive transmissions from one or more clients<br>
(e.g., communicating stations). Mobile access points (e.g., mobile phones behaving as<br>
access points) can provide portability and the ability to connect to a communication<br>
network (e.g., Internet) at any time without the need for access to a power source.<br>
However, the access point service model requiring the access point to always be available<br>
and the access point’s limited battery capacity reduces the time that the mobile access<br>
point can be used. Power saving mechanisms can implemented on the mobile access<br>
point by altering the service model that requires the access point to always be available.<br>
In implementing the power saving mechanisms, the access point can be configured to<br>
enter into a low powered state for a predefined period of time based, at least in part, on<br>
sleep intervals associated with the clients connected to the access point. By operating in<br>
a low powered state during predefined intervals, the mobile access point can conserve<br>
power and prolong battery life.<br>
[0041] Figure 1 is an example conceptual diagram illustrating network components<br>
configured to enable energy conservation in an access point. Figure 1 depicts an access<br>
point 102 in communication with a station 112 via a wireless communication network<br>
12<br>
116. The access point 102 can be a mobile access point or a mobile phone configured to<br>
act as an access point. The access point 102 comprises a transceiver unit 106, a power<br>
saving unit 108, and processing units 110. The transceiver unit 106 is connected to the<br>
power saving unit 108 and the processing unit 110. The power saving unit 108 is also<br>
connected to the processing unit 110.<br>
[0042] At stage A, the transceiver unit 106 in the access point 102 receives a message<br>
from the station 112 indicating a time interval for which the connected station 112 will be<br>
in sleep mode (“station sleep interval”). The station enters the sleep mode, i.e., a low<br>
powered state, to conserve energy and preserve battery life. The station 112 may be<br>
connected to the access point 102 or may be attempting to connect to the access point<br>
102.<br>
[0043] At stage B, the power saving unit 108 in the access point 102 determines when<br>
and for how long the access point should quiet the communication channel and enter into<br>
a sleep mode. The power saving unit 108 can calculate how long the access point 102<br>
remains in sleep mode based on the station sleep interval (indicated by the station 112 at<br>
stage A). The access point 102 may be connected to a plurality of stations and each<br>
station 112 connected to the access point 102 can be associated with a different station<br>
sleep interval. In other words, each of the plurality of stations can enter the sleep mode at<br>
a different time and remain in the sleep mode for a different period of time. Therefore,<br>
the power saving unit 108 calculates access point quiet information based on when and<br>
for how long each of the connected stations 112 are in sleep mode. The access point<br>
quiet information can indicate a time instant at which the access point 102 enters the<br>
sleep mode, a time instant at which the access point 102 wakes up from the sleep mode, a<br>
time interval for which the access point 102 is in sleep mode (“access point sleep<br>
interval”), etc. In the example of Figure 1, the access point 102 is shown connected to<br>
one station 112. Therefore, the access point 102 can quiet the channel, enter the sleep<br>
mode, wake up from the sleep mode, allow access to the channel, etc. based on the<br>
connected station’s sleep interval. If no stations are connected to the access point 102,<br>
the access point 102 can wake up from the sleep mode every beacon interval, transmit a<br>
13<br>
beacon, wait for a response for a preconfigured period of time, and enter the sleep mode<br>
again.<br>
[0044] At stage C, the transceiver unit 106 in the access point 102 transmits a beacon,<br>
or another suitable message, indicating the access point quiet information determined at<br>
stage B. By transmitting the access point quiet information, the access point 102<br>
indicates, to each of the connected stations 112 and other stations that are not connected<br>
to the access point 102, when and for how long the channel will be quieted and the access<br>
point will be in sleep mode. The access point may also use the quiet information to<br>
indicate when the access point 102 wakes up from the sleep mode, exchanges<br>
data/management information, and opens up the communication channel for access. The<br>
access point 102 may also indicate how often the access point enters sleep mode, how<br>
long the access point remains in sleep mode, etc. In one implementation, the access point<br>
102 can indicate when and for how long the access point will be in sleep mode in terms<br>
of a beacon interval time period. For example, the access point 102 can indicate, in the<br>
quiet information, that the access point 102 will enter the sleep mode at the next beacon<br>
interval, wake up after two beacon intervals, remain awake to receive and transmit<br>
information for one beacon interval, and then enter the sleep mode. In another<br>
implementation, the access point 102 can use any suitable time unit (e.g., milliseconds,<br>
etc.) to indicate when and for how long the access point 102 will quiet the<br>
communication channel and enter the sleep mode. The station 112 may use the quiet<br>
information to determine how long the communication channel will be available for<br>
access.<br>
[0045] At stage D, the station 112 receives the transmitted beacon. The station 112<br>
extracts the transmitted access point quiet information from the received beacon. The<br>
station 112 can use the beacon for time synchronization. The station 112 can also use the<br>
access point quiet information to identify when and for how long access to the<br>
communication channel will be blocked.<br>
[0046] At stage E, the station 112 enters the sleep mode. In one implementation, a<br>
power unit (not shown) in the station 112 may determine that the time interval for<br>
14<br>
which the station 112 will be in sleep mode has begun. The station 112 may update a<br>
station sleep timer with the station sleep interval. The station may use the station sleep<br>
timer to determine exactly when the station 112 should enter sleep mode. In one<br>
implementation, on determining that the station sleep timer has expired (e.g., counted<br>
down to zero), the power unit may cause the station 112 to enter the sleep mode. The<br>
power unit may direct the station’s transceiver to stop transmitting or receiving signals.<br>
The power unit may also direct one or more other processing units in the station 112 to<br>
switch to a low powered state to conserve energy. Additionally, before the station enters<br>
sleep mode, the station (or the power unit) can update a “station available timer” with the<br>
amount of time that should elapse before the station wakes up from the sleep mode.<br>
[0047] At stage F, the power saving unit 108 in the access point 102 determines that the<br>
access point 102 should quiet the communication channel and enter a sleep mode. As<br>
described with reference to the station 112, in one implementation, the access point 102<br>
can also comprise an access point sleep timer. The power saving unit 108 can monitor<br>
the access point sleep timer and direct the access point 102 to enter the sleep mode when<br>
the access point sleep timer expires. For example, the power saving unit 108 can direct<br>
the transceiver unit 104 and the other processing units 110 in the access point 102 to<br>
switch to a low powered state to conserve battery power. While in the sleep mode, the<br>
access point 102 may not transmit information to or receive information from the stations<br>
112. Thus, by transmitting the access point quiet information in the beacon (at stage B)<br>
to all stations connected to or intending to connect to the access point 102, the access<br>
point 102 ensures that no station 112 transmits information while the access point 102 is<br>
in the sleep mode.<br>
[0048] At stage G, the power saving unit 108 determines that the communication<br>
channel should be opened for access. The power saving unit 108 may comprise a timer<br>
indicating how much time should elapse before the access point wakes up from sleep<br>
mode. When the timer reaches zero, the power saving unit 108 can trigger the access<br>
point 102 (e.g., the transceiver unit 106 and the processing units 110) to wake from the<br>
low powered state. In one implementation, the power unit 108 may use the access point<br>
sleep timer to keep track of 1) how long the access point should remain in sleep<br>
15<br>
mode, and 2) when the access point should enter sleep mode. In another implementation,<br>
the power unit 108 may comprise two separate timers, a first timer for determining when<br>
the access point should enter sleep mode (i.e., the access point sleep timer) and a second<br>
timer for determining when the access point should wake up from sleep mode.<br>
[0049] At stage H, the transceiver unit 104 transmits a beacon on the communication<br>
channel. The access point 102 wakes up from sleep mode, opens access to the<br>
communication channel, and transmits a beacon in time for the connected station 112 to<br>
receive the beacon and maintain connectivity with the access point 102. In transmitting<br>
the beacon, the access point 102 can indicate that the communication channel is available<br>
for contention-based access.<br>
[0050] At stage I, the station 112 wakes up from the sleep mode. In one<br>
implementation, on determining that the station available timer has expired (e.g., counted<br>
down to zero), the power unit can cause the station 112 to wake up from the sleep mode.<br>
The station 112 wakes up from sleep mode in time to receive the beacon transmitted by<br>
the access point (at stage H) and maintain connectivity with the access point 102. The<br>
station 112 can also update the station sleep timer to indicate when the station should<br>
enter the sleep mode again. The station 112 can also transmit data and/or management<br>
information (if any) to the access point 102.<br>
[0051] In one implementation, communication between the access point 102 and the<br>
station 112 may be governed by a set of standards, defined by the Institute of Electrical<br>
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 committee, for Wireless Local Area Network<br>
(WLAN) communication. The IEEE 802.11 standards define frame formats for<br>
transmission of data and management information. It is noted, however, that in other<br>
implementations, the communication between the access point 102 and the station 112<br>
may be governed by other existing or future standards (or amendments to current<br>
standards), e.g., 802.16, or by proprietary protocols implemented by the network<br>
components. Figure 2 illustrates example frame formats for transmission of management<br>
information. Figure 2 illustrates frame formats for a beacon frame 200, a quiet<br>
information element (Quiet I.E) 220, and a probe response frame 240 in accordance<br>
16<br>
with IEEE 802.11 communication standards. An access point (e.g., the access point 102<br>
of Figure 1) can transmit a beacon frame 200 for time synchronization between one or<br>
more connected stations (e.g. station 112 of Figure 1) and the access point 102. The<br>
access point 102 can also use the beacon frame 200 to transmit the access point quiet<br>
information and to inform stations if they are to receive data frames from the access point<br>
102. The beacon frame comprises a beacon header 202 and a beacon payload 220. The<br>
beacon header 202 comprises control information (e.g., frame number) while the beacon<br>
payload can comprises information about the communication channel (e.g., channel<br>
frequency, a service set identifier, data rates supported on the communication channel,<br>
etc.), a beacon interval (i.e., a time period between transmission of beacon frames), etc.<br>
[0052] Additionally, the beacon payload 204 comprises the quiet information element<br>
(Quiet I.E) 220. The access point 102 can use the Quiet I.E 220 to temporarily quiet the<br>
communication channel and enter sleep mode to prolong battery life. The Quiet I.E 220<br>
comprises a Quiet I.E header 222 and a Quiet I.E payload 224. The Quiet I.E payload<br>
224 comprises a Quiet Count 226, a Quiet Period 228, a Quiet Duration 230, and a Quiet<br>
Offset 232. The Quiet Count 226 indicates a number of target beacon transmission time<br>
(TBTT) until the beacon interval during which the quiet interval begins. In other words,<br>
the Quiet Count 226 indicates when the access point will quiet the communication<br>
channel. The Quiet Period 228 indicates a number of beacon intervals between<br>
consecutive quiet intervals (e.g., how often the access point enters sleep mode). The<br>
Quiet Duration 230 indicates a time period for which the access point quiets the<br>
communication channel and enters sleep mode. The Quiet Offset 232 indicates an offset<br>
(if any) after a beacon interval when the next quiet period will begin (e.g., if the Quiet<br>
Duration does not coincide with the start of a beacon interval).<br>
[0053] Additionally, the access point 102 can also transmit the Quiet I.E 220 as part of<br>
the probe response frame 240. The probe response frame 240 comprises a probe<br>
response header 242 and a probe response payload 244. The access point 102 transmits a<br>
probe response frame 240 in response to a probe request frame from the station scanning<br>
the communication channels for existing networks and access points. The probe response<br>
frame 240 comprises information similar to the beacon frame 200. The probe response<br>
17<br>
payload 244 comprises the Quiet I.E 220 along with other information such as channel<br>
frequency, the service set identifier, data rates supported on the communication channel,<br>
etc.<br>
[0054] Figure 3 and Figure 4 depict a flow diagram illustrating example operations for<br>
an access point configuring a quiet interval. Flow 300 begins at block 302 in Figure 3.<br>
[0055] At block 302, a message is received from a station indicating a time interval for<br>
which the station will enter sleep mode (“station sleep interval”). For example, the<br>
station 112 of Figure 1 may indicate, to the access point 102, when and for how long the<br>
station 112 will enter sleep mode. In one implementation, the access point can be mobile<br>
phone acting as an access point. It is noted, however, that in other implementations the<br>
access point can be other types of access points that can operate using either battery<br>
power or an external power source. In one implementation, a station complying with<br>
IEEE 802.11 communication standards may indicate how often the station listens (on the<br>
communication channel) for beacon frames in a Listen Interval in an Association Request<br>
Management Frame. The Listen Interval is typically indicated as a multiple of the<br>
beacon interval. For example, a station with a Listen Interval of 2 will not receive<br>
beacons (i.e., will be in sleep mode) for two beacon intervals. The access point may<br>
receive Association Request Management Frames (or other messages indicating a time<br>
instant and/or the time interval for which the station will be in sleep mode) from one or<br>
more stations connected to or intending to connect to the access point. The flow<br>
continues at block 304.<br>
[0056] At block 304, the message indicating the station sleep interval is analyzed to<br>
determine access point quiet information. For example, the power saving unit 108 in the<br>
access point 102 can analyze the message received (at block 302) to determine the access<br>
point quiet information (e.g., access point sleep interval, when the access point wakes up<br>
from the sleep mode, etc). As described earlier, stations operating in a power save mode<br>
typically go to sleep to conserve power and wakeup only for a predetermined number of<br>
beacon intervals. The access point can use information indicating when and for how long<br>
the station goes to sleep (as indicated, e.g., in the Listen Interval) to determine when<br>
18<br>
and for how long the access point can lock the communication channel and enter a sleep<br>
mode. For example, if a station connected to the access point wakes up every fifth<br>
beacon interval, it may be sufficient for the access point to wakeup just before the start of<br>
the fifth beacon interval and transmit a beacon frame in time for the connected station to<br>
receive the beacon frame. If there are multiple stations connected to the access point, the<br>
access point can calculate a least common factor of the station sleep interval (e.g., the<br>
Listen Interval) associated with each of the connected stations and accordingly determine<br>
when to wake up from sleep mode. For example, if three stations with Listen Intervals 3,<br>
6, and 9 respectively are connected to the access point, then the access point may transmit<br>
a beacon once every three (the least common factor of 3, 6, and 9 is 3) beacon intervals to<br>
ensure that the stations remain connected to the access point. After the access point<br>
determines the access point quiet information, the flow continues at block 306.<br>
[0057] At block 306, a beacon frame comprising the access point quiet information is<br>
generated. For example, the access point 102 may generate the beacon frame. In one<br>
implementation, the beacon frame may be in the format described with reference to<br>
Figure 2 (see beacon frame 200 of Figure 2). The access point may also indicate the<br>
access point quiet information in a probe response frame (e.g., the probe response frame<br>
240 of Figure 2). In another implementation, the access point may notify the stations of<br>
the access point quiet information using other suitable message formats. The flow<br>
continues at block 308.<br>
[0058] At block 308, the beacon frame (generated at block 306) is transmitted on the<br>
communication channel. The beacon frame is transmitted to all the stations listening on<br>
the communication channel. The beacon ensures that stations that are connected to the<br>
access point remain connected to and are in synchronization with the access point. In<br>
transmitting the beacon, the access point can advertise its presence and inform stations<br>
listening on the communication channel of the access point’s capabilities (e.g., access<br>
point identifier, data rates supported, etc). As described earlier, the beacon frame is also<br>
used to transmit the access point quiet information and notify the stations of when and for<br>
how long the communication channel will be quieted. By transmitting the access point<br>
quiet information, the access point can control access to the communication<br>
19<br>
channel during the time the access point is in sleep mode. Thus, the access point can also<br>
control transmissions from the connected stations to the access point. The flow continues<br>
at block 310 in Figure 4 (see connector A).<br>
[0059] At block 310, it is determined whether there exists information to be transmitted<br>
to the connected stations. The access point may access a buffer comprising pending data<br>
frames to be transmitted to determine if there exists data to be transmitted to the<br>
connected stations. In some implementations, the access point may also transmit<br>
management information to connected stations and/or stations that wish to connect to the<br>
access point. For example, the access point may determine that an association response<br>
frame should be transmitted in response to the station transmitting an association request<br>
frame to connect to the access point’s network. If it is determined that there exists<br>
information to be transmitted to the stations, the flow continues at block 320. Otherwise,<br>
the flow continues at block 312.<br>
[0060] At block 320, the information is transmitted to the stations. For example, the<br>
access point 102 may transmit data frames to the connected station 112. In some<br>
implementations, the access point may determine whether there is sufficient time for data<br>
transmission before the stations and the access point enter a sleep mode. In one example,<br>
the access point may access an access point sleep timer and determine the amount of time<br>
remaining until the access point quiets the communication channel and enters the sleep<br>
mode. The access point can calculate the amount of time required for data transmission<br>
based on data rate, frame length, etc. If the access point determines that the stations will<br>
be awake to receive all the data to be transmitted, the access point transmits the data.<br>
Otherwise, the access point can buffer frames destined for the connected stations and<br>
alert the stations (e.g., via a beacon, a traffic indication map (TIM), etc.) when the<br>
stations and the access point wake up from sleep mode. The flow continues at block 312.<br>
[0061] At block 312, it is determined whether a station is transmitting information. The<br>
station (e.g., the station 112) may transmit data or management information to the access<br>
point (e.g., the access point 102). For example, a station connected to the access point<br>
may transmit one or more data frames. As another example, a station connected to the<br>
20<br>
access point may transmit a disassociation frame to the access point to terminate a<br>
connection with the access point. As another example, a station trying to connect to the<br>
access point may transmit a probe request frame to request a connection with the access<br>
point. The stations can transmit data and management information using other suitable<br>
communication protocols. If it is determined that the station is transmitting data, the flow<br>
continues at block 322. Otherwise, the flow continues at block 314.<br>
[0062] At block 322, information is received from the stations. For example, the access<br>
point 102 of may receive data and/or management information from the station 112. The<br>
flow continues at block 314.<br>
[0063] At block 314, it is determined whether the access point should enter the sleep<br>
mode. For example, the power saving unit 108 in the access point 102 may determine<br>
that the access point should enter the sleep mode. As described earlier, the access point<br>
may comprise an access point sleep timer indicating the amount of time that should<br>
elapse before the access point quiets the communication channel and enters sleep mode.<br>
The power saving unit 108 may trigger one or more operating units (e.g., a transceiver<br>
unit, etc.) in the access point to enter the sleep mode when the value of the access point<br>
sleep timer reaches zero. If it determined that the access point should enter sleep mode,<br>
the flow continues at block 316. Otherwise, the flow continues at block 310, where the<br>
access point determines whether there is data to be transmitted to or data to be received<br>
from a station.<br>
[0064] At block 316, the access point enters the sleep mode. For example, the power<br>
saving unit 108 in the access point 102 may direct the transceiver unit 106 and other<br>
processing units 110 in the access point 102 to switch to a low powered state to conserve<br>
battery power. Before the access point enters the sleep mode, the access point also quiets<br>
the communication channel (i.e., locks access to the communication channel). By<br>
locking the communication channel before entering sleep mode, the access point ensures<br>
that stations do not transmit data or management frames to the access point when the<br>
access point is in sleep mode. A timer may also be updated to indicate the time (e.g.,<br>
Quiet Duration 230 of Figure 2) that should elapse before the access point<br>
21<br>
wakes up from sleep mode. From block 416, the flow ends.<br>
[0065] After the access point wakes up from sleep mode, the access point opens the<br>
communication channel for contention-based access and transmits the beacon. The<br>
access point also transmits data and/or management frames that it has for the connected<br>
stations and remains awake for a predetermined time interval to receive any data and/or<br>
management frames from the connected stations or stations that wish to connect to the<br>
access point. The access point then locks access to the communication channel and<br>
enters the sleep mode again.<br>
[0066] The various time intervals associated with the access point configured for<br>
energy conservation are further described using timing diagrams 5A and 5B. Figure 5A<br>
is a timing diagram 500 illustrating transmission operations when no stations are<br>
connected to the access point. Time interval 502 indicates the interval during which the<br>
access point (e.g., access point 102) is awake. Stations (e.g., station 112) can<br>
communicate with the access point during the interval 502. For example, a station may<br>
detect a beacon transmitted by the access point during the time interval 502 and transmit<br>
a probe request frame to request a connection to the access point. Time interval 504<br>
indicates an interval during which the access point is in sleep mode. The sleep mode is a<br>
low power state, which the access point enters to conserve energy and enhance battery<br>
life. The access point transmits a Quiet Information Element (Quiet I.E) in the beacons<br>
or probe response frames (transmitted in response to the probe request frames) during<br>
time interval 502 (i.e., before the access point enters sleep mode). The access point uses<br>
the Quiet I.E to indicate when and for how long the access point will be in sleep mode<br>
(i.e., the time interval 504). In other words, the access point locks the communication<br>
channel for the interval indicated by the time interval 504 and does not receive<br>
communications from or transmit communications to other stations.<br>
[0067] Arrowhead 510 indicates a time instant at which the access point wakes up (e.g.,<br>
just before a predetermined target beacon transmission time (TBTT)) to transmit the<br>
beacon. Arrowhead 512 indicates a time instant at which the Quiet Offset (as indicated in<br>
the Quiet I.E.) begins and the access point enters the sleep mode. Thus, the quiet time<br>
22<br>
interval 504 repeats every beacon interval 508. Because the access point is not connected<br>
to any station, the access point wakes up every beacon interval 508 (which is the sum of<br>
time intervals 502 and 504) to transmit the beacon as depicted by arrowheads 510 and<br>
514. Likewise, the access point enters sleep mode every beacon interval (see arrowheads<br>
512 and 516).<br>
[0068] In one implementation, the access point configures the Quiet I.E frame (see<br>
Quiet I.E frame format 220 in Figure 2) by assigning a Quiet Count 518 of 1 beacon<br>
interval and a Quiet Period of 1 indicating that the quiet period starts at the next TBTT<br>
(denoted by arrowhead 510) and that the quiet period repeats every beacon interval. The<br>
access point can also configure the quiet duration to time interval 504 indicating that the<br>
communication channel should be quiet for the time period indicated by time interval<br>
504. Likewise, the access point can configure the quiet offset to time interval 502<br>
indicating that the quiet period starts after time interval 502.<br>
[0069] Figure 5B is a timing diagram 550 illustrating transmission operations for an<br>
access point connected to a station. In one example, the connected station (e.g., the<br>
station 112) is connected to the access point (e.g., the access point 102) with a Listen<br>
Interval (indicated in an Association Request Management Frame) of two beacon<br>
intervals. The connected station uses the Listen Interval to indicate to the access point<br>
that the station will wake up every second beacon interval to listen for beacons (for<br>
synchronization) from and exchange data and/or management information with the access<br>
point.<br>
[0070] Time interval 552 indicates the interval during which the access point is awake.<br>
The access point and the connected station can exchange data and management frames<br>
during this interval. For example, the connected station may transmit a data frame to the<br>
access point. As another example, the access point can indicate to a station (e.g., by<br>
transmitting a Traffic Indication Map (TIM)) if the access point has data/management<br>
frames for the station. New stations (stations that are not connected to the access point)<br>
can also communicate with the access point during the interval 552. For example, a<br>
station may detect a beacon transmitted by the access point during the time interval<br>
23<br>
552 and transmit a probe request frame to request a connection to the access point. Time<br>
interval 554 indicates an interval during which the access point is in sleep mode.<br>
[0071] With reference to the Quiet I.E. frame structure 220 depicted in Figure 2, the<br>
access point can configure the Quiet I.E frame based on the station’s Listen Interval (two<br>
beacon intervals). The access point can configure the Quiet I.E with a Quiet Count 570<br>
of 1 beacon interval and a Quiet Period 572 of 2 beacon intervals indicating that the quiet<br>
period starts at the next TBTT (see arrowhead 560) and that the quiet period repeats<br>
every second beacon interval (see arrowhead 564). The access point can also configure<br>
the Quiet Duration to time interval 554 indicating that the communication channel should<br>
be quiet for the time period indicated by time interval 554. Likewise, the access point<br>
can configure the Quiet Offset to time interval 552 indicating that the quiet period starts<br>
after time interval 552.<br>
[0072] Arrowhead 560 indicates a time instant at which the access point wakes up (e.g.,<br>
just before the TBTT) to transmit the beacon. Arrowhead 562 indicates a time instant at<br>
which the Quiet Offset (as indicated in the Quiet I.E.) begins and the access point enters<br>
the sleep mode. As depicted by arrowheads 560 and 564, the access point wakes up<br>
every second beacon interval 558 to transmit beacons, probe responses, data frames, etc.<br>
Also, as depicted by arrowheads 562 and 566, the quiet duration 554 repeats every<br>
second beacon interval 558.<br>
[0073] It should be noted that the time intervals during which the access point is awake<br>
and in sleep mode and the beacon interval are configurable. The user can configure any<br>
one or all of the time intervals depending on the type and nature of the traffic that is<br>
estimated to pass through the access point. Additionally, the user may also configure the<br>
access point to dynamically configure the time intervals that the access point is awake<br>
and in sleep mode based on the traffic handled by the access point.<br>
[0074] Figure 6 and Figure 7 depict a flow diagram illustrating example operations for a<br>
station connected to an access point. Flow 600 begins at block 602 in Figure 6.<br>
[0075] At block 602, a time interval for which the station will be in sleep mode is<br>
24<br>
provided to an access point. For example, the station 112 may send a message indicating<br>
to the access point 102 a number of beacon intervals it intends to spend in sleep mode. In<br>
one implementation, the station can indicate a station sleep interval (i.e., the number of<br>
intervals the station will be in sleep mode) by configuring a Listen interval in an<br>
Association Request Management frame. In some implementations, the station sleep<br>
interval may not be described as multiples of the beacon interval. Instead, the station<br>
may use any suitable unit of time (e.g., seconds, milliseconds, etc.) to indicate the station<br>
sleep interval and a time interval at which the station sleep interval repeats (if applicable).<br>
Also, the station may use any suitable message format and/or frame format (agreed upon<br>
by the access point and the station) to communicate with the access point. The flow<br>
continues at block 604.<br>
[0076] At block 604, a beacon comprising access point quiet information is received<br>
from the access point. For example, the station 112 receives a beacon (e.g., the beacon<br>
frame 200 of Figure 2) from the access point 102. As described in Figure 3 (see<br>
discussion for blocks 302 and 304), in one implementation, the access point can receive<br>
Association Request Management frames indicating Listen Intervals from a plurality of<br>
connected stations. The access point can calculate an access point quiet interval from the<br>
received Listen Intervals and transmit the access point quiet interval as part of the quiet<br>
information in a beacon frame. During the access point quiet interval, the access point<br>
can enter the sleep mode and block access to the communication channel. The flow<br>
continues at block 606.<br>
[0077] At block 606, the access point quiet information is retrieved from the beacon<br>
received at block 604. For example, the station 102 may process the received beacon to<br>
extract the access point quiet information. In one implementation, the station may extract<br>
the quiet information element (e.g., the Quiet I.E 220 of Figure 2) from the beacon to<br>
determine when the quiet duration starts, the length of the quiet duration, when data and<br>
management information can be transmitted, etc. The stations can also update a Network<br>
Allocation Vector (NAV) timer with the Quiet Duration (i.e., the Quiet duration 230 of<br>
Figure 2) indicated in the Quiet Information Element. The NAV timers count down so<br>
that the stations wake up in time to receive the beacon transmitted by the access point.<br>
25<br>
In another implementation, the station may retrieve the access point sleep interval from<br>
the access point quiet information (transmitted using any suitable message format and<br>
communication protocol) and accordingly update a station available timer. The flow<br>
continues at block 608.<br>
[0078] At block 608, it is determined whether the communication medium is available.<br>
For example, for contention-based communication channel access, the station 112 may<br>
transmit a request-to-send (RTS) frame on the communication channel to the access point<br>
102 to determine if the communication medium is available. The station may also<br>
indicate an amount of time for which the communication channel will be in use. The<br>
access point may transmit a clear-to-send (CTS) signal to one of the stations contending<br>
for the communication channel to indicate that the communication channel is available<br>
for transmission. Other stations may also receive the RTS/CTS signal and refrain from<br>
accessing the communication channel during the time interval when another station is<br>
transmitting. If it is determined that the communication medium is available for data<br>
transmission, the flow continues at block 610. Otherwise, the flow continues at block<br>
611.<br>
[0079] At block 611, on determining that the communication medium is not available<br>
for transmission, the station waits for a specified period of time. In the contention-based<br>
channel access example described with reference to block 608, other stations that do not<br>
receive permission to transmit along the communication channel also receive the<br>
RTS/CTS frames. The stations can update a timer and wait until the transmitting station<br>
has released the communication channel. In one implementation, the station may wait for<br>
a random amount of time before it senses the communication channel to avoid frame<br>
collision. In another implementation, the station waits for the period of time specified in<br>
an RTS frame transmitted by a station that is currently transmitting. The flow continues<br>
at block 608, where, after the specified period of time, the station senses the<br>
communication channel to determine whether the communication channel is available.<br>
[0080] At block 610, a time period required to transmit information (“transmission<br>
time”) to the access point is calculated. For example, the station 112 may calculate<br>
26<br>
the time period required for transmission of a data/management frame to the access point<br>
102. The transmission time may be calculated based on a number of bytes of data to be<br>
transmitted, frame size, the capacity and data rate of the communication channel, the<br>
network traffic, a network model, etc. The flow continues at block 612 in Figure 7.<br>
[0081] At block 612, it is determined whether the transmission time is greater than the<br>
time to the start of the station sleep interval. In other words, it is determined whether<br>
there is sufficient time to transmit information to the access point before the station enters<br>
a sleep mode. For example, the transmission time may be compared with an amount of<br>
time indicated by a station sleep timer. Stations that are not connected to the access point<br>
may determine whether the transmission time is greater than the time that should elapse<br>
before the access point locks the communication channel and enters a sleep mode. If it is<br>
determined that the time required for data transmission is greater than the time before the<br>
stations enters the sleep mode, the flow continues at block 624. Otherwise, the flow<br>
continues at block 614.<br>
[0082] At block 624, the data is transmitted to the access point. The station connected<br>
to the access point transmits information in response to the station determining that the<br>
transmission time is less than the amount of time that should elapse before the station<br>
enters sleep mode. A station that is not connected to the access point transmit<br>
information to the access point in response to the station determining that the<br>
transmission time is less than the amount of time that should elapse before the access<br>
point quiets the communication channel. The station can transmit a data frame or a<br>
management frame to the access point. For example, a station may transmit a Probe<br>
Request Frame to scan for an existing and compatible access point, a data frame to<br>
transmit data to a second station via the access point, etc.<br>
[0083] At block 614, information is prevented from being transmitted to the access<br>
point. The flow 600 moves from block 612 to block 614 if it is determined that the<br>
transmission time is greater than the time before the station enters the sleep mode. For<br>
example, the station 112 prevents the transmission of data and/or management<br>
information to the access point 102 in response to the station determining that the<br>
27<br>
transmission time is greater than the time before the station enters the sleep mode. The<br>
information to be transmitted may be stored (e.g., in a buffer frame) and may be<br>
transmitted when the station wakes up from the sleep mode. In another implementation,<br>
stations that are not connected to the access point may store information to be transmitted<br>
and may transmit the information (e.g., management frames requesting connectivity)<br>
when the access point wakes up from the sleep mode and opens access to the<br>
communication channel. After the station determines whether it should transmit<br>
information (see block 624) or prevent transmission of the information (see block 614),<br>
the flow continues at block 616.<br>
[0084] At block 616, it is determined whether the station should enter sleep mode. As<br>
described earlier, the stations may update a local timer with the amount of time that<br>
should elapse before the station enters sleep mode. In one implementation, the station<br>
sleep timer may count down, triggering the station to enter sleep mode when the counter<br>
reaches zero. If it is determined that the station should enter sleep mode, the flow<br>
continues at block 626. Otherwise, the flow continues at block 622.<br>
[0085] At block 622, it is determined whether there is any information to be<br>
transmitted. For example, the station 122 may determine whether there exist any data<br>
and/or management frames to be transmitted to the access point 102. If the station<br>
determines that there exists information that should be transmitted to the access point, the<br>
flow continues at block 608 in Figure 6 where the station determines whether the<br>
communication channel is available. Otherwise, the flow continues at block 616 where<br>
the station determines whether it should enter sleep mode.<br>
[0086] At block 626, the station enters sleep mode. As described earlier, the stations<br>
may update a station available timer with the amount of time that the communication<br>
channel is quieted and the access point is in the sleep mode, as indicated by the access<br>
point. In one implementation, the station 112 may update its NAV timer with the Quiet<br>
Duration 230 indicated in the Quiet I.E 220 of Figure 2. As the stations are in the sleep<br>
mode, the NAV timer counts down triggering the stations to wake up when the NAV<br>
timer reaches zero. In some implementations, the stations may use any<br>
28<br>
suitable counter/ timer to indicate when stations can enter or wake up from the sleep<br>
mode. From block 626, the flow ends.<br>
[0087] It should be understood that the depicted flow diagrams (Figures 3, 4, 6, and 7)<br>
and the timing diagram (Figure 5) are examples meant to aid in understanding<br>
embodiments and should not be used to limit embodiments or limit scope of the claims.<br>
Embodiments may perform additional operations, fewer operations, operations in a<br>
different order, operations in parallel, and some operations differently. For example,<br>
Figure 7 describes the station determining whether there is sufficient time for<br>
transmission before the communication channel is quieted (see block 612). However, in<br>
some implementations, the onus to determine whether the station should be allowed to<br>
transmit may be on the access point. For example, the station may transmit an RTS<br>
signal to the access point indicating the frame length, transmission time, etc. The access<br>
point may determine that the transmission time is greater than the time before the access<br>
point quiets the communication channel. The access point may prevent the station from<br>
transmitting information.<br>
[0088] Also, because the access point is awake and can transmit/receive data and/or<br>
management information for only a predefined period of time, there may be a trade-off<br>
between the access point’s performance and power saving for prolonged battery life. In<br>
some implementations, the access point can be configured to operate in full power mode<br>
when one or more stations are connected to the access point. The access point may enter<br>
into power saving mode (i.e., sleep mode) and wake up for a limited time interval when<br>
there are no stations connected to the access point.<br>
[0089] As described above, in some embodiments, the access point is configured to<br>
quiet the communication medium (i.e., the communication channel) by transmitting a<br>
quiet information element (Quiet I.E.) in the beacon frame and/or a probe response frame.<br>
However, in some implementations, the access point and/or one or more of the connected<br>
stations may not support receiving the Quiet I.E. In some implementations, the access<br>
point can quiet the communication channel using a CTS (Clear-to-Send) to self scheme.<br>
The CTS-to-self scheme is a generic scheme that is recognized by all clients (e.g.,<br>
connected stations, transmitting stations, mobile phones, access points, etc.)<br>
29<br>
implementing IEEE 802.11 communication standards. A CTS signal indicates a duration<br>
for which a station is allowed to transmit data on the communication channel. The CTS<br>
signal also indicates, to other stations, the duration for which the communication channel<br>
will be busy and therefore, should not be accessed. The access point can transmit a CTS<br>
signal to itself indicating a time interval for which the communication channel will be<br>
locked (e.g., the Quiet Duration, the access point sleep interval, etc). The CTS signal,<br>
which is also received by other stations, indicates the other stations should not access the<br>
communication channel for the indicated time interval. The access point can enter the<br>
sleep mode on transmitting the CTS signal. This can ensure that no station transmits data<br>
or management frames to the access point while the access point is in the sleep mode.<br>
This also ensures that no data or management information is lost while the access point is<br>
in sleep mode.<br>

[0092] Figure 8 depicts an example wireless device e.g., WLAN device 800. In one<br>
implementation, the WLAN device 800 may be a WLAN station (e.g., station 112 of<br>
Figure 1). In another implementation, the WLAN device 800 may be an access point<br>
operating in an 802.11 WLAN communication environment (e.g., access point 102 of<br>
Figure 1). The WLAN device 800 includes a processor unit 802 (possibly including<br>
multiple processors, multiple cores, multiple nodes, and/or implementing multi-threading,<br>
etc.). The WLAN device 800 includes a memory unit 806. The memory unit 806 may be<br>
system memory (e.g., one or more of cache, SRAM, DRAM, zero capacitor RAM, Twin<br>
Transistor RAM, eDRAM, EDO RAM, DDR RAM, EEPROM, NRAM, RRAM,<br>
SONOS, PRAM, etc.) or any one or more of the above already described possible<br>
realizations of machine-readable media. The WLAN device 800 also includes a bus 810<br>
(e.g., PCI, ISA, PCI-Express, HyperTransport®, InfiniBand®, NuBus, etc.), and network<br>

interface, a Bluetooth® interface, a WiMAX interface, a ZigBee® interface, a Wireless<br>
USB interface, etc.). The WLAN device 800 also includes a power saving unit 808.<br>
31<br>
The power saving unit 808 comprises functionality for conserving power to prolong<br>
battery life in an access point described in accordance with Figures 1-7.<br>
[0093] Any one of the above-described functionalities may be partially (or entirely)<br>
implemented in hardware and/or on the processing unit 802. For example, the<br>
functionality may be implemented with an application specific integrated circuit, in logic<br>
implemented in the processing unit 802, in a co-processor on a peripheral device or card,<br>
etc. Further, realizations may include fewer or additional components not illustrated in<br>
