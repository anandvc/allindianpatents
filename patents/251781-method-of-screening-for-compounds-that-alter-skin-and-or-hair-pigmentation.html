COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10; rule 13)<br>
1. Title of the invention. - "METHOD OF SCREENING FOR COMPOUNDS THAT<br>
ALTER SKIN/AND OR HAIR PIGMENTATION"<br><br><br>
2.	Applicant(s)<br>
(a)	NAME : UNILEVER PLC<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY : A British Company<br>
(c)	ADDRESS : Unilever House, Blackfriars, London EC4P 4BQ,United Kingdom<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The invention relates to methods of identifying compounds having activity in altering skin pigmentation and nucleic 5  acid molecules, polypeptides and cells useful in said methods.<br>
The skin is the largest organ in the body and has roles in thermoregulation, protection from physical and chemical<br>
10  injury, protection from infection and manufacture of Vitamin D.  There is a broad range of skin colours which can be correlated to climates, continents and cultures. Predominantly darker skins are located in hotter climates closer to the equator and are thought to provide protection<br>
15 against UV radiation and the heat. Lighter skins are found in cooler areas where there is less need for UV protection and are also associated with increased vitamin D production<br>
The principal pigments responsible for skin colour are 20  carotene, haemoglobin and in particular melanin.  Melanin is composed of two major sub-types, the darker eumelanin and lighter pheomelanin.  Melanin is synthesised by melanocytes, and combined with other proteins into granules which are then redistributed to keratinocytes.  The amount of melanin 25  is influenced by exposure to UV radiation (tanning) and a darker skin can therefore be achieved by increasing the amount of melanin in the skin.<br>
The genetic basis for constitutive and induced skin and hair 30  pigmentation is not yet fully understood and it is<br>
hypothesised that a plurality of genes are involved in<br><br>
pigmentation. Different variants of these genes influence the skin colour phenotype of an individual before external factors such as sunlight influence skin colour.<br>
5  Summary of the Invention<br>
In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of identifying compounds that either increase or decrease skin and/or hair pigmentation or change the melanin 10  composition of skin and/or hair, the method comprising<br>
determining the ability of a test compound to modulate NCKX-mediated calcium ion movement across a membrane.<br>
    The NCKX molecule may be derived from any species, in<br>
15  particular mammals and most preferably humans.  Examples of NCKX molecules are NCKX1 (gene accession no. NM_004727, protein accession no. - NP_004718) ; NCKX2 gene accession no. NM_020344, protein accession no. NP_065077); NCKX3 (gene accession no. NM_020689, protein accession no. NP_065740);<br>
20  NCKX4 (gene accession nos. NM_153648, NM_153646, NM_153647; protein accession nos. NP_705934, NP_705932, NP_705933); NCKX5 (see figure 1 for sequence and gene accession nos. NM_205850 XM_208771, protein accession nos. NP_995322 XP_208771) and NCKX6 (gene accession no. NM_024959, protein<br>
25  accession no. NP_079235 ).  (See Cai &amp; Lytton (2004) Mol Biol &amp; Evolution vol 21 no9 pgl692-1703 and Schnetkamp (2004) Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol vol 447 pg 683-688)<br>
Preferably the NCKX molecule is NCKX5, NCKX5 is also known 30  as SLC24A5.<br><br>
Preferably the method comprises the steps of exposing a membrane comprising a NCKX molecule or variant, fusion or derivative thereof to a test compound and measuring either directly or indirectly the calcium ion concentration on one 5  or both sides of the membrane.<br>
The method of the invention may comprise the steps of:<br>
(a)	providing a membrane comprising at least one NCKX<br>
10           molecule or functionally equivalent variants,<br>
fusions or derivatives thereof, wherein said membrane separates two distinct compartments;<br>
(b)	measuring the Calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration in<br>
15           one or both compartments before exposure to one or<br>
more test compounds;<br>
(c)	exposing the membrane to one or more test<br>
compounds;<br>
20<br>
(d)	measuring the Calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration in<br>
one or both compartments after exposure to one or<br>
more test compounds;<br>
25       (e)  identifying the amount of Calcium ion (Ca2+)<br>
movement across the membrane by comparing the concentrations measured in step (b) and step (d);<br>
The method of the invention may also further comprise 30  comparing the calcium movement in response to a test<br>
compound with a control value.  Such a comparison may be<br><br>
achieved using the following steps:<br>
(f)	repeating the above steps (a), (b), (d) and (e) to<br>
provide a control result for the change in the<br>
5	Calcium ion (Ca ) concentration without exposure<br>
to one or more test compounds;<br>
(g)	comparing the amount of Calcium ion (Ca2+) movement<br>
across the membrane identified in step (e) after<br>
10	exposure to the test compound, amount of Calcium<br>
ion (Ca2+) movement across the membrane in the control  of step (f)<br>
(h)  identifying whether the amount-of Calcium ion<br>
15	(Ca2+) movement across the membrane has increased,<br>
decreased or stayed the same in-response to exposure to the test compound(s).<br>
An alternative control method would be to compare the amount 20  of Calcium ion movement across a control membrane which does not contain a NCKX protein.<br>
NCKX5 (also known as SLC24A5) is a member of the Sodium, Calcium/Potassium exchanger family (NCKX) and has been found 25  to influence pigmentation in Zebrafish.  In the Zebrafish a mutation in NCKX5 exhibits a reduction in pigmentation associated with the "golden" mutation (Lamason (2005) Science 310 ppl782-1786) .<br>
30  Studies of other Sodium-Calcium exchangers have been conducted and shown that NCKX1 and NCKX2, for example,<br><br>
exhibit calcium exchange functions in human photoreceptors, bovine heart muscle (Winkfein (2003) Biochemistry 42 pp543-552 and Schnetkamp (1996) Biochem. Cell. Biol, 74 pp535-539) and arterial smooth muscle Epublication: Doug (2006) 5  American Journal Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol (April 14th 2 00 6) doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00196.2006.<br>
The applicant has now shown that NCKX5 is associated with sodium-potassium/calcium exchange function in melanocytes<br>
10  and that this function is closely correlated to skin<br>
pigmentation.  In addition, the applicant has shown that NCKX5  exists in two allelic forms at amino acid 111  due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).  The Alalll version is correlated with increased calcium movement and is found<br>
15  predominantly in dark skin.  The Thrill version is closely correlated to decreased calcium movement and is found predominantly in lighter skin.  (See examples 1 and 2).<br>
The sequence of NCKX5 including the position of the SNP is 20  shown in figure 1.<br>
Preferably, an increase in the amount of Calcium ion (Ca2+) movement across the membrane indicates the test compound(s) increase skin pigmentation and a decrease in the amount of 25  Calcium ion (Ca2+) movement across the membrane indicates the test compound(s) decrease skin pigmentation.<br>
Optionally, the method of the invention further comprises the step of: 30<br>
(i)  isolating the one or more test compounds.<br><br>
Further optionally, the method comprises the step of:<br>
(j)  formulating the one or more test compounds<br>
isolated in step (i) into a cosmetic or<br>
5	pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
Conveniently, the membrane is a biological membrane, such as a cell membrane that is preferably part of an intact cell.<br>
10  Preferred sources of cell membranes and/or intact cells are Hamster Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells. High five insect cells, yeast cells, dictyostelium cells, tobacco plant cells, p53 deficient cell line H1299 and/or bacteria.<br>
15  Advantageously, the NCKX5 molecule is located in the membrane naturally or is artificially targeted to the membrane or is reconstituted into an artificial membrane.<br>
Preferably when the NCKX5 is artificially targeted to the 20  membrane it is done by linking a leader sequence and/or tag that targets polypeptides to and for inclusion in a membrane or by deletion of internal compartment retention signals, such as ArgArg motifs.<br>
25  Conveniently, the leader sequence is derived from NCKX2 or 4, yeast a mating factor, NCX proteins, TGFbeta, haemagglutinin or viral surface proteins.<br>
Preferably the leader sequence is the N terminal sequence of 30  hsNCKX2 (amino acids 1 to 120).<br><br>
Advantageously, the calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration and/or movement is measured using a method selected from Ca2+ sensitive dyes (fluorescent and/or non-fluorescent), electrophysiological methods (e.g. patch clamp), radioactive 5  Calcium (45Ca2+) or conventional mass spectrometry.<br>
Preferably, the NCKX5 molecule or functionally equivalent<br>
variant, fusion or derivative thereof possesses a single<br>
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the codon for amino acid<br>
\ 10  residue 111. The SNP at the codon for amino acid residue 111<br>
can code for either Alanine or Threonine (DVAGA/TTFMAAG)<br>
(see figure 3).<br>
The method may also include the step of testing the 15  selectivity of the test compound (i.e does it affect any<br>
other ion channels) by using broadly known techniques such as electrophysiological methods such as patch clamping.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention there is a nucleic acid 20  molecule encoding a fusion protein comprising the nucleic acid molecule encoding NCKX molecule or a functionally equivalent variant, fusion or derivative thereof and a nucleic acid molecule encoding a membrane targeting leader peptide and/or tag. 25<br>
The chimeric nucleic acid molecule may encode a chimera comprising the N terminus of NCK2 and NCKX5 from 151 toend; or  N-terminus l-200amino acids of NCKX4 and NCKX5 from 151 to end. Alternatively the cimera may include the C terminus 30  of NCKX2 (11 amino acids) instead of the final 11 amino acids of NCKX5.<br><br>
Preferably, the membrane targeting leader peptide and/or tag is derived from NCKX2 or 4, yeast a mating factor, NCX proteins, TGFbeta, haemagglutinin or viral surface proteins.<br>
5  Most preferably the leader sequence is the N terminal sequence of hsNCKX2 (amino acids 1 to 120).<br>
Advantageously, the nucleic acid molecule encoding the NCKX molecule or a functionally equivalent variant, fusion or 10  derivative thereof includesa single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the codon for amino acid residue 111. The SNP at amino acid residue 111 can code for either Alanine or Threonine.<br>
15  Thus, the 'isolated nucleic acid molecule is suitable for<br>
expressing a polypeptide of the invention.  By 'suitable for expressing' is meant that the nucleic acid molecule is a polynucleotide that may be translated to form the polypeptide, for example RNA, or that the polynucleotide<br>
20   (which is preferably DNA) encoding the polypeptide of the invention is inserted into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, in proper orientation and correct reading frame for expression.  The polynucleotide may be linked to the appropriate transcriptional and translational regulatory<br>
25  control nucleotide sequences recognised by any desired host; such controls may be incorporated in the expression vector.<br>
The nucleic acid molecule of the invention may be DNA or RNA, preferably DNA.<br><br>
The DNA is then expressed in a suitable host to produce a polypeptide comprising the compound of the invention.  Thus, the DNA encoding the polypeptide constituting the compound of the invention may be used in accordance with known 5  techniques, appropriately modified in view of the teachings contained herein, to construct an expression vector, which is then used to transform an appropriate host cell for the expression and production of the polypeptide of the invention.  Such techniques include those disclosed in US<br>

Toole, Jr. et  al,   4,766,075 issued 23 August 1988 to Goeddel et al  and 4,810,648 issued 7 March 1989 to Stalker, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
20  Hence, in a third aspect of the invention there is provided an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule of the second aspect of the invention.<br>
The DNA encoding the polypeptide constituting the compound of 25  the invention may be joined to a wide variety of other DNA sequences for introduction into an appropriate host.  The companion DNA will depend upon the nature of the host, the manner of the introduction of the DNA into the host, and whether episomal maintenance or integration is desired.<br><br>
The DNA is inserted into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, in proper orientation and correct reading frame for expression. If  necessary,   the DNA may be  linked to the appropriate transcriptional and translational regulatory 5  control nucleotide sequences recognised by the desired host, although such controls are generally available in the expression vector.  Thus, the DNA insert may be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter. Bacterial promoters include the E.coli lacl  and lacZ  promoters, the T3 and T7<br>
10  promoters, the gpt  promoter, the phage X  PR and PL promoters, the phoA  promoter and the trp  promoter. Eukaryotic promoters include the CMV immediate early promoter, the HSV thymidine kinase promoter, the early and late SV40 promoters and the promoters of retroviral LTRs. Other suitable promoters will<br>
15  be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will desirably also contain sites for transcription initiation and termination, and in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. (Hastings et alr International Patent No. WO 98/16643, published 23 April<br>
20  1998)<br>
Many expression systems are known, including systems employing: bacteria (e.g. E.coli  and Bacillus subtilis) transformed with, for example, recombinant bacteriophage,<br>
25  plasmid or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeasts (e.g.<br>
Saccaromyces  cerevisiae)   transformed with, for example, yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems transformed with, for example, viral expression vectors (e.g. baculovirus) ; plant cell systems transfected with, for example viral or bacterial<br>
30  expression vectors; animal cell systems transfected with, for example, adenovirus expression vectors.<br><br>
The vectors can include a prokaryotic replicon, such as the Col El ori,   for propagation in a prokaryote, even if the vector is to be used for expression in other, non-prokaryotic 5  cell types. The vectors can also include an appropriate<br>
promoter such as a prokaryotic promoter capable of directing the expression (transcription and translation) of the genes in a bacterial host cell, such as E.coli,   transformed therewith.<br>
10<br>
A promoter is an expression control element formed by a DNA sequence that permits binding of RNA polymerase and transcription to occur. Promoter sequences compatible with exemplary bacterial hosts are typically provided in plasmid<br>
15  vectors containing convenient restriction sites for insertion of a DNA segment of the present invention.<br>
Typical prokaryotic vector plasmids are: pUC18, pUC19, pBR322 and pBR329 available from Biorad Laboratories (Richmond, CA, USA); pTrc99A, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540 and pRIT5 available<br>
20  from Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ, USA); pBS vectors,<br>
Phagescript vectors, Bluescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16A, pNH18A, pNH4 6A available from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA 92037, USA).<br>
25  A typical mammalian cell vector plasmid is pSVL available from Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ, USA). This vector uses the SV40 late promoter to drive expression of cloned genes, the highest level of expression being found in T antigen-producing cells, such as COS-1 cells. An example of an<br>
30  inducible mammalian expression vector is pMSG, also available from Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ, USA).  This vector uses the<br><br>
glucocorticoid-inducible promoter of the mouse mammary tumour virus long terminal repeat to drive expression of the cloned gene.<br>
5  Preferred vectors are piEI/153A (available from Cytostore) and pcDNA3.1 (available from Invitrogen.  The maps of these vectors are given in figures 6 and 7.<br>
Useful yeast plasmid vectors are pRS403-406 and pRS413-416 10  and are generally available from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA 92037, USA).  Plasmids pRS403, pRS404, pRS405 and pRS406 are Yeast Integrating plasmids (YIps) and incorporate the yeast selectable markers HIS3,   TRP1,   LEU2  and URA3.     Plasmids pRS413-416 are Yeast Centromere plasmids 15  (YCps).<br>
Methods well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequence and, for example appropriate transcriptional or translational<br>
20  controls. One such method involves ligation via homopolymer tails. Homopolymer polydA (or polydC) tails are added to exposed 3' OH groups on the DNA fragment to be cloned by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferases. The fragment is then capable of annealing to the polydT (or polydG)  tails added<br>
25  to the ends of a linearised plasmid vector. Gaps left<br>
following annealing can be filled by DNA polymerase and the free ends joined by DNA ligase.<br>
Another method involves ligation via cohesive ends. 30  Compatible cohesive ends can be generated on the DNA fragment and vector by the action of suitable restriction enzymes.<br><br>
These ends will rapidly anneal through complementary base pairing and remaining nicks can be closed by the action of DNA ligase.<br>
5  A further method uses synthetic molecules called linkers and adaptors. DNA fragments with blunt ends are generated by bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase or E.coli  DNA polymerase I which remove protruding 3' termini and fill in recessed 3' ends. Synthetic linkers, pieces of blunt-ended double-<br>
10  stranded DNA which contain recognition sequences for defined restriction enzymes, can be ligated to blunt-ended DNA fragments by T4 DNA ligase. They are subsequently digested with appropriate restriction enzymes to create cohesive ends   and ligated to an expression vector with compatible termini..<br>
15  Adaptors are also chemically synthesised DNA fragments which contain one blunt end used for ligation but which also possess one preformed cohesive end.<br>
Synthetic linkers containing a variety of restriction<br>
20  endonuclease sites are commercially available from a number<br><br>
of sources including International Biotechnologies Inc, New Haven, CN, USA.<br>
A desirable way to modify the DNA encoding the polypeptide of 25  the invention is to use the polymerase chain reaction as<br>
disclosed by Saiki et  al   (1988) Science  239, 487-491. In this method the DNA to be enzymatically amplified is flanked by two specific oligonucleotide primers which themselves become incorporated into the amplified DNA.  The said specific 30  primers may contain restriction endonuclease recognition<br><br>
sites which can be used for cloning into expression vectors using methods known in the art.<br>
Exemplary genera of yeast contemplated to be useful in the 5  practice of the present invention are Pichia   {Hansenula), Saccharomyces,   Kluyveromyces,   Candida,   Torulopsis, Torulaspora,   Schizosaccharomyces,   Citeromyces,   Pachysolen, Debaromyces,  Metschunikowia,  Rhodosporidium,   Leucosporidium, Botryoascus, Sporidiobolus, Endomycopsis,   and the like.<br>
10  Preferred genera are those selected from the group consisting of Pichia   (Hansenula),   Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces,   Yarrowia  and Hansenula.     Examples of Saccharomyces  spp. are S.   cerevisiae,   S.   italicus  and S. rouxii.     Examples of Kluyveromyces  spp. are K.   fragilis  and<br>
15 K.   lactis.     Examples of Pichia   (Hansenula)   are P.   angusta (formerly H.   polymorpha),   P.   anomala,   P.   pastoris  and P. capsulata.     Y.   lipolytica  is an example of a suitable Yarrowia  species.<br>
20  Methods for the transformation of S.   cerevisiae  are taught generally in EP 251 744, EP 258 067 and WO 90/01063, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable promoters for S.   cerevisiae  include those 25  associated with the PGKl   gene, GALl   or GALIO  genes, CYCl, PH05,    TRP1,   ADH1,   ADH2,   the genes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, triose phosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, glucokinase, a-mating factor 30  pheromone, a-mating factor pheromone, the PRBl   promoter, the GUT2  promoter, and hybrid promoters involving hybrids of<br><br>
parts of 5' regulatory regions with parts of 5' regulatory regions of other promoters or with upstream activation sites (e.g. the promoter of EP-A-258 067).<br>
5  Convenient regulatable promoters for use in<br>
Schizosaccharomyces pombe  are the thiamine-repressible promoter from the nmt  gene as described by Maundrell (1990) J.   Biol.   Chem.   265, 10857-10864 and the glucose-repressible fbp1  gene promoter as described by Hoffman &amp; Winston (1990) 10 Genetics  124, 807-816.<br>
The transcription termination signal is preferably the 3' flanking sequence of a eukaryotic gene which contains proper signals for transcription termination and polyadenylation.<br>
15  Suitable 3' flanking sequences may, for example, be those of the gene naturally linked to the expression control sequence used, i.e. may correspond to the promoter.  Alternatively, they may be different in which case the termination signal of the S.   cerevisiae ADH1   gene is preferred.<br>

In a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a host cell containing a nucleic acid molecule and/or an expression vector of the second and third aspects of the invention.<br>
25  Preferably the host cell further displays at its surface,<br>
the polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid molecule and/or an expression vector of the second and third aspects of the invention.<br>
30  Host cells that have been transformed by the recombinant DNA of the invention are then cultured for a sufficient time and<br><br>
under appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings disclosed herein to permit the expression of the polypeptide, which can then be recovered either as soluble polypeptides or as part of a membrane. 5<br>
The present invention also relates to a host cell transformed with a polynucleotide vector construct of the present invention.  The host cell can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic.  Bacterial cells are preferred prokaryotic host<br>
10  cells and typically are a strain of E.   coli  such as, for example, the E.   coli  strains DH5 available from Bethesda Research Laboratories Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA, and RR1 available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) of Rockville, MD, USA (No ATCC 31343).<br>
15<br>
Preferred eukaryotic host cells include yeast and mammalian cells, preferably vertebrate cells such as those from a mouse, rat, monkey or human fibroblastic cell line.  Yeast host cells include YPH499, YPH500 and YPH501 which are<br>
20  generally available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.<br>
Possible mammalian host cells include Hamster Embryonic Kidney cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells available 25  from the ATCC as  CCL61,   NIH Swiss mouse embryo cells NIH/3T3 available from the ATCC as CRL 1658, and monkey kidney-derived COS-1 cells available from the ATCC as CRL 1650. Possible insect cells are high five and Sf9 cells which can be transfected with baculovirus expression vectors.<br><br>
Transformation of appropriate cell hosts with a DNA construct of the present invention is accomplished by well known methods that typically depend on the type of vector used. With regard to transformation of prokaryotic host cells, see, 5  for example, Cohen et al   (1972) Proc.   Natl.   Acad.   Sci.   USA 69, 2110 and Sambrook et al   (2001) Molecular Cloning,  A Laboratory Manual,   3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.  Transformation of yeast cells is described in Sherman et al   (1986) Methods  In  Yeast  Genetics,<br>
10 A Laboratory Manual,   Cold Spring Harbor, NY.  The method of Beggs (1978) Nature  275, 104-109 is also useful.  With regard to vertebrate cells, reagents useful in transfecting such cells, for example calcium phosphate and DEAE-dextran or liposome formulations, are available from Stratagene Cloning<br>
15  Systems, or Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD 20877, USA.<br>
Electroporation is also useful for transforming cells and is<br>
well known in the art for transforming yeast cell, bacterial<br>
20  cells and vertebrate cells.<br>
{<br>
For example, many bacterial species may be transformed by the methods described in Luchansky et al   (1988) Mol.   Microbiol. 2,   637-64 6 incorporated herein by reference.  The greatest 25  number of transformants is consistently recovered following<br>
electroporation of the DNA-cell mixture suspended in 2.5X PEB using 6250V per cm at 25uFD.<br>
Methods for transformation of yeast by electroporation are 30  disclosed in Becker &amp; Guarente (1990) Methods Enzymol.   194, 182.<br><br>
Physical methods may be used for introducing DNA into animal and plant cells. For example, microinjection uses a very fine pipette to inject DNA molecules directly into the nucleus of the cells to be transformed. Another example 5  involves bombardment of the cells with high-velocity<br>
microprojectiles, usually particles of gold or tungsten that have been coated with DNA.<br>
Successfully transformed cells, i.e.. cells that contain a 10  DNA construct of the present invention, can be identified by well known techniques. For example, one selection technique involves incorporating into the expression vector a DNA sequence (marker) that codes for a selectable trait in the transformed cell. These markers include dihydrofolate 15  reductase, G418 or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell<br>
culture, and tetracyclin, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in E.coli  and other bacteria. Alternatively, the gene for such selectable trait can be on another vector, which is used to co-transform the desired 20  host cell.<br>
The marker gene can be used to identify transformants but it is desirable to determine which of the cells contain recombinant DNA molecules and which contain self-ligated 25      vector molecules.   This  can  be achieved by using a  cloning vector where insertion of a DNA fragment destroys the integrity of one of the genes present on the molecule. Recombinants can therefore be identified because of loss of function of that gene.<br><br>
Another method of identifying successfully transformed cells involves growing the cells resulting from the introduction of an expression construct of the present invention to produce the polypeptide of the invention.  Cells can be harvested and 5  lysed and their DNA content examined for the presence of the DNA using a method such as that described by Southern (1975) J.   Mol.   Biol.   98, 503 or Berent et al   (1985) Biotech.   3, 208. Alternatively, successful transformation can be confirmed by well known immunological methods when the recombinant DNA is 10  capable of directing the expression of the protein.  For example, cells successfully transformed with an expression vector produce proteins displaying appropriate calcium exchange function.<br>
15  In a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>
polypeptide comprising a polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid molecule of the second aspect of the invention.<br>
As discussed above, the peptide/polypeptide can be expressed 20  from the encoding nucleic acid molecule using expression<br>
vectors in host cells.  An alternative method of producing peptides is chemical synthesis.<br>
Peptides may be synthesised by the Fmoc-polyamide mode of 25  solid-phase peptide synthesis as disclosed by Lu et al (1981) J.   Org.   Chem.   46, 3433 and references therein. Temporary N-amino group protection is afforded by the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group.  Repetitive cleavage of this highly base-labile protecting group is effected using 30  20% piperidine in N,N-dimethyl formamide.  Side-chain<br>
functionalities may be protected as their butyl ethers (in<br><br>
the case of serine threonine and tyrosine), butyl esters (in the case of glutamic acid and aspartic acid), butyloxycarbonyl derivative (in the case of lysine and histidine), trityl derivative (in the case of cysteine) and 5  4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulphonyl derivative (in the case of arginine).  Where glutamine or asparagine are C-terminal residues, use is made of the 4,4'-dimethoxybenzhydryl group for protection of the side chain amido functionalities.<br>
10<br>
The solid-phase support is based on a polydimethyl-acrylamide polymer constituted from the three monomers dimethylacrylamide (backbone-monomer), bisacryloylethylene diamine (cross linker) and acryloylsarcosine methyl ester.<br>
15   (functionalising agent).  The peptide-to-resin cleavable linked agent used is the acid-labile 4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxyacetic acid derivative.<br>
All amino acid derivatives are added as their preformed 20  symmetrical anhydride derivatives with the exception of<br>
asparagine and glutamine, which are added using a reversed N,N-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide/l-hydroxybenzotriazole mediated coupling procedure.  All coupling and deprotection reactions are monitored using ninhydrin, trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid 25  or isotin test procedures.<br>
Upon completion of synthesis, peptides are cleaved from the resin support with concomitant removal of side-chain protecting groups by treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid 30  containing a 50% scavenger mix.  Scavengers commonly used are ethanedithiol, phenol, anisole and water, the exact choice<br><br>
depending on the constituent amino acids of the peptide being synthesised.  Trifluoroacetic acid is removed by evaporation in   vacuo,   with subsequent trituration with diethyl ether affording the crude peptide.  Any scavengers present are 5  removed by a simple extraction procedure which on<br>
lyophilisation of the aqueous phase affords the crude peptide free of scavengers.<br>
Reagents for peptide synthesis are generally available from 10  Merck/Calbiochem-Novabiochem (UK) Ltd, Nottingham, UK.<br>
Purification may be effected by any one, or a combination of, techniques such as size exclusion  chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography and (principally) reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography.  Analysis of peptides may 15  be carried out using thin layer chromatography, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, amino-acid analysis after acid hydrolysis and by fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometric analysis.<br>
20  In a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a kit of parts comprising:<br>
(i)  at least one membrane including at least one<br>
polypeptide as defined in the fifth aspect of<br>
25	the invention and/or at least one cell<br>
displaying at its surface at least one polypeptide as defined in the fifth aspect of the invention;<br>
30	(ii) either a solid support to which the at least<br>
one membrane and/or the at least one cell may<br><br>
be fixed, or a solution which the at least one membrane and/or the at least one cell may be suspended;<br>
5	(iii)     a multi-welled plate;<br>
(iv) a calcium sensitive detection system (e.g. dye)  and<br>
10	(v)  instructions on using the kit<br>
In a seventh aspect of the invention there is provided a use of the compounds isolated in step (i) of the first aspect of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the 15 treatment of disease characterised by excessive pigmentation and/or reduced pigmentation and/or in the prevention of sun-induced skin damage.<br>
Preferably the compounds that increase calcium movement can 20  be used in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of disease characterised by reduced pigmentation and/or for the prevention of sun-induced skin damage.<br>
Alternatively the compounds that reduce calcium movement can 25  be used in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of disease characterised by elevated pigmentation.<br>
In an eighth aspect of the invention there is provided a use of the compounds isolated in step (i) of the first aspect of 30  the invention in the manufacture of a cosmetic product for increasing and/or reducing skin pigmentation.<br><br>
Preferably the compounds that increase calcium movement can be used in the manufacture of a cosmetic product for increasing skin pigmentation. 5<br>
Alternatively the compounds that reduce calcium movement can be used in the manufacture of a cosmetic product for reducing skin pigmentation.<br>
10  Uses of the compounds identified and isolated using the<br>
methods of the invention may be as inhibitors or activators of NCKX5   function.<br>
Inhibitors of NCKX5 can be used as pigmentation inhibitors, 15  for example in darker skin, inhibition of the exchanger will reduce pigment production and lighten the skin, which is desirable in certain Asian societies.  Such inhibitors may also enhance UV dependent vitamin D synthesis in skin as a reduction in melanin will reduce melanin-induced blockage of 20  the UV dependent synthesis of vitamin D in skin which has<br>
general health benefits including on bone e.g. in improving and/or preventing osteoporosis benefits over time.<br>
Conversely, ingredients that activate the exchanger can be 25  used to enhance pigment production in skin.   For example, consumers with lighter skin may obtain a natural tan with out the risks that arise from sun exposure (such as burning and the discomfort associated with that, skin ageing and skin cancer).  The activators might also use a tanning 30  product to prepare the skin for subsequent sun exposure, a so-called pre-sun treatment.    Use of such a tanning<br><br>
product may reduce the effects over time of photoageing, and therefore indirectly will have a skin ageing benefit.  For example wrinkles, sallowness, sagging, fine lines, age spots, mottled pigmentation could be reduced.   Individuals 5  who are especially sensitive to UV and/or visible light, may use a tanning product to better protect themselves from sun exposure when they go outside; for example patients with porphyria or xeroderma pigmentosum.<br>
10  The protection of such activators may extend to individuals for which sun exposure is contra-indicated e.g. those who are especially  sensitive to skin  cancer,   for example because of defective DNA repair mechanisms or phototoxic reactions.<br>
15  Inhibitors and activators of SLC24A5 might also be used to change the pigmentation or composition of skin and/or hair melanin so that the skin and/or hair colour is altered.<br>
Inhibitors and activators of SLC24A5  might also be used to 20  change the pigmentation in animals so that the coat or skin colour of the animal is lightened or darkened.  The uses of pigmentation changes in animals may range from protection of animals against sunburn to altering skin pigmentation for textiles such as leather. 25<br>
In a ninth aspect of the invention there is provided a compound identified by the method of the first aspect of the invention.<br><br>
Meanings of terms used<br>
The terms "nucleotide sequence" or "nucleic acid" or "polynucleotide" or "oligonucleotide" are used 5  interchangeably and refer to a heteropolymer of nucleotides or the sequence of these nucleotides.  These phrases also refer to DNA or RNA of genomic or synthetic origin which may be single-stranded or double-stranded and may represent the sense or the antisense strand, to peptide nucleic acid (PNA)<br>
10  or to any DNA-like or RNA-like material.  In the sequences herein A is adenine, C is cytosine, T is thymine, G is guanine and N is A, C, G or T (U).  It is contemplated that where the polynucleotide is RNA, the T (thymine) in the sequences provided herein is substituted with U (uracil).<br>
15  Generally, nucleic acid segments provided by this invention may be assembled from fragments of the genome and short oligonucleotide linkers, or from a series of<br>
oligonucleotides, or from individual nucleotides, to provide a synthetic nucleic acid which is capable of being expressed<br>
20  in a recombinant transcriptional unit comprising regulatory elements derived from a microbial or viral operon, or a eukaryotic gene.<br>
The terms "polypeptide" or "peptide" or "amino acid 25  sequence" refer to an oligopeptide, peptide, polypeptide or protein sequence or fragment thereof and to naturally occurring or synthetic molecules. A polypeptide "fragment," "portion," or "segment" is a stretch of amino acid residues of at least about 5 amino acids, preferably at least about 7 30  amino acids, more preferably at least about 9 amino acids and most preferably at least about 17 or more amino acids.<br><br>
To be active, any polypeptide must have sufficient length to display biological and/or immunological activity.<br>
The term "functionally equivalent variants" as used herein 5  refers to a protein wherein at one or more positions there have been amino acid insertions, deletions, or substitutions, either conservative or non-conservative, provided that such changes result in a protein whose basic properties, for example enzymatic activity (type of and specific activity),<br>
10  thermostability, activity in a certain pH-range (pH-stability) have not significantly been changed. "Significantly" in this context means that one skilled in the art would say that the properties of the variant may still be different  but would not be unobvious over the ones of the<br>
15  original protein.<br>
By "conservative substitutions" is intended combinations such as Gly, Ala; Val, Ile, Leu; Asp, Glu; Asn, Gln; Ser, Thr; Lys, Arg; and Phe, Tyr.<br>
20<br>
Functionally equivalent variants can refer both to nucleotide and amino acid sequences, for example a mutant sequence, that varies from a reference sequence by one or more substitutions, deletions, or additions, the net effect<br>
25  of which does not result in an adverse functional<br>
dissimilarity between the reference and subject sequences. Typically, such a substantially equivalent sequence varies from one of those listed herein by no more than about 35% (i.e., the number of individual residue substitutions,<br>
30  additions, and/or deletions in a substantially equivalent sequence, as compared to the corresponding reference<br><br>
sequence, divided by the total number of residues in the substantially equivalent sequence is about 0.35 or less). Such a sequence is said to have 65% seguence identity to the listed sequence.  In one embodiment, a substantially 5  equivalent, e.g., mutant, sequence of the invention varies from a listed sequence by no more than 30% (70% sequence identity); in a variation of this embodiment, by no more than 25% (75% sequence identity); and in a further variation of this embodiment, by no more than 20% (80% sequence<br>
10  identity) and in a further variation of this embodiment, by no more than 10% (90% sequence identity) and in a further variation of this embodiment, by no more that 5% (95% sequence identity).  Substantially equivalent, e.g., mutant, amino acid sequences according to the invention preferably<br>
15  have at least 80% sequence identity with a listed amino acid sequence, more preferably at least 85% sequence identity, more preferably at least 90% sequence identity, more preferably at least 95% sequence identity, more preferably at least 98% sequence identity, and most preferably at least<br>
20  99% sequence identity.  Substantially equivalent nucleic acid molecule of the invention can have lower percent sequence identities, taking into account, for example, the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code.  Preferably, the nucleic acid molecule has at least about 65% identity,<br>
25  more preferably at least about 75% identity, more preferably at least about 80% sequence identity, more preferably at least 85% sequence identity, more preferably at least 90% sequence identity, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity, more preferably at least 98% sequence<br>
30  identity, and most preferably at least 99% sequence identity.  For the purposes of the present invention,<br><br>
sequences having substantially equivalent biological activity and substantially equivalent expression characteristics are considered substantially equivalent.<br>
The percent sequence identity between two polypeptides may be determined using suitable computer programs, for example the GAP program of the University of Wisconsin Genetic Computing Group and it will be appreciated that percent identity is calculated in relation to polypeptides whose sequence has been aligned optimally.<br>
The alignment may alternatively be carried out using the Clustal W program (Thompson et al.,    (1994) Nucleic Acids Res 22, 4673-80).  The parameters used may be as follows: Fast pairwise alignment parameters: K-tuple (word) size;!,-window size; 5, gap penalty; 3, number of top diagonals; 5. Scoring method: x percent.<br>
Multiple alignment parameters: gap open penalty; 10, gap extension penalty; 0.05. Scoring matrix: BLOSUM.<br>
The term "functionally equivalent fusions" as used herein denotes a polypeptide of the invention operatively linked to another polypeptide.  Within a fusion protein the polypeptide according to the invention can correspond to all or a portion of a protein according to the invention.  In one embodiment, a fusion protein comprises at least one biologically active portion of a protein according to the invention.  In another embodiment, a fusion protein comprises at least two biologically active portions of a protein according to the invention.  Within the fusion<br><br>
protein, the term "operatively linked" is intended to indicate that the polypeptide according to the invention and the other polypeptide are fused in-frame to each other.  The polypeptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus, or 5  to the middle.  The basic properties of the polypeptide of the invention have not significantly been changed. "Significantly" in this context means that one skilled in the art would say that the properties of the variant may still be different but would not be unobvious over the ones   of the 10  original protein.<br>
The term "functionally equivalent derivatives" as used herein denotes a fragment or modified version of a parent polypeptide. The derivative may be modified by the addition<br>
15  of one or more naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acids or other molecules e.g. to facilitate coupling the polypeptide to another peptide or polypeptide, to a large carrier protein or to a solid support or its insertion into a membrane (e.g. the amino acids tyrosine, lysine, glutamic<br>
20  acid, aspartic acid, cysteine and derivatives thereof, NH2-acetyl groups or COOH-terminal amido groups, amongst others) and the basic properties of at least one of the parent polypeptides have not significantly been changed. "Significantly" in this context means that one skilled in the<br>
25  art would say  that the properties of the variant may still be different but would not be unobvious over the ones of the original protein.<br>
30  The terms "purified" or "substantially purified" as used herein denotes that the indicated nucleic acid or<br><br>
polypeptide is present in the substantial absence of other biological macromolecules, e.g., polynucleotides, proteins, and the like.  In one embodiment, the polynucleotide or polypeptide is purified such that it constitutes at least 5  95% by  weight, more preferably at least 99% by  weight, of the indicated biological macromolecules present (but water, buffers, and other small molecules, especially molecules having a molecular weight of less than 1000 daltons, can be present).<br>
10<br>
The term "isolated" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid or polypeptide separated from at  least  one  other component (e.g., nucleic acid or polypeptide) present with the nucleic acid or polypeptide in its natural source-  In one<br>
15  embodiment, the nucleic acid or polypeptide is found in the presence of (if anything) only a solvent, buffer, ion, or other component normally present in a solution of the same. The terms "isolated" and "purified" do not encompass nucleic acids or polypeptides present in their natural source.<br>
20<br>
The term "recombinant," when used herein to refer to a polypeptide or protein, means that a polypeptide or protein is derived from recombinant (e.g., microbial, insect, or mammalian) expression systems.  "Microbial" refers to<br>
25  recombinant polypeptides or proteins made in bacterial or fungal (e.g., yeast) expression systems.  As a product, "recombinant microbial" defines a polypeptide or protein essentially free of native endogenous substances and unaccompanied by associated native glycosylation.<br>
30  Polypeptides or proteins expressed in most bacterial<br>
cultures, e.g., E.   coli,   will be free of glycosylation<br><br>
modifications; polypeptides or proteins expressed in yeast will have a glycosylation pattern in general different from those expressed in mammalian cells.<br>
5  The term "expression vector" refers to a plasmid or phage or virus or vector, for expressing a polypeptide from a DNA (RNA) sequence.  An expression vehicle can comprise a transcriptional unit comprising an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene<br>
10  expression, for example, promoters and often enhancers, (2) a structural or coding sequence which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription and translation initiation and termination sequences.  Structural units intended for use in yeast or<br>
15  eukaryotic expression systems preferably include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell.  Alternatively, where recombinant protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it may include an amino terminal methionine residue.  This<br>
20  residue may or may not be subsequently cleaved from the expressed recombinant protein to provide a final product.<br>
The term "compartment" refers to a discrete 3D area that may or may not contain a solution and/or Solid matter.  In the 25  context of this invention a compartment may include the inside of a cell, the solution surrounding the cell, a contained space on one side of a membrane e.g. a well on a multiwelled plate.<br>
30  The term "membrane" denotes any thin, typically planar structure or material that separates two environments.<br><br>
Membranes of the invention include biological membranes (lipid bilayer membranes) such as cell membranes, membranes of cell organelles and artificial membranes capable of supporting an inserted protein e.g. polymeric membranes. 5<br>
The term "altering the composition" denotes altering the colour and or melanin composition of hair and.or skin by using inhibitors and activators of NCKX. The melanin composition of the hair and/or skin is determined by the 10  proportions of eumelanin and pheomelanin that is present in the tissue.<br>

siRNA duplexes and controls were tested). Western blot was also used  to evaluate  the expression and processing (maturation) of tyrosinase (tyr) in the same samples. SDS-PAGE (10% PA for NCKX5, 4-12% for tyr, 5μg protein/ lane).<br>

B) Western blot for tyr, via goat pAb (Santa Cruz). 1= No treatment, 2= scrambled siRNA control, 3-7= siRNA's 185, 260, 301, 492, 1110. Western blot A) shows 2 bands, of approx. 42 and 44 KDa (significantly<br>
20  smaller than the predicted m.w. for NCKX5) in control wells. These bands are absent in the samples where SLC24A5-specific duplexes were used (lanes 3-7). It is possible that the doublet represents the presence of alternate SLC24A5 splice variants. The expression and processing of tyrosinase after<br>
25  knockdown (B) suggests that NCKX5 does not grossly alter the expression and/or maturation of tyrosinase, the rate limiting enzyme for melanin biosynthesis.<br>

15  All 5 siRNA duplexes were shown to be capable of achieving SLC24A5 mRNA knockdown in mouse B16 melanocytes. 3 duplexes were shown to be capable of reducing mRNA levels by more than 80% under the test conditions.  Cells were transfected (Lipofectamine 2000) with 50nM siRNA duplex or control for 8<br>
20  hours. Cells were cultured for a further 24 hours, prior to harvesting and real-time PCR analyses.<br>
Figure 31 - SLC24A5 siRNA Duplexes and Viability Assessment in B16 Cells<br>
25  Cell viability and protein content determination post-treatment could help to identify the manner in which SLC24A5 modulates pigment production in B16 melanocytes.  Cell viability assessment at the end of each experiment suggested significant toxicity associated with the use of 2 duplexes<br>
30  (256 and 567). This conclusion is supported by data obtained for protein content. Duplex 762 appeared to reduce pigment<br><br>
production without affecting viability under the experimental conditions tested.<br>

Example 1 - Distribution of NCKX5 in individuals of 5.Asian ancestry<br>
Studies have shown that in a sample of individuals of UK 25  volunteers having S Asian ancestry there is a correlation<br>
between different allelic versions of NCKX5 and skin colour (described in a co-pending US application from the<br>
applicant).  NCKX5 has a single nucleotide polymorphism that<br>
encodes variation at amino acid position 111  and in dark 30  skins there is a predominance of the Alalll amino-acid<br>
residue, whilst in lighter skins there is a predominance of<br><br>
the Thrill amino-acid residue.  Figure 2 shows the distribution of these two alleles in darker and lighter skin types, from a total of 230 volunteers of South Asian descent.  Volunteers were selected by taking measurements of 5  non-sun exposed skin using a chromameter.  The L* reading of the chromameter gives a direct read out of the reflectance of skin, which in turn is directly related to the melanin content of the skin.  Volunteers who fell into the 20% 'extreme' tails of the skin colour distribution were<br>
10  genotyped. These volunteers therefore had either lighter or darker skin colour compared to the average.  The allele frequency difference for the non-synonymous polymorphism at aminoacid 111 of NCKX5 is 39% with an extremely low chance of false discovery (False Discovery Rate = 9.7 X 10"13) .<br>
15<br>
Example 2  - Activity of NCKX5<br>
The activity of NCKX5 and the effect of the two alleles (Alalll and Thrlll) on Sodium-Potassium/Calcium exchange was 20  investigated by mutating an NCKX exchanger (NCKX2) that is naturally found inserted in retinal rod photoreceptor cell membranes to more closely resemble NCKX5.<br>
The method of producing these constructs is as described in 25  Winkfein et al. (2003) Biochemistry vol 42 pg 543-552 and in investigating their effects as per Kang et al (2005) J Biiol chem.. vol 280 pg 6823-6833.<br>
The mutated NCKX2 was also modified to two forms by 30  including the NCKX5 SNP  (from position 111), at NCKX2<br>
residue 177 i.e. one NCKX2 form had an Alal77 and the other<br><br>
form a Thrl77.  (See figure 3 for the position of the variant in the three dimensional structure of the protein and a comparison of the sequence identity of the NCKX family) 5<br>
The modified NCKX2 was expressed and the calcium exchange function of the molecule was measured.  It was found that the Thrl77 version that is associated with light skin showed a significantly reduced calcium exchange in comparison to 10  the Alal77 version which is associated with dark skin. (See figure 4)<br>

Transcript Expression<br>
Method:<br>
mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR with Taqman 20  probes (purchased from Applied Biosystems) and normalised to<br>
housekeeper gene human transcription factor IID TATA box<br>
binding protein (huTBP).<br>
NCKX pre-designed and validated sybr primers from Qiagen :<br>
5196, 5197, 5198, 5199, 5200,5201,5202, 5203, 5204, 5205, 25  5206, 5207.  The primers/probes used were:<br>

- 4 FAM-linked<br>
huTBP ABI primer/probe set 4326322E, VIC-linked<br>
30  Materials:<br><br>
cDNA was derived from cultured melanocytes, fibroblasts and keratinocytes isolated from donors of Indian origin with various skin colours and also commercially sourced from Caucasian and Negroid donors<br>
5<br>
The cDNA derived from Indian volunteers was derived from skin biopsies.  Commercially sourced cDNA was derived from different human body tissues (brain, colon, kidney, lung, muscle, stomach and uterus).<br>
0<br>
Findings:<br>
NCKX5 mRNA transcript was detected in all the cultured melanocytes and skin biopsies tested.  The NCKX5 mRNA 5  expression levels in skin biopsies do not appear to<br>
correlate with colour differences, ethnic origin or SLC24A5 genotype in a small cohort tested (n=22)<br>
NCKX5 mRNA was not detectable by real-time PCR using Taqman 0  probes in the non-skin tissues (brain, colon, kidney, lung, muscle, stomach, and uterus).<br>
SLC24A5 mRNA was not detectable by real-time PCR using Taqman probes in cultured fibroblasts or keratinocytes (i.e<br>
5  skin cells other than melanocytes), however evidence, using Sybr green detection method (a realtime PCR method using qiagen quantitect kit using a Biorad icycler), that low levels of SLC24A5 mRNA may be present in cultures of dermal fibroblasts (at much lower levels than cultured melanocytes<br>
0  from the same donor.)<br><br>
In cultured melanocytes NCKX5 mRNA levels are higher than NCKX1 (SLC24A1) mRNA levels. NCKX4 (SLC24A4) and NCKX6 (SLC24A6) mRNA is detectable in cultured melanocytes, but at lower levels than NCKX5 or NCKX1 (SLC24A1), using the Sybr 5  green detection method.<br>
Protein Localisation<br>
Tools :<br>
10<br>
Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against 2 peptides fragments derived from NCKX5 (one in the predicted large hydrophilic loop and one in the carboxy-terminus of the protein).  Antibodies were affinity purified against the<br>
15  peptides.<br>
The antibodies were generated by Eurogenetec using the following protocol:<br>
20  Primary immunisation of 2 rabbits with both peptide<br>
fragments followed by 3 subsequent boosted immunisations 2, 4 and 8 weeks after primary immunisation.  Peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin and the final bleed was collected 12 weeks after the initial immunisation.  For<br>
25  affinity purification, each peptide was conjugated to<br>
spharose and 5 ml of final bleed sera was incubated with it in batch, packed into a column, washed in PBS and eluted into 100mM glycine-HCL pH2.5.  The elute was neutralised in 1M Tris at pH9 abd buffer exchanged into PBSA.<br><br>
Secondary detection was conducted using donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-fluor 488 (Invitrogen).<br>
Visualisation of the bound antibodies was conducted using by 5  confocal fluorescence microscopy.<br>
Material :<br>
Cultured primary human melanocytes from Caucasian or negroid 10  donors were grown on glass cover-slips and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with 0.5% Saponin.<br>
Findings :<br>
15  No evidence of plasma membrane staining indicating that NCKX5 was not localised in the plasma membrane.<br>
Punctate staining was found throughout cell.  indicating the presence of NCKX5 in the melanocyte. 20<br>
(See figure 5, for staining)<br>
Example 4 - Construction of NCKX5 Expression Vector<br>
25  All clones were inserted between the XhoI/NotI DNA-<br>
restriction sites in either vectors pEIA and pcDNA3.1   The pIEA vector is available from Cytostore as the TriplExpress vector (www.cytostore.com) and its structure and sequence is shown in Figure 6.  The PCDNA3.1 vector may be purchased<br>
30  from Invitrogen (www.invitrogen.com) and its structure is shown in Figure 7.<br><br>
DNA encoding the NCKX5 amino acid sequence (amino acids 63-64 EF; (GAGTTT)) was modified using standard recombinant methods to introduce an ECORl DNA restriction site (GAATTC).<br>
5  The insertion of the ECORl restriction site does  not   change the amino acid coding sequence but introduces a restriction site for a tag to be optionally inserted.  In some clones the nucleic acid molecule coding for the myc tag protein sequence (QKLISEEDL) was inserted immediately upstream of<br>
10  the newly inserted ECORl restriction site, i.e. in the region of the N terminus. The myc tag is recognised by a monoclonal  antibody,   which can be used in Western blot   to identify the newly synthesised proteins. The nucleic acid molecule encoding the 1D4 tag was added immediately before<br>
15  the stop codon at the end of the NCKX5 sequence i.e. at the C terminus.  The 1D4 tag is recognised by a monoclonal antibody, which can also be used in Western blot to identify the newly synthesised proteins.<br>
20  The N-terminal sequence of hsNCKX2 from position 1 (M) to 120 (Q), plus a myc tag at position 84 of the WT sequence, was ligated to a partial construct of hsNCKX5 at amino acid 63 taking advantage of the EcoRI restriction site.<br>
25  The sequences of the clones that were prepared as described above  are  given in 8 10 to 15.<br><br>

Methods<br>
5  Insect High Five ™ cells were transfected with the vectors of Example 1 e.g. coding for the full length human NCKX5 protein coupled to the leader sequence coding for the human NCKX2 signal peptide, using a suitable transfection method i.e. the use of the lepidopteron expression system method 10  described by Farrell et al.  (1998) Bio/Technology 60 pp656-663.<br>
High Five cells were collected and washed twice with 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 80 mM sucrose, and 200 mM EDTA.<br>
15  The final pellets were resuspended in 200 ml of ice-cold<br>
radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 140 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM EDTA, and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals catalogue number 1 836 170), and incubated on<br>
20  ice for 20 min. The samples were spun down in a<br>
microcentrifuge for 5 min at 20,000 3 g. Supernatants were removed and assayed for protein concentration using the Bradford dye-binding procedure (Bio-Rad). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard in all protein assays.<br>
25<br>
Protein samples were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and either stained with Gelcode Blue (Pierce) or transferred onto nitrocellulose  (Bio-Rad) in 25 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.3, containing 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol, and<br>
30  0.05% SDS. For Western blotting, the membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05%<br><br>
Tween 20) and 10% skim milk, briefly rinsed in TBST, and subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody {1:20 dilution of PMe-lB3 or 10 mg/ml of 6H2 antibody) in TBST with 1% skim milk added. After 5  washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with a 1:5000 dilution of sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBST plus 1% skim and then washed again. Immunodetection was carried out using LumiGlo chemiluminescent reagents (New 10  England Biolabs).<br>
HEK 293 cells were cultured in EMEM (Earle's minimum essential medium) at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Tl75cm2 cell culture flasks containing sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino 15  acids purchased from Biowhittaker and also containing 10% FC-S (foetal calf serum) and 2mM L-glutamine purchased from Sigma.<br>
HEK293 cells were transfected with a vector as made in 20  Example 2 e.g. coding for the truncated human NCKX5 protein coupled to the leader sequence coding for the human NCKX2 signal peptide, using the calcium phosphate precipitation transfection method described by Kang et al   (2005).<br>
25  Results of the expression tests are shown in the Western<br>
blots of figures 16 and 17.  These blots show that the test cells expressed both NCKX5 and the NCKX2/NCKX5 chimera in their various tagged forms.<br><br>

25  Transfection of HEK293 cells with NCKX2/NCKX5 chimera<br>
HEK293 cells were transfected with a chimera coding for the full length human NCKX5 protein coupled to the leader sequence coding for the human NCKX2 signal peptide, in order 30  to force protein expression at the plasma membrane, using a suitable transfection method, for example calcium phosphate<br><br>
precipitation as previously described (Rang et al   (2005) J Biol Chem 280(8): 6823-6833.<br>
Following transfection, HEK293 cells were plated into glass 5  bottomed 96 well plates at an appropriate cell density, for example 2 x 105 cells per well, and allowed to adhere overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2.<br>
Assay procedure<br>
10<br>
Adhered cells were washed with warmed PBS and incubated with up to 10μm of a calciam-sensitive dye ,Fluo4-AM dissolved in DMEM, for up to 1 h. Following dye loading, unhydrolysed dye was removed by washing cells twice with assay wash buffer as<br>
15  previously described {Kang et al  2005). Media was replaced with assay buffer depleted of Na+ to trigger reverse Ca2+/Na+ exchange (Kang et al  2005). Cells were then exposed to compounds from a compound library at various doses for various times at 37°C. Cells were transferred to a<br>
20  FLEXstation and treated with CaCl2 followed by KC1 to initiate potassium regulated Ca2+ / Na+ exchange. Intracellular fluorescence was measured in real-time. At reaction plateau, saponin was added to cells to determine maximum fluorescence as a dye-loading control. Additionally,<br>
25  this method can be used to assess calcium or potassium dependence by addition of varying calcium or potassium concentrations added to test cells.  This experiment may include a co-transfection with a fluorophor reporter plasmid to control for transfection efficiency.<br><br>
For data analysis, the fluorescence of untreated blank cells is subtracted from test cells. The amount of calcium flux measured in unknown samples is quantitated by comparison to a serially-diluted reference standard curve. The effect (s) 5  of test compounds on amount of calcium flux compared to untreated cells is determined and any increase or decrease in activity recorded. The assay can assess the effect of test compounds on maximal fluorescence, rate of fluorescence, Vmax, Km  or time to maximum fluorescence 10  compared to untreated cells. Test compounds determined to be exerting an effect can be re-tested over a broad concentration range to confirm efficacy.<br>
Automation of assay<br>
15<br>
The assay can be performed manually but can also be automated, for example using a Hamilton robotic system. Once transfection and plating are complete, the robot is able to perform all washing, dye loading, temperature-dependent 20  incubation of plates, compound additions and transfer of<br>
plates to FLEXstation. For higher throughput screening, the assay may be modified for use in 384 well or higher multi well plates.<br>

15  Analysis of intracellular NCKX activity in various cells in suspension<br>
An assay for intracellular Na-induced Ca2+ release was developed based on that previously described (Altimimi &amp;<br>
20  Schnetkamp 2007). B16 cells were trypsinised and centrifuged at 300g, 3 min. Cells were resuspended with 500ul basal DMEM and 12μM Fluo3-AM and incubated for 35 min at room temperature with rotation on an orbital rotary mixer. Cells were centrifuged 300g, 2 min and washed in 1.5ml Na+ loading<br>
25  media. Cells were resuspended in 275ul Na+-loading buffer<br>
(150mM NaCl, 20mM Hepes pH 7.4 with arginine, 3mM KC1, 1.5mM CaCl2, l0mM glucose, 250μM sulfinpyrazone). 50ul B16 cells were suspended in 2ml KCl media in a plastic, clear on all sides, cuvette. A magnetic flea was placed in the cuvette<br>
30  and the cuvette placed in a luminescence spectrometer with magnetic stirrer enabled and jacket heated to 25°C. The<br><br>
trace was started with readings every 1 second. At 10 seconds 2μM FCCP, luM gramicidin and luM thapsigargin was added. At 180 seconds, 75mM NaCl was added, at 200 seconds 350uM CaCl2 was added and once the trace had reached plateau, 5  0.01% saponin was added. The mean fluorescence counts of the 10 seconds immediately prior to sodium addition were used to subtract background signal from each of the data points of the sodium-induced calcium trace. The mean fluorescence counts for the final 10 seconds of the saponin-induced trace 10  were then used to normalise each data point of the sodium-induced calcium trace. Figure 18 shows the dose-dependent nature of Na+ dependent Ca2+ release in B16 cells when studied in cuvette suspension.<br>
15  Analysis of intracellular NCKX activity in various cells by HTS method<br>
The suspension assay previously described was modified for use in 96 well formats (Altimimi &amp; Schnetkamp 2007). Cells<br>
20  were plated into Greiner glass bottomed 96 well plates at 100,000 cells / well and adhered overnight. Media was removed and cells loaded with the Ca -sensitive dye Fluo4-AM in serum-free media at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were washed with sodium-loading buffer (150mM NaCl, 20mM Hepes pH 7.4<br>
25  with arginine, 3mM KC1, 1.5mM CaCl2, 10mM glucose, 250uM<br>
sulfinpyrazone) and following washing, 30ul sodium-loading buffer placed onto cells. 100μl of KCl assay buffer (150mM KC1, 20mM Hepes pH 7.4 with arginine, 100μM EDTA) containing 2uM FCCP, luM gramicidin and luM thapsigargin was placed<br>
30  onto cells and the plate inserted into a Molecular Devices FLEXStation. Fluorescence readings were taken every 3<br><br>
seconds for 300 seconds. 120mM NaCl was added at 120 seconds, 350μM CaCl2 was added at 200 seconds and 0.01% saponin added at 260 seconds. Following analysis, data was transferred to Excel. Background fluorescence was subtracted 5  from each Na+ and saponin-induced fluorescence components.<br>
Background subtracted Na+ fluorescence was then normalised to background subtracted saponin fluorescence by multiplication of Na+ data by the reciprocal of saponin data.<br>
The suitability of this assay for HTS was assessed by analysis of the Z' factor, signal to noise ratio and signal to background ratio. One plate of B16 cells was analysed on each of three separate days as described above. The Z' factor was calculated as:<br>
15<br>
{1-[(3*agonist SD)+(3*NSB SD)]}/(agonist mean - NSB mean) as previously described {Chen 2006, Zhang 1999) where NSB is non-specific background. The Z' factor for this assay was 0.4, S:N 22.5, S:B 2.8, suggesting that the assay was suitable for HTS. This assay format was automated for use on a Hamilton robotic platform for HTS.<br>
Figures 19 and 20 show the does dependent nature of Na+ dependent Ca2+ release in B16 cells when studied in 96 well assays that simulate high throughput assays.<br>

overnight. Media was removed and cells loaded with Fluo4-AM in serum-free DMEM at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were washed with sodium-loading buffer (150mM NaCl, 20mM Hepes pH 7.4 with arginine, 3mM KC1, 1.5mM CaCl2, l0mM glucose, 250uM 5  sulfinpyrazone) and following washing the slide was placed on the stage of the Leica TCS SPl Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).  The scanning head was fitted to an inverted Leica DM IRBE microscope.  A 40X plan apo 1.25 n.a. oil immersion phase<br>
10  contrast objective was used for collecting the images<br>
simultaneously in fluorescence and phase contrast. For image acquisition a frame size of 512 x 512 pixels was chosen and the sample scan rate was set to either maximum (1 frame every 0.87 seconds) or more typically one frame every 2<br>
15  seconds. An argon ion laser with an excitation wavelength of 488nm was used to excite the Fluo-4-loaded cells. Fluorescence emission was captured from 500 - 585nm. The field of view in all images was 250 x 250 urn.  Typical datasets were collected over 5 minutes. At time zero the<br>
20  cells were switched to KC1 assay buffer (150mM KC1, 20mM<br>
Hepes pH 7.4 with arginine, 100μM EDTA containing 2uM FCCP, luM gramicidin and 1μM thapsigargin). At 180 seconds, cells were switched to 75mM NaCl and at 250 seconds cells were switched to 350uM CaCl2 buffer. Analysis of the images and<br>
25  the export of .avi movie files were performed via Leica LCS operating software and the results exported as .xml files. Pixel intensity values over time were assessed by highlighting cells within the image and plotting these as a function of time.<br><br>

Analysis of heterologous NCKX2 activity in HEK 293 cells<br>
5<br>
Cultured HEK 293 cells were plated at 10,000 cells per well in glass bottomed 96 well plates and adhered overnight. Following adherence, cells were transfected with the short splice variant of the hNCKX2 gene cloned into pcDNA3.1<br>
10  expression vector. The short splice variant lacks a stretch of 17 amino acids within the cytoplasmic loop of the protein. A c-Myc tag was also inserted at the BstE II site between bases 241- 242, corresponding to amino acid residue 81 (Prinsen et  al  2000, Winkfein et al  2003) . Transfections<br>
15  were performed with Mirus 293 reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions for 48 h. Following transfection, media was removed and cells loaded with Fluo4-AM in serum-free DMEM at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were washed with sodium-loading buffer (150mM NaCl, 20mM Hepes pH 7.4<br>
20  with arginine, 3mM KCl, 1. 5mM CaCl2, l0mM glucose, 250μM<br>
sulfinpyrazone) and following washing, 30pl sodium-loading buffer placed onto cells. l00μl of KCl assay buffer (150mM KCl, 20mM Hepes pH 7.4 with arginine, 100μM EDTA) containing 2uM FCCP, luM gramicidin and luM thapsigargin was placed<br>
25  onto cells and the plate inserted into a Molecular Devices FLEXStation. Fluorescence readings were taken every 3 seconds for 500 seconds. 350μM CaCl2 was added at 150 seconds, 75mM NaCl was added at 180 seconds and 0.01% saponin added at 350 seconds. Alternatively, HEK 293 cells<br>
30  heterologously expressing hNHCX2 were loaded with Fluo4-AM for 30 min at 37 °C in a physiological salt solution (150mM<br><br>
NaCl, 20mM HEPES pH 7.4 with arginine, 6mM glucose, 0.25mM sulfinpyrazone, 0.lμM ouabain ± 1.5mM CaCl2) . Following removal of extracellular dye, cells were switched to LiCl2 assay buffer (150mM LiCl2, 20mM HEPES pH 7.4 with arginine, 5  6mM glucose, 0.1mM EDTA). At 120 seconds, 350uM CaCl2 was added followed by 50mM KC1 to initiate maximal rate of reverse calcium exchange. At maximal fluorescence 0.01% saponin was added. Following analysis, data was transferred to Excel. Background fluorescence was subtracted from each 10  Na+ and saponin-induced fluorescence components. Background<br>
subtracted Na+ fluorescence was then normalised to background subtracted saponin fluorescence by multiplication of Na+ data by the reciprocal of saponin data. See Figure 23.<br>

Example 8 - Methods for the Assessment of NCKX5 Activity in Relation to Melanogenesis in B16 cells<br>
10  A) Quantification of melanin production, protein content and cell viability of cultured B16 mouse melanocytes.<br>
1) Cell treatments 72 hours post-knockdown:<br>
The phenol free DMEM culture media was removed from each<br>
15    well for quantification of secreted melanin. Each well of the culture plate was then rinsed once with Dulbeccos phosphate buffered saline (dPBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) and replaced with 0.5ml Wstl reagent (diluted 1/10 in media) (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, West Sussex, UK). The<br>
20    culture plate was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. The Wstl reagent was removed from each well for determination of cell viability and each well was again rinsed with dPBS. 200ul of 1% w/v Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) in dPBS was added to each well of the<br>
25    culture plate. The plate was incubated for 20 minutes at 4 °C on an orbital shaker. Supernatant from each well was removed and centrifuged at 13000g for 5 minutes to remove cell debris. Soluble fractions were kept for protein quantification.<br>
30<br>
2) Melanin assay:<br><br>
lmg synthetic melanin (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) was dissolved in 50ul of 100%DMSO. 950ul phenol free DMEM + 10% FCS was added drop-wise to create a lmg/ml top standard. This standard was serially diluted (5-fold) in 5    media + FCS to give a standard curve for quantification o melanin in sample preparations (range from 1000 to 8 μg/ml). lOOul each standard and sample was placed in a 96 well microtitre plate in duplicate (Greiner Bio-One Ltd, Gloucestershire, UK) and the optical density (OD) of each 10    sample replicate was measured at 450nm using a Dynex MRX plate reader (Dynex Technologies Ltd, West Sussex, UK). The melanin content of each culture fraction was calculated from the synthetic melanin standard curve.<br>
15  3) Wstl assay:<br>
The OD450 of lOOul fractions (measured in duplicate) of post-incubation Wstl reagent was measured. The OD450 of each treatment was compared to evaluate relative viability.<br>
20<br>
4) Protein content determination:<br>
The protein content of each triton X-100 cell culture fraction was measured using a BCA assay kit (Perbio Science UK Ltd, Northumberland, UK) as per the<br>
25    manufacturers' instructions with the following<br>
modification: - l0μl of each solubilised protein fraction was placed in a 96-well microtitre plate in duplicate. 15ul dH20 was added to each sample prior to the addition of the BCA colour reagent. A standard curve was prepared<br>
30    by 2-fold serial dilution (using 1% triton X-100 in dPBS) of BSA (range = 2000 to 15.6ug/ml). The plate containing<br><br>
all samples and standard solutions was incubated for 15 minutes and the OD595 was measured. Protein content of each sample was calculated from the BSA standard curve.<br>
5  5) Calculation of ug melanin per ug protein:<br>
The ug/ml rnelanin content for each sample was divided by 2 to give the total melanin per sample. The ug/ml protein content derived from the BCA assay was multiplied by 2.5 (to account  for the assay  dilution step, then divided by 5 10    (accounting for the volume of triton used to lyse the<br>
cells and release protein. Finally, for each treatment, the total melanin (ug) value was divided by the total protein (μg) value to give ug melanin per ug protein.<br>
15    See Figure 29 for results showing that NCKX5 protein does modulate pigment production.<br>
B) Quantification of melanin production, NCKX5 protein expression and cell viability of cultured human 20    melanocytes,<br>
After siRNA-m.ediated knockdown of SLC24A5, the following assays were conducted: 1) Cell viability assessment: 25    Melanocyte viability 5 days after siRNA treatment was assessed by wstl assay as described in A) but with the following modifications: 1ml of 1/10 diluted (in culture media) Wstl reagent was added to each well of 6-well culture plates containing human melanocytes. The plates 30    were incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2 prior to the removal and OD450 assessment of the reagent.<br><br>
2)	Protein and melanin fractionation:<br>
Cultured Cells (trypsinised off of 6-well culture plates) were lysed on ice for 20 minutes in 1.5ml eppendorfs using 5    l00μl per sample of 1% triton X-100 in dPBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). Cell extracts were centrifuged (10 minutes at 13000g) to separate melanin and cell debris from the solubilised protein. The protein concentration of each supernatant 10    fraction was determined by BCA assay as described in A).<br>
3)	SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membranes:<br>
20ug protein (as determined by BCA assay) was<br>
reconstituted into 20ul of 1 x LDS loading buffer<br>
15    (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) containing lx reducing agent (invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK), heated to 40°C for 30 minutes and loaded onto 10% Novex bis-tris acrylamide gels with 1 x MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK). Kaleidoscope molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad<br>
20    Laboratories Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK) were run alongside samples for size determinations. Protein was transferred onto PVDF membrane by electrophoresis transfer, using a Bio-Rad mini-cell II trans-blotter and 1 x Tris-Glycine transfer buffer (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) + 15% v/v<br>
25    methanol (100V for 1 hour).<br>
4)	Western blotting to detect NCKX5:<br>
Membranes containing transferred protein were "blocked" using 2% w/v skimmed milk protein (SMP) in PBS + 0.05% 30    tween20 (PBST) for 1 hour with gentle agitation. Peptide<br>
affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (raised using<br><br>
a peptide equivalent to the C-terminus of NCKX5 -GNNKIRGCGG) was diluted to 0.5ug/ml using 2% SMP in PBST. The diluted antibody was incubated vith the membrane for 2 hours at room temperature. The membrane was then rinsed 5    with PBST (4x5 minutes washes). Peroxidase conjugated<br>
anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. PA, USA) was diluted 1/4000 using 2% SMP in PBST and was incubated with the membranes for 1 hour. Finally, membranes were washed using 6x5 minute rinses with PBST. 10    SuperSignal Western pico (Perbio Science UK Ltd,<br>
Northumberland, UK) chemiluminescence detection reagents was used to probe the membranes for secondary antibody binding as per the manufacturers instructions. ■ Visualisation of results was via a chemidoc XRS imaging 15    system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK) .<br>
5) Measurement of melanin content:<br>
To each pellet of melanin + cell debris obtained in section 2), 0.5 ml of diethyl ether: ethanol (1:1 ratio)<br>
20    was added. Eppendorfs were vortexed vigorously for 30<br>
seconds and centrifuged at 13000g for 5 minutes. The ether layer was carefully removed to waste and a further 0.5ml was added. The tubes were agitated and centrifuged as before. The liquid phase was again removed and the melanin<br>
25    pellets were allowed to air dry at room temperature for 10 minutes. Melanin pellets were solubilised by the addition of 200ul of 1M NaOH +10% DMSO and incubation (with occasional agitation) at 50°C for 1 hour. 80ul aliquots of each sample were transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate<br>
30    in duplicate. OD450 of each sample Was determined and the melanin content of each fraction was calculated from a<br><br>
synthetic melanin standard curve, prepared as described above. In treatment comparisons, results were expressed as ug melanin per μg protein.<br>

Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) was diluted (1:50) in Opti-MEM® I Reduced Serum Medium (Gibco) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min.  siRNA duplexes were diluted in Opti-MEM® I and combined with 1 volume of diluted<br>
10  Lipofectamine™ 2000.  Following a 15 min incubation period at room temperature, 4 volumes of Opti-MEM® I was added, and the resultant mixture used to transfect the cells. Following a 6-8h incubation period at 37°C with 10% CO2, the cells were transferred to MGM.  Cells were transfected on<br>
15  day 0 and again on day 5 if required.<br><br>
Immunofluorescence<br>
Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with siRNA duplexes where indicated.  Following a 72h, 5day or 10 5  day incubation, cells on coverslips were washed twice with PBS then fixed with 2% PFA in PBS for 20 min, washed a further 3 times, and permeabilised with 0.5% saponin in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with 0.2% BSA/0.1% saponin/PBS for lh at room temperature, then incubated with primary<br>
10  antibodies in 0.2% BSA/0.1% saponin/PBS for 1.5h at room temperature.  Primary antibody dilutions used were anti-NCKX5(827), 1:500; anti-NCKX5(826), 1:25 and anti-TGN46 (AbD Serotec), 1:200.  Coverslips were washed twice with 0.1% saponin/PBS and twice with 0.2% BSA/0.1% saponin/PBS, then<br>
15  incubated with secondary antibodies in 0.2% BSA/0.1%<br>
saponin/PBS for 45 min at room temperature.  Secondary antibodies (Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit or Alexa 633-conjugated anti-sheep) were purchased from Invitrogen and used at a dilution of 1:500.  Coverslips were washed twice<br>
20  with 0.2% BSA/0.1% saponin/PBS and twice with 0.1%<br>

Example 10 - Demonstration of lack of native SLC24A5 (NCKX5) in HEK 293  cells<br>
Sodium-induced intracellular calcium release in various 5  cells<br>
We have demonstrated that SLC24A5 mRNA is undetectable in HEK 293 cells and human keratinocytes. Moreover, transcript expression is lower in MEWO cells than primary human<br>
10  melanocytes or B16 cells. Therefore we investigated the extent of Na+-induced intracellular Ca2+ release in these cells. 100,000 cells were plated in triplicate to a 96 well plate, adhered overnight and intracellular Ca2+  release investigated as described in-"Analysis of intracellular NCKX<br>
15  activity in various cells by HTS method". Whilst some<br>
activity was detected in HEK 293, MEWO and keratinocytes, the rank order of normalised activity is follows our prediction based  on transcript expression profiles (Figure 32) .<br>
20<br>
The early time-points from the trace on Figure 33 show a clear difference in rates of sodium-induced calcium release from an intra-cellular store between cells expressing high levels of SLC24A5 transcript (dark and light melanocytes,<br>
25  B16 melanocytes) and those with undetectable SLC24A5<br>
transcript (HEK-293 and ketratinocytes). The MeWo cells have intermediate levels of SLC24A5 transcript (and do not produce melanin under these conditions) which corresponds with an intermediate level of sodium-induced calcium<br>
30  release.<br><br>
SLC24 and SLC8 mRNA expression HEK 293 and human keratinocytes<br>
To assess if SLC24A5 and SLC8 family members are expressed 5  at the transcript level in HEK 293 cells, RNA was extracted from cultured HEK 2 93 cells and real-time PCR performed. SLC24A5 mRNA was undetected and SLC8 mRNA was detected at low levels. Previous studies have demonstrated that plasma membrane NCKX activity is undetected in untransfected HEK 10  293 cells suggesting that NCKX1 - NCKX4 proteins are not expressed at detectable levels (Kang et al  2005; Cooper et al   1999; Visser et al  2007).<br>

Example 11 - Pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound isolated in step (i) of 10  the method of the first aspect of the invention in admixture with a cosmetically, pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.<br>
Preferably, the formulation is a unit dosage containing a 15  daily dose or unit, daily sub-dose or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
The compounds of the invention will normally be administered orally or by any parenteral route, in the form of a<br>
20  pharmaceutical formulation comprising the active ingredient, optionally in the form of a non-toxic organic, or inorganic, acid, or base, addition salt, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form.  Depending upon the disorder and patient to be treated, as well as the route of<br>
25  administration, the compositions may be administered at varying doses.<br>
In human therapy, the compounds of the invention can be administered alone but will generally be administered in 30  admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient diluent<br><br>
or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
For example, the compounds of the invention can be 5  administered topically, orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed- or controlled-release applications.  The compounds of invention may also be 10  administered via  intracavernosal injection.<br>
Such tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as<br>
15  starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxy-propylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia.<br>
20  Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules.  Preferred excipients in this<br>
25  regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.  For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the compounds of the invention may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or<br>
30  suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered parenterally, for example, intravenously/ intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intrasternally, intracranially, intra-muscularly or<br>
5  subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion techniques.  They are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood.  The aqueous solutions should be<br>
10  suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary.  The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those. skilled in the art.<br>
15<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the<br>
20  intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.  The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried<br>
25  (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.  Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br><br>
For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the compounds of the invention will usually be from 1mg/kg to 30 mg/kg. Thus, for example, the tablets or capsules of the compound of the invention may 5  contain a dose of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate.  The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. 10  The above dosages are exemplary of the average case.  There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
15  The compounds of the invention can also be administered<br>
intranasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.<br>
20  dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorotetrafluoro-ethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A3  or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane {HFA 227EA3) , carbon dioxide or other suitable gas.  In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the<br>
25  dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to<br>
deliver a metered amount.  The pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g.   using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a<br>
30  lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate.  Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or<br><br>
insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
5  Aerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff" delivers an appropriate dose of a compound of the invention for delivery to the patient.  It will be appreciated that he overall daily dose with an aerosol will vary from patient to patient, and may 10  be administered in a single dose or, more usually, in divided doses throughout the day.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the invention can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or<br>
15  they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion,<br>
solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder.  The compounds of the invention may also be transdermally administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch.  They may also be administered by the ocular route, particularly for treating<br>
20  diseases of the eye.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the compounds of the invention can be formulated as micronised suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in 25  isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in<br>
combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride.  Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
30  For application topically to the skin, the compounds of the invention can be formulated as a suitable ointment<br><br>
containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, 5  emulsifying wax and water.

Product Preparation, Form, Use and Packaging<br>
To prepare the topical composition used in the method of the 30  present invention, the usual manner for preparing skin care products may be employed.  The active components are<br><br>
generally incorporated in a dermatologically/cosmetically acceptable carrier in conventional manner.  The active components can suitably first be dissolved or dispersed in a portion of the water or another solvent or liquid to be 5  incorporated in the composition.  The preferred compositions are oil-in-water or water-in-oil or water-in-oil-in-water emulsions.<br>
The composition may be in the form of conventional skin-care 10  products such as a cream, gel or lotion, capsules or the like.  The composition can also be in the form of a so-called "wash-off" product e.g. a bath or shower gel, possibly containing a delivery system for the actives to promote adherence to the-skin during rinsing.  Most 15  preferably the product is a "leave-on" product; a product to be applied to the skin without a deliberate rinsing step soon after its application to the skin.<br>
The composition may packaged in any suitable manner such as 20  in a jar, a bottle, tube, roll-ball, or the like, in the<br>
conventional manner. It is also envisaged that the inventive compositions could be packaged as a kit of two separate compositions one containing the petroselinic acid and the second containing the phenolic compound, to be applied to 25  the skin simultaneously or consecutively.<br>
The composition according to the invention may also be formulated into a form suitable for oral ingestion such as a capsule, tablet or similar.<br><br>
The method of the present invention may be carried out one or more times daily to the skin which requires treatment. The improvement in skin appearance will usually become visible after 3 to 6 months, depending on skin condition, 5  the concentration of the active components used in the inventive method, the amount of composition used and the frequency with which it is applied.  In general, a small quantity of the composition, for example from 0.1 to 5 ml is applied to the skin from a suitable container or applicator 10  and spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hands or fingers or a suitable device.  A rinsing step may optionally follow depending on whether the composition is formulated as a "leave-on" or a "rinse-off" product.<br>
