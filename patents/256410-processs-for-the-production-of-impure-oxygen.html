BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the annexed accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figures  1 to 4 are schematic illustrations of four embodiments of the apparatus for air distillation according to the invention. Description of Preferred embodiments<br>
The apparatus illustrated in Figure 1 is intended to produce oxygen at a purity of the order of 85% under a pressure of the order of 7.4 bars absolute. It essentially comprises a double column 1 for air distillation, consisting of a mean pressure column (or "column MP") 2 operating under 15.7 bars absolute and a low pressures column (or "column LP") 3 operating under 6.3 bars absolute, a main heat exchange line 4, a sub-cooler 5, an auxiliary vaporizer-condenser 6 and a turbine 7 for blowing air into the low pressure column. Column 3 is disposed over column 2 and contains, at the bottom, a vaporizer-condenser 8 and, above the latter, a second vaporizer-condenser 9.<br><br>
The air to be distilled arrives under the mean pressure via a duct 10 and is introduced into heat exchange line 4. The major portion of this air is cooled to the vicinity of its dew point and exits at the cold end of the exchange line, the remainder exiting from the exchange line at an intermediate temperature, being expanded at the low pressure in turbine 7 to ensure cold conditions in the apparatus, and is blown at an intermediate level into column LP 3.<br>
A portion of the entirely cooled air is introduced, via duct 11, at the base of column MP 2, and the remainder is condensed in vaporizer-condenser 6; a portion of the liquid obtained is introduced via duct 12 at an intermediate point of column 2, and the remainder, after sub-cooling at 5 and expansion in an expansion valve 13, is introduced at an intermediate point of column LP 3.<br>
The "rich liquid" (oxygen enriched air) collected at the bottom of column MP , after sub-cooling at 5 and expansion in an expansion valve 14, is introduced at an intermediate point of column LP. Similarly, "poor liquid" (impure nitrogen) withdrawn from an intermediate point of column MP, is introduced at the top of column LP after sub-cooling at 5 and expansion in an expansion valve 15.<br>
The substantially pure nitrogen which is introduced at the top of column MP is in part removed from the apparatus as a product, after heating in the exchange line, via duct 16, and, the remainder, is sent in gas form via duct 17, under the mean pressure, to the upper vaporizer-condenser 9. After condensation, this nitrogen is sent under reflux at the top of the column MP via duct 18.<br>
Moreover, impure gaseous nitrogen, withdrawn from an intermediate point of column 2 and, in this example, at the same level as the poor liquid,<br>
is sent via duct 19, under the mean pressure, to the lower vaporizer-condenser 8.  The liquid thus obtained is  sent  under  reflux  condition  into  column  MP, substantially at the same level, via duct 20.<br>
The flows of fluids which exit from the double column are:<br>
-at the top of column MP, mean pressure nitrogen, which has been mentioned above;<br>
-at the top of column LP, impure nitrogen, constituting the residual gas of the apparatus. This impure nitrogen, after warming up in the sub-cooler 5 and in exchange line 4, is evacuated via duct 21; and<br>
-at the bottom of column LP, impure liquid oxygen. This liquid is withdrawn via duct 22, is compressed by means of pump 23 at the production pressure (7.4 bars absolute in this example), is thereafter vaporized in vaporizer-condenser 6 by condensing the portion of mean pressure air which passes through the latter, then is warmed up in gaseous form in the exchange line and is evacuated from the apparatus via production duct 24.<br>
As a variant, pump 23 could be removed, the impure oxygen then being vaporized at 6 under low pressure.<br>
The above description shows that, for a given temperature gap in the vaporizer-condenser 8, the temperature of the liquid at the bottom of column LP is determined by that of the gas which is condensed in this vaporizer-condenser. Since this is an intermediate gas from column MP, which is warmer than nitrogen from the top of this column, the temperature of the bottom liquid, which consists of impure oxygen, is relatively elevated. Consequently, for a desired purity of this impure oxygen, the pressure of column LP, i.e. the low pressure, may be increased.  Finally,<br>
there is obtained impure oxygen and impure nitrogen under an increased pressure, which enables to save costs in their production, for example with respect to the energy required to compress impure nitrogen at the desired pressure in a gas turbine (not illustrated) coupled to the apparatus, for example in the manner described in US 4,224,045 mentioned above.<br>
In this context, the upper vaporizer-condenser 9 serves to provide the required reflux at the top of column MP.<br>
If the temperatures of the two gases which are fed to the two vaporizers-condensers are clearly different from one another, it is necessary to provide a certain number of distillation plates 25 between the vaporizers-condensers. In the opposite case, these plates may be removed, which simplifies the construction of column LP, and the two vaporizers-condensers may even be integrated into a single heat exchanger. This is why plates 25 have been illustrated in broken line.<br>
The apparatus illustrated in Figure 2 differs from Figure 1 only on the following points.<br>
Impure oxygen is withdrawn as a gas from column LP 3, and is simply warmed up in exchange line 4 before being evacuated via duct 24. This is particularly interesting when impure oxygen is intended to be produced under low pressure. Consequently, the vaporizer-condenser 6 is removed.<br>
Moreover, a fraction of the mean pressure air which is cooled to the vicinity of its dew point is sent, via duct 26, to lower vaporizer-condenser 8 at the place of the intermediate gas of Figure 1. With respect to this intermediate gas, it feeds an intermediate vaporizer-condenser 27 located between lower and upper vaporizers-condensers 8 and 9. As previously,  plates may or may not be provided<br>
between the pairs of vaporizers-condensers. Liquefied air which is produced by the vaporizer-condenser 8 is sent in part, via duct 28, into column MP and in part, after sub-cooling at 5 and expansion in expansion valve 13, into column LP.<br>
As compared to the solution of Figure 1, there is obtained a higher temperature at the bottom of column LP, which is favorable to an increase of the low pressure. On the contrary, a liquid which contains more oxygen than the impure oxygen to be produced must be vaporized, which tends to reduce the low pressure.<br>
The latter disadvantage is overcome in the apparatus of Figure 3, which enables to produce impure oxygen under an elevated pressure, and which differs from the previous one on the following points.<br>
On the one hand, impure oxygen is withdrawn in liquid form from the vat of column LP, then is brought to pump 23 at the desired production pressure, is thereafter vaporized and warmed up under this pressure in exchange line 4 before being removed from the apparatus via duct 24.<br>
On the other hand, to compensate for the loss of reflux in column MP resulting from the removal of liquid oxygen at the bottom of column LP, there is provided a nitrogen cycle, so called rectification support cycle, which is used simultaneously to ensure the vaporization of impure oxygen: part of the nitrogen produced at the top of column 3 (which, in this case, has a top "minaret" 30 which is supplied at its top portion by means of pure liquid nitrogen originating from the upper vaporizer-condenser 9 and which, then, produces pure nitrogen under low pressure) is, after warming up in the exchange line, compressed by means of a compressor 31, at mean pressure. This mean pressure nitrogen, combined  with  a  flow  of  mean  pressure  nitrogen<br>
withdrawn from duct 16, is again compressed by means of compressor 33 at a vaporization pressure of impure oxygen compressed by means of pump 23, liquefied in the exchange line, and, after expansion in an expansion valve 34, is introduced under reflux condition at the top of column MP.<br>
The apparatus of Figure 4 also includes a column LP 3 with minaret 30. However, contrary to the preceding case, it is high pressure air, boosted at a vaporization pressure of impure oxygen by means of a booster 35, which ensures the vaporization of impure oxygen in the exchange line 4. In this example, after liquefying and expansion in an expansion valve 3 6 and in an expansion valve 13, this air is distributed between the two columns 2 and 3. Consequently, the compressor 33 and the expansion valve 34 of Figure 3 are removed.<br>
Moreover, the nitrogen from compressor 31, which is compressed at a higher pressure than mean pressure, feeds in gas form, after cooling in the exchange line, the lower vaporizer-condenser 8, and the resulting liquid nitrogen, after expansion in an expansion valve 37, is combined with mean pressure liquid nitrogen which is produced by the upper vaporizer-condenser 9. This has the advantage of permitting a control of the vat temperature of the LP column and therefore the pressure of this column by control of the pressure of nitrogen which feeds the vaporizer-condenser 8. This pressure of nitrogen may be chosen between the mean pressure and the pressure at which nitrogen is condensed at the cold end of the exchange line.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
