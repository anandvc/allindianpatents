RGBW Color Liquid Crystal Displays and Natural Images<br>
[025] The "real world" is a subtractive color system. Save for relatively rare emissive<br>
light sources such as LEDs and lasers, high brightness saturated colors are not found in real world<br>
scenes that arc viewed by the human vision system in the course of an individual going about his or<br>
her daily life. In daily experience, colors are formed by relatively bright white light falling onto<br>
pigmented objects that absorb some portion of the light and reflecting the rest. Colors are formed<br>
by selectively absorbing part of the spectrum and reflecting another part of the spectrum. Noncolor-<br>
saturatcd objects such as white or pastel colored objects may substantially reflect most of the<br>
light, thus being radiomelrically and visually brighter than saturated color objects. Conversely,<br>
objects that form saturated colors absorb most of the light and reflect only a narrow band (or bands<br>
in the case of purple or magenta) of the full spectrum of light falling on it. This reduces the<br>
brightness of saturated colored objects compared to non-saturated color objects. This is especially<br>
true for saturated colors that are near the corners of the color triangle of red, green, and blue, as to<br>
achieve these colors, the light must be in very narrow wavelength bands. Further, specular<br>
reflections occur at the surfaces of objects which do not substantially alter the spectrum of light<br>
falling on them, giving reflection highlights that are non-color-saturated, even on objects that aTe<br>
observed to be highly color-saturated in lambertian reflection. These highlights are the brightest<br>
portions of many natural scenes (e.g. the mirror like reflection of an overhead light on a brightly<br>
colored billiard ball is white, not colored). Thus, by their very nature, real world scenes may have<br>
bright non-color-saturated objects and darker color-saturated objects.<br>
[026] Some natural images have highly saturated colors. In these images, the brightest<br>
red, green, and blue colors are far darker than the white found in natural images. Even yellow,<br>
which may be formed from a mixture of red and green - may not be as bright as white. Other<br>
images - typically photographs of indoor objects (e.g. faces) ~ might not have such brightly colored<br>
objects. When examining the statistical occurrence of highly saturated colors vs. non-saturated<br>
colon, one finds that saturated colors are relatively rare in natural images. When saturated colors<br>
do occur, they are quite dark. Further, given the subtractive nature of color formation in natural<br>
scenes, bright saturated colors are almost non-existent<br>
[027J For electronic displays to render natural scenes, it might be best for it to be able to<br>
create very bright non-color-saturated colors and darker highly saturated colors. Upon inspection of<br>
the capabilities of the conventional three primary, RGB, system, one notes that it is a color additive<br>
system whose non-saturated color brightness is limited to the addition of partially-saturated colors.<br>
The brightness/saturation color gamut of the RGB system generally has brighter non-saturated<br>
colors, but fails to reproduce the very bright non-saturated colors.<br>
[028] There is a trade-off between the brightness of the non-saturated colors and the color<br>
saturation gamut of the filtered backlight display. The more saturated the color filters, the less<br>
these filtered colors may add to the non-saturated brightness. This creates a luminance/saturation<br>
compression in which the non-saturated colors are reduced in brightness and saturated colors are<br>
compressed, dcsaturated, to fit within the limitations of the compromise system. Another color<br>
formation system is required to better display natural images.<br>
[029] RCiBW liquid crystal displays provide an additional primary: White. These White<br>
subpixels are substantially brighter than the Red, Green, and Blue subpixels since the White is<br>
formed by using a transparent filter that allows substantially all of the light through, while the other<br>
three colors are formed by filtering out all but a narrow band of the spectrum. Since such filters are<br>
not ideal bandpass filters, the transmissivity is less than 100% even in the desired bandpass<br>
wavelengths, which further darkens the subpixcl. The White subpixel may have up to four or more<br>
times the brightness of the colored subpixels. Thus, the use of a white subpixel significantly<br>
increases the brightness of the panel when displaying non-saturated colors.<br>
[030] If one fourth of the area of the panel is used for the White subpixel, the brightnesses<br>
of the remaining RGB subpixels are reduced by one fourth. However, non-saturated colors may be<br>
formed with a contribution from the bright White subpixel, giving significantly higher brightness.<br>
The resulting panel has a brightness/color gamut envelope shape that is closer to that of the 'real<br>
world'. The loss of brightness of the saturated colors is an acceptable trade-off when considering<br>
the statistics of natural images. However, as the choice of conventional RGB primaries was a<br>
compromise between the desired saturation of the primaries and the brightness of non-saturated<br>
colors, the introduction of the White subpixel offers a new optimization point.<br>
[031] Since the White subpixel provides the majority of the brightness of non-saturated<br>
colors, the saturation of the RGB primaries may be increased with only minor decrease of<br>
brightness of the non-saturated colors. This decrease may be partially offset by increase in the<br>
aperture ratio of the 1:2 aspect ratio subpixel for some (e.g. small) panels, with its reduced<br>
horiamtal subpixel density, compared to the 1:3 aspect ratio subpixel found in conventional RGB<br>
stripe displays. This may result in an RGBW display that has both increased brightness and<br>
saturation envelope at every point compared to the conventional RGB display. Fully saturated<br>
colors may be darker on the optimized RGBW system compared to the RGB system, but at the<br>
saturation maximum color points of the RGB system, the RGBW brightness may be the same or<br>
higher. Thus, no real loss of color brightness occurs.<br>
[032] Such a RGBW system more closely approaches the 'real world' natural image<br>
envelop and statistics, providing higher brightness and deeper saturation. The present invention<br>
discloses a plurality of high brightness layouts for displays. These layouts, in turn, may be driven<br>
by various Gamut Mapping Algorithms (GMA) - either in the prior art or as disclosed in many<br>
applications incorporated herein. Further, with the use of SubPixel Rendering (SPR) algorithms as<br>
disclosed in applications incorporated herein, such panels may maintain color accuracy while<br>
lowering cost and increasing contrast.<br>
[033] As disclosed on other applications incorporated by reference, one embodiment of a<br>
SPR algorithm treats the White subpixel as another color primary. Starting from color theory<br>
basics, this embodiment transforms the values of the input RGB using linear matrix multiplication.<br>
This results in a transform that maintains the hue and saturation of all colors.<br>
[034] The brightness increase from RGB to RGBW may be linear and a constant<br>
multiplier for all colors inside of the RGBW brightness/saturation gamut envelope. In the unlikely<br>
event a bright, saturated color in the image exceeds the RGBW brightness/saturation gamut<br>
envelope, one embodiment maps the color to the brightest color at that same hue and saturation that<br>
the display may render. This may be a reasonable trade-off, as the human vision system does not<br>
measure absolute brightness, only relative brightness. Further, very bright, highly saturated colors<br>
are an infrequent occurrence in natural images. Thus lowering the peak brightness of a highly<br>
saturated color slightly does not severely distort an image; while color saturation and hue are<br>
generally recognized and noticeable when they are distorted.<br>
High Brightness Layouts For Displays<br>
[03 5] Having discussed some of the advantages and trade-offs of high brightness (e.g.<br>
RGBW) layouts, several embodiments of such layouts will now be disclosed. Figure 1 depicts one<br>
embodiment of layout 100. Layout 100 substantially comprises a plurality of repeating subpixel<br>
group 102 further comprising white (e.g. no color filter) 104, green 106, red 108 and blue 110<br>
subpixels. As may be seen, the white subpixels are the majority number of all the subpixels and<br>
may optionally comprise a smaller dimension and/or area than the other colored subpixels. The<br>
value of placing the white on the majority, thinner, subpixels is that they provide high Modulation<br>
Transfer Function (MTF) depth. The same effect is given to the higher occurrence of green<br>
subpixels as compared to red and blue subpixels,<br>
[036] For subpixel rendering this display, the white subpixels may be mapped one to one<br>
with an incoming conventional data set (e.g. RGB or any other suitable data format). The colors<br>
may then be subpixel rendered, filtered to remove chromatic aliasing to maintain proper color, in<br>
the manners described in several applications incorporated by reference. Also, the phase of the<br>
planes may be adjusted to be either coincident with the incoming data set or 180° out of phase with<br>
the white subpixel alignment as desired. The first may be suitable for text and other non bandlimited<br>
images, the second may be suitable for pictures or supersampling subpixel rendering of text,<br>
glyphs, etc. The color subpixel locations may also benefit from interpolation/subpixel rendering for<br>
proper digital image reconstruction of bandlimited images.<br>
[037] It should be noted that the backlight color temperature may be adjusted to have more<br>
magenta, red and blue, energy than that for the typical RGB LCD to give a balanced white.<br>
Alternatively, the green subpixels may be adjusted towards the upper green point on the CIH 1931<br>
chart, decreasing its brightness but increasing its color saturation, to give better color gamut and<br>
proper white balance. Another alternative might be to combine the effects of the above two<br>
embodiments. It should also be noted that this layout has an MTF Limit (MTFL) at the Nyquist<br>
limit of the white subpixels in all directions. MTFL may be thought of as the highest number of<br>
black &amp; white lines that may be simultaneously rendered without chromatic aliasing.<br>
[03 8] It will be appreciated that the present invention encompasses all mirror images of the<br>
repeating subpixel groups and other symmetries possible for Figure 1 and for all Figures disclosed<br>
herein. Additionally, the position assignments of the colored subpixel are also subject to change<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the positions of red and<br>
blue subpixels in Figure 1 may be changed or transposed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Also, the positions of the green subpixels may be changed with the red and the blue subpixels<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[039] Another set of embodiments for the present invention included: for every subpixel<br>
layout shown herein having a "white" subpixel, an additional embodiment would replace some or<br>
all of the "white" subpixels with the colors "yellow", "grey", or "blue-grey" (e.g. not colored but<br>
fully transmissive). Yellow, grey, or blue-grey do not have the same transmissivity as white does;<br>
however, yellow, grey or blue-grey do present high transmissivity and would also provide a "high"<br>
brightness performance. For subpixels layouts employing red, green, blue, white, and cyan, it<br>
might be desirable to replace some or all of the white with the color "pink".<br>
[040] Two other embodiments of high brightness layouts are shown in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
As with Figure 1, the white subpixels are the majority subpixels and may optionally be of decreased<br>
size or dimension. This gives high MTF Limit performance. The repeating pattern 202 in Figure 2<br>
comprises red, green, and blue subpixels - as well as a cyan subpixel 204 (shown in finer<br>
horizontal hatching lines than the blue subpixels in these Figures). This may perhaps have more<br>
blue resolution than may be required, but the arrangement should be straight-forward to<br>
manufacture and subpixel render. For white color balance, the backlight may be more red energy,<br>
to counter the increased transmission of cyan, than the typical backlight for an RGB LCD display.<br>
Alternatively, the green and cyan may be darker, purer colors, towards the green peak of the CIE<br>
1931 chart, resulting in a high color temperature display. This arrangement may allow for a bright,<br>
high MTF Limit, high SPR Moir6 Limit, high color gamut display. Given that the white subpixel<br>
adds brightness to the system and that the use of the cyan color tends to give a wider color gamut, it<br>
may be advantageous to set the color points of the minority subpixels to be deeply saturated to<br>
result in a wide color gamut.<br>
[041] Figure 3 depicts an alternative for a five color system, RGMCW system, allowing<br>
even higher MTF Limit performance at the expense of deep blue performance. The repeating<br>
subpixel group 302 comprises red, green, cyan (204) and magenta (304) subpixels. In another<br>
embodiment, it may be possible to vertically displace the white majority subpixels from the<br>
minority subpixel grid ISO0 to expand the SPR Moire Limit to a full circle. As these layouts have a<br>
square grid of white subpixels, the monochromatic MTF Limit displayed is a square MTF Limit<br>
boundary, matching that of the conventional RGB Stripe system.<br>
 [042] Figure 4 is yet another embodiment of a high brightness layout 400. Its repeating<br>
subpixel group is a 3 x 6 subpixel group 402 where the colored subpixels comprise red, green and<br>
blue subpixels in a mosaic pattern. Here the white subpixels are again the majority subpixels and<br>
are optionally more narrow that the other colored subpixels. The RGB colored subpixels are equal<br>
in number and size. This display may have the virtue of using a conventional backlight color and<br>
having pure white at maximum brightness when all of the subpixel values are full "on". This panel<br>
may also be immune to color shifts when mask shifts occur during manufacturing.<br>
[043] This panel tends to have high Luminance MTF Limit out into the corners as well as<br>
an extended Moire Limit. However, it may have a highly asymmetrical chrominance MTF Limit,<br>
as with the classic Mosaic pattern. As one third of the panel area is high brightness white, the<br>
brightness is expected to be significantly higher than a traditional RGB panel using the same color<br>
filter points. This added brightness of the white may be used to trade-off some of the brightness<br>
gain for color gamut increase for a TV or HDTV product, by using higher saturation, but lower<br>
transmission color filters, as previously described.<br>
[044] As an alternative, the subpixel width ratio could be altered as desired for white/color<br>
brightness trade-off. For example, one could set the two sizes identically, giving a brighter white<br>
value, but lower saturated color brightness. This example has the added benefit of using the same<br>
size subpixels, with an aspect ratio of one-to-two (1:2) — or, alternatively, one-to-three (1:3) -<br>
being very easy to design and manufacture with present design rules. Yet another alternative might<br>
be to place the red, green and blue subpixels in vertical or horizontal stripes.<br>
[045] In the co-pending '094 application, the layout of Figure 5B has been proposed where<br>
the pixel size has an aspect ratio of 2:3 (width:height). This may result in increased pixel visibility<br>
when compared to RGB stripe at same resolution. Thus, Figure 5B shows a similar layout<br>
repeating group 502 with red, green, blue and white subpixels; but with a one-to-three (1:3) aspect<br>
ratio of conventional RGB stripe, shown for comparison in Figure 5A. One advantage is that the<br>
layout may utilize the existing RGB-stripe TFT array.<br>
[046] It should be noted that the pixel sizes are identical but the color order is changed.<br>
The repeat cycle is 2x3 pixels. The white pixels are shown in line within a row, but they can also<br>
be made to alternate for another embodiment. Resolution for this design should be 2x in horizontal<br>
axis compared to RGB stripe and Ix in vertical. Subpixel rendering can be adjusted to perform<br>
scaling in horizontal, or a video chip can be used to sample the data at 2x rate in horizontal axis. Li<br>
either case, the performance of the LCD should be improved with less Moire noise and higher<br>
MTF. Brightness gain for 25% color filter transmission should be<br>
((5/6)*25-Kl/6)*100)/25=37.5/25=1.5.<br>
[047] Figure 6B is yet another embodiment (shown next to RGB striped panel Figure 6A)<br>
that has a repeating group 602. In this embodiment, the subpixels are of substantially equal size to<br>
maintain white balance. The repeat group 602 is 2x4 subpixels. It should be noted that the number<br>
of colors is the same within a repeat group (R,G,B,W). This should result in balanced white with<br>
existing backlights. In this case the horizontal and vertical resolution should be the same as RGB<br>
stripe, but the number of column drivers and TFTs is reduced by 1/3. Brightness gain depends on<br>
color filter transmission; assuming 25% transmission (typical) for colored filters and 100% for<br>
white, then transmission for white screen is (3/4) 25+(l/4) 100= 175/4 = 43.75% which is roughly<br>
a pin of 43.75/25-1.75.<br>
[048] Figure 7B (shown next to RGB stripe layout Figure 7A for comparison) is a<br>
variation of Figure 6B. In this case, the subpixel repeating group 702 is the same as group 602 but<br>
in the 1:3 aspect ratio, hi this case, the resolution in the horizontal tends to be increased by 1.5x.<br>
This design uses existing TFT array and drive electronics with no cost savings, but resolution and<br>
brightness tends to be increased. Brightness gain is similar as noted above<br>
[049] Now, brightness with the novel high brightness layouts disclosed herein may have<br>
an impact in the portable (e.g. cell phone) application and the TV market as a consequence. As<br>
with typical RGB-stripe LCDs utilize, the transmissivity of the LCD is typically 5-10%, depending<br>
on color filter and polarizer transmission, as well as "aperture ratio" of TFT array, Thus to achieve<br>
500 cd/m2 output, as much as 5000-10000 cd/m2 output from the backlight may be required. This<br>
can increase cost and increase heat of the TV system. In portable applications, it can reduce battery<br>
life.<br>
[050] With the novel high brightness layouts disclosed herein, the backlight brightness<br>
may be reduced by as much as one half as required by conventional RGB striped systems having<br>
substantially the same resolution. This decrease in backlight brightness is made possible by (a)<br>
increasing the aperture ratio by using these novel layouts, and (b) increasing transmission of the<br>
system by adding white subpixels. In these embodiments, the brightness of the system may<br>
improve by up to 1.75x or, alternatively, the power can be reduced by more than 40%. In the case<br>
of LCD TV for home use, this can mean a reduction in the number of lamps from 16 to 10, for<br>
significant power, cost, and heat savings, while maintaining average brightness.<br>
[051] For all of these high brightness layouts, it is possible to discuss a "Figure of Merit"<br>
(FOM) to help compare the performance of these layouts. A simplified FOM might be the number<br>
of pixels expressed by the MTFL in each axis divided by the subpixels, expressed as a percentage.<br>
[052] For example, the conventional RGBW "Quad" pattern which has as a repeating<br>
group:<br>
in a square pattern.<br>
[053] For large billboards, the Quad pattern is implemented by four incandescent lamps<br>
arranged in a square pattern repeat unit. The colored primaries are formed by pigment paints on the<br>
lamps. The brightness loss is sipificant, thus the unfiltered white lamp provides much needed<br>
brightness. The Quad pattern is typically treated as a square pixel. Although subpixel rendering<br>
may be applied (and thus improve), the Quad pattern is not as optimal as the novel layouts<br>
disclosed herein - as the Quad requires two lines of subpixels in any axis to draw a single white<br>
line. Since it takes four subpixels to equal one 'pixel', the FOM value is 25%.<br>
[054] Figure 8 is yet another embodiment substantially comprising repeating group 802<br>
with its subpixels in a 1:2 aspect ratio. This layout may have less edge boundaries that give rise to<br>
liquid crystal disinclinations, and thus has higher contrast than an LCD based on the RGBW Quad<br>
and even the RGB Stripe. This layout, like the Quad above, has 25% white area, thus it can have<br>
approximately 75% to 100% higher brightness than an RGB Stripe panel with the same resolution.<br>
It should be noted that each color is on a square grid at 45°. This layout requires only one row of<br>
subpixels to draw a single white line, while it still requires two subpixel columns. Thus, the Figure<br>
of Merit value is thus 50%.<br>
[055] Figure 9 is yet another embodiment substantially comprising repeating group 902. It<br>
may be advantageous for very high resolution (300+ dpi) mobile phones. As blue resolution is<br>
reduced in this layout, it may be desirable to use a high color temperature backlight to ensure that<br>
enough blue light is available to keep the panel at a desired white color when all of the subpixels<br>
are turned on to full value. As the white area is only 17%, the brightness increase is approximately<br>
50%. The aspect ratio of the subpixels may be two-to-three (2:3) (or alternatively 1:3). For the<br>
layout of Figure 9, it may be seen that the FOM for this layout is 66%.<br>
[056] Figure 10 is yet another embodiment having subpixel repeating group 1002. As the<br>
subpixels remain at one-to-three (1:3) aspect ratio, it may be easy to utilize existing backplanes for<br>
this layout. This layout would then have a higher MTFL in the horizontal axis than the<br>
conventional RGB it replaces. It would also be approximately 75% brighter. The additional<br>
horizontal resolution may further reduce moire distortion. If the input signal has higher resolution,<br>
such as scaling down a 10801 signal to a 720p HDTV LCD, or 720p on a 480i TV, this panel may<br>
show up to 50% higher horizontal resolution than the RGB Stripe panel, thus showing the full<br>
horizontal resolution of the higher resolution format.<br>
[057] Figure 11A is yet another embodiment of a high brightness layout having a 4 x 8<br>
subpixel repeating group 1102. As may be seen, the subpixels are of a different shape than the<br>
traditional rectangular. The white subpixels (shown withont hatching) are the majority subpixels<br>
and are optionally of a smaller size or dimension as the colored subpixels which comprise red,<br>
green, blue and cyan in this embodiment. As may be seen, the white subpixels could be interstitial<br>
(e.g. displaced 180 degrees) to the colored subpixels. As may also be seen, the subpixel repeating<br>
group 1102 is larger than the other ones shown in the other figures because the color subpixels are<br>
placed on a hex grid. One possible advantage of a hex grid is that it tends to scatter the Fourier<br>
energies in more directions and points. This may be especially useful for the dark luminance wells<br>
caused by the blue subpixels. Another possible advantage is that each row contains all four colors<br>
as well as the white subpixels, allowing for horizontal lines to be black and white, fully sharpened,<br>
without chromatic aliasing. It will be appreciated that all of the subpixel repeating groups in all of<br>
the Figures shown herein may also be placed on a hex grid in a similar fashion and is contemplated<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[058] Figure 1 IB is yet another embodiment of a high brightness layout where the white<br>
majority subpixels are vertically displaced from the minority subpixels. This tends to expand the<br>
SPR Moire Limit to a full circle. If the layouts have a square grid of white subpixels, the<br>
monochromatic MTF Limit displayed is a square MTF Limit boundary, matching that of the<br>
conventional RGB stripe system. It will be appreciated that all of the layouts disclosed herein may<br>
be made to have the white subpixels so vertically displaced and the scope of the present invention<br>
encompasses these alternatives. Figure 11C is yet another embodiment of a high brightness layout<br>
in which a white subpixel replaces a blue subpixel in a delta triad pattern. Although the subpixels<br>
are shown as dots in Figure 11C, they may, of course, be implemented as rectangular subpixels - or<br>
in many other shapes - as desired.<br>
[059] As was mentioned above, LCD contrast is set by many parameters, including light<br>
leakage from disclinations or other LC distortions around the edges of subpixels. To cancel the<br>
light coming from these regions, the black matrix may be enlarged to cover this region. This may<br>
reduce light transmission, but also may improves contrast. Figure 12 shows one possible<br>
embodiment. Black matrix is enlarged, adjacent to colored filter 1202, and tends to hide the<br>
disinclination regions 1206 below.<br>
[060] In many of the embodiments disclosed herein (as well as in many applications<br>
incorporated herein), the layout uses subpixels that are wider than normal RGB stripe, which tends<br>
to result in 10-100% increase in aperture ratio, depending on pixel density. The black matrix may<br>
be held constant and the light transmission increases. However, it may also be desirable to "give<br>
up" some of the light transmission gain and increase the black matrix width to cover more of the<br>
disclination region at the edge of the pixel. This may improve the overall contrast by reducing the<br>
dark state brightness of the LCD. The bright state brightness may be higher owing to the increased<br>
transmission; thus the contrast ratio will be improved. Further, roe black matrix may be<br>
differentially adjusted for different colored regions, subpixels, such that the brighter subpixels, such<br>
as white, green, or even cyan, have more area at the periphery covered by the black matrix to reduce<br>
leakage from the disinclinations, thus increasing the contrast while maintaining to some degree, the<br>
saturated brightness of the darker colors such as red and blue. Each of the colored subpixels may<br>
be thus adjusted independently, as desired. For example, the white may have the most area covered<br>
by the black matrix to have the greatest impact on the contrast of images.<br>
[061] While disclinations have been described as the source of light leakage around the<br>
edges of pixels, the present invention is not restricted to this phenomenon alone. In other designs,<br>
light leakage may be caused by field effects caused by the edge of electrodes, such as chevron<br>
patterns in MVA or IPS designs. The enlarged black matrix will help hide these sources of light<br>
leakage as well, ft should be appreciated that this concept applies equally well to layout that are 3-<br>
color (i.e. using only red, green and blue as subpixels) or other multiprimary layout (i.e. not using<br>
white as a subpixel) - as well as any RGBW design.<br>
 [062] Although the layouts as described herein are suitable to LCD displays, these layouts<br>
find equal application in the area of incandescent lamp based displays, Light Emitting Diode (both<br>
organic and inorganic) based displays, Plasma display panels (PDF) and many other various display<br>
technologies.<br>
[063] Figure 13 is one embodiment of a delta triad subpixel layout substantially<br>
corresponding to the color assignments in Figure 11C. Of course, the present invention subsumes<br>
mirror images and other symmetries of this particular embodiment.<br>
[064] Figures 14 and 15 are additional embodiments that are similar to Figures 2 and 3<br>
wherein further the individual colored subpixels are placed on hex grid, as opposed to a square grid.<br>
[065] Figure 16 is an additional embodiment that is similar to Figure 4 but further wherein<br>
the colored subpixels form a different diagonal striping pattern as seen in Figure 4.<br>
[066] Figure 17 is another embodiment that is similar to Figure 11A but wherein the single<br>
color planes are placed on a square grid as opposed to a hex grid.<br>
[067] Figures 18 through 24 arc embodiments of other Figures previously shown herein -<br>
but with the white subpixels displaced as shown.<br>
[068] Figures 25, 26, 27 and 28 are embodiments of several of Figures previously shown<br>
herein - but depicted in mirror image.<br>
[069] While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment,<br>
it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents<br>
may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In<br>
addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the<br>
teachings without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the<br>
invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for<br>
carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the<br>
