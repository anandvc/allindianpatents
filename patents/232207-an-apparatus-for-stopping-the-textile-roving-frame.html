AN APPARATUS FOR STOPPING TEXTILE ROVING FRAME Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a textile roving frame of a textile machine, particularly to an apparatus for sensing the displacement or lifting of the bobbin from the bobbin trough and to stop the machine in order to prevent the breakage of center spindle attached to the flyer. Baclcground and prior art<br>
Roving frame or fly frame is a spinning preparatory machine. The fibre material in the form of sliver arranged in sliver cans being fed to the drafting arrangement of the roving frame driven by the drive system of the machine and drafted as roving.The fibre roving is produced and wound in parallel windings onto the bobbin of each spinning position, using a flyer. A flyer normally has fingers which deposit the roving on the core sleeve also known as bobbin.<br>
As the fibre roving is to be a draftable input material to be fed to the next processing step, a very low twist is imparted to it, barely sufficient for tensionless transfer of the fibre roving to a drafting arrangement of the subsequent processing step. In roving frames the bobbin are arranged on a bobbin trough and driven by a drive means. The flyer, which distributes the fibre roving over the bobbin surface rotates coaxially with bobbin , and furthermore means are provided to precisely adjust the mutual rotational speeds between the flyer and the bobbin.<br>
In this arrangement the flyer, as a rule, rotates at a constant rotational speed, while the rotational speed of the bobbin is adapted according to the increasing bobbin diameter. The bobbin trough performs the reciprocating stroke between two reversal points moving with respect to space as a function of the bobbin diameter, this traversing stroke ensuring for both the winding of the fiber roving in parallel windings onto the bobbin surface and the conical built or formed shape of the bobbin extremities. The bobbin comprises a base portion provided with radial slots to drivingly connect the bobbin with the driver key provided in the bobbin drive means. Soon after the predetermined length of roving being wound on the bobbin, the machine is stopped, the flyers are removed from their spindles and the bobbins are doffed. Subsequently empty bobbins are loaded on the winding posifion and the flyers are re fixed on the spindle and the winding cycle is initiated.<br><br>
Modem roving frames are being employed for the production of bobbing packages of<br>
relatively larger diameter and lift to enhance the efficiency of the roving frame as well<br>
as the spinning frame on w^hich the roving bobbins are subsequently converted in to<br>
yam. Such machine employs suspended flyers in which the flyers need not be removed<br>
from the spindles for the exchange of full bobbins with empty bobbins.<br>
A central spindle is attached to the suspended flyers, which guides the bobbin through a<br>
cylindrical bore provided on the top portion of the bobbin during its up and down travel<br>
for the bobbin built up.<br>
In practice it is observed that the bobbin getting displaced vertically from the bobbin<br>
drive means during the downward movement of the bobbin trough due to reasons like<br>
a)	fiber accumulation in the center spindle of the flyer which hinders the free guidance of bobbin over the center spindle resulting in the bobbin struck up with the center spindle.<br>
b)	misalignment of the axis of bobbin and the center spindle due to reasons like bend introduced in the center spindle by mishandling, bobbins with inaccurate center hole. The vertical displacement of the bobbin from the bobbin trough results in the engagement of the bobbin with the center spindle, which exerts undue centrifugal force on the center spindle resulting in the breaking of the center spindle. At times, the broken center spindle may be thrown out of the machine resulting in accidents, which are undesirable.<br>
Object of the present invention<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for stopping the<br>
textile roving frame whenever there is a displacement of bobbin during roving.<br>
An object of the present invention is provide an apparatus for stopping the textile<br>
roving frame by sensing the vertical displacement or lifting of the bobbin of a textile<br>
roving frame of a textile machine from the bobbin drive element.<br>

Description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus to sense the vertical displacement of bobbin from the bobbin drive elements arranged on the bobbin trough of a textile roving frame and to stop the machine. The embodiments of the present invention are described by referring to the accompanied diagrams Figs 1-4.  We refer<br><br>
initially to Fig 1 of the present invention, wherein cross sections of the flyer trough and the bobbin trough incorporated with the sensing arrangement according to the present invention using through beam type photo sensors is illustrated. While the right hand side section is shown with the cover of the bobbin drive means, the left hand side section is illustrated without the cover of the bobbin drive gear for clarity. In the present invention as an exemplary embodiment the bobbin drive element is in the form of pulley driven by endless belt is considered. However, the subject matter of the invention is equally applicable to other bobbin driving elements that are used in driving the bobbin. It may also be noted that for the sake of understanding of the various elements described, the left hand side section is shown with one bobbin with roving built over it and two empty bobbins mounted on the bobbin drive element. Also the drive elements of the bobbin are excluded.<br>
The drafted roving is fed to the center hole of the flyer (1) through the false twister (2) for incorporating false twist sufficient for tensionless transfer of the roving to the drafting zone of the textile spinning machine. The roving is laid over the bobbin (3) by the finger (4) attached to the flyer (1). The flyers being arranged on a flyer trough (5) and driven by the flyer drive system of the roving frame in one of the known ways. The bobbin (3) being arranged in the bobbin trough(7) and driven by the bobbin drive element attached to the bobbin drive system of the roving frame in one of the known ways.<br>
The bobbin (3) comprises a base portion (6) provided with radial slots for drivable engagement with the driver key provided in the bobbin drive element. The bobbin drive element is arranged on the bobbin trough (7). The bobbin trough (7) carrying the plurality of the bobbins are traversed up and down for the bobbin built up. A center spindle (8) attached to the flyer (1) guides the bobbin (3) through a cylindrical bore (9) provided on the top portion of the bobbin (3) during the up and down travel of the bobbin trough (7).<br>
The invention employs a sensing arrangement using a plurality of sensing arrangement comprising photo emitters and receiver photo sensor photo sensors, to check and ensure that all the bobbins are seated properly on the bobbin drive element. The photo emitter disposed to generate an uninterrupted optical beam, said emitter is disposed at one end of the bobbin trough, a receiver photo sensor disposed to receive said beam, said receiver photo sensor photo sensor is disposed on the opposite end of<br><br>
the bobbin trough, said receiver photo sensor photo sensor disposed to sense the vertical displacement of the bobbin from the bobbin drive element in the form of absence of the beam at the receiver photo sensor and to generate corresponding digital interrupt signal. It may be noted that when the bobbin filled with roving is vertically displaced from the bobbin drive element for reasons like struck up of the bobbin with the center spindle, the base portion of the bobbin is no more supported and the un supported bobbin exerts undue centrifugal force on the center spindle which results in the breakage of the center spindle Once the center spindle is broken , the center spindle which was revolving at higher rotational speeds is throw out along with the bobbin stuck to it, which pose great danger to the operative of the textile roving frame as well as to the machine. A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) member operably connected to said receiver photo sensor to receive the generated digital interrupt signal on one side and on the other side connected to control circuit and to arrest the rotary drive arrangement of the textile roving frame, and an output member to display the stoppage of the textile roving frame.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, wherein the photo sensor is a diffused beam sensor, a through beam sensor or retroflex type sensor.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the control circuit further comprising a digital analog converter and an inverter.<br>
For the sake of understanding of the invention, the working of the invention using through beam type photo sensing arrangement is explained. These sensors comprise photo emitter (10) and a receiver photo sensor photo sensor (11) members. Now by specifically referring to Fig 1, while the photo emitter (10) is fitted to one end of the bobbin trough for example at the drive end, the receiver photo sensor (11) to the other end of the machine for example the offend or opposite end of the bobbin trough. The photo emitter (10) and the receiver photo sensor photo sensor (11) arranged such that the light beam LB (12) emitted by the photo emitter (10) just passes through the region in the proximity of the outer diameter of the bobbin just above the base portion (6) of the bobbin (3). During the working of the machine, whenever a bobbin (3) is vertically displaced from the bobbin drive element, base portion (6) of the bobbin (3) obstructs the narrow light beam LB (12) emitted by the photo emitter (10) of the sensing arrangement. Once the narrow light beam LB (12) is interrupted the emitted light is no more received by the receiver photo sensor (11). The interruption of the light beam is<br><br>
communicated to the PLC by the receiver photo sensor in the form of signal . The PLC is programmed to verify the uninterrupted light beam from the emitter is received by the receiver photo sensor. In the event of uninterrupted receipt of the beam by the receiver photo sensor, the roving process on the bobbin is continued. However, in the event of disruption or interruption of the light beam at the receiver photo sensor due to the vertical displacement of the bobbin while in operation, the photo sensor receiver sends an interrupt digital signal to the PLC. The PLC processes the received digital signal and sends its instructions in the form of a digital signal to a Dighal to Analog Converter (DAC). Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) receives the digital instructions from the PLC and converts the same to analog signal and sends to an Inverter. Inverter receives the analog signal from the DAC and stops the motors of the drive circuit. Thus, displacement of bobbin by lifting from its position is sensed and the machine stopped to prevent accidents. The message "flyer safety sensor actuated" is displayed at the output member. The out put member can be any compatible digital display unit.<br>
With this arrangement the breakage or bending of flyer spindles are totally prevented<br>
and hence safety to the machine and the personnel operating the machine are ensured.<br>
Advantages<br>
1. In the present invention, the vertical displacement of the bobbin from the bobbin<br>
drive element is detected well in advance, the machine is stopped and the breakage of<br>
the center spindle and its subsequent consequences are averted.<br><br><br><br>
