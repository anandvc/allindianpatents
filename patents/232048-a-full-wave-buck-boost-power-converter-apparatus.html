				<td>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
1.         Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a full wave buck-boost converter. More particularly, the invention relates to the advantageous integration of the previously integrated buck-boost converter form with the fundamental buck converter form.<br>
2,   Discussion o£ Prior,Art<br>
Three basic circuit families are commonly used in switchmode power supplies; namely, buck, boost, and buck-boost (commonly known as "flyback") The buck-boost (flyback) converter is probably the earlieot example o£ advantageous integration of the fundamental buck and boost converter forms. Although some authority treats the buck-boost converter as a fundamental form, another body of opinion holds that the buck-boost converter is an integrated form.<br>
Whatever, the genesis of the buck-boost converter form, there is consensus of authority regarding a typological property of the continuous mode control-to-outrut transfer- function of both the buck boost converter form, M = D/(l~D), and the boost converter form, M - 1/(1-<br>
D). Thia consensus holds that there is present in ALL continuous mode, PWM controlled/ fixed frequency, switch mode boost and buck-boost converter forms a non-minimum phase property, the right half s-plane zero, Dubbed the RHP zero, this first-order property is attributable to the inductor current/load current discontinuity consequential<br><br>
to the (1-D) term. This RHP aero never occurs in circuits of the buck family. This RHP zero has been addressed with wry humor "A right-half-plane zero is included in every boost-derived converter transfer function at no extra .cost", a measure of vituperation "very nasty right half plane zero", and a sort of despair "impossible to compensate". The non-existence of a buck-boost (flyback) converter form equivalent to the full-wave buck (forward) converter form has been asserted. Diverse efforts to mitigate this RHP zero •include discontinuous mode operation, leading edge modulation, power and control component value manipulation, and average current mode control techniques. Contemporary converter control loop compensation teaching extensively addresses the need for effective containment of this RHP zero effect,<br>
Postulated in 1967, and analytically confirmed in 1972, this RHP zero effect has been the subject of continuous and intense scrutiny for more than two decades. The juatification for this effort is found in the collective of advantageous properties of the buck-boost converter form, among which are simplicity/ ease of multiple-output implementation, the compound voltage transfer function, wide input line range, reduced semiconductor stress, load protection, and the same power densities and efficiencies as forward (buck) converters,<br>
This RHP zero effect notwithstanding, 'the buck-boost converter form (flyback) has found widespread usage in power conversion applications, with proprietary work in both single-ended and full-wave configurations as well as extensive public domain effort.<br>
The foregoing discussion, along with well established application criteria, makes it abundantly clear<br>
that    th&amp;    alrenriy    vsry    pooulsr    buck-boost     converter  from<br>
would find substantially greater utility if this RHP zero effect were eliminated.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is a continuous mode, full wave, buck-boost (flyback), PWH controlled, fixed frequency, switch mode power converter in which a single flux permutation medium (energy storage inductor) is so interposed (coupled) between alternating (transformed) source-to-load switching means as to simultaneously provide the canonical buck-boost converter voltage transfer function, M = D/(1-D), aa well as the characteristic full wave buck inductor current property of being source continuous during the alternate D intervals, source discontinuous during the simultaneous (1-D) intervals, and load continuous during both the alternate D and simultaneous (1-D) intervals.<br>
Since the RH.P zero never occurs in circuits of the buck family, this converter topology does not exhibit the characteristic boost-derived RHP zero described in the Discussion o£ Prior Art, while retaining all other intrinsic full wave buck-boost properties. Responsive to conventional control means, loop bandwidth i-s limited only by the theoretical sampling rate maxima.<br>
The entire power magnetic function, i.e., both inductance and transformation (isolation) may be obtained in a single magnetic component, the flyback equivalent of the full wave forward converter with a single transformer core.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
For the purpose of explanation of the invention, assume ideal switches, unidirectional conducting devices, and magnetics. The idealized magnetic properties include the conventional low reluctance magnetic core structure for the transformers T1l arid T12, hereinafter discussed, and the conventional relatively higher reluctance magnetic core structure for L BO realized as to obtain the requisite ampere turns (magnetomotive force) identity. The M term is ideal the ideal voltage transfer ratio, expressed in terms of D, The D term is a switch closed period tOM/ expressed as a function of (T). The (T) term is one full wave cycle of operation, expressed as an arbitrary time unit of one.<br>
1,	Referring now to FIGURES 3 and 3A, the timing,<br>
voltage,  and  current  identities  are  expressed  in<br>
(T)(A)(E)(F)  and  (H)  of  FIGURE  6,  with the attendant<br>
timing, voltage, arid current expressions. Given n = 0.5, it<br>
is seen that application of alternating (full-wave) switch<br>
means to the voltage transfer function of the prior art<br>
buck-derived circuit of FIGURE 3 will express the 2D term,<br>
i.e., M- n2D/{l+2D(n-l}  =  0,5(2D)/1+2D(-0.5)  =  D/(l-<br>
D) .    This  expression  is  precisely analogous  to  the<br>
conventional full-wave buck converter in which the D term,<br>
as applied to each switch, is effectively doubled by the Et<br>
equivalency characteristic of the full wave buck inductor,<br>
i.e., in steady state operation, the voltage across the<br>
inductor, averaged over each switching cycle must be zero.<br>
[(Ein - Eout)2D] + [-Bout(l-2D) ] = 0, 2DEin -3DEout- - Eout<br>
 = 0, 2DEin - Eout = 0, Eout ~ 2DEin, M = 2D.<br>
2.	Referring now to FIGURE 7 and 7A, the timing,<br>
voltage and current identities are expressed in (T), (A),<br>
(B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), (I), (J), (K), (L), and<br>
(M) of FIGURE 6, with the attendant timing, voltage, and<br>
current expressions.<br>
Alternate closure tON of switch Sll or S12 will express Ein across Np, NT, and Ns of the corresponding transformer Til or T12. The corresponding unidirectional conducting<br><br>
means Dll or D12 will be non-conducting, Combined transformer and inductor action will express Eout across Np, NT, and NS of the non-corresponding transformer Til or T12 via the conducting non-corresponding unidirectional conducting means Dll or D12. The series combination of Np of Til with NT of T12 and the series combination of NT of Til with Np of T12 are configured and polarized to express the voltage Ein - 'Eout, i.e., voltage (A) during either tON interval. These series combinations are connected in parallel across the inductor L, thus interposing the inductor L in series between Ein and Eout, via the conducting non-corresponding unidirectional conducting means Dll or D12. The inductor L current (G) is continuous with the source current (E), either switch current (I) or (.J), either unidirectional conducting means current (L) or (M), and output current (H), during either tON interval.<br>
Simultaneous opening of switch Sll and S12 will permit polarity reversal of the voltage (A) in consequence of conventional ampere turns (magnetomotive force) conservation in inductor L. Unidirectional conducting means Dll and D12 both conduct, expressing the voltage Eout across Ns of Til and Ns of T12, which voltage Eout ia expressed across the inductor L by the Til and T12 transformation ratio (Np 4- NT) / Ns, or 2:1. The voltage (A) is -2Eout during either (T/2~tON) interval. The Et equivalency of the full-wave flyback inductor L of FIGURE 7A is expressed as [(Ein - Eout)2D] 4- (-2Eout(l-2D)] = 0, 2DEin - 2DEout - 2Eout + 4DEout = 0, 3-DEin - SEout 4- S-DEout =. 0, DEin 4- DEout = Eout, DEin = Eout -DEout, EinD « Eout (1-D), Eout = Ein [D/(l-D)j, M = D/(1-D), again taking the D term as alternately applied to the switch means. The inductor L current (G) is parallel transformed to output current (H) by the ratio NS/(NP 4- NT), or 1:2. Each unidirectional conducting means conducts current (K) , the sum of which currents is current (F) . The inductor L<br>
current.       (G)       is.      Simultaneously	continuous    with      each<br>
unidirectxon conducting means current (K) and the output<br><br>
current (H) during either (T/2~tON) interval. The inductor L current (G) is source continuous during the on interval tDN of either switch means Sll or 312, source discontinuous during the oimultaneous; off interval (T/2-tON) of switch means Sll and 512, and output continuous during both the tON and (T/2-tQN) intervals. Accordingly, IL = IM, IR(LOAD)) = 2DIH + 2IH, IR(LOAM = 2IN[D+
R(LOAD) •<br>
3.	Referring now to FIGURES 8 and 8A, the timing,<br>
voltage and current identities are expressed in (T), (A),<br>
(B), (C), (D) (E), (F), (G), (H), (I), (J), (K), (L), and<br>
(M) of FIGURE 6 with the attendant timing, voltage, and<br>
current  expressions.    This  circuit  is  functionally<br>
identical to that of FIGURES 7 and 7A save that the voltage<br>
(A), as expressed across the inductor L, is evolved by<br>
integration of Til and T12 into a single low reluctance<br>
magnetic core structure. The inductor L retains a separate<br>
relatively higher reluctance magnetic core structure.<br>
Flux-summing of Kin as expressed across either Np, and Eout<br>
as expressed across either non-corresponding Ns,  produces<br>
the N-, voltage(s) Ein-Eout during the tQN interval.  Flux-<br>
sumnung of the simultaneous expression of Eout across each<br>
NS during the (T/2~t0N) intervals produces the NT voltage(s),<br>
~2Eout.    The  magnetic  integration  and  flux-summing<br>
techniques are well established in the power conversion<br>
discipline.	<br>
4.	Referring now to FIGURES 9 and 9A, ' the timing,<br>
voltage and current identities are expressed in (T), (A),<br>
(B), (C), (D), (EJ, (F), (H), (I), (J), (K), (L), and (M)<br>
of FIGURE 6, with the attendant timing, voltage, and<br>
current  expressions.    This  circuit  is  functionally<br>
identical to that of FIGURE 7 and 7A, save that the voltage<br>
(A), as expressed acrosB the imaginary winding NEMF, is again<br>
an  analog of  the  ampere-turns  (magnetomotive  force)<br><br>
identity. The NL and NT winding(s) are integrated into Til and T12. The outer legs of the magnetic structure retain the relatively low reluctance property. The relatively higher reluctance magnetic prQperty of the indicator L is integrated into the magnetic structure center leg, The average of inductor current (G) is now IH, the higher reluctance magnetic current, a composite of currents (I),(J) and (K), The magnetic integration and flux-summing techniques share the provenance of those of paragraph 3, as well as the two-bobbin derivation.<br>
5.	Referring now to FIGURES 4 and 4A, the timing,<br>
voltage and current identities are expressed in (T), (A),<br>
(B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (H), (I), (J), (K), (L), and (M)<br>
of FIGURE 6, with the attendant timing, voltage, and<br>
current  expressions.    This  circuit  is  functionally<br>
identical to the circuit of FIGURES 9 and 9A, absent the Ns<br>
windings in this non-isolated embodiment.<br>
6.	Referring now to FIGURES 5 and SA, the timing,<br>
voltage and current identities are expressed in (T), (A),<br>
(B), (C), (D), (B), (F), (H), (I), (J), (K),(L), and (M)<br>
of FIGURE 6, with the attendant timing, voltage, and<br>
current  expressions.    This  circuit  is  functionally<br>
identical to the circuit of FIGURES 9 and 9A, with the<br>
addition of the N windings in this isolated, multiple<br>
output embodiment.<br><br>
7,	Referring now to FIGURE 1, this circuit embodies<br>
the canonical form of the invention and is functionally<br>
independent  of  voltage  polarities  and  source/load<br>
direction.   Single, two, three, and four quadrant mode<br>
function is evident,<br>
8,	The foregoing and other features of the invention<br>
(such as recited in the SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION) will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading this<br>
disclosure.  it will be equally apparent that, for any<br>
given  mode  of  operation,  control  means  CM  can  be<br>
implemented in manifold ways  Also eaually obvious is that<br>
the topology may be redeployed and augmented to configure<br><br>
all prior art full wave and polyphase circuit geometries, i.e., half-bridge, full-bridge, etc.<br>
Other applications, variations, and ramifications o£ this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure. These appreciations are intended to be included within the scope of this invention, as defined in the eippended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
