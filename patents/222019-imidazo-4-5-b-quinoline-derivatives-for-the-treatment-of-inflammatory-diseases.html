described, whereby each reaction step can be carried out as specified by way of example in the following exam- pies or analogously or similarly thereto or as known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In a first reaction step the nitro group of the commercially available 4-nitro-2-picoline-N-oxide is ade is ex- changed by a l-4C-alkoxy group. The resulting 4- (l-4C)-alkoxy-2-picoline-N-oxide (compound of for- mula Viril) is then converted via a rearrangement into a compound of formula VI, which is oxidized to give 4-(l-4C)-alkoxy-pyridin-2-carbaldehyde (compound of formula VI).<br>
The carbon chain in 2-position of the compounds of formula VI is lengthened, for example, by a con- densation (with a malonic acid derivative) and a subsequent hydrogenation reaction. Alternatively, the carbon chain can be lengthened using a Wittig reaction followed by a hydrogenation reaction.<br>
In the last step the methyl 3- (4- (l-4C)-alkoxypyridin-2-yl) propionate (compound of formula) IV) or the corresponding acid (compound of formula Hi) are converted with a 2, 3-diaminoquinoline derivative (compound of formula 11) to give the compounds of formula 1.<br>

The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with the reaction condi- tions which are specifically necessary for carrying out the N-oxidation.<br>
It is known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by pro- tective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A de- tailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991.<br>
The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or sub- jecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as column chromatography on a suitable support material.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (for example a ketone like acetone, methylethylketone, or methylisobutylketone, an ether, like diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol) which contains the desired acid, or to which the desired acid is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a non- solvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by basi- fication into the free compounds which, in turn, can be converted into salts. In this manner, pharma- cologically non-tolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologicallytolerable salts.<br>

Commercial applicability The compounds according to the invention have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. They are selective inhibitors of the enzyme inducib ! e nitric oxide synthase.<br>
Nitric oxide synthases (NO-syntases, NOSs) are enzymes that generate NO and cdrulline from the amino acid arginin. In certain pathophysiological situations such as arginine depletion ortetrahydro-biopterin depletion the generation of 02 from NO-synthases instead or together with NO has been reported. NO is long known as a signalling molecule in most living organisms including mammals and humans. The most prominent action of NO is ifs smooth muscle relaxing activity, which is caused on the molecular level by the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. In the last years a lot of other en- zymes have been shown to be regulated by NO or reaction products of NO.<br>
There exist three isoforms of NO-synthases which fall into two classes and differ in their physiologic functions and molecular properties. The first class, known as constitutive NO-synthases, comprises of the endothelial NO-synthase and the neuronal NO-synthase. Both is nzymes are expressed constitu- tively in various cell types, but are most prominent in endothelial cells of blood vessel walls (therefore called endothelial NO-synthase, ENOS or NOS-III) and in neuronal cells (therefore called neuronal NO- synthase, nNOS or NOS-I). Activation of these two enzymes is dependent on Ca25/Calmodulin which is generated by transient increases of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentraGon. Activation of constitutive isoforms leads to transient bursts of nitric oxide resulting in nanomolar cellular or tissue NO concentra- tions. The endothelial isoform is involved in the physiologic regulation of blood pressure. NO generated by the neuronal isoform seems to have neurotransmitter function and the neuronal isoform is among other regulator processes involved in memory function (long term potentiation).<br>
14<br><br>
In contrast to the constitutive isoforms the activation of inducibie NO-synthase (iNOS, NOS-II), the sole membar of the second class, is performed by transcriptional activation of the iNOS-promoter. Proin- flammatory stimuli lead to transcription of the gene for inducible NO-synthase, which is catalytically active without increases in the intracellular Ca2-concentration. Due to the long half live of the inducible NO-synthase and the unregulated activity of the enzyme, high micromolar concentrations of NO are generated over longer time periods. These high NO-concentrations atone or in cooperation with other reactive radicals such as 02-are cytotoxic. Therefore, in situations of microbial infections, iNOS is in- volved in cell killing by macrophages and other immune cells during early nonspecific immune re- sponses.<br>
There are a number of pathophysiological situations which among others are characterized by the high expression of inducible NO-synthase and concomitant high NO or Oiconcentrations It has been shown that these high NO concentrations alone or in combination with other radical species lead to tissue and organ damage and are causally involved in these pathophysiologies. As inflammation is characterized by the expression of proinflammatory enzymes, including inducible NO-synthase, acute and chronical inflammatory processes are promising diseases for the therapeutic application of selec- tive inhibitors of inducible NO-synthase. Other pathophysiologies with high NO-production from indue- ible NO-synthase are several forms of shock (septic, hemorrhagic and cytokine-induced).<br>
It is dear that nonselective NO-synthase inhibitors will lead to cardiovascular and neuronal side effects due to concomitant inhibition of constitutive NO-synthase isoforms.<br>
It has been shown in in-vivo animal models of septic shock that reduction of circulating plasma NO- levels by NO-scavenger or inhibition of inducible NO-synthase restores systemic blood pressure, re- duces organ damage and increases survival (deAngelo Exp. Opin. Pharmacother. 19-29,1999; Redl et al. Shock 8, Suppl. 51,1997; Strand et al. CritCare Med. 26,1490-1499,1998). It has also been shown that increased NO production during septic shock contributes to cardiac depression and myo- cardial dysfunction (Sun et al. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 30, 989-997, 1998). Furthermore there are also re- ports showing reduced infarct size after occlusion of the left anterior coronary artery in the presence of NO-synthase inhibitors (Wang et al. Am. J. Hyperttens. 12, 174-182, 1999). Considerable inducible NO-synthase activity is found in human cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, supporting the hypothesis that NO accounts at least in part for the dilatation and impaired contractility in these pathophysiologies (de Belder et al. Br. Heart. J. 4, 426-430, 1995).<br>
In animal models of acute or chronic inflammation, blockade of inducible NO-synthase by isoform-selective or nonseledive inhibitors or genetic knock out improves therapeutic outcome. It is reported that experimental arthritis (Connor et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 273, 15-24, 1995) and osteoarthntis (Pelle- tier et al. Arthritis &amp; Rheum. 41, 1275-1286, 1998), enperimentat inflammations of the gastro-intestinal tract (Zingarelli et al. Gut 45, 199-209, 1999), experimental glomerulonephritis (Narita et al. Lab. Invest.<br>
72, 17-24, 1995), experimental diabetes (Corbett et al. PNAS 90, 8992-8995, 1993), LPS-induced ex- perimental lung injury is reduced by inhibition of inducible NO-synthase or in iNOS-knock out mice (Kristof et al. Am. J. Crit Care. Med. 158, 1SS3-18S9 1998). A pathophysiological role of indicible NO- synthase derived NO or Os'is aiso discussed in chronic inflammatory diseases such es asthma, bron- chits and COPD.<br>

15<br><br>
2000), malo- nate induced HunHngton's disease (Connop etai. NeuropharmacoL 35, 459-465, 1996), experimental menengitis (Korytko &amp; Boje Neuropharmacol. 35, 231-237, 1996) and experimental encephalitis (Park- inson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75, 174-186, 1997) a causal participation of NO and inducible NO-synthase has been shown.<br>
Increased iNOS expression has been found in the brains of AIDS victims and it is reasonable to assume a role of iNOS in AIDS related dementia (Bagasra et al. J. Neurovirol. 3 153-167,1997).<br>
Other studies implicated nitric oxide as a potential mediator of microglia dependent primary demyelina- tion, a hallmark of multiple skierosis (Parkinson et al. J. Mol. Med. 75,174-186,1997).<br>
An inflammatory reaction with concomitant expression of inducible NO-synthase also takes place dur- ing cerebral ischemia and roperfusion (ladecola et al. Stroke 27, 1373-1380, 1996). Resulting NO to- gether with 02- from infiltrating neutrophils is thought to be responsible for cellular and organ damage.<br>
Also, in models of traumatic brain injury (Mesenge et al. J. Neurotrauma 13,209-214, 1996; Wada et al. Neurosurgery 43, 1427-1436, 1998) NO-synthase inhibitors have been show to posses protective properties. A regulator role for inducible NO-synthase has been reported in various tumor cell lines (Tozer &amp; Everett Clin Oncol. 9.357-264, 1997).<br>
On account of their indudble NO-synthase-inhibiting properties, the compounds according to the inven- tion can be employed in human and veterinary medicine and therapeutics, where an excess of NO or Ou'due to increases in the activity of inducible NO-synthase is involved. They can be used without limitation for the treatment and prophylaxis of the following diseases: Acute inflammatory diseases: Septic shock, sepsis, SIRS, hemorrhagic shock, shock states induced by cytokine therapy (IL-2, TNF), organ transplantation and transplant rejection, head trauma, acute lung injury, ARDS, inffammatory skin conditions such as sunburn, inflammatory eye conditions such as uvei- lis, glaucoma and conjunctivitis.<br>
Chronic inflammatory diseases of peripheral organs and the CNS : gastroint3Unal inflammatory dis- eases such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, lung inflammatory dis- eases such as asthma and COPD, arthritic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis, heart disorders such as cardiomyopathy and myocardiUs, artheroskierosis, neurogenic inflammation, skin diseases such as psoriasis, dermatitis and eczema, diabates, glomerulonephritis ; dementia such as dementias of the Alzheimer's type, vascular dementia, dementia due to a general medical condition, such as QIDS-, Parl6inson°s disas, Huntington s induo3d dementias, QLS, multiple sclerosis ; necrotiang vasculitides such as poiyarteritis nodosa, serum sickness, Wegener's granuloma- tosis, Kawasaki's syndrom; headaches such as migraine, chronic tension headaches, cluster and vas- cular headaches, post-traumatic stress disorders ; pain disorders such as neuropathic pain ; myocardial and cerebral ischemia/reperFusin injury.<br>
The compounds may also be useful in the treatment of cancers that express nitric oxide synthase.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for the treatment of mammals, including humans, which are suffering from one of the abovementioned illnesses. The method is characterized in that a therapeuti- cally active and pharmacologically effective and tolerable amount of one or more of the compounds according to the invention is administered to the ill mammal.<br>
16<br><br>
The invention further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of illnesses, especially the illnesses mentioned.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of pharmaceutical compositions which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the compounds according to this invention for the production of pharmaceutical compositions having an iNOS inhibitory activity.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the illnesses mentioned, which contain one or more of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds according to the inven- ton (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and/or exdpients, e. g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, cap- lets, suppositories, patches (e. g. as ITS), emulsions, suspensions, gels or solutions, the active com- pound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95% and where, by the appropriate choice of the auxiliaries and/or excipients, a pharmaceutical administration form (e. g. a delayed release form or an enteric form) exactly suited to the active compound and/or to the desired onset of action can be achieved.<br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar with auxiliaries or excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations on account of his/her expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel for- mers, ointment bases and other active compound excipients, for eetampie antioKidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants, compleing agents or permeation promoters, can be used.<br>
The administration of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be performed in any of the generally accepted modes of administration available in the art. Illustrative examples of suit- able modes of administration include intravenous, oral, nasal, parenteral, topical, transdermal and rec- tal delivery. Oral and intravenous delivery are preferred.<br>
For the treatment of disorders of the respiratory tract, the compounds according to the invention are preferably also administered by inhalation in the form of an aerosol; the aerosol particles of solid, liquid or mixed composition preferably having a diameter of 0.5 to 10 um, advantagously of 2 to 6 pm.<br>
Aerosol generation can be carried out, for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic at- omizers, but advantageously by propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized active compounds from inhalation capsules.<br>
Depending on the inhaler system used, in addition to the active compounds the administration forms additionally contain the required excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e. g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings, fill- ers (e. g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) or, if appropriate, further active compounds.<br>
17<br><br>
For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparatuses are available with which aerosols of optimum partide size can be generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is as right as possible for the patient In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e. g. Nebulator&amp;commat;, VolumatirD), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Au- tohaler&amp;commat;), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e. g. Diskhaler&amp;commat;, Rotadisk&amp;commat;, Turbohaler&amp;commat; or the inhaler described in European Patent Application EP 0 505 321), using which an optimal administration of active compound can be achieved.<br>
For the treatment of dermatoses, the compounds according to the invention are in particular administe- red in the form of those pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for topical application. For the production of the pharmaceutics 1 compositions, the compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are preferably mixed with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries and further processed to give suitable pharmaceutical formulations. Suitabl 'pharmacautical formulations are, for example, powders, emulsions, suspensions, sprays, oils, ointments, fatty ointments, creams, pastes, gels or solutions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are prepared by processes known per se.<br>
The dosage of the active compounds is carried out in the order of magnitude customary for iNOS in- hibitors. Topical application forme (such as ointments) for the treatment of dermatoses thus contain the active compounds in a concentration of, for example, 0.')-99%. The doss for administration by inhala- tion is customary between 0. 1 and 10 mg per day. The customary dose in the case of systemic ther- apy (p. o.) is between 0.3 and 30 mg/kg per day, (i. v.) is between 0. 3 and 30 mg/kg/h.<br>
Biological Investigations Measurement of Inducible NO-synthase activity The assay is performed in 96-well microtiter F-plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, FRG) in a total volume of 100 pi in the presence of 100 nM calmodulin, 226 pM CaC12,477 pM MgCI2 5 pM flavin-adenine- dinucleotide (FAD), 5 pM flavin mononucleotide (FMN), 0.1 mM NADPH, 7 mM glutathione, 10 pM BH4 and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.2. Arginine concentrations are 0.1 pM for enzyme inhibition experiments.<br>
150000 dpm of 13H] arginine are added to the assay mixture. Enzyme reaction is started by the addition of 4 pg of a crude cytosolic fraction containing human inducible NO-synthase and the reaction mixture is incubated for 45 to 60 min at 37°C. Enzyme reaction is stopped by adding 10 NI of 2M MES-buffer pH 5, 0.50 NI of the incubation mixture are transferred into a MADP N65 filtration microtiter plate (Milli- pore, Eschbom, FRG) containing already 50 pi of AG-50W-X8 cation exchange resin (Biorad, Munchen, FRG). The resin in the Na loaded form is pre-equilibrated in water and 70 pi (corresponding to 50 NI dry beads) are pipetted under heavy stirring with a 8 channel pipette into the filtration plate.<br>
After pipetting 50 pi of the enzyme reaction mixture onto the filtration plates, the plates are placed on a filtration manifold (Porvair, Shepperton, UK) and the flow through is collected in Pica scintillation plates (Packard, Maiden, CT). The resin in the filtration plates is washed with 75 pi of water (1x50 pi and lx 25 pi) which is also collected in the same piate as the sample. The total flow through of 125 pi is mixed with 175 NI of Microscint-40 scintillation cocktail (Packard) and the scintillation plate is sealed with TopSeal P-foil (Packard). Scintillation plates are counted in a szintillation counter.<br>
