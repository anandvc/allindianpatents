COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"VEHICLE PROVIDED WITH TRAILER"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan                                                                  The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to vehicle provided with trailer<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle provided with a trailer in which in case the trailer is used for apassenger car, a function of a small turning circle is enhanced, a center of gravity when passengers are seated is lowered, a driver himself/herself can brake the trailer and in addition, the trailer can be detached from the body of the vehicle. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
For exampl.e, a vehicle provided with a trailer disclosed in Japanese published unexamined patent application No. HeilO-59253, "Traction structure of swing-type three-wheeled vehicle" is known. [0003]<br>
In Figs. 1 and 2 in the patent application, traction structure that a coupling member 28 is attached to the rear  of a rear frame 24 of a swing-type three-wheeled vehicle 1<br>
(reference numbers described in the patent application are used as they are) and a coupled part 32 provided to the front of a trailer 7 is coupled to the coupling member 28 is shown.<br>
The trailer 7 is provided with a main frame 30 and right and left wheels 37, 37 are attached to a lower part of the rear of the main frame 30 via a stay 36. [0004]<br>
The structure that an inertia braking system 33 is integrated with the coupled part 32 and in the meantime, the main frame 30 of the trailer 7 is attached to the coupled part 32 so that the main frame can be moved longitudinally of the swing-type three-wheeled vehicle 1 is also shown.<br>
In deceleration, the trailer 7 is moved on the side of the swing-type three-wheeled vehicle 1 by inertia force, an operation cable 74 of the inertia braking system 33 operates a drum brake 73 of a wheel 37 and the wheel 37 is braked. [0005] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In a case that two seats are arranged right and left and two rows each of which includes the two seats are arranged in front and in the rear to seat passengers on the trailer 7 according to the patent application described above, the whole length of the trailer 7 is increased and a function of a small turning circle of the wing-type three-wheeled vehicle 1 for pulling the trailer 7 is deteriorated.<br>
In the case of the structure that passengers are seated on the main frame 3 0 of the trailer 7, a center of gravity on the side of the trailer 7 when the passengers are seated becomes<br>
high and is not desirable. [0006]<br>
As the inertia braking system 33 is operated by only the inertia force of the trailer 7, the trailer cannot be braked by desired control force and at desired timing of a driver seated on the swing-type three-wheeled vehicle 1. [0007]<br>
For means for the driver to brake the wheel 37 of the trailer 7, for example, it is considered that a brake fluid pipe is arranged from the side of the swing-type three wheeled vehicle 1 to the trailer side 7 and a drum brake 73 is operated. If a joint for connecting the side of the swing-type three-wheeled vehicle 1 and the trailer side 7 is provided on the way of the brake fluid pipe, the brake fluid pipe has only to be separated in the joint when the trailer 7 is detached from the swing-type three-wheeled vehicle 1. [0008]<br>
However, the end of the joint is required to be covered with a cap and others to prevent the inside face of the joint from being exposed to the outside and being exposed to rainwater and a cloud of dust. When air is mixed in the brake fluid pipe when the joint is coupled again, air bleeding is required and work becomes troublesome. [0009]<br>
Then, the object of the invention is to enhance a function of a small turning circle in case a trailer is used to carry passengers and in addition, to lower a center of gravity when the passengers are seated (1) , to enable a driver to arbitrarily<br><br>
brake the trailer (2) respectively by improving the vehicle provided with the trailer described above and to facilitate the separation of a pipe for a brake when the trailer is detached from the body of the vehicle in structure that a brake pipe is crossed from the side of the body of the vehicle to the trailer side. [0010] [Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
To achieve the object, Claim 1 is based upon a vehicle provided with a trailer in which a trailer hitch is provided to the rear of the body of the vehicle and the trailer is coupled using the trailer hitch so that the trailer can be detached and is characterized in that passengers can be seated with their backs turned forward by arranging the trailer hitch in front of an axle of a rear wheel on the body side of the vehicle, extending a frame of the trailer to a part above the rear wheel, providing a floor for passengers in the trailer to put their feet in the center of the frame and providing front seats for the passengers to sit to the frame in front of the floor. [0011]<br>
The whole length of the trailer can be reduced by extending the frame of the trailer to the part above the rear wheel on the body side of the vehicle and arranging the front seat on the frame above the rear wheel, as a result, the whole length of the vehicle provided with the trailer can be reduced and the function of a small turning circle can be enhanced.<br>
When the front seat is attached to the frame above the rear wheel of the trailer and the floor is provided below the<br><br>
seat, the center of gravity on the trailer side when passengers are seated can be lowered and the stability of the vehicle provided with the trailer can be enhanced. [0012]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that rear seats for passengers to sit are provided to a frame at the back of a floor.<br>
The number of passengers who take the trailer can be increased by the front seats and the rear seats. [0013]<br>
Claim 3 is based upon a vehicle provided with a trailer in which the trailer is coupled to the rear of the body of the vehicle via a trailer hitch so that the trailer can be detached and is characterized in that a trailer wheel brake for braking a trailer wheel by a driver seated on the body of the vehicle operating is provided to the vehicle, a brake pipe for transmitting the pressure of brake fluid from a part for applying the trailer wheel brake to the trailer wheel side is separated into a pipe on the body side of the vehicle and a pipe on the trailer side halfway, a mechanical force conversion cylinder for once converting the pressure of brake fluid to mechanical force is provided to the end of the pipe on the body side of the vehicle, a master cylinder for housing a second piston that generates the pressure of brake fluid when the second piston is pressed by the end of a first piston provided in the mechanical force conversion cylinder is provided to the end of the pipe on the trailer side and the mechanical force conversion cylinder and the master cylinder are coupled so that they can be detached.<br><br><br>
[0014]<br>
A driver can directly apply the trailer wheel brake by crossing the brake pipe from the body side of the vehicle to the trailer wheel side and the trailer can be braked by desired control force and at desired timing. [0015]<br>
As a passage of brake fluid is not exposed to the outside though the first piston and the second piston are exposed to the outside even if the mechanical force conversion cylinder and the master cylinder are separated when the trailer is detached from the body of the vehicle, a cap and others required in the prior art are not required to be used in the invention, compared with the case that the passage of brake fluid in the following divided joints is required to be covered with a cap and others to protect the passage in case a one touch type joint is used, and the mechanical force conversion cylinder and the master cylinder can be simply separated.
