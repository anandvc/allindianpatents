Provisional Application Serial No. 60/350,107, riled November 2,2001 and United<br>
States Provisional Application Serial No. 60/405,472, filed August 23,2002.<br>
2. FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to substituted diphenyl heterocycles and<br>
compositions thereof useful for treating or preventing Hepatitis C virus (HCV)<br>
infections. In particular, the present invention relates to substituted diphenyl<br>
isoxazole, pyrazole and oxadiazole compounds, compositions comprising the<br>
compounds and the use of such compounds and compositions to inhibit HCV<br>
replication and/or proliferation as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of HCV infections in humans and animals.<br>
3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global human health problem with<br>
approximately 150,000 new reported cases each year in the United States alone. HCV<br>
is a single stranded RNA virus, which is the etiological agent identified in most cases<br>
of non-A, non-B post-transfusion and post-transplant hepatitis and is a common cause<br>
of acute sporadic hepatitis (Choo et al., Science 244:359, 1989; Kuo et al., Science<br>
244:362,1989; and Alter et al, in Current Perspective in Hepatology, p. 83, 1989). It<br>
is estimated that more man 50% of patients infected with HCV become chronically<br>
infected and 20% of those develop cirrhosis of the liver within 20 years (Davis et al,<br>
New Engl. J. Med. 321:1501,1989; Alter et al., in Current Perspective in Hepatology,<br>
p. 83,1989; Alter etal, New Engl. J. Med. 327:1899,1992; and Dienstag<br>
Gastroenterology 85:430,1983). Moreover, the only therapy available for treatment<br>
of HCV infection is interferon-a (INTRON® A, PEG-INTRON®A, Schering-Plough;<br>
ROFERON-A®, PEGASys, Roche). Most patients are unresponsive, however, and<br>
among the responders, there is a high recurrence rate within 6-12 months after<br>
cessation of treatment (Liang et al, J. Med. Tirol. 40:69,1993). Ribavirin, a<br>
guanosine analog with broad spectrum activity against many RNA and DNA viruses,<br>
has been shown in clinical trials to be effective against chronic HCV infection when<br>
used in combination with interferon-a (see, e.g., Poynard et al, Lancet 352:1426-<br>
1432,1998; Reichard et al., Lancet 351:83-87,1998), and this combination therapy<br>
has been recently approved (REBETRON, Schering-Plough; see also Fried et al.,<br>
2002, N. Engl. J. Med. 347:975-982). However, the response rate is still at or below<br>
50%. Therefore, additional compounds for treatment and prevention of HCV infection<br>
are needed.<br>
4. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides substituted diphenyl heterocycles<br>
that are potent inhibitors of Hepatitis C virus ("HCV") replication and/or proliferation.<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds are substituted diphenyl isoxazole, pyrazole<br>
and/or oxadiazole compounds according to structural formula (I):<br>
where Z is CH (isoxazoles, or pyrazoles) or N (oxadiazoles) and X and Y are each,<br>
independently of one another, O and N, provided that: (i) X and Y are not bom O and<br>
(ii) when X and Y are each N, then Z is CH. The "A" phenyl ring includes at least<br>
one, and in many instances two, substituents positioned ortho to the point of<br>
attachment (R2 and/or R6) and optionally from 1 to 4 additional substituents, which<br>
may be the same or different Although the "A" ring may include a single ortho (R2 or<br>
R6) substituent, compounds which include two ortho substituents (R2 and R6) are<br>
particularly active and useful. It is preferable that at least one of the substituent groups<br>
at positions R2 and/or R6 provide some steric bulk. For example, it is preferable that<br>
the R2 and/or R6 substituent be larger than a fluoro group.<br>
The nature of the R2 and/or R6 substituents, as well as the optional substituents<br>
at positions R3, R4 and R5, can vary widely. As a consequence, the "A" phenyl ring<br>
may be substituted with virtually any substituent groups, provided that at least one of<br>
R2 or R6 is other than hydrogen. When the "A" phenyl ring includes more than one<br>
substituent, the substituents may be the same or different. Typical substituent groups<br>
useful for substituting the "A" ring include, but are not limited to, branched, straight-<br>
chain or cyclic alkyls, mono- or polycyclic aryls, branched, straight-chain or cyclic<br>
heteroalkyls, mono- or polycyclic heteroaryls, halos, branched, straight-chain or cyclic<br>
haloalkyls, hydroxyls, oxos, thioxos, branched, straight-chain or cyclic alkoxys,<br>
branched, straight-chain or cyclic haloalkoxys, trifluoromethoxys, mono- or polycyclic<br>
aryloxys, mono- or polycyclic heteroaryloxys, ethers, alcohols, sulfides, tbioethers,<br>
sulfanyls (thiols), imines, azos, azides, amines (primary, secondary and tertiary),<br>
nitriles (any isomer), cyanates (any isomer), thiocyanates (any isomer), nitrosos,<br>
nitros, diazos, sulfoxides, sulfonyls, sulfonic acids, sulfamides, sulfonamides, sulfamic<br>
esters, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, amidines, formadines,<br>
amino acids, acetylenes, carbamates, lactones, lactams, glucosides, gluconurides,<br>
sulfones, ketals, acetals, thioketals, oximes, oxamic acids, oxamic esters, etc., and<br>
combinations of these groups.<br>
These substituent groups may be further substituted at one or more available<br>
carbon or heteroatoms with the same or different additional substituents, which may be<br>
selected from the substituents described above. Any reactive functionalities in the<br>
groups used to substituted the "A" phenyl ring may be masked with a protecting group<br>
or a progroup, as is well-known in the art.<br>
The substituent groups may be attached directly to the phenyl ring, or they may<br>
be spaced away from the ring by way of a linker. The nature of the linker can vary<br>
widely, and can include virtually any combination of atoms or groups useful for<br>
spacing one molecular moiety from another. For example, the linker may be an<br>
acyclic hydrocarbon bridge (e.g, a saturated or unsaturated alkyleno such as methano,<br>
ethano, etheno, propano, prop[l]eno, butano, but[l]eno, but[2]eno, buta[13]dieno, and<br>
the like), a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon bridge (e.g., [l,2]benzeno,<br>
[2,3]naphthaleno, and the like), a simple acyclic heteroatomic or heteroalkyldiyl<br>
bridge (e.g., -O-, -S-, -S-O-, -NH-, -PH-, -C(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, -<br>
S(O)NH-, -S(O)2NH-, -O-CH2-, -CH2-O-CH2-, -O-CH=CH-CH2-, and the like), a<br>
monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaryl bridge (e.g., [3,4]furano, pyridino, thiopheno,<br>
piperidino, piperazino, pyrizidino, pyrrolidino, and the like) or combinations of such<br>
bridges. In one embodiment, the "A" ring is substituted at both R2 and R6 with the<br>
same or different halo, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, methoxy,<br>
haloalkyl, trifluoromethyl, 5-6 membered cycloheteroalkyl or substituted 5-6<br>
membered cycloheteroalkyl group.<br>
The "C" ring is substituted at the meta position with a group of the formula<br>
-NR11 C(O)R12, where R1' is hydrogen or lower alkyl and R12 is monohalomethyl or<br>
dihalomethyl. The "C" ring may optionally include from 1 to 4 additional substituents<br>
(R8, R9, R10 and/or R13), which may be the same or different As for the "A" phenyl<br>
ring, the nature of the optional R8, R9, R10 and R13 substituents can vary broadly.<br>
Groups useful for substituting the "C" phenyl ring are the same as those described for<br>
the "A" phenyl ring, supra. In one embodiment, the "C" ring does not include<br>
optional substituents, such that R8, R9, R10 and R13 are each hydrogen.<br>
As will be recognized by skilled artisans, the actual electron distribution or<br>
double bonding pattern of the "B" ring will depend upon the identities of substituents<br>
X and Y. As illustrated, structural formula (I) is specifically intended to include at<br>
least the following six structures:<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides starting and intermediate compounds<br>
useful for synthesizing the compounds of the invention. Representative starting and<br>
intermediate compounds useful for synthesizing isoxazole and pyrazole compounds of<br>
the invention include compounds 201,203,205,207,209, 223,225,227,229,231,<br>
245, 247,248a, 248b, 249,257 and 259 as depicted in FIGS. 1-7. Representative<br>
starting and intermediate compounds useful for synthesizing oxadiazole compounds of<br>
the invention include compounds 265,267,269,271,285,287 and 289 as depicted in<br>
FIGS. 1-7.<br>
In one embodiment, the intermediates are compounds according to structural<br>
formula (II):<br>
wherein R15 is NO2 or NHR, where R is hydrogen, lower alkyl or a protecting group<br>
and X, Y, Z, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R8, R9, R10 and R13 are as previously defined for<br>
structural formula (I) and subject to the same provisos. Like the compounds of<br>
structural formula (I), in the compounds of structural formula (II) the double bonding<br>
pattern will depend upon the identities of substituents X and Y.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides methods of making the substituted<br>
diphcnyl heterocycle compounds of structural formula (I) or (II). Specific exemplary<br>
embodiments of the methods are illustrated in FIGS. 1-7. In one embodiment, the<br>
method for synthesizing compounds according to structural formula (I) comprises<br>
optionally alkylating a compound according to structural formula (II) in which R15 is<br>
NHR with an alkylating agent (e.g., R11-halide) followed by optional deprotection and<br>
acylation with an acylating agent of the formula LG-C(O)-R12, where "LG" represents<br>
a leaving group or an activating group and R12 is as previously defined in connection<br>
with the compounds of formula (I).<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides compositions comprising the<br>
compounds of the invention. The compositions generally comprise a substituted<br>
diphenyl isoxazole, pyrazole or oxadiazole of the invention, or a salt, hydrate, solvate,<br>
N-oxide or prodrug thereof and a suitable excipient, carrier or diluent. The<br>
composition may be formulated for veterinary uses or for use in humans.<br>
The compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of HCV replication<br>
and/or proliferation. Accordingly, in still another aspect, the present invention<br>
provides methods of inhibiting HCV replication and/or proliferation, comprising<br>
contacting a Hepatitis C virion with an amount of a compound or composition of the<br>
invention effective to inhibit its replication or proliferation. The methods may be<br>
practiced either in vitro or in vivo, and may be used as a therapeutic approach towards<br>
the treatment and/or prevention of HCV infections.<br>
In a final aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating and/or<br>
preventing HCV infections. The methods generally involve administering to a subject<br>
that has an HCV infection or that is at risk of developing an HCV infection an amount<br>
of a compound or composition of the invention effective to treat or prevent the HCV<br>
infection. The method may be practiced in animals in veterinary contexts or in<br>
humans.<br>

Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY<br>
and Harrison et al., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8,1971-1996,<br>

"Prodrug" refers to a derivative of an active compound (drug) that undergoes a<br>
transformation under the conditions of use, such as within the body, to release an<br>
active drug. Prodrugs are frequently, but not necessarily, pharmacologically inactive<br>
until converted into the active drug. Prodrugs are typically obtained by masking a<br>
functional group in the drug believed to be in part required for activity with a progroup<br>
(defined below) to form a promoiety which undergoes a transformation, such as<br>
cleavage, under the specified conditions of use to release the functional group, and<br>
hence the active drug. The cleavage of the promoiety may proceed spontaneously,<br>
such as by way of a hydrolysis reaction, or it may be catalyzed or induced by another<br>
agent, such as by an enzyme, by light, by acid, or by a change of or exposure to a<br>
physical or environmental parameter, such as a change of temperature. The agent may<br>
be endogenous to the conditions of use, such as an enzyme present in the cells to<br>
which the prodrug is administered or the acidic conditions of the stomach, or it may be<br>
supplied exogenously.<br>
A wide variety of progroups, as well as the resultant promoieties, suitable for<br>
masking functional groups in active compounds to yield prodrugs are well-known in<br>
the art For example, a hydroxyl functional group may be masked as a sulfonate, ester<br>
or carbonate promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vitro to provide the hydroxyl<br>
group. An amino functional group may be masked as an amide, inline, phosphinyl,<br>
phosphonyl, phosphoryl or sulfenyl promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to<br>
provide the amino group. A carboxyl group may be masked as- an ester (including<br>
silyl esters and thioesters), amide or hydrazide promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in<br>
vivo to provide the carboxyl group. Other specific examples of suitable progroups and<br>
their respective promoieties will be apparent to those of skill in the art<br>
"Proeroup" refers to a type of protecting group that, when used to mask a<br>
functional group within an active drug to form a promoiety, converts the drug into a<br>
prodrug. Progroups are typically attached to the functional group of the drug via<br>
bonds that are cleavable under specified conditions of use. Thus, a progroup is that<br>
portion of a promoiety that cleaves to release the functional group under the specified<br>
conditions of use. As a specific example, an amide promoiety of the formula<br>
-NH-C(O)CH3 comprises the progroup -C(O)CH3.<br>

6.3 Methods of Synthesis<br>
The compounds of the invention may be obtained via synthetic methods<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 1-7. It should be understood that in FIGS. 1-7, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6,<br>
R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12 and R13 are as previously defined for structural formula (I).<br>
Starting materials useful for preparing compounds of the invention and<br>
intermediates thereof are commercially available or can be prepared by well-known<br>
synthetic methods (see, e.g., Harrison et ah, "Compendium of Synthetic Organic<br>
Methods", Vols. 1-8 (John Wiley and Sons, 1971-1996); "Beilstein Handbook of<br>
Organic Chemistry," Beilstein Institute of Organic Chemistry, Frankfurt, Germany;<br>
Feiser et al, "Reagents for Organic Synthesis," Volumes 1-21, Wiley mterscience;<br>
Trost et al, "Comprehensive Organic Synthesis," Pergamon Press, 1991;<br>
Theilheimer's Synthetic Methods of Organic Chemistry," Volumes 1-45, Karger,<br>
1991; March, "Advanced Organic Chemistry," Wiley wterscience, 1991; Larock<br>
"Comprehensive Organic Transformations," VCH Publishers, 1989; Paquette,<br>
"Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis," 3d Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
1995). Other methods for synthesis of the compounds described herein and/or starting<br>
materials are either described in the art or will be readily apparent to the skilled<br>
artisan. Alternatives to the reagents and/or protecting groups illustrated in FIGS. 1-7<br>
may be found in the references provided above and in other compendiums well known<br>
to the skilled artisan. Guidance for selecting suitable protecting groups can be found,<br>
for example, in Greene &amp; Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis," Wiley<br>
Intcrscience, 1999. Accordingly, the synthetic methods and strategy presented herein<br>
are illustrative rather than comprehensive.<br>
One method for synthesizing substituted diphenyl isoxazoles according to<br>
structural formula (I) (when Z is -CH-) is provided in FIG. 1 A. Referring to FIG. 1 A,<br>
aldol condensation of methyl ketone 201 with benzaldehyde 203 under basic<br>
conditions, followed by in situ dehydration, provides ct-p unsaturated enone 205,<br>
which may be readily converted to isoxazole 207 by treatment with hydroxylamine.<br>
Reduction of 207 yields the amino isoxazole 209, which may be optionally alkylated<br>
with R11-halide and acylated with LG-C(O)-R12 yield 211. In FIG. 1A and throughout<br>
the remaining FIGS. 2-7, "LG" represents a leaving or activating group, regardless of<br>
the moiety to which it is attached. Myriad suitable leaving and activating groups are<br>
known to those of skill in the art. Specific examples useful in the various methods<br>
described herein include, but are not limited to, halo, cyano, acyloxy and the myriad<br>
other leaving groups known to those of skill in the art to be useful in the formation of<br>
amide bonds.<br>
A specific example of the synthetic method of FIG. 1A is illustrated for the<br>
preparation of diphenyl isoxazole 9 in FIG. IB.<br>
Another method for synthesizing substituted isoxazoles of structural formula<br>
(I) (when Z is -CH-) is provided in FIG. 2A. Claisen condensation of methyl ketone<br>
201 with ester 223 under basic conditions provides 1,3 diketone' 229, which may be<br>
converted to a mixture of isoxazoles 207 and 231 by treatment with hydroxylamine.<br>
Isolation and subsequent reduction of 207 yields the amino isoxazole 209, which may<br>
be transformed to the isoxazole 211 as previously described or by other well known<br>
synthetic methods. It should be noted that isoxazole 231 may be isolated and<br>
converted to the corresponding regioisomer of isoxazole 211 (compound 212) by the<br>
same synthetic pathway. A specific example of the synthetic method of FIG. 2A is<br>
illustrated for the preparation of diphenyl isoxazole 9 and its corresponding<br>
regioisomers 5 in FIG. 2B.<br>
In alternative embodiment of the pathway illustrated in FIG. 2A, ester 225 is<br>
condensed with methyl ketone 227 to provide 1,3 diketone 229, which is then carried<br>
through the remainder of the synthetic pathway as previously described.<br>
Still another method for synthesizing substituted isoxazoles of structural<br>
formula (I) (when Z is -CH-) is provided in FIG. 3 A. Nucleophilic addition of<br>
hydroxylamine to benzaldehyde 245 provides an intermediate oxime, which may be<br>
converted by treatment with N-chlorosoccinimide (NCS) or other methods known in<br>
the art to the a-chlorooxime 247. Dehydrohalogenation of a-chlorooxime 247 in the<br>
presence of a base yields nitrile oxide 248a or 248b, which undergoes 1,3 dipolar<br>
cycloaddition in the presence of acetylene 249 to provide the desired isoxazole 211.<br>
As will be recognized by skilled artisans, the nitrile oxide 248a or 248b can be<br>
isolated prior to cycloaddition with acetylene 249 or, alternatively, acetylene 249 may<br>
be added directly to the reaction mixture without first isolating the nitrile oxide 248a<br>
or 248b. Acetylene 249 may be readily prepared from commercially available<br>
precursors by well known synthetic methods. Specific methods are provided in FIG.<br>
7A and 7B. A specific example of the synthetic method of FIG. 3A is illustrated for<br>
the preparation of diphenyl isoxazole 9 in FIG. 3B.<br>
Methods for preparing nitrile oxide 248a or 248b are illustrated in FIG. 3C.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3C, myriad different types of benzylic compounds 303 are converted<br>
to the benzylic nitro compound 305 using standard techniques. Treatment with phcnyl<br>
isocyanate in the presence of a weak base yields nitrile oxide 248a or 248b. 1,3-<br>
Dipolar cycloaddition with acetylene 309 yields isoxazole 311. In acetylene 309 and<br>
isoxazole 311, R15 is -NO2, -NHR or-NR11C(O)R12, where R is hydrogen, lower alkyl<br>
or a protecting group and R11 and R12 are as previously defined for structural formula<br>
(I). Depending upon the identity of R15, isoxazole 311 is then converted to isoxazole<br>
211 using the previously described methods.<br>
Still another method for synthesizing substituted isoxazoles of structural<br>
formula (I) (when Z is -CH-) is provided in FIG. 4A. Nucleophilic addition of<br>
hydroxylamine to benzaldehyde 245 provides an intermediate oxime, which may be<br>
directly converted to nitrile oxide 248a or 248b with NaOCl in the presence of NaOH.<br>
1,3 Dipolar cycloaddition of nitrile oxide 248a or 248b to methyl ketone 259 provides<br>
desired isoxazole 211. Methyl ketone 259 may be readily prepared from commercially<br>
available precursors by well known synthetic methods. A specific example of the<br>
synthetic method of Figure 4A is illustrated for the preparation of diphenyl isoxazole 9<br>
in FIG. 4B.<br>
The methods described in FIGS. 1-4 above may be readily adapted for the<br>
synthesis of pyrazoles by substituting hydrazine for hydroxylamine in the reaction<br>
nn<br>
sequence. Further, those of skill in the art will appreciate that isoxazole regioisomers<br>
of those depicted in the above FIGS. 1-4 may be synthesized by merely interchanging<br>
the reactive functionalities of the two different aromatic rings. An example of this<br>
approach is depicted in FIG. 4C for "reverse" isoxazole 5. As can be seen in FIG. 4C,<br>
interchanging the chlorooxime and alkyne functionalities of the two different aromatic<br>
rings (i.e., rings A and C) provides the regioisomeric isoxazole 5 (compare 253 and<br>
255 with 254 and 256). Further, certain synthetic schemes may provide both isoxazole<br>
regioisomers (e.g., FIG. 2A and 2B) directly, which may be isolated from one another<br>
using standard techniques.<br>
One method for synthesizing substituted oxadiazoles of structural formula (1)<br>
(when Z is -N-) is provided in FIG. 5A. Referring to FIG. 5A, nucleophilic addition of<br>
hydroxylamine to phenyl cyanide 265 yields the amide oxime 267, which may be<br>
condensed with compound 269 to provide oxadiazole 271 after dehydrative cyclization<br>
and reduction. Amino oxadiazole 271 may be optionally alkylated followed by<br>
acylation, as described above, to yield oxadiazole 273. A specific example of the<br>
synthetic method of FIG. 5A is illustrated for the preparation of diphenyl oxadiazole<br>
25 in FIG. 5B.<br>
Another method for synthesizing substituted oxadiazoles of structural formula<br>
(I) (when Z is -N-), which are regioisomers of those prepared above, is provided in<br>
FIG. 6A. Referring to FIG. 6A, amide oxime 287, (prepared by condensation of<br>
hydroxyl amine with a phenyl cyanide), may be condensed with acylating agent 285,<br>
which may be an acyl chloride, to provide oxadiazole 289 after dehydrative cyclization<br>
and reduction. Amino oxadiazole 289 may be transformed by the previously described<br>
methods to final product 291. A specific example of the synthetic method of FIG. 6A<br>
is illustrated for the preparation of diphenyl oxadiazole 87 in FIG. 6B.<br>
FIGS. 7A and 7B, which describe the preparation of acetylene compounds, are<br>
discussed in the Examples section.<br>
In FIGS. 1-7, substituents R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R8, R9, R10 and R13 may include<br>
reactive functional groups that require protection during synthesis. Selection of<br>
suitable protecting groups will depend on the identity of the functional group and the<br>
synthesis method employed, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Guidance<br>
for selecting suitable protecting groups can be found in Greene &amp; Wuts, supra, and the<br>
various other references cited therein.<br>

6.4 Assays For Modulation Of HCV<br>
The compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of HCV<br>
replication and/or proliferation. The activity of the compounds of the invention can be<br>
confirmed in in vitro assays suitable for measuring inhibition of viral or retro viral<br>
replication and/or proliferation. The assays may investigate any parameter that is<br>
directly or indirectly under the influence of HCV, including, but not limited to,<br>
protein-RNA binding, translation, transcription, genome replication, protein<br>
processing, viral particle formation, infectivity, viral transduction, etc. Such assays<br>
are well-known in the art. Regardless of the parameter being investigated, in one<br>
embodiment, to examine the extent of inhibition, samples, cells, tissues, etc.<br>
comprising an HCV replicon or HCV RNA are treated with a potential inhibitory<br>
compound (test compound) and the value for the parameter compared to control cells<br>
(untreated or treated with a vehicle or other placebo). Control samples are assigned a<br>
relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value of the<br>
test compound relative to the control is about 90%, preferably 50%, and more<br>
preferably 25-0%.<br>
Alternatively, the extent of inhibition may be determined based upon the ICso<br>
of the compound in the particular assay, as will be described in more detail, below.<br>
In one embodiment, the inhibitory activity of the compounds can be confirmed<br>
in a replicon assay that assesses the ability of a test compound to block or inhibit HCV<br>
replication in replicon cells. One example of a suitable replicon assay is the liver cell-<br>
line Huh 7-based replicon assay described in Lohmann et al., 1999, Science 285:110-<br>
113. A specific example of this replicon assay which utilizes luciferase translation is<br>
provided in the Examples Section. In one embodiment of this assay, the amount of<br>
test compound mat yields a 50% reduction in translation as compared to a control cell<br>
(ICso) may be determined.<br>
Alternatively, the inhibitory activity of the compounds can be confirmed using<br>
a quantitative Western immunoblot assay utilizing antibodies specific for HCV non-<br>
structural proteins, such as NS3, NS4A NS5A and NS5B. La one embodiment of this<br>
assay, replicon cells are treated with varying concentrations of test compound to<br>
determine the concentration of test compound that yields a 50% reduction in the<br>
amount of a non-structural protein produced as compared to a control sample (ICjo)-<br>
A single non-structural protein may be quantified or multiple non-structural proteins<br>
may be quantified. Antibodies suitable for carrying out such immunoblot assays are<br>
available commercially (e.g., from BIODESIGN International, Saco, ME).<br>
Alternatively, the inhibitory activity of the compounds may be confirmed in an<br>
HCV infection assay, such as the HCV infection assay described in Fournier et al.,<br>
1998, J. Gen. Virol. 79(10):2367:2374, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. In one embodiment of this assay, the amount of test compound mat<br>
yields a 50% reduction in HCV replication or proliferation as compared to a control<br>
cell (IC50) may be determined. The extent of HCV replication may be determined by<br>
quantifying the amount of HCV RNA present in HCV infected cells. A specific<br>
method for carrying out such an assay is provided in the Examples section.<br>
As yet another example, the inhibitory activity of the compounds can be<br>
confirmed using an assay that quantifies the amount of HCV RNA transcribed in<br>
treated replicon cells using, for example, a Taqman assay (Roche Molecular, Alameda,<br>
CA). In one embodiment of this assay, the amount of test compound that yields a 50%<br>
reduction in transcription of one or more HCV RNAs as compared to a control sample<br>
(IC30) may be determined.<br>
Regardless of the assay used, active compounds are generally those which<br>
exhibit IC50s in the particular assay in the range of about 1 mM or less. Compounds<br>
which exhibit lower IC50S, for example, in the range of about 100µM, 10 µM, 1 µM,<br>
100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower, are particularly useful for as therapeutics or<br>
prophylactics to treat or prevent HCV infections.<br>
6.5 Uses and Administration<br>
Owing to their ability to inhibit HCV replication, the compounds of the<br>
invention and/or compositions thereof can be used in a variety of contexts. For<br>
example, the compounds of the invention can be used as controls in in vitro assays to<br>
identify additional more or less potent anti HCV compounds. As another example, the<br>
compounds of the invention and/or compositions thereof can be used as preservatives<br>
or disinfectants in clinical settings to prevent medical instruments and supplies from<br>
becoming infected with HCV virus. When used in this context, the compound of the<br>
invention and/or composition thereof may be applied to the instrument to be<br>
disinfected at a concentration that is a multiple, for example IX, 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or<br>
even higher, of the measured IC50 for the compound<br>
In a specific embodiment, the compounds and/or compositions can be used to<br>
"disinfect" organs for transplantation. For example, a liver or portion thereof being<br>
prepared for transplantation can be perfused with a solution comprising an inhibitory<br>
compound of the invention prior to implanting the organ into the recipient This<br>
method has proven successful with lamuvidine (3TC, Epivir®, Epivir-HB®) for<br>
reducing the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection following liver transplant<br>
surgery/therapy. Quite interestingly, it has been found that such pertusion therapy not<br>
only protects a liver recipient free of HBV infection (HBV-) from contracting HBV<br>
from a liver received from an HBV+ donor, but it also protects a liver from an HBV-<br>
donor transplanted into an HBV+ recipient from attack by HBV. The compounds of<br>
the invention may be used in a similar manner prior to organ or liver transplantation.<br>
The compounds of the invention and/or compositions thereof find particular<br>
use in the treatment and/or prevention of HCV infections in animals and humans.<br>
When used in this context, the compounds may be administered per se, but are<br>
typically formulated and administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The exact composition will depend upon, among other things, the method of<br>
administration and will apparent to those of skill in the art. A wide variety of suitable<br>
pharmaceutical compositions are described, for example, in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th ed., 2001).<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions,<br>
such as an effective amount of the active compound suspended in diluents, such as<br>
water, saline or PEG 400; (b) capsules, sachets or tablets, each containing a<br>
predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as liquids, solids, granules or gelatin;<br>
(c) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (d) suitable emulsions. Tablet forms can<br>
include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, calcium phosphates, corn<br>
starch, potato starch, microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, fillers, binders,<br>
diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, dyes,<br>
disintegrating agents, and pharmaceutically compatible carriers. Lozenge forms can<br>
comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, e.g., sucrose, as well as pastilles comprising<br>
the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and<br>
acacia emulsions, gels, and the like containing, in addition to the active ingredient,<br>
carriers known in the art.<br>
The compound of choice, alone or in combination with other suitable<br>
components, can be made into aerosol formulations (i.e., they can be "nebulized") to<br>
be administered via inhalation. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized<br>
acceptable propellents, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the<br>
like.<br>
Suitable formulations for rectal administration include, for example,<br>
suppositories, which consist of the packaged nucleic acid with a suppository base.<br>
Suitable suppository bases include natural or synthetic triglycerides or paraffin<br>
hydrocarbons, In addition, it is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules which<br>
consist of a combination of the compound of choice with a base, including, for<br>
example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, and paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration, such as, for example, by<br>
intraarticular (in the joints), intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal,<br>
and subcutaneous routes, include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection<br>
solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that<br>
render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous<br>
and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers,<br>
thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. In the practice of this invention,<br>
compositions can be administered, for example, by intravenous infusion, orally,<br>
topically, intraperitoneally, intravesically or intrathecally. Parenteral administration,<br>
oral administration, subcutaneous administration and intravenous administration are<br>
the preferred methods of administration. A specific example of a suitable solution<br>
formulation may comprise from about 0.5-100 mg/ml compound and about 1000<br>
mg/ml propylene glycol in water. Another specific example of a suitable solution<br>
formulation may comprise from about 0.5-100 mg/ml compound and from about 800-<br>
1000 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) in water.<br>
A specific example of a suitable suspension formulation may include from<br>
about 0.5-30 mg/ml compound and one or more excipents selected from the group<br>
consisting of: about 200 mg/ml ethanol; about 1000 mg/ml vegetable oil (e.g., com<br>
oil), about 600-1000 mg/ml fruit juice (e.g., grapefruit juice), about 400-800 mg/ml<br>
milk, about 0.1 mg/ml carboxymethylcellulose (or microcrystaUine cellulose), about<br>
0.5 mg/ml benzyl alcohol (or a combination of benzyl alcohol and benzalkonium<br>
chloride) and about 40-50 mM buffer, pH 7 (e.g., phosphate buffer, acetate buffer or<br>
citrate buffer or, alternatively 5% dextrose may be used in place of the buffer) in<br>
water.<br>
A specific example of a suitable liposome suspension formulation may<br>
comprise from about 0.5-30 mg/ml compound, about 100-200 mg/ml lecithin (or other<br>
phospholipid or mixture of phospholipids) and optionally about 5 mg/ml cholesterol in<br>
water. For subcutaneous administration of compound 9, a liposome suspension<br>
formulation including 5 mg/ml compound in water with 100 mg/ml lecithin and 5<br>
mg/ml compound in water with 100 mg/ml lecithin and 5 mg/ml cholesterol provides<br>
good results. This formulation may be used for other compounds of the invention.<br>
The formulations of compounds can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose<br>
sealed containers, such as ampules and vials. Injection solutions and suspensions can<br>
be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously<br>
described.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such<br>
form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of<br>
the active component The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the<br>
package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets,<br>
capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a<br>
capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of<br>
these in packaged form. The composition can, if desired, also contain other<br>
compatible therapeutic agents, discussed in more detail, below.<br>
In therapeutic use for the treatment of HCV infection, the compounds utilized<br>
in the pharmaceutical method of the invention are administered to patients diagnosed<br>
with HCV infection at dosage levels suitable to achieve therapeutic benefit By'<br>
therapeutic benefit is meant that the administration of compound leads to a beneficial<br>
effect in the patient over time. For example, therapeutic benefit is achieved when the<br>
HCV titer or load in the patient is either reduced or stops increasing. Therapeutic<br>
benefit is also achieved if the administration of compound slows or halts altogether the<br>
onset of the organ damage that or other adverse symptoms typically accompany HCV<br>
infections, regardless of the HCV titer or load in the patient.<br>
The compounds of the invention and/or compositions thereof may also be<br>
administered prophylactically in patients who are at risk of developing HCV infection,<br>
or who have been exposed to HCV, to prevent the development of HCV infection. For<br>
example, the compounds of the invention and/or compositions thereof may be<br>
administered to hospital workers accidentally stuck with needles while working with<br>
HCV patients to lower the risk of, or avoid altogether, developing an HCV infection.<br>
Initial dosages suitable for administration to humans may be determined from<br>
in vitro assays or animal models. For example, an initial dosage may be formulated to<br>
achieve a serum concentration that includes the ICso of the particular compound being<br>
administered, as measured in an in vitro assay. Alternatively, an initial dosage for<br>
humans may be based upon dosages found to be effective in animal models of HCV<br>
infectioa Exemplary suitable model systems are described, for example, in<br>
Muchmore, 2001, Immunol. Rev. 183:86-93 and Lanfoid &amp; Bigger, 2002, Virology,<br>
293:1-9, and the referenced cited therein. As one example, the initial dosage may be<br>
in the range of about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 200 mg/kg/day, or about 0.1 mg/kg/day<br>
to about 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 mg/kg/day to about SO mg/kg/day, or about 10<br>
mg/kg/day to about SO mg/kg/day, can also be used. The dosages, however, may be<br>
varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition<br>
being treated, and the compound being employed. The size of the dose also will be<br>
determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that<br>
accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular patient<br>
Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the<br>
practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than<br>
the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small<br>
increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience,<br>
the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if<br>
desired.<br>
6.6 Combination Therapy<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the compounds of the<br>
invention and/or compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with at least<br>
one other therapeutic agent. A compound of the invention and/or composition thereof<br>
and the therapeutic agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. The<br>
compound of the invention and/or a composition thereof may be administered<br>
concurrently with the administration of the other therapeutic agent(s), or it may be<br>
administered prior to or subsequent to administration of the other therapeutic agent(s).<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention and/or compositions<br>
thereof are used in combination therapy with other antiviral agents or other therapies<br>
known to be effective in the treatment or prevention of HCV. As a specific example,<br>
the compounds of the invention and/or compositions thereof may be used in<br>
combination with known antivirals, such as ribavirin (see, e.g., US Patent No.<br>
4,530,901). As another specific example, the compounds of the invention and/or<br>
compositions thereof may also be administered in combination with one or more of the<br>
compounds described in any of the following: U.S. Patent No. 6,143,715; U.S. Patent<br>

6,410,531; U.S. Patent No. 6,420,380; and U.S. Patent No. 6,448,281.<br>
Yet another specific example, the compounds of the invention and/or<br>
compositions thereof may be used in combination with interferons such as<br>
a-interferon, b-interferon and/or ?-interferon. The interferons may be unmodified,<br>
or may be modified with moieties such as polyethylene glycol (pegylated interferons).<br>

The general procedure of R.K. Howe et al, J. Org. Chem.. 1980,45,3916-3918<br>
was followed. 2,6-Dichlorobenzaldoxime (25.1 gm, 0.132 mol) was dissolved in<br>
DMF (1 SO mL). Then N-chlorosuccinimide (approximately 1.5 g) was added. After<br>
several minutes the reaction was heated until the internal temperature reached 50 °C.<br>
Then the remainder of the N-chlorosuccinimide was added in small portions to a total<br>

was complete, the reaction was allowed to stir for 0.5h, then was diluted with 600 mL<br>
of water. The mixture was extracted twice with ether. The combined ether extracts<br>
were washed three times with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was concentrated under vacuum to<br>

3-Ethynylaniline (2.61 g, 22.3 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous<br>
dichloromethane (20 mL) with triethylamine (3.1 mL, 22.3 mmol). The mixture was<br>
cooled in an ice-bath under nitrogen, then a solution of dichloroacetyl chloride (221<br>
mL, 23 mmol) in anhydrous dichloromethane (20 mL) was added dropwise. After the<br>
addition was completed the ice-bam was removed and the mixture was stirred at room<br>

and 2,2-dichloro-N-(3-ethynylphenyl) acetamide (2.5 g, 110 mmol) were dissolved in<br>
anhydrous THF (40 mL) and triethylamine (1.8 mL). The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for In then heated at reflux for 5h to generate the 2,6-dichlorophenyl<br>
nitrile oxide intermediate, which reacted by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with<br>
2,2-dichloro-N-(3-ethynylphenyl) acetamide. The solvent was removed under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed successively with<br>
water and brine. The ethyl acetate solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,<br>
filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was purified by<br>
column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with 8:2 hexanes-efhyl acetate. The<br>
appropriate fractions were combined and men crystallized from hexanes-ethyl acetate<br>
to give 2,2-dichloro-N-[3-[3-(2,6-dchlorophenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]phenyl] acetamide as a<br>
white crystalline solid, 1.80 g (m.p. 167 °C). NMR (300 MHz, CDC13): 8.21 (broad s,<br>

Referring to Fig. 3 A, the aldehyde starting material 245 was dissolved in<br>
pyridine solvent, and 1.0-1.2 equivalents of solid hydroxylamine hydrochloride was<br>
added in one portion and the homogeneous mixture was stirred overnight at room<br>
temperature. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
dissolved in ethyl acetate and this solution was washed with either IN hydrochloric<br>
acid followed by saturated brine, or by saturated brine alone. The ethyl acetate<br>
solution was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure to yield the desired oxime, 247.<br>
METHOD B<br>
By the general procedure of R.K. Howe, et al J. Heterocvclic Chem.. 1982,19,<br>
721-726 the aldehyde starting material 245 and a molar equivalent amount of<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride were dissolved in 30% aqueous methanol and stirred at<br>
10-20 °C for lh. The solution was cooled to 0 °C for lh whereupon the solid oxime<br>
(not illustrated) precipitated. The solid oxime was then isolated by filtration followed<br>
by air-drying.<br>
METHOD C<br>
By the general procedure of R.K. Howe, et al, J. Ore. Chem.. 1980,45,3916-<br>
3918 the aldehyde starting material 245 in 1:1 ethanol-water was treated with 1.1<br>
equivalents of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 2.5 equivalents of aqueous sodium<br>

The reaction mixture was extracted with ether, which was discarded and the aqueous<br>
layer was separated and acidified to pH 6 with concentrated hydrochloric acid with<br>
cooling. The aqueous layer was extracted with ether and the ether layers were<br>
separated. The combined ether layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,<br>
filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the desired solid oximes.<br>
a-Chlorooxime Formation (Step 2 of FIG. 3A; Compound 247)<br>
METHODD<br>
Again referring to FIG. 3A, the general procedure described by R.K. Howe, et<br>
al, J. Ore. Chem.. 1980,45,3916-3918 was followed. The oxime was dissolved in<br>
DMF and 0.1 molar equivalent of N-chlorosuccinimide was added and the mixture<br>
was heated to SO °C to initiate the reaction. The remaining 0.9 molar equivalent of N-<br>
chlorosuccinimidc was added in small portions keeping the reaction temperature under<br>
SO °C. After the addition was completed, the mixture was stirred for 0.5h and men<br>
diluted with water. The mixture was extracted with ether and the combined ether<br>
extracts were washed with water and brine. The ether layer was dried over anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the desired a-<br>
chlorooxime 247.<br>
METHOD E<br>
The general procedure described by R.K. Howe, et al, J. Ore. Chem.. 1980,45,<br>
3916-3918 was followed. The oxime was dissolved in DMF and 0.1 molar equivalent<br>
of N-chlorosuccinimide was added and the mixture was heated to 50 °C to initiate the<br>
reaction. The remaining 0.9 molar equivalent of N-chlorosuccinimide was added in<br>
small portions keeping the reaction temperature under 50 °C. After the addition was<br>
complete the mixture was stirred for 3h at room temperature. The resulting DMF<br>
solution containing the desired a-chlorooxime 247 was used immediately in the next<br>
step.<br>
General Procedures for the Preparation of 2-Halo- or 2,2-Dihalo-N-(3- .<br>
ethynylphenyl) Acetamides (FIG. 7A &amp; 7B)<br>
Method F (FIG. 7A)<br>
Step J. Acetylenic cross-coupling reactions<br>
Referring to FIG. 7A, the appropriately substituted m-<br>
bromonitrobenzene 315 or substituted m-iodonitrobenzene was dissolved in a suitable<br>
solvent such as p-dioxane or THF and then treated with at least five molar equivalents<br>
of a suitable amine base, which could be triethylamine, diethylamme or<br>
diisopropylethylamine. Alternatively, the amine base alone could be used as the<br>
solvent A stream of argon gas was men bubbled through the solution for several<br>
minutes, followed by the addition of dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (II)<br>
(3-4 mole percent), Cul (6-8 mole percent) and finally trimethylsilylacetylene (1.2-1.3<br>
molar equivalents). The reaction mixture was then heated at 50-80 °C until the<br>
reaction was complete, as monitored by TLC or LC-MS. When the more reactive<br>
substituted m-iodonitrobenzenes were used, the acetylenic cross-coupling reaction<br>
could be performed at room temperature. If the reaction appeared sluggish, additional<br>
trimethylsilylacetylene was added. This general procedure is known in the literature<br>
as the Sonogashira coupling (K. Sonogashira et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1975,4467).<br>
The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate and this solution was washed<br>
several times with brine. Alternatively, the crude reaction mixture was filtered over a<br>
pad of Celite, then diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with brine. The organic layer<br>
so obtained was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to<br>
dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography<br>
on silica gel, eluting with mixtures of ethyl acetate and hexanes to give the desired<br>
substituted m-(trimethylsilylethynyl) nitrobenzenes 317.<br>
Step 2. Redaction of the nitro group to amines<br>
The substituted m-(trimethylsilylethynyl) nitrobenzene 317 prepared in<br>
Step 1 was dissolved in a mixture of 10-15 volume percent of concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid in methanol. Then, iron powder (Aldrich Chemical Co.) (5-10<br>
molar equivalents) was added and the mixture was heated at 70-80 °C for 3-4L This<br>
reaction can be highly exothermic when performed on a large scale. After cooling to<br>
room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered over Celite and the filtrate was<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and<br>
then carefully washed with either aqueous sodium hydroxide or aqueous sodium'<br>
bicarbonate solution. The aqueous layer was discarded and the organic layer was<br>
washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to<br>
dryness under reduced pressure. If necessary the crude product could be purified by<br>
column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with mixtures of hexanes and ethyl<br>
acetate to give the desired substituted m-(trimethylsilylethynyl) anilines 319.<br>
Step 3. Removal of the trimethylsilyl group from the acetylenes<br>
The substituted m-(trimethylsilylethynyl) aniline 319 prepared in Step 2<br>
was dissolved in methanol containing 2-5% water. If the solubility of the aniline in<br>
methanol was poor, an appropriate amount of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as a co-<br>
solvent Then anhydrous potassium carbonate (1 molar equivalent) was added and the<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for l-24h until the reaction was complete by<br>
TLC analysis. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the<br>
residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with brine. The organic layer was<br>
dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
The substituted m-aminophenylacetylenes 321 could be purified by column<br>
chromatography on silica gel, eliding with hexanes and ethyl acetate, if necessary.<br>
Step 4. Introduction of the haloacetunide or dihaloacetamide side<br>
chains<br>
The substituted m-aminophenylacetylene 321 prepared in Step 3 was<br>
dissolved in dichloromethane. Triethylamine (1.3 molar equivalents) was added and<br>
the solution was cooled in an ice-bath under nitrogen. Then a solution of acetylating<br>
reagent LG-C(O)-R12 (e.g, haloacetyl chloride or dihaloacetyl chloride; 1.0 molar<br>
equivalent) in dichloromethane was added dropwise. After the addition was complete,<br>
the reaction was allowed to stir 0.5-lh at 0 °C and then allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature. After a total of l-4h reaction time the reaction mixture was diluted with<br>
water. The organic layer was separated and further washed with saturated aqueous<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the<br>
substituted acetamide compound 323.<br>
Alternatively, the substituted m-aminophenylacetylene 321 starting material<br>
was dissolved in dichloromethane and treated successively with l-(3-<br>
ddmethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (1 molar equivalent), a<br>
compound of the formula RI2-C(O)OH (e.g., a halo- or dihaloacetic acid;l molar<br>
equivalent) and finally triethylamine (1 molar equivalent). The reaction mixture was<br>
then stirred at room temperature until the substituted m-aminophenylacetylene starting<br>
material 321 was consumed as determined by TLC analysis. The mixture was washed<br>
with water and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and<br>
concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to give the acetamide 323.<br>
Method G (FIG. 7B)<br>
Referring to FIG. 7B, an appropriately substituted m-iodoaniline or m-<br>
bromoaniline starting material 325 was coupled with trimethylsilyiacetylene as<br>
described in Step 1 of Method F. The resulting substituted m-(trimethybilylethynyl)<br>
aniline 327 was then deprotected using the procedure described in Step 3 of Method F<br>
to give the substituted m-aminophenylacetylene 329 which was then converted to the<br>
desired acetamide 331 as described in Step 4 of Method F.<br>
1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions to make Isoxazoles (FIG. 3A; 247 — 211)<br>
Method H<br>
Referring again to FIG. 3A, the o-chlorooxime 247 and 1.0 molar equivalent of<br>
the appropriate phcnylacctylcne were dissolved in either anhydrous THF or DMF and<br>
1.3 molar equivalents of triethylamine was added. The a-chlorooxime immediately<br>
reacted with triethylamine to produce the corresponding phenyl nitrile oxide<br>
intermediate (248a or 248b) and also produced a precipitate of triethylamine<br>
hydrochloride. The heterogeneous mixture was then heated at 70-80 °C for 3-6h to<br>
induce the 1,3-dipolar Cycloaddition reaction of the phenyl nitrile oxide with the<br>
phenylacetylene 249. The solvent was removed by concentration under reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and this solution was washed with<br>
aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution followed by water and brine. The ethyl acetate<br>
layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure to yield the crude product 211. This material was further purified by<br>
column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexanes-ethyl acetate or by HPLC<br>
chromatography on a C-18 reversed phase column (mobile phase acetonitrile-water-<br>
trifiuoroacetic acid). The isolated isoxazoles 211 were either crystallized or<br>
characterized as solids by spectral analysis.<br>
In the same manner, the compounds listed below were made from the<br>
corresponding a-chlorooximes and the corresponding phenylacetylenes (the structures<br>
of the compounds are provided in TABLE 1).<br>

7.2 Exemplary Compounds of the Invention Inhibit HCV Translation<br>
Or Replication<br>
7.2.1 Replicon Assay<br>
The inhibitory activity of certain exemplary compounds of the<br>
invention was confirmed using an HCV replicon assay. The HCV replicon can<br>
include such features as the HCV 5' untranslated region including the HCV IRES, the<br>
HCV 3' untranslated region, selected HCV genes encoding HCV polypeptides,<br>
selectable markers, and a reporter gene such as luciferase, GFP, etc. In the assay,<br>
actively dividing 5-2 Luc replicon-comprising cells (obtained from Rolf<br>
Bartenschlager, see Lohmann et al., 1999, Science 285:110-113) were seeded at a<br>
density of between about 5,000 and 7,500 cells/well onto 96 well plates (about 90 (il<br>
of cells per well) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Then, the test<br>
compound (in a volume of about 10 µl) was added to the wells at various<br>
concentrations and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours before<br>
luciferase assay. The media was aspirated from each well and Bright-Glo (Promega,<br>
Madison, WI) luciferase assay reagents were added to each well according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Bri0efly, the Bright-Glo reagent was diluted 1:1 with PBS<br>
and 100 µl of diluted reagent was added to each well. After 5 min of incubation at<br>
room temperature, luciferin emission was quantified with a luminometer. In this<br>
assay, the amount of test compound that yielded a 50% reduction in luciferase<br>
emission (IC50) was determined.<br>
7.2.2 Western Blot Assay<br>
Certain exemplary compounds of the invention were also tested<br>
for their ability to inhibit HCV replication using a quantitative Western blot analysis<br>
with antibodies specific for the HCV nonstructural protein NS5A. Actively dividing<br>
9-13 replicon cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 1X105 cells/well in a<br>
volume of 2 ml/well and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Various<br>
concentrations of test compounds (in a volume of 10 ul) were added to the wells and<br>
the cells incubated for another 48 hours. Protein samples were prepared from the<br>
cultured cells, resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose<br>
membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS for 1 hour at<br>
room temperature. Primary antibody (and NSSA antibody; BIODESIGN<br>
International, Saco, ME) incubation was performed for 1 hour at room temperature,<br>
after which the membrane was washed 3 times (for 15 min per time) with PBST (PBS<br>
plus 0.1% Tween 20). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody<br>
incubation was performed for 1 hour at room temperature and the membrane was<br>
washed 3 times (for 15 min per time) with PBST. The membrane was then soaked in<br>
substrate solution (Pierce) and exposed to a film or quantified using an imager. In this<br>
assay, the amount of test compound that yielded a 50% reduction in the amount of<br>
NSSA protein translated as compared to a control sample (IC50) was determined.<br>
The results of the Replicon and Western blot assays are provided in TABLE 1,<br>
below. In TABLE 1, a value of"+" indicates an IC50 of 10 µM or less in the specified<br>
assay; a value of"-" indicates an IC50 of greater than 10 µM in the specified assay.<br>
Many of the compounds exhibited IC50S in the Replicon assay in the nanomolar range.<br>
7.2.3 Luciferase Counter Screen<br>
A counter screen was used to identify non-specific inhibitors of<br>
the luciferase reporter gene. In the counter screen, a cell line carrying a construct such<br>
as a CMV-driven luciferase gene was used to identify compounds that inhibit the<br>
reporter gene, and not HCV. In these CMV-Luc cells, the DNA construct, which<br>
comprises a luciferase gene downstream of a CMV promoter, is permanently<br>
integrated into the chromosome of Huh7 cells. For the counter screen, actively<br>
dividing CMV-Luc cells were seeded at a density of 5000-7500 cells/well in a volume<br>
of 90 µl/well into 96 well plate(s). The cells were then incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2<br>
for 24 hours. Various concentrations of test compounds (in a volume of 10 ul) were<br>
added to the wells and the cells were incubated for another 24 hours. Media was<br>
aspirated from each well and Bright-Glo (Pharmacia) luciferase assay reagents were<br>
added to each well according to the manufacturer's manual. Luciferin counts were<br>
taken using a luminometer. IC50 values were greater than 10 µM in the counter screen<br>
luciferase inhibition assay for the compounds of TABLE 1 that were tested.<br>
7.2.4 PCR Assay<br>
A TaqMan RT-PCR assay (Roche Molecular Systems,<br>
Pleasanton, CA) was used to analyze HCV RNA copy numbers, which confirmed mat<br>
the viral genome of HCV is not being replicated. Actively dividing 9-13 replicon cells<br>
were seeded at a density of 3 x 104 cells/well in a volume of 1 ml/well into 24-well<br>
plates. The cells were then incubated at 37° C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Various<br>
concentrations of test compounds (in a volume of 10 ul) were added to the wells and<br>
the cells were incubated for an additional 24-48 hours. Media was removed by<br>
aspiration and RNA samples prepared from each well. TaqMan one step RT-PCR<br>
(Roche Molecular Systems, Alameda, CA) was performed using the freshly prepared<br>
RNA samples according to the manufacturer's manual and analyzed on an ABI Prism<br>
7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The ratio of HCV RNA to cellular<br>
GAPDH RNA was used as in indication of specificity of HCV inhibition to confirm<br>
that the viral genome was not replicated.<br>
7.2.5 HCV Infection Assay<br>
The activity of Compound 9 was also confirmed in an HCV<br>
infection assay. The assay was carried out essentially as described in Fournier et aL,<br>
1998, J. Gen. Virol. 79:2367-2374. Briefly, hepatocyte cells from a doner were plated<br>
on Day 1. On Day 3, the cells were inoculated with HCV vims and test compound<br>
was added. On Day 5, the medium was changed and test compound was added. On<br>
Day 7, the medium was changed and test compound was added. On Day 8, the RNA<br>
was isolated and the HCV RNA quantified using a Taqman assay. Compound 9<br>
exhibited an IC50 of less than 10 [iM in this assay.<br>
7.3 The Compounds Are Non-Toxic In Cellular and Animal Models<br>
7.3.1 Cytotoxicity<br>
Compounds 67,167,169,13,1, 145, 19,119,63,31,39,103,<br>
123,121,97,129,79, 111, 85,89,109,127,131,95,47,57,69,165,161,163,3,137,<br>
15,141, 41, 53,33,113, 93,105,77,91,81,83, 35,27, 65,7,135,51,139,51,49,<br>
143,5,149,11,37,21,45,61,75,23,125,73,43,171 and 101 were tested in a<br>
cytotoxidty assay with liver cells including an HCV replicon (5-2 Luc cells, 9-13 cells<br>
or Huh-7 cells). In the assay, cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (approx. 7500<br>
cells/well in a volume of 90 µl) and grown for 24 hr at 37°C. On day 2, various<br>
concentrations of test compound (in a volume of 10 µl) were added to the wells and<br>
the cells were grown for an additional 24 hr at 37°C. On day 3, an ATP-dependent R-<br>
Luciferase assay (Cell Titer Glo assay) was performed to determine the number of<br>
viable cells. With the exception of compounds 67,47,69,105,27 and 23, all<br>
compounds tested exhibited an IC50 of greater than 10 µM, confirming that the<br>
compounds are non-toxic. Of the remaining compounds, all but compound 69, which<br>
exhibited an IC50 of 3 µM, had IC50S greater than 5 µM, demonstrating mat these<br>
compounds are well-tolerated, as well.<br>
7.3.2 Animal Stuthes<br>
The safety of compound 9 was evaluated in rats by both<br>
subcutaneous and intravenous administration in several experiments. Doses as high as<br>
30 mg/kg/day were well tolerated. The experiments performed are summarized below.<br>
In a first study the toxicity of compound 9 was evaluated either by the<br>
subcutaneous (SC) route or the intravenous (TV via jugular cannula) route of<br>
administration in Sprague Dawley rats. There were two male rats in each group. A<br>
dose escalation scheme was employed where compound 9 was delivered IV or SC for<br>
3 consecutive days at a dose of 10 mg/kg (study Days 1-3) in a 80%:20% - PEG/water<br>
vehicle; delivered one day IV or SC dose of 30 mg/kg (study Day 4) in 100% PEG;<br>
and an IV dose of 60 mg/kg (study Day 5) in 100% PEG. Compound 9 was well<br>
tolerated at doses up to and including 30 mg/kg by both routes of administration.<br>
However, when the IV dose was increased to 60 mg/kg on Day 5 immediate clinical<br>
signs (collapsing, thrashing, dyspnea and reddish discolored urine) were observed.<br>
The symptoms were transient abating within 1 hour. Toxicokinetic determinations<br>
from the current study and what is known from an earlier experiment demonstrate high<br>
exposure from the IV route and much lower exposure via the subcutaneous route. As<br>
expected by the IV route Cmax is achieved rapidly at about two minutes with a Tl/2<br>
of about 5 minutes with measurable compound 9 still apparent after 2 hours. By the<br>
SC route Tmax is achieved at about 30 minutes and exposure remains sustained<br>
through 2 hours post-dosing.<br>
In a second study compound 9 was administered by the IV route at doses of 10<br>
and 30 mg/kg in 100% PEG. The volume administered for the 10 mg/kg dose was<br>
0.67 ml/kg/day and volume given the 30 mg/kg group was 2 ml/kg/day. In addition,<br>
there were two control groups. One control received 100 % PEG alone at a volume of<br>
2 ml/kg/day while the other was an untreated sham control group. All groups (except<br>
for the untreated control with 3 male rats) had 4 male rats each. Parameters of study<br>
included: clinical observations, body weights, hematology, clinical chemistry, gross<br>
necropsy, organ weights, bone marrow assessment and histopathology of selected<br>
organs. There were very slight decreases in red blood cells, hemoglobin and<br>
hematocrit at 30 mg/kg relative to the untreated control but not the vehicle control.<br>
Otherwise, there were no untoward findings in any other in life parameter, clinical<br>
pathology, bone marrow cytology, gross and/or microscopic morphological changes<br>
attributed to compound 9 observed in the study. A dose of 30 mg/kg was considered<br>
the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) by the IV route of administration<br>
during 7 days.<br>
In a third study compound 9 was compared with two other compounds and<br>
administered at a dose of 10 and 30 mg/kg in 100 % PEG and delivered by IV at a<br>
concentration of 1 ml/kg/day first via a jugular cannula and when the cannula failed by<br>
the lateral tail vein. A vehicle control group received the 100% PEG alone at the same<br>
volume. Groups comprised 3 males and 3 females each. Before reducing the dose to<br>
10 and 30 mg/kg two rats received 100 mg/kg IV at a volume of 1 ml/kg. Both<br>
animals thed within a minute or two of dosing acutely from apparent respiratory<br>
failure. Necropsy revealed only mat a drug precipitate had formed at the terminal end<br>
of the cannula. Death may have been associated with an emboli fonned by<br>
precipitated drug. Parameters of study included: clinical observations, body weights,<br>
hematology, clinical chemistry, gross necropsy, organ weights and bistopathology of<br>
selected organs (including injection sites).<br>
Clinical observations, body weights, hematology and clinical chemistry and<br>
organ weights were unaffected by treatment with compound 9 when compared with<br>
the vehicle control. At necropsy there were no gross or microscopic morphological<br>
changes associated with compound 9. There were, nevertheless, changes/lesions<br>
attributed to the irritancy of the 100% PEG vehicle. These changes included those<br>
associated with the injection site focal to the tissues surrounding or in proximity to the<br>
end of the cannula (several terminal ends of the caimulas were obstructed) and in the<br>
tail and/or changes associated with subacute IV administration of several animals in<br>
both the compound 9 and vehicle control group. The NOAEL for intravenous<br>
administration of compound 9 during 14-days was judged to be 30 mg/kg.<br>
7.4 Sustained Plasma Levels Are Achieved<br>
The pharmacokinetic properties of compound 9 were calculated in rats,<br>
monkeys and chimpanzees using the intravenous and subcutaneous routes of<br>
administration with a variety of different delivery vehicles. Sustained plasma levels<br>
were achieved with several different liposome suspension vehicles using subcutaneous<br>
administration: (i) 5 mg/ml compound 9 in water with 100 mg/ml lecithin; (ii) 5 mg/ml<br>
compound 9 in water with 200 mg/ml lecithin; and (iii) 5 mg/ml compound 9 in water<br>
with 100 mg/ml lecithin and 5 mg/ml cholesterol. Based on these results, it is<br>
expected mat other liposome formulations as are well-known in the art may be used to<br>
administer the compounds of the invention<br>
