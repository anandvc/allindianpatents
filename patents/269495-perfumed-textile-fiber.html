PERFUMED TEXTILE FIBER<br>
ADITYA BIRLA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANY LIMITED<br>
an Indian Company <br>
Aditya Birla Center, S. K. Ahire Marg, Worli, Mumbai 400 025,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to textile fibers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The term "fiber" or "textile fiber" means a unit of matter which is capable of being<br>
spun into a yarn or made into a fabric by bonding or by interlacing in a variety of<br>
methods including weaving, knitting, braiding, felting, twisting, or webbing, and<br>
which is the basic structural element of textile products.<br>
The fibers from natural sources are basically classified into two types: natural<br>
fibers and man made or manufactured fibers.<br>
The term "natural fiber" means any fiber that exists as such in the natural state e.g.<br>
vegetable fibers or wood fibers. Man-made fibers are obtained by treating natural<br>
raw materials with synthetic chemicals. Many types of fiber are manufactured from<br>
natural cellulose, including rayon.<br>
For centuries, mankind has relied upon various plants and animals to provide raw<br>
materials for fabrics and clothing. In recent times, however, the industrialization<br>
and scientific advancement has provided several improved materials having far<br>
superior properties, particularly suitable for clothing.<br>
Rayon is natural cellulosic fiber material obtained from wood pulp or cotton. Some<br>
of the reasons for popularity and success of Rayon in clothing industry include its<br>
low cost, diversity and ability to provide comfort. Rayon is moisture absorbent<br>
(more so than cotton), breathable, comfortable to wear, and easily dyed in vivid<br>
colors. Rayon is soft to the skin and has moderate dry strength and abrasion<br>
resistance. Like other cellulosic fibers, it is not resilient, which means that it will<br>
wrinkle. One of rayon's strengths is its versatility and ability to blend easily with<br>
many fibers.<br>
A wide variety  of rayon materials  are  available.  Viscose  rayon fibers  are<br>
manufactured by preparing strongly alkaline viscose solution of cellulosic pulp by<br>
2<br><br>
xanthation and spinning the cellulose xanthate solution in a sulfuric acid spin bath to regenerate the viscose. Viscose rayon fibers are commonly used in apparel (such as accessories, dresses, jackets, linings, millinery, slacks, sport shirts, sportswear, suits, ties, work clothes), home furnishings (such as bedspreads, blankets, curtains, draperies, sheets, slipcovers, tablecloths, upholstery) and other industrial areas (such as industrial products, medical and surgical products, non woven products, tire cord and the like).<br>
Differences in raw material, processing chemicals, fiber diameter, post treatments and blend ratios can be manipulated to produce a fiber having customized properties suitable for particular application. It is often desired that the rayon fabrics possess typical properties such as thermal stability, ability to retain perfumes, antibacterial properties and the like. These properties are essential in several industrial as well as household applications. There has been a considerable interest in developing such materials.<br>
In United States Patent No. 6,482,514 deodorant rayon fibers are disclosed by implanting white charcoal in their matrix. The fine grains of white charcoal are obtained by milling the white charcoal from irregular configurations with projections. As a result, even after implanting in the rayon matrix, the projections tend to be exposed on the surface of rayon fiber, which adsorb odor gases on themselves. However, such fibers were applicable to specific gases (ammonia, trimethylamine and sulfured hydrogen) only, which are typical offensive odor gases.<br>
Published US Patent Application No. 20060258768 discloses a composition suitable for application on carpets, fabrics and the like for providing a controlled release of an active material into the environment surrounding the surface. The<br>
3<br><br>
active material is perfume, flavonoids and /or odor blockers. The surfaces, especially fabrics are preferably treated by either spraying dilute aqueous composition of the present invention, onto the surface via a spray dispenser or by adding the concentrated composition to a washing or rinsing cycle of laundry process.<br>
The present invention provides rayon fibers containing aromatic active ingredients.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
1.	It is one of the objects of the present invention to provide viscose rayon fibers containing additive.<br>
2.	It is another object of the invention to provide perfumed viscose fibers having enhanced durability in use, especially a resistance to washing and good mechanical properties.<br>
3.	It is a further object of the invention to provide regenerated additive containing rayon fibers which are resistant to heat, moisture, solvents and dry cleaning.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
According to present invention, there is provided regenerated cellulose fibers containing additives, wherein the additives are embedded in pockets along the length of the fibers. The additives remain embedded even after multiple washings or rough use of the fibers.<br>
The additives in accordance with this invention are aromatic compounds, perfumes, fragrances and aromatic oils, which impart a pleasant smell to the fibers and ultimately fabric or garments made from these fibers. The additives are hydrophobic in nature.<br>
4<br><br>
The perfumed rayon fibers according to the present invention are prepared by homogenizing viscose with a micro-emulsion solution containing suitable aromatic active ingredients. Such treated viscose is then extruded or spun into fiber, film or any other desired form. The treatment of viscose with the micro-emulsion solution before spinning or extrusion results in effective adhesion of additive on to the rayon material.<br>
Typically, a mixture of appropriate active ingredient is prepared in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents.<br>
A few non-limiting examples of suitable solvents include C10-C44 alkanes, paraffinic hydrocarbons, polyethylene, polypropylene, polypropylene glycol, polytetramethylene glycol, polypropylene malonate, polyneopentyl glycol sebacate, polypentane glutarate, polyvinyl myristate, polyvinyl stearate, polyvinyl laurate, polyhexadecyl methacrylate, polyoctadecyl methacrylate, polyethylene oxides, polyethylene glycols, polyesters and mixtures thereof.<br>
It is desirable that the active ingredient is soluble in solvent in the range of about 5 to 100%. Further, the active ingredients and other additives should be substantially insoluble in water.<br>
Typically, a mixture of active ingredient in appropriate solvent is prepared and mixed with a suitable surfactant to get a micro-emulsion. Such mixing may be achieved using high speed mixers such as Ultraturrex or a mechanical emulsifier; a colloid mill; a high pressure homogenizer and an ultrasonic emulsifier. The micro-emulsion may contain further additional additives, if desired.<br>
5<br><br>
Typically, the viscose rayon obtained using above process results in the formation of fibers containing pockets of dispersed phase trapped in the viscose matrix. These pockets serve as a reservoir for added active ingredients. The active ingredient is released from the reservoir into the viscose matrix. The structure of reservoir, viscose and surrounding conditions determine the release rate of the active ingredient. For example, release of active ingredient can be triggered by volatilizing the active ingredient from the reservoir upon contact with body temperature. The molecules migrate from the reservoir to the surrounding primarily by diffusion.<br>
Various other textile fibers containing perfume active ingredient can be prepared using the methods disclosed herein. Typical, non-limiting examples of such textile fibers include acrylic fibers, polyester fibers and the like.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the specific steps of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many alterations can be made and that many modifications can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br><br><br><br></td>
