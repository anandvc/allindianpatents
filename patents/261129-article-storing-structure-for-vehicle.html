[Title of the Invention] ARTICLE STORING STRUCTURE FOR VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement in an article storing structure for a vehicle in which a storage is provided to the vehicle body in a manner capable of being opened and closed. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
There is known an article storing structure for a vehicle which includes a storage, and a hinge portion for supporting the storage on the vehicle body in a manner capable of being opened and closed (see, for example. Patent Document 1). [Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2003-191878 (Fig. 11) [0003]<br>
In Fig. 11 of Patent Document 1, a leg shield 17R' on the right side constituting a body cover 15' is provided with a pivot 64 as a component of a hinge portion, a rotating arm 63 rotatably mounted to the pivot 64, and a storage box 56 (hereinafter, referred to as "pocket portion 56") mounted to the rotating arm 63. [0004]<br>
The pocket portion 56 is provided so as to be rotatable about the pivot 64 between a retracted position where the pocket portion 56 is retracted in the leg shield 17R' , and a drawn-out position where the pocket portion 56 is drawn out from the leg shield 17R'.<br><br>
[0005]<br>
In the technique according to Patent Document 1, the pivot 64 is arranged horizontally in the lower portion of the pocket portion 56. In this case, articles can be easily taken out by making the opening angle large. However, when the pocket portion 56 is opened to a large opening angle, stored articles can easily drop from the pocket portion 56. To prevent dropping of stored articles from the pocket portion 56, it is necessary to take such a measure as to add a member for preventing the drop. However, providing such a member may lead to a reduction in the storage capacity of the pocket portion 56. [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0006]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an article storing structure for a vehicle which secures a sufficient storage capacity of the pocket portion, makes it possible to easily take out stored articles stored in the pocket portion, and also enhances the ease of maintenance for the interior of the pocket portion.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0007]<br>
An aspect of the invention according to Claim 1 relates to an article storing structure for a vehicle including a pocket portion as a storage, and a hinge portion for supporting the pocket portion on a vehicle body in a manner capable of being opened and closed, wherein a hinge shaft constituting a rotation center of the hinge portion is arranged so as to extend in a<br><br>
vertical direction. [0008]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 2, the pocket portion includes a bottom portion and a circumferential wall erected on a lateral side of the bottom portion, and has an opening that opens upward. [0009]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 3, the pocket portion is connected to the hinge portion via a hinge arm. [0010]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 4, an exterior cover that constitutes a part of a design surface of a body cover is detachably mounted to the pocket portion. [0011]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 5, the body cover includes a cover member that covers a portion above the exterior cover when the pocket portion is closed, and as seen from above the vehicle body, a rear edge of the cover member has a recess that is recessed toward the front of the vehicle body. [Effect of the Invention] [0012]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 1, since the hinge shaft is arranged so as to extend in the vertical direction, the pocket portion rotates in the horizontal direction about the hinge shaft. Since the pocket portion moves in the horizontal direction and is arranged in a manner capable of being opened and closed, the pocket portion can be opened wide without tilting the pocket portion. Since the pocket portion is opened<br><br>
wide, articles can be easily put into the pocket portion, and articles can be easily taken out from the pocket portion. [0013]<br>
Since there is no need to tilt the pocket portion, there is no fear of stored small articles dropping from the pocket portion when the pocket portion is opened wide. Further, since there is no need to provide an additional member for preventing dropping of stored articles, the storage capacity of the pocket portion is not reduced. [0014]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 2, the pocket portion includes a bottom portion and a circumferential wall erected on a lateral side of the bottom portion. Thus, a sufficient storage capacity can be secured for the pocket portion by increasing the height of the circumferential wall. Since the pocket portion is provided with the circumferential wall, there is no fear of articles stored in the pocket portion from dropping when the pocket portion is opened and closed. [0015]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 3, the pocket portion is connected to the hinge portion via the hinge arm, so the pocket portion can be opened further from an opened position. Since a hand can be inserted into a maintenance hole that opens after the pocket portion is further opened, when an auxiliary part that requires maintenance is arranged in the inner portion of the pocket portion, maintenance can be performed for the auxiliary part while keeping small articles in the pocket portion as they are, without detaching the pocket portion. Since<br><br>
there is no need to detach the pocket portion, the ease of maintenance for a front portion of a vehicle can be enhanced. [0016]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 4, an exterior cover is detachably mounted to the pocket portion, so it is possible to design the pocket portion without consideration of the shape, outward appearance, and the like of the exterior cover. That is, the degree of freedom in setting the shape of the pocket portion can be enhanced. If the degree of freedom in setting the shape of the pocket portion is enhanced, it is also possible to secure a large capacity of the pocket portion as compared with a case where the exterior cover is integrated with the pocket portion. [0017]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 5, a rear edge of the cover member has a recess that is recessed toward the front of the vehicle body. Thus, as compared with a case where the recess is not provided, upon opening the pocket portion, the area of the opening provided in the pocket portion can be made large even at a small opening angle of the pocket portion.<br>
Since the opening area of the pocket portion can be made large, the ease of operation when storing articles into the pocket portion and when taking out articles from the pocket portion can be enhanced.<br>

Fig. 2 is a plan view illustrating the article storing structure according to the present invention, and Fig. 3 is a view as seen from the arrow 3 of Fig. 2.<br>
In the following, a description will be given while referring to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. In the drawings, the body frame and other elements are omitted for the ease of understanding.<br>
The front meter panel 54 having a handlebar hole 72 through which the steering shaft (reference numeral 34 in Fig. 1) passes is provided at the front portion of the motorcycle 10. The leg shield 56 that covers the occupant's feet is arranged at a rear edge 54b of the front meter panel 54.<br>
An article storing structure 73 according to the present invention is provided at the front portion of the motorcycle 10. The article storing structure 73 includes the pocket portion 61 provided in an upper portion of the leg shield 56 which constitutes the vehicle body, and a hinge portion 74 that supports the pocket portion 61 in a manner capable of being opened and closed. [0029]<br>
In this embodiment, the pocket portion 61 is arranged on the left side in the vehicle width direction, and the hinge portion 74 is similarly arranged also on the left side. It should be noted that the pocket portion 61 and the hinge portion 74 may be arranged on the right side in the vehicle width direction. [0030]<br>
The pocket portion 61 is a member having an opening 76 at the top, and includes a bottom portion 77 and a circumferential wall 78 erected on four sides from the bottom portion 77. The<br><br>
exterior cover 55, which extends smoothly continuous to the outer surface of the leg shield 56 to constitute a design surface and has a holding portion 94 described later, is mounted to the pocket portion 61. Reference numeral 80 denotes a right lid member that closes a hole formed in the leg shield 56. [0031]<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken along the line 4-4 of Fig. 2. In the following, a description will be given by also referring to Fig. 2.<br>
In Fig. 4(a), a support stay 81 that supports the pocket portion 61 at the front of the vehicle body projects from the leg shield 56. A through hole 82 is formed vertically in the support stay 81. In the through hole 82, there is arranged a hinge shaft 83 that constitutes the rotation center of the hinge portion 74 so as to extend in the vertical direction of the vehicle body. A hinge arm 84 formed in a U shape in cross section is rotatably attached to the support stay 81 via the hinge shaft 83. A distal end portion 84a of the hinge arm 84 is connected to the pocket portion 61 via a bolt 89. In the drawings, reference numeral 83p denotes a detachment prevention member that prevents detachment of the hinge shaft 83. That is, the pocket portion 61 is mounted to the hinge portion 74 via the hinge arm 84,<br>
Fig. 4(b) is a view as seen from the arrow b of Fig. 4(a), illustrating the detachment prevention member 83p that prevents the hinge shaft 83 from detaching from the support stay 81 and the hinge arm 84. [0032]<br>
Fig. 5 is a view illustrating the article storing structure<br><br>
according to the present invention and its operation (from when the pocket portion is closed to when the pocket portion is opened).<br>
In Fig. 5(a), the body cover 45 includes the front meter panel 54 serving as the cover member 53 that covers a portion above the exterior cover 55 when the pocket portion 61 is closed. The rear edge 54b of the front meter panel 54 has a recess 85 that is recessed by a length L toward the front of the vehicle body so as to extend outward in the width direction of the vehicle body from the center of the vehicle body.<br>
As compared with a case where the recess 85 is not provided, the opening area of the opening 7 6 upon drawing out the pocket portion 61 becomes larger at the same opening angle, thereby making it easier to take articles in and out of the pocket portion 61. [0033]<br>
In Fig. 5(b), since the hinge shaft 83 is arranged so as to extend in the vertical direction, the pocket portion 61 can be opened wide without tilting the pocket portion 61.  Since the pocket portion 61 can be opened wide, putting of articles into the pocket portion 61 and taking of articles from the pocket portion 61 are facilitated. Since there is no need to tilt the pocket portion 61, there is no fear of stored small articles (stored articles) dropping from the pocket portion 61 when the pocket portion 61 is opened wide. Further, since there is no need to provide an additional member for preventing dropping of stored articles, there is no fear of the storage capacity of the pocket portion 61 being reduced.<br><br>
[0034]<br>
Since the pocket portion 61 includes the bottom portion 77, and the circumferential wall 78 erected from the bottom portion<br>
77,	a sufficient storage capacity can be secured for the pocket<br>
portion 61 by increasing the height of the circumferential wall<br>
78.	In addition, this prevents articles stored in the pocket<br>
portion 61 from dropping when the pocket portion 61 is opened and<br>
closed.<br>
[0035]<br>
Further, in the pocket portion 61, a pocket-portion supporting portion 102 for dispersing the load exerted on the pocket portion 61 is attached in the horizontal direction and in the opening and closing direction of the pocket portion 61.<br>
Supposing that the pocket-portion supporting portion 102 is not attached, if a heavy article is accommodated in the pocket portion 61 when the pocket portion 61 is drawn out from the leg shield 56, the load of the heavy article must be supported by the hinge portion 74. [0036]<br>
In this regard, according to the present invention, by attaching the pocket-portion supporting portion 102, the pocket portion 61 is supported via the pocket-portion supporting portion 102 by a flat surface 103 included in the leg shield 56. Since the pocket portion 61 is supported by the pocket-portion supporting portion 102 together with the hinge portion 74, it is possible to disperse the load exerted on the pocket portion 61, thereby enhancing the supporting strength of the pocket portion 61.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
Fig. 6 is a view illustrating the operation of the article storing structure according to the present invention (when the pocket portion is fully opened). Since the pocket portion 61 is connected to the hinge portion 74 via the hinge arm 84, it is possible to further open the pocket portion 61 from an opened position.<br>
[0038]<br>
A hand can be inserted into a maintenance hole 86 that opens after the pocket portion 61 is further opened. Thus, when an auxiliary part 87 that requires maintenance is arranged in the inner portion of the pocket portion 61, maintenance can be easily performed for the auxiliary part 87, for example, a headlight bulb 88 while keeping small articles in the pocket portion 61 as they are, without detaching the pocket portion 61. Since there is no need to detach the pocket portion 61, the ease of maintenance can be enhanced.<br>
It should be noted that examples of auxiliary part include electrical parts such as a fuse and a relay.<br>
[0039]<br>
The rear edge 53b of the cover member 53 has the recess 83 that is recessed toward the front of the vehicle body. Thus, as compared with a case where the recess 85 is not provided, upon opening the pocket portion 61, the area of the opening 76 provided in the pocket portion 61 can be made large at the same opening angle of the pocket portion 61. Since the opening area of the pocket portion 61 can be made large, the ease of unloading or storage of articles from or into the pocket portion 61 can be<br><br>
enhanced. [0040]<br>
Fig. 7 is a view as seen from the arrow 7 of Fig. 2, illustrating that the exterior cover 55 constituting a part of the design surface of the body cover 4 5 is mounted to the pocket portion 61 via screw members 91.<br>
An arm mounting portion 92 as a mounting seat for the hinge arm 84 is formed in the circumferential wall 78 of the pocket portion 61, thus allowing fixing of the hinge arm 84 to the pocket portion 61. [0041]<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken along the line 8-8 of Fig. 7. A boss portion 93 into which the screw member 91 is screwed is formed in the back surface of the exterior cover 55. The screw member 91 is screwed in the boss portion 93. Since the mounting structure for the other screw members 91 is the same as the above-mentioned structure, description thereof is omitted. [0042]<br>
Since the exterior cover 55 is detachably mounted to the pocket portion 61, it is possible to design the pocket portion 61 without consideration of the shape, outward appearance, and the like of the exterior cover 55, That is, the degree of freedom in setting the shape of the pocket portion 61 can be enhanced. If there is no need to consider the outward appearance and the like of the pocket portion 61, a large capacity can be secured for the pocket portion 61 as compared with a case where the exterior cover 55 is integrated with the pocket portion 61.<br>
Returning to Fig, 7, while the number of the screw members<br><br>
91 is three in this embodiment, this should not be construed restrictively. An arbitrary number of the screw members 91, for example, two, four, or five, can be set. [0043]<br>
Fig. 9 is a sectional view taken along the line 9-9 of Fig. 7. The exterior cover 55 mounted to the pocket portion 61 in an integrated manner is provided with the holding portion 94 which, when the pocket portion 61 is closed, locks the pocket portion 61 onto the leg shield 56, thereby holding the pocket portion 61 in a closed state. [0044]<br>
The holding portion 94 includes: a shaft portion 95; a lever member 99 that is rotatably attached to the^ shaft portion 95, and has one end 96a made to serve as a lever portion 96 into which an occupant or the like inserts a finger, and the other end 96b made to serve as an engaging portion 98 engaged with a claw portion 97 provided on the leg shield side; and a spring member 101 that urges the lever member 99 to the side opposite to the arrow a in the drawing.<br>
To open the pocket portion 61 from a closed position, a finger F is hooked onto the lever portion 96, and the lever member 99 is rotated in the direction of the arrow a, thereby releasing the lock of the pocket portion 61. [0045]<br>
