The present invention relates to longitudinally extending cable filler. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a cable channel filler having a shield,<br>
formed from a foil tape, embedded therein and having a plurality of shield legs with<br>
the shield legs forming a plurality of channel filler/cable pockets.<br>
BACKGROUND of the INVENTION<br>
Electronic cables provide a highway through which much of today's digital<br>
information travels. Many of the cables which transmit digital information utilize a<br>
plurality of twisted pair cables. These twisted pair cables, to satisfy high-speed digital<br>
requirements, need to transmit information at high frequencies. Unfortunately, high<br>
frequencies, generally transmitted at extremely low voltages, are susceptible to<br>
electronic interference. For instance, near end cross talk between twisted pairs within<br>
the same cable, referred to in the industry as NEXT, can interfere with high frequency<br>
signal transmission.<br>
To control NEXT in unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables, the industry<br>
typically resorts to extremely short lay lengths and/or a central channel filler member<br>
that acts to physically separate the twisted pairs in order to improve cross talk<br>
performance. The ultimate control for cross talk is to individually shield	<br><br>
the twisted pairs (ISTP) and electrically isolate them from one another by<br>
grounding the common shield plane. Though effective, these cables are typically<br>
quite expensive to purchase and install.<br>
US. Patents 5,789,711,5,969,295 and 5,519,173 each describe methods<br>
used to physically separate twisted pairs with a shaped central filler in UTP or<br>
screen twisted pair cables. These configurations provide some Isolation due to<br>
physical separation of the UTP's, but do not provide the benefit of a conductive<br>
isolating member between the pairs.<br>
jJ^. patent 5,952,615 describes the embodiment of an ISTP cable that<br>
utilizes a central rod filler surrounded with a shield, and an overall shield to fully<br>
isolate each twisted pair. This configuration typically requires that the shielding<br>
members be grounded and is contrary to my UTP invention. In addition, one<br>
embodiment proposes two metal tapes inside the fins of the central rod filler<br>
configures in a crucifomi shape. This configurafion of the two metal tapes is not<br>
desirable in that it allows the possibility of electromagnefic leakage between the<br>
joining point of the two tapes. In addition, the close proximity of the shield<br>
sun^ounding the entire circumference of the twisted pairs adversely affects^the<br>
impedance and attenuafion of the cable's twisted pairs. To maintain required<br>
impedance and attenuation values, the ISTP design requires that additional<br>
insulation material and copper volume be added to the twisted pairs, increasing<br>
the size and cost of the cable, both undesirable. Also, the proximity of the shield<br>
adversely affects the stability of electrical parameters such as impedance,<br>
attenuation and return loss.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,819,443 describes a shielding member comprised of<br>
X<br>
3.<br><br>
laminated strips of metal and plastic materials that are cut, bent and assembled<br>
to define radial branches of a shielding member. This configuration also has<br>
many of the same problems previously described. The assembly of the tapes<br>
allows a channel for electromagnetic leakage to be transmitted from opposite<br>
pairs.<br>
SUMMARY of the INVENTION<br>
Our cable improves the isolation of a plurality of twisted pairs from each other by<br>
having a channel filler with a plurality of longitudinally extending tubular pockets<br>
and an Internal metal shield. In some instances, It is preferred that the channel<br>
filler cable pockets have a cross-sectional area that is equal to or greater than<br>
the diameter of the envelope area of the wire(s) or cable(s) that are to be placed<br>
in each of the pockets. The metal shield is embedded in the channel filler to<br>
isolate each of the channel filler pockets. The channel filler shield is preferably<br>
a single tape that is folded to the confomnity of the shape of the channel filler and<br>
extends into and is embedded by each of the pocket legs. The single shield<br>
tape is folded to provide a plurality of fins or legs so that there is a shield leg for<br>
each of the channel filler pocket legs. We also provide an improved two tape<br>
shield. In the two tape shield a first shield tape is folded to provide the plurality<br>
of shield legs and the second shield tape provides one shield leg. The second<br>
shield leg has 20 - 50 % -at least 1/16 inch of one side thereof being encased<br>
by a folded over portion of one of the first shield tape legs.<br>
A communication cable manufactured using the channel filler of our invention<br>
X<br>
^<br><br>
generally has an unshielded twisted pair cable in each pocket. Then the twisted<br>
pair containing channel filler is jacketed.<br>
The present invention and the advantages thereof will become more apparent<br>
upon consideration of the following detailed description when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
&gt;<br><br>
The following description taken In conjunction with the drawings will further<br>
explain the Inventive features of our elongated channel filler and cables utilizing<br>
our elongated channel filler.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, our elongated channel filler shield 20 has along its cross-<br>
sectional plane a first leg 21. a second leg 22, a third leg 23, and a fourth leg<br>
24. The shield Is made from a single tape having a width equal to about six<br>
times the width of each leg when all of the legs 21-24 have equal widths. The<br>
shield legs 22 and 24 are folded legs to provide a thickness double the thickness<br>
of shield legs 21 and 23. The shield in FIG. 1 is formed by folding the tape 90<br>
degrees at a first point 50 to form a first segment 52, which is the first leg 23 of<br>
the shield. The first segment 52 is approximately 1/6 of the total width of the<br>
tape. The tape is then folded 180 degrees at a second point 54 to form a<br>
second segment 56 and a third segment 58, which forms the second 24 leg of<br>
the shield. The second segment is approximately 1/6 and the third segment is<br>
approximately 2/6 of the total width of the tape. The tape is then folded 180<br>
degrees at a third point 60 to create a fourth segment 62, completing the third<br>
leg 22 of the shield. Lastly, the tape is folded 90 degrees at a fourth point 64,<br>
creating the fourth leg 21 of the shield. The second, third and fourth segments<br>
56, 58 and 62 are compressed, eliminating gaps therebetween. The space<br>
between each leg creates pockets 66 adapted to accept the placement of<br>
twisted pair cables 42 as shown in FIG. 9. Each pocket 66 has a 90 degree<br>
inner edge and are defined by two legs of the shield and by a cable jacket 43.<br>
Since there are no breaks in the one piece shield, frequency interference from<br>
X<br><br>
each pocket is significantly reduced over previous shield designs.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, our shield 25, all four legs 26,27,28 and 29 have a double<br>
layer of shield tape. The double layers are engaging each other when the shield<br>
tape is imbedded in a channel filler. By folding a single piece of shield tape into<br>
this configuration, it is possible to place a drain wire or strengthening member<br>
45 at the converging point 68 of the four legs 26,27, 28 and 29, shown in FIG.<br>
10. With this configuration, each leg 26,27, 28 and 29 has a length<br>
approximately 1/8 of the total width of the tape. The benefit of the shield 25 is<br>
that each leg 26,27,28 and 29 is comprised of two segments of tape, allowing<br>
the use of thinner tape.<br>
FIG. 3 another of our shields 30 made from a single tape folded to provide for<br>
double layer "T"_shield legs 31,32,33 and 34. The legs. 31,32,33 and 34, and<br>
the top 70 of the "T", are double layered and shaped to coincide with the shape<br>
of the side ends of the channel filler legs, as shown in FIG, 11. This design<br>
further reduces Interference by partially closing off the pockets 72 that contain<br>
the twisted pair cables. By folding a single piece of shield tape into this<br>
configuration, it is possible to place a drain wire or strengthening member 45 at<br>
the converging point 74 of the four legs 31, 32, 33 and 34.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, there is shown another of our channel filler shield 35 made<br>
of two shield tapes and having shield legs 36,37, 38 and 39. Legs 36, 37 and<br>
38 are made with a single shield tape with leg 37 being folded over to provide a<br>
7<br><br>
double layered leg. Leg 39 "is fomned by the second tape and has 20-50% - at<br>
least 1/16 inch of one side encased between the folded over portions of shield<br>
leg 37. The at least 1/16 in. encased portion is needed prevent the leg 39 from<br>
disengaging from between the folded portions of the leg 37. When assembled,<br>
leg 39 is placed between the segments of the leg 37. By utilizing a two tape<br>
shield of this design, electromagnetic leakage between the joining point of the<br>
two tapes is eliminated because of the overlap between the tapes.<br>
Referring to Figs 5-8, there are shown different shapes of channel fillers having<br>
embedded therein any one of the shields of FIGS. 1,2, and 4. Since the foil<br>
tape is flexible, it is possible to bend the legs into a position that conforms with<br>
the shape of the channel fillers. By using the shields of FIGS. 1, 2 and 4, it is<br>
possible to form the shield from the tape and apply the filler in a continuous<br>
operation, eliminating steps need for other cable designs.<br>
The preferred material for the elongated channel filler is any suitable polymer or<br>
copolymer depending on the needs of the user for crush resistance, breaking<br>
strength, gel fillings, safety, and the need for flame and smoke resistance. In<br>
many applications the material will be a flame retardant polyethylene or polyvinyl<br>
chloride. Since the filler is a polymer material, it is possible to apply the filler in<br>
various shapes to accommodate cable design requirements. The filler is<br>
designed to follow the contours of the shield and to further insulate the pockets<br>
and add overall strength to the finished cable. The cross section of the filler 86<br>
with the embedded shield 88, shown in FIG. 5, illustrates a plus-symbol shaped<br>
filler that has four legs 76,78, 80 and 82 that define the pockets 84. The cross<br><br><br>
section of the filler 90 with the embedded shield 92 in FIG. 6 illustrates the shield<br>
92 with the legs 94, 96,98 and 100 in a perpendicular orientation. The filler 90<br>
surrounds the shield 92. The tips of the legs 94, 96, 98 and 100 are rounded,<br>
which conforms to the shape of the cable. The inner edges 102 are also<br>
rounded to create a curved pocket 104. FIG. 7 illustrates a shield 106 and a<br>
filler 108 with curved tips 110 that conform with certain cable design<br>
requirements. Since the shield 106 is flexible, it is possible to fonn it into the<br>
desired shape. FIG. 8 illustrates a shield 112 and a filler 114 that is formed so<br>
that pockets 116 and 118 have an interior angle 120 smaller than pockets 122<br>
and 124. This filler design is used In cables having an oval or rectangular cross-<br>
section.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, there is shown a cable 40, having as its core our elongated<br>
channel filler 126 with first pair of diametrically opposed pockets 128 and 130<br>
each containing an unshielded twisted pair cable 42, and second pair of pockets<br>
132 and 134 each also containing an unshielded twisted pair cable 42. The<br>
core 136 which contains our elongated channel filler 126 has an embedded<br>
shield 138, and the cables 42, in its pockets. The core is sunounded by a<br>
jacket 43 which was extruded thereover. The jacket 43 can be any suitable<br>
jacket material normally utilized such as foamed on non-foamed polyvinyl<br>
chloride, fluorinated polymers, polyethylene, the flame retardant compositions,<br>
etc.<br>
Each unshielded twisted pair cable 42 has a pair of conductors with appropriate<br>
^<br>
1<br><br>
insulation 140. The conductors are generally copper, tinned copper, or any other<br>
appropriate conductor. The conductor insulation 140 is a foamed or non-foamed<br>
insulation of polyethylene, polypropylene, fluorinated ethylene propylene,<br>
tetrafluoroethylene, polyvinyl chloride, etc.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, there Is shown a channel filler 150 having an embedded<br>
shield 152 and a drain wire 45 located in opening 68. The channel filler has the<br>
same shield construction as the shield of FIG. 2. In this embodiment, the drain<br>
wire 45 is between double layers of the channel filler shield 152.<br>
Generally for a communication cable having four twisted pair cables, all of the<br>
same size with or without different lays, uses our shield channel filler. The<br>
channel filler has a diameter of about 0.150 inches to about 0.350 inches. The<br>
size of the twisted pair cables 42 are generally about 24 AWG to about 22<br>
AWG. For other applications, the channel filler will have as many pockets or<br>
pocket legs as needed. For instance, in a four pair cable, the channel filler will<br>
have four pocket legs, in a 10 pair cable, the channel filler would have 10 pocket<br>
legs. Likewise, the embedded shield would have 4 and 10 shield legs<br>
respectively.<br>
The shields may be any suitable shield such as an aluminum or copper tape,<br>
BELDFOIL, DUOFOIL, or any suitable metal tape. The shield which uses a<br>
polymer base can have aluminum or copper on one of both sides of the polymer<br>
base. The thickness of the metal on the shield is about 0.0003 to 0.001 inches.<br>
^<br>
P<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 11, there is shown a channel filler 142 having an embedded<br>
shield 144 and a drain wire or strengthening member 45. The channel filler has<br>
the same shield construction as the shield of FIG. 3. In this embodiment, the<br>
drain wire is between the double layers of the channel filler shield.<br>
The drain wire, is generally made with tinned copper, tinned aluminum, etc. the<br>
strength member is generally made from polyethylene.<br>
