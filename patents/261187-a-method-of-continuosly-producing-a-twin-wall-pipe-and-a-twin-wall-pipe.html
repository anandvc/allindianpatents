TITLE<br>
"METHOD OF CONTINUOUSLY PRODUCING A TWIN-WALL PIPE WITH A<br>
SOCKET, TWIN-WALL PIPE AND APPARATUS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE<br>
METHOD AND FOR PRODUCING THE TWIN-WALL PIPE"<br>
APPLICANT<br>
HEGLER, Ralph, Peter<br>
Schillerstrasse 7<br>
D-97688 Bad Kissingen Germany<br>
Nationality: a German citizen<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br><br>
The invention relates to a method according to the preamble of claim 1, a twin-wall pipe according to the preamble of claim 6 and an apparatus ac¬cording to the preamble of claim 9.<br>
EP 0 563 575 A2 (corresponding to US 5 320 797) describes a method, twin-wall pipe and apparatus of the generic type. The greater the nominal widths of corrugated pipes, the more grow the elevations and thus the increase in size of the pipe socket in relation to the inside diameter of the twin-wall pipe. This is due to the fact that the standard twin-wall pipe is very often used as a spigot, meaning that a twin-wall pipe is inserted by its elevations into the socket. The transition portions between the twin-wall pipe that leads during in-line production and the pipe socket on the one hand, and the pipe socket and the lagging twin-wall pipe on the other, possess considerable radial extension. In particular the transition portion between a twin-wall pipe and socket, which remains after separation of the extruded continuous run of pipe, must possess pronounced radial extension i.e., must be directed steeply outwards in relation to the central longitudinal axis, so that, upon insertion of the spigot into the socket as far as to the transition portion, there will be no dead space, nor considerable dead space, where dirt might deposit. The greater the nominal widths and/or the higher the production rate, the greater the risk that the internal tube does not adhere by its full face to the external tube in the vicinity of the transition por¬tion and at the beginning and end of the socket.<br>
It is an object of the invention to embody a method, a twin-wall pipe and an apparatus of the respective species in such a way that full-face adherence, and thus welding, of the internal tube to the external tube is achieved in the vicinity of the transition portion.<br><br>
According to the invention, this object is attained by the features of the characterizing part of claim 1 for a method, the characterizing part of claim 6 for a twin-wall pipe, and the characterizing part of claim 9 for an appara¬tus.<br>
The gist of the invention resides in that the space between the internal tube and the external tube is vented in the vicinity of the transition portion where the twin-wall pipe passes into the socket so that the internal tube, by the pressure that acts on it from inside, is pressed full face against the corresponding area of the external pipe and welded thereto. Venting does not take place outwards, but into the adjacent elevation and possibly another adjacent elevation. This is sufficient, given the minor quantities of air to be displaced. It is important to implement the design according to the inven¬tion at the portion of transition between the twin-wall pipe and socket that will remain between the socket and twin-wall pipe in the finished twin-wall pipe. After in-line production of the twin-wall pipe, a transition portion between socket and twin-wall pipe is cut out. This transition portion may be featured according to the invention, which is however not necessary.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments will become apparent from the subclaims.<br>

Line X IV-XI V of Fig. 12.<br>
The installation seen in Fig. 1 for the manufacture of twin-wall pipes comprises two extruders 1, 2. Each of them is driven by a variable speed driv¬ing motor 3 and 3' which, related to the conveying direction 4 of the entire installation, is provided upstream of the feed hoppers 5 of the extrud¬ers 1, 2.<br>
Downstream of the extruders 1, 2 as seen in the conveying direction 4, provision is made for a molding machine 6, a so-called corrugator, which is followed by an after cooler 7. A crosshead 8, which projects into the molding machine 6, is mounted on the extruder 1 which is in alignment with the molding machine 6 and the aftercooler 7. The other extruder 2, by the side of the extruder 1, is connected to the crosshead 8 by way of an injection channel 9 which discharges laterally into the crosshead 8. As diagrammatically outlined in Fig. 1, a twin-wall pipe 10 is molded in the molding ma-<br><br>
chine 6; it leaves the molding machine 6 in the conveying direction 4 and is cooled in the aftercooler 7. Downstream of the aftercooler 7, it can then be cut into pieces of appropriate length.<br>
The design of the molding machine 6 is known and common practice. It is described for example in EP 0 563 575 Bl (corresponding to U.S. patent 5 320 797), to which reference is made explicitly. It substantially com¬prises a machine bed 11 with half shells 12, 12' disposed thereon, which are joined to each other, constituting two so-called chains 13, 13'. These chains 13, 13' are guided along deflection rollers (not shown) at the upstream inlet 14 and the downstream outlet 15 seen in the conveying direction 4. When circulating in the conveying direction 4, they are guided such that every two half shells 12, 12' are united into a pair, with pairs of shells closely succeeding to each other in the conveying direction 4. A driving motor 17 serves for actuation of the half shells 12, 12' which are united on a molding path 16, forming pairs of shells.<br>
The crosshead 8 comprises two melt channels which are concentric of a joint central longitudinal axis 18, namely an inner melt channel 19 and an outer melt channel 20 which, seen in the conveying direction 4, terminate downstream in an inner die 21 and outer die 22. The inner melt channel 19 is connected to an injection channel 23 of the extruder 1 which is in align¬ment with the molding machine 6, whereas the outer melt channel 20 is connected to the injection channel 9 of the other extruder 2. Between the inner die 21 and the outer die 22, a gas duct 24 discharges from the cross-head 8, the gas duct 24 on the one hand being connectable by way of a valve to a source of compressed gas for so-called stabilizing air to be blown in or on the other hand to atmosphere or partial vacuum.<br><br>
A calibrating mandrel 25, which is also concentric of the axis 18, is mounted on the extrusion head 8 at the downstream end thereof seen in the conveying direction 4. It has cooling channels 26 for cooling water which is supplied via a cooling-water flow pipe 27 and led off via a cooling-water return pipe 28. Further provision is made for an air pipe 29 connected to a gas gap 30 which serves as an additional gas duct and, as seen in the conveying direction 4, is located directly downstream of the inner die 21 between the extrusion head 8 and the calibrating mandrel 25. The pipes 27, 28, 29 pass through an approximately tubular supply channel 31 which is provided in the extrusion head 8 concentrically of the axis 18.<br>
The half shells 12, 12' have annular mold recesses 32, 32' that succeed to each other at regular distances, each of them being connected to partial-vacuum channels 33. Upon arrival of the half shells 12, 12' on the molding path 16, the partial-vacuum channels 33 reach partial-vacuum supply sources 35 and 36 so that partial vacuum is admitted to the mold recesses 32.<br>
The plastic melt, which is supplied by the extruder 2 through the injection channel 9 and to the extrusion head 8, flows through the outer melt channel 20 to the outer die 22 where it is extruded, forming an external tube 37. Owing to the partial vacuum, this tube 37 gets seated in the mold recesses 32, 32', forming a tube that is provided with annular elevations 38. Plastic melt is supplied from the extruder 1 through the injection channel 23 to the extrusion head 8, flowing through the inner melt channel 19 towards the inner die 21 where it discharges as an internal tube 39 that approaches the calibrating mandrel 25. The calibrating mandrel 25 expands slightly outwards from the inner die 21 on in the conveying direction 4 until the internal tube 39 bears against the corrugation troughs 40 of the external tube 37<br><br>
where both of them are welded together. Once cooled and solidified, the internal tube 39 and the external tube 37 constitute the twin-wall pipe 10.<br>
As seen in particular in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7, the half shells 12, 12f are designed for pipe sockets 41 to form at regular distances within the continuous twin-wall pipe 10. To this end, a socket recess 42 is formed in a pair of half shells 12, 12', having a substantially smooth, cylindrical wall 43. A transition area 44 is formed between the wall 43 of the socket recess 42 and the mold recess 32 that leads in the conveying direction 4. The lagging end, as seen in the conveying direction 4, of the wall 43 of the socket recess 42 is followed by peripheral grooves 34 for reinforcement of the socket 41 and a truncated mold portion 45 where an insertion end 46 of the socket 41 is formed, expanding outwards. This is again followed by a transition area 47 that leads to the next mold recess 32 which lags as seen in the conveying direction 4.<br>
As far as described hereinbefore, the apparatus is substantially known from EP 0 995 579 A2 (corresponding to U.S. patent 6 458 311), to which reference is made explicitly.<br>
As seen in Figs. 3 to 7, on the transition area 44 that leads in the conveying direction and on the transition area 47 that lags in the conveying direction 4, slotted recesses 50, 51, which run in the direction of the axis 18, are formed in the vicinity of the produced corrugation trough 40 on the annular rib 48 and 49 that forms the respective transition area 44 and 47, of the half shell 12, 12\ These recesses 50, 51 connect the respective transition area 44 and 47 to the next adjacent annular elevation 38. The recesses 50, 51 of each annular rib 48, 49 are interconnected by connecting grooves 52, 53<br><br>
which extend along the periphery of the respective transition area 44 and 47 and are formed therein.<br>
As seen in Figs. 3, 4, 6, 7, the half shell 12 that locates the socket recess 42 is sufficiently long for the annular ribs 48, 49 to be completely contained therein. Unlike Fig. 2 which, in this regard, is merely a diagrammatic illus¬tration, the separation of adjacent half shells 12 does not take place through the annular rib 48 and 49, which is advantageous in terms of manufacture. With the socket recess 42 being sufficiently long to reach over more than one half shell 12, then this applies correspondingly to these half shells 12.<br>
By locally defined allocation to the socket recess 42, a rod-shaped switch member 55 is connected to the corresponding half shell 12, operating a switch 56 by means of which to modify the speed and thus the extrusion rate of the extruders 1, 2 and by means of which to supply the gas duct 24 and the gas gap 30. To this end, an arm 57 is mounted on the molding ma¬chine 6, running in the conveying direction 4 above the half shells 12, 12'. This is where the switch 56 is mounted which is operated by the switch member 55. As seen in Figs. 3 to 5, this switch 56 is being operated. The jobs of modifying the speed of the extruder 2 that furnishes the plastic melt for manufacture of the external tube 37, triggering the so-called stabilizing air that flows from the gas duct 24, venting via this gas duct 24, triggering the gas gap 30 at the calibrating mandrel 25, and finally modifying the speed and thus the extrusion rate of the extruder 1 which furnishes the plastic melt for manufacture of the internal tube 39, take place via the software of a control system to which the switch 56, upon operation, transmits a ref¬erence signal.<br><br>
Upon manufacture of the standard corrugated twin-wall pipe 10 in the way seen in Fig. 3 at the right, the external tube 37 is retracted by the partial vacuum into the mold recesses 32 where it adheres. Low overpressure of 0.05 to 0.15 bar above atmospheric is admitted to the gas gap 30. Simultaneously, low, but slightly higher overpressure of 0.2 to 0.3 bar above at¬mospheric is admitted to the gas duct 24. This low overpressure within the internal tube 39 prevents it from sticking to the calibrating mandrel 25 prior to being welded to the external tube 37. It is just as well possible, instead of overpressure, to apply partial vacuum to the gas gap 30. The slightly higher overpressure between the external tube 37 and the internal tube 39 ensures that the internal tube 39 does not bulge radially outwards into the elevation 38 when the tubes 37, 39, which are welded together at the corrugation troughs 40, cool down to form the corrugated twin-wall pipe 10. Exact atmospheric pressure between the tubes 37, 39 ensues when they cool down. During this manufacture of the standard corrugated twin-wall pipe 10, the extruders 1, 2 work at a given speed, i.e. they extrude a constant flow of plastic melt per unit of time. Depending on the properties of the plastic melt the internal tube 39 consists of, partial vacuum at the calibrating mandrel 25 may help obtain a smooth inner surface of the inter¬nal tube 39 and, consequently, of the later internal pipe 39', this being so-called vacuum calibration.<br>
When the transition area 44 moves into the vicinity of the outer die 22 at the instant seen in Fig. 3, the switch member 55 reaches the switch 56, by actuation of which the speed of the driving motor 3' of the extruder 2 de¬creases, reducing the extrusion rate i.e., the flow of plastic melt per unit of time. As a result of the reduction in speed of the extruder 2, the external tube 37, which gets seated on the transition area 44 and the wall 43 of the socket recess 42 by reason of the partial vacuum, contains less plastic ma-<br><br>
terial per unit of length of the twin-wall pipe 10 than in such area of the standard corrugated twin-wall pipe 10 where it is shaped into an external pipe 37 with elevations 38. Depending on the degree to which the speed is reduced, the wall thickness in the vicinity of the socket 41 can be equal to, or greater or less than, that in the vicinity of the elevations 38 of the twin-wall pipe 10. Corresponding adaptation or modification of the wall thickness in the vicinity of the socket 41 can also be attained in known manner by increase of the speed of the half shells 12, 12' that constitute the mold 32. On the other hand, an increase in wall thickness in the vicinity of the socket 41 can also be obtained by increasing the speed of the extruder 2 and, respectively, reducing the speed of the mold 32.<br>
When the transition area 44 reaches the inner die 21, corresponding approximately to the illustration of Fig. 4, the overpressure or low pressure of the air that leaves the gas gap 30 is being raised for example to an over¬pressure of approximately 0.2 to 0.45 bar. Simultaneously the gas-duct-24 overpressure is being cancelled, the gas duct 24 being connected to a vac¬uum source or to atmosphere, so that the clearance 58 between the internal tube 39 and external tube 37 in the vicinity of the socket recess 42 is being vented. The internal tube 39 is being pressed outwards against the external tube 37.<br>
As seen in Figs. 4 and 5, the external tube 37 gets seated on the annular rib 48 and the transition area 44, with an overflow passage 59 being simultaneously formed in the vicinity of the slotted recesses 50, leading into the adjacent elevation 38. At the transition area 44, the external tube 37 also gets placed in the connecting grooves 52, thereby forming connecting pas¬sages 60 in the molded external pipe 37'. The internal tube 39, by the pressure prevailing therein, is forced against the external tube 37, but it is not<br><br>
pressed or molded into the overflow passages 59 and the connecting passages 60 so that these passages 59, 60 are maintained between the external tube 37 and the internal tube 39. The air located in this area can flow off into the elevation 38 that leads in the conveying direction. In the transition portion 61 between the standard twin-pipe 10 and the in-line molded socket 41, the external tube 37 and the internal tube 39 are being welded together nearly full face. This connection by welding does not exist in the vicinity of the overflow passages 59 and the connecting passages 60. This design enables the transition portion 61, related to the conveying direction 4, to be embodied strongly radial i.e., ascending comparatively steeply.<br>
When the transition area has passed the inner die 21, the driving motor 3 of the extruder 1 is being triggered in such a way that for instance its speed rises, which means that the flow rate per unit of time of the plastic melt is increased. Consequently, more plastic melt per unit of length is supplied to the internal tube 39 in the vicinity of the produced socket 41 than in the vicinity of the standard corrugated twin-wall pipe 10 where only the smooth internal pipe 39' is made from it.<br>
When the transition area 47 of the socket recess 42 passes the outer die 22, the extrusion rate of the extruder 2 that delivers the external tube 37 is be¬ing set back to the original rate. The extruder 2 again supplies the amount per unit of time of the plastic melt that is necessary for producing the ele¬vations 38. The external tube 37 rests on the transition area 47 and the con¬necting grooves 53 formed therein, thus producing connecting passages 62 in the external tube. Then the external tube bears against the annular rib 49 and is molded into the slotted recesses 51, forming overflow passages 63.<br><br>
When the transition area 47 reaches the inner die 21, then the gas pressure that acts at the gas gap 30 is again reduced and compressed air and so-called stabilizing air is admitted to the gas duct 24, which means the process returns to conditions that prevail upon manufacture of the standard twin-wall pipe 10. When the transition area 47 has passed the inner die 21, the driving motor 3 is being triggered, whereby the extrusion rate of the extruder 1 is reduced to the original rate so that again the amount of plastic melt per unit of time is extruded that is needed for manufacture of the smooth internal pipe 39\ As mentioned, the internal tube 39 smoothly bears against the external tube 37 without however being pressed into the connecting passages 62 and the overflow passages 63. In this way, the air in the transition portion 64 between the socket 41 and a lagging standard twin-wall pipeline, as seen in the direction of conveying 4, escapes into the subsequent elevation 38.<br>
As seen in Fig. 7, an additional compressed-air duct 65 can be provided in the calibrating mandrel 25 through which, by corresponding compressed-air actuation, once again to act by compressed air on the internal tube 39 that is still in a condition for molding, as a result of which any air in the vicinity of the transition portions 61 and 64 is led off through the passages 59, 60 and 62, 63 into the adjacent elevations 38. The additional, short-term compressed-air actuation takes place only when the annular rib 48 that leads in the conveying direction 4 as well as the annular rib 49 that lags in the conveying direction 4 and the socket recess 42 there-between are located completely over the calibrating mandrel 25, sealing taking place of the space inside the produced socket 41 in the conveying direction 4 and against the conveying direction 4 by the plastic melt located in the corruga¬tion troughs 40 between the annular ribs 48, 49 and the calibrating mandrel<br><br>
25. Triggering the compressed air that is supplied via the compressed-air duct 65 takes place in the way described above by way of the switch 56.<br>
The twin-wall pipe of continuous in-line production, illustrated in particular in Fig. 8, is cut through in the vicinity of the transition area 47 that lags in the conveying direction 4, which is implemented by two cuts 66, 67, the cut 66 of which that lags in the conveying direction 4 being made through a corrugation trough 40 after the transition portion 64, whereas the cut 67 that leads in the conveying direction 4 is made along the insertion end 46 of the socket 41.<br>
It is also conceivable, instead of two extruders 1, 2 and a crosshead 8, to use a single extruder and a crosshead as known for example from EP 0 509 216 B (corresponding to U.S. patent 5 346 384) and EP 0 834 386 B (corresponding to U.S. patent 6 045 347), to which reference is made.<br><br>
