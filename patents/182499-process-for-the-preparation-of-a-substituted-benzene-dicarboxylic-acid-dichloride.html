This invention refers to a new process for the synthesis of S-5-[[2-(acetyloxy)-1-oxopropyl]amino]-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid dichloride of formula (I).<br><br>
The compound of formula (I) has been previously described in patent GB 1472050 and used as intermediate for the synthesis of S-N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-l-(hydroxyme-thyl)ethyl]-5-[(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropyl)amino]-2,4,6-tri-iodol,3-benzenedicarboxamide, from now on called Compound A.<br>
The synthesis of the compound of formula (I) described in the above mentioned patent foresees the following reaction as in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
The reaction of 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid dichloride (compound of formula (II)) is carried out, according to GB 1472050, with 2.5 equivalents of S-(- )-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride, in dimethylacetamide at 3-5°C.<br>
Recently, patent application GB 2271990 has been published, which describes a process for the preparation of compound (I) characterized by the use, in the reaction of Scheme 1, of a Lewis acid in catalytic amounts. According to the authors, the improvement brought by the invention lies in the quantitative conversions. The reaction solvent can be varied thus avoiding the drawbacks deriving from the removal of dimethylacetamide.<br>
As previously cited, Compound A is a product containing a chiral centre and whose pharmacopoeia standards (for instance USP XXV; FU IX ed.) indicate a specific minimum rotatory optical power ranging between [a]436 = -4.6° and -5.2° (c = 40, H20).<br>
It has been found, and this is one of the aspects of this invention, that the reaction of the Scheme 1<br><br>
when carried out in dimethylacetamide or in another aprotic dipolar solvent, in presence of an halogenhydric acid, leads to a reaction mixture containing an optical and chemical pure final product.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention refers to a in¬dustrially convenient process for the purification of this reaction mixture, which leads to the pure product of formula (I) in high yield and with a specific rota¬tory optical power ranging between [a]D = -13.7 and -14.7° (c = 10, CH3CN) and with a chemical purity better than 99%. Said product, used as intermediate in the synthesis of Compound A, leads to a contrast agent which meets the pharmacopoeia standards and particularly those referring to specific rotatory optical power.<br>
Therefore, the scope of this invention is a process for the preparation of the compound of formula (I)/ which comprises the reaction between S-(-)-[2-(acetyloxy)]propionic acid chloride with the compound of formula (II), 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicar-boxylic acid dichloride, in an aprotic dipolar solvent and in presence of a halogenhydric acid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the aprotic dipolar solvent is selected from the group con¬sisting of N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, preferably N,N-dime-thylacetamide.<br>
Particularly preferred are the conditions of reac¬tion, in which the halogenhydric acid is added as an anhydrous gas in a 0.1:3 molar ratio for the product of formula (II).<br>
Equally preferred are the conditions of reaction<br><br>
under which the amount of halogenhydric acid is added as a salt of the above cited aprotic dipolar solvents. Par¬ticularly preferred is the dimethylacetamide hydrochlo¬ride.<br>
Equally preferred are the conditions of reaction, under which the temperature ranges between 0 and 40°C.<br>
This invention also refers to the process for the purification and isolation of S-5-[[2-(acetyloxy)-l-oxo-propyl]amino]-2,4, 6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylie acid dichloride coming from the reaction of formation of the same.<br>
It has been found that the dilution of the reaction mix¬ture, containing the final product and the aprotic dipo¬lar solvent, with a solvent selected from the group con¬sisting of: acetic acid esters with linear or branched (C3-C5) alcohols; secondary or tertiary alcohols, linear or branched (C3-C5); mono-, di- or polychloro (C1-C4) alkanes, followed by addition of water allows the iso¬lation of the desired product with excellent yield, the removal of the aprotic dipolar solvent in an easy and complete way, and gives a product which has all the ne¬cessary chemical-physical characteristics to carry out the synthesis of Compound A in accordance with pharmaco¬poeia standards.<br>
This invention also refers to the process of puri¬fication and isolation of S-(-)-5-[[2-(acetyloxy)-l-oxo-propyl]amino]-2,4,6-triiodo-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid dichloride, comprising the following steps:<br>
the dilution of the reaction mixture with acetic<br>
acid esters with linear or branched (C3-C5) al-<br><br>
conois or mono-, cu- or polycnioro (C1-C4) alkanes<br>
in a ratio between the dilution solvent and the<br>
aprotic dipolar solvent of 0.3:1 to 2.5:1 w/w;<br>
the extraction of the aprotic dipolar solvent with<br>
water in a ratio of water to the dilution solvent<br>
ranging from 0.5:1 to 4:1 w/w;<br>
the precipitation of the product with water.<br>
Particularly preferred are the solvents selected from propyl acetate, n-butyl acetate and methylchloro-form.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the purifica¬tion of the reaction mixture can be advantageously car¬ried out by using an alternative method based on the use of a continuous extractor, fed by the same solvent used for the dilution of the reaction mixture and with water to the two ends and with the reaction mixture on an in¬termediate plate. The product is isolated by concentra¬tion of the solvent phase. Also in this case the product meets the desired chemical-physical standards of purity.<br>
As far as the use of secondary or tertiary (C^-Cg) linear or branched alcohols is concerned, the dilution can be performed either through the addition of the se¬lected solvent to the reaction mixture, or by adding the reaction mixture to the hydroalcoholic solution contai¬ning the selected alcohol, always in a ratio of dilution solvent to the aprotic dipolar solvent present in the reaction mixture ranging from 0 to 1.5 w/w, preferably in a ratio ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 w/w.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process lor the preparation of S-(-)-5£ [2-(acetyloxy)-1-oxopropyl] aminq]-2,4,6-triipdo-1,3-benzenedicarbdxylic acid dichloride of formula (I)<br><br>
comprising the reaction between S-(-)-[2-(acetyloxy£]propionic acid chloride and 5-amino-2,4,6-triiodo-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid dichloride, in an aprotic dipolar solvent in presence of a halogenhydric acid and recovering the compound of formula I from the reaction mixture by known methods.<br>
