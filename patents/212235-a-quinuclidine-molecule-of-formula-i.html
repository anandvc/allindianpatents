NOVEL QUINUCLIDINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel quinuclidine derivatives and their use as pharmaceuticals. Due to their pharmacological profile the compounds of the invention may be useful for the treatment of diseases or disorders as diverse as those related to the cholinergic system of the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS), diseases or disorders related to smooth muscle contraction, endocrine diseases or disorders, diseases or disorders related to neuro-degeneration, diseases or disorders related to inflammation, pain, and withdrawal symptoms caused by the termination of abuse of chemical substances.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The endogenous cholinergic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, exerts its biological effect via two types of cholinergic receptors, the muscarinic Acetyl Choline Receptors (mAChR) and the nicotinic Acetyl Choline Receptors (nAChR).<br>
It is well established that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are of importance in relation to memory and cognition, and much research aimed at the development of agents for the treatment of memory related disorders have focused on the synthesis of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor modulators.<br>
Indeed several CNS disorders can be attributed to a cholinergic deficiency, a dopaminergic deficiency, an adrenergic deficiency or a serotonergic deficiency.<br>
Brown et al. [Brown et al,: Quinuclidine Inhibitors of 2,3-OxJdosqualene Cyclase-Lanosterol Synthase: Optimization from Lipid Profiles; J. Med. Chem. 1999 42 1306-1311] describe the synthesis of 3-substituted quinuclidine derivatives useful as inhibitors of the cholesterol biosynthesis. An effect on the nicotinic and/or the monoamine receptors is not reported.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is devoted to the provision of new quinuclidine derivatives that are modulators of the nicotinic and/or of the monoamine receptors, and which modulators are useful for the treatment of diseases or disorders related to the cholinergic receptors, and in particular the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the monoamine receptors, in particular the serotonin receptor (5-HTR), the dopamine receptor (DAR) and the norepinephrine receptor (NER), and of the biogenic amine transporters for serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE).<br><br>
Due to their pharmacological profile the compounds of the invention may be useful for the treatment of diseases or disorders as diverse as those related to the cholinergic system of the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS), diseases or disorders related to smooth muscle contraction, endocrine diseases or disorders, diseases or disorders related to neuro-degeneration, diseases or disorders related to inflammation, pain, and withdrawal symptoms caused by the termination of abuse of chemical substances.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be useful as diagnostic tools or monitoring agents in various diagnostic methods, and in particular for in vivo receptor imaging (neuroimaging), and they may be used in labelled or unlabelled form.<br>
Accordingly, in its first aspect the invention provides quinuclidine derivatives represented by Formula I <br>
an enantiomer thereof, or a mixture of its enantiomers, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable addition salt thereof, or an onium salt thereof, wherein,<br>
  represents an optional double bond; n is 1, 2 or 3; X represents a linker selected from -O-, -O-CH2", -O-CH2-CH2-, -S-, -SO-,<br><br>
. A represents a monocyclic or polycyclic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic group, optionally substituted one or more times with substituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyi, cycloalkyl-alkyi, alkoxy, hydroxyalkoxy, alkoxy-alkyl, alkoxy-alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, cycloalkoxy-aikyi, cycloalkoxy-alkoxy, halo, CF3, CN, NO2, NH2, carboxy, carbamoyl, amido, sulfamoyi, and phenyl, or with another monocyclic or polycyclic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic group, which additional monocyclic or polycyclic, carbocyclic or heterocyclic group may optionally be substituted one or more times with substituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyi, cycloalkyl-alkyi, alkoxy, hydroxyalkoxy, alkoxy-alkyl, alkoxy-alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, cycloalkoxy-alkyi, cycloalkoxy-alkoxy, halo, CF3, CN, NO2, NH2, carboxy, carbamoyl, amido, sulfamoyi, and phenyl;<br>

if X represents O or S;<br><br>
then A is not phenyl or phenyl substituted with anything other than a phenyl group (i.e. a biphenyl group).<br>
In another aspect the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the quinudidine derivative of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect the invention relates to the use of the quinudidine derivative of the invention, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable addition salt thereof, for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition/medicament for the treatment, prevention or alleviation of a disease or a disorder or a condition of a mammal, including a human, which disease, disorder or condition is responsive to the action of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor modulator.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a method of the treatment or alleviation of a disease or disorder of a living animal body, including a human, which disease or disorder is responsive to the action of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor modulator, which method comprises the step of administering to such a living animal body, including a human, in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of the quinudidine derivative of the invention-Other objects of the invention will be apparent to the person skilled in the art from the following detailed description and examples.<br>

Biological Activity<br>
In vrtro Inhibition of 3H-α-Bungarotoxine Binding in Rat Brain<br>
in this example the affinity of the compounds of the invention for binding to α-subtype of nicotinic receptors Is determined.<br>
α-Bungarotoxine is a peptide isolated from the venom of the Elapidae snake Bungarus multicinctus. It has high affinity for neuronal and neuromuscular nicotinic receptors, where it acts as a potent antagonist.<br>
3H-α-Bungarotoxine labels nicotinic acetylcholine receptors formed by the α subunit isofor found in brain and the α isoform in the neuromuscular junction.<br><br>
Tissue preparation<br>
Preparations are performed at 0-4X. Cerebral cortices from male Wistar rats (150-250 g) are homogenised for 10 seconds in 15 ml of 20 mM Hepes buffer containing 118 mM NaCI, 4.8 mM KCI, 1.2 mM MgSO4 and 2.5 mM CaCia (pH 7.5) using an Ultra-Turrax homogeniser. The tissue suspension is subjected to centrifugation at 27,000 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet is washed twice by centrifugation at 27,000 x g for 10 minutes in 20 ml of fresh buffer, and the final pellet is then re-suspended in fresh buffer containing 0.01% BSA (35 ml per g of original tissue) and used for binding assays.<br>
Assay<br>
Aliquots of 500 [JI of homogenate are added to 25 pi of test solution and 25 pi of ^H-a-bungarotoxine (2 nM, final concentration) and mixed and incubated for 2 hours at 37'C. Non-specific binding is determined using (-)-nicotine (1 mM, final concentration). After incubation, the samples are added 5 ml of ice-cold Hepes buffer containing 0.05% PEI and poured directly onto Whatman GF/C glass fibre filters (pre-soaked in 0.1% PEI for at least 6 hours) under suction, and immediately washed with 2 X 5 ml ice-cold buffer.<br>
The amount of radioactivity on the filters is determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding is total binding minus non-specific binding.<br>
The test value is given as an IC50 (the concentration of the test substance which inhibits the specific binding of ^H-a-bungarotoxin by 50%).<br>
