				<td>Co-immunization with HIV-1 Vaccinogens and Immunomodulators<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to the augmentation of HIV specific immune response by co-immunization with HIV-1 vaccinogens and immunomodulators like Immunostimulatory sequences (ISS)/CpG motifs/oligodeoxynuclcotides (ODNs), human interleukin-2 (protein or DNA) etc.<br>
Background of Invention;<br>
AIDS is one of the most dreaded infections afflicting the human race today. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).<br>
Several antiretroviral drugs have been introduced to combat this virus infection since last decade. Current therapy of HIV infection requires use of multiple drug combinations which resulted in dramatic improvements in the mortality and morbidity of HIV-disease. Despite all the therapeutic advantages achieved, eradication of the virus still remains impossible. In addition, new problems relating to the occurrence of resistance mutation in both circulating and transmitted viruses are emerging. Development of resistant HIV strains is one of the main reasons of failure of antiretroviral therapy.<br>
In most other viral infections, like measles, chicken pox, or rubella etc. the virus is cleared from the body by an efficient and robust immune response, which an infected patient develops early during the course of infection. This immune response is generally very broad based and is sustained for several weeks and months even after clearing the virus from the body. However, in HIV infection the scenario is different. The virus infects the CD4+T cells which are the key cells required in mounting HIV specific immune response. As a result the immune response in unable to clear the virus from the body in HIV infected individuals and the virus continues to grow in these patients.<br>
Therefore, an alternate approach is to augment the immune response of the infected individual in such a way that the virus, which is not cleared from the body of infected individuals by the antiretroviral drugs are destroyed or cleared by the HIV-1 specific immune response in the patient. The preventive vaccines induce HIV specific immune response which peaks at 4 to 8 weeks after receiving the complete course of HIV immunization. Thereafter, the immune response declines and by 16 weeks post-immunization it is undetectable. However, when the vaccine is challenged with the vaccinogens or the virus, a secondary type of immune response develops suggesting that the individual vaccine has a memory to the vaccinogens. This aspect of the immune response is useful for prevention of infection. For clearing the established virus infection from the body, a sustained and broad based immune response is necessary. This immune response should be maintained at or near its peak for several weeks so that any persisting virus from the body may be cleared. In an alternate approach in the present invention,<br>
co-immunization of HIV-1 vaccinogens International Application No. (PCT/IN2004/000284) with immunomodulators (ISS/CpG motif/ODNs, human interleukin-2 (IL-2) etc.) will augment the virus specific immune response to combat and clear the virus from the body.<br>
Objects of Inventions:<br>
Object of this invention is to propose a co-immunization composition of HIV vaccinogens together with immunomodulators like ISS/CpG motif/ODNs, human IL-2 etc.<br>
Another object of this invention is to show the augmentation of the immune response by the co-immunization.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention:<br>
According to this invention there is provided a method for augmenting the immune response, which may help the patient in combating and controlling the virus replication in them. In accordance with this invention, the immune response in an HIV infected is highly compromised due to uninhibited virus replication in the immune cells particularly CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, which are the key cells in mounting protective immunity. The virus infection results in continuous destruction of these cells. As a result there is no immune surveillance in infected individuals. Lack of immune surveillance results not only to unabated HIV replication but also to several life threatening infections<br>
and malignancies in the infected individuals. Although development of antiretroviral drugs have succeeded in improving the quality of life of the infected patients, the outrageous prohibitive cost of treatment is beyond reach of the majority of patients in developing countries. Further, development of resistance to the antiretroviral treatment and also toxicity in patients on prolonged treatment with these drugs have prompted scientists to develop alternate approached for controlling virus replication in the infected individuals.<br>
However, it has been observed that some HIV infected individuals are able to control the replication of virus through an efficient immune response for several years. These individuals are able to eliminate HIV from the body due to efficient HIV specific cell mediated immune response though are HIV antibody negative. These individuals are called highly exposed seronegative individuals. Indicating thereby that if the immune response of HIV infected is modulated by immunomodulators in the presence of HIV vaccines, the infected individuals may be able to suppress and even eliminate HIV from their body.<br>
According to this invention the immune response can be augmented by coimmunizing the infected individuals with HIV vaccines and immunomodulator s.<br>
Example:<br>
Augmentation of immune response in Mice;<br>
(a)	CpG motif: Unmethylated and phosphothioated CpG motif sequence 5'- TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3' (1826-ODN) was synthesized. This unmethylated ODN has 2 CpG motifs, separated by 7 bases in between them. Incubation of spleen cells from normal mice with of 2 ja.g of CpG motif alone in mice induced production of IFNy from spleen cells which was maximum after 72 hours post-incubation.<br>
(b)	Murine Interleukin-2: Murine IL-2/lg gene was released from pVRCmIL-2/Ig (interleukin-2) construct by restriction digestion with Pst I and Xba I. The released insert was polished by Klenow fragment to create the blunt ends. The expression vector pJW4304 was double digested with Hind III and Mlu I restriction enzymes. The linearised vector was polished by Klenow fragment, followed by CIAP treatment. Blunt end ligation was carried out using T4 DNA ligase. E.coli DH5oc cells were then transformed with recombinant plasmid pJWmIL-2/lg and screening was carried out for positive clones using double restriction digestions with Hind III and Sal I. In vitro expression was the murine IL-2 clone was tested in Cos-7 cells transfected with recombinant plasmid pJW mIL2/lg (interleukin-2). Expression of pJWmIL2/lg (interleukin-2) in Cos-7 cells led to the secretion of IL2 in the culture supenatants. The quantification of secreted IL-2 in the culture supernates was done by the murine IL-2 cytokine ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions, thereby confirming the IL-2 protein expression. The amounts of murine<br><br>
IL-2 cytokine secreted in the medium increased reaching a maximum level at 72 hours post-transfection (2055 pg/ml).<br>
(c) Immune response in mice co-immunized with CpG motif 1826 ODN and/or pJWmIL2/lg (interleukin-2) with HIV-1 Indian subtype C vaccines (pJWSK3 (NK29692CO, NK49426CO), pJWgagprotease49587 (NK49587CO), MVA-SK3 (W29692CO, W49226CO) and MVA-gagprotease49587) (W49587CO)).<br>
The immunization studies were performed in 4 phases. The immunized mice were euthanised a different time points following immunization and the spleen cells were assayed for CTL activity (cell mediated immune response) by IFNy-ELISpot assay and the serum samples were assayed for HIV-1 specific antibodies (humoral immune response) by ELISA. In the Phase-I study, dose response experiment was conducted for the HIV-1 Subtype C constructs pJWSK3 (NK29692CO, NK49426CO) and pJWgagprotease49587 (NK49587CO) to find out the optimum dose of these constructs required to induce optimum immune response in mice. The optimum dose each construct was 50(xg. In phase-II studies optimum dose of CpG motifs (1826-ODN) injected intradermally as immunomodulator along with HIV-1 subtype C DNA constructs (pJWgag-protease49587 (NK49587CO) and pJWSK3 (NK29692CO, NK49426CO)) in mice was tested and was found to be 2(j.g. It was also observed that the immune response augmented by this dose of CpG motif was very broad based at 6 weeks post immunization and was sustained at significantly high levels even at the end of 24 weeks. Whereas, without CpG motif the   immune response induced   by   the   same<br>
vaccinogens was narrow and declined to pre-immunization<br>
levels by 8 weeks after the immunization. In Phase-II study the<br>
optimum dose of pJWmIL-2/lg (Interleukin-2) co-immunized<br>
intradermally as immunomodulatory agent alongwith the HIV-1<br>
subtype C CDA constructs and was found to be 25|xg. Here also<br>
augmentation of immune response was broad based at 6 weeks<br>
post-immunization but declined. However it was detectable<br>
albeit at low levels at 24 weeks post-immunization. In phase IV<br>
study immunomodulation of immune response induced by HIV<br>
vaccinogens injected as prime-boost strategy in mice (priming<br>
with	pJWSK3	(NK29692CO,	NK49426CO)	and<br>
pJWgagprotease49587 (NK49587CO) and boosting two weeks later with MVASK3 (W49426CO) and MVAgagprotease49587 (W49587CO)) with a combination of CpG motif 18260DN and pJWmIL-2/Ig (Interleukin-2) construct was studied. It was observed that the augmentation of both arms of immune response (cell mediated as well as humoral immune response) by CpG motif and pJWmIL2/Ig (Interleukin-2) together was at least twice as much as it was observed with either of the immunomodulators injected with the vaccinogens and lasted even after 24 weeks post-immunization.<br>
These date clearly show that co-immunization mice with immunomodulators (CpG motif and/or murine Interleukin-2 plasmid, pJWmIL2/Ig (interleukin-2) alongwith HIV-1 Indian substype C vaccine constructs induces a robust and an extremely broad based CTL immune response which remains persistently at high levels even at 6 months post-immunization. Since broad based CTL activity is associated with controlling the replication of<br>
virus and also its clearance in those HIV infected individuals, who are long term non-progressors and highly exposed HIV seronegative individuals, I propose that this strategy of co-immunization of HIV infected individuals with immunomodulators like CpG motif (also called ODN or ISS), IL-2 etc. will be able to either control the virus replication to minimal levels or even clear the virus in HIV infected patients.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
