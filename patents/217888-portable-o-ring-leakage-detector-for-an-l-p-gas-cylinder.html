				<td>This invention relates to a PORTABLE '0' RING LEAKAGE DETECTOR FOR AN LP GAS   CYLINDER<br>
'0' Ring is a vital part of an L P Gas Cylinder. The Oil Installations check the L P Gas Cylinders for Pin leakage and 'O' Ring leakage in their Filling Plants by a very sophisticated gadget called the CVT. This gadget cannot be operated without the help of compressed and conditioned air. Hence their checking operation is limited only to the four walls of the Filling Installation.<br>
It is very essential that periodically the 'O' Ring of the L P Gas Cylinder should be checked in the field with the Gas Distributors. In case the 'O' Ring in a Gas Cylinder is leaking, the gas leaks at a very high rate and the Cylinder becomes very hazardous.<br>
The entire L P Gas Industry is feeling the necessity of developing a portable 'O' Ring Leakage Detector for the field. Till today there is no gadget available as prior art that can detect leak in an 'O' Ring fitted in the mouth of the L P Gas Cylinder Valve in the field.<br>
The principal objective of this invention, therefore, is to propose a PORTABLE '0' RING LEAKAGE DETECTOR FOR AN L P GAS CYLINDER which can detect leakage in the 'O' Ring fitted in the mouth of an L P Gas Cylinder any where in the field without the help of compressed - conditioned air.<br>
This invention relates to a PORTABLE 'O' RING LEAKAGE DETECTOR FOR AN L P GAS CYLINDER.<br>
'O' Ring is a vital part of an L P Gas Cylinder. The Oil Installations check the L P Gas Cylinders for Pin leakage and 'O' Ring leakage in their Filling Plants by a very sophisticated gadget called the CVT. This gadget cannot be operated without the help of compressed and conditioned air. Hence their checking operation is limited only to the four walls of the Filling Installation<br>
It is very essential that periodically the 'O' Ring of the Cylinder should be checked in the field with the Gas Distributors. In case the '0' Ring in a Gas Cylinder is leaking, the gas leaks at a very high rate and the Cylinder becomes very hazardous.<br>
The necessity of developing a proper portable 'O' Ring Leakage Detector is felt by the entire L P Gas Industry. Till date no such gadget is available that can effectively check the leakage from the 'O' Ring in an L P Gas Cylinder Valve any where in the field.<br>
The principal objective of this invention, therefore, is to propose a Portable 'O' Ring Leakage Detector for an L P Gas Cylinder Valve which can detect leakage in the 'O' Ring any where in the field without the help of compressed -conditioned air.<br>
The proposed invention is now describe with reference to the accompanying drawings:<br>
A Portable 'O' Ring Leakage Detector for an L P Gas Cylinder Valve which comprises of a body (1) having a stub (2) with a fix pin (3) in the lower part of the said body as an integral part of the said body, the said stub gas tight into the mouth washer (4) of a standard L P Gas Cylinder Valve (5), the said stub pressed down to open the Cylinder Valve Pin (3) by a taper lever (6), the said body provided with a gasket (7) with a hole (8) in the body extending into a rod (9) the lower portion of the said rod (9) screwed gas tight into the said body (1), the rod having a damper mechanism (10) to check the flow of the gas, the said rod (9) surrounded by an inverted tube (11) marked with a water level (12), the lower end of a transparent tube (13) is screwed on to the said body (1) and this said transparent tube (13) holds water for testing the leakage, the upper end of the said transparent tube (13) is screwed on to an upper body (14) having a hole (15) to let the leaking gas escape, the said hole extending to the top of a handle (16) provided at the top of the said upper body (14)<br>
The function and operation of the proposed invention is now described with reference to the accompanying drawing:<br>
OPERATION<br>
Take the lever (6) out from the tester.<br>
Push the stub (2) into the mouth of the L P Gas Cylinder Valve.<br>
Push the lever to full distance in between the tester wall and the bottom of the L P Gas Cylinder Valve Collar.<br>
This will open the Cylinder Valve Pin and full Cylinder pressure will act on the sides of the 'O' Ring located into the mouth of the L P Gas Cylinder Valve.<br>
At this stage in case the '0' Ring of the Cylinder Valve is leaking, the leaking gas will escape from the side of the stub (2), go into the hole (8) and further travel into the rod (9) and passing through the damper will be diverted down in water by the inverted tube (11).<br>
The leaking gas will not escape to the atmosphere since the washer (7) will gas tight the top of the cylinder valve with the tester body.<br>
The leaking gas will bubble through the water and escape through the top hole (15)<br>
Although a specific embodiment of the proposed invention is discussed above, it should be appreciated that many modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. The proposed invention can be applied to so many other equipments such as, all types of L P Gas Leak Detectors, L P Gas Leakage Measurers, PR Testers and the like.<br>
All such modifications to this invention and applications of this invention in other equipments are intended to be included within the scope of this proposed invention, which is limited by the proceeding claims:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I claim:<br>

integral part of the said body, the said stub gas tight into the<br>
mouth washer (4) of a standard L P Gas Cylinder Valve (5),<br>
the said stub pressed down to open the Cylinder Valve Pin (3)<br>
by a taper lever (6), the said body provided with a gasket (7)<br>
with a hole (8) in the body extending into a rod (9) the lower<br>
portion of the said rod (9) screwed gas tight into the said body<br>
(1), the rod having a damper mechanism (10) to check the flow<br>
of the gas, the said rod (9) surrounded by an inverted tube (11)<br>
marked with a water level (12), the lower end of a transparent<br>
tube (13) is screwed on to the said body (1) and this said<br>
transparent tube (13) holds water for testing the leakage, the<br>
upper end of the said transparent tube (13) is screwed on to an<br>
upper body (14) having a hole (15) to let the leaking gas<br>
escape, the said hole extending to the top of a handle (16)<br>
provided at the top of the said upper body (14)<br>
