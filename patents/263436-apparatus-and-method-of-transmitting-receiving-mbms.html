APPARATUS AND METHOD OF TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING<br>
MBMS<br>
TECHNICAL MELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for transmitting and<br>
receiving a multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS), and more particularly, to<br>
an apparatus and method for transmitting and receiving an MBMS using Automatic<br>
Repeat Request (ARC) and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ). Although the<br>
present invention is suitable for a wide scope of applications, it is particularly suitable<br>
for providing a multicast transmission using adaptive modulation and channel coding<br>
and Hybrid ARQ to a wireless mobile user equipment to enable the user equipment to<br>
receive high-speed multicast data.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
FIO. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a network structure of UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications System). A UMTS includes user equipment (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated UE), a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (hereinafter abbreviated<br>
UTRAN), and a core network (hereinafter abbreviated CN).<br>
The UTRAN includes at least one radio network sub-system (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated ENS). The RNS includes one radio network controller (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated RNC) and at least one base station (hereinafter called Node B) managed by<br>
the RNC. At least one or more cells exist in one Node B.<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
2<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an architectural diagram of a radio interface protocol between<br>
one UE and a UTRAN. A radio interface protocol vertically includes a physical layer, a<br>
data link layer, and a network layer and horizontally includes a user plane for data<br>
information transfer and a control plane for signaling transfer. The protocol layers in<br>
FIQ. 2 can be divided into LI (first layer), L2 (second layer) and L3 (third layer) based<br>
on three lower layers of the open system interconnection (OS!) standard model widely<br>
known in the communications systems.<br>
The physical layer (hereinafter named PHY) offers information transfer<br>
services to an upper layer using physical channels. The physical layer is connected to a<br>
medium access control (hereinafter abbreviated MAC) layer above the physical layer<br>
via transport channels. Data are transferred between the MAC layer and the PHY layer<br>
via a transport channel. Data are transferred between different physical layers, and more<br>
specifically, between one physical layer of a transmitting side and the other physical<br>
layer of a receiving side via physical channels.<br>
The MAC layer of the second layer offers services to a radio link control layer<br>
above the MAC layer via logical channels. The radio link control (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated RLC) layer of the second layer supports reliable data transfer and performs<br>
segmentation and concatenation of RLC service data units (hereinafter abbreviated<br>
SDU) sent down from an upper layer.<br>
A radio resource control (hereinafter abbreviated RRC) layer located on a<br>
lowest part of the third layer is defined in the control plane only and is associated with<br>
configuration, reconfiguration and release of radio bearers (hereinafter abbreviated RB)<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
3<br>
for controlling the logical, transport and physical channels. A KB is a service offered to<br>
the second layer for the data transfer between the UE and the UTRAN. The<br>
configuration of a RB is a process of regulating characteristics of protocol layers and<br>
channels necessary for offering a specific service and a process of setting their specific<br>
parameters and operational methods, respectively.<br>
A multimedia broadcast/multicast service (hereinafter abbreviated MBMS)<br>
offers a streaming or background service to a plurality of UEs using a downlink<br>
dedicated MBMS bearer service. One MBMS includes at least one session, and MBMS<br>
data are transmitted to a plurality of the UEs via the MBMS bearer service only during<br>
an ongoing session.<br>
A UTRAN offers the MBMS bearer service to a UE via a radio bearer. The<br>
types of RB used by the UTRAN include a point-to-point radio bearer and a point-to-<br>
multipoint radio bearer. A point-to-point radio bearer is a bi-directional radio bearer and<br>
includes a logical channel DTCH (dedicated traffic channel), a transport channel DCH<br>
(dedicated channel) and a physical channel DPCH (dedicated physical channel) or a<br>
physical channel SCCPCH (secondary common control physical channel). A point-to-<br>
multipoint radio bearer is a unidirectional downlink radio bearer.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates channel mapping for MBMS. A point-to-multipoint radio<br>
bearer includes a logical channel MTCH (MBMS traffic channel), a transport channel<br>
FACH (forward access channel) and a physical channel SCCPCH. The logical channel<br>
MTCH is configured for each MBMS offered to one cell and is used in transmitting<br>
user-plane data of a specific MBMS to a plurality of UEs.<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
4<br>
A logical channel MCCH (MBMS control channel) is a point-to-multipoint<br>
downlink channel used in transmitting control information associated with the MBMS.<br>
The logical channel MCCH is mapped to the transport channel FACH (forward access<br>
channel), while the transport channel FACH is mapped to the physical channel<br>
SCCPCH (secondary common control physical channel). One MCCH exists within one<br>
cell.<br>
The UTRAN offering the MBMS transmits MCCH information to a plurality<br>
of UEs via the MCCH. The MCCH information includes a notification message<br>
associated with the MBMS, for example, an RRC message associated with the MBMS.<br>
The MCCH information may include a message that indicates MBMS information,, a<br>
message that notifies point-to-multipoint radio bearer information or access information<br>
indicating that an RRC connection is requested for a specific MBMS.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a transmission system of MCCH information. The MCCH<br>
information is periodically transmitted according to a modification period and a<br>
repetition period.<br>
The MCCH information is divided into critical information and non-critical<br>
information. The non-critical information can be freely modified each modification<br>
period or each repetition period. The modification of the critical information can be<br>
made only each modification period. Specifically, the critical information is repeated<br>
one time each repetition period and the transmission of the modified critical information<br>
is possible at a start point of the modification period only.<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
5<br>
The UTRAN periodically transmits a physical channel MICH (MBMS<br>
notification indicator channel) to indicate whether the MCCH information is updated<br>
during the modification period. Therefore, a UE attempting to receive only one specific<br>
MBMS does not receive the MCCH or MTCH until a session of the service begins, but<br>
receives MICH (MBMS notification indicator channel) periodically. For reference, the<br>
update of the MCCH information means a generation, addition, modification or removal<br>
of a specific item of the MCCH information.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a flowchart of a process for executing an MBMS according to<br>
the related art. Once a session of a specific MBMS begins (S51), a UTRAN transmits<br>
an NI (notification indicator) to a UE attempting to receive a specific MBMS (S52).<br>
The NI indicates that an MCCH channel should be received. The UE, having received<br>
the NI via an MICH, receives an MCCH for a specific modification period indicated by<br>
the MICH.<br>
A UE attempting to receive a specific MBMS using a point-to-multipoint radio<br>
bearer receives MCCH information including radio bearer information via an MCCH<br>
and then configures the point-to-multipoint radio bearer using the received information<br>
(S53). After completion of configuring the point-to-multipoint radio bearer, the UE<br>
keeps receiving a physical channel SCCPCH, to which an MTCH is mapped, in order to<br>
acquire data of the specific MBMS transmitted via the MTCH (SS4). If a session ends<br>
(S55), the configured point-to-multipoint radio bearer is released (S56).<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a method of transmitting MBMS data discontinuously via<br>
MTCH. A UTRAN periodically transmits a scheduling message to a UE via an<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
6<br>
SCCPCH (SCCPH carrying MTCH) to which an MTCH is mapped. The scheduling<br>
message indicates a transmission start point and transmission section of MBMS data<br>
transmitted during one scheduling period. The UTRAN should previously inform the<br>
UE of a transmission period (scheduling period) of scheduling information.<br>
The UE acquires the scheduling period from the UTRAN, receives the<br>
scheduling message periodically according to the acquired scheduling period, and then<br>
receives the SCCPCH (SCCPH carrying MTCH) to which the MTCH is mapped. The<br>
SCCPCH is received discontinuously and periodically using the received scheduling<br>
message. Specifically, the UE, using the scheduling message, receives the SCCPCH<br>
carrying the MTCH during a timing section for which the data is transmitted hut does<br>
not receive the SCCPCH carrying the MTCH during a time section for which the data is<br>
not transmitted. The method is advantageous in that the UE can efficiently receive the<br>
data to reduce its battery consumption.<br>
An HS-DSCH transmission of transmitting high-speed data in downlink to one<br>
UE is explained as follows.<br>
An HS-DSCH has a 2ms transmission time interval (hereinafter abbreviated<br>
TTI) (3 slot) and supports various modulation code sets (hereinafter abbreviated MCSs)<br>
for a high data rate. By selecting an MCS most suitable for a channel status, an optimal<br>
throughput is provided. HARQ is adopted to enable a reliable transmission. HARQ<br>
involves combining ARQ and channel coding.<br>
FIO. 7 illustrates an HS-DSCH protocol stack according to the related art A<br>
data unit delivered from an RLC layer of a serving radio network controller (hereinafter<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
7<br>
abbreviated SRNC) is delivered to an MAC-d entity managing a dedicated channel via a<br>
logical channel DTCH (dedicated traffic channel) or DCCH (dedicated control channel).<br>
The data unit is then passed through a MAC-c/sh/m of a controlling radio network<br>
controller (hereinafter abbreviated CRNC) to deliver the corresponding data to a MAC-<br>
hs of a Node B. The MAC-d is an entity that manages the dedicated channel. The<br>
MAC-c/sh/m is an entity that manages a common channel. The MAC-hs is a MAC<br>
entity that manages the HS-DSCH.<br>
A physical channel HS-PDSCH is used for delivering the HS-DSCH, which is<br>
a transport channel. A spreading factor of the HS-PDSCH is fixed at 16 and the HS-<br>
PDSCH corresponds to one channelization code selected from a channelization code set<br>
prepared for a HS-DSCH data transmission. When performing a multi-code<br>
transmission for one UE, a plurality of channelization codes are assigned during the<br>
same HS-PDSCH sub-frame.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a HS-DSCH sub-frame and slot according to the related art.<br>
A HS-PDSCH transfers QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) or 16-QAM<br>
(Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulation symbols. In FIG. 8, "M" designates a<br>
bit number per modulation symbol. For QPSK, "M" is equal to 2 (M=2) and for 16-<br>
QAM, "M" is equal to 4 (M=4).<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a channel configuration according to the related art A<br>
transmission of HS-DSCH control information is needed to transfer user data via an HS-<br>
DSCH. The information is transmitted via a downlink high-speed shared control<br>
channel (HS-SCCH) and a downlink high speed dedicated physical control channel<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
8<br>
(HS-DPCCH). A DPCH (dedicated physical channel) is a bi-directional physical<br>
channel to which a transport channel DCH is mapped. The DPCH is used to deliver<br>
dedicated data of a UE and LI control information dedicated to a UE, such as a power<br>
control signal necessary for closed loop power control.<br>
An F-DPCH (fractional dedicated physical channel) is a downlink channel for<br>
transferring several DPCHs using one channelization code. One F-DPCH does not<br>
transfer UE dedicated data for several UEs but rather is used to transfer UE-dedicated<br>
LI control information for several UEs, such as the power control signal necessary for<br>
the closed loop power control. If the downlink F-DPCH exists, the downlink F-DPCH<br>
interfaces with an uplink DPCH. A plurality of UEs share the F-DPCH for use via one<br>
channel code. Each of the UEs is provided with an uplink DPCH.<br>
FIG. 10 is a structural diagram of a sub-frame of HS-PDSCH according to the<br>
related art A downlink HS-SCCH is a downlink physical channel transferred with a<br>
spreading factor set to 128 such that the data rate is 60 kbps. Information transferred<br>
over the downlink HS-SCCH can be classified into transport format and resource related<br>
information (hereinafter abbreviated TFR1) and HARQ related information. UE identity<br>
(H-KNTI) information, which indicates to which user the corresponding information<br>
belongs, is masked for transfer.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart of an HS-SCCH coding method according to the related<br>
art. HS-SCCH information for HS-SCCH coding is illustrated in Table TBD. HARQ<br>
and UE ID information is illustrated in Table EL.<br><br>

FIG. 12 is a structural diagram of a frame of uplink HS-DPCCH according to<br>
the related art. An uplink HS-DPCCH transfers uplink feedback signaling associated<br>
with a downlink HS-DSCH data transmission.<br>
The HS-DPCCH is a channel dedicated to a specific UE and interfaces with an<br>
uplink DPCH (dedicated physical channel) and a downlink DPCH (dedicated physical<br>
channel). The feedback signaling includes ACK (acknowledgement) or NACK<br>
(negative acknowledgement) infonnation for HARQ and a CQI (channel quality<br>
indicator). A frame of the HS-DPCCH includes five sub-frames, each of which has a<br>
length of 2ms. Each of the sub-frames includes three slots.<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
10<br>
The ACK/NACK information for HARQ is transmitted for a first slot of the<br>
HS-DPCCH sub-frame. The CQI is transmitted for second and third slots of the HS-<br>
DSCH sub-frame.<br>
The HS-DPCCH is always transmitted together with UL PDCCH. The CQI<br>
delivers status infonnation of a downlink radio channel. The status information is<br>
obtained from a measurement of a downlink CPICH (common pilot channel) by a UE.<br>
The ACK/NACK indicates the ACK or NACK information for a user data packet<br>
transmission transmitted over a downlink HS-DSCH by the HARQ mechanism.<br>
However, related art methods provide a maximum data rate for MBMS of only<br>
256 Kbps, which corresponds to a maximum speed of one SCCPCH. Therefore, the<br>
related art methods are unable to provide an MBMS having a data rate greater than 256<br>
Kbps. Furthermore, since an uplink channel for the MBMS is not provided, related art<br>
systems are unable to deliver information (ACK or NACK) in response to the MBMS<br>
transmission.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an apparatus and method to provide MBMS at a<br>
data rate greater than 256 Kbps and allow ACK/NACK information to be provided in<br>
response to the MBMS transmission. The present invention addresses these and other<br>
needs.<br><br>

DFTAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for transmitting and<br>
receiving MBMS information. Although the present invention is illustrated with respect<br>
to a mobile communication device, it is contemplated that the present invention may be<br>
utilized anytime it is desired to transmit a service to one or more users.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to<br>
refer to the same or like parts.<br>
FIG 13 is a diagram illustrating an example of a data transmission via HS-<br>
SCCH and HS-PDSCH. The HS-PDSCH (high speed-physical downlink shared<br>
channel) can transmit a UE dedicated data unit for a specific UE or a multicast data unit<br>
for one or more UEs subscribed to a specific multicast service for each sub-frame. The<br>
UE dedicated data unit is a logical channel DTCH or DCCH data unit and the multicast<br>
data unit is a logical channel MTCH, MCCH or MSCH data unit.<br>
If the UB dedicated data unit is transmitted for the HS-PDSCH sub-frame, a<br>
mapped HS-SCCH sub-frame transmits a UE identity allocated to the UE. If the<br>
multicast data unit is transmitted for the HS-PDSCH sub-frame, the mapped HS-SCCH<br>
sub-frame transmits an MBMS identity allocated to the multicast service.<br><br>

Referring to FIG 13, an MBMS identity is an identity of a specific MBMS<br>
allocated by a CN or an RRC of a UTRAN. The MBMS identity is an MBMS<br>
transmission identity or an MBMS-Id.<br>
The MBMS identity is an identity allocated by the CN to identify a specific<br>
MBMS. The MBMS transmission identity includes an MBMS identity and an MBMS<br>
session identity.<br>
The MBMS session identity is an identity that identifies a specific session of a<br>
specific MBMS. The MBMS-id is a service identity allocated by the UTRAN and is an<br>
MBMS identity included in a MAC header of an MTCH.<br>
The MBMS identity can be replaced by a UB group identity. The UE group<br>
identity is an identity that identifies a UB group consisting of one or more UEs<br>
attempting to receive the same data.<br>

An MBMS identity or UE identity, as shown in FIG 14, is encoded in a CRC<br>
(Cyclic Redundancy Check) attachment and masking is according to a type of data to be<br>
transmitted. A UE attempting to receive multicast data via HS-DSCH should be<br>
provided with both the UE identity and the MBMS identity.<br>
FIG 15 illustrates a flowchart of UE operation according to HS-SCCH and<br>
HS-PDSCH transmission. A UE stores its UE identity. If there is at least one service<br>
that the UE attempts to receive, the UE also stores the MBMS identities corresponding<br>
to the services (SI51). The UE receives an HS-SCCH (SI52) and acquires identity<br>
information from a sub-frame of the received HS-SCCH (SI 53). The UE checks<br>
whether the acquired identity is identical to the UE or MBMS identity it has stored.<br>
If there is no match, the UE again receives the next HS-SCCH (S152) and re-<br>
acquires identity information from a sub-frame of the received HS-SCCH (S153). If<br>
there is a match, the UE receives an HS-PDSCH sub-frame mapped to the sub-frame of<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
20<br>
the received HS-SCCH (SI54). The UE transmits a response signal to indicate the<br>
reception of the HS-PDSCH sub-frame either without errors (ACK) or with errors<br>
(NACK)(S155).<br>
FIG 16 illustrates an HS-DSCH transmission according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. A multicast transmission via HS-PDSCH according to the present<br>
invention is explained according to FIG 16.<br>
The HS-PDSCH transmits UE dedicated data for a specific UE or multicast<br>
data for one or more UEs subscribed to a specific multicast service for each sub-frame.<br>
A UE then transmits a signal in response to the data transmissions via a sub-frame of an<br>
HS-DPCCH mapped to the HS-PDSCH sub-frame. Each of the sub-frames delivers a<br>
response signal for the UE dedicated data or for the multicast data according to a type of<br>
the received data. The response signal is ACK or NACK.<br>
Upon decoding the received data, an ACK response is transmitted if the data is<br>
received without error. If an error occurs, an NACK response is transmitted. The sub-<br>
frame of the HS-DPCCH can transmit CQI (channel quality indicator) information<br>
together with the ACK or NACK signal.<br>
FIG 17 illustrates a flowchart of a multicast retransmission method according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention. Each of a plurality of UEs (UE#1, UE#2)<br>
attempting to receive a specific MBMS receives an HS-SCCH sub-frame in order to<br>
acquire an MBMS identity (S171). If the acquired identity is the MBMS corresponds to<br>
a service to which a UE has subscribed, the UE receives a corresponding HS-PDSCH<br>
sub-frame to acquire multicast data (SI72).<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
21<br>
A first UE (UE #1) transmits ACK or NACK information for the received<br>
multicast data via HS-DPCCH after receiving the HS-PDSCH sub-frame (S173). The<br>
first UE (UE #1) can periodically transmit CQI information. As illustrated in FIG 17,<br>
NACK information is transmitted since errors occur in the received data.<br>
A second UE (UE #2) transmits ACK or NACK information for the received<br>
multicast data via HS-DPCCH after receiving the HS-PDSCH sub-frame (S174). The<br>
second UE (UE #2) can periodically transmit CQI information. As illustrated in FIG 17,<br>
NACK information is transmitted since errors occur in the received data.<br>
If a number of UEs exceeding a threshold value transmit NACK, a Node B<br>
retransmits the data to a plurality of UEs using an MBMS identity and then retransmits<br>
the MBMS identity via the HS-SCCH (S17S). Each of the plurality of UEs receives the<br>
HS-SCCH sub-frame and acquires the MBMS identity. If the acquired MBMS identity<br>
corresponds to a service to which a UE has subscribed, the UE receives the<br>
corresponding HS-PDSCH sub-frame (S176) to acquire the multicast data.<br>
The first UE (UE #1) transmits ACK or NACK information for the received<br>
multicast data via the HS-DPCCH after receiving the HS-PDSCH sub-frame (S177).<br>
The first UE (UE #1) can periodically transmit CQI information. As illustrated in FIG<br>
17, NACK information is transmitted since errors occur in the received data.<br>
The second UE (UE #2) transmits ACK or NACK information for the received<br>
multicast data via HS-DPCCH after receiving the HS-PDSCH sub-frame (S178). The<br>
second UE (UE #2) can periodically transmit CQI information. As illustrated in FIG 17,<br>
ACK information is transmitted since no errors occur in the received data.<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
22<br>
If a number of UEs not exceeding the threshold value have transmitted NACK,<br>
the Node B retransmits the data unit to only the UE(s) that failed to receive the data unit<br>
without errors. The Node B also transmits an identity of each of the UEs that failed to<br>
receive the data unit without errors over a different HS-SCCH sub-frame.<br>
The UEs corresponding to the transmitted identities receive the HS-SCCH sub-<br>
frame and acquire the UE identity (S179). For a specific UE, if the acquired identity<br>
corresponds to the UE's identity, the UE receives the corresponding HS-PDSCH sub-<br>
frame and acquires the multicast data (SI 80) and, if the acquired identity does not<br>
correspond to the UE's identity, the UE does not receive the corresponding HS-PDSCH<br>
sub-frame.<br>
The first UE (UE #1) transmits ACK or NACK information for the received<br>
multicast data via the HS-DPCCH after receiving the HS-PDSCH sub-frame (S181).<br>
The first UE (UE #1) can periodically transmit CQI information. As illustrated in FIG<br>
17, ACK information is transmitted since no errors occur hi the received data.<br>
FIG 18 illustrates a channel for a multicast data transmission according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. An F-DPCH is shared by a plurality of UEs<br>
having subscribed to a multicast service in order to transmit UE dedicated power control<br>
signals. The F-DPCH interfaces with several uplink DPCHs set for each of the UEs in<br>
order to perform the power control. As illustrated hi FIG 18, power of HS-DPCCH is<br>
adjusted according to the uplink DPCH.<br>
FIG 19 illustrates an HS-DSCH protocol stack according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. A channel associated with an MBMS, such as MTCH, MSCH<br><br>
WO 2006/088301	PCT/KR2006/000502<br>
23<br>
or MCCH, is mapped to an HS-DSCH in a CRNC so that MBMS control information or<br>
MBMS data can be transmitted to a UE via an HS-PDSCH.<br>
FIG 20 illustrates an MAC PDU (protocol datavinit) of HS-DSCH according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention. A MAC-hs SDU (service data unit)<br>
corresponds to a MAC-c/sh/m PDU.<br>
For an MTCH, the MAC-c/sh/m PDU includes a TCTF (target channel type<br>
field), an MBMS-ld and a MAC SDU or includes only a MAC SDU. For an MCCH or<br>
MSCH, the MAC-c/sh/m PDU includes a TCTF and a MAC SDU or includes only a<br>
MAC SDU.<br>
The MAC SDU corresponds to an RLC PDU. A first bit of VF is set to 0 for a<br>
DTCH/DCCH transmission or to 1 for an MTCH/MCCH/MSCH transmission. The VF<br>
can be set to 1-bit or 2-bit. If the first bit of the VF is set to 1, a UE MAC recognizes<br>
the MAC PDU as multicast data that is delivered to an upper RLC via 1he MTCH,<br>
MCCH or MSCH.<br>
FIG 21 illustrates a MAC of a UTRAN according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. For an MTCH in a MAC-c/sh/m, an MBMS-ld or a TCTF can be<br>
attached to a MAC SDU. For an MCCH or MSCH, a TCTF can be attached to the<br>
MAC SDU.<br>
FIG 22 illustrates a MAC of a UE according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. For an MTCH in a MAC-c/sh/m, an MBMS-ID or a TCTF can be separated<br>
from a MAC PDU. For an MCCH or MSCH, the TCTF can be separated from the MAC<br>
PDU.<br><br>

FIG 23 illustrates an MBMS channel determination process according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A UE receives an MBMS service information<br>
message via an MCCH. The UE receives information commanding the UE to receive<br>
an access information message together with an MBMS transmission identity of a<br>
service to which the UE has subscribed using the MBMS information message (S231).<br>
The UE receives the access information message to perform an RRC<br>
connection procedure using a probability factor included in the received message (S232)<br>
and then performs the RRC connection procedure (S233). During the RRC connection<br>
procedure, the UE informs a UTRAN whether it is able to receive the MBMS via an<br>
HS-DSCH.<br>
Via an MCCH, the UTRAN provides the MBMS via the HS-DSCH. The<br>
UTRAN indicates that the MBMS shall be provided via the HS-DSCH (S234). In order<br>
to indicate that the MBMS is to be provided, an MBMS transmission identity of the<br>
service and HS-DSCH information for the service are sent via the MCCH. The identity<br>
and the information are transmitted via the MBMS service information message.<br>
FIG 24 illustrates a process for establishing an MBMS channel according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. A UTRAN indicates, via an MCCH, mat an<br>
MBMS shall be provided via an HS-DSCH (S241). In order to indicate that the MBMS<br>
is to be provided, an MBMS transmission identity of the service and HS-DSCH<br>
information for the service are sent via the MCCH. The identity and the information are<br>
transmitted via an MBMS service information message.<br><br>

AUE, among a plurality of UBs capable of receiving the service via the HS-<br>
DSCH, that has not completed an KRC connection, carries out the RRC connection<br>
(S242). During the RRC connection procedure, the UB informs a UTRAN whether it is<br>
able to receive the MBMS via the HS-DSCH.<br>
The UTRAN carries out an RB setup procedure for the UE capable of<br>
receiving the MBMS via the HS-DSCH (S243). Through this procedure, the HS-DSCH<br>
is established in the UE and the UTRAN transmits MBMS data via the established HS-<br>
DSCH (S244). The data transmission is carried out using, for example, the HS-SCCH,<br>
HS-DPCCH or F-DPCH.<br>

apparatus according to the present invention includes an antenna unit 251, an RP (radio<br>
frequency) unit 252, a signal processing unit 253 and a memory unit 254. The signal<br>
processing unit 253 includes a processing unit such as a microprocessor and a digital<br>
processor. The radio communication apparatus according to the present invention<br>
further includes a display unit 255 for displaying specific information on a screen, a<br>
keypad unit 256 for receiving a signal from a user, and a speaker unit 257 for outputting<br>
a sound signal.<br>
A UE identity and a multicast service identity are received via the antenna unit<br>
251 and the RF unit 252. The signal processing unit 253 compares UB and multicast<br>
service identities previously stored in the UE to the received UB and multioast service<br>
identities, respectively.<br><br>

If either the received UE or multicast service identity matches the stored UE or<br>
multicast service identity, a frame of a data corresponding to a specific frame of a<br>
control channel is received via the antenna and RF units 251 and 252. The signal<br>
processing unit 253 decodes the received frame of data and transmits control<br>
information including an ACK/NACK response signal according to the decoding result<br>
and a CQI via the antenna unit 251 and RF unit 252.<br>
The above-described embodiments of the present invention are explained<br>
based on a cellular mobile communication network. Yet, the technical features of the<br>
present invention are not limited to the cellular mobile communication network and are<br>
