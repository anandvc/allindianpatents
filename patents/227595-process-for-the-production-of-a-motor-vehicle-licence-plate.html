				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A MOTOR VEHICLE LICENCE PLATE<br>
The present invention concerns a process for the production of a plate, in particular a motor<br>
vehicle licence plate and plates produced in accordance with that process.<br>
Reflective plates, in particular motor vehicle licence plates, are known from the state of the<br>
art, the reflectance of which is based on a reflection film being glued or laminated on to a carrier<br>
which for example comprises sheet aluminium. In that situation it is necessary to use reflection films<br>
whose reflectance is within a range which is fixed by statute and which establishes that the<br>
reflectance may not fall below a minimum value of that range or exceed a maximum value thereof.<br>
Commercially available films which satisfy those conditions include a carrier layer which frequently<br>
comprises aluminium and which is impenetrable for light.<br>
If now the attempt is made to produce a plate, in particular a motor vehicle licence plate,<br>
which is self-illuminating by virtue of the fact that, on one of its flat sides, it has a layer sequence<br>
which forms an electroluminescence flat capacitor and which is constructed directly on the plate<br>
itself, then in accordance with the state of the art such a plate cannot be at the same time designed to<br>
be reflective. More specifically, if the layer sequence of the flat capacitor is firstly applied to the<br>
carrier, it cannot then be covered over with the above-mentioned reflection films as the carrier<br>
thereof does not transmit the light which it emits.<br>
If conversely the attempt is made to apply a surface-covering electroluminescence flat<br>
capacitor arrangement to the top side of a reflection film applied to the plate carrier, the reflection<br>
properties thereof become ineffective as at least some of the flat capacitor layers are impenetrable in<br>
both directions in relation to external light.<br>
Admittedly transparent reflection films are also available on the market, but they have a<br>
reflectance which is substantially higher than the above-mentioned maximum value which is<br>
permitted by statute.<br><br>
From WO 02/23509 a licence plate is known which comprises a electroluminescence film as<br>
well as a reflection film which, as seen by a person viewing said plate from the front side, is arranged<br>
in front of said electroluminescence film. By the application of a pattern the reflectance of said<br>
reflection film is to be adjusted to a desired value so that the statutory requirements may be perfectly<br>
satisfied. This document, however, neither explains the actual meaning of the term "application of a<br>
pattern" nor provides it a technical teaching which could be followed in order to perform such<br>
application of a pattern.<br>
In comparison therewith the object of the present invention is to provide a process of the kind<br>
set forth in the opening part of this specification, which makes it possible easily and inexpensively to<br>
produce plates, in particular motor vehicle licence plates, which have a reflectance complying with<br>
the statutory requirements and which at the same time carry an electroluminescence flat capacitor<br>
which covers at least the major part of the flat side thereof and which imparts self-illuminating<br>
properties thereto.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of a plate, in<br>
particular a motor vehicle licence plate, in which initially at least one layer sequence forming an<br>
electroluminescence flat capacitor and thereafter a reflection film are applied to a carrier, wherein<br>
the reflection value of the reflection film is higher than the maximum statutory permissible value,<br>
and said reflection value is reduced by further production steps to such an extent that it is below the<br>
maximum statutory permissible value, characterised in that the reflection film has a layer which is<br>
opaque in relation to the light of the electroluminescence flat capacitor and that the further<br>
production steps involve providing the reflection film with a grid raster of holes in which the size and<br>
surface density of the holes are so selected that on the one hand the reflection value of the reflection<br>
film averaged in relation to surface area comes to lie below the maximum value permitted by statute<br>
and on the other hand the brightness of the light passing through the openings from the<br>
electroluminescence flat capacitor averaged over the surface area exceeds the minimum value<br>
prescribed by statute.<br>
The invention further provides a plate, in particular a motor vehicle licence plate, which<br>
includes a carrier, a reflection film and at least one layer sequence which as seen from the viewer is<br>
disposed behind the reflection film and which forms an electroluminescence flat capacitor, wherein<br>
the reflectance of the reflection film, which is originally above the maximum value permitted by<br><br><br>
statute, has been reduced in the course of the plate production process, characterised in that the<br>
reflection film has a layer which is opaque for the light of the electroluminescence flat capacitor, and<br>
that provided in the reflection film is a grid raster of holes, the holes of which extend through all<br>
layers of the reflection film and the size and surface density thereof being so selected that the<br>
reflectance of the reflection film, which results after application of the grid raster of holes, is below<br>
the maximum value permitted by statute.<br>
Those measures are based on the consideration that it is possible to apply both a layer<br>
sequence forming an electroluminescence flat or surface capacitor and also a reflective film to one<br>
and the same side of the carrier, if a reflection film is used, whose reflectance is initially higher than a<br>
desired maximum value, which, for example corresponds to a maximum value permitted by statute,<br>
but that reflection foil is subjected to at least one manufacturing step which at least in location-wise<br>
manner reduces its reflectance to such an extent as to afford an average value which is below said<br>
desired value.<br>
Basically, two different operating procedures are possible.<br>
In one procedure, the reflective foil is applied to the carrier of the plate and, on the front side<br>
of said film which faces towards the person viewing it, there is constructed a rastered flat capacitor<br>
arrangement, the size and the surface density of the electrically conductingly interconnected raster<br>
points which are impermeable to external light being so selected that they cover a sufficient area of<br>
the reflection film to reduce the mean reflection value thereof to below the desired maximum value<br>
and at the same time form a sufficiently large area which lights up in operation so that the brightness<br>
of that self-illuminating plate exceeds a desired minimal value which may be defined by statutory<br>
requirements. It has surprisingly been found that such a choice in terms of size and surface density is<br>
possible. With this variant it is immaterial whether the reflection film has an opaque carrier layer or<br>
not.<br>
In a more greatly preferred variant, firstly the layer sequence forming the flat capacitor is built<br>
up on the carrier of the plate and then covered over with a reflection film which from the outset is<br>
transparent or is made transparent in a location-wise manner, for the light emitted in operation by the<br>
flat capacitor.<br><br><br>
In order to reduce the initially very high reflection value of such a film to bring it into the<br>
desired range, a plurality of different process steps which are independent of each other or which can<br>
be used in conjunction with each other are available in accordance with the invention.<br>
An advantageous possibility, involves applying a reflection film which is not transmissive in<br>
respect of the light of the electroluminescence flat capacitor on or over the electroluminescence flat<br>
capacitor which reflection film is provided with a raster pattern of holes in which the size and surface<br>
density of the through holes are so selected that the reduction implemented thereby in respect of the<br>
reflection value which is averaged in relation to surface area reduces same to below the desired<br>
maximum value and at the same time affords adequate options for transmission of the light emitted<br>
by the flat capacitor in operation, so that the brightness thereof exceeds a desired minimal value.<br>
In accordance with a particularly preferred mode of operation, a transparent reflection film, at<br>
the rear side of which prismatic structures freely project, at the interfaces of which the light incident<br>
from the front side is reflected by total reflection, is so connected to a layer which is applied to the<br>
top side of the flat capacitor and which comprises an adhesive for the reflection film and which<br>
involves approximately the same refractive index as the prismatic structures of the reflection film,<br>
that the free spaces present between the projecting prismatic structures are at least partially filled by<br>
said layer. No further total reflection can then occur at all the interfaces of the prismatic structures<br>
which are covered by that layer. By virtue of the fact that not all interfaces of the prismatic structure<br>
are brought into contact with that layer, there is still a reflectance - although reduced - which can be<br>
controlled within wide limits and in particular in such a way that the desired maximum value is not<br>
exceeded any more, by virtue of the extent to which the prismatic structures are covered by the<br>
above-mentioned layer.<br>
That extent can be specifically and targetedly influenced by virtue of the production process<br>
being of a suitable nature.<br>
In accordance with another preferred process, a transparent reflection film is tempered, that is<br>
to say heated, either prior to or during the application to the uppermost layer of the flat capacitor or a<br>
transparent layer disposed thereover, and / or is pressed against a hard flat surface in such a way that<br>
the prismatic structures projecting at the rear side thereof are flattened off and thus there is a<br><br><br>
reduction in the surface regions of said structures, which implement total reflection. By virtue of<br>
suitable selection of the temperature and / or the pressing pressure as well as the treatment time, it is<br>
in turn possible to reduce the reflectance of the reflection film to such an extent that it is in the<br>
desired range.<br>
The features of plates which are produced in accordance with one of the processes of the<br>
invention are described in detail hereinafter.<br>
The invention is described hereinafter by means of embodiments by way of example with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawing in which :<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic cross-section through a first embodiment of a plate according<br>
to the invention in which the degree of reflection of a transparent reflection film is reduced by<br>
partially immersing the prismatic structures projecting on the rear side in an adhesive layer having<br>
the same refractive index,<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic cross-section through a second embodiment of a plate<br>
according to the invention in which the degree of reflection of a transparent reflection film is reduced<br>
by completely immersing the prismatic structures projecting on the rear side in an<br><br>
adhesive layer which is only partially applied to the surface of the plate and<br>
having the same refractive index,<br>
Figure 3 shows a diagrammatic cross-section through a third<br>
embodiment of a plate according to the invention in which the degree of<br>
reflection of a reflection film having a non-transparent carrier is reduced by<br>
applying a grid raster of holes which pass through to the<br>
electroluminescence flat capacitor, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a diagrammatic cross-section through a fourth<br>
embodiment of a plate according to the invention in which the degree of<br>
reflection of a transparent reflection film is reduced by flattening or<br>
rounding of the prismatic structures projecting on the rear side.<br>
In all illustrated embodiments the thicknesses of the individual layers<br>
are not shown true to scale and in part, for the sake of simplicity, are<br>
illustrated on a greatly enlarged scale. The prismatic structures which<br>
project from the rear side of the reflection film or which are embedded into<br>
the reflection film and at the interfaces of which reflection of the light<br>
incident from the front, that is to say from above in the Figures, are shown<br>
in greatly simplified form as rearwardly projecting prisms of triangular or<br>
trapezoidal cross-section.<br>
In the lower region all illustrated embodiments involve the same<br>
layer structure. Those layers which are the same in all of Figures 1 through<br>
4 are denoted by the same references.<br>
The basis of each plate is formed by a deformable carrier 1 which<br>
can comprise a plastically deformable plastic material or metal, for example<br>
aluminum. In the latter case the carrier 1 is preferably completely covered<br>
over by an insulating layer 2 which on its top side carries a metal coating<br>
which is a good electrical conductor, for example of copper, and out of<br>
which are etched various conducting regions of which the Figures show in<br>
cross-section only the region forming the base electrode 4 of the<br>
electroluminescence flat capacitor described hereinafter. If a plurality of<br>
mutually juxtaposed, separately actuable flat capacitors are to be provided<br>
on the plate, then a plurality of mutually electrically insulated base<br>
electrodes with their respective actuating lines can also be etched out of<br><br><br>
the metal coating. In addition, a feed-in line (not shown) for the<br>
transparent cover electrode of the flat capacitor or capacitors, said<br>
electrode being described in greater detail hereinafter, is also<br>
advantageously etched out of the metal coating in such a way that it is<br>
electrically insulated from the base electrode or electrodes and the<br>
actuating lines thereof.<br>
Disposed over the metal coating is an insulating layer 5 which covers<br>
the entire surface of the base electrode 4 and which is preferably colored<br>
with a light pigment so that the light which is emitted rearwardly, that is to<br>
say downwardly in the Figures, by the pigment layer 6 disposed thereabove<br>
in operation of the flat capacitor is radiated as completely as possible<br>
forwardly. Disposed over the pigment layer is a transparent, extremely thin<br>
cover electrode 7 which however is a good electrical conductor and which,<br>
in at least one edge region (not shown in the Figures) in which the<br>
insulating layer 5 and the pigment layer 6 are omitted, is in good<br>
electrically conducting contact with the feed-in line which is produced from<br>
the metal coating so that an ac voltage can be applied by way of that feed-<br>
in line to the cover electrode 7 in relation to the base electrode 4, by virtue<br>
of which voltage the doped pigments contained in the pigment layer 6 are<br>
excited in known manner to produce a light referred to as<br>
electroluminescence.<br>
The structures described hereinbefore can be produced by a<br>
procedure whereby a commercially available film which forms the insulating<br>
layer 2 and which is provided on its underside with an adhesive layer (not<br>
shown) and which on its top side carries the metal coating is glued or<br>
laminated on to the carrier 1. The operation of etching out the various,<br>
electrically mutually separated line and electrode regions can be effected as<br>
required prior to or after that operation of applying the plastic film to the<br>
carrier 1. The further layers 4 through 7 of the flat capacitor can be applied<br>
by known coating processes (spraying, screen printing, thick layer or other<br>
coating processes).<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, disposed over the transparent<br>
cover layer 7 is a comparatively thick adhesive layer 9 which is applied over<br><br><br>
the entire flat side of the plate and which serves for fixing the reflection<br>
film 10 disposed thereover. The adhesive used for the adhesive layer 9 at<br>
least in the hardened final condition has a refractive index which is<br>
substantially equal to the refractive index of the prismatic structures 12<br>
projecting from the rear side of the reflection film 10. When applying the<br>
reflection film 10 it is pressed under a predetermined pressure in such a<br>
way that those prismatic structures 12 penetrate to a desired depth into<br>
the adhesive layer 9. For all light beams which impinge on the transparent<br>
reflection film 10 from the front, that is to say from above in the Figures,<br>
and which are propagated therethrough into the prismatic structures 12, no<br>
or only a greatly reduced level of total reflection occurs at the surface<br>
portions of the prismatic structures 12 which are covered by the adhesive<br>
of the adhesive layer 9, because of the equal or almost equal refractive<br>
indices; total reflection however is retained unreduced at the surface<br>
portions of the prismatic structures 12, which are not covered by adhesive.<br>
On average therefore that affords a reflectance on the part of the reflection<br>
film 10, which is reduced in comparison with the non-adhesive-coated<br>
condition thereof. The extent of the reduction in the reflectance depends on<br>
the depth of immersion of the prismatic structures 12 into the adhesive<br>
layer 9, which in turn can be controlled by the pressure exerted in the<br>
operation of applying the reflection film 10 and/or the viscosity of the<br>
adhesive which prevails at the time of applying the reflection film. It is thus<br>
possible to use a reflection film 10 which is very substantially transparent<br>
for the light of the flat capacitor or capacitors and which, prior to<br>
processing thereof, has a very high reflectance which is above the<br>
maximum value permitted by statute, that reflectance^, being reduced in a<br>
specific targeted fashion in production of the plate in such a way that it falls<br>
in the range which is permitted by statute.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 2 only differs from that shown in<br>
Figure 1 in that the adhesive layer 9 is not applied over the entire surface<br>
area but only partially to the top side of the transparent cover electrode 7<br>
and that the prismatic structures 12 projecting at the rear side of the<br>
reflection film 10, in the surface regions in which there is an adhesive layer<br><br><br>
9, are immersed completely into same so that the free spaces between<br>
them are entirely filled with adhesive. Therefore, no total reflection<br>
whatsoever takes place in those regions at the adhesive-covered surfaces<br>
of the prismatic structures 12. In contrast, in the surface regions in which<br>
there is no adhesive layer 9, the prismatic structures 12 retain their<br>
capability of total reflection to the full extent. Accordingly, by virtue of a<br>
suitable choice both of the size and also the distribution of the surface<br>
regions which are covered with an adhesive layer 9 and the adhesive-free<br>
surface regions disposed therebetween, it is possible to achieve a mean<br>
reflectance in respect of the reflection film 10, which is within the range<br>
permitted by statute, although the reflectance of the reflection film 10<br>
before processing exceeds the maximum permissible limit value.<br>
The adhesive layer 9 can be applied in different ways both in the<br>
embodiment of Figure 1 and also in the embodiment shown in Figure 2.<br>
One possible way involves using a screen printing process which<br>
makes it possible quickly and reliably to implement both application over<br>
the entire surface area as shown in Figure 1 and also the application limited<br>
to individual surface regions, with interposed adhesive-free surface regions,<br>
in an economical fashion.<br>
Another process involves using a transfer film which is covered on<br>
one side with an adhesive layer or an adhesive pattern and which is<br>
pressed with that layer leading against the uppermost layer of the flat<br>
capacitor or a layer covering the flat capacitor in order to transfer the<br>
adhesive on to that layer. Thereafter, the transfer film is detached and the<br>
reflection film is applied.<br>
Another possibility involves using an adhesive film which is coated<br>
with adhesive on both sides, wherein the adhesives on the two flat sides of<br>
the adhesive film can be the same or, adapted to the specific conditions<br>
involved, can be different from each other. Thus, particularly in the case<br>
shown in Figure 2, the lower adhesive layer is distributed over the entire<br>
surface area while only individual surface elements are covered with<br>
adhesive on the top side of the adhesive film. The layer thicknesses of the<br>
adhesives on the two sides of the adhesive film can be the same or<br><br>
different from each other. Using the lower adhesive layer, the adhesive film<br>
is stuck on to the uppermost layer of the flat capacitor or a layer covering<br>
same, while the reflection film is glued on to the top side of the adhesive<br>
film. As the adhesive film remains in the layer structure of the plate, it<br>
must be transparent in relation to the light emitted by the flat capacitor in<br>
operation.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 3 uses a reflection film 10' which<br>
comprises three layers, namely a foremost transparent cover layer 14<br>
which in turn includes prismatic structures 12 which are completely<br>
embedded into an intermediate layer 15 which is also transparent and the<br>
refractive index of which differs from that of the prismatic structures 12 so<br>
greatly that total reflection occurs at the interfaces. The reflection film 10'<br>
further includes a carrier layer 16 comprising a material which is not<br>
transparent for the light of the subjacent flat capacitor 4 through 7, for<br>
example aluminum, which is stuck by means of an adhesive layer (not<br>
shown) on to the top side of the transparent cover layer 7 or laminated<br>
thereon in some other fashion.<br>
In order here to reduce in the required fashion the initially very high<br>
reflectance of the reflection film 10', which is above the statutory limit<br>
value, the reflection film 10' is provided with a grid raster of through holes<br>
19, that is to say holes which extend through all layers 14 through 16, only<br>
some of the holes being shown in Figure 3. The diameter and the surface<br>
density of the holes 19 are on the one hand so selected that the reflectance<br>
of the reflection film 10' is reduced in the required fashion and at the same<br>
time sufficient light can issue from the flat capacitor 4 through 7 forwardly<br>
(that is to say upwardly in the Figures) in order to satisfy the statutory<br>
requirements in regard to the brightness of an illuminated plate, in<br>
particular a motor vehicle licence plate.<br>
The embodiment illustrated in Figure 4 again uses a reflection film 10<br>
which is transparent in relation to the light of the flat capacitor 4 through 7<br>
and from the rear side of which the prismatic structures 12 freely project. It<br>
is stuck on to the top side of the transparent cover electrode 7 with a thin<br>
adhesive layer 20 which here does not penetrate into the intermediate<br><br><br>
spaces between the prismatic structures 12. In order nonetheless to<br>
achieve the required reduction in the reflectance of the reflection film 10,<br>
those prismatic structures 12 are flattened off or rounded in such a way<br>
that, in the cross-section in Figure 4, they are of a substantially trapezoidal<br>
configuration, whereby their surface regions permitting total reflection are<br>
reduced in size.<br>
Flattening or rounding of the prismatic structures 12 can be effected<br>
by the film 10 being heated and pressed against a hard surface under a<br>
predetermined pressure. The extent of the flattening or rounding effect can<br>
be controlled by the level of the temperature used and/or the magnitude of<br>
the pressing pressure. It will be appreciated that, the more the prismatic<br>
structures 12 are flattened off, the greater will be the reduction in the<br>
reflectance of the film 10.<br>
Depending on the respective nature of the reflection film used<br>
however it may also be sufficient for it just to be heated to an elevated<br>
temperature for a given period of time in order to achieve the desired<br>
flattening or rounding of the prismatic structures, without pressure having<br>
to be applied at the same time to the film or the prismatic structures.<br>
When using other films, it may be sufficient only to exert a given<br>
pressure on the prismatic structures without in that respect specifically<br>
increasing the temperature. In this case also the period of time and the<br>
magnitude of the pressure can be employed as control parameters.<br>
In all those cases, the operation of heating and/or pressing the film<br>
10 can be effected either in a separate step in the process prior to the<br>
application thereof to the cover electrode 7 or a layer covering same, or<br>
during that application procedure.<br>
All the illustrated embodiments may include additional layers, in<br>
particular protective layers for covering the outward sides, which are not<br>
shown in the Figures. As an alternative to the embodiment shown in Figure<br>
1 it is also possible to apply pressure to the transparent reflection film 10 in<br>
such a way that the tips of the prismatic structures which project at the<br>
rear side thereof penetratingly advance as far as the cover electrode 7 or a<br>
transparent hard layer (not shown) disposed thereover, but substantially<br><br><br>
cannot deform same, because of its hardness. In that case the thickness of<br>
the adhesive layer 9 which is completely pierced by the prismatic structures<br>
12 is so selected that it only partially fills in respect of height the free<br>
spaces present between those prismatic structures, and thus reduces the<br>
reflectance of the reflection film 10 not completely but to the desired<br>
extent.<br>
The measures described hereinbefore by means of the embodiments<br>
by way of example in Figures 1 and 2 can also be adopted in combination.<br>
It is also possible to provide adhesive layers of differing thicknesses in<br>
different surface regions, those adhesive layers filling to different heights<br>
the free spaces between the prismatic structures 12.<br>
Another possibility involves applying the layers of the flat capacitor<br>
not under the reflection film 10 or 10' but on the top side thereof which is<br>
towards the person viewing the arrangement, in rastered form. As those<br>
layers do not transmit any light to the reflection film 10 or 10' or light<br>
reflected thereby cannot issue through the top side, a suitable choice in<br>
respect of the size and surface density of the electrically conductively<br>
interconnected raster points of the flat capacitor arrangement reduces the<br>
mean reflectance of the reflection film 10 or 10' in the desired manner and<br>
at the same time achieves the required brightness of the flat capacitor<br>
arrangement. In that case it is possible to use both completely transparent<br>
reflection films 10 and also reflection films 10' which include an opaque<br>
layer.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A process for the production of a plate, in particular a motor vehicle licence plate, in which<br>
initially at least one layer sequence forming an electroluminescence flat capacitor (4, 5, 6, 7) and<br>
thereafter a reflection film (10; 10') are applied to a carrier (1), wherein the reflection value of the<br>
reflection film (10; 10') is higher than the maximum statutory permissible value, and said reflection<br>
value is reduced by further production steps to such an extent that it is below the maximum statutory<br>
permissible value, characterised in that the reflection film (10') has a layer (16) which is opaque in<br>
relation to the light of the electroluminescence flat capacitor (4, 5, 6, 7) and that the further<br>
production steps involve providing the reflection film (10') with a grid raster of holes in which the<br>
size and surface density of the holes (19) are so selected that on the one hand the reflection value of<br>
the reflection film (10') averaged in relation to surface area comes to lie below the maximum value<br>
permitted by statute and on the other hand the brightness of the light passing through the openings<br>
from the electroluminescence flat capacitor (4, 5, 6, 7) averaged over the surface area exceeds the<br>
minimum value prescribed by statute.<br>
2.	A plate, in particular a motor vehicle licence plate, which includes a carrier (1), a reflection<br>
film (10; 10') and at least one layer sequence which as seen from the viewer is disposed behind the<br>
reflection film (10') and which forms an electroluminescence flat capacitor (4, 5, 6, 7), wherein the<br>
reflectance of the reflection film (10, 10'), which is originally above the maximum value permitted by<br>
statute, has been reduced in the course of the plate production process, characterised in that the<br>
reflection film (10') has a layer (16) which is opaque for the light of the electroluminescence flat<br>
capacitor, and that provided in the reflection film (10') is a grid raster of holes, the holes (19) of<br>
which extend through all layers of the reflection film (10') and the size and surface density thereof<br>
being so selected that the reflectance of the reflection film (10'), which results after application of the<br>
grid raster of holes, is below the maximum value permitted by statute.<br><br>
In a process for the production of a plate, in particular a motor vehicle licence plate, in which<br>
at least a layer sequence forming an electroluminescence flat capacitor (4, 5, 6, 7) and a reflection<br>
film (10; 10') are applied to a carrier (1), a reflection film (10, 10') is selected whose reflection value<br>
is higher than the maximum value permitted by statute, and said reflection value is reduced by further<br>
production steps to such an extent that it is below the maximum value permitted by statute.</td>
