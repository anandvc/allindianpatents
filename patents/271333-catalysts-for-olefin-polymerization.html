				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of olefin polymerization catalyst compositions, methods for the polymerization and copolymerization of olefins using a catalyst composition, and polyolefins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There exists a constant search to develop new olefin polymerization catalysts, catalyst activation processes, and methods of making and using catalysts that will provide enhanced catalytic activities and produce polymeric materials tailored to specific end uses.<br>
One type of catalyst system comprises so-called single site organometal compounds, particularly metallocene compounds and transition metal compounds. Metallocenes have been well explored, but less is known about the polymerization behavior of transition metal compounds. It is believed that transition metal compounds, those compounds that do not have a cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, fluorenyl, substituted cyclopentadienyl, substituted indenyl, or substituted fluorenyl group bound to the metal atom and are thus not metallocenes, may offer the potential to produce polymers with improved properties, as well as lower cost. Also of interest is the development of transition metal compound-based catalytic systems that can be activated with a variety of activating agents without requiring the use of relatively expensive aluminoxane or borate co-catalysts, yet still provide relatively high polymerization activities.<br>
Therefore, what are needed are new catalyst compositions and methods of making the catalyst compositions that afford high polymerization activities, and will allow polymer properties to be designed within the specification ranges for the desired end-use application.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention comprises catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, and methods for polymerizing olefins and using the catalyst<br><br>
compositions disclosed herein. The present invention encompasses new catalyst compositions comprising transition metal compounds of the following general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 wherein<br>
M can be selected from titanium, zirconium, or hafnium;<br>
(X1), (X2), (X3) and (X4) are independently selected from alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, silyl, amido, imido, imino, phosphinimide, formamidinyl, diphosphazane, alkoxide, aryloxide, thiol or halide, with the proviso that (X1), (X2), (X3) and (X4) are not all benzyl or not all trimethylsilylmethyl;<br>
(L1 )m(L2)n are neutral donor ligands, m and n are each 0, 1 or 2.<br>
In one aspect, the catalyst composition of this invention comprises a transition metal complex and an activator. Several different activators may be used to activate the transition metal compounds of this invention including, but not limited to, an aluminoxane, an organoboron compound, a clay material, an ionizing ionic compound, an ion-exchangeable layered compound exchanged with an electron-withdrawing anion, a chemically-treated solid oxide compound, a chemically-treated solid oxide compound combined with an organoaluminum compound, or a mixture of any or all of these activator components.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the activator comprises a chemically-treated solid oxide, which comprises a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion. In yet another aspect of this invention, the activator comprises a chemically-treated solid oxide in combination with an organoaluminum compound.<br>
In still another aspect, the catalyst composition of this invention comprises:<br>
a)	a transition metal compound;<br>
b)	a chemically-treated solid oxide comprising a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion, wherein<br>
the solid oxide can be silica, alumina, silica-alumina, aluminum phosphate, heteropolytungstates, titania, zirconia, magnesia, boria, zinc oxide, mixed oxides thereof, or mixtures thereof, and<br><br>
the electron-withdrawing anion can be fluoride, chloride, bromide, phosphate, triflate, bisulfate, sulfate, or combinations thereof; and<br>
c)        an organoaluminum compound with the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
can be a hydrocarbyl having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms; (X6) can be an alkoxide or aryloxide, any one of which having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, halide, or hydride; and n can be a number from 1 to 3, inclusive.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, for example, the transition metal compound can be prepared and can be employed along with triisobutylaluminum cocatalyst and a chemically-treated solid oxide comprising fluorided silica-alumina, sulfated alumina, or chlorided alumina. Further, the chemically-treated solid oxide optionally contains another metal or metal ion, including but not limited to, zinc. As used herein the chemically-treated solid oxide is also termed an "activator-support", of which fluorided silica-alumina, sulfated, and chlorided alumina are examples. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the acidic activator-support is not merely an inert support component of the catalyst composition, but is involved in effecting the observed catalytic chemistry.<br>
This invention also encompasses methods of making catalyst compositions that comprise contacting at least one transition metal compound and an activator, including but not limited to, an organoaluminum compound combined with a chemically-treated solid oxide. These methods also comprise contacting the transition metal compound catalyst, the organoaluminum cocatalyst, and the chemically-treated solid oxide, and optionally pretreating some or all of these components with an olefin compound, prior to initiating a polymerization reaction.<br>
The present invention further comprises methods for polymerizing olefins comprising contacting at least one olefin monomer and a catalyst composition under polymerization conditions to produce the polymer.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is the polyolefins described herein.<br>
This invention also encompasses an article that comprises the polymer produced with the catalyst composition of this invention.<br><br>
These and other features, aspects, embodiments, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed features.<br>

Catalyst Composition—The Activator<br>
In addition to the transition metal compounds disclosed herein, the catalyst composition of this invention further comprises an activator. In one aspect of this invention, the activator can be an aluminoxane, an organoboron compound, an ionizing ionic compound, a clay material, a chemically-treated solid oxide, a<br>
chemically-treated solid oxide combined with an organoaluminum compound, or any combination thereof. In another aspect of the invention, the clay material can be selected from clays and other natural and synthetic layered oxides, an exfoliated clay, an exfoliated clay gelled into another oxide matrix, a layered silicate mineral, a non-layered silicate mineral, a layered aluminosilicate mineral, a non-layered aluminosilicate mineral, cogelled clay matrices containing silica or other oxides, pillared clays, zeolites, clay minerals, other layered minerals, or combinations thereof, including, but not limited to, ion-exchangeable layered minerals (natural or synthetic) or composites made from such compounds, regardless of whether the layered structure remains intact or not. The activator may further comprise a combination or mixture of any of these activators.<br>
'IJie Chemically-Treated Solid Oxide<br>
In one aspect, the present invention encompasses catalyst compositions comprising a chemically-treated solid oxide which serves as an acidic activator-support, and which can be used in combination with an organoaluminum compound. In one aspect, the chemically treated solid oxide comprises a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion; wherein the solid oxide can be silica, alumina, silica-alumina, aluminum phosphate, heteropolytungstates, titania, zirconia, magnesia, boria, zinc oxide, mixed oxides thereof, or mixtures thereof; and wherein the electron-withdrawing anion can be fluoride, chloride, bromide, phosphate, triflate, bisulfate, sulfate, or any combination thereof.<br>
The chemically-treated solid oxide includes the contact product of at least one solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source. In one aspect, the solid oxide compound comprises an inorganic oxide. It is not required that the solid oxide compound be calcined prior to contacting the electron-withdrawing anion source. The contact product may be calcined either during or after the solid oxide compound is contacted with the electron-withdrawing anion source. In this aspect, the solid oxide compound may be calcined or uncalcined. In another aspect, the chemically-treated solid oxide may comprise the contact product of at least one calcined solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source.<br>
The chemically-treated solid oxide exhibits enhanced acidity as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide compound. The chemically-treated solid oxide also functions as a catalyst activator as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the chemically-treated solid oxide may function as an ionizing solid oxide compound by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand from the transition metal compound. However, the chemically-treated solid oxide is an activator regardless of whether it ionizes the transition metal compound, abstracts an anionic ligand to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-ligand bond in the transition metal compound, simply coordinates to an anionic ligand when it contacts the chemically-treated solid oxide, or any other mechanisms by which activation may occur. While the chemically-treated solid oxide activates the transition metal compound in the absence of cocatalysts, it is not necessary to eliminate cocatalysts from the catalyst composition. The activation function of the chemically-treated solid oxide is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing the corresponding untreated solid oxide. However, it is believed that the chemically-treated solid oxide functions as an activator, even in the absence of organoaluminum compound, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds.<br>
In one aspect, the chemically treated solid oxide of this invention comprises a solid inorganic oxide material, a mixed oxide material, or a combination of inorganic oxide materials, that is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, and optionally treated with a metal. Thus, the solid oxide of this invention encompasses oxide materials such as alumina, "mixed oxide" compounds thereof such as silica-alumina, and combinations and mixtures thereof. The mixed oxide compounds such as silica-alumina are single chemical phases with more than one metal combined with oxygen to form a solid oxide compound, and are encompassed by this invention.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the chemically-treated solid oxide further comprises a metal or metal ion selected from zinc, nickel, vanadium, silver, copper, gallium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, or any combination thereof. Examples of chemically-treated solid oxides that further comprise a metal or metal ion include,<br>
but are not limited to, zinc-impregnated chlorided alumina, zinc-impregnated fluorided alumina, zinc-impregnated chlorided silica-alumina, zinc-impregnated fluorided silica-alumina, zinc-impregnated sulfated alumina, or any combination thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the chemically-treated solid oxide of this invention comprises a solid oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Bronsted acidic behavior. The solid oxide can be chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion, to form a chemically-treated solid oxide. While not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that treatment of the inorganic oxide with an electron-withdrawing component augments or enhances the acidity of the oxide. Thus, the chemically treated solid oxide exhibits Lewis or Bronsted acidity which is typically greater than the Lewis or Bronsted acidity of the untreated solid oxide. One method to quantify the acidity of the chemically-treated and untreated solid oxide materials is by comparing the polymerization activities of the treated and untreated oxides under acid catalyzed reactions.<br>
In one aspect, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises a solid inorganic oxide comprising oxygen and at least one element selected from Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 of the periodic table, or comprising oxygen and at least one element selected from the lanthanide or actinide elements. (See: Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 11th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons; 1995; Cotton, F.A.; Wilkinson, G.; Murillo; C. A.; and Bochmann; M.

In one aspect of this invention, the solid oxide material can be chemically-treated by contacting it with at least one electron-with drawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion source. Further, the solid oxide material can be optionally chemically treated with a metal ion, then calcined to form a metal-containing or metal-impregnated chemically treated solid oxide. Alternatively, a solid oxide material and an electron-withdrawing anion source are contacted and calcined simultaneously. The method by which the oxide can be contacted with an electron-withdrawing component, typically a salt or an acid of an electron-withdrawing anion, includes, but is not limited to, gelling, co-gelling, impregnation of one compound onto another, and the like.

The electron-withdrawing component used to treat the oxide can be any component that increases the Lewis or Bronsted acidity of the solid oxide upon treatment. In one aspect, the electron-withdrawing component can be an electron-withdrawing anion derived from a salt, an acid, or other compound such as a volatile organic compound that may serve as a source or precursor for that anion. Examples of electron-withdrawing anions include, but are not limited to, sulfate, bisulfate, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluorosulfate, fluoroborate, phosphate, fluorophosphate, trifluoroacetate, triflate, fluorozirconate, fluorotitanate, trifluoroacetate, triflate, and the like, including mixtures and combinations thereof.

When the electron-withdrawing component comprises a salt of an electron-withdrawing anion, the counterion or cation of that salt may be any cation that allows the salt to revert or decompose back to the acid during calcining. Factors that dictate the suitability of the particular salt to serve as a source for the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to, the solubility of the salt in the desired solvent, the lack of adverse reactivity of the cation, ion-pairing effects between the cation and anion, hygroscopic properties imparted to the salt by the<br>
cation, and the like, and thermal stability of the anion. Examples of suitable cations in the salt of the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to, ammonium, trialkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl phosphonium, Ff', [H(OEt2)2]+, and the like.<br>
Further, combinations of one or more different electron-withdrawing anions, in varying proportions, can be used to tailor the specific acidity of the activator-support to the desired level. Combinations of electron-withdrawing components may be contacted with the oxide material simultaneously or individually, and any order that affords the desired activator-support acidity.<br>
Once the solid oxide has been treated and dried, it can be subsequently calcined. Calcining of the treated solid oxide is generally conducted in an ambient atmosphere, typically in a dry ambient atmosphere, at a temperature from about 200°C to about 900°C, and for a time of about 1 minute to about 100 hours. In another aspect, calcining can be conducted at a temperature fromi about 300°C to about 800°C and in another aspect, calcining can be conducted at a temperature from about 400°C to about 700°C.

Similarly, in another aspect of this invention, the chemically treated solid oxide comprises a chlorided solid oxide in the form of a particulate solid, thus a source of chloride ion is added to the oxide by treatment with a chloriding agent. The chloride ion may be added to the oxide by forming a slurry of the oxide in a suitable solvent. In another aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide can be treated with a chloriding agent during the calcining step. Any chloriding agent capable of serving as a source of chloride and thoroughly contacting the oxide during the calcining step can be used. For example, volatile organic chloriding agents may be used. Examples of volatile organic chloriding agents useful in this aspect of the invention include, but are not limited to, certain freons, perchlorobenzene, chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and combinations thereof. Gaseous hydrogen chloride or chlorine itself can also be used with the solid oxide during calcining. One convenient method of contacting the oxide with the chloriding agent is to vaporize a chloriding agent into a gas stream used to fluidize the solid oxide during calcination.<br>
In one aspect, the amount of fluoride or chloride ion present before calcining the solid oxide can be generally from about 2 to about 50% by weight, where the weight percents are based on the weight of the solid oxide, for example silica-alumina, before calcining. In another aspect, the amount of fluoride or chloride ion present before calcining the solid oxide can be from about 3 to about 25% by weight, and in another aspect, from about 4 to about 20% by weight. If the fluoride or chloride ion are added during calcining, such as when calcined in the presence of CC14, there is typically no fluoride or chloride ion in the solid oxide before calcining. Once impregnated with halide, the halided oxide may be dried by any method known in the art including, but not limited to, suction filtration followed by evaporation, drying under vacuum, spray drying, and the like, although it is also<br>
possible to initiate the calcining step immediately without drying the impregnated solid oxide.<br>

In one aspect, the pore volume may be greater than about 0.8 cc/g, and in another aspect, the pore volume may be greater than about 1.0 cc/g. Further, the silica-alumina may have a surface area greater than about 100 m2/g. In one aspect, the surface area is greater than about 250 m2/g, and in another aspect, the surface area may be greater than about 350 m2/g. Generally, the silica-alumina of this invention has an alumina content from about 5 to about 95%. In one aspect, the alumina content may be from about 5 to about 50%, and in another aspect, the alumina content may be from about 8% to about 30% alumina by weight.<br>
The sulfated solid oxide comprises sulfate and a solid oxide component such as alumina or silica-alumina, in the form of a particulate solid. Optionally, the sulfated oxide can be further treated with a metal ion such that the calcined sulfated oxide comprises a metal. In one aspect, the sulfated solid oxide comprises sulfate and alumina. In one aspect of this invention, the sulfated alumina is formed by a process wherein the alumina is treated with a sulfate source, for example, but not limited to, sulfuric acid or ammonium sulfate.<br>
In addition to being treated with an electron-withdrawing component such as halide or sulfate ion, the solid inorganic oxide of this invention may optionally be treated with a metal source, including metal salts or metal-containing compounds. In one aspect of the invention, these compounds may be added to or impregnated onto the solid oxide in solution form, and subsequently converted into the supported metal upon calcining. Accordingly, the solid inorganic oxide can further comprise a metal selected from zinc, nickel, vanadium, silver, copper, gallium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, or a combination thereof. For example, zinc may be used to impregnate the solid oxide because it provides good catalyst activity and low cost. The solid oxide may be treated with metal salts or metal-containing compounds before, after, or at the same time that the solid oxide is treated with the electron-withdrawing anion.<br><br>
Further, any method of impregnating the solid oxide material with a metal may be used. The method by which the oxide is contacted with a metal source, typically a salt or metal-containing compound, includes, but is not limited to, gelling, co-gelling, impregnation of one compound onto another, and the like. Following any contacting method, the contacted mixture of oxide compound, electron-withdrawing anion, and the metal ion is typically calcined. Alternatively, a solid oxide material, an electron-withdrawing anion source, and the metal salt or metal-containing compound are contacted and calcined simultaneously.<br>

While organoaluminoxanes with different types of R groups are encompassed by the present invention, methyl aluminoxane (MAO), ethyl aluminoxane, or isobutyl aluminoxane are typical activators used in the catalyst compositions of this invention. These aluminoxanes are prepared from trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, or triisobutylaluminum, respectively, and are sometimes referred to as poly(methyl aluminum oxide), poly(ethyl aluminum oxide), and poly(isobutyl aluminum oxide), respectively.  It is also within the scope<br><br>
of the invention to use an aluminoxane in combination with a trialkylaluminum, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,794,096, which is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.<br>
The present invention contemplates many values of n in the aluminoxane formulas (R-Al-0)n and R(R-Al-0)nAlR2, and advantageously n is at least about 3.

Generally, any amount of the aluminoxane capable of activating the transition metal compound may be utilized in this invention. In preparing the catalyst composition of this invention, the molar ratio of the aluminum in the aluminoxane to the transition metal compound in the composition is usually from about 1:1 to about 100,000:1. In one aspect, the molar ratio of the aluminum in the aluminoxane to the transition metal compound in the composition is from about 5:1 to about 15,000:1. In another aspect, the molar ratio of the aluminum in the aluminoxane to the transition metal compound in the composition is usually from about 5:1 to about 15,000:1.

One example of how an aluminoxane may be prepared is as follows. Water which is dissolved in an inert organic solvent may be reacted with an aluminum alkyl compound such as A1R3 to form the desired organoaluminoxane compound. While not intending to be bound by this statement, it is believed that this synthetic method can afford a mixture of both linear and cyclic (R-Al-0)n aluminoxane species, both of which are encompassed by this invention.    Alternatively, organoaluminoxanes may be prepared by reacting an<br><br>
aluminum alkyl compound such as A1R3 with a hydrated salt, such as hydrated copper sulfate, in an inert organic solvent.<br>

Any fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound known in the art can be utilized. The term fluoroorgano boron compounds has its usual meaning to refer to neutral compounds of the form BY3. The term fluoroorgano borate compound also has its usual meaning to refer to the monoanionic salts of a fluoroorgano boron compound of the form [cation]+[BY4]", where Y represents a fluorinated organic group. For convenience, fluoroorgano boron and fluoroorgano borate compounds are typically referred to collectively by organoboron compounds, or by either name as the context requires.<br>
Examples of fluoroorgano borate compounds that can be used as cocatalysts<br>

Generally, any amount of organoboron compound can be utilized in this invention. In one aspect, the molar ratio of the organoboron compound to the transition metal compound in the composition is from about 0.1:1 to about 10:1. In another aspect, the amount of the fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound used as a cocatalyst or activator for the transition metal compound is in a range of from about 0.5 mole to about 10 moles of boron compound per mole of transition metal compound.

Like the aluminoxane activator, the fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate activators may be supported or unsupported in the present invention. If supported, generally the support comprises an inorganic oxide, such as, silica, an aluminate compound, or combinations thereof. The use of a supported activator may result in a heterogeneous catalyst composition, and an unsupported activator can result in a homogeneous catalyst composition, and the present invention encompasses both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts.<br>

In accordance with this invention, the catalyst composition comprises at least one transition metal compound and an activator. In one aspect of this invention, the activator comprises at least one ionizing ionic compound. Examples of ionizing ionic compound are disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 5,576,259 and 5,807,938, each of which is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.<br><br>
An ionizing ionic compound is an- ionic compound which can function to activate or enhance the activity of the catalyst composition. While not bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may be capable of reacting with the transition metal compound and converting the transition metal compound into a cationic transition metal compound. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may function as an ionizing compound by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand, possibly a ligand such as (X1), (X2), (XJ) or (X4) from the transition metal compound. However, the ionizing ionic compound is an activator regardless of whether it-ionizes the transition metal compound, abstracts a (X) ligand in a fashion as to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-(X) bond in the transition metal compound, simply coordinates to any ligand, or any other mechanisms by which activation may occur. Further, it is not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate the transition metal compound only. The activation function of the ionizing ionic compound is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing catalyst composition that does not comprise any ionizing ionic compound.<br>

The Olefin Monomer<br>
Unsaturated reactants that are useful in the polymerization processes with catalyst compositions and processes of this invention include olefin compounds having from about 2 to about 30 carbon atoms per molecule and having at least one olefmic double bond. This invention encompasses homopolymerization processes using a single olefin such as ethylene or propylene, as well as copolymerization reactions with at least one different olefmic compound. In one aspect of a copolymerization reaction of ethylene, copolymers of ethylene comprise a major amount of ethylene (&gt;50 mole percent) and a minor amount of comonomer 
Acyclic, cyclic, polycyclic, terminal (a), internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non-functionalized olefins may be employed in this invention. For example, typical unsaturated compounds that may be polymerized with the catalysts of this invention include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl- 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, the five normal decenes, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. Cyclic and bicyclic olefins, including but not limited to, cyclopentene, cyclohexene,<br>
norbornylene, norbornadiene, and the like, may also be polymerized as despribed above.<br>
In one aspect, when a copolymer is desired, the monomer ethylene may be copolymerized with a comonomer. In another aspect, examples of the comonomer include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl- 1-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyl-l-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, or the five normal decenes. In another aspect, the comonomer may be 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, or styrene.<br>
In one aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone to produce the copolymer is generally from about 0.01 to about 10 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. In another aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone is from about 0.01 to about 5 weight percent comonomer, and in still another aspect, from about 0.1 to about 4 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. Alternatively, an amount sufficient to give the above described concentrations by weight, in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
While not intending to be bound by this theory, in the event that branched, substituted, or functionalized olefins are used as reactants, it is believed that steric hindrance may impede and/or slow the polymerization process. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might. In one aspect, at least one reactant for the catalyst compositions of this invention is ethylene, so the polymerizations are either homopolymerizations or copolymerizations with a different acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstituted olefin. In addition, the catalyst compositions of this invention may be used in polymerization of diolefin compounds, including but are not limited to, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,4-pentadiene, and 1,5-hexadiene.<br>
Preparation of the Catalyst Composition<br>
In accordance with this invention, the catalyst compositions were prepared by a process comprising contacting a transition metal compound with an activator. The contact process of preparing the catalyst of this invention may be carried out in an inert atmosphere and under substantially anhydrous conditions. In one aspect, the atmosphere is substantially oxygen-free and substantially free of water as the reaction begins, to prevent deactivation of the catalyst. This contacting procedure can occur in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, blending or mixing. Further, each of the catalyst composition components can be fed into the reactor separately, or various combinations of these compounds can be contacted together prior to being further contacted with additional catalyst components, or all compounds can be contacted together before being introduced into the reactor.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the catalyst composition is prepared by contacting the transition metal compound and the chemically-treated solid oxide component to form a first mixture, and then contacting this first mixture with an organoaluminum compound to form a second mixture comprising the catalyst composition. In the first mixture, the transition metal compound and the chemically-treated solid oxide component may be contacted from about 1 minute to about 24 hours at a temperature from about 10°C to about 100°C. In another aspect, the transition metal compound and the chemically-treated solid oxide component may be contacted from about 1 minute to about 1 hour at a temperature from about 15°C to about 50°C.<br>
In another aspect of this invention, the catalyst composition is prepared by contacting the transition metal compound, the organoaluminum compound, and the chemically-treated solid oxide component before injection into a polymerization reactor. In this aspect, the transition metal compound, organoaluminum compound, and the chemically-treated solid oxide are contacted for a period from about 1 minute to about 24 hours. In one aspect, this contact step occurs from about 1 minute to about 1 hour, and at a temperature from about 10°C to about 200°C. In another aspect, this contact step occurs at a temperature from about 20°C to about SOX.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is contacting a transition metal compound such as any of transition metal compounds A through R with an organoaluminum compound such as Al(isobutyl)3 for about 30 minutes to form a first mixture, prior to contacting this first mixture with a chemically-treated solid oxide activator-support such as chlorided silica-alumina to form a second mixture. Once the second mixture of all the catalyst components is formed, it is optionally allowed to remain in contact from about 1 minute to about 24 hours prior to using this second mixture in a polymerization process.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is contacting a transition metal compound such as any of transition metal compounds A through -N with an organoaluminum compound such as Al(isobutyl)3 and with an a-olefin monomer such as 1-hexene for about 30 minutes to form a first mixture, prior to contacting this first mixture with an acidic activator-support such as chlorided alumina to form a second mixture. Once the second mixture of all the catalyst components is formed, it is optionally allowed to remain in contact from about 1 minute to about 24 hours prior to using this second mixture in a polymerization process.<br>
In one aspect, the weight ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the treated solid oxide component in the catalyst composition may be from about 5:1 to about 1:1000. In another aspect, the weight ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the treated solid oxide component in the catalyst composition may be from about 3:1 to about 1:100, and in another aspect, from about 1:1 to about 1:50. These weight ratios are based on the combined weights of organoaluminum, treated oxide, and transition metal compound used to prepare the catalyst composition, regardless of the order of contacting the catalyst components.<br>
In another aspect, the weight ratio of the treated solid oxide component to the transition metal compound in the catalyst composition may be from about 10,000:1 to about 1:1. In another aspect, the weight ratio of the treated solid oxide component to the transition metal compound in the catalyst composition may be from about 1000:1 to about 10:1, and in yet another aspect, from about 250:1 to about 20:1.   These weight ratios are based on the combined weights of<br>
organoaluminum, treated oxide, and transition metal compound used to prepare the catalyst composition, regardless of the order of contacting the catalyst components.<br>
Utility of the Catalyst Composition in Polymerization Processes<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention can be carried out in any manner known in the art. Such polymerization processes include, but are not limited to slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and the like, including multi-reactor combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce ethylene-containing polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor.<br>
After catalyst activation, a catalyst composition is used to homopolymerize ethylene, or copolymerize ethylene with a comonomer. In one aspect, a typical polymerization method is a slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process), which is well known in the art and is disclosed, for example in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. Other polymerization methods of the present invention for slurry processes are those employing a loop reactor of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,239,235 which is also incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>
In one aspect, polymerization temperature for this invention may range from about 60°C to about 280°C, and in another aspect, polymerization reaction temperature may range from about 70°C to about 110°C.<br>
The polymerization reaction typically occurs in an inert atmosphere, that is, in atmosphere substantial free of oxygen and under substantially anhydrous conditions, thus, in the absence of water as the reaction begins. Therefore a dry, inert atmosphere, for example, dry nitrogen or dry argon, is typically employed in the polymerization reactor.<br>
The polymerization reaction pressure can be any pressure that does not adversely affect the polymerization reaction, and it typically conducted at a pressure higher than the pretreatment pressures.    In one aspect, polymerization<br>
ressures may be from about atmospheric pressure to about 1000 psig. In another aspect, polymerization pressures may be from about 50 psig to about 800 psig. Further, hydrogen can be used in the polymerization process of this invention to control polymer molecular weight.<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention can be carried out in any manner known in the art. Such processes that can polymerize monomers into polymers include, but are not limited to slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and multi-reactor combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce olefin-containing polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor can be utilized for a batch process, or the reaction can be carried out continuously in a loop reactor or in a continuous stirred reactor. Typically, the polymerizations disclosed herein are carried out using a slurry polymerization process in a loop reaction zone. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons which are liquid under reaction conditions. The term "diluent" as" used in this disclosure does not necessarily mean an inert material, as this term is meant to include compounds and compositions that may contribute to polymerization process. Examples of hydrocarbons that can be used as diluents include, but are not limited to, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, propane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Typically, isobutane is used as the diluent in a slurry polymerization. Examples of this technology are found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,424,341; 4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280; and 5,597,892; each of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety.<br>
For purposes of the invention, the term polymerization reactor includes any polymerization reactor or polymerization reactor system known in the art that is capable of polymerizing olefin monomers to produce homopolymers or copolymers of the present invention. Such reactors can comprise slurry reactors, gas-phase reactors, solution reactors, or any combination thereof. Gas phase reactors can comprise fluidized bed reactors or tubular reactors. Slurry reactors can comprise vertical loops or horizontal loops. Solution reactors can comprise stirred tank or autoclave reactors.<br>
Polymerization reactors suitable for the present invention can comprise at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, at least one reactor system, at least one polymer recovery system or any suitable combination thereof. Suitable reactors for the present invention can further comprise any one, or combination of, a catalyst storage system, an extrusion system, a cooling system, a diluent recycling system, or a control system. Such reactors can comprise continuous take-off and direct recycling of catalyst, diluent, and polymer. Generally, continuous processes can comprise the continuous introduction of a monomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent.<br>
Polymerization reactor systems of the present invention can comprise one type of reactor per system or multiple reactor systems comprising two or more types of reactors operated in parallel or in series. Multiple reactor systems can comprise reactors connected together to perform polymerization, or reactors that are not connected. The polymer can be polymerized in one reactor under one set of conditions, and then the polymer can be transferred to a second reactor for polymerization under a different set of conditions.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one loop slurry reactor. Such reactors are known in the art and can comprise vertical or horizontal loops. Such loops can comprise a single loop or a series of loops. Multiple loop reactors can comprise both vertical and horizontal loops. The slurry polymerization can be performed in an organic solvent that can disperse the catalyst and polymer. Examples of suitable solvents include butane, hexane, cyclohexane, octane, and isobutane. Monomer, solvent, catalyst and any comonomer are continuously fed to a loop reactor where polymerization occurs. Polymerization can occur at low temperatures and pressures. Reactor effluent can be flashed to remove the solid resin.<br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems can employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through the fluidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. The<br><br>
recycle stream can be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product can be withdrawn from the reactor and new or fresh monomer can be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors can comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone.<br>
In still another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise a tubular reactor. Tubular reactors can make polymers by free radical initiation, or by employing the catalysts typically used for coordination polymerization. Tubular reactors can have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer can be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components can be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams are intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor can comprise a solution polymerization reactor. During solution polymerization, the monomer is contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed during polymerization to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. The polymerization can be effected in a batch manner, or in a continuous manner. The reactor can comprise a series of at least one separator that employs high pressure and low pressure to separate the desired polymer.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise the combination of two or more reactors. Production of polymers in multiple reactors can include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polymers resulting from the first polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one of the reactors can be different from the operating conditions of the other reactors. Alternatively, polymerization in multiple reactors can include the manual transfer of polymer from one reactor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Such reactors can include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas reactors, a combination of loop and gas reactors, a combination of autoclave reactors or solution reactors with gas or loop reactors, multiple solution reactors, or multiple autoclave reactors.<br>
After the polymers are produced, they can be formed into various articles, including but not limited to, household containers, utensils, film products, drums, fuel tanks, pipes, geomembranes, and liners. Various processes can form these articles. Usually, additives and modifiers are added to the polymer in order to provide desired effects. By using the invention described herein, articles can likely be produced at a lower cost, while maintaining most or all of the unique properties of polymers produced with transition metal compound catalysts.<br>
Definitions<br>
In order to more clearly define the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls.<br>
The term polymer is used herein to mean homopolymers comprising ethylene and/or copolymers of ethylene and another olefinic comonomer. Polymer is also used herein to mean homopolymers and copolymers of acetylenes.<br>
The term inert atmosphere is used herein to refer to any type of ambient atmosphere that is substantially unreactive toward the particular reaction, process, or material around which the atmosphere surrounds or blankets. Thus, this<br>
term is typically used herein to refer to the use of a substantially oxygen-free and moisture-free blanketing gas, including but not limited to dry argon, dry nitrogen, dry helium, or mixtures thereof, when any precursor, component, intermediate, or product of a reaction or process is sensitive to particular gases or moisture. Additionally, inert atmosphere is also used herein to refer to the use of dry air as a blanketing atmosphere when the precursors, components, intermediates, or products of the reaction or process are only moisture-sensitive and not oxygen-sensitive. However, inert atmosphere, as used herein, would typically exclude C02 or CO because these gases may be reactive toward the particular reaction, process, or material around which they would surround or blanket, despite their occasional use as inert blanketing gases in other processes.<br>
The terms catalyst composition, catalyst mixture, and the like are -used herein to refer to the mixture of catalyst components disclosed herein, regardless of the actual product of the reaction of the components, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of any one component such as organometal compound and activator. Therefore, the terms catalyst composition, catalyst mixture, and the like include both heterogeneous compositions and homogenous compositions.<br>
The term hydrocarbyl is used to specify a hydrocarbon radical group that includes, but is not limited to aryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkadienyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, and the like, and includes all substituted, unsubstituted, branched, linear, heteroatom substituted derivatives thereof.<br>
The terms activator, cocatalyst, and related terms are generic descriptors used to refer to the compounds, compositions, or mixtures that are contacted with the transition metal compounds to form the catalyst: compositions of this invention, regardless of any particular reaction or mechanism by which such compounds, compositions, or mixtures function. Activators include, but are not limited to: compounds such as an aluminoxane, an organoboron compound, an ionizing ionic compound, a clay material, a chemically-treated solid oxide, or any combination thereof. In another aspect, the term activator is used to refer to compositions or mixtures, examples of which include, but are not limited to,<br>
mixtures of chemically-treated solid oxides and organoaluminum compounds, and mixtures of clays or other layered materials and organoaluminum compounds.<br>
The term chemically-treated solid oxide is used interchangeably with terms such as solid acidic activator-support, acidic activator-support, or simply activator-support, and the like to indicate a chemically-treated, solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits enhanced Lewis acidic or Bransted acidic behavior, arising through treatment of the solid oxide with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion or an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. These terms are not used to imply this component is inert, and it should not be construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition. Rather, the chemically-treated solid oxides in combination with the organoaluminum compounds comprise activators of the transition metal compounds and comprise an insoluble component of the catalyst composition of this invention to produce polymers, and at which the active catalytic sites are situated, and are not intended to be limiting.<br>
Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the typical methods, devices and materials are herein described.<br>
All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed above and throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.<br>
For any particular compound disclosed herein, any general structure presented also encompasses all conformational isomers, regioisomers, and stereoisomers that may arise from a particular set of substituents. The general structure also encompasses all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other optical isomers whether in enantiomeric or racemic forms, as well as mixtures of stereoisomers, as the context requires.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various other aspects, embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims.<br>
In the following examples, unless otherwise specified, the syntheses and preparations described therein were carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen and/or argon. Solvents were purchased from commercial sources and were typically dried over activated alumina prior to use, or distilled from potassium metal prior to use. Unless otherwise specified, reagents were obtained from commercial sources.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Testing Methods<br>
A "Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Nitrogen Pore Size Distribution Instrument," acquired from the Quantachrome Corporation, Syosset, N.Y., was used to determined surface areas and pore volumes of the treated oxide activator-supports of this invention. The melt Index (MI) of the polymer product was determined using a 2.16 kg load and High Load Melt Index (HLMI) was determined with a 21.6 kg load at 190 °C according to ASTM D-1238. Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) on a compression molded sample, cooled at about 15°C per hour, and conditioned for about 40 hours at room temperature in accordance with ASTM D1505 and ASTM D1928, procedure C.<br>
Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a PL 220 SEC high temperature chromatography unit (Polymer Laboratories) with trichlorobenzene (TCB) as the solvent, with a flow rate of 1 mL/minute at a temperature of 145°C. BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) at a concentration of 0.5 g/L was used as a stabilizer in the TCB. An injection volume of 200 uL was used with a nominal polymer concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. Dissolution of the<br>
sample in stabilized TCB was carried out by heating at 150°C for 5 hours with occasional, gentle agitation. The columns used were three Mixed A LS columns (7.8x300mm) and were calibrated with a broad linear polyethylene standard (ChevronPhillips Marl ex® BHB 5003 resin) for which the molecular weight had been determined.<br>

Example 3 Preparation of Sulfated Alumina Activator-Support<br>
W.R. Grace Alumina A was first calcined in air at 1200-1400°F (648.8-760°C). After calcining, the pore volume was 1.4-1.8 cc/g and the surface area was 300-325 m2/g). Then the alumina was impregnated to incipient wetness using an aqueous solution of H2S04to a loading of 15-16% S04 by weight. This material was then flash-dried at 300-350°F (148.8-176.6°C). The sulfated alumina was then passed through a 50 mesh screen to remove any large particles. Approximately 10 grams of this dry sulfated alumina material was then calcined in a bed fluidized by dry air or nitrogen at a hold temperature of 600°C for 3-4 hours. During this  calcining step,  the temperature was first ramped up to the hold<br>
temperature at a rate of 4°C/ min. The gas flow was 1.6-1.8 SCFH. After calcining, the sulfated alumina was stored under dry nitrogen until used.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 General Description of the Polymerization Runs<br>
Polymerizations were carried out in a 1 gallon Autoclave Engineers stirrer reactor, fitted with an oil-less packing with a flat stirrer running at 700 rpm. The reactor temperature was regulated by controlling the temperature of the water in the steel jacket using steam and water heat exchangers, with electronic instrumentation to control flows. Catalysts were added while the autoclave temperature was below 40°C under a purge of isobutane. The autoclave was then sealed and 2 L of isobutane were added and stirring started at 700 rpm. Reactor heating was then initiated and as the reactor temperature approached 60°C, ethylene addition was initiated. The hexene was flushed in with the ethylene from an in-line vessel on top of the reactor. The set point temperature and pressure were then rapidly attained. The reactor was held under these conditions for 60 minutes by feeding ethylene on demand. The polymerization was then terminated by venting the volatiles to the flare system. This process left the polyethylene as a wet solid in the reactor, which was collected, and the solid air dried to yield granular polyethylene.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Polymerization using [bis(2,6-ditertbutylphenolato)]titanium dichloride, (A)<br>
For each run, to a 1 gallon Autoclave Engineers stirred reactor was added 1 raL of a 1M solution of triisobutylaluminum (TDBAL) in hexanes as a co-catalyst, 10 mg of the transition metal complex A and 200 mg of the sulfated alumina from Example 3. The autoclave was sealed and 2 L of isobutane was added and stirring started at 700 rpm. The reactor heating was then initiated. As the reactor approached 60°C, ethylene (and 1-hexene, if used) was added. The reactor was held at set point for 60 minutes by feeding ethylene on demand.    The<br>
polymerization was terminated by venting the volatiles to the flare system. This procedure left the polyethylene as a wet solid in the reactor. The polyethylene solid was then air dried. The results are summarized in Table 1.<br>

EXAMPLE 6 Polymerization Process Using [tetrakis(2,6-diisopropylphenolato)]zirconium, (B)<br>
To a 1 gallon Autoclave Engineers stirred reactor was added 15 mg of the transition metal complex B, 200 mg of the sulfated alumina from Example 3, and 1 mL of a 1M solution of triisobutylaluminum (TIBAL) in hexanes as a co-catalyst. The autoclave was sealed and 2 L of isobutane were added and stirring started at 700 rpm. The reactor heating was then initiated. As the reactor approached 60°C, ethylene addition was begun. The set point of 90°C and 550 psig was then rapidly attained. The reactor was held at set point for 60 minutes by feeding ethylene on demand. The polymerization was terminated by venting the volatiles to the flare system. This procedure left the polyethylene as a wet solid in the reactor. The polyethylene solid was then air dried. The results are summarized in Table 2.<br>

For each run, to a 1 gallon Autoclave Engineers stirred reactor was added 10 mg of the transition metal complex C and 200 mg of the sulfated alumina from Example 3, and 1 mL of a 1M solution of triisobutylaluminurn in hexanes. The autoclave was sealed and 2 L of isobutane was added and stirring started at 700 rpm. The reactor heating was then initiated. As the reactor approached 60°C, ethylene (and 1-hexene, if used) was added. The set point of 90°C and 550 psig was then rapidly attained. The reactor was held at set point for 60 minutes by feeding ethylene on demand. . The polymerization was terminated by venting the volatiles to the flare system. This procedure left the polyethylene as a wet solid in the reactor. The polyethylene solid was then air dried. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br>
