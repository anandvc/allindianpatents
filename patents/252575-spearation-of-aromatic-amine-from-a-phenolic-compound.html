				<td>SEPARATION OF AMINE FROM A PHENOLIC COMPOUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for separation of an aromatic amine<br>
from a phenolic compound in a mixture comprising the aromatic amine and<br>
phenolic compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aromatic amines are important industrial chemicals. They can be used to<br>
produce a very important class of industrial compounds such as azo dyes.<br>
Aromatic amines can be produced by chemical reduction of nitro compounds with<br>
a metal and acid such as, for example, iron or tin and hydrochloric acid or by<br>
catalytic hydrogenation using molecular hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst<br>
such as nickel or platinum. Nitro compounds can be readily made by direct<br>
nitration of aromatic compounds.<br>
The product mixture produced by catalytic hydrogenation of an aromatic<br>
nitro compound generally comprises the desired amine, a corresponding phenolic<br>
compound, and unreacted aromatic nitro compound. These by-products, because<br>
of their color and deleterious effects on product properties, are undesirable and are<br>
difficult to separate from the amines by distillation. Therefore, there is an<br>
increasing need for the reduction of impurities to increase the amine purity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process comprises contacting a product mixture with a base, optionally<br>
in the presence of a polyhydric alcohol, to produce a base-treated mixture and<br>
distilling the base-treated mixture in which the product mixture comprises an<br>
aromatic amine and a phenolic compound.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aromatic amine can be produced by catalytic reduction or<br>
hydrogenation of an aromatic nitro compound, either under liquid phase or gas<br>
phase. The reduction or hydrogenation can be carried out under any suitable<br>
conditions known to one skilled in the art, continuously, semi-continuously, or<br>
batch-wise. A suitable condition can include a temperature in the range of from<br>
about 30°C to about 300°C, preferably about 80°C to about 250°C; a pressure that<br>
can accommodate the temperature such as about 1 atm (103 kPa) to about 20 arm<br>
(300 psig, 2000 kPa), preferably about 150 kPa to about 800 kPa; and for a<br>
sufficient period of time such as from about one to about 100 minutes.<br>
Any hydrogenation catalysts known to one skilled in the art such as, for<br>
example, nickel, iron, platinum, copper, cobalt, palladium, iridium, and<br>
combinations of two or more thereof can be used in the production of aromatic<br>
amiue. Generally, a catalyst can be present in a catalytic amount effective to<br>
catalyze the hydrogenation or reduction and can be in the range of from about 1 to<br>
about 10,000 ppm (mg per kg) aromatic nitro compound.<br>
The hydrogenation or reduction process produces a product mixture or<br>
crude product, which comprises desired amine and impurities. A desired amine<br>
can have the formula of RAr(CH2)pNR1 where Ar is an arylene group; R and each<br>
R1 can be the same or different; each R1 is independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen, halogen, alkyl group, aryl group, and combinations of two<br>
or more thereof; and p is a number from 0 to 3. Examples of amine products<br>
include, but are not limited to, aniline, toluidines, chloroanilines, bromoanilines,<br>
iodoanilines, chlorotoluidines, bromotoluidines, iodotoluidines, benzylamine, Nbenzylamine,<br>
ethylanilines, fluoromethylanilines, chloromethylanilines,<br>
bromomethylanilines, and combinations of two or more thereof. These disclosed<br>
examples include all possible isomers.<br>
For example, aniline can be produced by the reduction of nitrobenzene<br>
with hydrogen either in the liquid phase using a supported hydrogenation catalyst<br>
such as nickel or precious metal, or in the gas phase using supported catalysts.<br>
Phenol is a byproduct, in trace amounts ranging from about 50 to about 1000 mg<br>
per kg amine product (ppm). Aniline can also be produced by conversion of<br>
phenol in the Halcon process.<br>
Also for example, toluidine can be produced by reduction of nitrotoluene.<br>
Nitrotoluene can be vaporized at a temperature in the range of from about 150°C<br>
to about 400°C to obtain a vapor or gas phase of nitrotoluene. The vapor phase<br>
nitrotoluene is then introduced or fed to suitable equipment such as a gas phase<br>
vessel or reactor, preferably a fixed bed reactor containing a hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
Hydrogen can be introduced into the equipment, preferably contemporaneously with<br>
Hie vapor phase nitrotoluene.<br>
Impurities or by-products associated with the production of aromatic amines<br>
include, but are not limited to, unreacted nitro compounds, cyclohexanones, phenolic<br>
compounds, ketones, and combinations of two or more thereof. Examples of phenolic<br>
compounds include, but are not limited to, phenol, cresols, chlorophenols,<br>
bromophenols, iodophenols, oholortDluidinoa chlorotoluidines. bomiotoluidinco<br>
bromotoluidines, iodotoluidines, benzylamine, N-benzylamine, ethylphenols,<br>
fluoromethylphenols, chloromethylphenols, bromomethylphenols and combinations<br>
of two or more thereof. These disclosed examples include all possible isomers.<br>
Any unreacted nitro compound can be present in the product mixture in<br>
the range of from 0 to about 1000 ppm and can be readily removed from the<br>
crude product by any means known to one skilled in the art such as, for example,<br>
distillation. Because such means are well known, the description of which is<br>
omitted herein for the interest of brevity.<br>
Ideally, a desired amine compound contains lower than 500, preferably<br>
lower than 100, and more preferably lower than 50 parts per million (mg/kg) of<br>
such phenolic compound.<br>
According to the invention, the product mixture (or crude product) can be<br>
contacted with a base before it is distilled. Any base, organic or inorganic, can be<br>
used. For example, suitable bases can include, without limitation, lithium hydroxide,<br>
sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrosulfide, sodium bisulfide, potassium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydrosulfide, potassium bisulfide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfide, sodium oxide,<br>
magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, calcium carbonate, sodium phenoxide, barium<br>
phenoxide, calcium phenoxide, tetramethylammonium hydroxide,<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide,<br>
tetramethylammonium bisulfide, tetraethylammonium bisulfide, and combinations of<br>
any two or more thereof. Potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide are preferred<br>
for they are readily available and inexpensive.<br>
A base can be combined with the crude product at any concentration<br>
effective to reduce the phenolic compound contamination to the desired level<br>
disclosed above. Generally, the molar ratio of base to phenolic compound<br>
can be in the range of from about 0.5:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 1:1 to<br>
about 3:1 or about 1:1 to about 2:1. The contacting of the crude product with<br>
a base can be carried out under any suitable conditions. For example, such<br>
condition can include a temperature in the range of from about 0°C to about<br>
200°C, preferably about 20°C to about 50°C, a pressure that can<br>
accommodate the temperature such as about 1 IcPa to about 300 kPa,<br>
preferably about 10 kPa to about 110 kPa, and for a sufficient period of time<br>
such as from about 0.01 to about 10,000 minutes.<br>
Combining a base and an amine can also be carried out in the presence of<br>
a polyhydric alcohol. Examples of polyhydric alcohol include, but are not limited<br>
to trimethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, glycerols, etiiylene glycol, diethylene<br>
glycol, 1,2-propane diol, 1,3-propane diol, tripropylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycols, polyprop3dene glycols, and combinations of two or more thereof. The<br>
polyhydric alcohol can be present in the base-amine combination in the range of<br>
from about 1 to about 10,000 mg per kg of the total combination.<br>
Thereafter, a desired amine can be recovered from the base-treated<br>
crude product (or product mixture) by, for example, distillation. Suitable<br>
apparatus for the distillation is any customary apparatus as described for<br>
example in Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Ed.<br>
Vol. 7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979, pages 870-881, such as sieve<br>
plate columns, bubble cap columns or columns packed with arranged or<br>
dumped packing. The distillation can be carried out in a single column or a<br>
plurality of columns, such as 2 or more columns. Any distillation techniques<br>
known to one skilled in the art can be used. A suitable distillation can<br>
include a temperature in the range of from about 100 to about 400, preferably<br>
about 100 to about 250°C, a pressure that can accommodate the temperature<br>
such as about 0.1 kPa to about 200 IcPa, preferably about 5 kPa to about<br>
30 kPa, and for a sufficient period of time such as from about 1 to about 1500<br>
minutes.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1; This example illustrates reduction of phenol in aniline us|ng<br>
KOH.<br>
To a distillation flask was added 100 ml of commercial aniline containing<br>
122 ppm (rng/kg) phenol (a final product produced from a DuPont commercial<br>
plant at Beaumont, Texas, USA) and potassium hydroxide (53.5 mg) dissolved in<br>
64.4 mg of water. This was connected to a distillation head containing a short<br>
vigreux column. Reduced pressure (42 mmHg (5.6 kPa)) distillation was<br>
continued until 75 ml of aniline was in the receiver. GC analysis of the distillate<br>
revealed the phenol content was 7.4 ppm. The phenol content of the material still<br>
in the distilling flask was 321 ppm based on 25 ml aniline remaining in the flask.<br>
Similarly, 100 ml of commercial aniline and potassium hydroxide (52 mg)<br>
in 66 mg of water was added to a distillation flask. This was vacuum distilled at<br>
40 mmHg (5.33 kPa) and three cuts taken, 79.4g, 8.1g and 8.4g. The phenol<br>
content of these cuts were respectively 4 ppm, 3 ppm, and 
The phenol content of the distillation residue was 2391 ppm.<br>
Example 2. This example shows reduction in phenol content in aniline using<br>
NaOH.<br>
To a distillation flask was added 100 ml of commercial aniline (phenol<br>
122 ppm) and sodium hydroxide (35.7 mg) dissolved in 93 mg of water. The<br>
same procedure as Example 1 was followed. The distillate (75 ml) had a phenol<br>
content of 19 ppm. The phenol content of the material remaining in the distilling<br>
was 374 ppm.<br>
Example 3. This example shows using KOH and unrectified crude aniline.<br>
A series of runs was conducted using a sample of crude, unrectified,<br>
aniline obtained from a commercial plant, which had a phenol content of 107 ppm<br>
to determine the efficiency of removing phenol with various doses of potassium<br>
hydroxide. An unrectified aniline was a crude plant aniline which had been<br>
dewatered but not detared in the final (rectifying) distillation column.<br>
To a distillation flask was added 50 ml of crude aniline and 35 ul of 50%<br>
potassium hydroxide in water. Distillation was performed at 90 mm Hg (12 kPa)<br>
pressure using a five plate Oldershaw column and vacuum distillation head.<br>
Distillation was stopped on obtaining 48.9 g of aniline distillate. This had a<br>
phenol content of 2.7 ppm. The results are shown in the following table.<br>
Example 4. This example illustrates using a polyhydric alcohol.<br>
To a distilling flask was added 50 ml of crude aniline, 40 ul of 50%<br>
potassium hydroxide and 100 ul of polyethylene glycol (avg. Mn ca. 400, "PEG<br>
400", Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). The resulting<br>
mixture was vacuum distilled at 90 mm giving 46.6 g of aniline distillate<br>
containing 1.1 ppm of phenol.<br>
Example 5. This example shows treating o-toluidine with KOH.<br>
Aqueous potassium hydroxide solution (45%; 0.1055 g) was charged<br>
into a three neck round bottom flask (500 ml) followed by 123.5g of otoluidine<br>
(OTOL) containing 489.1 ppm of o-cresol. OTOL was a<br>
commercial product commercially available from First Chemical Corp.,<br>
Pascagoula, Mississippi. An Aldrich Oldershaw column (ten stages) with a<br>
short path distillation head on top of the column was attached to the flask.<br>
The mixture in the flask was agitated with a magnetic spin bar while vacuum<br>
was gradually pulled down to 90 mmHg (12 IcPa). The pot temperature was<br>
raised using a heating mantle to distill OTOL. The typical distillation<br>
conditions were: pot temperature 130°C, overhead temperature 125°C,<br>
vacuum 90 mmHg (12 kPa). The distillation was stopped when boil up<br>
slowed down and the overhead temperature started falling. Distillate<br>
(108.5 g) was collected and was analyzed with GC to find o-cresol nondetectable.<br>
In separate runs, a plant distilled OTOL sample, obtained from a<br>
storage tank, having 133.3 ppm of o-cresol was used. A different amount of<br>
o-cresol was added to the sample to make OTOL with different<br>
concentrations of o-cresol. The OTOL was then mixed with aqueous KOH<br>
solution (45%) at different KOH/o-cresol mole ratios and distilled through a<br>
ten-stage Oldershaw column under vacuum. The distillation conditions<br>
were similar to the plant OTOL distillation conditions disclosed above. The<br>
results summarized in the following table (ND denotes non-detectable)<br>
demonstrate that the invention process substantially reduced the o-cresol<br>
content in OTOL.<br>

Example 6. This example shows using a potyhydric alcohol to stabilize<br>
excess KOH.<br>
In another separate run, o-cresol was added to OTOL to raise the ocresol<br>
concentratiqn to 8.8%. About 1.6 equivalent of KOH (45%) was<br>
charged. The pot temperature was raised under vacuum to strip water and<br>
then to reflux OTOL for 8 hours. At the end of the reflux, OTOL (20% of<br>
the charge) was distilled through the ten-stage column. The overhead<br>
sample showed 10.1 ppm of o-cresol. The potassium o-cresolate<br>
concentration was about 14% in the pot. It was noted that some white salt<br>
(excess KOH) coated on the flask bottom. Poly(ethylene glycol) was then<br>
added to the pot. The amount of PEG charged was the same as the KOH<br>
(45%) charge. After being agitated at 120°C for 20 minutes, all the salts<br>
went into the solution.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
