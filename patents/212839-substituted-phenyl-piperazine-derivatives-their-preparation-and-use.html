Substituted phenyl-piperazine derivatives, their preparation and use<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted phenyl-piperazine derivatives potently binding to the 5-HTIA receptor, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and the use thereof for the treatment of certain psychiatric and neurological disorders. Many of the compounds of the invention are also potent serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or D3/D4 ligands and are thus considered to be particularly useful for the treatment of depression and psychosis.<br>
Background Art<br>
Clinical and pharmacological studies have shown that 5-HTIA agonists and partial agonists are useful in the treatment of a range of affective disorders such as generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and aggression.<br>
It has also been reported that 5-HTIA ligands may be useful in the treatment of ischaemia.<br>
An overview of 5-HTIA antagonists and proposed potential therapeutic targets for these antagonists based upon preclinical and clinical data are presented by Schechter et al, Serotonin, 1997, Vol.2, Issue 7. It is stated that 5-HTIA antagonists may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, senile dementia, dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, and in combination with SSRI antidepressants also to be useful in the treatment of depression.<br>
5-HT reuptake inhibitors are well known antidepressant drugs and useful for the treatment of panic disorders and social phobia.<br>
The effect of combined administration of a compound that inhibits serotonin reuptake and a 5-HTiA receptor antagonist has been evaluated in several studies (Innis, R.B. et al., Eur. J,   Pharmacol, 1987,143, p 195-204 and Gartside, S.E., Br. J, Pharmacol 1995,115, p 1064-1070, Blier, P. et al Trends Pharmacol ScL 1994,15,220). In these studies, it was found that combined 5-HTIA receptor antagonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors would produce a more rapid onset of therapeutic action.<br><br>
Dopamine D4 receptors belong to the dopamine D2 subfamily of receptors, which is considered to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics. The side effects of neurroleptic drugs, which primarily exert their effect via antagonism of D2 receptors, are known to be due to D2 receptor antagonism in the striatal regions of the brain. However, dopamine D4 receptors are primarily located in areas of the brain other than striatum, suggesting that antagonists of the dopamine D4 receptor will be devoid of extrapyramidal side effects. This is illustrated by the antipsychotic clozapine, which exerts higher affinity for D4 than D2 receptors, and is lacking extrapyramidal side effects (Van Tol et al. Nature 1991, 350, 610; Hadley Medicinal Research Reviews 1996,16, 507-526 and Sanner Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998, 5, 383-393).<br>
A number of D4 ligands, which were postulated to be selective D4 receptor antagonists (L-745,879 and U-101958) have been shown to posses antipsychotic potential (Mansbach et al. Psychopharmacology 1998,135,194-200). However, recently it has been reported that these compounds are partial D4 receptor agonists in various in vitro efficacy assays (Gazi et al. Br, J. Pharmacol 1998,124, 889-896 and Gazi et al Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999,128, 613-620). Furthermore, it has been shown that clozapine, which is an effective antipsychotic, is a silent antagonists (Gazi et al. Br. J. Pharmacol 1999,128, 613-620).<br>
Consequently, D4 ligands, which are partial D4 receptor agonists or antagonists, may have beneficial effects against psychoses.<br>
Dopamine D4 antagonists may also be useful for the treatment of cognitive deficits (Jentsch et al. Psychopharmacology 1999,142, 78-84).<br>
It has also been suggested that dopamine D4 antagonists may be useful to reduce dyskinesia occurring as a result of the treatment of Parkinson's disease with L-dopa (Tahar et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol 2000, 399, 183-186).<br>
Dopamine D3 receptors also belong to the dopamine D2 subfamily of receptors, and they are preferentially located in limbic regions of the brain (Sokoloff et al. Nature, 1990, 347,146-151), such as the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine receptor blockade has been associated with antipsychotic activity (Willner Clinical Psychopharmacology 1997, 12, 297-308). Furthermore, an elevation of the level of D3 receptors in the limbic part of<br><br>
schizophrenic brains has been reported (Gurevich et al. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 1997, 54, 225-32). Tlierefore, D3 receptor antagonists may offer the potential for an effective antipsychotic therapy, free of the extrapyramidal side effects of the classical antipsychotic drugs, which primarily exert their effect by blockade of D2 receptors (Shafer et al. Psychopharmacology 1998, 135, 1-16; Schwartz et al. Brain Research Reviews 2000, 31, 277-287).<br>
Moreover, D3 receptor blockade results in a slight stimulation in the prefrontal cortex (Merchant et al. Cerebral Cortex 1996, 6, 561-570), which could be beneficial against negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. In addition, dopamine D3 antagonists can reverse D2 antagonist-induced EPS (Millan et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol 1997, 321, R7-R9) and do not cause changes m prolactin (Reavill et al. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 2000, 294, 1154-1165). Consequently, D3 antagonistic properties of an antipsychotic drug could reduce the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits and result in an improved side effect profile with respect to EPS and hormonal changes.<br>
Dopamine D3 agonists have also been considered relevant in the treatment of schizophrenia (Wustow et al. Current Pharmaceutical Design 1997, 3, 391-404).<br>
Accordingly, agents acting on the 5-HTIA receptor, both agonists and antagonists, are believed to be of potential use in the therapy of psychiatric and neurological disorders and thus being highly desired. Furthermore, antagonists at the same time having potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity and/or D4 and/or D3 activity may be particularly useful for the treatment of various psychiatric and neurological diseases.<br>
Structural similar compounds to the compounds of the present invention have been<br>
described earlier.<br>
Thiophene derivatives are described in WO 9902516 as ligands for the 5-HTIA- receptor.<br>
"WO 9726252 describes piperazinyl derivatives as insecticides.<br>
WO 9514004 describes substituted alkylamino-indole derivatives as 5-HTIA ,5-HTIB and 5-<br>
HT1D- derivatives.<br><br>
It has now been found that compounds of a certain class of phenyl-piperazine derivatives bind to the 5-HTIA receptor with high affinities. Furthermore, it has been found that many of these compounds have other highly beneficial properties as i.e. potent serotonin reuptake inhibition activity and/or affinity for the D4 and/or the D3 receptor.<br>

Some of the compounds of the present invention contain chiral centres and such compounds exist in the form of isomers (e.g. enantiomers). The invention includes all such isomers and any mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures.<br>
Racemic forms can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example, by separation of diastereomeric salts thereof with an optically active acid, and liberating the optically active amine compound by treatment with a base. Another method for resolving racemates mto the optical antipodes is based upon chromatography on an optically active matrix. Racemic compounds of the present invention can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallisation of d- or 1- (tartrates, mandelates, or camphorsulphonate) salts for example. The compounds of the present invention may also be resolved by the formation of diastereomeric derivatives.<br>
Additional methods for the resolution of optical isomers, known to those skilled in the art, may be used. Such methods include those discussed by J. Jaques, A. Collet, and S. Wilen in "Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1981).<br>
Optically active compounds can also be prepared from optically active starting materials.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared by one of the following methods comprising:<br>
a) reacting a secondary amine of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein R1-R6, X, Y and m are as defined above with an alkylating agent of the general formula:<br><br>
and R7 , R8 , Z and n are as defined above and G is a suitable leaving group such as halogen, mesylate or tosylate;<br>
b) reacting a compound of the formula<br><br>
wherein R1-R6, X, Y, n and m are as defined above and Q(0H)2 is a diol such as substituted ethylene glycol or propylene glycol or a polymer bound diol; with a hydrazine of the formula <br><br><br>
wherein Z, R1-R8, X, Y, n and m are as defined above.<br><br>
VII<br>
wherein R1-R8, Y, X and m are as defined above<br>
The alkylations according to method a are generally performed by boiling the reactants under reflux or by heating them at a fixed temperature in a suitable solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile, methyl isobutyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethanol, 2-propanol, ethyl acetate, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in the presence of a base such as thethylamine or potassium carbonate and optionally a catalylic amount of potassium iodide.<br>
1)<br><br><br>
Secondary amines of fonnula HI are prepared by the reaction sequence outlined above. 2-Fluoro-nitrobenzene is reacted with a nucleophile of formula VIII in an aprotic solvent such as N,N"dimethylformamide using organic or inorganic basis at elevated temperature. After reduction of the intermediate nitro compound IX using standard conditions such as palladium catalysed hydrogenation or iron in acidic solvents, the aniline derivative X was transfonned into the desired secondary amme of fonnula HI. The piperazine formation was either performed by reaction with bis(2-chloroethyl)amine, hydrochloride at elevated temperature or in a multistep synthesis according to published procedures (Kruse et al. Reel. Trav, Chim. Pays-Bas, 1988,107, 303-309).<br>
2)<br><br>
Alternatively, secondary amines of formula III are prepared using the mono substituted cyclic diamines of formula XII as key intermediate. The substituent R is an appropriate<br><br>
protecting group such as a ethoxy-, methoxy- or 2-methyl-2-propyloxy-carbonyl group or a benzyl group, or a suitable solid support such as a Merrifield resin or a solid supported carbamate group such as the wang resin based carbamate linker (Zaragoza, Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 8677-8678). The mono substituted cyclic diamines of formula Xn are<br>
 prepared from commercially available starting materials or by methods obvious to the chemist skilled in the art. The mono substituted cyclic diamine of formula XE are reacted with ri^-l,2-dichlorobezene-T5-cyclopentadienyIiron(II) hexafluorophosphate at elevated temperature in an aprotic solvent such as dry tetrahydrofuran using an appropriate base such as potassiirai carbonate. η6-l32-dichlorobezene-η5-cyclopentadienyliron(n)<br>
 hexafluorophosphate are prepared in analogy to literature procedures (Pearson and Gelormani, J. Org. Chem. 1994,59,4561-4570). The thus formed mono chloro derivative of formula XHI are subsequently reacted with a nucleophile of formula VIII in an aprotic solvent such as dry tetrahydrofuran either by the use of an appropriate base such as potassium carbonate or by deprotonation of the nucleophile of formula VIII using a base<br>
  such as sodium hydride prior to the reaction. Decomplexation, perfonned according to literature procedures (Pearson et al., J. Org.

4-[(4-Nitrophenoxy)carbonyloxymetliyl)phenoxymethyl polystyrene (267.0 g, 235 mmol) was suspended in dry N,N-dimethylformamide (2 L). N-Methylmorpholine (238.0 g, 2.35 mol) and piperazine (102.0 g, 1.17 mol) were added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hrs. The resin was filtered off and washed with N,N-dimethylformamide<br><br>
(2 X IL), tetrahydrofuran (2 X 1 L), water (1 X 500 mL), methanol (2 X 1 L), tetrahydrofuran (2X1 L), methanol (1X1 L). Finally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3 X 500 mL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 36 hrs) to yield an almost colourless resin (240.0 g).<br>
A part of the resin thus obtained (115.1 g, 92 mmol) was suspended in dry tetrahydrofiiran (1.6 L) and η 6-l,2-dichlorobenzene-'η 5-cyclopentadienyliron(II) hexafluorophosphate (76,0 g, 184 mmol) was added followed by potassium carbonate (50.9 g, 368 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 16 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was filtered off and washed with tetrahydrofuran (2 X 500 mL), water (2 X 250 mL), tetrahydrofiiran (2 X 500 mL), water (2 X 250 mL), methanol (2 X 250 mL), dichloromethane (2 X 500 mL), methanol (2 X 250 mL). Finally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3 X 500 mL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 36 hrs) to yield a dark orange resin (142 g).<br>
To a solution of 2-hydroxyanisole (2.2 g,. 17.7 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) was carefully added neat sodium hydride (15.5 mmol) at room temperature (Caution: Generation of hydrogen). The mixture was stirred additional 30 min after the generation of hydrogen ceased. Subsequently, a part of the above obtained resin (2.8 g, 1.72 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 12 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was filtered off and washed with tetrahydrofuran (2 X 50 mL), tetrahydrofuran/water (1:1) (2 X 50 mL), N,N-dimethylformamide (2 X 50 mL), water (2 X 50 mL), methanol (3 X 50 mL), tetrahydrofuran (3 X 50 mL), and subsequently with methanol and tetrahydrofuran (each 50 mL, 5 cycles). Fmally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3 X 50 mL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 12 hrs).<br>
The thus obtained resin (3.0 g, 1.84 mmol) and a 0.5 M solution of 1,10-phenanthroline in a 3:1 mixture of pyridine/water (20 mL) was placed in a light-transparent reactor tube. For decomplexation, the suspension was vortexed and irradiated with visible light for 12 hrs. A very characteristic feature of the decomplexation step is the appearance of the intensive red colour of the liquid phase during irradiation. The resin was filtered off and washed with methanol (2 X 25 mL), water (2 X 25 ml) and tetrahydrofuran (3 X 25 mL) until the washing solutions kept colourless (5 cycles) and the irradiation procedure was repeated until<br><br>
decomplexation was complete (5 cycles). After complete decomplexation, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3 X 25 mL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 12 h).<br>
The resin (approx. 2.5 g, 1.84 mmol) was suspended in a l:l-mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and dichloromethane (25 mL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs. The resin was filtered off and washed with methanol (1X5 mL) and dichloromethane (1X5 mL). The liquid phases were combined and the volatile solvents were evaporated to yield a dark brown oil (1.5 g)<br>
The oil was dissolved in acetonitril (10 mL). To the thus obtained solution, potassium carbonate (46 mg, 0.33 mmmol) and 3-(3-bromopropyl)-lH-indole (33 mg, 0.14 mmol) were added and the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 12 hrs. Isocyanomethyl polystyrene (250 mg, 0.29 mmmol) was added and the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature. The resin was filtered off and washed with methanol (1X2 mL) and dichloromethane (1 X 2 mL). The combined liquid phases were evaporated from volatile solvents to yield a dark brown oil. The crude product was purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC chromatography. The resulting solution was subsequently loaded on a pre-conditioned ion exchange colunm. The column was washed with methanol (4 mL) and acetonitrile (4 mL), followed by elution of the product with 4 N solution of ammonia in methanol (4.5 mL).

l-[2'(l,4-Benzodioxan-5-yloxy)phenyl]-4-[3-(5-JluorO'lH'indol-3-yl)propyl]pipera^ (5a),<br>
2-(3-Chlorobutyl)-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethoxymethyl polystyrene (70 g, 90.3 mtnol) was suspended in dry N,N-dmaethylformamide (700 mL). Sodium iodide (68 g, 452 mmol) was added followed by diisopropylethylamine (232 mL, 1.36 mol) and piperazine (117 g, 1.36 mol). The reaction mixture was heated at 80 °C under stirring for 12 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was filtered off and washed with N,N-dimethylformamide (3 X 500 mL), methanol (3 X 500 mL), tetrahydroJEuran (3 X 500 mL), and subsequently with methanol and tetrahydrofuran (each 250 mL, 5 cycles). Finally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3 X 500 mL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 36 hrs) to yield an almost colourless resin (76 g).<br>
A part of the obtained resin (50 g, 60.6 mmol) was then suspended in dry tetrahydrofuran (600 mL). η -l,2-Dichlorobenzene-η -cyclopentadienyliron(II) hexafluorophosphate (48 g, 116.2 mmol) was added followed by potassium carbonate (32 g, 233 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 12 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was filtered off and washed with tetrahydrofuran (2 X 500 mL), water (2 X 250 mL), tetrahydrofuran (2 X 500 mL), methanol (2 X 250 mL), dichloromethane (2 X 500 mL), methanol (2 X 250 niL). Finally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3 X 500 niL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 36 hrs) to yield a dark orange resin (70 g).<br>
To a solution of 5-hydroxy-1,4-benzodioxane (2.8 g, 18.4 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) was carefully added neat sodium hydride (15.5 mmol) at room temperature (Caution: Generation of hydrogen). The mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min after the generation of hydrogen ceased. Subsequently, a part of the above obtained resin (2.8 g, 2.3<br><br>
mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 12 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was filtered off and washed with tetrahydrofuran (2 X 50 mL), tetrahydrofuran/water (1<br>
:1) (2 X 50 mL), N,N-dimethylformamide (2 X 50 raL), water (2 X 50 mL), methanol (3 X 50 mL), tetrahydrofuran (3 X 50 mL), and subsequently with methanol and tetrahydrofuran (each 50 mL, 5 cycles). Finally, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3X50 mL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 12 hrs).<br>
A part of the obtained resin (200 mg, 0.15 imnol) and a 0.5 M solution of 1,10-phenanthroline in a (3:l)-mixture of pyridine/water (10 mL) was placed in a light-transparent reactor tube. The suspension was vortexed and hradiated for 12 hrs. A very characteristic feature of the decomplexation step is the appearance of the intensive red colour of the liquid phase during irradiation. The resin was filtered off and washed with methanol (2 X 10 mL), water (2 X 10 ml) and tetrahydrofuran (3 X 10 mL) until the washing solutions kept colourless (ca. 5 cycles) and the irradiation procedure was repeated until decomplexation was complete (ca. 4 cycles). After complete decomplexation, the resin was washed with dichloromethane (3 X 10 mL) and dried in vacuo (25 °C, 12 hrs).<br>
The obtained resin (160 mg, 0.15 mmol) and 4-fluorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (35 mg, 0.21 mmol) were mixed in a reactor tube. A 0.5 M solution of anhydrous zinc chloride in acetic acid (1.5 mL) was added and the reaction tube was sealed. The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hrs at 70 °C, After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was filtered and the residual resin washed with dimethyl sulfoxide (1.5 mL). Saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution (1.5 mL) was added carefully to the combined filtrates(Caution: Generation of carbondioxide). The solution was loaded on a pre-conditioned reversed phase C"18 column. The column was washed with water (4 mL) and the product was eluted with methanol (4,5 mL). After evaporation of the volatile solvents, the crude product was purified by preparative reversed phase HPLC chromatography. The resulting solution was subsequently loaded on a pre-conditioned ion exchange column. The column was washed with methanol (4 mL) and acetonitrile (4 mL), followed by elution of the product with 4 N solution of ammonia in methanol (4.5 mL). Evaporation of the volatile solvents afforded the title compound 5a as yellow oil (2 mg), LC/MS (m/z) 488 (MH+, Rt = 4.22, purity: 84 %.<br><br>
