Description<br>
Amino-1,3,5-triazines N-substituted with chiral bicyclic radicals, process for their preparation, compositions thereof, and their use as herbicides and plant growth regulators.<br>
The invention relates to optically active isomers of some<br>
2-aminoÂ»4-(bicyclyl)amino-6-(substituted alkyl)-1,3,5-triazine derivatives, processes for their preparation, to compositions and intermediates thereof, and to their use as herbicides or plant growth regulators for the control of undesired plants or vegetation.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
WO 97/31904 and EP-A-0864567 describe the preparation of 2-amino-4-bicyclyl-amino-1,3,5-triazines and their use as herbicides and plant growth regulators. The reference generically describes various amino -1,3,5-triazine derivatives which are substituted with some radicals comprising one or more centres of chirality in principle. The specifically disclosed derivatives, however, were described as mixtures of stereoisomers only, such as racemic mixtures of enantiomers or mixtures of diastereomers in their racemic forms. In some cases, the known active substances have disadvantages when used, for example have an insufficient herbicidal action against harmful plants, too rigid applicational limitations related to weather, climate and/or soil conditions, too narrow a spectrum against weeds or too little crop selectivity.<br>
It has now been found that surprisingly specific optically active isomers of certain substituted 2~amino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives possess advantageous applicational properties compared with the prior art compounds or corresponding racemic compounds or other optical isomers thereof.<br><br>
For instance they are very active herbicides which can be used for the control of a range of harmful weeds, having surprisingly more potent herbicidal efficacy than stereoisomers thereof or racemic mixtures thereof.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a compound which is an optically active compound of formula (I):<br>
in which: <br>
R1 is H, halogen, (C1- C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)haloalkyl( [(C1-C4)alkoxy](C1-C6)alkylf (C3-<br>
Ce)cycloalkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected<br>
from the group consisting of halogen, (C1-C4)aikyl and (C1-C4)haloalkyl, or is (C2-<br>
C6)aikenyl, (C2-C6)alkynyl, (C2-C6)haloalkenyl, (C4-C6)cycioalkenyl, (C4-<br>
C6)halocycloalkenyl, (C1-C6)alkoxy or (C1-C6)haloalkoxy;<br>
R2 is H, halogen, (C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C4)alkoxy; or<br>
R1 and R2can together with the attached carbon atom form a (C3-C6)cycloaIkyl or<br>
(C4-C6)cycloalkenyl ring;<br>
R3 is H, (C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C4)alkoxy or halogen;<br>
R4 and R5 are each independently H, (C1-C4)alkyl, (C1-C4)haloalkyl, (C3-C4)alkenyl,<br>
(C3-C4)haIoalkenyl, (C3-C4)alkynyl, (C3-C4)haloalkynyl or an acyl radical;<br>
R6 is H, (C1-C6)alkyl or (C1-C6)alkoxy;<br>
R7, R8, R9 and R10 are each independently H, (C1-C4)alkyi, (C1-C3)haloalkyl, halogen<br>
(C1-C3)alkoxy, (C1-C3)haloalkoxy or CN;<br><br>
A is CH2, O or a direct bond;<br>
and the stereochemical configuration at the marked 1 position is (R) having a<br>
stereochemical purity of from 60 to 100 % (R), preferably 70-100 % (R), in particular<br>
80-100 % (R), based on the content of stereoisomers having (R)- and (S)-<br>
configurations at this position;<br>
or an agriculturally acceptable salt thereof.<br>
For reference purposes in formula (I) certain ring carbon atoms are marked from 1 to 3, whilst the carbon atom bonded to the triazine ring is marked 1*.<br>
In the present invention the stereochemical configuration at the marked 1 position is fixed as being predominantly (R) according to the Cahn-lngold-Prelog system, however the subject matter of the invention is also directed to all stereoisomers at other locants which are encompassed by formula (I), and their mixtures. Such compounds of the formula (I) contain, e. g. one or more additional asymmetric carbon atoms or else double bonds which are not stated specifically in the formula (I). It will be understood that the present invention embraces both the pure isomers and more or less enriched mixtures thereof, where the asymmetric carbon atom in marked 1 position is in the R-configuration or, in mixtures, a compound or compounds of same chemical constitution have the R-configuration in marked 1 position or are present in a ratio that compounds having the R-configuration are predominantly present (at least 60 % R-configuration) whilst the other asymmetric carbon atom(s) may be present in racemic form or are more or less resolved too. Provided the condition for the stereochemical configuration at marked 1 position is met, the possible stereoisomers which are defined by their specific spatial form, such as enantiomers, diastereomers, Z- and E-isomers, are all encompassed by formula (I) and can be obtained by customary methods from mixtures of the stereoisomers, or else be prepared by stereoselective reactions in combination with the use of stereochemically pure starting materials.<br>
Dependent on the definition of the radicals R1, R2 and R3 one possible additional centre of asymmetry referred to above is the carbon atom marked 1* in formula (I), in<br><br>
which case the compound of formula (I) according to the invention can exist as at<br>
least two pure stereoisomeric forms, i. e. (1R,1*R) and (1R,1*S) selected from the<br>
four pure stereoisomers which exist in principle. A further centre of asymmetry may<br>
also be present at the carbon atom marked 2 in formula (I), in which case the<br>
compound of the invention can exist as at least four pure stereoisomeric forms, each<br>
of these additional asymmetric carbon atoms having (R) or (S) configuration<br>
according to the Cahn-ingold-Prelog system, i.e. pure isomers having the<br>
configuration (1R,1*R,2R), (1R,1*R,2S), (1R,1*S,2R) and (1R,1*S,2S), selected from<br>
the eight pure stereoisomers which exist in principle. Moreover depending on the<br>
nature of the groups R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10, further asymmetric	(<br>
carbon atoms may be present-Where in the formulae shown hereinafter, a specific stereochemical configuration is defined at any position, for example at the carbon atom marked 1, 2 or 1*, unless otherwise defined, it means that the stereochemical purity at the marked position is 60 to 100 %, preferably 70-100 %, in particular 80-100 %, most preferably 100 %. "Stereochemical purity" means the amount of the stated stereoisomer expressed as a percentage of the total amount of stereoisomers having the given chiral centre.<br>
The invention also encompasses any keto and enol tautomer forms and mixtures and salts thereof, if respective functional groups are present.<br>

The compounds of the formula (I) can form salts by addition of a suitable inorganic or organic acid such as, for example, HCI, HBr, H2SO4 or HNO3, or a mono- or bifunctional carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, to a basic group such as, for example, amino or alkylamino.<br>
Some compounds of the formula (I) can form salts by addition of a suitable inorganic or organic base. Such compounds (I) have a functional group which contain an "acidic hydrogen atom", such as the carboxyl or the sulfonyl group, which may be a substituent in the definition of the acyl group. Examples of these salts are metal salts, particularly alkaline metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably, sodium- or potassium salts, or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts, such as ammonium salts or salts of organic amines, or quaternary ammonium salts.<br><br>

in which R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 and A are as defined in formula (I), or the reaction of compounds of formula (XII):<br><br>
in which<br>
R6, R7, R8, R9( R10 and A are as defined in formula (I) and L4 is a leaving group such<br>
as halogen, hydroxy, methyl sulfonyloxy or 4-toluenesulfonyloxy, with ammonia or a<br>
salt thereof, according to known procedures for example as described in patent<br>
publication number WO 97/031904.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of formula (I), in which one or more asymmetric<br>
carbon atoms is present as a single enantiomeric form, the above processes can be<br><br>
adapted by employing the appropriate enantiomeric or diastereomeric form of the compounds of formula (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII) or (XII). Compounds of formula (II) in an enantiomerically pure form are known or can be prepared according to known procedures, for example as described in Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1994, 5, 981, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans 1,1979, 2248 and the literature cited therein.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula (I) in resolved form or partially resolved form may, for example, be carried out by following the above-defined processes using one or more intermediates (II), (III), (IV) or (V) whose configuration differs from the configuration as defined in the compound of formula (I) to be prepared, and resolving the mixture obtained according to known methods of resolution.<br>
It is generally possible to use customary methods for optical resolutions (cf. Textbooks of Stereochemistry), for example following processes for separating mixtures into diastereomers, for example physical processes, such as crystallization, chromatographic processes, in particular column chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography, distillation, if appropriate under reduced pressure, extraction and other processes, it is possible to separate the remaining mixtures of enantiomers, generally by chromatographic separation on chiral solid phases. Suitable for preparative amounts or use on an industrial scale are processes such as     ( the crystallization of diastereomeric salts which can be obtained from the compounds (I) using optically active acids and, if appropriate, provided that acidic groups are present, using optically active bases.<br>
Optically active acids which are suitable for optical resolution by crystallization of diastereomeric salts are, for example, camphorsulfonic acid, camphoric acid, bromocamphorsulfonic acid, quinic acid, tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid and other analogous acids; suitable optically active bases are, for example, quinine, cinchonine, quinidine, brucine, 1-phenylethylamine and other analogous bases.<br><br>
The crystallizations are then in most cases carried out in aqueous or aqueous-organic solvents, where the diastereomer which is less soluble precipitates first, if appropriate after seeding. One enantiomer of the compound of the formula (I) is then liberated from the precipitated salt, or the other is liberated from the crystals, by acidification or using base.<br>
Enantiomerically pure amine intermediates of formula (V) may be prepared using known methods, for example as described in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4. Auflage, Band E 21b, 1833 ff. or Band E 21es 5133. One of the preferred procedures is the reductive amination of ketones of formula (XI) with asymmetric catalysis, including enzymatic transamination. Another procedure for the preparation of enantiomerically pure amines of formula (V), is the racemate cleaving method described in J. Prakt. Chem. 339, (1997), pages 381 - 384, or a procedure described in Org. Lett, Vol. 3, Nr. 25, page 4101. In this procedure the racemic amine of the general formula (V) is acylated enantioselectively with an acylating agent such as an optionally substituted fatty acid ester (preferably methyl chloroacetate or ethyl chloroacetate or methyl methoxyacetate or ethyl methoxyacetate) in the presence of a biocatalyst. The non-acylated enantiomer is then separated by simple treatment with mineral acid. The acylated amine enantiomer is then cleaved back to the corresponding amine, using a base for example an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, or an acid, for example a mineral acid such as hydrogen chloride.<br>
As biocatalysts, lipases, for example Pseudomonas cepacia, Candida cylindracea or Candida antarctica, are particularly suitable for this purpose. Certain of these lipases are also commercially available in immobilized form (brand name: "Novozym 435").<br>
By analogy with said enzymatic acylation method the compounds of formula (XIII) or (XIV) can be prepared as intermediates by acylation of racemic amines corresponding to compounds of formula (V), in principle,<br><br><br>
wherein R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 and A are as defined in formula (I), and R11     is acyl, preferably (d-CeJalkanoyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, (C1-C4)alkoxy and (C1-C4)alkylthio; more preferably formyl, acetyl, propionyl, haloacetyl, halopropionyl, (C1-C4)alkoxyacetyl or (C1--C4)aikoxypropionyl, most preferably chloroacetyl or methoxyacetyl;<br>
the desired optical isomer (V) is then obtained by cleaving compound (XIII) by using mineral acid, or, in the case when acylated compound (XIV) is formed enzymatically, using the non-acylated amine (V) directly.<br>
The following acids, for example, are suitable for preparing the acid addition salts of<br>
the compounds of the formula (I): hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid or<br>
hydrobromic acid, furthermore phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, mono- or	{<br>
bifunctional carboxylic acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, salicylic acid, sorbic acid or lactic acid, and also sulfonic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid and 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid. The acid addition compounds of the formula (I) can be obtained in a simple manner by the customary methods for forming salts, for example by dissolving a compound of the formula (I) in a suitable organic solvent, such as, for example, methanol, acetone, methylene chloride or benzene, and adding the acid at temperatures from 0 to 100Â°C, and they can be isolated in a known manner, for example by filtration, and, if appropriate, purified by washing with i     an inert organic solvent.<br><br>
The base addition salts of the compounds of the formula (I) are preferably prepared in inert polar solvents such as, for example, water, methanol or acetone at temperature from 0 to 100Â°C. Examples of suitable bases for preparing the salts according to the invention are alkali metal carbonates, such as potassium carbonate, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example NaOH or KOH, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, for example NaH, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal alkoxides, for example sodium methoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, or ammonia or ethanolamine. Quaternary ammonium salts can be obtained, for example, by salt exchange or condensation with quaternary ammonium salts of the<br>
formula [NRR'R"R'"]+X" where R, R', R" and R"' independently of one another are (C1-C4)alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and X' is an anion, for example CI" or OH".<br>

Compounds of formula (II), (IV), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X), (XI) and (XII), as well as racemic (III) and (V) are known or may be prepared analogously to known methods.<br>
A collection of compounds of formula (I) which can be synthesized by the abovementioned processes can additionally be prepared in parallel fashion, which<br><br>
can be effected manually, partly automated or fully automated. In this context, it is possible to automate the procedure of the reaction, work-up or purification of the products or intermediates. In total, this is to be understood as meaning a procedure which is described, for example, by S. H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, published by Escorn, 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
For carrying out the reaction and work-up in parallel fashion, a series of commercially available apparatuses can be used as they are available from, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England     f or H + P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschleissheim, Germany. To carry out the parallel purification of compounds (I) or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, there are available, inter alia, chromatographic equipment, for example from ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA. The equipment mentioned makes possible a modular procedure, where the individual steps are automated, but manual operation has to be carried out between the steps. This can be circumvented by employing partly or fully integrated automation systems, in which the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained from, for example,<br>
Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
i<br>
In addition to the above-described methods, compounds of formula (I) can be prepared in full or partly by solid-phase supported methods. To this end, individual intermediates or all intermediates of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to the procedure in question are bound to a synthesis resin. Solid-phase supported synthetic methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example: Barry A. Bunin in 'The Combinatorial Index", published by Academic Press, 1998. The use of solid-phase supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols known from the literature which, in turn, can be carried out manually or in an automated fashion. For example, the "teabag method" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. SciM 1985, 82, 5131 - 5135) can be partly automated with products of IRORI, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA<br><br>
92037, USA. Solid-phase supported parallel synthesis can be automated successfully for example using equipment by Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Feld 4, 58454 Witten, Germany.<br>
The preparation in accordance with the processes described herein yields compounds of formula (I) in the form of substance collections or substance libraries. Subject matter of the present invention are therefore also libraries of the compounds of formula (I) which contain at least two compounds of formula (I), and of their precursors.<br>
The following non-limiting Examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of formula (I).<br>

According to a further feature of the present invention, there is provided the use as a herbicide or plant growth regulator characterised in that the compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof is applied in an effective amount for the control of weeds or for regulating the growth of plants at a plant locus. For this purpose, the said compound is normally used in the form of a herbicidal composition (i.e. in association with compatible diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents suitable for use in herbicidal compositions), for example as hereinafter described. By application to the 'plant locus' is meant application, for example to the plant growing medium, such as soil, as well as to the seeds, emerging seedlings, roots, stems, leaves or other plant parts.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, all termed hereinbelow as compounds of formula (I), have an excellent herbicidal activity against a broad range of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants. The compounds of formula (I) also act efficiently on perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, root stocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to control. In this context, the substances can be applied pre-planting, pre-emergence or post-emergence.<br>
Specifically, examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the compounds of formula (I), without the enumeration being a restriction to certain species.<br><br>
Amongst the monocotyledonous weed species, those on which the active substances act efficiently are, for example, Agrostis, Alopecurus, Apera, Avena, Brachicaria, Bromus, Dactyloctenium, Digitaria, Echinochloa, Eleocharis, Eleusine, Festuca, Fimbristylis, Ischaemum, Lolium, Monochoria, Panicum, Paspalum, Phalaris, Phleum, Poa, Sagittaria, Scirpus, Setaria, Sphenoclea and Cyperus species from the annual group and, amongst the perennial species, Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum and also perennial Cyperus species. In the case of dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to species such as, for example, Galium, Viola, Veronica, Lamium, Stellaria, Amaranthus, Sinapis, Ipomoea, Matricaria, Abutilon and Sida amongst the annuals and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds. Herbicidal action is also achieved in the case of dicotyledonous harmful plants such as Ambrosia, Anthemis, Carduus, Centaurea, Chenopodium, Datura, Emex, Galeopsis, Galinsoga, Kochia, Lepidium, Lindernia, Papaver, Portlaca, Polygonum, Ranunculus, Rorippa, Rotala, Seneceio, Sesbania, Solanum, Sonchus, Taraxacum, Trifolium, Urtica and Xanthium.<br>
Harmful plants occurring under the specific cultivation conditions of rice, such as, for example, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus and Cyperus, are also well controlled by the active substances according to the invention.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention are applied to the soil surface before germination (pre-emergence of the weeds), then the weed seedlings are either prevented completely from emerging or the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage, but then their growth stops and they finally die completely after three to four weeks have elapsed.<br>
When the active substances are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth stops equally drastically a very short time after treatment and the weed plants remain at the stage of growth at the time of application, or they die completely after a certain time, so that in this manner competition by the weeds,<br><br>
which is harmful to the crop plants, is eliminated at a very early stage and in a sustained manner.<br>
Although the compounds according to the invention have an excellent herbicidal activity against mono- and dicotyledonous weeds, some crop plants of economically important crops such as, for example, wheat, barley, rye, triticale, rice, maize, sugar beet, cotton or soybeans (particularly wheat, barley, rice or maize) are damaged only to an insignificant extent or not at all, if an appropriate dosage is applied. For these reasons, the present compounds are in some cases suitable for the selective control of undesired vegetation in stands of agriculturally useful plants or in stands of ornamental plants.<br>
The activity allows to employ the compounds as effective herbicidal active ingredients pre- and post-emergence for controlling broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds at relatively low dosage as a selective herbicide in some crops (preferably pre-emergence of the weeds in many cases). Alternatively the compounds can be used effectively at some higher dosage for the control of a broad range of dicotyledonous weeds and monocotyledonous weeds in plantation crops and on uncultivated land and, by means of specific application techniques, also for inter-row treatment in agricultural row crops such as maize, cotton and the like.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be used to selectively control annual and perennial harmful plants in plantation crops such as oil palm, coconut palm, India-rubber tree, citrus, pineapples, pome, cotton, coffee, cocoa and the like, as well as in fruit production and viticulture. Equally, the combinations according to the invention can be employed in arable crop production using the no-till or zero-till method.<br>
Another object of the invention is thus the selective weed control in plantation crops by applying the compounds according to the invention as herbicides.<br><br>
Alternatively, they can be used as very effective herbicides in a non-selective manner on paths, open spaces and industrial sites and the like to keep these areas free from undesirable vegetation.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a long-term herbicidal action with a rapid onset.<br>
It is also possible to use the compounds (I) in combination with other pesticidally active substances or nutritients, such as, for example, insecticides, acaricides, herbicides, fungicides, safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators.<br>
The invention thus also relates to a method of controlling undesirable vegetation which comprises applying one or more type A herbicides together with one or more type B herbicides and a type C surfactant to the harmful plants, parts of these plants or the area under cultivation. Type A herbicides are the compounds of formula (I) or their salts; type B herbicides are other herbicides useful to be combined with compounds (I) for the purpose of broadening weed spectrum to be controlled, or increasing herbicidal effect (some possible type B herbicides are mentioned further below).<br>
In addition, the substances according to the invention have outstanding growth-regulatory properties in crop plants. They engage in the plants' metabolism in a regulatory fashion and can thus be employed for influencing plant constituents in a targeted fashion and for facilitating harvesting, such as, for example, by triggering desiccation and stunted growth. Moreover, they are also suitable for generally controlling and inhibiting undesired vegetative growth without simultaneously killing the plants. Inhibiting vegetative growth plays an important role in many monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops since lodging can be reduced, or prevented completely, hereby.<br>
Due to their herbicidal and plant-growth regulatory properties, the compounds of formula (I) can also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of known<br><br>
genetically modified plants, or genetically modified plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by particular advantageous properties, for example by resistances to certain pesticides, mainly certain herbicides, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as certain insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known where the starch content is increased or the starch quality is altered or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid spectrum.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are preferably employed in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, sorghum and millet, rice, cassava and maize, or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oil seed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other vegetables.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can preferably be employed as herbicides in crops of useful plants which are resistant to the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides or have been rendered thus by means of genetic engineering.<br>
Traditional ways of generating novel plants which have modified characteristics in comparison with existing plants consist, for example, in traditional breeding methods and the generation of mutants. However, it is also possible to generate novel plants with altered characteristics with the aid of genetic engineering methods (see, for example, EP-A-0221044, EP-A-0131624). For example, several cases have been described of<br>
genetic engineering modifications of crop plants with the purpose of modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (for example WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827, WO 91/19806),<br>
transgenic crop plants which are resistant to certain herbicides of the glufosinate type (cf., for example, EP-A-0242236, EP-A-242246) or the glyphosate type (WO 92/00377) or the sulfonylurea type (EP-A-0257993, US-A-5013659),<br><br>
transgenic crop plants, for example cotton, which are capable of producing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which make the plants resistant to specific pests (EP-A-0142924, EP-A-0193259),<br>
transgenic crop plants whose fatty acid spectrum is modified (WO 91/13972).<br>
A large number of techniques in molecular biology by means of which novel transgenic plants with altered characteristics can be generated are known in principle; see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; or Winnacker "Gene und Klone" [Genes and Clones], VCH Weinheim 2nd Edition 1996, or Christou, 'Trends in Plant Science" 1 (1996) 423-431).<br>
In order to perform such genetic engineering manipulations, nucleic acid molecules may be introduced into plasmids which allow mutagenesis or a sequence change by means of recombination of DNA sequences. It is possible, for example, with the aid of the abovementioned standard methods to perform base exchanges, to remove subsequences or to add natural or synthetic sequences. To connect the DNA fragments to each other, adaptors or linkers may be attached to the fragments.<br>
For example, plant cells with a reduced activity of a gene product can be generated by expressing at least one corresponding antisense RNA, a sense RNA to achieve a cosuppressory effect or by expressing at least one ribozyme of suitable construction which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product<br>
To this end it is possible to make use of, on the one hand, DNA molecules which encompass the entire coding sequence of a gene product inclusive of any flanking sequences which may be present, on the.other hand DNA molecules which only encompass parts of the coding sequence, but these parts must be long enough in order to effect, in the cells, an antisense effect. Use may also be made of DNA sequences which show a high degree of homology to the coding sequences of a gene product, but which are not completely identical.<br><br>
When nucleic add molecules are expressed in plants, the protein which has been synthesized may be located in any desired compartment of the plant cell. However, to achieve localization in a particular compartment, it is possible, for example, to link the coding region with DNA sequences which guarantee localization in a particular compartment. Such sequences are known to the skilled worker (see, for example, Braun et aL, EMBO J. 11 (1992), 3219-3227; Wolter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988), 846-850; Sonnewald et al., Plant J. 1 (1991), 95-106).<br>
The transgenic plant cells may be regenerated by known techniques to give complete plants. In principle, the transgenic plants can be plants of any desired plant species, that is to say monocotyledonous and also dicotyledonous plants.<br>
This allows transgenic plants to be obtained which exhibit altered characteristics by means of overexpression, suppression or inhibition of homologous (= natural) genes or gene sequences or by means of expression of heterologous (= foreign) genes or gene sequences.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can preferably be employed in transgenic crops which are resistant to herbicides from the group of the sulfonylureas, glufosinate-ammonium or glyphosate-isopropylammonium and analogous active substances.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are used in transgenic crops, effects other than the herbicidal effects to be observed in other crops are frequently found which are specific for application in the particular transgenic crop, for example an altered or specifically widened weed spectrum which can be controlled, altered application rates which may be employed for application, preferably good combining ability with the herbicides to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and an effect on growth and yield of the transgenic crop plants.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I) as herbicides for controlling harmful plants in transgenic crop plants.<br><br>
The use according to the invention for controlling harmful plants or for regulating the growth of plants also includes the case where the compounds of formula (I) are only formed in the plant or the soil from a precursor ("prodrug") after its application to the plant.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be employed in the conventional preparations as wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, sprayable solutions, dusts or granules. The invention therefore also relates to herbicidal and plant-growth-regulating compositions which comprise compounds of formula (I).<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention, there is provided a herbicidal or plant growth regulating composition comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as defined above or an agriculturally acceptable salt thereof, in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in, one or more compatible agriculturally- acceptable diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents [i.e. diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents of the type generally accepted in the art as being suitable for use in herbicidal compositions and which are compatible with compounds of the invention]. The term "homogeneously dispersed" is used to include compositions in which the compounds of formula (I) are dissolved in other components. The term "herbicidal compositions" is used in a broad sense to include not only compositions which are ready for use as herbicides but also concentrates which must be diluted before use (including tank mixtures).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. Examples of possible formulations which are suitable are: wettable powders (WP), water-soluble powders (SP), water-soluble concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), emulsions (EW) such as oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions, suspension concentrates (SC), dispersions on an oil or water basis, solutions which are miscible with oil, capsule suspensions (CS), dusts (DP), seed-dressing products, granules for broadcasting and soil application, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray<br><br>
granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), water-soluble granules (SG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes.<br>
These individual formulation types are known in principle and described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. HauserVerlag, Munich, 4th Edition 1986; Wade van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker, N.YM 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The necessary formulation auxiliaries such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives are also known and described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry", 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; C. Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Sch6nfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag, Munich, 4th Ed. 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations, it is also possible to prepare combinations with other pesticidally active substances such as, for example, insecticides, acaricides, herbicides, fungicides, and with safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a readymix or a tank mix.<br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the compounds of formula (I), also comprise ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (wetters, dispersants), for example, polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ether sulfates, alkanesulfonates or alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate, sodium 2,2,-dinaphthylmethane-6,6,-disulfonate, sodium<br><br>
dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate, in addition to a diluent or inert substance. To prepare the wettable powders, the compounds of formula (I) are, for example, ground finely in conventional apparatuses such as hammer mills, blower mills and air-jet mills and mixed with the formulation auxiliaries, either concomitantly or thereafter.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared, for example, by dissolving the compounds of formula (I) in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons or mixtures of these, with addition of one or more ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (emulsifiers). Emulsifiers which can be used are, for example: calcium salts of alkylarylsulfonic acids, such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan esters such as sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained by grinding the active substance with finely divided solid substances, for example talc or natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite or pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Suspension concentrates may be water- or oil-based. They can be prepared, for example, by wet grinding by means of commercially available bead mills, if appropriate with addition of surfactants, as they have already been mentioned above for example in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Emulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be prepared for example by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixtures using aqueous organic solvents and, if appropriate, surfactants as they have already been mentioned above for example in the case of the other formulation types.<br><br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the compounds of formula (I) onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active substance concentrates onto the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or of granulated inert material, by means of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or alternatively mineral oils. Suitable active substances can also be granulated in the manner which is conventional for the production of fertilizer granules, if desired in a mixture with fertilizers.<br>
Water-dispersible granules are prepared, as a rule, by the customary processes such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing in high-speed mixers and extrusion without solid inert material. To prepare disk, fluidized-bed, extruder and spray granules, see, for example, processes in "Spray-Drying Handbook" 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd., London; J.E. Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical and Engineering 1967, pages 147 et seq.; "Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook", 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York 1973, p. 8-57.<br>
For further details on the formulation of crop protection products, see, for example, G.C. Klingman, "Weed Control as a Science", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1961, pages 81-96 and J.D. Freyer, SA Evans, "Weed Control Handbook", 5th Ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1968, pages 101-103.<br>
As a rule, the agrochemical preparations comprise 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particulai 0.1 to 95% by weight, of compounds of formula (I).<br>
The concentration of compounds of formula (I) in wettable powders is, for example, approximately 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the concentration of compounds of formula (I) can amount to approximately 1 to 90, preferably 5 to 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts usually comprise 1 to 30% by weight of compounds of formula (I), preferably in most cases 5 to 20% by weight of compounds of formula (I), while sprayable solutions comprise approximately 0.05 to 80, preferably 2 to 50% by weight of compounds of formula (I). In the case of water-dispersible granules, the content of<br><br>
compounds of formula (I) depends partly on whether the compounds of formula (I) are in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliaries, fillers and the like are being used. The water-dispersible granules, for example, comprise between 1 and 95% by weight of active substance, preferably between 10 and 80% by weight.<br>
In addition, the formulations of compounds of formula (I) mentioned comprise, if appropriate, the adhesives, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, preservatives, antifreeze agents, solvents, fillers, carriers, colorants, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors, pH regulators and viscosity regulators which are conventional in each case.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) or their salts can be employed as such or in the form of their preparations (formulations) as combinations with other pesticidally active substances, such as, for example, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, herbicides, fungicides, safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example as a premix or as tank mixes.<br>
Components which may be employed for the active substances according to the invention in mixed formulations or in tank mix are, for example, known active compounds which are based on an inhibition of, for example, acetolactate synthase, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, PS I, PS II, HPPDO, phytoene desaturase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, glutamine synthetase, cellulose biosynthesis, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthetase. Such compounds, and also other compounds which can be employed, whose mechanism of action is to a degree unknown or different, are described, for example, in Weed Research 26,441-445 (1986), or "The Pesticide Manual", 12th Edition 2000 (hereinbelow also abbreviated to "PM"), The British Crop Protection Council and the Royal Soc. of Chemistry (editors), including the e-Pesticide Manual Version 2.2 (2002), and literature cited therein.

Controlling harmful plants selectively is of particular interest in crops of useful plants and ornamentals. Even though the compounds (I) already exhibit very good to sufficient selectivity in many crops, it is possible, in principle, that symptoms of phytotoxicity occur on the cultivated plants in some crops and especially also in the case of mixtures with other herbicides which are less selective. In this respect, combinations of compounds (I) according to the invention which are of particular interest are those which contain the compounds (I) or their combinations with other herbicides or pesticides and safeners. The safeners, which are employed in such an amount that they act as antidote, reduce the phytotoxic side effects of the herbicides/pesticides employed, for example in economically important crops such as cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize, rice, sorghum and millet), sugar beet, sugar cane, oilseed rape, cotton and soybeans, preferably cereals.

active substances which, in addition to a herbicidal action against harmful<br>
plants, also exhibit a safener action in connection with crop plants such as<br>
rice, such as, for example,<br>
"dimepiperate" or "MY-93" (PM, pp. 302-303) (= S-1-methyl-1-phenylethyl<br>
piperidine-1-carbothioate), which is known as safenerfor rice against damage<br>
by the herbicide molinate,<br>
"daimuron" or "SK 23" (PM, p. 247) (= 1-(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)-3-p-<br>
tolylurea), which is known as safener for rice against damage by the herbicide<br>
imazosulfuron,<br><br>
"cumyluron" = "JC-940" (= 3"(2-chlorophenyImethyl)-1-(1-methyl-1-phenyi-ethyl)urea, see JP-A-60087254), which is known as safener for rice against damage by several herbicides,<br>
"methoxyphenone" or"NK 049" (= S.S'-dimethy-4-methoxybenzophenone), which is known as safener for rice against damage by several herbicides, "CSB" (= 1-bromo-4-(chloromethylsulfonyl)benzene) (CAS Reg. No. 54091-06-4, by Kumiai), which is known as safener in rice against damage by several herbicides; p)       N-acylsuIfonamides of the formula (S3) and their salts<br><br>
q)       acylsulfamoylbenzamides of the formula (S4), if appropriate also in salt form,<br><br>
as are described in International Application No. PCT/EP98/06097; and r)        compounds of the formula (S5),<br><br>
as are described in WO-A 98/13 361.<br>
including the stereoisomers and the salts conventionally used in agriculture.<br><br>
Amongst the safeners mentioned, those which are of particular interest are (S1-1) and (S1-9) and (S2-1), in particular (S1-1) and (S1-9).<br>
Some of the safeners are already known as herbicides and therefore simultaneously also display a protective action in connection with the crop plants in addition to the herbicidal action in connection with harmful plants.<br>
The weight ratio of herbicide (mixture) to safener generally depends on the application rate of herbicide and the efficacy of the safener in question; it can vary within wide limits, for example in the range of from 200:1 to 1:200, preferably from 100:1 to 1:100, in particular 20:1 to 1:20. The safeners can be formulated with furthe herbicides/pesticides, analogously to the compounds (I) or their mixtures, and provided and used as readymix or tank mix together with the herbicides.<br>
For use, the herbicide or herbicide safener formulations, which are present in a customary commercial form, are, if appropriate, diluted in the customary fashion, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, soil granules, granules for spreading, and sprayable solutions, are usually not diluted further with other inert materials prior to use.<br>
The application rate required of the compounds of the formula (I) varies with, inter alia, the external conditions such as temperature, humidity and the type of the herbicide used. It can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.001 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but it is preferably between 0.002 and 3 kg/ha, in particular 0.005 and 1 kg/ha.<br><br>
