According to the present invention the isolation of the products is performed by means of conventional extraction processes from alkaline aqueous solutions by the use of halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform or tetrachloro-methane, followed by evaporation to a dry residue.<br>
The course of the reaction is followed by chromatography on a thin layer of silica gel (Merck 60 F254) in solvent systems methylene chloride-methanol-ammonium hydroxide 25% (90:9:1.5, system A), (90:9:0.5, system Al) or methylene chloride-acetone (8:2, system B) (7:3, system C). If appropriate, the separation of the reaction products and the purification of the products for the purpose of spectral analyses are performed on a silica gel column (Merck 60, 230-400 mesh/ASTM, or 60-230 mesh/ASTM in solvent systems A, B or C). The identification of the novel compounds is performed by UV and NMR spectroscopies and by mass analysis.<br>
