				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an ethylene polymer which has excellent fluidity and moldability, and also gives a molded product having excellent properties such as mechanical strength, and to a molded product obtained therefrom.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
High-density polyethylene which is used in wide applications such as films, pipes, and bottle containers, has been conventionally prepared by using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst or a chromium catalyst. However, because of the nature of such catalysts, there has been limitation on the control of the molecular weight distribution or composition distribution of the polymer.<br>
In recent years, several methods have been disclosed for preparation of an ethylene polymer having excellent moldability and mechanical strength, including an ethylene homopolymer or an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer of relatively small molecular weights and an ethylene homopolymer or an ethylene/a-olefin copolymer of a relatively large molecular weight, according to<br>
a continuous polymerization technique using a single-site<br>
catalyst which facilitates the control of the composition<br>
distribution.<br>
JP-A No. 11-106432 discloses a composition prepared by<br>
melt-blending a low molecular weight polyethylene with a high<br>
molecular weight ethylene/a-olefin copolymer which is obtained<br>
by polymerization using a supported geometric constraint type<br>
single-site catalyst (CGC/Borate-based catalyst). However it<br>
is expected that sufficient mechanical strength would not be<br>
exhibited in the case of the carbon number being less than 6<br>
according to the method disclosed in the above-mentioned patent<br>
application. Further because the molecular weight<br>
distribution (Mw/Mn) of the single-stage polymerization product<br>
is broad it is also expected that the mechanical properties of<br>
the product such as impact strength would be insufficient as<br>
compared with the single-stage product having a narrower<br>
molecular weight distribution.<br>
WO 01/25328 discloses an ethylene polymer which is obtained<br>
by solution polymerization in the presence of a catalyst system<br>
comprising CpTiNP(tBu) 3C12 and borate or alumoxane. This<br>
ethylene polymer has a weak crystalline structure due to the<br>
presence of branches in the low molecular weight component and<br>
thus it is expected that the polymer has poor mechanical strength.<br>
EP 1201711 Al discloses an ethylene polymer which is<br>
obtained by slurry polymerization in the presence of a catalyst<br>
system comprising ethylene<br>
bis(4567-tetrahydro-l-indenyl)zirconium dichloride and<br>
methylalumoxane supported on silica. Among these ethylene<br>
polymers a single-stage polymerization product has a wide<br>
molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) and thus it is expected<br>
that it would have insufficient impact strength and the like<br>
as compared with a single-stage product of a narrower molecular<br>
weight distribution. Further it is inferred that a broad<br>
molecular weight distribution means heterogeneity of the active<br>
species and consequently there is a concern that the composition<br>
distribution broadens thereby resulting in deterioration of<br>
long lifetime properties such as environmental stress cracking<br>
resistance (ESCR).<br>
JP-A No. 2002-53615 discloses an ethylene polymer which is<br>
obtained by slurry polymerization using a catalyst system<br>
comprising methylalumoxane and a zirconium compound having a<br>
specific salicylaldimine ligand supported on silica. Although<br>
the patent application does not disclose the preferred range of<br>
the carbon number of a-olefin that is to be copolymerized with<br>
ethylene in regard to the ethylene polymer obtained from<br>
1-butene (number of carbon atoms=4) which is used as the a-olefin<br>
in Examples of the patent application the carbon number<br>
envisaged to be too small to exhibit a sufficient mechanical<br>
strength.<br>
The ethylene (co)polymer prepared using a Ziegler catalyst<br>
as described in Japanese Patent No. 821037 or the like has methyl<br>
branches in the molecular chain as a result of side production<br>
of methyl branches during the polymerization. It was found that<br>
these methyl branches were embedded in the crystal thus<br>
weakening the crystal and this caused deterioration of<br>
mechanical strength of the ethylene (co)polymer. Further in<br>
regard to the copolymer of ethylene and an a-olefin when the<br>
copolymer contained almost no a-olefin a hard but brittle<br>
component was produced while when an excessive amount of<br>
a-olefin was subject to copolymerization a soft component with<br>
weak crystalline structure was produced and thus it may cause<br>
tackiness due to broad composition distribution. Moreover<br>
since the molecular weight distribution was broad there were<br>
problems such as the phenomenon that a low molecular weight<br>
polymer adheres onto the surface of a molded product as a powdery<br>
substance and so on.<br>
The ethylene polymer that is obtained by polymerization<br>
using a metallocene catalyst as described in JP-A No. 9-183816<br>
or the like causes side production of methyl branches during the<br>
polymerization thereby lowering the mechanical strength.<br>
An ethylene polymer which is obtained by polymerization<br>
using a chromium catalyst exhibits small extension of molecular<br>
chain because of the presence of a long chain branch and thus<br>
has poor mechanical strength and long lifetime properties such<br>
as environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR). Further<br>
as a result of side production of a methyl branch during the<br>
polymerization there exist methyl branch groups in the molecular<br>
chain. This has been a cause for lowering the mechanical<br>
strength.<br>
The ethylene polymer which is obtained by polymerization<br>
using a constrained geometry catalyst (CGC) as described in WO<br>
93/08221 or the like has methyl branches in the molecular chain<br>
as a result of side production of a methyl branch during the<br>
polymerization. These methyl branches are embedded in the<br>
crystals and thus weaken the crystalline structure. This has<br>
been a cause for lowering the mechanical strength. Further the<br>
molecular extension of molecular chain was small because of the<br>
presence of long chain branches and thus the mechanical strength<br>
and long lifetime properties such as environmental stress<br>
cracking resistance (ESCR) were insufficient.<br>
An ethylene polymer which is obtained by high pressure<br>
radical polymerization has methyl branches or long chain branches<br>
in the molecular chain as a result of side production of methyl<br>
branches or long chain branches during polymerization. These<br>
methyl branches are embedded in the crystals thereby weakening<br>
the crystalline strength. This has been a cause for lowering<br>
the mechanical strength. Further the presence of long chain<br>
branches resulted in small extension of molecular chain as well<br>
as a broad molecular weight distribution and thus the long<br>
lifetime properties such as environmental stress cracking<br>
resistance (ESCR) were poor.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter the present invention will be described one<br>
after another regarding the ethylene polymer (E)  the ethylene<br>
polymer (Eb) which is suitably used for blow molding and the<br>
ethylene polymer (Ee) which is suitably used for extrusion or<br>
injection molding and then the blow molded product the<br>
extrusion molded product the compression molded product or the<br>
vacuum molded product made from the ethylene polymer (E) the<br>
ethylene polymer (Eb) or the ethylene polymer (Ee) will be<br>
described.<br>
Ethylene Polymer (E)<br>
The ethylene polymer (E) according to the present invention<br>
is an ethylene polymer which contains 0.02 to 1.50 mol% of a<br>
constitutional unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms and usually comprises homopolymers of ethylene and<br>
copolymers of ethylene/a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
11<br>
Herein examples of a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
(hereinafter may be simply referred to as "a-olefin") include<br>
1-hexene 4-methyl-l-pentene 3-methyl-l-pentene 1-octene<br>
and 1-decene. According to the invention it is preferred to<br>
use at least one selected from 1-hexene 4-methyl-l-pentene and<br>
1-octene among such a-olefins. When the a-olefin has 5 or less<br>
carbon atoms the probability of the a-olefin being incorporated<br>
into the crystals increases (see Polymer Vol. 31 p. 1999 (1990) ) <br>
and consequently the strength is weakened which is not desirable.<br>
When the a-olefin has more than 10 carbon atoms the activation<br>
energy for fluidity becomes larger and there occurs a large<br>
change in viscosity during molding which is not desirable. Also<br>
when the a-olefin has more than 10 carbon atoms the side chain<br>
(the branch originating from the a-olefin copolymerized with<br>
ethylene) may sometimes undergo crystallization thereby<br>
resulting in weakening of the non-crystalline part which is not<br>
desirable.<br>
The constitutional unit derived from a-olefin is contained<br>
in an amount of usually 0.02 to 1.50 mol% and preferably 0.02<br>
to 1.30 mol%. More preferable concentration varies according<br>
to the applications in which the ethylene polymer is used (the<br>
details of which will be described later).<br>
The ethylene polymer (E) according to the present invention<br>
satisfies the following requirements [1] and [2] simultaneously<br>
12<br>
for the cross fractionation chromatography (CFG).<br>
Requirement [1]<br>
The ethylene polymer (E) according to the invention is<br>
characterized in that all the components having a molecular<br>
weight of 100000 or more are eluted at 85°C or higher in cross<br>
fractionation chromatography (CFG). Now the requirement [1]<br>
will be specifically described with reference to the results<br>
described in Examples. As determined by the CFG analysis of the<br>
ethylene polymer employed in Example 2b described later the<br>
temperature at which the component having a molecular weight (M)<br>
of 100000 or more (that is LogM  5.0) starts eluting is 94°C<br>
which satisfies the requirement [1]. The blow molded product<br>
made from the ethylene polymer exhibits good environmental stress<br>
cracking resistance (ESCR) as show in Table 3b. On the other hand<br>
as determined by the CFC analysis of the ethylene polymer employed<br>
in Comparative Example It the temperature at which the component<br>
having a molecular weight (M) of 100000 or more (that is LogM<br>
 5.0) starts eluting is 83°C which does not satisfy the<br>
requirement [1] . The blow molded product made from the ethylene<br>
polymer exhibits poorer balance between the stiffness (flexural<br>
modulus) and the environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR)<br>
as compared with the ethylene polymer of Example 2b as shown in<br>
Table 3b. That is it was found that it is essential that the<br>
ethylene polymer of the present invention should satisfy the<br>
13<br>
requirement [1] in order to provide a molded product with<br>
excellent performances such as stiffness and fluidity and good<br>
balance of the long lifetime property therewith. In order to<br>
provide a molded product with performances such as stiffness and<br>
fluidity and good balance of the long lifetime property<br>
therewith it is preferable that the ethylene polymer of the<br>
present invention should satisfy the following requirement [2]<br>
in addition to the requirement [1].<br>
Requirement [2]<br>
The ethylene polymer (E) according to the present invention<br>
is characterized in that 5% or less of all the components are<br>
eluted at 80°C or lower in cross fractionation chromatography<br>
(CFC). (Here "%" refers to the percentage of the total area<br>
of the peak attributable to the components eluted at 80°C or lower<br>
relative to the total area of the peak attributable to all the<br>
components). Now the requirement [2] will be specifically<br>
described with reference to the results described in Examples.<br>
As determined by the CFC analysis of the ethylene polymer employed<br>
in Example 2b described later the proportion of the components<br>
eluted at 80°C or lower in the all the components is 1.9% which<br>
satisfies the requirement [2] . The blow molded product made from<br>
the ethylene polymer exhibits good balance between the stiffness<br>
(flexural modulus bucking strength) and the environmental<br>
stress cracking resistance (ESCR) as show in Table 3b and 4b. On<br>
14<br>
the other hand as determined by the CFC analysis of the ethylene<br>
polymer employed in Comparative Example lb the proportion of<br>
the components eluted at 80°C or lower in the all the components<br>
is 7.1% which does not satisfy the requirement [2]. The blow<br>
molded product made from the ethylene polymer exhibits poorer<br>
balance between the stiffness (flexural modulus bucking<br>
strength) and the environmental stress cracking resistance<br>
(ESCR) as compared with the ethylene polymer of Example 2b as<br>
show in Table 3b and 4b. (Moreover with reference to the<br>
requirements [1] and [2] the difference of the ethylene polymers<br>
as described in Example 2b and Comparative Example lb can be<br>
understood qualitatively from the CFC contour diagram of Figs.<br>
1 and 2.)<br>
It is meant by the ethylene polymer satisfying the<br>
requirements [1] and [2] that the a-olefin content of the high<br>
molecular weight components having a copolymerized a-olefin is<br>
small and the composition of a-olefin is uniform or that the<br>
polymer does not contain any of such components which have<br>
relatively small molecular weights and also a short chain branch.<br>
In this case a product molded therefrom is improved in long-term<br>
properties and the mechanical strength. The ethylene/a-olefin<br>
copolymer as described in JP-A No. 11-106432 has a wide<br>
composition distribution and thus does not satisfy the<br>
above-mentioned scope. The ethylene polymer as described in WO<br>
15<br>
01/25328 does not satisfy the above-mentioned scope because even<br>
a component with relatively small molecular weight also has a<br>
short chain branch resulting from copolymerization with an<br>
a-olefin.<br>
The ethylene polymers of prior art prepared in the presence<br>
of a Ziegler catalyst or a chromium catalyst also have wide<br>
composition distributions and thus do not satisfy the<br>
above-mentioned scope. By setting the polymerization<br>
conditions as described later and using a catalyst system as<br>
described later an ethylene polymer satisfying the requirements<br>
[1] and [2] can be prepared. Preferred examples of the ethylene<br>
polymers (E) can be mainly categorized to two types of the ethylene<br>
polymers i.e. the ethylene polymer (Eb) which is suitably used<br>
for blow molding and the ethylene polymer (Ee) which is suitably<br>
used for extrusion or injection molding. "Suitably used for a<br>
specific application" means that the substances fully exhibit<br>
their performances according to the present invention in the<br>
specific application without limitation by other fields than<br>
the application field.<br>
Ethylene polymer (Eb)<br>
The ethylene polymer (Eb) is an ethylene polymer which<br>
satisfies in addition to the above-mentioned requirements [1]<br>
and [2] the following requirements [Ib] to [4b] and is<br>
preferably used for blow molding.<br>
16<br>
Requirement [Ib]<br>
The ethylene polymer (Eb) usually contains 0 . 02 to 0. 50 mol%<br>
of a constitutional unit derived from a-olefin having 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms. When the ethylene polymer (Eb) does not contain<br>
ethylene homopolymers that is when the polymer consists only<br>
of copolymers of ethylene and a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
it is desirable that the constitutional unit derived from<br>
ethylene is present in a proportion of usually 99.50 to 99.98<br>
mol% preferably 99.80 to 99.98 mol% and the repeating unit<br>
derived from the a-olefin is present in a proportion of usually<br>
0.02 to 0.50 mol% preferably 0.02 to 0.20 mol%. And the<br>
ethylene polymer (Eb) may occasionally contain ethylene<br>
homopolymers and in this case it is desirable that the<br>
constitutional unit derived from ethylene in the<br>
ethylene/a-olefin copolymer part is present in a proportion of<br>
usually 97.50 to 99.96 mol% preferably 99 to 99.96 mol% and<br>
the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is present in a<br>
proportion of usually 0.04 to 2.50 mol% preferably 0.04 to 1.00<br>
mol%. Here even in the case of containing ethylene homopolymers<br>
the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is present in a<br>
proportion of usually 0.02 to 0.50 mol% preferably 0.02 to 0.40<br>

Requirement [2b]<br>
The intrinsic viscosity ( [r|] ) of the ethylene polymer (Eb)<br>
17<br>
of the present invention as measured in decalin at 135°C is in<br>
the range of 1.6 to 2.8 dl/g and preferably from 1.8 to 2.8 dl/g.<br>
The ethylene polymer having its intrinsic viscosity within these<br>
ranges is excellent in mechanical strength moldability and the<br>
environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR). For example<br>
by changing the ratio of the amounts of hydrogen ethylene and<br>
a-olefin fed to the polymerization reactor the ratio of the<br>
polymerization amounts of ethylene homopolymer to<br>
ethylene/a-olefin copolymer or the like the values of intrinsic<br>
viscosity can be increased or decreased within the<br>
above-mentioned numerical ranges. Specifically in the slurry<br>
polymerization of Example 2b using hexane as a solvent when<br>
polymerization is carried out under stirring to render the system<br>
homogeneous the density and [TI] become 962 kg/m3 and 2.15 dl/g<br>
respectively; when ethylene hydrogen and 1-hexene are fed to<br>
the second polymerization reactor at the rates of 4.3 kg/hr 3.0<br>
N-liter/hr and 26 g/hr respectively the density and [T]] become<br>
967 kg/m3 and 2.10 dl/g respectively; and when ethylene and<br>
hydrogen are fed to the first polymerization reactor at the rates<br>
of 7.0 kg/hr and 40 N-liters/hr respectively and ethylene<br>
hydrogen and 1-hexene are fed to the second polymerization<br>
reactor at the rates of 3.8 kg/hr 4.5 N-liter/hr and 180 g/hr<br>
respectively the density and [r|] become 954 kg/m3 and 2.43 dl/g<br>
respectively.Requirement [3b] The ethylene polymer (Eb) according to the present invention has a flexural modulus, MPa, as measured at 23°C according to ASTM-D-790 which satisfies 600 ≤ M 
T≥-0.8XM+1,210   (Eq-1).<br>
Such the ethylene polymer is stiff and tough, and thus the molded article obtained therefrom can be made thinner than conventional ones upon use. When multistage polymerization as described later is carried out using a catalyst system as described later, an ethylene polymer falling in the above range can be prepared by changing the proportions of hydrogen, ethylene and α-olefin fed to the polymerization reactor and thereby controlling the molecular weights and the proportions of polymerized amounts of the respective components. Specifically, when an ethylene polymer which has been polymerized under the conditions as described in Example 4b, the flexural modulus obtained is 1, 490 MPa, and the ESCR is 177 hours up to 50% failure, or when the amount of hydrogen fed to the first polymerization reactor is changed from 75 N-liter/hr to 70 N-liter/hr, the amount of hydrogen fed to the second polymerization reactor is changed from 3. 0 N-liter/hr to 4 .0 N-liter/hr, and the amount of 1-hexene fed to the second polymerization reactor is changed from 52 g/hr<br>
to 65 g/hr under the conditions as described in Example 4t the<br>
f lexural modulus becomes 1410 MPa and the ESCR becomes 188 hours<br>
up to 50% failure.<br>
Requirements [4b]<br>
The ethylene polymer (Eb) according to the present<br>
invention preferably has a tan8 (loss modulus G' ' /storage modulus<br>
G') as measured at 190°C and at an angular frequency of 100 rad/sec<br>
using a dynamic viscoelasticity measuring apparatus in the range<br>
of 0.6 to 0.9. When tan8 falls within this range the<br>
pinch-weldability of the blow molded product is excellent. As<br>
the molecular weight of the low molecular weight ethylene polymer<br>
is increased and as the molecular weight of the high molecular<br>
weight ethylene/a-olefin copolymer is decreased or total<br>
molecular weight is decreased tan8 tends to increase. Here<br>
pinch-weldability refers to the ability of a resin being well<br>
attached to the welded parts with a bulge when molten resin<br>
extruded in the shape of tube from an extruder is welded between<br>
the molds . Larger tan8 means stronger viscosity and in this case<br>
the resin is thought to be susceptible to bulging.<br>
Ethylene polymer (Ee)<br>
The ethylene polymer (Ee) is an ethylene polymer which<br>
satisfies in addition to the above-mentioned requirements [1]<br>
and [2] the following requirements [le] to [5e] and is<br>
20<br>
preferably used for extrusion or injection molding.<br>
Requirement [le]<br>
The ethylene polymer (Ee) usually contains 0 . 02 to 1. 20 mol%<br>

when the polymer consists only of copolymers of ethylene and<br>
a-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms it is desirable that the<br>

99.80 mol% and the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is<br>
present in a proportion of usually 0.02 to 1.2 mol% preferably<br>
0.02 to 1.00 mol%. And the ethylene polymer (Ee) may<br>
occasionally contain ethylene homopolymers and in this case<br>
it is desirable that the constitutional unit derived from<br>
ethylene in the ethylene/a-olefin copolymer part is present in<br>
a proportion of usually 95 to 99.96 mol% preferably 97 . 5 to 99. 96<br>
mol% and the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is present<br>
in a proportion of usually 0.04 to 5.00 mol% preferably 0.04<br>
to 2.50 mol%. Here even in the case of containing ethylene<br>
homopolymers the repeating unit derived from the a-olefin is<br>
present in a proportion of usually 0.02 to 1.20 mol% preferably<br>
0.02 to 1.00 mol% based on the total polymer.<br>

The ethylene polymer having its density and intrinsic viscosity<br>
within these ranges is excellent in fluidity and mechanical<br>
strength and the balance of stiffness and moldability. For<br>
example by changing the ratio of the amounts of hydrogen<br>
ethylene and a-olefin fed to the polymerization reactor the<br>
ratio of the polymerization amounts of ethylene homopolymer to<br>
ethylene/a-olefin copolymer or the like the values can be<br>
increased or decreased within the above-mentioned numerical<br>
ranges. Specifically in the slurry polymerization of Example<br>
3e using hexane as a solvent when polymerization is carried out<br>
under stirring to render the system homogeneous the density and<br>
[T]] become 954 kg/m3 and 2.49 dl/g respectively; when ethylene<br>
hydrogen and 1-hexene are fed to the second polymerization<br>
reactor at the rates of 3.8 kg/hr 4.0 N-liter/hr and 180 g/hr<br>
respectively the density and [r\] become 954 kg/m3 and 2.85 dl/g<br>
respectively; and when ethylene and hydrogen are fed to the first<br>
polymerization reactor at the rates of 5.0 kg/hr and 65<br>
N-liters/hr respectively and ethylene hydrogen and 1-hexene<br>
are fed to the second polymerization reactor at the rates of 3.9<br>
kg/hr 1.2 N-liter/hr and 110 g/hr respectively the density<br>
and [r|] become 958 kg/m3 and 3.21 dl/g respectively.<br>

invention has an actual stress obtained when it takes 10000<br>

Component (B-2) which is optionally employed is used in an<br>
amount such that the molar ratio [ (B-2)/M] of the aluminum atom<br>
in component (B-2) to the transition metal atom (M) in Component<br>
(A) would be typically from 10 to 500000 and preferably from<br>
20 to 100000.<br>
Component (B-3) which is optionally employed is used in an<br>
amount such that the molar ratio [(B-3)/M] of component (B-3)<br>
to the transition metal atom (M) in Component (A) would be<br>
typically from 1 to 100 and preferably from 2 to 80.<br>
Component (D) which is optionally employed is used in an<br>
amount such that when Component (B) is component (B-l)  the molar<br>
ratio [(D)/(B-1)] would be typically from 0.01 to 10 preferably<br>
from 0.1 to 5 and when Component (B) is component (B-2) the<br>
molar ratio [(D)/(B-2)] would be typically from 0.001 to 2 and<br>
preferably from 0.005 to 1 and when Component (B) is component<br>
37<br>
(B-3) the molar ratio [(D)/(B-3)] would be typically from 0.01<br>
to 10 and preferably from 0.1 to 5.<br>
The temperature is typically in the range of -50 to 250°C<br>
preferably 0 to 200°C and particularly preferably 60 to 170°C.<br>
The polymerization pressure is typically from atmospheric<br>
pressure to 100 kg/cm2 and preferably from atmospheric pressure<br>
to 50 kg/cm2 and the polymerization reaction can be carried out<br>
in either of the batch mode semi-continuous mode and continuous<br>
mode. Polymerization is usually carried out in a gas phase or<br>
in a slurry phase in which polymer particles are precipitated<br>
out in a solvent. Furthermore polymerization is carried out<br>
in two or more stages with different reaction conditions. In<br>
this case it is preferably carried out in the batch mode. Also<br>
in the case of slurry polymerization or gas phase polymerization<br>
the polymerization temperature is preferably from 60 to 90°C<br>
and more preferably from 65 to 85°C. By carrying out the<br>
polymerization within this temperature range an ethylene<br>
polymer with narrower composition distribution can be obtained.<br>
A polymer obtained as such is in the form of a particle with a<br>
diameter of tens to thousands of ^im|). In the case of<br>
polymerization in the continuous mode in two or more<br>
polymerization reactors an operation such as precipitation in<br>
a poor solvent after dissolution in a good solvent sufficient<br>
melt-kneading in a specific kneader or the like is required.<br>
38<br>
When the ethylene polymer according to the present<br>
invention is prepared for example in two stages an ethylene<br>
homopolymer having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.3 to 1.8 dl/g is<br>
prepared in the former stage and a (co)polymer having an<br>
intrinsic viscosity of 3.0 to 10.0 dl/g is prepared in the later<br>
stage. This order may be reversed.<br>
Since the catalyst for olefin polymerization has extremely<br>
high polymerization performance even for the a-olefin (e.g.<br>
1-hexene) to be copolymerized with ethylene there would be<br>
needed a device not to produce a copolymer with excessively high<br>
a-olefin content after completion of predetermined<br>
polymerization. For example mention may be made of methods such<br>
as when the contents of the polymerization reactor is withdrawn<br>
from the polymerization reactor simultaneously or as<br>
immediately as possible (i) separating the polymer solvent and<br>
unreacted a-olefin with a solvent separator (ii) adding an inert<br>
gas such as nitrogen and the like to the contents compulsorily<br>
to discharge the solvent and unreacted a-olefin out of the system<br>
(iii) controlling the pressure applied to the contents<br>
compulsorily to discharge the solvent and unreacted a-olefin out<br>
of the system (iv) adding a large quantity of solvent to the<br>
contents to dilute the unreacted a-olefin to a concentration at<br>
which substantially no polymerization takes place (v) adding<br>
a substance which deactivates the catalyst for polymerization<br>
39<br>
such as methanol and the like (vi) cooling the contents to a<br>
temperature at which substantially no polymerization takes place<br>
or the like. These methods may be carried out independently or<br>
in combination of several methods.<br>
The molecular weight of the obtained ethylene polymer can<br>
be controlled by adding hydrogen to the polymerization system<br>
or by changing the polymerization temperature. It can be also<br>
controlled by means of the difference in components (B) used.<br>
The polymer particles obtained by polymerization reaction<br>
may be pelletized by the following methods:<br>
(1) a method of mechanically blending the ethylene polymer<br>
particles with other components that are optionally added in an<br>
extruder a kneader or the like and cutting into predetermined<br>
sizes; and<br>
(2) a method of dissolving the ethylene polymer and other<br>
components that are optionally added in a suitable good solvent<br>
(e.g. hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane heptane decane<br>
cyclohexane benzene toluene xylene and the like)<br>
subsequently removing the solvent then mechanically blending<br>
the components using an extruder a kneader or the like and<br>
cutting into predetermined sizes.<br>
The ethylene polymer according to the present invention may<br>
be blended as desired with additives such as a<br>
weather-resistant stabilizer a heat-resistant stabilizer<br>
40<br>
antistatic agent an anti-slipping agent an anti-blocking agent<br>
an anti-fogging agent a lubricant a dye a nucleating agent<br>
a plasticizer an anti-aging agent a hydrochloric acid absorbent<br>
an anti-oxidizing agent and the like pigments such as carbon<br>
black titanium oxide titanium yellow phthalocyanine<br>
isoindolinone a quinacridone compound a condensed azo compound<br>
ultramarine blue cobalt blue and the like without adversely<br>
affecting the purpose of the present invention.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is described in more detail with<br>
reference to the following examples but the present invention<br>
is not limited by the examples. Here measurement of various<br>
properties and preparation of samples for measurement as<br>
described herein were made by the following methods.<br>
 Preparation of Sample for Measurement<br>
To 100 parts by weight of an ethylene polymer in the<br>
particulate form 0.20 part by weight of<br>
tri(24-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate as a secondary<br>
anti-oxidizing agent 0.20 part by weight of<br>
n-octadecyl-3-(4'-hydroxy-3'5'-di-t-butylphenyl)propionate<br>
as a heat-resistant stabilizer and 0.15 part by weight of calcium<br>
stearate as a hydrochloric acid absorbent were blended.<br>
Thereafter a sample for measurement was prepared by<br>
pelletization at a resin extrusion amount of 25 kg/hr and at a<br>
set temperature of 200°C using a single screw extruder (screw<br>
diameter 65 mm L/D=28 screen mesh #40/#60/#300x4/#60/#40)<br>
manufactured by Placo Co. Ltd.<br>
 Measurement of Ethylene Content and a-olefin Content<br>
The ethylene content and the a-olefin content in the<br>
44<br>
molecular chain of the ethylene polymer were measured by 13C-NMR.<br>
Measurement was made using a Lambda 500-type nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance unit (1H: 500 MHz) manufactured by JEOL Ltd with an<br>
integral number of 10000 to 30000. A commercially available<br>
quartz glass tube for NMR measurement with a diameter of 10 mm<br>
was charged with 250 to 400 mg of the sample and 2 ml of ultra<br>
pure grade hexachlorobutadiene (Wako Pure Chemical Industries<br>
Ltd.)  and the mixture was heated at 120°C and uniformly dispersed<br>
to a solution which was subjected to NMR measurement. The<br>
assignment of each absorption in the NMR spectrum was based on<br>
"NMR - General Remarks and Guidelines to Experimentation [I]"<br>
Kagaku no Ryoiki extra edition No. 141 pp. 132-133.<br>
Measurement of the sample was made under the measurement<br>
conditions such as a measurement temperature of 120°C a<br>
measurement frequency of 125.7 MHz a spectrum width of 250000<br>
Hz a pulse repetition time of 4.5 seconds and 45° pulse.<br>
 Cross Fractionation Chromatography (CFC)<br>
The following measurement was made using a CFC T-150A type<br>
manufactured by Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. Ltd. The<br>
separation column consisted of three Shodex AT-806 MS the eluent<br>
was o-dichlorobenzene the sample concentration was 0.1 to 0.3<br>
wt/vol % the injected amount was 0.5 ml and the flow rate was<br>
1.0 ml/min. The sample was heated at 145°C for 2 hours<br>
subsequently cooled to 0°C at a rate of 10°C/hr and further<br>
maintained at 0°C for 60 min to be coated with the sample. The<br>
capacity of the temperature rising elution column was 0.86 ml<br>
and the line capacity was 0.06 ml. As for the detector an<br>
infrared spectrometer MIRAN 1A CVF type (CaF2 cell) manufactured<br>
by FOXBORO Inc. set in the absorbance mode with a response time<br>
of 10 seconds was used to detect an infrared ray of 3.42 pm (2924<br>
cm"1) . The elution temperature was such that the range of 0°C<br>
to 145°C was divided into 35 to 55 fractions and particularly<br>
in the vicinity of an elution peak the temperature was divided<br>
into fractions corresponding to 1°C each. The indication of the<br>
temperature is all in integers and for example an elution<br>
fraction at 90°C indicates a component eluted at 89°C to 90°C.<br>
The molecular weights of the components not coated even at 0°C<br>
and the fraction eluted at each temperature were measured which<br>
were converted to the molecular weights in terms of PE using a<br>
standard calibration curve. The SEC temperature was 145°C the<br>
amount of injected of the internal standard was 0.5 ml the<br>
position of injection was at 3.0 ml and the data sampling time<br>
interval was 0.50 second. Here when pressure abnormality<br>
occurred due to the presence of too many eluted components within<br>
a narrow temperature range the sample concentration would be<br>
set to less than 0.1 wt/vol %. Data processing was carried out<br>
by means of an analysis program attached to the apparatus "CFC<br>
Data Processing (version 1.50)." Although cross fractionation<br>
chromatography (CFC) per se is said to be an analytic method of<br>
reproducing the results with high analytic precision as far as<br>
the conditions for measurement are strictly maintained constant<br>
the measurements were performed in several times to take the<br>
average in Examples of the present invention.<br>
 Weight Average Molecular Weight (Mw) Number Average<br>
Molecular Weight (Mn) and Molecular Weight Curve<br>
Measurement was carried out as follows using a GPC-150C<br>
manufactured by Waters Corp. The separating columns used were<br>
TSKgel GMH6-HT and TSKgel GMH6-HTL the column size was each an<br>
inner diameter of 7.5 mm and a length of 600 mm the column<br>
temperature was 140°C the mobile phase was o-dichlorobenzene<br>
(Wako Pure Chemicals Industry Ltd.) containing 0.025% by weight<br>
of BHT (Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) as the anti-oxidizing<br>
agent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min the sample concentration<br>
was 0.1% by weight the amount of sample injected was 500 jil<br>
and the detector used was a differential refractometer. For the<br>
standard polystyrene a product by Tosoh Corporation was used<br>
for the molecular weight of Mwl000 and Mw4xl06 and a product<br>
by Pressure Chemical Co. for the molecular weight of<br>
1000Mw4xl06. The molecular weight was a value determined in<br>
terms of polyethylene by means of universal calibration.<br>
 Intrinsic Viscosity ( [r|] )<br>
This is a value measured at 135°C using decalin as the<br>
solvent. That is about 20 mg of granulated pellets is dissolved<br>
in 15 ml of decalin and the specific viscosity r|sp is measured<br>
in an oil bath at 135°C. This decalin solution is diluted by<br>
further adding 5 ml of the decalin solvent and then the specific<br>
viscosity r|sp is measured in the same manner. This dilution<br>
procedure is further repeated two times to determine the value<br>
of T|sp/C as the intrinsic viscosity (see the following formula) <br>
with the concentration (C) being extrapolated to zero.<br>
[Ti]=lim(TiSp /C) (C-»0)<br>
 Density (d)<br>
A specimen for measurement was prepared by molding a sheet<br>
having a thickness of 0.5 mm (spacer-shaped; 9 sheets of 45x45x0.5<br>
mm obtained from a sheet of 240x240x0.5 mm) under a pressure of<br>
100 kg/cm2 using a hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured<br>
by Shinto Metal Industries Ltd. set at 190°C and cooling the<br>
obtained sheet via compressing it under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2<br>
using another hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured by<br>
Shinto Metal Industries Ltd. set at 20°C. The heating plate<br>
used was an SUS plate with a thickness of 5 mm. This pressed<br>
sheet was subjected to heat treatment at 120°C for one hour and<br>
gradual cooling to room temperature linearly over 1 hour and<br>
then the density was measured using a density gradient column.<br>
 Measurement of Melt flow rate (MFR)<br>
The MFR was measured according to the method of ASTM D1238-89 at 190°C under a load of 5 kg and 21.6 kg.<br>
* Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance Test for Pressed Sheet: ESCR (hr)<br>
A specimen for measurement was prepared by molding a sheet having a thickness of 2 mm (spacer-shaped; 4 sheets of 80x80x2 mm from a sheet of 240x240x2 mm) under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using a hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, Ltd. set at 190°C, and cooling the obtained sheet via compressing it under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using another hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries, ltd. set at 20°C. The heating plate used was an SUS plate with a thickness of 5 mm. From the above pressed sheet of 80x80x2 mm, a dumbbell-shaped specimen with a size of 13 mmx38 mm was punched out to provide a sample for evaluation. The test for the property of environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR) was performed according to ASTM D1693. The conditions for evaluation (bent strip method) are summarized in the following:<br>
Shape of sample: Press molding method C<br>

Holding of sample: The sample is set using a clinching<br>
(Table Removed) device exclusively used for a specimen holder with an inner<br>
dimension of 11.75 mm and a length of 165 mm.<br>
Surfactant: Nonylphenyl polyoxyethylene ethanol<br>
(commercially available under the product name of Antarox CO-630)<br>
is diluted with water to a concentration of 10% for use.<br>
Method of evaluation: time to fracture F50 (time to 50%<br>
fracture) is determined using logarithmic probability paper.<br>
 Test on Flexural Modulus of Pressed Sheet<br>
This was measured by the method in accordance with the<br>
section "Flexural Modulus" of "General Properties and Test<br>
conditions therefor" in JIS K6922-2 (Table 3)  and the test method<br>
of Flexural Modulus as described in JIS K7171. Specifically<br>
from a pressed sheet having a thickness 4 mm obtained at a<br>
temperature of 40°C under the conditions of a molding temperature<br>
of 180°C and an average cooling rate of 15°C/min a specimen<br>
with a length 80 mm a width 10 mm and a thickness 4 mm was punched<br>
out and the flexural modulus was measured under the conditions<br>
of a testing temperature of 23°C a bending span distance of 64<br>
mm and a test rate of 2.0 mm/min.<br>
 tan8 (=loss modulus G'/storage modulus G')<br>
Detailed information on tan8 is described in for example<br>
"Lecture on Rheology" by Japan Society of Rheology Kobunshi<br>
Kankokai pp. 20-23. The measurement was carried out by<br>
measuring the angular frequency (co (rad/sec) ) dispersion of the<br>
50<br>
storage modulus G' (Pa) and the loss modulus G'1 (Pa) using a<br>
rheometer RDS-II manufactured by Rheometrics Inc. The sample<br>
holder used was a pair of parallel plates with 25 mmf and the<br>
sample thickness was about 2 mm. Under the measuring temperature<br>
of 190°C G' and G' ' were measured within the range of 0. 04to400.<br>
The measurement was obtained at five points per one digit of oo.<br>
The amount of strain was suitably selected within the range of<br>
2 to 25% under the conditions that the torque is detectable within<br>
the range for measurement and no torque-over occurs.<br>
 Preparation of Bottle for the Measurement of Buckling<br>
Strength and Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance (ESCR)<br>
Property and the Observation of Pinch-Off Property of Bottle<br>
Using an extrusion blow molding machine (model: 3B<br>
50-40-40) manufactured by Placo Co. Ltd. blow molding was<br>
carried out under the following conditions: set temperature:<br>
180°C die diameter: 23 mm| core diameter: 21 mm| amount<br>
extruded: 12 kg/hr mold temperature: 25°C rate of clamping:<br>
1.4 sec clamping pressure: 5.5t and blow air pressure: 5 kg/cm2.<br>
Thus a cylindrical bottle having a capacity of 1000 cc and a<br>
net weight of 50 g was obtained.<br>
 Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance (ESCR) Property<br>
of Bottle<br>
The bottle prepared as above was charged with 100 cc of<br>
Kitchen Hiter manufactured by Kao Corp. and then was sealed at<br>
51<br>
the opening with resin. The bottle and the contents were<br>
maintained in an oven at 65°C to observe the time to fracture.<br>
Thus the time to fracture F50 was determined using logarithmic<br>
probability paper.<br>
 Pinch-Off Property of Bottle (Measurement of the<br>
Thickness Ratio of Pinched Part)<br>
When the bottom of the bottle obtained by blow molding as<br>
described above was cut in the direction perpendicular to the<br>
matching surface of the mold the thickness ratio of the pinched<br>
part is represented by (a/b)  wherein a represents the thickness<br>
at the central part of the bottle and b represents the thickness<br>
at the thickest part. As this value is larger the state of<br>
pinching is good (see Fig. 5).<br>
 Buckling Strength of Bottle<br>
The bottle obtained by blow molding as described above was<br>
allowed to stand vertically and a load was applied vertically<br>
from the top to the bottom of the bottle at 23°C and a test speed<br>
of 20 mm/min. Upon compression the generated maximum load was<br>
reported as a buckling strength of the bottle.<br>
 Apparent Shear Stress<br>
The apparent shear stress was measured using a Capillary<br>
Rheometer manufactured by Toyo Seiki Co. Ltd. with a capillary<br>
die having an inner diameter of 0.5 mm and a length of 3.0 mm<br>
at 190°C and a shear rate of 194.57 sec"1 in accordance with<br>
52<br>
JIS K7199. The barrel diameter of the Capillary Rheometer was<br>
9.55 mm.<br>
 Tensile Fatigue Strength at 80°C<br>
A specimen for the measurement of tensile fatigue strength<br>
at 80°C was prepared by molding a 6 mm-thick sheet (spacer-shaped:<br>
4 specimens of a size of 30x60x6 mm obtained from a sheet of a<br>
size of 200x200x6 mm) at a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using a hydraulic<br>
thermal press machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries<br>
Ltd. set at 190°C and by cooling the sheets via compressing under<br>
a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using another hydraulic thermal press<br>
machine manufactured by Shinto Metal Industries Ltd. set at 20°C.<br>
From the pressed sheet having a size of 30x60x6 mm a rectangular<br>
column with a size of length 5 to 6 mmxwidth 6 mmxheight 60 mm<br>
was cut out for use as a specimen for the evaluation of actual<br>
measurement.<br>
The tensile fatigue strength (specimen form) was measured<br>
according to JIS K-6774 using a Servo-Pulser of the<br>
EHF-ERlKNx4-40L type manufactured by Shimazu Seisakusho Ltd.<br>
(Full-notch type notch depth=l mm) . Summary of the evaluation<br>
conditions are as follows: several points were measured under<br>
the conditions of specimen form: 5 to 6x6x60 mm notched<br>
rectangular column; waveform and frequency for testing:<br>
rectangular wave 0.5 Hz; temperature for testing: 80°C; and<br>
actual stress in the range of 10 to 18 MPa. The oscillation<br>
53<br>
frequency upon fracture of the specimen was taken as the fatigue<br>
strength. Here at least three points of different actual stress<br>
values were measured for a three or more digit number of cycles<br>
to fracture or under an actual stress in the range of 3 MPa or<br>
greater in order to provide an approximation formula by means<br>
of the least square method with logarithmic approximation. Thus<br>
the actual stress values with the numbers of cycles to fracture<br>
corresponding to 10000 cycles and 100000 cycles were<br>
determined.<br>
 Tensile Fatigue Strength at 23°C<br>
A 3 mm-thick dumbbell (ASTM-D-1822 Type S) as shown in Fig.<br>
4 was prepared by molding (spacer-shaped: the form of ASTM-D-1822<br>
Type S was provided from the sheet having a size of 240x240x3<br>
mm) under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2 using a hydraulic thermal press<br>
machine manufactured Shinto Metal Industries Ltd. set at 190°C<br>
and cooling it via compressing under a pressure of 100 kg/cm2<br>
using another hydraulic thermal press machine manufactured by<br>
Shinto Metal Industries Ltd. set at 20°C a sample for evaluation<br>
of the tensile fatigue strength at 23°C was taken therefrom. An<br>
SUS plate with a thickness of 5 mm was used as a heating plate.<br>
The tensile fatigue strength at 23°C was measured according to<br>
JIS K-7118 using a Servo-Pulser of the EHF-FG10KN-4 LA type<br>
manufactured by Shimazu Seisakusho Ltd. Summary of the<br>
evaluation conditions are presented below.<br>
54<br>
Specimen shape: ASTM-D-1822 Type S (Dumbbell as described<br>
in Fig. 3 unnotched)<br>
Waveform and frequency for testing: sinusoidal wave 4 Hz<br>
Temperature for testing: 23°C<br>
The tensile fatigue strength test was carried out by<br>
measuring at several points under the above-mentioned conditions<br>
(testing temperature waveform and frequency for testing) with<br>
a constant minimum load of the load cell of 4.9 N (0.5 kgf) and<br>
an actual stress with the maximum corrected at the central<br>
cross-section of the specimen prior to testing in the range of<br>
14 to 27 MPa. A 50% elongation of the specimen was defined as<br>
fracture and the oscillation frequency at this time was taken<br>
as the fatigue strength for the actual stress loaded. The actual<br>
stress corresponding to 10000 cycles and 100000 cycles to<br>
fracture was determined by performing measurement for at least<br>
one digit number of cycles to fracture or to obtain an actual<br>
stress in the range of 1 MPa or greater and providing an<br>
approximation formula by means of the least square method with<br>
logarithmic approximation.<br>
[Synthesis Example 1]<br>
[Preparation of Solid Catalyst Component (a)]<br>
A suspension was prepared from 8.5 kg of silica dried at<br>
200°C for 3 hours and 33 liters of toluene and then 82.7 liters<br>
of a methylaluminoxane solution (Al=1.42 mol/liter) was added<br>

dropwise over 30 minutes. Then the temperature of the mixture<br>
was elevated to 115°C over 1.5 hours and the mixture was allowed<br>
to react at that temperature for 4 hours. Subsequently the<br>
reaction mixture was cooled to 60°C and the supernatant liquid<br>
was removed by decantation. Thus obtained solid catalyst<br>
component was washed with toluene three times and resuspended<br>
in toluene to yield a solid catalyst component (a) (total volume<br>
150 liters).<br>
[Synthesis Example 2]<br>
[Preparation of Supported Catalyst]<br>
In a reactor which had been sufficiently purged with<br>
nitrogen 19.60 mmol (in terms of aluminum) of the solid catalyst<br>
component (a) suspended in toluene synthesized in Synthesis<br>
Example 1 was added and under stirring 2 liters (61.12 mmol)<br>
of a 31.06 mmol/liter solution of<br>
di(p-tolyl)methylene(cyclopentadienyl)<br>
(octamethyloctahydrodibenzof luorenyl) zirconium dichloride was<br>
added to the suspension at room temperature (20 to 25°C) and<br>
the resulting mixture being stirred for 60 minutes. After<br>
stirring being stopped the supernatant liquid was removed by<br>
decantation and the mixture was washed with 40 liters of n-hexane<br>
for two times. Thus obtained supported catalyst was reslurried<br>
in n-hexane to yield a solid catalyst component (y) as 25 liters<br>
of a catalyst suspension.<br>

[Preparation of Solid Catalyst Component (8) by<br>
Prepolymerization of Solid Catalyst Component (y) ]<br>
To a reactor equipped with a stirrer 15.8 liters of<br>
purified n-hexane and the above-mentioned solid catalyst<br>
component (y) were introduced under a nitrogen atmosphere then<br>
5 mol of triisobutylaluminum was added under stirring and<br>
prepolymerization was carried out with ethylene in an amount such<br>
that 3 g of polyethylene is produced per gram of the solid<br>
component in 4 hours. The polymerization temperature was<br>
maintained at 20 to 25°C. After completion of polymerization<br>
stirring was stopped the supernatant liquid was removed by<br>
decantation and the solids were washed with 35 liters of n-hexane<br>
for 4 times. Thus obtained supported catalyst was suspended in<br>
20 liters of n-hexane to give a solid catalyst component (6) as<br>
a catalyst suspension.<br>

and at 60°C.<br>
Then the s were continuously supplied to a second<br>
polymerization reactor together with 43 liters/hr of hexane<br>
5.5 kg/hr of ethylene 5.0 N-liter/hr of hydrogen and 270 g/hr<br>
of 1-hexene and polymerization was continued under the<br>
conditions such as a polymerization temperature of 75°C a<br>
reaction pressure of 2.3 kg/cm2G and an average residence time<br>
of 1.4 hr.<br>
Also for the second polymerization reactor the contents<br>
75<br>
of the polymerization reactor were continuously withdrawn so that<br>
the liquid level in the polymerization reactor would be<br>
maintained constant. In order to prevent undesirable<br>
polymerization such as generation of a polymer containing a large<br>
proportion of 1-hexene methanol was supplied to the contents<br>
withdrawn from the second polymerization reactor at a rate of<br>
2 liters/hr to deactivate the catalyst for polymerization. Then<br>
the contents were subjected to removal of hexane and unreacted<br>
monomer in a solvent separation unit and dried to give the polymer.<br>
Next with respect to 100 parts by weight of the polymer<br>
particle 0.1 part by weight of<br>
tri(24-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate as a secondary<br>
anti-oxidizing agent 0.10 part by weight of<br>
n-octadecyl-3-(4'-hydroxy-3' 5'-di-t-butylphenyl)propionate<br>
as a heat-resistant stabilizer and 0.10 part by weight of calcium<br>
stearate as a hydrochloric acid absorbent were blended.<br>
Thereafter a sample for measurement was prepared by<br>
pelletization at a set temperature of 200°C and a resin extrusion<br>
amount of 25 kg/hr and using a single screw extruder (screw<br>
diameter 65 mm L/D=28 screen mesh 40/60/300x4/60/40)<br>
manufactured by Placo Co. Ltd. Further a pressed sheet was<br>
prepared using this sample to measure the properties. The<br>
results are presented in Tables le to 5e. As compared with<br>
Comparative Examples 2e and 3e this sample has extremely higher<br>
76<br>
tensile fatigue strength at 80°C than that of the samples used<br>
in Comparative Examples 2e and 3e. Further as it can be seen<br>
from the results that the apparent shear stress is almost the<br>
same as that of the samples used in Comparative Examples 2e and<br>
3e this sample has comparative moldability. Further this<br>
sample has tensile fatigue strength at 80°C of no less than that<br>
of the sample used in Comparative Example le and apparent shear<br>
stress is extremely lower than the sample used in Comparative<br>
Example le showing good moldability. That is it can be seen that<br>
as compared with Comparative Examples this sample is excellent<br>
in the balance between tensile fatigue strength and moldability.<br>
