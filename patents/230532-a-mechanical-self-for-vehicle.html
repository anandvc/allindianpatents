				<td>This invention relates to a mechanical self  vehicles<br>
The use of the self in the vehicle is well known in the art to start the vehicle. These selfs are the electric motor for which the batteries are required to provide the power supply. However it is seen that the self used with the tractor usually do not work after some time.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide a mechanical self for use with the vehicles and with the electric generators.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a self wherein the electric power/battery is not required.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a mechanical self for<br><br>
vehicles comprising a plurality of strip coils mounted on a main shaft being disposed in a main casing rotatably, a free-wheel disposed in said casing mounted on main shaft to allow the shaft to rotate in one direction, a gear adapted to be rotated by a gear train mounted on said main shaft to rotate said shaft for contracting strip coils over main shaft,<br>
a starting gear being provided on a ratchet gear mounted rotatably on main shaft towards the outer end of main shaft being extended outwardly of the casing, a starting ratchet mounted at the outer end of main shaft slidably being provided to engage starting gear with said shaft to provide rotational movement to starting gear upon unlocking free wheel by means of a start lever; a hand lever being provided with casing to engage starting gear with ratchet gear mounted on shaft and for rotating the main shaft.<br>
In accordance with this invention a plurality of strip coils are secured<br>
with a main shaft disposed in a casing. Bearing are provided at either<br>
end of the casing for supporting the main shaft rotatably therein. A<br>
frewheel is mounted on said shaft towards the end of the casing from<br>
where the main shaft is extending outwardly. A driving gear is mounted<br>
on the shaft and disposed with the casing, such that to receive the drive<br>
from a second gear through a<br>
reverse gear provided therebetween. The second qear is mounted on a screw conveyer shaft disposed i n a s e c o n d casing s e c u r e d w i t h the m a i n casing. A third gear is mounted ait the outer end of the screw conveyer shaft which is extended outwardly from the second cashing and such that to receive the drive from the fourth gear mounted on a gear ratchet fitted slidably over the main shaft.<br>
The gear ratchet is adapted to tae engaged with B second ratchet having a starting gear p r o v i d ed t her eon a nd rota ta b1y mou nt e d o n said shaft towards the outer end such that to receive the drive from the crank shaft of the vehic1e by mearis of gear assembly and visa-versa,, A driving ratchet is slidably fitted over the end of main shaft such that to be; engaged with the ratchet of the starting gear so as to rotate the starting gear and thus the c r a n k shiaft of t h e v e h i c 1 e in order to start the vehicle upon unlocking the free wheel by means of a start lever as and when required by utilising the expending force of the strip coils-wounded on the main shaft. A screw conveyer nut is provided on the screw conveyer so as to move in the left and right direction.<br>
A hand lever is secured with the main casing so as to engage and disengage the first ratchet with the ratchet of the starting gear.<br>
A mechanical self for use with the vehicles according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:--<br>
Fig.l    Shows the sectional view  of  the<br>
m e c h a n i c a 1  s e 1 f f<br>
Fig.2      Shows the side view of the strip coil .<br>
Referring t o the drawings particu1ar1y fig.l, the mechanical self of this invention has a p 3. u r a 1 i t y o f strip c o i 1 s 1 (see fig. 2 ') t h e inner ends of which are secured with a main shaft 2 disposed in a main casing 3. The outer end of the coils 1 are secured to the main casing /body 3, Bearings 4 and 5 are provided at either end of cashing 3 for supporting the main shaft 2 r o t a t a b 1 y â€ž A f r e e w h e e 1 6 i s m o u n t e d o n t h e shaft i near the coil strips 1 and on one side such that to allow the shaft 2. to rotate only<br>
in  one direction,,  A start lever  7  is  provided<br>
to  lock   the movement  of  the free-wheel  6.   A<br>
first  gear 8  mounted on the shaft 1  is  disposed<br>
within the casing 3 such that to  receive the drive<br>
from  a second gear 9 through  a reverse   gear  10<br>
provided with the casing 3.   The second gear 9  is<br>
mounted on a screw  conveyer  shaft 11 disposed  in<br>
a second casing  12; secured  with the main casing 3<br>
at one  side thereof.  A third gear  13 is  mounted<br>
at  the end  extending  outwardly from the   casing<br>
12  such t hat to r e c e i ve the dr i v e  fr om a  dr i ving<br>
gear  14  mounted on  a rachet  gear 15  which   is<br>
slidably   mounted on the main  shaft  2.   Ratchet<br>
gear 15 is  adapted  to  be engaged  and disengaged<br>
with   a second  ratchet  gear 16  mounted on  main<br>
shaft  2 through  the valve bearing.   A   starting<br>
gear  17  is provided  over the second ratchet   16<br>
such that  to receive the drive  from the  crank of<br>
vehicle  through  a  connecting   gear  chain  (not<br>
s h o w n ).   A  s t a r t i n g   r a t c h e t  18  i s    s 1 i d a b 1 y<br>
mounted  on  the outer  end of  the main   shaft  2<br>
such  that to  be engaged with the second   ratchet<br>
16 so as to provide rotational movement to the starting gear 17 mounted on the ratchet 16 in order to start the vehicle. A hand lever 19 is secured with the main casing 1 such that to slide the ratchet 15 so as to engage it with the ratchet 16 for driving the gears 13,9 10 and 8 so as to rotate the main shaft 2 for contracting the strip coils 1 over the main shaft 2. A screw c o n v e y e r n u t 2 0 i s p r o v i d e d o v e r t h e s c r e w conveyer 11 such that to disengage the ratchet 15 from the ratchet 16 when the strip coils 1 are f u 11 y c o n t r a c t e d .<br>
D u r i n g ope ra t i o n o f t he se1f a nd when the user wants to start the vehicle the starting ratchet 18 is engaged with the ratchet 16 and then the free wheel 6 is unlocked with the help of the start lever 7. The starting gear 17 rotates and as i t i s e n g a ge d wit h the c r a n k of the vehi c1e through the gear chain. it rotates the crank of the vehicle and thus start the vehicle. When the v e hide is s t art e d t h e rat c h e t 18 a u t o m a t i c ally shift away and disengaged from the ratchet 16. Now  the ratchet 15 i s shifted towards the<br>
ratchet 1B to engage therewith by using the hand lever 19 and which starts rotating the gear 13 and inconsequence the gears 3, 10 and 8 starts rotating. As the gear S is securedly mounted over the main shaft 2, the shaft 2 starts rotating and starts c o n t r a c t :i. n g t h e s t r i p c o i 1 o v e r t h e ma in shaft 2 so as to p r overstraining tensiona1 force therein. Simultaneously, the screw conveyor nut 20 start moving towards the hand lever -19 and disengaged the ratchet 15 from the ratchet IB at the same time when the contraction of coil strips 1 are completed. Thus the self is ready for t he n e x t s t a r t i n g o p e r a t i o n . .<br><br><br>
