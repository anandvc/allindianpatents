Process for printing substrates according to the ink-iet printing method<br>
The present invention relates to a process for printing substrates, for example paper, plastics films or textile fibre materials; according to the ink-jet printing method, and to the ink compositions used in accordance with that process.<br>
US-B-6,433,117 relaxes to aqueous ink jet inks containing a copolymer dispersant comprising at least one polymerized monomer having the general formula<br>
CH2=C(R3)C(0)OXa(C2H40)b-(C3H60)c-R4, where a=0 or 1; wnen a=1 r X is an akyL aryl, or alkaryl diradicai connecting group of 1-9 carbon atoms; b and c are independently selected from the range of 0-100 provided that b and c are not simultaneously 0; P3 is H or CH3; and R4 is preferably P03H2.<br>
DE-A-1S727757 relates :o radiation curable ink jet inks containing at least one fine-grained organic or inorganic pigment. Interference pigments are mentioned as examples of inorganic pigments. Preferably 9c %; especially preferred 99 % of the pigments have a particle size 
Althougn organic pigments are superior to dyes in terms of fastness to light, problems arise with resoec. tc dispe^c: in water-based ink compositions and with respect to the removal of<br>
ncn-disoersbie acoiorr;erates therefrom.<br>
i: has now; surprising1}', oeen found that metallic or non-metallic, inorganic plateiet-shaped particles having an eve-age panicle diameter of from &gt; 2 to 20 urn, especially from 3 to 15 μM can readii; oe dispersec in water-based ink compositions and the particles, if they have settiec: can readiiy s= redispersec, for example by shaking.<br>
The'present invention accordingly relates to an aqueous ink composition that comprises<br>
k) metallic or non-meia^c, inorganic platelet-shaped panicles having an average particle<br>
diameter of a: least 2 urn.<br>
5) a dispersan: and 2} a binde\ and also<br>
tc- a process fo- pnntin: substrates according to the ink-jet printing method that comprises<br>
printing the substrates with the above-mentioned aqueous ink composition.<br>
Metallic or non-metallic, inorganic platelet-shaped particles or pigments are effect pigments, (especially metal effect pigments or interference pigments), that is to say, pigments that,<br><br>
besides imparting colour to an application medium, impart additional properties, for example angle dependency of the colour (flop), lustre (not surface gloss) or texture. On metal effect pigments, substantially oriented reflection occurs at directionally oriented pigment particles. In the case of interference pigments, the colour-imparting effect is due to the phenomenon of interference of light in thin, highly refractive layers.<br>
~ne average particle diameter is determined by electron microscopy. The average particle diameter or the size graae of the platelet-shaped particles can be adjusted in accordance with the invention also by means of (test) sieving machines, for example the vibratory sieving machine "Analysette 2'. mode! PRO (Fritsch), using micro-precision sieves of 100 0 according to ISO 3310-3 with aperture sizes of 5 μm, 10 μm, 15 \μm and 20 μm. For that purpose, two sieves are positioned one above the other in the test sieving machine in such a manner that the mesh size decreases in the downward direction. This means that the material passing through the upper sieve falls onto the next sieve in the arrangement. As a result, a certain numbe- of particles are retained on the individual sieves. The size grade of those particles is characterised by the mesh size of the upper sieve (10 μm, 15μm or 20 μm, preferably 15 urn or 20 urn) and of the receiving sieve (5 μm, 10 μm or 15μrn, preferably 5 urn or 10 μm).<br>
A preferred ernbodine" of the present invention employs aqueous ink compositions in wnich meta! fiakes: especially silver flakes and aluminium flakes, are used as the platelet-shaped particles. Sue metal flakes, especially silver flakes, can be used to produce<br>
conductive inks.<br>
The term "SiOr with C.?5 ≤   : ≤   2.0,: means that the molar ratio of oxygen to silicon at the average value c* the s'^con cxioe layer is from 0.95 to 2.0. The composition of the silicon oxide layer can be determined by ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis).<br>
Tne term "SiCx with C.C2  ≤  x ≤   0.95" means that the molar ratio of oxygen to silicon at the average value of the silicon oxide layer is from 0.03 to 0.95. The composition of the silicon oxide layer can be determined by ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis).<br>
According to the present invention the term "aluminum" comprises aluminum and alloys of aluminum. Alloys of aluminum are, for example, described in G. Wassermann in Ullmanns Enzyklopadie der Industrielien Chemie, 4. Auflage, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Band 7, S. 281 to 292. Especially suitable are the corrosion stable aluminum alloys described on page<br><br>
10 to 12 of W000/12634, which comprise besides of aluminum silicon, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, nickel vanadium, lead, antimony, tin, cadmium, bismuth, titanium, chromium and/or iron in amounts of less than 20 % by weight, preferably less than 10 % by weioht.<br>
The aluminium flakes are preferably obtained by means of a process (see, for example, WO00/1897B, WOC2/023512, WO33/90613, US-B-6,270,840, US-A-4,321,087; comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	vapour-deposition of a separating agent onto a (movable) carrier to produce a separating-agent layer,<br>
b)	vapour-deposition of an aluminium layer onto the separating-agent layer,<br>
c)	dissolution of the separating-agent layer in a solvent, and<br>
d)	separation of the aluminium flakes from the solvent.<br>
Tne process mentioned above makes available aluminium flakes that have a high degree of piane parallelism and a defined thickness in the region of ± 10 %, preferably ± 5 %, of the<br>
averaae thickness.<br>
The aluminium flakes nave an average diameter of at least 2 μ n, especially from &gt; 2 to 20 μ m. more especially from 3 to 15 μ rn, and most preferred from 5 to 15 jxm. The thickness of the aluminium flakes is general!}- from 10 to 150 nm, especially from 10 to 100 nm, and more especially from 30 TO 52 μ m.<br>
lr; order to be able to use tne aluminium pigments in aqueous ink-jet compositions, it is necessary to" tnose pigments tc be protected against corrosion by water. According to R. 5esoio; AJjmhi'jmoigmenie fCr wassrige Beschichtungen - Widerspruch oder Wirkiichkeit?. "arbe - Lack ?7 (1991) 311 -314, a large number of procedures, which can be divided into two groups, are known for the stabilisation of aluminium pigments:<br>

In order to produce the auminium pigment from the (multi-layered) film, first of all the separating-ageni layer is dissolved using a solvent, the film is peeled off the substrate, and the fragments of film produced as a result are comminuted, if appropriate after washing and filtering. Comminution of the fragments of film to pigment size is effected by means of ultrasound or by mechanical means using high-speed stirrers in a liquid medium, or after drying the fragments in an air-jet mill having a rotary classifier. Depending on whether the pigment comminution is earned out in a liquid medium or in the dry state, the free metal surfaces of the aluminium pigment, which is obtained in a particle size of from 5 to 60 \irr\, preferably from ',2TO 35 μ n, are covered with a passivating protective layer either during the comminution p'ocecu-e or following that procedure, by means of one of the above-mentionec processes   see E::-A-82S745).<br>
A further- prefe^ec emoodiment of tne present invention employs aqueous ink compositions in which the 2ia:eiet-snaoec particles used are SiOz-( especially SiCfe-coated aluminium flakes.<br>

The further layers can be apolied z the pa-a:;e: faces or to the entire surface. The thickness of tne aluminium layer is generally from 10 nm to 150 nm, especially from 10 nm to 100 nm, and more especially from 30 to SO nm. The thickness of the SiOz layer is generally from 10 nm to 175 nm, especially from 15 nm to 100 nm, and more especially from 15 to 80 nm.<br><br>
in a particularly preferred embodiment the present invention relates to platelet-shaped aluminum particles comprising:<br>
an aluminum layer having a top surface, a bottom surface, and at least one side surface, and having a thickness o4 30 nm to 60 nm, especially 30 to 50 nm; and a SiOr layer with 0.S5  2 to 20 μ m, more especially from 3 to 15 \im, and most preferred from 5 ic 15μ m.<br>
The aluminum flakes o" the present invention are not of a uniform shape. Nevertheless, for purposes of brevity, the fiakes will be referred to as having a "diameter." The aluminum flakes have a high piane-paraiielism and a defined thickness in the range of ± 30 %, especially ± i0 % o: the average thickness. The aluminum flakes have a thickness of from 60 tc 220 nm, especia'K' from 50 to 100 nm. It is presently preferred that the diameter of the fiakes be ir a preferrec ~ange of &gt; 2 to 20 μ m with a more preferred range of about 3-15 urn. Thus, the aspect rati: of the fiakes of the present invention is in a preferred range of about 9 to 335 with a mo-e preferred range of about 30 to 300.<br>

in tne case of tne "nk-jet printing method, individual droplets of ink are sprayed onto a sjostrate from: a nozzle in a controlled manner. It is mainly the continuous ink-jet method and tne drop-on-demand method that are used for that purpose, in the case of the continuous ink-jet metnoo, tne cropiets are produced continuously, droplets not required for the printing operation being discharged into a receptacle and recycled. In the case of the drop-on-demand method, on the other hand, droplets are generated as desired and used for pointing; that is to say, droplets are generated only when required for the printing operation.<br><br>
Tne production of the aroplets can be effected, for example, by means of a piezc ink-jet head or by thermal energy (ouhhie jet). For the process according to the invention, printing by means of a piezo ink-jet head is preferred, but preference is given also to printing accordinc to the continue JS hk-ist method.<br>
Subsequent curing of the binder, that is fixing the print, can be carried out in customary manner by the appibatic* of neat or high-energy radiation. For that purpose the print is irradiated either under a' inert gas atmosphere (e.g. nitrogen) with electrons (eiectron beam curing) or with high-energy electromagnetic radiation, preferably in a wavelength range of from 220 to 45C nm. The light intensities selected should be adapted to the curing rate in order 10 avoid degradation of the colorant. With a lamp output of from 120 to 240 W/cm. the curing ra:e may be, for example, up to 100 m/min, depending on the concentration and the na:ure of the photoinitiator.<br>
Tne ink compositions according to the invention are distinguished, as ink-jet inks, by advantageous aoplicaticr. properties overall, especially good flow behaviour, and yield pr.nts having a high deg'ee of fastness to light and to water,<br>
Tre hk-jet-hks o* tne present invention comprising effect pigments, are also useful for providing visble. non-cccyabie markings on documents to denote that they are original documents. "Non-copyacie1' shali mean that upon conventional copying techniques such as photocopying, scanning and reprinting, color-copying, and the like, a given property cannot be copied anc impart tne same property in substantially the same way. For example, if a ma-<ing or image has a rrooe that reflects multi-colored light directionally oeoenden: iignt reflective croperty: upon coior-copying the copied marking wil not imcar: tne same orcoem. . even i imaae is scanned and printed usinc printer pen ink pattern o reflected within copy will inevitably be different as exact of calculates duplicated. accordingly present h entbn aisc directe: t: method for document an original comprising: providing image-containing to marked ink-jetting aqueous ink-let according invention onto document.></ing>
"T- e following Examples se~ve to illustrate the invention. Unless stated otherwise, temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, parts are parts by weight and percentages are percentages by weight. The relationship between parts by weight and parts by volume is the same as that between kiiograms and litres.<br><br>
Examples Example 1<br>
A iaye^ of app-cximateiy 5C nm of NaCI is vapour-deposited onto a metallic carrier in a vacuum chamber at a pressure of less than approximately 10~2 Pa at about 900°C. Then, at the same pressure, the following materials are successively vapour-deposited: SiO (as reaction product of Si and S:0L a; from 1350 to 1550°C), Al (at 1400 to 1500°C) and SiO, whereby a film having the layer structure SiO/AI/SiO is produced on the metal belt. The separating agent is then dissolved in water, whereupon flakes come away from the substrate. At atmospheric p-essure, the resulting suspension is concentrated by filtration and rinsed several times with oe:on;sed water in order to remove Na+ and CI" ions that are present. That is followed b\ the steps of drying and heating of the plane-parallel SiO/AI/SiO structures in the form of loose material at 500°C for two hours in an oven through which air heatec to 530°C is passed. Or. neating of the platelets, the SiO layer is converted into an SiGs ;ayer. After cooiho; comminution and grading by air-sieving are carried out. Tne resulting Si02(40 nm, Al " DC nm)/SiO2(40 nm) flakes are then ground to form particles havnc an average oianete* o"'" C urn, which is measured by means of electron microscopy.<br>
Tne above-mentioned 3;C, -C nm)/AI(100 nm)/SiO2(40 nm) flakes are used to prepare an ir.k composition c*" tne •emulation indicated below:<br><br>
Tne ink can then be dispensed simply by shaking, since the 5i02/AI/Si02 flakes are readily disoe-siDle in water-basec systems.<br>
Application Example 1<br>
The ink composition oDtahec in Example 1 is printed on a commercially available ink-jet paper using a drop-on-demand ink-jet printer. The prints have a metallic appearance.<br><br>
By proceeding as indicated in Example 1 but using, instead of the SiO2(40 nm)/AI(100 nm)/SiO2(40 nm) flakes, the flakes listed in the Table below, there are likewise obtained prints having a metallic appearance, colour flop, a high colour brilliance and/or a high tinctorial strength.<br><br><br>
