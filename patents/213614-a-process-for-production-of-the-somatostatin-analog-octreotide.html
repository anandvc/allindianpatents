Octreotide by solution peptide chemistry and use of inexpensive amino acid<br>
derivative.		<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.	<br>
                         31 MAY 2005 <br><br><br><br><br>
A PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG, OCTREOTIDE<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the commercial production of the somatostatin analog, octreotide (I) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, using solution peptide chemistry, in high yield and purity.<br><br>
I<br>
The present invention also relates to the intermediate compounds useful in the synthesis of octreotide.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Octreotide is a highly potent and pharmacologically selective analog of somatostatin. It inhibits growth hormone for long duration and is therefore indicated for acromegaly to control and reduce the plasma level of growth hormone. The presence of D-Phe at the N-terminal and an amino alcohol at the C -terminal, along with D-tryptophan and a cyclic structure makes it very resistant to metabolic degradation.<br>
The only solution synthesis reported in literature is by Bauer,W. and Pless, J. in Pat. No. U.S. 4,395,403 and EP029579.<br>
Several solid phase syntheses have been subsequently described viz. Patent Nos. EP0953577A1 and U.S. 5,889,146 and in various research publications. Mergler et   al   (Proceedings   of the   12th  American  Peptide   Symposium)   have   used<br><br><br><br><br>
2<br><br><br><br>
aminomethyl resin and Fmoc-butyl protection scheme for synthesis of octreotide. Alsina et al. Tetrahedron Letters, 38, 883, 1997) have used an active carbonate resin and Boc-Bzl protection scheme, necessitating the use of hydrogen fluoride/anisole for final deprotection. Edwards et al (J. Med. Chem., 37, 3749, 1994)) have described another synthesis using Fmoc-butyl protection and HMP resin, and Berta et al (EP 0 953 577A1) a synthesis using 2-chlorotrityl- type resin and Fmoc-butyl protection scheme.<br>
All the solid phase syntheses described are useful only for the manufacture of small quantities of octreotide (100-300 mg). These procedures are not suitable for commercial manufacture of octreotide because they use costly resins and costly Fmoc-butyl protected amino acids in 2 to 4 times excess at every step. In one synthesis the final deprotection is carried out with hydrogen fluoride, a destructive and hazardous reagent.<br>
The solution synthesis described by Bauer and Pless in Patent No. U.S. 4,395,403 and EP029579 uses BTFA/TFA to remove the methoxybenzyl group protecting the thiol group of cysteine, followed by cyclization. Decomposition of tryptophan is frequently known to occur during such harsh acid treatment for removal of protecting groups.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
This invention describes a process for obtaining octreotide scalable upwards to kilogram quantities by solution chemistry methods using mild reagents and giving good yields. The process includes the following:<br>
1)      Cysteine thiol groups are protected by acetamidomethyl (Acm) groups. Treatment of the Cys(Acm)- containing linear novel octapeptide (XVI) of the<br>
3<br><br>
invention with iodine, in one step removes the Acm groups and simultaneously effects cyclization to give octreotide (I) in 80-90 per cent yield.<br>

2) The suitably protected octapeptide alcohol (XVI) of the invention is prepared by either of the following processes.<br>
a)	Sodium borohydride reduction of the novel C-terminal dipeptide methyl ester (X) to obtain the dipeptide alcohol (XI) (step 10). The Boc group is removed and the dipeptide (XII) on condensation with the hexapeptide acid (XIV), followed by deprotection, gives the novel intermediate (XVI) (Method 1-Steps 14 and 15)<br>
b)	Sodium borohydride reduction of the octapeptide XIX with methyl ester at C-terminal to give the novel intermediate XVI (Method 2-Step 19)<br>
The novel hexapeptide fragment XIV is prepared by condensation of two appropriately protected novel tripeptide fragments V and IX followed by saponification (Steps 12 and 13).<br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention The process for the synthesis of<br>
H-(D)-Phe-Cys-Phe-(D)-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-OL.<br>
of formula 1 comprises the synthesis of appropriate peptide fragments using the standard processes of peptide chemistry, known to the practitioners in the art. Thus amino functions of amino acids are protected with one of the commonly employed protecting groups like t-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl, and the carboxyl functions of amino acids are protected with alkyl groups like methyl, ethyl, or aralkyl groups like benzyl.<br>
The condensation of the carboxyl group of the amino protected amino acid with the amino group of carboxyl protected amino acid is typically carried out by dissolving the respective appropriately protected amino acids in approximately equimolar quantities in a nonpolar solvent preferably like tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, and adding a condensing agent such as N,N-dicyclocarbodiimide (DCCI), 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt) or Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino) -phosphonium hexafluorophosphate ( BOP ) in approximately equimolar quantity at a temperature of -10°C to + 10°C and stirring at 20°C -30°C for 4 to 24 hrs.<br>
Alternately the carboxyl function of the amino protected aminoacid is activated as mixed anhydride by addition of an alkylchloro-formates wherein alkyl means methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc, preferably isobutylchloroformate, a tertiary amine such as TEA, DIEA, NMM, preferably NMM, in approximately equimolar quantities in a nonpolar solvent like dichloromethane, THF, chloroform, preferably THF at a temperature of-10°C to + 10°C following by addition of carboxyl protected amino<br>
5<br><br>
acid carrying a free amino group and stirring at 20°C - 30°C for 4 to 24 hrs. The amino or the carboxyl protecting group is then selectively removed by the use of appropriate deprotecting agents known to those skilled in the art and condensed as desired with another amino acid derivative in an iterative procedure until the desired sequence is obtained.<br>
The basic difference from other procedures already described is that a) the cysteine thiol groups are protected by acetamidomethyl (Acm) groups, b) the N-terminal hexapeptide has been synthesised by condensation of two tripeptide fragments, c) the C-terminal dipeptide alcohol is generated by sodium borohydride reduction of dipeptide methyl ester X instead of using threoninol as the starting material, d) treatment of the linear octapeptide alcohol XVI of the invention with iodine, in one step, removes the Acm groups and simultaneously effects cyclization to give octreotide in good yield, and e) the key intermediate octapeptide alcohol XVI could also be prepared by sodium borohydride reduction of octapeptide methyl ester XIX.<br>

The following preferred embodiment is described. As shown in step 9, cysteine carrying Boc group for Na and Acm group for side chain SH protection may be treated with IBCF, NMM, H-Thr-OMe.HCl and TEA, all in approximately equimolar amounts in THF at - 10°C to give dipeptide methyl ester X. The C-terminal methyl ester is converted into alcohol function by reduction with sodium<br>
10<br><br>
borohydride (2 equivalents) in 90% EtOH at 0°C to give dipeptide alcohol XI (step 10). The Boc group is removed by treatment with TFA at 0°C and the resultant compound XII is condensed with appropriately protected hexapeptide XIV, using DCC/HOBt as the condensing agents, in approximately equimolar amounts in THF/DMAc at 0°C, to give the protected octapeptide alcohol XV (step 14). Boc groups are removed by treatment with TFA at 0°C to give the novel octapeptide alcohol XVI (step 15) which is cyclised with iodine (5-10 equivalents) in 90% MeOH to give octreotide I (Step 20).<br>
Alternately as shown in step 17 (method 2) Boc protection is removed from dipeptide methyl ester X by treatment with TFA at 0°C and the resulting t dipeptide ester XVII is condensed with the hexapeptide XIV, using DCC/HOBt as the condensation agents in approximately equimolar amounts in THF at 0°C ,to give the protected octapeptide methyl ester XVIII. Boc groups are removed by treatment with TFA at 0°C and the octapeptide methyl ester XIX on reduction with sodium borohydride (5 to 6 equivalents), in 90% EtOH gives the novel octapeptide alcohol XVI (see steps 18 and 19) which is cyclized with iodine (5 to 10 equivalents) to octreotide I (Step 20).<br>
The hexapeptide acid XIV of the invention is synthesised by condensation of two appropriately protected tripeptide fragments V and IX followed by saponification as shown in steps 12 and 13.<br>
For synthesis of tripeptide fragment V, cysteine carrying Boc group for Nα and Acm group for side chain SH protection is treated with IBCF, NMM, H-Phe-OMe.HCl and TEA, all in approximately equimolar amounts in THF/DMSO at -10°C to give dipeptide II (step 1). The Boc group is removed from the protected dipeptide methyl ester II by treatment with TFA at 0°C to give III (step 2) which<br>
on condensation with (D)-phenyl-alanine carrying Boc group as Nα protection and<br>
11<br><br>
using IBCF and NMM to make the mixed anhydride, in approximately equimolar amounts in THF at -10° gives protected tripeptide methyl ester IV (step 3). The saponification of IV gives the protected tripeptide acid V (step 4).<br>
Similarly for synthesis of tripeptide fragment IX, lysine carrying Z and Boc group at Na and Ns respectively as protecting groups is treated with IBCF, NMM, H-Thr-OMe.HCl and TEA, all in approximately equimolar amounts in THF/DMSO at -10° to give dipeptide VI (step 5). The Z group is removed from dipeptide VI by hydrogenation over Pd/C to give VII (step 6) which on condensation with (D)-tryptophan carrying Z group as Nα protection and using IBCF and NMM in approximately equimolar amounts in THF/DMSO to make the mixed anhydride, at -10°C gives protected tripeptide methyl ester VIII (step 7). Removal of Z group from VIII by hydrogenation over Pd/C provides the fragment IX (step 8).<br>
The hexapeptide methyl ester XIII is then made by condensing the tripeptide V carrying the free carboxyl function and the tripeptide IX, carrying the free amino function and using DCCI and HOBt as the condensation reagents in approximately equimolar amounts in THF/DMA at 0° (step 12). The methyl ester group of XIII is removed by saponification to give the hexapeptide acid XIV (step 13).<br>
