On this day personally appeared before me who, after being duly sworn, deposes and states:<br>
That I, Charles Sitch, Authorized Officer of LAWYERS' AND MERCHANTS' TRANSLATION BUREAU declare<br>
That to the best of my knowledge and belief, the attached document, prepared by one of its translators competent in the art and conversant with the German and English languages, is a true and correct translation into the English language of the accompanying document.<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a nutrient medium, in particular a cell culture medium, for the cultivation of at least one cell and/or for obtaining a polypeptide, protein and/or a vaccine from organisms, in particular from cells or from cell cultures, the organisms being cultivated in the nutrient medium according to the invention, and the desired polypeptide, protein or vaccine being obtained from the organisms and/or the culture supernatant.<br>
It was found, surprisingly, that the addition of organic acids or salts, derivatives or complexes of organic acids, selected from the group comprising citric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, a-keto-glutaric acid, fumaric acid, oxalacetic acid, isocitric acid, oxalosuccinic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, lactic acid to a nutrient medium increased the growth and/or the productivity of the cells and/or reduced the formation of toxic metabolites. The increase in productivity and/or decrease in formation of by-products produced according to this aspect of the invention can be achieved if the substances according to the invention are added on their own to a nutrient medium, in particular a cell culture medium, or are combined with one another, or are combined with other carbohydrates, in particular if the substances are added to a medium containing little if any glutamine, or are used with a medium that contains glutamine substitutes.<br>
The substances according to the invention are used as modulators of cell metabolism. They act as additional sources of energy and/or carbohydrates. In this connection the substances can be used in a nutrient medium, in particular in a cell culture medium, at correspondingly higher concentration, which contains carbohydrates and/or glutamine. The substances according to the invention can, however, also be used in a nutrient medium, in particular in a cell culture medium, containing no carbohydrates and/ or no glutamine.<br>
State of the art<br>
Animal cells, in particular mammalian cells, are being used increasingly as host cells in the production of vaccines, for example viruses or polypeptides. Continuously growing cells are generally used for this, i.e. cell lines that are either immortalized cells or tumor cells. For some applications, primary cells are used, which are taken for example directly from humans or animals. There are large differences between primary cells and cell lines, when they are cultivated in vitro. The primary cells can only divide a few times, whereas cell lines can divide practically infinitely often. There can also be a difference in cell metabolism between primary cells and permanent cell lines, for example glucose consumption rate, lactate formation rate and glutamine consumption rate.<br>
One objective of process optimization in the use of cells, in particular mammalian cells is to try to increase the integral of viable cell concentration in the cultivation system, i.e. the integral from the viable cell concentration curve and the time curve, since the integral of viable cell concentration has positive correlation with product concentration, for example with the polypeptide concentration (Renard, J.M., et al., Biotechnology Letters, 1988, 10(2): 91-96). The integral of viable cell concentration<br><br><br>
can be increased either by increasing the viable cell concentration or by lengthening the process time.<br>
The process time can be prolonged if the cells remain alive for a long time in the bioreactor, i.e. if the vitality of the cells remains high for a long time, or alternatively if the stationary phase is lengthened. If the vitality is low, there are many dead cells in the culture, which undergo lysis during fermentation and release cell-specific proteins. In its turn, a higher total specific-protein content in the culture makes purification of the desired polypeptide more difficult. There are several explanations for the decrease in vitality and hence short process time: in a nutrient medium, in particular in a cell culture medium, a substrate may have a limiting effect, the cells may enter into apoptosis because of the physical fermentation conditions, or byproducts of metabolism may accumulate in the medium, and exert a toxic action on the cells.<br>
It would be desirable to have a nutrient medium or a method in which cell vitality remains high for a long time, i.e. in which the stationary phase is lengthened, as the highest viable cell concentration is already attained in the stationary phase. Lengthening of the stationary phase leads to an increase of the integral of viable cell concentration and to increased product formation. Another parameter for increasing the integral of viable cell concentration is an increase in the peak cell density. The peak cell density can be increased further by means of better nutrient media and better methods of cultivation.<br>
The peak cell density or cell vitality is a function of the cell metabolism. If the cells have an inefficient metabolism, they excrete energy-rich intermediate metabolites, such as lactate, into the medium. Cells can also excrete toxic intermediate metabolites into the medium, such as ammonium. In its turn, ammonium can adversely affect cell growth, productivity and product quality, for example glycosylation. For example, when cells with high glycolytic activity metabolize glucose, there is a shift in the intracellular concentration of the glycolytic intermediates. This can affect the expression profile of various genes that are necessary for stress stability, productivity and growth (Verstrepen, K.J., et al., Trends Biotechnol., 2004, 22 (10): 531-537). In such conditions the integral of viable cell concentration is low, with consequent reduced product formation. Compared with primary cells, permanent cell lines are known to have a degenerated cell metabolism. In this connection, a number of enzymes of primary metabolism were compared between cell lines and primary cells. No activity of enzymes that link glycolysis with the citrate cycle could be detected in the cell lines tested, whereas they were present in primary cells (Neerman, J. and Wagner, R., J. Cell. Physiol., 1996,166 (1): 152-169). In many continuous mammalian cells the flux from glucose to lactate is high, whereas the flux from pyruvate to the citrate cycle is low. Glucose is largely converted to lactate by the cells and then the energy-rich lactate is excreted into the nutrient medium, in particular into a cell culture medium. Apart from glucose, the cell lines metabolize glutamine at a high rate as an energy source. Therefore both substrates, glucose and glutamine, are among the most important substrates in nutrient media for continuous mammalian cells.<br><br><br>
There have been several attempts to improve the cell metabolism of permanent cell lines. Limiting the glucose and glutamine in the process was tried as a means of restricting the glycolytic flux. Substrate restriction was presumed to suppress the overflow metabolism of the cells, so that the cells would produce less lactate and ammonium (US 2004/0048368 Al; Europa, A.F., et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 2000, 67(1): 25-34). The effect of glutamine restriction on the growth and apoptosis of CHO cells was investigated closely. It was shown that with glutamine restriction the cell growth rate decreases, but the proportion of cells entering apoptosis is lower (Sanfeliu, A. and Stephanopoulus, G., Biotechnol. and Bioeng., 1999, 64(1): 46-53). In WO 98/41611 it was proposed to regulate the glucose and glutamine concentration to a low value. This should take place through coupling of the glucose or glutamine concentration with the oxygen consumption rate. A prerequisite for this procedure is complex regulation and replenishment of the substrates, so that the process is difficult to control, especially in large-scale conditions. The risk of a fermenter breakdown and the associated financial risk is high. On the other hand EP 0435911 Bl teaches that inter alia glutamine must be increased in standard cell culture media in order to achieve improved cell growth and increased product formation. Similarly, the replenishment of animal cells with glutamine is considered to be necessary in fed-batch or in perfusion for the production of biopharmaceuticals (Duvar, S. et al., Transkript, 2004, 5(1): 34-36). Thus, there are contradictory statements in the literature concerning the role of glutamine with respect to cell metabolism.<br>
Chen, K., et al. (Biotechnol. Bioeng., 2001, 72: 55-62) tried to suppress lactate formation by homologous recombination. A copy of the lactate dehydrogenase gene was inactivated and consequently the cell-specific lactate formation rate was reduced by 50%. Irani, N., et al. 0. Biotechnol., 1999, 66: 238-246) cloned the pyruvate carboxylase gene into a cell line. The expectation was that the cells would then deliver more pyruvate into the citrate cycle and therefore produce less lactate. According to EP 0 338 841 Al the glutamine synthetase gene was cloned in cells as a selection marker. This had the advantage that no external glutamine had to be added to the nutrient medium. Cells produced glutamine themselves and excreted little ammonium.<br>
Altamirano, C. et al. (Biotechnol. Progress, 2000, 16(1): 69-75) replaced glucose and glutamine with alternatives that are difficult to metabolize, in this case with galactose and glutamate, in a low-protein medium in batch conditions. As a result, the cells did indeed produce less metabolic byproducts, but both cell growth and product formation were lower than in the control. Development of a two-phase process was also proposed: cells should grow in glucose initially, and then utilize galactose as source of carbohydrate in the production phase (Altamirano, C, et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 2001, 76(4): 351-60; Altamirano, C, et al., J. Biotechnology, 2004, 110(2): 171-9).<br>
US 4,049,494 describes a serum-free, chemically defined and autoclavable nutrient medium. The medium possesses the property that it is glutamine-free and at the same time contains glucose and pyruvate. The medium was specially developed for virus production with baby hamster kidney cells. Similarly, WO 03/106661 A2 describes a substrate combination for the cultivation of mammalian cells. The combination comprises a glutamine-free and at the same time pyruvate-containing<br><br><br>
nutrient medium. This substrate combination is said to reduce the formation of lactate and/or ammonium. It was shown that a combination of 1 mM pyruvate with 5.5 mM glucose in a nutrient medium promotes the maturation of cumulus-cell-enclosed mouse oocytes. Interestingly, little if any effect of glutamine on the maturation of the cells could be demonstrated (Downs, S.M. and Hudson, E.D., Zygote, 2000, 8(4): 339-51). Hassel, T. and Butler, M. (J. Cell Science, 1990, 96 (Pt3): 501-8) replaced glutamine with glutamate or 2-oxoglutarate in a nutrient medium and adapted cells to this medium. After the adaptation phase the McCoy cells used produced less lactate and ammonium. It must be emphasized that in this instance the cells grew on microcarriers and were either in the later exponential growth phase or in the stationary phase. The cells have an altered metabolic profile in these growth phases. In addition, pre-adaptation of the cells to glutamine-free medium was necessary.<br>
In a special nutrient medium, glutamine was removed from the nutrient medium. Without cell adaptation, the clone under investigation simply grew in the special nutrient medium. As a result ammonium formation was reduced and product formation was increased (Deer, F., and Cunningham, M., Genetic Eng. News, 2000, 20(7): 42). Kurano, N., et al., 1990 (Journal of Biotechnology, 15(1-2): 113-28) replaced glutamine with asparagine. A CHO culture was supplemented with asparagine in fed-batch conditions and in glutamine-free conditions and ammonium formation was reduced.<br>
In addition, glutamine was replaced in nutrient media with dipeptides, alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gin) or glycyl-glutamine (Gly-Gln). It was shown that owing to this strategy the cells produced less ammonium (Roth, E. et al., In vitro cellular &amp; developmental biology, 1988, 24(7): 696-698; Christie, A. and Butler, M., J. Biotechnology, 1994, 37(3):277-90). Glutamine was replaced with the stable glutamine alternative L-alanyl-glutamine (Glutamax) in order to investigate the effect of glutamine restriction with this substance (Sanfeliu, A. and Stephanopoulus, G., Biotechnol. and Bioeng., 1999, 64(1): 46-53).<br>
Another combination of substances that is said to reduce glucose consumption and lactate formation was disclosed in EP 1 342 780 Al. According to this, free unbound citrate in combination with iron citrate bound in a complexing agent is to be added to the nutrient medium.<br>
In a nutrient medium (perfusate), lactate and pyruvate in 10:1 ratio were supplied as substrate to rat heart cells. Lactate was used because lactate is a preferred substrate of the heart cells. It was shown that the glycolytic flux had been inhibited through addition of lactate (Depre, C et al., Acta Cardiologica, 1993, 48(1): 147-64; Ovchinnikov, I.V. and Kim, N.P., Ukrainskii Biokhimicheskii Zhurnal, 1985, 57(4): 72-5).<br>
The action of succinate, malate, lactate and pyruvate on hamster embryos was investigated in a chemically defined, protein-free medium. It was shown that succinate and malate in the nutrient medium support the development of blastocytes<br><br><br>
(Ain, R. and Seshagiri, P.B., Molecular Reproduction &amp; Development, 1997, 47(4): 440-7). In this work the focus was on developmental biology, in particular the development of blastocytes (primary cells).<br>
It was reported that the CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells are not able to utilize ribose, lactose, sucrose, glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, citrate, succinate, fumarate or malate as energy source (Faik, P. and Morgan, M.J., Cell Biol. Int. Reports, 1977,1(6): 555-62). It was found, surprisingly, that precisely these substances can be utilized by cells, in particular by CHO cells, as substrate if, according to the invention, the correct concentration is selected and moreover the correct concentration of amino acid (glutamine, glutamate, asparagine) and source of carbohydrate are selected.<br>
Acetate was added to the nutrient medium on the basis that it increases productivity performance of the cells in a comparable manner to butyrate (WO 03/064630). Glucose was combined with another C2-carbon source so as to be able to select a genetically altered yeast strain (WO 2004/099425). In this work, however, the focus is on a method for selecting a new yeast strain, not for the cultivation of an organism.<br>
Technical problem<br>
The technical problem forming the basis of the invention is the provision of an improved-yield nutrient medium, in particular a cell culture medium, a cell culture and a method for the cultivation of cells or cell cultures, in particular for the production of biological products from cells or cell cultures, in which the integral of viable cell concentration of a cell culture is increased, and accordingly a larger amount of desirable biological product can be obtained for the entire duration of the process. It is also further desirable that the nutrient medium, in particular the cell culture medium, can be used for cells that have one or more possibly even not precisely localized metabolic blockades in the glycosylation pathway or in the energy metabolism pathway in particular in the citrate cycle or glycolysis or have a blockade in the transport of metabolites from the medium into the cell, and/ or inside the cell between the organelles.<br>
The invention is therefore also based on the technical problem of providing a nutrient medium for the cultivation of cells or cell cultures, also of cells with metabolic blockade in the glycosylation pathway or in the energy metabolism pathway, e.g. in the citrate cycle or glycolysis, or of cells that have a blockade in the transport of metabolites from the medium into the cell, and/or inside the cell between the organelles, in which cell growth is improved, or the formation of metabolic byproducts is reduced, and accordingly a larger amount of desirable biological product can be obtained for the entire duration of the process.<br>
The invention is also based on the technical problem of providing methods of selection of special cells, in particular genetically modified and/ or metabolically altered, in particular optimized, cells.<br><br><br>
It was found, surprisingly, that the addition of organic acids or salts, derivatives or complexes of organic acids, selected from the group comprising citric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, a-keto-glutaric acid, fumaric acid, oxalacetic acid, isocitric acid, oxalosuccinic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, lactic acid to a nutrient medium, in particular to a cell culture medium, increased the growth and/or the productivity of the cells and/or reduced the formation of toxic metabolites. Organic acids or salts or complexes of organic acids, selected from the group comprising succinic acid, malic acid, a-keto-glutaric acid, fumaric acid, oxalacetic acid, isocitric acid, oxalosuccinic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, and lactic acid, are preferred according to the invention.<br>
The increase in productivity and/or decrease in formation of byproducts produced according to this aspect of the invention can be achieved if the substances according to the invention are added on their own to a nutrient medium, in particular a cell culture medium, or are combined with one another, or are combined with carbohydrates, or without carbohydrates, are added in the medium, in particular if the substances are added to a medium that contains glutamine, or does not contain glutamine, or are used in a medium that contains glutamine substitutes, or does not contain glutamine substitutes, or has a high asparagine concentration, or contains asparagine substitutes, or has a high glutamate concentration, or contains glutamate substitutes.<br>

Preferably, according to the invention, the biological product can also be the cell itself, for example it can be a primary cell, a stem cell, a union of primary cells, a tissue constituent, or a complete tissue.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, the at least one cell contains at least one gene, which encodes the biological product. The gene can be a foreign gene, i.e. a gene that does not occur naturally in the production cell or the gene can be a cell-specific gene, which occurs naturally in the production cell. Said cell-specific gene can for example be present actively or inactively in the production cell. When the cell-specific gene was inactive, the gene could have been activated through external intervention.<br>
According to the invention, a method is also provided for the cultivation of at least one cell as a cell culture, the at least one cell being cultivated in a nutrient medium, in particular in a cell culture medium, and preferably, according to the invention, its cell growth is stimulated by a method according to the invention.<br>
According to the invention, a method is also provided for obtaining a biological product from at least one cell, the at least one cell being cultivated by a method according to the invention and the biological product is obtained therefrom.<br>
It was found, surprisingly, that these particular organic acids (citric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, a-keto-glutaric acid, fumaric acid, oxalacetic acid, isocitric acid, oxalosuccinic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, lactic acid) promote cell growth and/ or polypeptide production and/or suppress the formation of metabolic byproducts, especially when higher concentrations are used. In particular, when these components are used in a glutamine-free or low-glutamine nutrient medium, or are used in a medium with high asparagine concentration, or asparagine substitute concentration, or are used in a medium with high glutamate concentration, or with high glutamine substitute concentration, or are used in a medium with or without glucose, or are used with galactose. In this respect the present invention differs from the teaching according to EP 0 435 911 Bl. In the cited patent specification it is proposed to use higher glutamine concentration (greater than 8 mM) in media, whereas the present invention claims preferably a reduced glutamine concentration, in particular a glutamine-free nutrient medium.<br>
In EP 0 435 911 Bl (page 8, line 14, and page 14), the components succinate, malate, a-keto-glutarate, fumarate and citrate were tested as chelators for metal ions in a nutrient medium, in particular in a cell culture medium. On the basis of the experiments that were conducted, it was found that citrate is a good chelator for metal ions (page 22, Claim 5). Apart from citrate, the other organic acids tested do not appear to have provided a satisfactory result. As the objective, in EP 0 435 911 Bl, was to find a good metal chelator, very low concentrations of the organic acids tested were used (malate = 10.7 mg/1, a-keto-glutarate = 5.9 mg/1, succinate =<br><br><br>
0.96 mg/1, fumarate = 0.88 mg/1). Moreover, in EP 0 435 911 Bl these substances are used explicitly in a medium with a glutamine concentration of more than 8 mM, because that is the invention of that specification. Another difference between the teaching of EP 0 435 911 Bl and of the present invention is that the substances according to the invention are used as modulators of metabolism. In this connection, the substances can preferably be used in a nutrient medium, in particular in a cell culture medium that contains carbohydrates and/or glutamine. The organic acids can, however, also preferably be used in a nutrient medium, in particular in a cell culture medium that does not contain any carbohydrates and/or does not contain glutamine. In EP 0 435 911 Bl the main energy and carbon sources of the cells are glucose and glutamine, so that the substances at the low concentration are of no significance as modulators of metabolism.<br>
It was found, surprisingly, that in fact one of the best known metabolic byproducts of cells, namely lactate, promotes cell growth and the integral of viable cell concentration. It is stated in numerous works that lactate is a metabolic byproduct and is even said to be toxic to the cells. It was found, surprisingly, that lactate has a positive effect on cell growth, when the nutrient medium, in particular the cell culture medium, does not contain glutamine or contains a low concentration of glutamine, for example contains a glutamine concentration of less than 8 mM, or when glutamine has been replaced with glutamine-containing glutamine substitutes, or when the medium contains asparagine, especially when asparagine is present at higher concentration, e.g. the asparagine concentration is higher than 0.3 g/1, or when asparagine has been replaced with asparagine-containing substitutes, or when the medium contains glutamate, especially when the glutamate concentration is higher than 0.3 g/1, or when glutamate has been replaced with glutamate-containing substitutes, or the medium has been formulated with or without glucose, especially when the medium is glucose-free, in particular when the medium contains galactose. The positive effect of lactate is especially evident when the medium does not contain any glutamine and contains carbohydrates other than glucose as a source of carbon, especially when the medium contains galactose.<br>

The lactate concentration is at least 0.1 g/1, preferably at least 1 g/1, especially preferably at least 5 g/1, most preferably at least 25 g/1.<br>
The growth stimulation through addition of the aforementioned substances to the nutrient medium that is especially preferred according to this aspect of the invention is achieved because the nutrient medium and/or feed medium is free from glutamine or glutamine-containing substitutes.<br>
The growth stimulation through addition of the aforementioned substances to the nutrient medium, in particular to the cell culture medium, that is especially preferred according to this aspect of the invention is achieved because the feed medium contains glutamine-containing glutamine substitutes. The concentration of glutamine-containing glutamine substitutes in the feed medium is preferably at least 0.2 g/1, more preferably at least 1 g/1, especially preferably at least 5 g/1, most preferably at least 10 g/1.<br>
The growth stimulation through addition of the aforementioned substances to the nutrient medium, in particular to the cell culture medium, that is especially preferred according to this aspect of the invention is achieved because the feed medium contains asparagine or asparagine substitutes. The concentration of asparagine or asparagine substitutes in the feed medium is preferably at least 0.2 g/1, preferably at least 1 g/1, especially preferably at least 5 g/1, most preferably at least 10 g/1.<br>
The growth stimulation through addition of the aforementioned substances to the nutrient medium, in particular to the cell culture medium, that is especially preferred according to this aspect of the invention is achieved because the feed medium contains glutamate or glutamate substitutes. The concentration of glutamate or glutamate substitutes in the feed medium is preferably at least 0.2 g/1, more preferably at least 1 g/1, especially preferably at least 5 g/1, most preferably at least 10 g/1.<br>

The concentration of lactate or lactate derivative in the feed medium is preferably at least 1 g/1, more preferably at least 5 g/1, especially preferably at least 25 g/1, most preferably at least 100 g/1.<br><br>
The growth stimulation through addition of the aforementioned substances to the nutrient medium, in particular to the cell culture medium, that is especially preferred according to this aspect of the invention is achieved because the feed medium is glucose-free. The glucose concentration in the feed medium is preferably at most 100 g/1, preferably at most 25 g/1, especially preferably at most 5 g/1, most preferably at most 1 g/1.<br>
The growth stimulation through addition of the aforementioned substances to the nutrient medium, in particular to the cell culture medium, that is especially preferred according to this aspect of the invention is achieved because the feed medium contains galactose. The galactose concentration in the feed medium is preferably at least 1 g/1, preferably at least 5 g/1, especially preferably at least 25 g/1, most preferably at least 100 g/1.<br>
A third aspect of the invention relates to a cell or a cell culture, which is characterized in that the cell culture can survive or can divide in a medium with substances according to the invention or its peak cell density is increased, or its stationary phase is lengthened or its death phase is slowed down, or its formation of the byproducts of cell metabolism, for example ammonium or lactate, is reduced.<br>
Owing to the stimulation of growth through the addition of the substances according to the invention to the nutrient medium, in particular to the cell culture medium, according to the invention, preferably in high-cell-density fermentation (highest total cell concentration attained during fermentation for example in particular &gt;lxl05 cells/ml, preferably &gt; lxl06 cells/ml in large-scale conditions (working volume &gt; 11, for example 30 - 20 000 1) the peak cell density can be increased, or the stationary phase can be lengthened, while cell vitality remains high for longer, i.e. the integral of viable cell concentration is increased and hence product yield is increased.<br>
The method according to the invention is basically suitable for the production of any polypeptides, proteins or vaccines, for example for virus production. However, polypeptides that can be glycosylated or cannot be glycosylated are preferred. The polypeptides can for example be natural, human polypeptides or recombinant variants of human polypeptides.<br>
The nutrient medium according to the invention is preferably suitable for the production of polypeptides with post-translational modifications, in particular for the production of glycoproteins. Addition of the substances according to the invention to a nutrient medium, in particular to a cell culture medium, can promote or inhibit particular glycosylation pathways and can therefore be favorable for the formation of a desired glycostructure of the desired polypeptide or of the vaccine. The substances according to the invention can, individually or in combination with one another, promote or inhibit a particular post-translational modification in the cell, with the result that the desired polypeptide variants or vaccine variants are expressed in production. For example the substances according to the invention can increase protein sialylation or protein galactosylation.<br><br><br>
Through the use of the substances and nutrient media according to the invention, the variation in pH value of the cell cultivation process is very atypical at the upper end of the required value. It is usual in cell cultivation processes for the pH value of the process to start with pH 7.0 to pH 7.1, and for the cells to excrete acids, in particular lactate into the culture as a result of their metabolic activities. Therefore there is normally a shift of the pH value of the culture toward the acid range. It was found, surprisingly, that the pH value shifts toward more basic pH values when using the cell cultivation process according to the invention on account of the altered metabolism of the cells. Without being bound to the theory, this might be associated with the fact that the cells have a better metabolism and no longer excrete acids into the culture. Conversely, they metabolize acids. That is further evidence that the cells have a different metabolism owing to the substances and methods according to the invention. As a consequence, the pH value of the culture is at pH values above 7.2 (higher than pH 7.2 or to put it another way, more basic than pH 7.2). This is beneficial for protein glycosylation, for example, but not limited to this, for protein galactosylation or for protein sialylation. In their turn, some intracellular glycosylation enzymes are more active at pH values more basic than 7.2, leading to greater glycosylation of the proteins being produced. That is an important process property, resulting from the metabolism of the substances according to the invention.<br>
Therefore a fourth aspect of the invention is a method of cultivation using the aforementioned culture media, in which the pH value of the cell cultivation process is preferably more basic than pH 7.2, in particular more basic than pH 7.3, more preferably more basic than pH 7.4, most preferably more basic than pH 7.5, very preferably more basic than pH 7.6, most preferably more basic than pH 7.7.<br>
The method according to the invention is basically suitable for the cultivation of prokaryotic cells, for example bacteria, or eukaryotic cells, for example yeasts or animal cells. The term "animal cell" covers nonmammalian cells and mammalian cells. Examples of nonmammalian cells are cells of Spodoptera frugiperda, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopicrus. Preferred organisms for this invention are, however, mammalian cells. The mammalian cells can be primary cells, but permanent cell lines are preferred. The suitable permanent cell lines can for example be of human origin, for example PER-C6, human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065), human lung cells (W138, ATCC CCL 75), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa, ATCC CCL 2). The permanent cell lines can, however, also be of animal origin, for example derived from mouse or hamster, for example SV-40 immortalized monkey kidney cells (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651), canine kidney cells (MDCK), monkey kidney cells (CV1, ATCC CCL 70), African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10),<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-DG44, Urlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1980, 77: 4216, or CHO-DUKX, or CHO-Kl with ATCC-number of ATCC CCL 61), lymphocytic cells (Jurkat T-cell line), buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442), mouse mammary tumor cells (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL 51), SP2/0 cells, myeloma cells (for example NS0), hybridoma cells and trioma cells. The hybrid cell lines can originate from any species, including human and mouse. The descendants<br><br><br>
of the aforementioned cells are also suitable in cultivation in nutrient media according to the invention and methods according to the invention.<br>
The cells that are preferred according to this invention are, however, from a mammalian cell line and are not hybridoma cells. The cell lines that are especially preferred according to the invention are all variants of the CHO, NSO, PERC-6 and BHK-21 cell lines, the cell lines being transformed with an exogenous nucleic acid, where the exogenous nucleic acid codes for the polypeptide of interest. "Exogenous nucleic acid" means a nucleic acid sequence that is not present in the host cell. The exogenous nucleic acid can also be homologous to a nucleic acid of the host cell, but which does not normally occur in this position in the host cell.<br>
The cells that are preferred according to this invention are able to survive or to divide in the media with substances and methods according to the invention or their peak cell density is increased, or their stationary phase is lengthened or their death phase is slowed down, or their formation of byproducts of cell metabolism, for example ammonium or lactate, is reduced. The metabolism of the cells may be adapted in media with substances according to the invention or in methods according to the invention. This adaptation can take place through targeted molecular-biological alteration of the cells or through the adaptation of the cells in the media and methods according to the invention.<br>
The term "clone" means a descendant of a parent cell, for example one of the cell lines enumerated above. A clone can arise when a cell possesses other cellular properties and so differs from the original parent cell. Usually clones can arise after a gene transfer of the parent cell, for example through transfection.<br>
The term "metabolic optimization" means adaptation or change of cell metabolism to the desired conditions. The adaptation or change of cell metabolism can be achieved through targeted genetic intervention in the host cell, cloning certain genes into the cell, or switching-off certain genes. Or the adaptation or change of cell metabolism can be achieved when the cells are cultivated in the desired process conditions and/or in nutrient media, so that the cell itself adapts to the altered conditions. Through cultivation in the new conditions, novel cells can develop, which can be selected and isolated, which are genetically modified. The genetic modification is manifested for example as a change, in particular an improvement of cell metabolism. In particular, said cells with said altered cell metabolism grow especially well in comparison with conventional cells in the desired conditions, because their metabolism has been optimized.<br>
A product according to the invention is a polypeptide, a protein or a virus, which is expressed in the cells and is harvested from the cultivation system, i.e. the cells and/or the cell medium. It can be any protein of interest. It can for example be diagnostic or therapeutic proteins, such as interleukins, enzymes, multimeric proteins or subunits of multimeric proteins, as well as antibodies or antibody fragments. The recombinant gene for the protein of interest can contain a signal sequence that is responsible for the excretion of the protein of interest from the host<br><br><br>
cell. The protein can be expressed from a transgenic promoter or its naturally active gene locus, and an immunoglobulin gene locus in hybridoma cells. The protein can also be expressed from a host-specific promoter, for example when a CHO cell is used for protein production, the foreign gene from a CHO promoter can be expressed. However, the product can also be a vaccine, for example a virus or viruslike particle, which is capable of replicating with the aid of a host cell.<br>
The cells to be cultivated can be adherent or can grow on microcarriers, but cells growing in suspension are preferred. Moreover, the cells can grow in serum-containing culture media (for example in fetal bovine serum, FBS, also called FCS), but a medium that does not contain serum and is called "serum-free" is preferred. Cells in serum-free media may need insulin and transferrin for optimal growth. Transferrin can be replaced at least partially with alternatives, for example with iron citrate. Most of the cell lines need one or more growth factors, comprising the recombinant polypetides or proteins as growth factor. The medium can contain polypeptides, but a low-polypeptide or a polypeptide-free or a protein-free medium is preferred. When the medium contains a polypeptide, a polypeptide produced by recombinant means is preferred. The medium can contain peptones, which can be of animal origin, but peptones of yeast origin are preferred, and peptones of plant origin are especially preferred. It is preferable to use culture media that are peptone-free and are fully defined chemically.<br>
"Nutrient medium", also known as "culture medium" or "cell culture medium" by a person skilled in the art, means a medium that is used for the storage and/or cultivation of cell cultures or of at least one cell. A liquid nutrient medium, also called culture fluid, is preferred as the nutrient medium according to the invention. The term "nutrient medium" is used here as a generic term for all media. Nutrient medium comprises, for example, but is not limited to, the terms "basal medium" (culture medium), "feed medium" and "perfusion medium". A nutrient medium is thus a fluid that contains nutrients for cells. The substances according to the invention can be present in a nutrient medium together with other cellular nutrients. However, it is possible that the substances according to the invention are not present in a nutrient medium, and instead are added from another solution, for example from a stock solution to a nutrient medium with or without cells external to the culture. In this way the substances according to the invention do not come into contact with the cells directly via a nutrient medium, in particular via a cell culture medium, but indirectly. To that extent a method of contacting the cells with substances according to the invention is also a part of the invention. "Nutrient medium", "culture medium" or "basal medium" means a medium, in particular a culture fluid, which promotes cell growth and/or cell vitality and/or product formation. The culture medium is preferably liquid.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, a high-cell-density cell culture medium is used, for supplying the necessary nutrients to a population of animal cells so as to reach, in a defined period of cultivation, a viable cell concentration of at least lxl05/ml, preferably at least lxl06/ml. Culture media that supply such high cell densities   with   nutrients   are   supplemented   for   example   with   the   following<br><br><br>
substances: at least one amino acid, usually several amino acids and even all amino acids including cystine; at least one energy source, usually a source of carbohydrate, for example glucose, inorganic salts, vitamins, for example vitamin C and/ or vitamin E; trace elements, also defined as inorganic components that are present at micromolar concentrations; buffers, up to four nucleosides or nucleotides, antioxidants and glutathione; lipids, for example cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine or lipid precursors for example choline or inositol. A high-cell-density medium preferably has at least one of the components enumerated above added to it, and can contain the components enumerated above at high concentrations.<br>
The nutrient medium, in particular the cell culture medium, can optionally be supplemented with one or more or all components of the following categories:<br>
a)	Hormones and other growth factors, for example IGF-1, insulin, transferrin, epidermal growth factor<br>
b)	Salts and buffers, for example calcium, magnesium, and phosphates<br>
c)	Nucleosides and bases, for example adenosine, thymidine, hypoxanthine<br>
d)	Protein and tissue hydrolyzates.<br>
The formulation of the culture media, to which substances according to the invention can be added, can preferably correspond to one of the published formulations. The formulations of the media can preferably be used in the published manner, but often they are modified and adapted to the requirements of the cell used. Examples of suitable published formulations of culture media are: Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 Medium, L-15 Medium, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), Ham's F12 Medium, or Iscoves' Modified DMEM. These published formulations of media can be used alone or mixed in any proportions as basal medium powder. The formulation of the culture media, to which the substances according to the invention can be added, can especially preferably be a commercial nutrient medium, whose recipe has not been published, for example, but not limited to, CD-CHO Medium from GIBCO, Ex-Cell 325 PF CHO Medium from Sigma (Cat. No.: 14340C).<br>
"Feed medium" is a medium that is added to the cultivation system during cell cultivation, i.e. feed media are added to cultivation systems after the cells have come into contact with another medium, for example a culture medium (basal medium). Feed media contain substances that promote cell growth and/or cell vitality and/or product formation. By adding the feed media, the process time can be extended, because cell vitality can remain high for longer. The feed media can contain one or more energy sources, for example carbohydrates, for example glucose. Glucose can be contained in the feed medium or can be fed separately from another stock solution into the cultivation system. The feed medium can contain one or more amino acids. Feed media can only contain essential amino acids or only nonessential amino acids, or also a mixture of the two groups of amino acids. The feed medium can contain glutamine, or can be glutamine-free or can contain glutamine substitutes, or can contain glutamine-containing glutamine substitutes or can contain a mixture of glutamine and glutamine-containing glutamine substitutes. Glutamine can thus be combined in the feed medium with other substances, or can be fed separately<br><br><br>
from a stock solution as single substance into the cultivation system. Feed media can be just single concentrates of the basal medium, but feed media that are more than singly concentrated, for example doubly or more highly concentrated forms of the basal medium, are preferred. Feed media recipes are similar to basal media recipes, i.e. as a rule the feed media contain the same or a proportion of the substances that are present in basal media. Feed media can differ from basal media with respect to their inorganic components. They can for example be a basal medium without salts, or a low-salt variant of the basal medium. Feed media can, however, also include substances that are not present in basal media recipes.<br>
"Glutamine-containing substances", "glutamine derivatives" or "glutamine-containing glutamine substitutes" mean substances that contain D- or L-glutamine, in particular L-glutamine in a molecule. This molecule can contain D- or L-glutamine in a great variety of ways, for example, but not limited to this, glutamine can be bound covalently to another substance. In particular, "glutamine-containing substances", "glutamine derivatives" or "glutamine-containing glutamine substitutes" mean peptides or oligopeptides from D- or L-glutamine (Roth, E. et al., In vitro cellular &amp; developmental biology, 1988, 24(7): 696-698). For example, glutamine can be replaced with glutamine-based dipeptides, for example alanyl-glutamine (Ala-Gin) or glycyl-glutamine (Gly-Gln) (Christie, A. and Butler, M, Journal of Biotechnology, 1994, 37(3): 277-90; Sanfeliu, A. and Stephanopoulus, G., Biotechnol. and Bioeng., 1999, 64(1): 46-53; (Kurano, N., et al., J. Biotechnology, 1990, 15: 113-128). The term "glutamine-containing substances" is also described in WO 03/106661 (page 7, line 1).<br>
"Asparagine substitutes", "asparagine derivatives" or "asparagine-containing asparagine substitutes" mean substances that contain D- or L-asparagine, in particular L-asparagine in a molecule. This molecule can contain D- or L-asparagine in a great variety of ways, for example, but not limited to this, asparagine can be bound covalently with another substance. In particular, "asparagine substitutes", "asparagine derivatives" or "asparagine-containing asparagine substitutes" mean peptides or oligopeptides from D- or L-asparagine. For example, but not limited to this, Leu-Asn (Sigma, catalog number: L0641), or Ile-Asn (Sigma catalog number: 13635), or Glu-Asn-Gly (Sigma, catalog number: P5148). The peptides can basically contain 2 or more than 2 amino acids.<br>
"Glutamate substitutes", "glutamate derivatives" or "glutamate-containing glutamate substitutes" mean substances that contain D- or L-glutamate, in particular L-glutamate in a molecule. This molecule can contain D- or L-glutamate in a great variety of ways, for example, but not limited to this, glutamate can be bound covalently with another substance. In particular, "glutamate substitutes", "glutamate derivatives" or "glutamate-containing glutamate substitutes" mean peptides or oligopeptides from D- or L-glutamate. For example, but not limited to this, Asp-Glu (Sigma, catalog number: A1916-250MG), Glu-Glu (Sigma, catalog number: G3640-25MG), Glu-His (Sigma, catalog number: G6882-100MG), Glu-Leu (Sigma, catalog number: G7007-10MG), Glu-Lys (Sigma, catalog number: G5136-25MG). The peptides can basically contain 2 or more than 2 amino acids.<br><br><br>
"Lactate substitutes", or "lactate-containing lactate substitutes" or "lactate derivatives" mean substances that contain D- or L-lactate in a molecule, for example, but not limited to this, iron(II) lactate hydrate (Sigma, catalog number: 44953), or manganese(II) lactate trihydrate (Sigma, catalog number: 13227) or lactose. The molecule can contain D- or L-lactate in a great variety of ways, for example, but not limited to this, lactate can be bound to another substance, for example, but not limited to this, (+) ethyl D-lactate (Sigma, catalog number: 69796). Lactate derivatives are also molecules that can easily be converted intracellularly to lactate, for example, but not limited to this, pyruvate or alanine. In this case pyruvate can be added to the nutrient medium. Extracellular pyruvate is easily transported into the cell and converted to lactate by pyruvate dehydrogenase. In the case of alanine, extracellular alanine can be transported into the cell and converted to lactate by alanine transaminase via a pyruvate intermediate stage. This also applies to alanine-containing peptides, therefore alanine-containing peptides are also defined as "lactate derivatives".<br>
The term "split ratio", also called "dilution factor", is a criterion for expressing the split ratio of two liquids. When two liquids are to be mixed together, in order to reach a target concentration, the solutions are mixed in proportions with a split ratio. Split ratio will be explained with the following example: a cell culture was inoculated in a culture vessel at a cell concentration of 2 x 105/ml and left to grow for 3 days. On the third day the cell concentration of 20 x 105/ml was measured. This culture is diluted with fresh medium, so that the target inoculation concentration of 2 x 105/ml is reached again. In this case the matured culture (inoculum) must be diluted 1:10 with fresh medium. If a working volume of 1 1 is required in the new culture, it is necessary to use 100 ml inoculum and 900 ml fresh medium. In this case we would have a split ratio of 1:10.<br>
All process variants in which cells are cultivated in order to produce a desired polypeptide, protein or a desired vaccine, are basically suitable for the application of the invention. However, a method that is preferred according to the invention is a high-cell-density method. The high-cell-density cell culture method is defined as a method in which, in a defined period of cultivation, a viable cell concentration of at least lxl05/ml, preferably at least lxl06/ml is reached, where the culture can be expanded by a single cell or by another cell culture or by an inoculum. Operating modes that are preferred according to the invention are continuous culture, fed-batch, batch, perfusion, or split-batch processes.<br>
Cultivation is preferably carried out in a batch process, with all of the components for cell cultivation being placed in the culture vessel at the start of the process. In batch processes the cells are inoculated in a suitable medium and are harvested after a certain cultivation time. Then the desired product, for example a polypeptide, is isolated from the culture.<br>
A method that is especially preferred according to the invention is a fed-batch process, in which the cells are brought into contact with another nutrient medium, for example with a feed medium, between inoculation and the end of the process.<br><br><br>
A fed-batch process starts, for example, but not limited to this, with a basal medium. The cells are inoculated in the basal medium. After a certain time, for example, but not limited to this, 1-4 days after inoculation, the culture is contacted with another nutrient medium, for example this nutrient medium can be a feed medium. The feed medium can be added batchwise, at intervals or continuously at a set dose, to the cell culture. Therefore the volume of the culture increases during cultivation.<br>
Another method of cultivation that is suitable according to the invention is perfusion, in which the cells, after a growth phase in a culture medium, are supplied with further fresh medium for example with perfusion medium, whereas the spent medium, with or without cells, is withdrawn from the process. Perfusion media may be different from culture media (basal media), or the same basal medium can also be used as perfusion medium. In perfusion methods the cells are first inoculated in a basal medium. In the course of cell cultivation, the cells (biomass) are separated from the cell culture (cell suspension) and on the one hand the spent medium is withdrawn from the process, and on the other hand new nutrients are made available to the cells through fresh medium. If cells are retained in the culture system during the process, this is called "perfusion". If cells are removed from the system with the spent medium during the process, this is called "continuous method". In perfusion processes, the cells can also be removed from the cultivation system at defined time intervals, so as to be able to maintain a maximum cell concentration. To a person skilled in the art, this operation is known as "bleeding". Cell separation is carried out with various technologies, with some technologies promoting cell separation indirectly. Examples of some possible methods of cell separation are filtration, cell encapsulation, cell adherence to microcarriers, cell sedimentation or centrifugation.<br>
Another suitable method according to the invention is the split-batch process (repeated batchwise operation) with or without feeding of the cells. In this method, after a growth phase a portion of the cell suspension is harvested and the rest of the cell suspension is left in the fermenter as inoculum of the next batch operation. The fermenter, with this inoculum, is then filled again to the desired working volume with fresh medium and the second batchwise operation thus begins.<br>
The removal of samples from the cultivation system for offline measurements during the aforementioned operating modes has nothing to do with the method of cultivation that is described. Its only purpose is better understanding or control of the process.<br>
The term "harvesting" or "cell harvesting" is an indication of the end of a production batch in an upstream process. In a batch and fed-batch process, the upstream process can only end with one harvest, whereas in split-batch, perfusion and in continuous methods there can be several harvests. Depending on the operating mode selected, the cell cultivation process (upstream process) can contain a lag phase, an exponential phase, a stationary phase and a death phase. The fermentation process can be ended in one of these growth phases. Preferably the fermentation process is ended in the stationary phase or in the death phase. At the end of the upstream<br><br><br>
process the cells are separated from the suspension. This cell separation process is called "harvesting" or "cell harvesting" here. Cell harvesting is followed by other purification steps so that the product can be isolated.<br>
The term "inoculation" means the inoculating of a new cultivation system (for example a bioreactor and a suitable nutrient medium, in particular a cell culture medium) with cells. The inoculum, i.e. the cells or the cell suspension, are prepared beforehand for this purpose. Usually the cells that are to be inoculated are expanded before the actual production process, so that we have enough cells to be able to inoculate the new cultivation system with the desired cell concentration.<br>
"Cell growth" means an increase in the viable cell concentration in at least one of the cultivation phases. The term "cell vitality" expresses the ratio of the viable cell concentration to the total cell concentration, which also includes the dead cells. This ratio can also be calculated in any way or means. One method is marking of the cells with a dye to differentiate the live and dead cells. One example for distinguishing between dead and live cells is the use of trypan blue dye. The marked cells are then counted and the number of dead and live cells is determined. Cell vitality is calculated by finding the ratio of the live cell count to the total cell count.<br>
The term "osmolality" is a measure of the osmotic pressure of the dissolved particles in an aqueous solution. The dissolved particles include both the ions and the unionized molecules. Osmolality is expressed as the concentration of osmotically active particles, dissolved in 1 kg of water (1 mOsmol/kg H2O at 38°C is equivalent to an osmotic pressure of 19 mmHg). The term "osmolarity" means the number of particles that are dissolved in 1 1 of solution. Substances that occur in culture media and that increase the osmolality of the solution are therefore, for example, proteins, peptides, amino acids, unmetabolizable polymers, vitamins, ions, salts, sugars, metabolites, organic acids, lipids, etc.<br>
The term "pH value" is the negative common logarithm of the numerical value of the molar hydrogen ion activity aH+ (pH = -log aH+). Solutions with a pH value of less than 7.0 have an acid reaction, with a pH value of 7.0 they are neutral. Solutions with a pH value greater than 7.0 have a basic reaction. When pH values of two solutions are compared, the solution with the higher pH value is defined as "more basic" relative to the solution with lower pH value, e.g. solution 1 has a pH value of 6.8, solution 2 has a pH value of 7.0. In this case solution 2 is more basic compared with solution 1. The pH values of the production processes can be measured in various ways. For example, but not limited to this, the pH value of a bioreactor can be measured on-line with a pH-electrode. Another method of determining the pH value of the culture is off-line sampling and detection of the pH value with an external pH-electrode.<br>

Material and methods<br>
Cell culture conditions<br>
Cells were stored in the gas phase of liquid nitrogen. One to two ampoules were thawed in nutrient medium preheated to 37°C and transferred to spinner bottles, shaking flasks or T-bottles. In the first few days of cultivation the medium was changed, depending on the clone.<br>
Depending on the clone, cells were split either every second day or every third day or after two and three days alternately into new medium, i.e. a portion of the cell suspension was removed from culture and a smaller portion of the cell suspension was reused as inoculum for the next culture. This inoculum was made up with fresh<br><br><br>
prewarmed nutrient medium. Cells were incubated at 37°C in an incubator with a CO2 atmosphere. An alternative for incubating cells was cultivation in an incubation chamber at 37°C, in this way cells were held in culture for several passages. A passage means a cultivation time of two to three days. At various points of time, cell suspension was taken from strain maintenance and used as inoculum for experiments. The experiments were carried out in various cultivation systems, for example in spinner bottles, T-bottles, shaking flasks, culture tubes or in controlled bioreactors.<br>
A CHO cell line that expresses an antibody was used for the experiments. The product concentration (antibody concentration) in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA.<br>
A CHO medium from the company Sigma (CR 1020, Lot: 64K2403) was used as nutrient medium (basal medium) for the experiments. This is a serum-free, protein-free nutrient medium. It is a ready-made, sterile-filtered nutrient medium.<br>
The experiments were carried out either in batch mode or in fed-batch mode. When the process was carried out in fed-batch mode, the process was first started in batch mode in the above-mentioned basal medium and cells were cultivated in this manner for 1-4 days. After 1-4 days the cells were supplemented with a feed medium, i.e. the process was switched to fed-batch mode. Feed took place at regular intervals. In fed-batch experiments, a protein-free and serum-free feed medium from the company HyQ (R05.2 supplement, Cat. No.: SH30584.04, Lot No.: APF21457G) was used.<br>
All substances (chemicals) used according to the invention were obtained from the company Sigma and stock solutions were prepared from them. From the stock solutions, the substances were put at the desired final concentration in culture tubes. The various culture tubes prepared in this way were finally inoculated with the antibody-producing CHO-clone at a target inoculation cell concentration (1-3 x 105/ml). For this, the corresponding amount of inoculum cells was calculated and the required amount of inoculum cell suspension was centrifuged. The cell pellet was finally taken up in the corresponding volume of fresh nutrient medium without substances according to the invention (Sigma, CR 1020, Lot: 64K2403). In this way the desired inoculation cell concentration was adjusted in the cell suspension being investigated. The cell suspension thus prepared was proportioned in the culture tubes, which were provided with the substances according to the invention beforehand. The culture tubes were incubated at 37°C, and 8% CO2 atmosphere, with shaking. The culture tubes were cultivated for 8-11 days in the batch mode or in the fed-batch mode. Samples for offline measurement of the variables were taken from the culture vessels at regular intervals, for example daily or on every third day. The metabolic variables and cell concentrations of the samples were measured. Cell concentration and cell vitality were measured with a CeDex instrument. The metabolic variables (glucose, lactate, glutamine and ammonium) were determined with an analyzer (BioProfile 100).<br><br><br>

Example 5: Routine cultivation of the metabolically optimized cells in strain maintenance with substances according to the invention in a glucose-free and glutamine-free nutrient medium (basal medium)<br>
A glucose-free and glutamine-free commercial nutrient medium was obtained. This medium was supplemented according to Table 6 with substances according to the invention to provide the final nutrient medium. The concentration of the substances shown in Table 6 is the final concentration of the respective substances in the medium. This nutrient medium corresponds to a serum-free, protein-free, peptone-free medium with substances according to the invention. The final nutrient medium for cell cultivation is thus glucose-free, glutamine-free, contains galactose and contains lactate.<br><br><br><br>
Table 6: Composition of the nutrient medium (basal medium) for the routine cultivation of CHO cells with substances according to the invention in strain maintenance<br>
The metabolically optimized CHO cells were cultivated in shaking flasks under batch conditions for strain maintenance. Cells were inoculated in the aforementioned nutrient medium with an inoculation cell concentration of 1-2 x 105 live cells per ml. The culture was incubated at 37°C and at 7.5% pCC»2 atmosphere for 2 days and the culture was subcultured on day 2. For this, on day 2 the cell concentration was counted and a cultivation vessel was inoculated with the same inoculation cell concentration in the same fresh medium. A cultivation period of two days was defined as one passage. The culture was cultivated in this way for several passages and the viable cell concentration was determined in each passage, shortly before subcultivation. The values found were plotted in a diagram (Fig. 1). It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the cells can grow well in the medium according to the invention. Cells have a doubling time of 17.9 hours in the medium according to the invention. Cells have a high split ratio of 1:6.3 in a cultivation mode of 2 days. If cells in strain maintenance are split every third day, they have a split ratio of more than 1:10. This high split ratio, or low doubling time is attained in a serum-free, protein-free, peptone-free, glucose-free, and glutamine-free medium.<br>
Next, the second group of fed-batch experiments was carried out. The following materials and methods were used in all experiments starting from here (Examples 6 to 9):<br>
The first nutrient medium that was used is a commercial nutrient medium (basal medium). This basal medium is a glucose-free and glutamine-free basal medium, whose recipe is not known. This basal medium was supplemented in the respective examples with substances according to the invention. The stated concentration of the substances in the examples is the final concentration of the respective substance in the basal medium. Therefore, if necessary, the nutrient media were supplemented with substances according to the invention until the stated final concentration was reached. After supplementation, the pH value of the basal medium was adjusted to 7.1 ±0.1. The osmolality of the basal medium was adjusted to 310 ±20 mOsmol/kg H2O. Thus, the final basal medium was prepared and sterile-filtered. The basal medium prepared in this way corresponds to a serum-free, protein-free and peptone-free basal medium.<br>
The second nutrient medium used is a feed medium. It is a serum-free, protein-free feed medium. The feed medium is of our own formulation, consisting inter alia of amino acids, salts and vitamins. This feed medium was supplemented with substances according to the invention in the respective examples. The stated concentration of the substances in the examples is the final concentration of the respective substance in the feed media. The final feed medium had a pH value of 6.0 to 7.8 and an osmolality of 460-750 mOsmol/kg H2O.<br>
All experiments were carried out in fed-batch conditions.<br><br><br>
The experiments were started by inoculating the basal media with CHO cells. The inoculation cell concentration was 1-3 105/ml. The cultures were left to run for up to 7 days and were fed with the corresponding feed medium at regular intervals during cultivation.<br>
The terminology used in the experiments is explained in the following examples. For example, name of the experiment S4:MEL-St-MEL.<br>
S4: number of the experiment. It varies from SI to S6<br>
First abbreviation (MEL): specification of the cells used. This can either be MEL<br>
(metabolically engineered), or St (standard, wild-type).<br>
Second abbreviation (St): specification of the basal medium used. This can be either<br>
MEL (basal medium according to the invention), or St (standard basal medium).<br>
Third abbreviation (MEL): specification of the feed medium used. This can be either<br>
MEL (feed medium according to the invention), or St (standard feed medium).<br>
In the method according to the invention it was necessary to feed cells with lactate, as they need lactate as a source of carbohydrate. These feed media, or the cultures that had been fed with extra lactate, were noted in media tables with the comment "Extra feed". The reason is that lactate belongs to the stated feed media. However, lactate was not added to the feed media, in order to avoid solubility problems. Instead, the lactate concentration was determined daily and was added, if needed, (before the lactate limit) from a separate stock solution of the culture.<br>
Example 6:   Fed-batch experiment with the substances according to the invention, without glucose and without glutamine in nutrient media<br>
The following combination of media was used for this fed-batch experiment:<br><br>

The results show that the metabolically optimized cells in nutrient media according to the invention display cell growth comparable to the control (Fig. 2). In contrast to the control, they produce less ammonium (Fig. 4) and they metabolize lactate, whereas the control produces lactate (Fig. 3). The pH value of the culture with substances according to the invention shifts to basic pH values (to higher pH values) or remains constant. The pH value of the control (conventional method) shifts to acid pH values (low pH value) (Fig. 5).<br>

In the prior art, several combinations of carbohydrates have been tested in basal media and feed media. All the combinations envisaged inoculation of the cells in a basal medium containing glucose. Then a fed-batch process was started, in which the feed medium contains e.g. galactose. The reason for this type of procedure is that the cells have a low growth rate in galactose-containing basal medium, or do not grow at all, therefore it was necessary to start with glucose-containing basal medium (Altamirano, C, et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 2001, 76(4): 351-60; Altamirano, G, et al., J. Biotechnology, 2004,110(2): 171-9; Altamirano, C. et al., Biotechnol. Progress, 2000, 16(1): 69-75). According to the present invention, however, cell growth rate in galactose-containing medium is comparable to that in glucose-containing medium,<br><br><br>
so that a basal medium with substances according to the invention offers entirely new possibilities for cell cultivation. Therefore a basal medium according to the invention was combined here with various feed media.<br>
It can be seen from the results that the feed medium according to the invention can be combined better with basal medium according to the invention (Fig. 6, comparison S6:St-St-MEL versus S6:St-MEL-MEL). The basal medium according to the invention can, however, be combined well with a standard feed medium, since the feed medium contains a carbohydrate other than galactose, e.g. glucose. Especially if the basal medium contains the substances according to the invention and the feed medium contains glucose, the cells grow to even higher cell concentration (Fig. 6, comparison S6:St-MEL-MEL versus S6:St-MEL-St).<br>
A similar experiment was also carried out with metabolically optimized cells (Fig. 7). The nutrient media of the fed-batch experiment with metabolically optimized cells were as follows:<br><br>
	Glucose	Galactose	Lactate	Glutamine	Glutamate	Asparagine<br>
