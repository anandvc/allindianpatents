Process for continuously preparing N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP) Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the continuous preparation of N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP) by reacting gamma-butyrolactone with monoethyiamine in the liquid phase.<br>
Owing to particular advantageous properties, NEP is an important, versatile solvent and reaction medium for the chemical industry.<br>
Owing to, inter alia its favorable toxicological properties, it can advantageousiy substitute other solvents; cf. WO-A-05/090447 (BASF AG).<br>
JP-B-74 020 585 (Mitsubishi Chem. Ind. Ltd.) describes the preparation of pyrrolidones from GBL and primary alkylamines in the presence of water at from 200 to 300°C.<br>

EP-A-1 201 652 (Dairen Chem. Corp.) describes a process for preparing lactams from lactones in the presence of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite catalysts and water,<br>
It has been recognized according to the present invention that the prior art suffers from, inter alia, the following disadvantages:<br>
a)	low space-time yields of NEP,<br>
b)	the use of relatively large amounts of water in the synthesis, which leads,<br>
 <br>
inter alia, to tow space-time yields of NEP and high energy costs for the preheating of the starting material and the work-up of the reaction product mixture, and<br>
c) the large molar excess of monoethylamine baaed on GBL, which results in a high engineering outlay in the work-up of the reaction product mixture and recovery of the unreacted monoethylamine and thus high capital and energy costs.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome one or more disadvantages of the prior art and discover an improved, selective process for preparing NEP in high yields and space-time yields (STYs) and high quality (e.g. purity of &gt; 99.5% by weight, APHA color number of 
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for the continuous preparation of N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP) by reacting gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) with monoethylamine (MEA) in the liquid phase, wherein GBL and MEA are used in a molar ratio in the range from 1:1.08 to 1:2 and the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range from 320 to 420°C and an absolute pressure in the range from 70 to 120 bar.<br>
i     The reaction according to the present invention is preferably carried out at a<br>
temperature in the range from 330 to 410°C, in particular a temperature in the range from 340 to 380°C, very particularly preferably at a temperature in the range from 345 to 370°C, e.g. in the range from 350 to 366°C.<br>
i     The reaction according to the present invention is preferably carried out at an absolute pressure in the range from 70 to 110 bar, in particular an absolute pressure in the range from 80 to 110 bar, very particularly preferably an absolute pressure in the range from 80 to 105 bar, e.g. in the range from 90 to 100 bar.<br>
)     The molar ratio of the starting materials GBLimonoethylamine in the process of the present invention is preferably 1 :(1.01-2.0), further preferably 1:(1.02-1.5), in particular 1 :(1.03-1.3), very particularly preferably 1 :(1.04-1.2), most preferably 1 :(1.04-1.15), e.g. 1:1.14.<br>
5     The feed mixture preferably comprises less than 40% by weight, e.g. less than 15% by weight, particularly preferably less than 10% by weight, very particularly preferably less than 5% by weight, in particular less than 1 % by weight, e.g. from 0 to 0.9% by weight, of water at the reactor inlet. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the feed mixture does not comprise any water.<br>
)<br>
The process of the present invention can, for example, be carried out as follows:<br>
 <br>
The reactor employed is preferably an upright, slender high-pressure tube which is equipped, after a heat exchanger with bypass, with a depressurization valve controlled via a pressure regulator. The feed streams are preferably preheated by the output from the reactor, so that the reaction temperatures specified according to the present invention can be set in the reactor by means of the heat evolved in the reaction. The reactor is preferably provided with a plurality of sieve trays to prevent backmixing and to improve the establishment of plug flow (effectively a cascade of stirred vessels). The number of sieve trays can be, for example, from 10 to 40, preferably from 20 to 30.<br>
The MEA is preferably used in aqueous solution, e.g. as a 60-80% strength by weight solution, preferably as a 
The MEA is preferably used in a purity (calculated on a water-free basis) of &gt; 90% by weight, in particular &gt; 98% by weight, very particularly preferably &gt; 99.8% by weight.<br>
Liquid monoethylamine, if appropriate mixed with recovered monoethylamine from the work-up (see below), is preferably fed by means of a pump, e.g. a diaphragm pump, oreferably via a recuperative heat exchanger W and preferably via a, for example, steam-operated heater to the bottom end of the reactor, preferably tube reactor (preferred upflow mode of operation).<br>
GBL is likewise fed by means of a pump, e.g. a diaphragm pump, preferably via a, for example, steam-operated heater into the bottom end of the reactor, preferably tube reactor, with mixing of the starting materials taking place and the starting materials GBL and monoethylamine being present in the abovementioned inventive molar ratio.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the liquid monoethylamine and the GBL are fed separately into the tube reactor in the center of the bottom of the reactor via a two-fluid injector. While the GBL is introduced through the central nozzle at a high flow velocity (preferably 4-12 m/s), the liquid monoethylamine flows into the reactor through an annular gap around the outside of this nozzle. The starting materials are introduced as a driving jet into a circulation tube which is located in the inlet region of the reactor, encompasses about one third of the free cross section of the tube reactor and has a length of preferably from 1.5 to 2.0 m. The recirculation of liquid which occurs on the outside of the circulation tube and is maintained by means of the driving jet leads to intensive initial contact of the reactants in the above-described, inventive molar ratio.<br>
Continuous exothermic reaction of the GBL with monoethylamine in the liquid phase to form NEP occurs in the reactor under the abovementioned temperature and pressure<br>
 <br>
conditions.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the absence of a catalyst.<br>
The space velocity through the reactor is preferably In the range from 0.5 to 2 kg of GBLy(lreaclor • h), particularly preferably from 1.0 to 1.5 kg of GBL/(i,eactor • h).<br>
The mean residence times of the reaction mixture in the reactor or, if a plurality of reactors is used (cf. below), in all reactors are, on the basis of the density of GBL and monoethylamine (liquid) at room temperature (20°C), are preferably from 10 to 60 minutes, preferably from 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the throughput.<br>
The space-time yields of NEP in the output from the reactor are preferably &gt; 0.5 kg of NEP/(h  lreact0„ particularly preferably &gt; 1 kg of NEP/(h • lre3Ctor), more particularly preferably from 1 to 3 kg of NEP/(h • I,eacl0r), very particularly preferably from 1.1 to 2.5 kg of NEP/(h • !„), e.g. 2 kg of NEP/{h • lreac,0f).<br>
{Lactor = reactor volume in liters; in the case of a plurality of reactors, total reactor volume in liters).<br>
The reaction product obtained is preferably continuously depressurized from the reactor as feed to a distillation column K1, with all or part of the output from the reactor preferably firstly being passed through the recuperative heat exchanger W (see above) to heat the ethylamine and being cooled in the process.<br>
Overhead distillate from the distillation column K2 (main constituent: NEP, see below) can be mixed beforehand into the feed to the column K1 to recover the NEPs obtained in the overhead distillate from K2.<br>
In the distillation column K1, monoethylamine which is still present and water are distilled off, e.g. at from 40 to 240°C and from 1 to 2 bar. Energy can be supplied by means of a circulation vaporizer. The distillate is a preferably 15-30% strength by weight, in particular 15-25% strength by weight, e.g. about 20% strength by weight, aqueous monoethylamine solution. Anhydrous monoethylamine can be recovered from the solution by known methods.<br>
The distillation of the monoethylamine still present and the water in this distillation step is preferably carried out in the presence of from 0.05 to 1 % by weight, in particular from 0.05 to 0.2% by weight, very particularly preferably from 0.08 to 0.15% by weight, (in each case based on the amount of NEP in the feed to this distillation column) of hydroxides of the metals Na, K, Li, Ba or Ca.<br>
 <br>
The distillation of the MEA/water mixture in this distillation step is particularly preferably carried out in the presence of NaOH, which is metered as aqueous sodium hydroxide solution into the feed to the column K1 by means of a pump. For example, aqueous 25% strength sodium hydroxide solution is used in such an amount that the concentration of NaOH is from 0.05 to 0.2% by weight, in particular from 0.08 to 0.15% by weight (in each case based on the amount of NEP in the feed to this distillation step).<br>
It has been recognized according to the present invention that this particular way of carrying out the process results in acidic components present in the reaction product (which could cause corrosion problems in the apparatuses) and any residual traces of unreacted GBL being bound (reaction of the GBL to form the corresponding metal salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid), so that a particularly pure NEP is finally obtained.<br>
In a preferred procedure the bottoms are subsequently taken from the column K1, cooled if appropriate and conveyed by means of a pump to the column K2 for final distillation of the NEP. Pure NEP is isolated as a liquid stream at a side offtake of the column K2. The temperatures at the bottom are generally from 100 to 140°C at from 0.01 to 0.02 bar. (Boiling point of NEP: 212QC/1.013 bar). Here too, heat can be supplied by means of a circulation vaporizer. The overhead distillate which also comprises NEP together with MEA and water can be recirculated to the column K1 (see above) and/or to the reactor inlet.<br>
The overhead distillate from the column K1 is preferably passed to a column K3 in<br>
which the monoethylamine comprised in the distillate is recovered for reuse in the<br>
synthesis.<br>
The monoethylamine solution is also preferably dewatered in the column K3, after<br>
which the MEA obtained is fed to the process as fresh starting material.<br>
The process of the present invention gives NEP in yields of &gt; 96%, in particular &gt; 97.5%, very particularly &gt; 98%, after distillation.<br>
The conversion of GBL is preferably &gt; 99%, in particular &gt; 99.5%, very particularly preferably &gt; 99.9%.<br>
The selectivity (based on GBL) is preferably &gt; 96%, e.g. &gt; 97%, in particular z 98%, very particularly preferably &gt; 99%.<br>
The NEP obtained according to the present invention has a high quality after distillation:<br>
The purity is preferably &gt; 99% by weight, in particular &gt; 99.5% by weight, very<br>
 <br>
particularly preferably &gt; 99.8% by weight.<br>
The GBL content is preferably 
The APHA color number in accordance with DIN ISO 6271 of the NEP obtained according to the present invention is preferably 
The process of the present invention can also be carried out in an apparatus (tube reactor) as described in DE-A-17 95 007, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
The process of the present invention is preferably carried out in a single stage, i.e. in a reactor which may, for engineering reasons, be divided into two or more apparatuses (reactors), with the pressure and temperature conditions specified according to the present invention then prevailing in each of these reactors.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the process of the present invention, a plurality of reactors, in particular tube reactors, (e.g. two or three reactors, each as described above) operated in the upflow mode can be connected in series, with the pressure and temperature conditions specified according to the present invention prevailing in at least one of these reactors, preferably in the last of these reactors.<br>
An example of such a series arrangement of a plurality of reactors is given in WO-A-<br>
99/52867 (cf. the process flow diagram, reactors No. 5, 9 and 13, and the description in that document), which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
Examples<br>
The synthesis of NEP was carried out continuously under the conditions indicated below in a production plant which corresponded largely to the process concept described above, i.e. the starting materials GBL and MEA were preheated in a recuperative heat exchanger and two steam-heated heat exchangers and fed to the synthesis, in one of the columns following the synthesis, the excess ethylamine and the water introduced into the process were separated off and discharged from the process. In a second column, the removal of the residue and the pure distillation of the product were carried out. Work-up and reuse of the ethylamine separated off in the first column were dispensed with.<br>
 <br>
The reactor was operated in a singie pass in the upfiow mode. The starting materials monoethylamine (MEA) and GBL were preheated and conveyed by means of pumps to the reactor inlet where the two streams were mixed. The total water content of the starting materials was 14% by weight.<br>
