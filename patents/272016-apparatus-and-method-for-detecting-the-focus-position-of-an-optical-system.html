				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus and a method for detecting the focal position of an<br>
optical system. In particular, the invention relates to an apparatus and a method for detecting<br>
the depth of focus of an imaging optical system and moreover also to an apparatus and<br>
a method for controlling the focal position and in particular the depth of focus. Furthermore,<br>
the invention also relates to an ophthalmological treatment and/or diagnosis apparatus<br>
using said apparatus and/or said method.<br>
In the case of the optical systems under discussion here, the system in question is in particular<br>
an imaging optical system in a material processing installation using light sources,<br>
such as lasers and LEDs in particular. Material processing should be understood here to<br>
mean also material structuring in the microrange, e.g. for dielectric materials, such as<br>
biological tissue, or also metallic materials. In particular, the invention can be used in<br>
ophthalmological optical systems, especially in refractive corneal surgery, such as LASIK,<br>
for example. A particularly suitable application area for the present invention in this case<br>
is fs-LASIK, thus refractive corneal surgery using a femtosecond laser.<br>
In the aforesaid optical imaging systems, achieving highly precise material processing<br>
operations depends inter alia on exact control of the focal position. "Focal position" is<br>
understood here above all to mean not only the location of the focus in the direction of the<br>
optical axis (so-called depth of focus), however, but more generally also the position and<br>
orientation of the focused radiation, thus e.g. an offset in relation to the ideal optical axis<br>
of the system or angularity of the actual axis of the optical radiation in relation to the ideal<br>
(desired) optical axis. In fs-LASIK it is particularly important to adhere to the calculated<br>
depth of focus and this is a particular application of the present invention.<br>
In DE 10 2004 009 212 Al, an optical contact element for laser material processing is<br>
presented. This contact element is used in the preferred embodiment for fs-LASIK. In this<br>
case this contact element consists of a diffractive optical structure. These structures are<br>
intended to minimize the incidence angles occurring due to high numerical apertures of the<br>
lens. The diffractive optical element (DOE) consists here of a grating structure with radi-<br>
 <br>
ally adjusted grating period. The grating periods in this case are between 2001/mm and<br>
5001/mm. Values in the Î¼m range are indicated as spot sizes. Due to optical limits, only<br>
one numerical aperture of approx. 0.3 is possible. Enlargement of the aperture is achieved<br>
by using a second diffractive element in the beam path of the lens. This DOE is likewise<br>
executed as a circular grating structure with a grating period that becomes larger towards<br>
the optical axis. Achieving higher numerical apertures is indicated here as an advantage of<br>
this execution. Furthermore, the contact element is executed curved. The radius of curvature<br>
corresponds to the radius of curvature of the eye, approx. 8 mm. Material processing<br>
is carried out with this uniformly preset radius of curvature. The suction attachment is<br>
carried out similar to WO 03/002008 Al and EP 1 159 986 A2. Focus control is not carried<br>
out with this presented method.<br>
In EP 0 627 675 Al, a diffractive optical device is presented for the mapping of one or<br>
more space points from a beam. Here the diffractive structure likewise consists of a segment-like<br>
arrangement of arbitrary binary or multistage diffractive elements. The arrangement<br>
can be a hexagonal or hexangular arrangement in particular. Thus mapping of a<br>
light beam is achieved. However, only an intensity or/and phase transformation is undertaken.<br>
In US 2002/0171028, an apparatus for focus control is described. Here the returning light<br>
is brought by an imaging beam path to interference with a second bundle of rays and thus<br>
interferometric wave control is carried out.<br>
Focus control by means of interferometric wavefront control is carried out likewise in US<br>
6,666,857 B2. The active wavefront control during the photoablation process on the human<br>
eye is then achieved by a combination of adaptive mirrors. No active wavefront<br>
control is to be undertaken.<br>
In US 2004/0051976 Al, an optical arrangement of a confocal microscope, consisting of a<br>
laser source emitting predominantly in the UV spectral range, a beam expander, a diffractive<br>
pinhole array and an objective lens is described. A diffractive pinhole array is not<br>
 <br>
described in its exact embodiment. The increase in efficiency can be seen as one advantage<br>
of this technical embodiment, as amplitude pinhole arrays have a typical transmission<br>
of between 4% and 10% depending on the aperture ratio. With a diffractive pinhole array,<br>
on the other hand, transmission values of such an optical element of up to 80% are possible,<br>
dependence on the aperture ratio or the number of pinholes only being conditional on<br>
the manufacturing here.<br>
In US 2004/0021851, an optical arrangement consisting of a laser and subsequent beam<br>
shaping optics is used to measure the focal length of an unknown lens. Measurement of<br>
the focal length is carried out in this case by focusing on a reference surface at various<br>
distances. The portion of the radiation that is reflected back is detected. The spot diameters<br>
are then evaluated at the respective distances. The focal length is determined by<br>
means of the "Newton's" relation Z Z'=f2. An optical grating, which is not described in<br>
greater detail, is used to decouple the portion of the radiation reflected back. The Jones<br>
matrix formalism is likewise drawn on to calculate the focal length. The accuracy of the<br>
method is near 1%.<br>
In US 6,909,546 B2, an optical arrangement consisting of a light source (Nd:YAG2w) and<br>
subsequent beam shaping optics is described. In this case two diffractive optical elements<br>
are used to homogenize the laser radiation. The first of the two DOEs is used here for<br>
homogenization and spatial frequency filtering. A subsequent pinhole carries out the<br>
spatial frequency filtering. Located inside the 2f system of spatial frequency filtering is the<br>
second DOE, which produces the desired intensity distribution in the far field. The far<br>
field is produced either by the field lens or by the 2nd DOE. The desired intensity distribution<br>
is produced in the focus. Focus control is not carried out in this method.<br>
The object of the invention accordingly is to provide an apparatus and a method with<br>
which the focal position of an optical system can be determined precisely.<br>
To this end the invention provides an apparatus for detecting the focal position of an optical<br>
system with a radiation source, a focusing imaging system, an at least partially reflec-<br>
 <br>
tive surface on the focus, a suitable digital sensor system (e.g. CCD camera, CMOS camera<br>
or the like) for recording an image that is reflected by said surface, a computer for<br>
evaluating the image recorded by the camera, and an optical element in the beam path of<br>
the optical system upstream of the focusing image system, which optical element influences<br>
said image depending on the focal position.<br>
In this case said focusing optical imaging system is preferably focusing optics with adjustable<br>
(variable) focal position, thus in particular a system with which the location of the<br>
focus is adjustable in a direction parallel to the optical axis of the image (thus the depth of<br>
focus). In addition, in such a system the focal position is usually also adjustable in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the optical axis of the radiation, e.g. in fs-LASIK.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention and the corresponding method thus serve in<br>
particular for the initial setting and alignment of an optical system such that immediately<br>
prior to material processing in relation to a predetermined plane, the so-called surface, the<br>
focus is adjusted precisely, in particular so that it lies exactly on this surface. When used<br>
in LASIK, said null plane is preferably a surface that arises due to the fact that the cornea<br>
is attached by suction in the area of interest to a reference surface (this is known as such to<br>
the LASIK expert). The flattening disc, which is transparent for the radiation used, is<br>
coated on its side facing the cornea and lying close to this such that a small percentage of<br>
the incident radiation is reflected. This reflection then produces said image of the radiation<br>
focused onto this null plane, which image is measured using said camera and evaluated.<br>
In ideal focusing, the focus should therefore lie exactly on this null plane (thus<br>
essentially on the flattened cornea surface in the example shown) and according to the<br>
evaluation of the reflected image the optical system is then adjusted so that the focusing is<br>
optimal, thus the position of the focus is exactly in this null plane. The optical system is<br>
thus set and aligned and can be used for the subsequent material processing. In the subsequent<br>
material processing the position of the focus is usually changed in relation to said<br>
null plane. Thus in fs-LASIK, for example, when cutting the so-called flap the focus is<br>
placed in the stroma and the focus positions are varied successively at right angles to the<br>
 <br>
optical axis to produce the flap. This is known as such. The initial setting of the system as<br>
described above guarantees exact positioning of the foci at the desired target points.<br>
In other material processing operations the null plane, which can also be described as the<br>
reference plane, can be defined differently and does not necessarily have to coincide with<br>
the surface of the material to be processed. The radiation focused onto the null plane and<br>
the measurement of the image reflected in this plane supply calibration of the optical<br>
system such that the setting of the optical imaging properties of the optical system for the<br>
ideal state of focusing exactly in the null plane is known due to the image measurement, so<br>
that then, starting out from these settings of the optical system, the focal position can be<br>
changed according to the desired material processing, e.g. into the inside of the cornea.<br>
According to one configuration, said optical element, which influences the focus image to<br>
be measured depending on the focal position, is a diaphragm matrix (so-called pinhole<br>
array).<br>
The optical element can also be a so-called diffractive optical element (DOE), which<br>
produces a dot pattern in the far field distribution (known as such to the person skilled in<br>
the art and not explained in greater detail here).<br>
Said optical element can be arranged in the beam path of the reflected image between the<br>
reflective surface and the camera, or also outside this beam path. Advantages result in<br>
each case according to the type of application.<br>
The amplitude (intensity) or the phase (wavefront) of the reflected image can preferably be<br>
influenced locally with the optical element and the defocus portions of the wavefront can<br>
be rendered visible.<br>
It is also possible to provide said optical element in the beam path both phase-sensitively<br>
and amplitude-sensitively, in particular a combination thereof.<br>
 <br>
According to a preferred configuration, the optical element produces a dot pattern, in<br>
particular a regular dot pattern in the form of a matrix.<br>
The invention also provides a method for detecting the focal position of an optical system,<br>
in which the radiation of a radiation source is mapped via a focusing imaging system in a<br>
focal plane and wherein to determine the focal position of the optical system including the<br>
imaging system an image is produced on the focus, which image is reflected there and is<br>
recorded by a camera, wherein an optical element influences the recorded image depending<br>
on the focusing of the radiation, and depending on said influencing of the image, information<br>
about the focal position of the focused radiation at the envisaged focal point is derived.<br>
Practical examples of the invention are described in greater detail below with reference to<br>
the drawing.<br>

for detecting a focal position;<br>

the focal position;<br>

with schematic representation of phase distributions of the radiation in the system and with<br>
a hole matrix;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a practical example of an arrangement according to figure 2 with a diffractive<br>
optical element; and<br>
Figs. 5, 6 show practical examples of images recorded by a camera with focusing mapping<br>
in the manner of a hole matrix with exact focusing and/or focusing errors.<br>
 <br>
According to figure 1, an optical system 10 has a light source 12, which can be e.g. a laser<br>
(such as an fs-laser, for example) or an LED etc. The radiation emitted by the light source<br>
12 passes through an output mirror 14 and is focused via a focusing imaging system 16<br>
onto a plane 18. The focusing imaging system 16 is only indicated schematically in the<br>
figures by a single lens. Normally the focusing imaging system 16 has a plurality of<br>
lenses, of which one or more can be actuated for setting and changing the focus. Such<br>
optical imaging systems are known as such.<br>
In figure 1, areas (points) are marked by the reference signs 20a and 20b at which an optical<br>
element described in greater detail below is optionally to be positioned. Examples of<br>
such optical elements are the optical elements 34 and 36 shown in figures 3 and 4.<br>
Radiation reflected by the reflective surface 18 passes via the optical imaging system 16<br>
and if applicable the optical element arranged in area 20a and described in further detail<br>
below to the output mirror 14 and is deflected upwards from there in figure 1 via imaging<br>
optics 22 to a digital camera 24, e.g. a so-called CCD camera with high local resolution.<br>
The digital image recorded by the camera 24 is entered into a computer C and evaluated<br>
there, as described in greater detail further below.<br>
Figure 2 shows a modified practical example, with components and features having the<br>
same or similar functions being provided with the same reference signs. In the example<br>
according to figure 2, a beam expander (telescope) consisting of the optical elements 26,<br>
28 is provided to expand the beam prior to its focusing with the imaging system 16. Instead<br>
of the Keppler telescope shown in the figure, another beam shaping system can also<br>
be used in its place. Generally the optical system designated a "beam expander" in figure<br>
2 can also be a beam shaping system.<br>
As already mentioned above, an optical element can be arranged in the areas 20a and/or<br>
20b according to figures 1 and 2 that, depending on the more or less optimal focusing by<br>
means of the imaging system 16 onto the reflective surface 18, influences the image described<br>
above, which was produced by reflection and recorded by the camera 24, and so<br>
 <br>
facilitates a conclusion as to whether the focusing onto the plane corresponding to the<br>
surface 18 is precisely that which is desired or whether the focal position is displaced in<br>
relation to this plane, e.g. lies too far forward or too far back in the direction of the optical<br>
axis (so-called depth of focus).<br>
According to figure 3, a shadow mask 34 is arranged as an optical element in the present<br>
sense in the beam path upstream of the focusing imaging system 16.<br>
In the ideal case, the optical imaging system 16 is thus set such that the radiation coming<br>
from the light source 12 is focused precisely in the plane 18 at a predetermined point. The<br>
focus is marked in figure 3 by the reference sign 18a. The practical example according to<br>
figure 3 corresponds to the example according to figure 2 with a beam expander in the area<br>
indicated by reference sign 32. The phase distributions are also marked symbolically there<br>
by reference signs 30a, 30b, 30c.<br>
The optical element 34 is a hole matrix with N x M individual holes in the regular arrangement<br>
shown. The optical element can be executed in this practical example as a pure<br>
amplitude-related element, thus influencing intensities of the radiation. Typical hole diameters<br>
in the shadow mask lie between 1 Î¼m and 100 Î¼m. The holes can be in particular<br>
hexangular, square, hexagonal or also circular. The arrangement of the individual holes is<br>
oriented to the beam profile used and the requirements in respect of accuracy with regard<br>
to the focal position. With the system described, focal positions can be determined accurate<br>
to a few Î¼m. Since the radiation on the path to the plane 18 and the image reflected in<br>
the plane 18 each pass through the optical element 34, the image measured by the camera<br>
24 is influenced depending on the accuracy of the focusing in the plane 18. A change in<br>
the focal position in relation to the plane 18 (which is the null plane defined above) of a<br>
few micrometres can be detected by evaluation of the image recorded by the camera 24 in<br>
the computer C.<br>
It is also possible to determine the radiation output occurring in the focus by integration of<br>
the intensities measured by the camera 24 at the individual image points.<br>
 <br>
Fig. 5 shows, by way of example and schematically, reflection images obtained and evaluated<br>
in this manner. In this case figure 5 shows in the middle the matrix-like hole image<br>
obtained in the event that the optical system including the focusing imaging system 16 is<br>
set such that the focusing lies exactly on the desired point in the null plane 18. As stated,<br>
the reflective surface for producing the measured image also lies in this plane 18. As the<br>
hole image in figure 5, middle, shows, in the reflected image the individual holes are<br>
illuminated entirely homogeneously without a spherical portion, according to the input<br>
beam profile.<br>
In the left-hand hole image, figure 5 shows a displacement of the focal position backwards<br>
by approx. 100 Î¼m in relation to the null plane 18. Compared with exact focusing (figure<br>
5, middle), the image evaluation yields a modification of the individual image dots in the<br>
matrix and the computer C is calibrated for the evaluation such that it "recognizes" this<br>
deviation. The calibration of the computer can take place e.g. experimentally in such a<br>
way that using a known optical imaging system changes in the reflected image produced<br>
are recorded and stored specifically depending on the focal position, so that then the focal<br>
position can be determined by comparison with actually measured images.<br>
On the right, figure 5 shows defocusing by -100 Î¼m with a lens focal length of 50 mm<br>
with corresponding modification of the hole image compared with ideal focusing. Generally<br>
speaking, the asymmetry of the image, as shown to the left and right in figure 5, permits<br>
analysis of the focusing. If, on the basis of image evaluation using the computer C,<br>
this analysis results in an asymmetrical brightness distribution in the image, then elements<br>
of the focusing imaging system 16 can be changed until the image evaluation shows that<br>
the focus lies exactly in the plane 18.<br>
Figure 4 shows a practical example of the apparatus for detecting the focal position of an<br>
optical system 10, in which the optical element is arranged in area 20b in the practical<br>
example according to figure 2, thus in such a way that the image reflected on the plane 18<br>
does not pass through the optical element 36 on its way to the camera 24.<br>
 <br>
The optical element 36 in this case is a diffractive optical element (DOE), which forms e.g.<br>
a "1 to N" beam splitter, thus splits an incident single beam into N single beams, wherein<br>
N can vary e.g. between 2 and 50. The divergence caused by the diffractive element 36<br>
can be corrected refractively or diffractively by a second structure (not shown). Several<br>
diffractive optical elements can also be arranged one behind another, depending on the<br>
beam profile and desired analysis. An advantage of an arrangement with diffractive optical<br>
elements is the possibility of correction of the incident phase distribution. The phase<br>
distribution can be influenced by both the light source and the following optical elements,<br>
thus in particular the beam expander. In this practical example also, analogous to the<br>
description with reference to figure 3, the image reflected in the plane 18 is recorded by<br>
the camera 24 and evaluated in the computer C. Figure 6 shows three images recorded by<br>
the camera 24 in the event that the diffractive optical element produces a matrix-like radiation<br>
distribution, wherein the image on the right in figure 6 shows the case of ideal focusing<br>
with relatively uniform illumination of the individual image dots. In figure 6, left, the<br>
case is shown in which the focal position deviates laterally from the ideal imaging point<br>
18a, to be precise by several hundred micrometres. The individual image dots are illuminated<br>
asymmetrically. Figure 6, middle, shows a focal position displaced laterally in<br>
another direction, wherein the individual matrix-like light dots are likewise illuminated<br>
less symmetrically than in the case of ideal focusing according to the image in figure 6,<br>
right.<br>
An optical element 36 in the form of a DOE has the advantage compared with a hole matrix<br>
of high transmission. With a diffractive element, efficiency of between 80 and 90%<br>
can typically be achieved. Such an arrangement also facilitates very high dynamics in the<br>
evaluation of the focal position, i.e. deviations of the focus from the ideal target position<br>
can be established over a wide range.<br>
It is also possible to arrange the diffractive optical element 36 in the areas 20a according to<br>
figures 1 and 2.<br>
 <br>
The diffractive optical element can also be executed as a binary element or also as a so-<br>
called multi-level grating structure. The grating structures can be one-dimensional or also<br>
two-dimensional.<br>
If an arrangement according to figures 1, 2, 3 or 4 is used in fs-LASIK, then the reflective<br>
surface 18, which defines the null plane explained above, can be e.g. the rear of a transparent<br>
disc in a suction apparatus known as such, which is constructed (coated or uncoated)<br>
such that a small percentage of the incident radiation is reflected to obtain the image to be<br>
recorded by the camera 24.<br>
The following are used in particular as diffractive optical elements: gratings, Fresnel zone<br>
lenses, so-called beam-shaping elements etc. So-called refractive optical components can<br>
also be used as element (36): e.g. micro-lens arrays, beam-shaping elements etc. If the<br>
optical element 34 is used for amplitude analysis, then shadow masks or also arrangements<br>
of holes in any geometry such as square, hexangular, hexagonal etc. are particularly suitable,<br>
depending on the beam type and analysis aim.<br>
The optical element can also be formed as a slot or as an arrangement of several slots.<br>
Using the arrangements described, not only can the focal position be determined and controlled,<br>
but beam divergences, laser outputs, deviations of the radiation from the optical<br>
axis, deviations in the so-called beam product M2 or changes in the output beam profile of<br>
the light source 12 can also be detected, since all these beam parameters can have an influence<br>
on the reflected image recorded by the camera 24. With regard to all these beam<br>
parameters the computer C can be provided experimentally beforehand with a database<br>
through targeted trials, which database assigns deviations from the ideal target values, each<br>
of which correspond to image alterations, to individual beam parameters, so that the system<br>
is adjustable to ideal values by intervention with corresponding correcting variables.<br>
The use of diffractive optical elements here facilitates compensation of any phase alterations<br>
possibly occurring in the beam path that can also influence the focal position. The<br>
Hartmann Shack sensor, known as such, does not facilitate such an analysis.<br>
 <br>

focusing imaging system (16) in a focal plane (18) and wherein to determine the focal<br>
position of an optical system including the imaging system (16) by means of an optical<br>
element (34; 36) in the beam path an image is produced on the focus (18a), which is reflected<br>
there and is recorded by a camera (24), wherein said optical element (34; 36) influences<br>
the image recorded depending on the focusing of the radiation and wherein<br>
depending on said influencing of the image a conclusion is derived about the focal position<br>
of the focused radiation in relation to an envisaged focal point (18a), characterized in that<br>
by means of the optical element (34; 36) the phase or amplitude of the image is influenced<br>
depending on the focal position and that the optical system is a LASIK arrangement,<br>
wherein the partially reflective surface (18) reflects a small percentage of the incident<br>
radiation to obtain the image to be recorded using the digital sensor system.<br>
