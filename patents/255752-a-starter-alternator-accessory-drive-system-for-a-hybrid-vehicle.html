FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains generally to a starter alternator accessory drive<br>
system for a hybrid vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Driven accessories in a hybrid vehicle may include, for example, an air<br>
conditioning compressor, a power steering pump, and an alternator. These<br>
accessories are generally powered by output from the engine. Some of the<br>
accessories in a hybrid vehicle may require power while the engine is off and the<br>
vehicle is being powered by an electric motor/generator. Traditionally, in order to<br>
power hybrid vehicle accessories when the engine is off, it was necessary to<br>
provide each such accessory with a separate electric motor. It is also generally<br>
necessary to provide a device or system configured to restart the engine after it<br>
is turned off.<br>
Conventional automotive accessory drive systems include a drive pulley<br>
connected to an engine output shaft. A flexible chain or belt couples the drive<br>
pulley with a plurality of driven pulleys that are each operatively connected to an<br>
accessory. The operating speeds of the accessories in such a conventional drive<br>
system are directly proportional to the speed of the engine. Since the engine<br><br><br>
operates over a wide speed range (i.e., for example, between 500 rpm and<br>
8,000 rpm), the accessories are typically designed to provide full capacity at the<br>
low end of the engine speed range in order to ensure that they remain<br>
operational. Therefore, at higher engine speeds, excess energy transferred to the<br>
accessories may be lost.<br>
WO2005119023 (Al) describes a drive pulley for a cooling pump of an .engine<br>
comprising an input for connection to the engine and an output comprising a<br>
hollow cylindrical member , whose outer surface constitutes a pulley belt<br>
engagement surface. The input and output are connected by a transmission<br>
system comprising an epicyclic gearset including two or more first planet gears ,<br>
which are connected to respective planet shafts to rotate about the axis thereof<br>
and are in mesh with a first sun gear . The gearset comprises two or more<br>
second planet gears , which are connected to rotate with respective first planet<br>
gears and are in mesh with a second sun gear. The planet shafts are connected<br>
to a common carrier which constitutes the input. The first sun gear is<br>
connected to the output . The transmission system comprises, two electric<br>
motor/generators , the rotors of which are connected to the second sun gear<br>
and the output, respectively, and the electrical stator connections of which are<br>
connected to a controller arranged selectively to control the flow of electrical<br>
power between them. The transmission system is at least partially<br>
accommodated within the hollow cylindrical member.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention provides a starter alternator accessory drive<br>
system for a hybrid vehicle. The starter alternator accessory drive system includes a<br>
planetary gear set having a first, second, and third planetary member. An engine is<br>
operatively connected to the first planetary member, and a first motor/generator is<br>
operatively connected to the second planetary member. A torque transfer device<br>
operatively connects a plurality of accessories to the third planetary member. A<br>
second motor/generator is operatively connected to either the third planetary member<br>
or the torque transfer device. Engine output is transferable through the planetary<br>
gear set to drive the accessories at a selectable rate, and the first and second<br>
motor/generators are controllable to run the accessories while the engine is off and<br>
to re-start the engine.<br>
	According to the preferred embodiment, the first planetary member is a<br>
ring gear member, the second planetary member is a sun gear member, and the third<br>
planetary member is a planet carrier member.<br>

sun gear member, the second planetary member is a planet carrier member, and the<br>
third planetary member is a ring gear member.<br>
	According to another alternate embodiment, the first planetary member<br>
is a ring gear member, the second planetary member is a planet carrier member, and<br>

	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br><br><br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Conventional accessory drive systems operate by transferring engine<br>
output directly to the accessories so the accessories are driven at a speed directly<br>
proportional to engine speed. Since the engine operates over a wide speed range<br>
(e.g., between 500 rpm and 8,000 rpm), the accessories are typically designed to<br>
provide full capacity at the low end of the engine speed range in order to ensure<br>
they remain fully operational. Therefore, when the engine is operating at higher<br>
speeds, conventional accessory drive systems transfer more energy to the<br>
accessories than necessary to provide adequate function. The excess energy<br>
transferred to the accessories causes inefficiency and diminishes fuel economy. The<br>
starter alternator accessory drive (SAAD) system 10 (shown in Figure 1) of the<br>
present invention allows the accessories to be driven at a predetermined optimal<br>
speed independent from the speed at which the engine is running in order to<br>
improve fuel economy.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a schematic representation of a SAAD system 10<br>
for a hybrid vehicle is shown. The SAAD system 10 includes an engine 12<br>
configured to transmit output to a crank pulley 14 via a crankshaft or output shaft 16.<br>
A first belt or chain 18 couples the crank pulley 14 with an accessory drive input<br>
pulley 20. The accessory drive input pulley 20 is operatively connected to a<br>
differential transmission such as the planetary gear set 22. The planetary gear set 22<br>
has a plurality of members including: a sun gear 24; a plurality of pinions or planet<br>
gears 26; a ring gear 28; and a pinion carrier or planet carrier 30.<br>
	The engine 12 also transfers output via the crankshaft 16 to a<br>
transmission 17. The transmission 17 transfers output from the engine 12 to a<br>
plurality of wheels 19 in order to drive a hybrid vehicle. It should be appreciated that<br>
the transmission 17 and wheels 19 may include any known configurations and are not<br>
included as part of the SAAD system 10 of the present invention.<br><br><br>
	The planetary gear set 22 is configured to convert the rotational speed<br>
of the accessory drive input pulley 20 (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) to<br>
a predetermined value selected to efficiently drive the accessories 38. In other words,<br>
the planetary gear set 22 can selectively increase or decrease the magnitude of the<br>
rotational speed from the accessory drive input pulley 20 in order to drive the<br>
accessories 38 at more efficient speed and thereby improve fuel economy. Output<br>
from the planetary gear set 22 is transferred to an accessory drive output pulley 32. A<br>
second belt or chain 34 couples the accessory drive output pulley 32 with one or more<br>
accessory pulleys 36. The accessory pulleys 36 are each operatively connected to an<br>
accessory 38.<br>
	The SAAD system 10 includes a first motor/generator 40 and a second<br>
motor/generator 44. The first motor/generator 40 is configured to selectively transfer<br>
torque to and/or receive torque from the planetary gear set 22, either directly or<br>
through a transfer device such as, for example, a belt, chain, gear set, differential gear,<br>
etc. The first motor/generator 40 is configured to receive power from and/or transfer<br>
power to a storage device such as the battery 45. The second motor/generator 44 is<br>
configured to selectively transfer torque to and/or receive torque from the planetary<br>
gear set 22; the accessory drive output pulley 32; or one of the accessory pulleys 36,<br>
either directly or through a torque transfer device such as, for example, a belt; chain;<br>
gear set; differential gear; etc. The second motor/generator 44 is configured to<br>
receive power from and/or transfer power to a storage device such as the battery 45.<br>
The first and second motor/generators 40, 44 are configured to selectively operate as a<br>
motor, a generator, or they can be turned off to reduce rotational resistance.<br>
	The first and second motor/generators 40, 44 are controllable to drive<br>
the accessories 38 at a predetermined rate regardless of engine speed. As is known in<br>
the art, by transferring a first predetermined amount of input torque from the engine<br>
12 to one of the planetary gear set 22 members, and transferring a second<br>
predetermined amount of input torque from one of the motor/generators 40, 44 to<br>
another of the planetary gear set 22 members, the planetary gear set 22 can be<br>
controlled to produce a selectable amount of output torque from yet another of its<br>
members. Therefore, by controlling the status of the motor/generators 40, 44 (i.e.,<br>
either "motor", "generator", or "off), and the amount of output from the<br><br><br>
motor/generators 40, 44, the planetary gear set 22 output speed is selectable within an<br>
operational range.<br>
	The first and second motor/generators 40, 44 are controllable to drive<br>
the accessories 38 when the engine 12 is off. Therefore, the accessories 38 remain<br>
operational even when the hybrid vehicle is being powered exclusively by an<br>
alternate power source (not shown) in order to conserve fuel. When the engine 12<br>
is off, one of the motor/generators 40, 44 is preferably run as a motor, and the other<br>
of the motor/generators 40, 44 is preferably run as a generator; however alternate<br>
operational modes may be envisioned. Conventional hybrid vehicle accessory drive<br>
systems typically implement individual electric motors for each accessory in order to<br>
power the accessories when the engine is off. The SAAD system 10 of the present<br>
invention may reduce cost as compared to conventional systems by implementing<br>
fewer components (i.e., two motor/generators 40, 44) to drive all the accessories<br>
38.<br>
	The first and second motor/generators 40, 44 are also controllable to<br>
re-start the engine 12. Advantageously, the first and second motor/generators 40,<br>
44 can drive the accessories 38 when the engine 12 is being re-started such that<br>
there is no interruption of accessory 38 operation. More precisely, by controlling<br>
the first and second motor/generators 40, 44, output therefrom is transferable to the<br>
accessories 38 such that the accessories 38 remain powered, and to the engine 12<br>
such that the engine 12 is driven. As the engine 12 is being driven by the<br>
motor/generators 40, 44, a controller such as the controller 42 can introduce engine<br>
spark (not shown) to re-start the engine 12.<br>
The engine 12, the first motor/generator 40, and the second<br>
motor/generator 44 are operatively connected to a controller 42. The controller 42<br>
receives input from the engine 12 indicating the current engine speed and calculates<br>
corresponding speed and torque output values for the motor/generators 40, 44<br>
required to produce a predetermined planetary gear set 22 output speed. As an<br>
example, if the engine 12 is running at 4,000 rpm and the accessories 38 are<br>
optimized to run at 1,000 rpm, the controller 42 calculates the speed and amount of<br>
torque transfer from the motor/generators 40, 44 required to produce a planetary gear<br><br><br>
set 22 output speed of 1,000 rpm. These types of calculations are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art and therefore will not be described in detail hereinafter. After<br>
calculating, the controller 42 commands the desired operational status and torque<br>
outputs from the motor/generators 40, 44 such that the accessories 38 are driven in an<br>
optimally efficient manner.<br>
	Having explained the components and functionality of the SAAD<br>
system 10, the precise interconnection of these components will now be described in<br>
accordance with a plurality of different embodiments. Figures 2-11 each illustrate a<br>
separate embodiment that functions similarly to the previously described SAAD<br>
system 10, but includes somewhat different component connections. Like reference<br>
numbers are used in Figures 2-9 to refer to like components from Figure 1.<br>
Additionally, the letters "a" through "h" added as a suffix to a reference numeral<br>
identifies a similar component in a different embodiment. As an example, the engine<br>
12 of Figure 1 functions similarly to the engines 12a-12h of Figures 2-9,<br>
respectively. Therefore, unless specified otherwise, the components of Figures 2-9<br>
identified with a base reference number followed by one of the letters "a" through<br>
"h" should be considered to be identical to a respective component of Figure 1<br>
identified with a common base reference number.<br>
	Referring to Figure 2, a SAAD system 10a is shown in accordance<br>
with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The accessory drive input<br>
pulley 20a (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is operatively connected to the<br>
ring gear 28a of the planetary gear set 22a. The first motor/generator 40a is<br>
operatively connected to the sun gear 24a of the planetary gear set 22a. The second<br>
motor/generator 44a is operatively connected to the planet carrier 30a of the planetary<br>
gear set 22a. The planet carrier 30a of the planetary gear set 22a is also operatively<br>
connected to the accessory drive output pulley 32a. Therefore, in response to input<br>
from the engine 12a (via the ring gear 28a), the first motor/generator 40a (via the sun<br>
gear 24a) and/or the second motor/generator 44a (via the planet carrier 30a), the<br>
planetary gear set 22a can transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32a (via<br>
the planet carrier 30a) and thereby drive the accessories 38a at a selectable rate.<br>
When the engine 12a is off, the motor/generators 40a, 44a are controllable to transfer<br><br><br>
torque via the sun gear 24a and the planet carrier 30a, respectively, in order to power<br>
the accessories 38a and/or to re-start the engine 12a.<br>
	Referring to Figure 3, a SAAD system 10b is shown in accordance<br>
with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The accessory drive input<br>
pulley 20b (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is operatively connected to<br>
the sun gear 24b of the planetary gear set 22b. The first motor/generator 40b is<br>
operatively connected to the planet carrier 30b of the planetary gear set 22b. The<br>
second motor/generator 44b is operatively connected to the ring gear 28b. The ring<br>
gear 28b of the planetary gear set 22b is also operatively connected to the accessory<br>
drive output pulley 32b. Therefore, in response to input from the engine 12b (via the<br>
sun gear 24b), the first motor/generator 40b (via the planet carrier 30b) and/or the<br>
second motor/generator 44b (via the ring gear 28b), the planetary gear set 22b can<br>
transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32b (via the ring gear 28b) and<br>
thereby drive the accessories 38b at a selectable rate. When the engine 12b is off, the<br>
motor/generators 40b, 44b are controllable to transfer torque via the planet carrier 30b<br>
and the ring gear 28b, respectively, in order to power the accessories 38b and/or to re-<br>
start the engine 12b.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, a SAAD system 10c is shown in accordance<br>
with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The planetary gear set 22c of<br>
this embodiment preferably includes a double-pinion carrier 30c configuration. The<br>
accessory drive input pulley 20c (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is<br>
operatively connected to the ring gear 28c of the planetary gear set 22c. The first<br>
motor/generator 40c is operatively connected to the double-pinion carrier 30c of the<br>
planetary gear set 22c. The second motor/generator 44c is operatively connected to<br>
the sun gear 24c of the planetary gear set 22c. The sun gear 24c of the planetary gear<br>
set 22c is also operatively connected to the accessory drive output pulley 32c.<br>
Therefore, in response to input from the engine 12c (via the ring gear 28c), the first<br>
motor/generator 40c (via the double-pinion carrier 30c) and/or the second<br>
motor/generator 44c (via the sun gear 24c), the planetary gear set 22c can transfer<br>
output to the accessory drive output pulley 32c (via the sun gear 24c) and thereby<br>
drive the accessories 38c at a selectable rate. When the engine 12c is off, the<br>
motor/generators 40c, 44c are controllable to transfer torque via the double-pinion<br><br><br>
carrier 30c and the sun gear 24c, respectively, in order to power the accessories 38c<br>
and/or to re-start the engine 12c.<br>
	Referring to Figure 5, a SAAD system lOd is shown in accordance<br>
with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The accessory drive input<br>
pulley 20d (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is operatively connected to<br>
the planet carrier 30d of the planetary gear set 22d. The first motor/generator 40d is<br>
operatively connected to the ring gear 28d of the planetary gear set 22d. The second<br>
motor/generator 44d is operatively connected to an accessory pulley 36d. The sun<br>
gear 24d of the planetary gear set 22d is operatively connected to the accessory drive<br>
output pulley 32d. Therefore, in response to input from the engine 12d (via the planet<br>
carrier 30d), the first motor/generator 40d (via the ring gear 28d) and/or the second<br>
motor/generator 44d (via an accessory pulley 36d), the planetary gear set 22d can<br>
transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32d (via the sun gear 24d) and<br>
thereby drive the accessories 38d at a selectable rate. When the engine 12d is off, the<br>
motor/generators 40d, 44d are controllable to transfer torque via the ring gear 28d and<br>
an accessory pulley 36d, respectively, in order to power the accessories 38d and/or to<br>
re-start the engine 12d.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, a SAAD system lOe is shown in accordance<br>
with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. The accessory drive input<br>
pulley 20e (which runs at a fixed ratio of engine speed) is operatively connected to the<br>
planet carrier 30e of the planetary gear set 22e. The first motor/generator 40e is<br>
operatively connected to the sun gear 24e of the planetary gear set 22e. The second<br>
motor/generator 44e is operatively connected to the ring gear 28e of the planetary<br>
gear set 22e. The ring gear 28e of the planetary gear set 22e is also operatively<br>
connected to the accessory drive output pulley 32e. Therefore, in response to input<br>
from the engine 12e (via the planet carrier 30e), the first motor/generator 40e (via the<br>
sun gear 24e) and/or the second motor/generator 44e (via the ring gear 28e), the<br>
planetary gear set 22e can transfer output to the accessory drive output pulley 32e (via<br>
the ring gear 28e) and thereby drive the accessories 38e at a selectable rate. When the<br>
engine 12e is off, the motor/generators 40e, 44e are controllable to transfer torque via<br>
the sun gear 24e and the ring gear 28e, respectively, in order to power the accessories<br>
38e and/or to re-start the engine 12e.<br><br><br>
