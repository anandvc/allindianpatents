				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an isocyanate-reactive composition.<br>
This invention relates to rigid polyurethane or urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams, to processes for their preparation and to polyol blends for use in said processes.<br>
Rigid polyurethane and urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams are in general prepared by reacting a stoichiometric excess of polyisocyanate with isocyanate-reactive compounds in the presence of blowing agents, surfactants and catalysts. One use of such foams is as a thermal insulation medium in, for example, buildings.<br>
Polyether polyols or polyester polyols are generally used as isocyanate-reactive compounds.<br>
Polyester polyols impart excellent flame retardancy characteristics to the resulting polyurethane foams and are in some cases even less expensive than polyether polyols.<br>
There is a problem in respect of the stability of polyol blends containing polyester polyols and tertiary amine catalysts. It has been proposed to solve this problem by adding an organic carboxylic acid (such as formic acid, acetic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid) to the polyol' blend (see US-P-4,758,605). In order to retain the reactivity over prolonged storage catalyst levels need to be increased. Whereas the instability problem can be solved successfully in this way the processing of these systems is still uncontrollable which is reflected in the rise profile of the rising foam when the polyol blend is reacted with the polyisocyanate composition.<br>
Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide polyol blends containing polyester polyols and tertiary amine catalysts not showing the disadvantages mentioned above.<br>
According to the, present invention polyol blends are provided comprising a polyester polyol, a tertiary amine catalyst and an organic carboxylic acid wherein said carboxylic acid contains at least one OH, SH, NH, or NHR functional group, wherein R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group.<br>
The polyol blends of the present invention are stable for several weeks. Improved reaction profiles are obtained when these polyol blends are used to make rigid polyurethane foams; the cream time is decreased while at the same time the expansion of the foam at string time is almost complete.<br><br>
Carboxylic acids to be used in the present invention have the general formula X,, - R' - (COOH)m wherein X is OH, SH, NH, or NHR, R1 is an at least divalent hydrocarbon moiety, typically an at least divalent linear cr branched aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety and/or an at least divalent alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon moiety, n is an integer having a value of at least 1 and allows for mono and polyfunctional substitution on the hydrocarbon moiety, m is an integer having a value of at least 1 and allows for mono and polycarboxyl substitution on the hydrocarbon moiety.<br>
The "at least divalent hydrocarbon moiety" can be a saturated or unsaturated moiety of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, including a linear aliphatic moiety, a branched aliphatic moiety, an alicyclic moiety or an aromatic moiety. Stated otherwise, R' can, for example, be a linear or branched alkylene group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a cyclic alkylene group of 4 to 10 carbon atoms, or an arylene, an alkarylene or an ararylene group of 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Specific non-limiting examples of suitable hydrocarbon moieties are methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, isopropylene, n-butylene, isobutylene, n-amylene, n-decylene, 2-ethylhexylene, o-, m-, p-phenylene, ethyl-p-phenylene, 2,5-naphthylene, p,p'-biphenylene, cyclopentylene, cycloheptylene, xylylene, 1,4-dimethylenephenylene and the like. While above-noted radicals have two available substitution sites, at least one for a carboxyl group and one for a OH, SH, NH; or NHR group, it is contemplated that additional hydrogens on the hydrocarbon could be replaced with further carboxyl and/or OH, SH, NH:, or NHR groups.<br>
The carboxylic acids useful in the practice of the present invention generally have molecular weights below about 250.<br>
The following carboxylic acids are illustrative of compounds suitable for practicing the present invention: citric acid, dimethylolpropionic acid, bis-(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid, bishydroxypropionic acid, salicylic acid, n-hydroxy benzoic acid, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, dihydroxybenzoic acid, glycolic acid, p-hydroxybutyric acid, cresotic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, resorcylic acid, hydroferulic acid, glycine, alanine, mercaptoacetic acid and the like.<br>
Preferably X is OH, n is 1, R' is a linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon having 1 to 5 carbon atoms and m is 1, 2 or 3. Polycarboxylic acids are preferred. The hydroxyl group is preferably in a or P position with respect to the carboxyl group.<br>
Most preferred carboxylic acids are lactic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid and citric acid.<br>
At least one of said carboxylic acids is used; mixtures of two or more of these acids can be used as well.<br><br>
Particularly preferred carboxylic acids for use in the present invention are 'malic acid or a combination of malic acid and citric acid, preferably in a weight ratio of between 75:25 and 25:75, most preferably in a weight ratio of about 1:1. Further improvements in reaction profile are observed. The combination of malic acid and citric acid also leads to improvements in other physical properties of the obtained foam such as compression strength and adhesion;.also less variation in density distribution.<br>
The carboxylic acid is generally used in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 5 % by weight based on the isocyanate-reactive composition, preferably about 1 ' % to 3 %.<br>
iThe term "polyester polyol" as used herein is meant to include any polyester 'polyol having a hydroxyl functionality of at least two wherein the majority<br>
of the recurring units contain ester linkages and the molecular weight is<br>
at least 400.<br>
The polyester polyols for use in the present invention advantageously have an average functionality of about 1.8 to 8, preferably about 2 to 6 and more preferably about 2 to 2. 5.Their hydroxyl number values generally fall within a range of about 15 to 750,) preferably about 30 to 550, more preferably 70 to 550 and most preferab1y about 200 to 550 mg KOH/g. The molecular weight of the polyester polyol generally falls within the range of about 400 to about 10000, preferably about 1000 to about 6000. Preferably the polyester polyols have an acid number between 0.1 and 20 mg KOH/g; in general the acid number can be as high as 90 mg KOH/g.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the preparation of an isocyanate-reactive composition comprising the step of blending together at ambient temperature and pressure, at least 10% of a polyester polyol having an average functionality of 1.8 to 8, a hydroxyl number of 15 to 750 mg KOH/g and a molecular weight of 400 to 10000, 0.01 to 10% by weight of a tertiary amine catalyst selected from the group consisting of N-alkylmorpholine, N-alkylalkanolamine, N,N-dialkylcyclohexylamine, alkylamine, heterocyclic amine and 0.1 to 5% by weight of a carboxylic acid corresponding to the formula Xn-R'-(COOH)m wherein X is OH, SH, NH2 OR NHR, R' is a linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon or at least a divalent hydrocarbon moiety having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, n is an integer having a value of at least 1 and m is 1, 2 or 3.<br>
The polyester polyols of the present invention can be prepared by known procedures from a polycarboxylic acid or acid derivative, such as an anhydride or ester of the polycarboxylic acid, and may be polyhydric alcohol. The polyacid and/or polyol components may be used as mixtures of two or more compounds in the preparation of the polyester polyols.<br>
The polyols can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and/or heterocyclic-low molecular weight aliphatic polyhydric alcohols such as aliphatic dihydric alcohols having no more than about 20 carbon atoms are highly satisfactory. The polyols optionally may include substituents which are inert in the reaction, for example, chlorine and bromine substituents, and/or may be unsaturated. Suitable amino alcohols such as, for example, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, or the like may also be used. A preferred polyol compound is a glycol. The glycols may contain heteroatoms (e.g.) thiodiglycol) or may be composed solely of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They are advantageously simple glycols of the general formula CnH2n(OH)2 or polyglycols distinguished by intervening ether linkages<br><br>
in the hydrocarbon chain, as represented by the general formula C,,H;nOx(OH);. Examples of suitable polyhydric alcohols include: ethylene glycol, propylene glycol -(1,2) and -(1,3), butylene glycol -(1,4) and -(2,3), hexanediol -(1,6), cctanediol -(1,8), neopentyl glycol, 1,4-bishydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 2-methyl-l,3-propane diol, glycerin, trimethylolethane, hexanetriol -(1,2,6), butanetriol -(1,2,4), quinol, methyl glucoside, triethyleneglycol, tetraethylene glycol and higher polyethylene glycols, dipropylene glycol and higher polypropylene glycols, diethylene glycol, glycerol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, sorbitol, mannitol, dibutylene glycol and higher polybutylene glycols.

The polycarboxylic acid component may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and/or heterocyclic and may optionally be substituted, for example, by<br>
halogen atoms and/or may be unsaturated. Examples of suitable carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof for the preparation of the polyester polyols include: oxalic acid, malonic acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, phthalic acid anhydride, terephthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, trimellitic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride, hexahydrophthalic acid anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic acid anhydride, endomethylene tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, glutaric acid anhydride, maleic acid, maleic acid anhydride, terephthalic acid dimethylester, terephthalic acid-bis glycol ester, fumaric acid, dibasic and tribasic unsaturated fatty acids optionally mixed with monobasic unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acids.<br>
While the polyester pclyols can be prepared from substantially pure reactant materials, more complex ingredients can be used, such as the side-stream, waste or scrap residues from the manufacture of phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, dimethyl terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate, and the like. These compositions can be converted by reaction with polyols to polyester polyols through conventional transesterification or esterification procedures.<br>
The production of the polyester polyols is accomplished by simply reacting the polycarboxylic acid or acid derivative with the polyol component in a known manner until the hydroxyl and acid values of the reaction mixture fall in the desired range. After transesterification or esterification the reaction product can optionally be reacted with an alkylene oxide.<br><br>
The term "polyester polyol" as used herein includes any minor amounts of unreacted polyol remaining after the preparation of the polyester polyol and/or unesterified polyol (e.g., glycol) added after the preparation. The polyester polyol can advantageously include up to about 40% by weight free glycol. Preferably the free glycol content is from 2 to 30, more preferably from 2 to 15 % by weight of the total polyester polyol component.<br>
Aliphatic and/or aromatic polyester polyols can be used according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Mixtures of two or more different polyester polyols can be used.<br>
According to the present invention the polyester polyols described above can constitute the totality of the reactive mixture reacted with the polyisocyanate; it is understood, however, that these polyols could also be used mixed with other isocyanate-reactive compounds conventionally used in the art; preferably at least 10 %, more preferably at least 20 5 by weight of the total isocyanate-reactive compounds are polyester polyols as described above.<br>
The isocyanate-reactive compounds which can be employed in combination with the polyester polyols in the preparation of the rigid polyurethane foams of the present invention include any of those known in the art for that purpose.

The use of such additives is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Suitable organic polyisocyanates to be reacted with the polyol blends of the present invention to form rigid polyurethane or urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams include any of those known in the art for the preparation of rigid polyurethane or urethane-modified polyisocyanurate foams, and in particular the aromatic polyisocyanates such as diphenylmethane diisocyanate in the form of its 2,4'-, 2,2'- and 4,4'-isomers and mixtures thereof, the mixtures of diphenylmethane diisocyanates (MDI) and oligomers thereof known in the art as "crude" or polymeric MDI (polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanates) having an isocyanate functionality of greater than 2, toluene diisocyanate in the form of its 2,4- and 2,6-isomers and mixtures thereof, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate and 1,4-diisocyanatobenzene. Other organic polyisocyanates which may be mentioned include the aliphatic diisocyanates such as<br><br>
isophorone   diisocyanate,   1 , 6 -diisocyanatohexane   and<br>
4,4'-diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane. Further suitable polyisocyanates for<br>
use in the process of the present invention are those described in EP-A-<br>
0320134.<br>
Modified polyisocyanates, such as carbodiimide or uretonimine modified<br>
polyisocyanates can also be employed.<br>
Still  other useful  organic polyisocyanates  are isocyanate-terminated<br>
prepolymers prepared by reacting excess organic polyisocyanate with a minor<br>
amount of an active hydrogen-containing compound.<br>
Preferred polyisocyanates to be used in the present invention are the<br>
polymeric MDI's.<br>
The quantities of the polyisocyanate composition and the polyfunctional isocyanate-reactive composition to be reacted can be readily determined by the man skilled in the art. In general the NCO:OH ratio falls within the range 0.85 to 1.40, preferably about 0.95 to 1.20. Also higher NCO:OH ratios (for example, up to 3.0) fall within the present invention.<br>
In operating the process for making rigid foams according to the invention, the known one-shot, prepolymer or semi-prepolymer techniques may be used together with conventional mixing methods and the rigid foam may be produced in the form of slabstock, mouldings, cavity fillings, sprayed foam, frothed foam or laminates with other materials such as hardboard, plasterboard, plastics, paper or metal.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention the polyol blend as described above is reacted with a polyisocyanate composition to make rigid polyurethane foams.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention the ingredients (polyester polyol, amine catalyst and carboxylic acid) are not added as a blend but are added separately to the reaction mixture.<br>
The foams of the present invention are advantageously used for producing laminates whereby the foam is provided on one or both sides with a facing sheet. The laminates can be made in a continuous or discontinuous manner by depositing the foam forming mixture on a facing sheet and preferably placing another facing sheet on the deposited mixture. Any facing sheet previously employed to produce building panels can be employed and can be of a rigid or flexible nature.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a<br>
polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table<br>
1 at an NCO index of 1.15.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for<br>
the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the<br>
reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked<br>
mass).  The height of expansion was measured at the string time and also at<br>
the end of rise of the foam; from those two figures the expansion factor at<br>
string time (height at string/height at end of rise) was determined.<br>
The results are also given in Table 1.<br>
The rise profile was also followed by Dynamic Flow Data analysis.  Results<br>
are presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3 expressing the height of the rising foam<br>
versus the reaction time.<br>
These results show that whereas acetic acid leads to delayed action<br>
catalysis (Foam No. 2) addition of functionalised carboxylic acids of the<br>
present invention improves the reaction profile (Foam No. 3) (see Figure 1).<br>
Addition of selected classes of catalysts (for example, DMDEE, DMAP, NMI,<br>
Texacat DP914)  (Foams No. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9) further improves the reaction<br>
profile (see Figure 2) .<br>
Glycolic acid (Foam No. 9) performs better than lactic acid (Foam No. 4) in<br>
terms of reaction profile improvement (see Figure 3).<br><br>
Table  1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The stability of the polyol blend of Foam No. 1 and Foam No. 3 (as identified above in Table 1) was determined by measuring cream time, string time and density of the foam prepared initially and after storage of the polyol blend for 3 days, 1 week and 3 weeks, respectively, at 40°C. The results are presented in Table 2 for Foam No. 1 and in Table 3 for Foam No. 3.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 3<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
These results show chat whereas there are relatively large variations in cream time, string time and density for Foam No. 1, these differences are only marginal for Foam No. 3. Thus stability of the polyol blends containing the functionalised carboxylic acids of the present invention is improved compared to polyol blends not containing said acids.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table 4 at an NCO index of 1.15.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the<br><br>
reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked mass).  The height of expansion was measured at the string time and also at the end of rise of the foam; from those two figures the expansion factor at string time (height at string/height at end of rise) was determined. The results are also given in Table 4.<br>
It is to be noted that using citric acid or malic acid leads to the lowest density foam.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table 5 at an NCO index of 1.15.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked mass) . The height of expansion was measured at the string time and also at the end of rise of the foam; from those two figures the expansion factor at string time (height at string/height at end of rise) was determined. The results are also given in Table 5.<br>
The rise profile was also followed by Dynamic Flow Data analysis. Results are presented in Figure 4 expressing the height of the rising foam versus the reaction time for Foams Nos 18, 19 and 20.<br>
These results show that further improvements in reaction profile are obtained when malic acid (Foam No. 19) or a combination of malic acid and citric acid (Foam No. 20) are used instead of lactic acid (Foam No. 18).<br><br>

time and density of the foam prepared initially and after storage	of the<br>
polyol blend for 1 day,  4 days,  1 week and 2,  3,  4 and 5	weeks,<br>
respectively, at 40°C.<br>

EXAMPLE 6<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams were made from a polyol composition and a polyisocyanate composition containing the ingredients listed below in Table 8 at an NCO index of 1.<br>
The reaction profile was followed in respect of cream time (time taken for the reaction mixture to start foaming) and string time (time taken for the reaction mixture to reach the transition point from fluid to cross-linked mass).  Free rise density was also determined. The results are also given in Table 8.<br><br>
