				<td>This invention relates to a process of manufacturing dials having personal touch for watches.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Conventional dial making techniques are aimed at mass production of quality dials. These techniques are good when large quantities of the same dial are required. Different types of dials are:<br>
Printed dials: In these the basic dial blank (which is made of brass or plastic) is painted or plated on and different colours and finishes can be applied. After this the printing, is done on the dial using pad printing or screen-printing. In both these printing techniques each colour has to be applied with the help of a specially prepared mask (screen printing) or etched plate (pad printing). More the colors, more the masks/etched plates are required. This results in a basic minimum costing which if put on a single dial will result in a very expensive dial. For example, a mask for silk screen printing will cost at least about Rs 100 and a pad printing plate will cost even more.<br>
Photo dials are also made where photographs are put on the dial face. This process too is possible only for large runs of dials since the startup costs are high and runs into thousands of rupees.<br>
The object of this invention is to manufacture dials with a personal touch even one or more dials at a cheaper price.<br>
To achieve the said objective, this invention provides a process of manufacturing dials with a personal touch for watches comprising:<br>
making the desired artwork / photograph in the computer in any graphic package,<br>
transferring the  said  artwork  image on a  plastic  substrate  by thermal transfer means,<br>
outlining the dial on the said plastic substrate and cutting the same in conformity with the brass dial blank,<br>
applying soapy water on the said cut dial from the plastic substrate and applying the said cut dial on the said dial blank.<br>
2<br><br>
pressing the said cut dial on the said dial blank for sticking on to the said dial blank by a rubber Dress means till the air and water between the sticker and the dial blank are removed and the sticker and the dial blank are firmly joined to each other,<br>
cleaning the dial so prepared to remove any traces for soap stains, and<br>
the dial so prepared is then fitted on to the watch movement as any conventional dial and the watch is thereby assembled.<br>
In this process, it is possible to print and cut dials of different designs at the same time. Since the computer and thermal transfer means is used, it is possible to make different dials side by side to give personal touch. The different dials are organized on the computer screen and then printed and cut in one go. Hence customization is easily possible.<br>
The graphical packages used are Coreldraw and Adobe Illustrator and the thermal means is a 4-color thermal transfer print and cut machine and the artwork / photograph is made in the computer by any known means, like scanner or they may be taken from the internet or the hard disk.<br>
The soapy water used is 1% soapy water solution. The cut dial has a hole in the centre, such that when applied with soapy water and put on the blank dial, it slips on the blank dial and fits on a hole at the centre of the blank dial.<br>
The rubber press means are conical rubber pieces concentric with the dial such that when pressure is applied on the said rubber pieces, the central portion of the rubber touches the centre of the sticker progressively till the air and water between the sticker and the dial blank are removed and the sticker and the dial blank are firmly joined to each other.<br>
The above process steps will now be illustrated by a flow diagram shown in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the photograph / printed matter to be included in the dial. Fig. 2 shows the photograph scanned on the computer by the scanner. Fig. 3 shows dial designing<br>
Fig. 4 shows, dial printing and cutting by 4-color thermal transfer print and cut machine .<br>

Fig. 5 shows removing sticker from the plastic substrate.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the plastic substrate with removed sticker.<br>
Fig. 7 shows that the sticker dipped in soapy water<br>
Fig. 8 shows the dial blank<br>
Fig. 9 shows the dial blank ready for sticker pasting<br>
Fig. 10 shows the sticker placed on the dial blank under the press<br>
Fig. 11 shows the ready dial<br>
Fig. 12 shows the dial and watch movement<br>
Fig. 13 shows the watch movement with dial and hands<br>
Fig. 14 shows the ready watch.<br>
Referring to the drawings, photograph (1) is scanned on the computer as shown in figure (2) and is then transferred on the plastic substrate by thermal transfer means. The dial is designed and printed with the said photograph and cut as shown in figures (3 &amp; 4). The sticker is removed from the cut dial, as shown in figures (5 &amp; 6). The said sticker with cut dial dipped in soap water and has a hole, which coincides with the hole in the dial blank. The cut dial slips over the dial blank and is pressed with a rubber press till the water and air are removed and the sticker sticks to the dial blank as shown in figure (9 &amp; 10). Thereafter the dial is ready and is fixed on the watch movement with hands as shown in figures (11 to 13) and the watch is ready as shown in figure (14).<br>

I claim:<br>
1.	A process of manufacturing dials having personal touch for watches<br>
comprising:<br>
making the desired artwork / photograph in the computer in any graphic package,<br>
transferring the said artwork image on a plastic substrate by thermal transfer means;<br>

cleaning the dial so prepared to remove any traces for soap stains, and<br>
the dial so prepared is then fitted on to the watch movement as any conventional dial and the watch is thereby assembled.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the graphical packages used are<br>
Coreldraw and Adobe Illustrator.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the thermal transfer means is a<br>
4-color thermal transfer print and cut machine.<br>

5.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the soapy water used is 1%<br>
soapy water solution.<br>
5<br><br>
6.      A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the cut dial has a hole in the       centre, such that when applied with soapy water and put on the blank dial, it slips on the blank dial and fits on a hole at the centre of the blank dial.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the rubber press means are<br>
