				<td>This invention relates to an aqueous ink jet composition and to a method of preparing the same and to a method of preparing an ink jet print. The said composition contains carbon products as pigments.<br>
Ink jet printing is a non-impact process wherein droplets of ink are produced and deposited on a substrate such as paper, transparent film, or textile material in response to an electronic signal. Typical ink jet printing systems are continuous stream or drop-on-demand type. In continuous Inkjet systems, ink is emitted in a continuous stream under pressure through at least one orifice or nozzle. The stream is perturbed causing it to break up into droplets at a fixed distance from the orifice. At the breakup point, the droplets are charged in accordance with digital data signals and passed through an electrostatic field. The field adjusts the trajectory of each droplet to direct it to a gutter for recirculation or to a specific location on a recording medium to create images. In drop-on-demand systems, a droplet is expelled from an orifice directly to a position on a recording medium by pressure—<br><br><br>
not formed or expelled unless it is to be placed on the recording medium.  The drop-on-demand, system has several advantages over the continuous system in that it requires no ink recovery, charging, or deflection.<br>
There are three basic types of drop-on-demand ink jet systems.  One type has an ink filled channel with a nozzle on one end and a piezoelectric transducer near the other end which produces pressure pulses.  The relatively large size of the transducer prevents close spacing of the nozzles, which may limit print quality. Physical limitations of the transducer result in low ink drop velocity and slow printing speed.  The low drop velocity may also diminish tolerances for drop velocity variation and directionality.<br>
A second type of drop-on-demand system is known as a therm'al ink jet or bubble jet printer.  The major components are an ink-filled channel with a nozzle at one end and a heat generating resistor near the nozzle.  Printing signals create an electric current pulse in a resistive layer within each ink passageway, causing the ink in the immediate vicinity to evaporate, creating a bubble.  Some of the ink in the channel is forced out through the orifice as a propelled droplet due to bubble expansion. Thermal or bubble ink jet printers produce high velocity droplets and allow very close spacing of nozzles, which results in a high quality of print.<br>
The third type of drop-on-demand ink jet device is known as an acoustic ink printer.  This printer utilizes a focused acoustic beam formed with a spherical lens illuminated by a plane<br><br>
wave of sound created by a piezoelectric transducer.  The focused acoustic beam exerts pressure on the surface of the liquid, resulting in the ejection of small droplets of ink onto an imaging substrate.<br>
Conventional inks for ink jet printers generally comprise a colorant such as dye which is soluble in a vehicle of water or a mixture comprising water and a water-soluble or water-miscible organic solvent.  However, dyes have several disadvantages when used in ink jet inks.  Dyes, being water-soluble or soluble in a water and organic mixture, may redissolve and run when exposed to moisture or water.  Dye images may smear and rub off on contact with felt pen markers or upon being rubbed with a finger.  Dyes also exhibit poor light stability, including fluorescence, sunlight, and ultraviolet light.  Inks comprising soluble dyes may also exhibit clogging of the jetting channels due to solvent evaporation and changes in the dye's solubility, dye crystallization, and the presence of impurities.  Dye-based ink may also exhibit poor thermal and chemical stability which could result in poor print quality.  The dye may also bleed or diffuse into pores of the paper, thus causing poor print quality and low optical density of the image.  Specialty paper may be necessary for certain ink jet inks containing a dye.  In addition, many of the dyes contained in inks may be potentially mutagenic.<br>
Pigments have also been used as colorants in ink jet inks, either as substitutes for, or in combination with, dyes. Pigments offer properties superior to dyes in areas such as waterfastness, lightfastness, image density, thermal stability oxidative and chemical stability, compatibility with other<br><br>
colorants, and compatibility with both coated/treated and plain papers.  Additionally, pigments are generally nonmutagenic. Pigments used in ink jet inks include carbon black, titanium dioxide white, cobalt blue (C0O-AI2O3), and chrome yellow (PbCr04).  Carbon black, which absorbs in the infrared region, may be used for bar code reading.<br>
The major problem with the use of such pigments is dispersion.  Pigment particles such as carbon black generally start in a clumped or agglomerated state.  To prepare ink jet inks, however, the carbon black must be dispersed and stabilized in that form because the extent of dispersion directly affects ink jet printing characteristics such as ejectability, print quality, optical density, and the like.  Additionally, since the lozzle openings of thermal or bubble type ink jet printers are :ypically about 40-60 micrometers in diameter, it is critical to ensure that the ink jet ink does not clog or plug these openings. ?hus, it is necessary to make the pigment particles as small as possible.  Preferably carbon black is reduced to individual iggregates.  Small pigment particles are also less prone to settling during storage and therefore further contribute to the stability of the carbon black dispersion.<br>
In light of these requirements, conventional aqueous )igment-based ink jet inks generally contain an aqueous ink vehicle, a pigment, a dispersant, and a humectant to prevent Irying of ink or the clogging of orifices.  Further additives !uch as biocides, binders, salts, driers, penetrants, surfactants, and the like may also be included.<br><br>
Dispersants are materials that can bind to the pigment with one part of a molecule, while the other is attracted to the vehicle.  A dispersant typically coats the pigment particles and then attracts a coating of the vehicle, which allows the coated particles to disperse in the vehicle.  Clumping and agglomeration of the pigment particles are therefore minimized due to a steric or electro-steric repulsion caused by the protective coverage.<br>
The conventional steps for preparing a pigment-based ink jet ink, as well known in the art, are as follows:  First, the pigment must be milled to a small size in the presence of the solvent and the dispersant,' by any of a variety of mechanical dispersion processes, including a liquid jet interaction chamber, a media mill, a ball mill, a roll-mill, a speed line mill, a homogenizer, and a sand grinder.  Without the milling step, the dispersant will be ineffective.  The pigment dispersion may be diluted further with the vehicle to obtain a desired concentration.  Finally, some additional ink components, such as hiimectant, viscosity control additive, biocide, fungicide, pH adjuster, anti-corrosion agent, and the like, may be added to the pigment dispersion.  Further dilution with the vehicle may also be made.  It may also be necessary to remove larger particles by filtration and/or centrifuga'tion.<br>
For general discussion on the properties, preparation, and uses of aqueous inks, see The Printing Manual,   5th Ed., Leach et al., Eds. (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1993).<br>
The majority of time and cost is therefore spent on adequately dispersing the pigment in the aqueous medium.  The<br><br>
  pigments is reflected in the patents discussed below.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,184,148 discloses an ink jet ink comprising an aqueous liquid medium containing acid carbon black and a water-soluble resin having a weight average molecular weight within the range of 3,000 to 30,000.  The resin acts to improve the dispersion stability of the carbon black in the liquid medium.  Other additives such as surfactants, defearning agents, preservatives, dyes, and the like, may also be included.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,597,794 discloses an ink jet recording process which uses an ink prepared by dispersing fine particles of a pigment into an aqueous dispersion vehicle containing a polymer having both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic construction portion.  The hydrophilic portion constitutes a polymer of monomers having mainly polymerizable vinyl groups into which hydrophilic portions such as carboxylic acid groups, sulfonic acid groups, and sulfate groups have been included.  Examples of the monomers to which hydrophilic groups are attached include styrene and its derivatives, vinylnaphthalene and its derivatives, and a,p-ethylenic unsaturated carboxylate of a Cg-C]_g aliphatic alcohol.  The hydrophobic portion of the polymer adsorbs to the pigment and the hydrophilic portion faces out from the pigment to bond with water or another aqueous solvent.  This mechanism produces improved dispersion of the pigment.  The ink compositions disclosed may also include additives such as surfactants, salts, resins, and dyes.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,530,961 discloses an aqueous dispersion of carbon black grafted with hydrophilic monomers of alkali or<br><br>
ammonium carboxylate bearing polyacrylates, which may be used for manufacturing ink jet inks.  The carbon black is treated in water with a water-soluble peroxide, and after peroxidation, a water-soluble acrylic monomer and more peroxide are added.  This process results in simultaneous homogeneous free radical polymerization of the monomer and grafting onto the carbon black. This composition may also contain surfactants, wetting agents, dyes, or other additives.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,281,261 discloses an ink containing carbon black particles having a polymeric vinyl aromatic salt either chemically grafted or adsorbed onto their surfaces.  The salt may simply be adsorbed to the surface of the carbon black due to similar hydrophobicity of the carbon black and the aromatic groups of the salt.  If the salt is grafted to the carbon black, it is not the aromatic portion of the salt which is directly grafted to the carbon black.  Instead, a polymerizable olefinic group on the salt interacts with the carbon black to graft the salt thereon.  Additionally, as with typical ink jet inks, additives such as surfactants, wetting agents, dyes, and the like, may be present.<br>
The above U.S. Patents and article are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
While the use of pigments such as carbon black in ink jeL inks represents an alternative to dyes, there remains a need for a pigment that can be stably dispersed in its smallest particulate form without undue processing and cost.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an aqueous ink jet ink composition comprising an aqueous vehicle and a modified carbon product containing carbon having attached at least one organic group.  Carbon, as used herein, is capable of reacting with a diazonium salt to form the above-mentioned modified carbon product.  The carbon may be of the crystalline or amorphous type. Examples include, but are not limited tOy graphite, carbon black, vitreous carbon, activated charcoal, activated carbon, and mixtures thereof.  Finely divided forms of the above are preferred.  The organic group comprises a) at least one aromatic group and b) at least one ionic group, at least one ionizable group, or a mixture of an ionic group and an ionizable group. The organic group having an aromatic group is directly attached to the carbon by the aromatic group.<br>
The present invention also relates to an aqueous ink jet ink composition comprising an aqueous vehicle and the above-described modified carbon product.  The organic group of the modified carbon product comprises a) at least one C-j_-C-j_2 alkyl group and b) at least one ionic group, at least one ionizable group, or a mixture of an ionic group and an ionizable group.  The ink jet inks of this invention offer desirable dispersion stability, jetability, print quality, and image optical density.  The present invention additionally relates to an ink jet recording method having the step of applying to a recording medium ink droplets from orifices of an ink jet recording head, wherein the ink jet ink of the present invention is utilized.<br><br>
'he present invention further relates to a method to increase optical density of an aqueous ink jet ink which includes the step of adding or incorporating the modified carbon product of the present invention into the aqueous ink jet ink.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention relates to an aqueous ink jet ink composition comprising an aqueous vehicle and a modified carbon product.  In contrast to conventional carbon pigments, the modified carbon products for use in the ink jet ink of the present invention are not difficult to disperse in an aqueous vehicle.  The modified carbon products do not necessarily require a conventional milling process, nor are dispersants necessarily needed to attain a usable ink.  Preferably, the modified carbon products only require low shear stirring or mixing to readily disperse the pigment in water.<br>
Carbon, as used herein, is capable of reacting with a diazonium salt to form the above-mentioned modified carbon product.  The carbon may be of the crystalline or amorphous type. Examples include, but are not limited to, graphite, carbon black, vitreous carbon, activated charcoal, and activated carbon. Finely divided forms of the above are preferred; also, it is possible to utilize mixtures of different carbon".  The carbon products may be prepared by reacting carbon as defined above, with a diazonium salt in a liquid reaction medium to attach at least one organic group to the surface of the carbon.  Preferred reaction media include water, any medium containing water, and any medium containing alcohol. Water is the most preferred<br><br>
medium.  These modified carbon products, wherein the carbon is carbon black, and various methods for their preparation are described in U.S. patent application 08/356,660 entitled "Reaction of Carbon Black with Diazonium Salts, Resultant Carbon Black Products and Their Uses," filed December 15, 1994, and its continuation-in-part application, filed concurrently with this application, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. These modified carbon products, wherein the carbon is not carbon black, and various methods for their preparation are described in patent application serial number 08/356,653 entitled "Reaction of Carbon Materials with Diazonium Salts and Resultant Carbon Products" filed December 15, 1994, also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
To prepare the above modified carbon products, the diazonium salt need only be sufficiently stable to allow'reaction with the carbon.  Thus, that reaction can be carried out with some diazonium salts otherwise considered to be unstable and subject to decomposition.  Some decomposition processes may compete with the reaction between the carbon and the diazonium salt and may reduce the total number of organic groups attached to the carbon. Further, the reaction may be carried out at elevated temperatures where many diazonium salts may be susceptible to decomposition. Elevated temperatures may also advantageously increase the solubility of the diazonium salt in the reaction medium and improve its handling during the process.  However, elevated temperatures may result in some loss of the diazonium salt due to other decomposition processes.<br><br>
Carijon JDiack can be reacted with a diazonium salt when present as a dilute, easily stirred, aqueous slurry, or in the presence of the proper amount of water for carbon black pellet formation.  If desired, carbon black pellets may be formed utilizing a conventional pelletizing technology.  Other carbons can be similarly reacted with the diazonium salt.  In addition, when modified carbon products utilizing carbon other than carbon black are used in ink jet inks, the carbon should preferably be ground to a fine particle size before reaction with the diazonium salt to prevent unwanted precipitation in the ink.  A preferred set of organic groups which may be attached to the carbon are organic groups substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group as a functional group.  An ionizable group is one which is capable of forming an ionic group in the medium of use.  The ionic group may be an anionic group or a cationic group and the ionizable group may form an anion or a cation.<br>
Ionizable functional groups forming anions include, for example, acidic groups or salts of acidic groups.  The organic groups, therefore, include groups derived from organic acids. Preferably, when it contains an ionizable group forming an anion, such an organic group has a) an aromatic group or a C-]_-C]_2 alkyl group and b) at least one acidic group having a pKa of less than 11, or at least one salt of an acidic group having a pKa of less than 11, or a mixture of at least one acidic group having a pKa of less than 11 and at least one salt of an acidic group having a pKa of less than 11.  The pKa of the acidic group refers to the pKa of the organic group as a whole, not just the acidic substituent.  More preferably, the pKa is less than 10 and most.<br><br>
referably less than 9.  Preferably, the aromatic group or the Ikyl group of the organic group is directly attached to the arbon.  The aromatic group may be further substituted or ^substituted, for example, with alkyl groups.  The C-L-C-J_2 alkyl roup may be branched or unbranched and is preferably ethyl. Dre preferably, the organic group is a phenyl or a naphthyl roup and the acidic group is a sulfonic acid group, a sulfinic rid group, a phosphonic acid group, or a carboxylic acid group, camples include -COOH, -SO3H and -PO3H2, -SO2NH2, -SO2NHCOR, and leir salts, for example -COONa, -COOK, -COO'NR^"^, -S03Na, iP03Na, -S03"NR4'^, and P03,Na2, where R is an alkyl or phenyl roup.  Particularly preferred ionizable substituents are -COOH id -SO3H and their sodium and potassium salts.<br>
Most preferably, the organic group is a substituted or isubstituted sulfophenyl group or a salt thereof; a substituted : unsubstituted (polysulfo)phenyl group or a salt thereof; a ibstituted or unsubstituted sulfonaphthyl group or a salt lereof; or a substituted or unsubstituted (polysulfo)naphthyl ■oup or a salt thereof.  A preferred substituted sulfophenyl ■oup is hydroxysulfophenyl group or a salt thereof.<br>
Specific organic groups having an ionizable functional group )rming an anion are p-sulfophenyl, 4-hydroxy-3-sulfophenyl, and ■sulfoethyl.<br>
Amines represent examples of ionizable functional groups that )rm cationic groups and can be attached to the same organic ■oups as discussed above for the ionizable groups which form lions.  For example, amines may be protonated to form ammonium ■oups in acidic media.  Preferably, an organic group having an<br><br>
amine substituent has a pKb of less than 5.  Quaternary ammonium groups (-NR3'^) and quaternary phosphonium groups (-PR3"^) also represent examples of cationic groups and can be attached to the same organic groups as discussed above for the ionizable groups which form anions.  Preferably, the organic group contains an aromatic group such as a phenyl or a naphthyl group and a quaternary ammonium or a quaternary phosphonium group.  The aromatic group is preferably directly attached to the carbon. Quaternized cyclic amines, and quaternized aromatic amines, can also be used as the organic group.  Thus, N-substituted pyridinium compounds, such as N-methyl-pyridyl, can be used in this regard. Examples of organic groups include, but are not limited to, 3-C5H4N(C2H5)^, C5H4NC5H5^, C5H4COCH2N(CH3)3+, C5H4COCH2(NC5H5)^, 3-C5H4N(CH3)+, and CgH4CH2N(CH3)3^.<br>
An advantage of the modified carbon products having an attached organic group substituted with an ionic or an ionizable group is that the modified carbon products may have increased water dispersibility relative to the corresponding untreated carbon.  In general, water dispersibility of the modified carbon products increases with the number of organic groups attached to the carbon having an ionizable group or the number of ionizable groups attached to a given organic group.  Thus, increasing the number of ionizable groups associated with the modified carbon products should increase their water dispersibility and permits control of the water dispersibility to a desired level.  It can be noted that the water dispersibility of modified carbon products containing an amine as the organic group attached to the carbon may be increased by acidifying the aqueous vehicle.<br><br>
Because the water dispersibility of the modified carbon products depends to some extent on charge stabilization, it is preferable that the ionic strength of the aqueous medium be less than 0.1 molar.  More preferably, the ionic strength is less than 0.01 molar.  It is preferred that the modified carbon product of the present invention contain no by-products or salts.<br>
When water dispersible modified carbon products of the present invention are prepared, it is preferred that the ionic or ionizable groups be ionized in the reaction medium.  The resulting product dispersion or slurry may be used as is or diluted prior to use.  Alternatively, the modified carbon products may be dried by techniques used for conventional carbon blacks.  These techniques include, but are not limited to, drying in ovens and "rotary kilns.  Overdrying, however, may cause a loss in the degree of water dispersibility.  In the event that the modified carbon products above do not disperse in the aqueous vehicle as readily as desired, the modified carbon products may be dispersed using conventionally known techniques such as milling or grinding.<br>
Formation of an ink jet ink containing an aqueous vehicle and stably dispersed modified carbon product as pigment can be performed with a minimum of components and processing steps when the above carbon products are utilized.  Such an ink may be used in any ink jet printer known in the art.  Preferably, in ink jet inks of the present invention, the carbon products are present in an amount of less than or equal to 20% by weight of the ink jet ink.  It is also within the bounds of the present invention to use an ink jet ink formulation containing a mixture of unmodified<br><br>
cariDon with the modified carbon products of the present invention.  Common additives such as those discussed below may be added to the dispersion to further improve the properties of the ink jet ink.<br>
In particular, a humectant may be added to reduce the rate of evaporation of water in the ink to minimize clogging.  If the ink begins to dry out, the humectant concentration increases.and evaporation decreases further.  Humectants may also affect other properties of the ink and prints made therefrom, such as viscosity, pH, surface tension, optical density, and print quality.  Preferred humectants include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycols, glycerine, dipropylene glycols, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, ethers, carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, organosulfides, organosulfoxides, sulfones, alcohol derivatives, carbitol, butyl carbitol, cellosolve, ether derivatives, amino alcohols, and ketones.<br>
Biocides such as benzoate or sorbate salts are important in preventing bacterial growth.  Bacteria are often larger than ink nozzles and can cause clogging and other problems.  Binders attach to the substrate to hold the colorant on the paper. Examples include polyester, polyester-melanine, styrene-acrylic acid copolymers, styrene-acrylic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymers, styrene-maleic acid copolymers, styrene-maleic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymers, styrene-methacrylic acid copolymers, styrene-methacrylic acid-alkyl acrylate copolymers, styrene-maleic half ester copolymers, vinyl naphthalene-acrylic acid copolymers, vinyl naphthalene-maleic acid copolymers, and<br><br>
salts thereof.  Drying accelerating agents promote evaporation of the ink once the ink is placed on the paper.  These include sodium lauryl sulfate, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide,<br>
cyclohexylpyrrolidinone, and butyl carbitol.  Penetrants such as alcohols, sodium lauryl sulfate, esters, and ketones allow the ink to penetrate the surface of the paper.  Alcohols may also be used to increase the rate of drying of the liquid ink.  And surfactants like detergents and soap reduce the surface tension to allow the ink to spread on the substrate.<br>
Additionally, the modified carbon products-based ink jet inks may incorporate some dye to modify color balance and adjust optical density.  Such dyes include food dyes, FD &amp; C dyes, derivatives of phathalocyanine tetrasulfonic acids, including copper phthalocyanine derivatives, tetra sodium salts, tetra ammonium salts, tetra potassium salts, tetra lithium salts, and the like.<br>
Polymers or oligomers may be added to ink jet inks based on the modified carbon products.  The images created from such an ink may be water-insoluble upon polymerization or cross-linking of the added polymers or oligomers.<br>
Additionally, in preparing ink jet inks utilizing the modified carbon product of the present invention, sequential filtration of the inks through filters of descending size may be used to obtain a more desirable final product.  For instance, filtering first with a 3.0 micron filter and then filtering with a 1.0 micron filter, and so on, as desired.  In addition, the size of the modified carbon product in the ink jet inks is<br><br>
preferably no larger than about 2 microns.  More preferably, the size of the modified carbon product is one micron or less.    ■ '<br>
Advantageously, the ink jet inks of the invention have excellent stability over time and a wide range of temperatures, have desirable viscosities and surface tensions, and when printed, have good optical density, print clarity, rub resistance, and waterfastness.  Particularly good waterfastness can be obtained when the ink jet ink contains certain stryenated acrylics that impart this property.  For instance, one such stryenated acrylic has a molecular weight of about 42 00, a polydispersibility of about 2, and acid number of about 215, a softening point of about 12 8°C, and a T  of about 67°C.  A commerically available example is JONCRYL 5 8 acrylic (JONCRYL is a registered trademark of Johnson Polymer, Racine WI.), which is a solution of Joncryl 680.<br>
With the use of the modified carbon products of the present invention in ink jet ink formulations, a high surface tension of greater than 70 dynes/cm, and a low viscosity of less than 1.9 cP, can be achieved.  The surface tension may be lowered, if desired, by the addition of the other ingredients.  This flexibility in formulation allows the control of the drop size and uniformity.  As reflected in more detail in the Examples below,, excellent optical density using the ink jet ink formulations of the present invention was achieved.<br>
