				<td>PATCHOULOL ODORANT<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns some perhydro naphthalenol derivatives of formula (I) which are useful as<br>
woody-earthy odorants. The present invention concerns the use of said compounds in the<br>
perfumery industry as well as the compositions or articles containing said compounds.<br>
Prior art<br>
To the best of our knowledge, the invention's compounds are new, and have no<br>
close structural analogues which are known as perfuming ingredients.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered that a compound of formula<br>
<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a formyl or acetyl group;<br>
R2 represents a methyl or ethyl group; and<br>
each R represents, independendy from each other, a hydrogen atom or a methyl group,<br>
and at least two of said R are methyl groups;<br>
can be used as perfuming ingredient, for instance to impart odor notes of the woody-<br>
earthy type.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, said compound (I) is one wherein<br>
R1 is a hydrogen atom.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, said compound (I) is one wherein<br>
R2 is a methyl group.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, said compound (I) is of formula<br>
<br>
wherein two R represent hydrogen atoms and the two other R represent methyl groups.<br>
As typical examples of the invention's compounds, one may cite perhydro-6,8,8a-<br>
trimethyl-1-naphthalenol. Said compound possesses a woody-earthy odor, combined with<br>
an interesting herbaceous-eucalyptus bottom note. The woody note lacks any amber<br>
connotation, which is often present in woody odorant being naphthalene derivatives.<br>
Furthermore, the overall odor, and in particular the earthy note, is very close to the odor of<br>
the forest floor, and in fact reminds very strongly of the odor of pure patchoulol. From a<br>
perfumistic or odor point of view, perhydro-6,8,8a-trimethyl-l-naphthalenol represents<br>
the closest synthetic analogue of pure patchoulol.<br>
Furthermore the present compound distinguishes itself from the other perfuming<br>
ingredients having patchouli type note by lacking the phenolic, spicy notes so typical of<br>
patchouli oil.<br>
It is also interesting to point out that perhydro-6,8,8a-trimethyl-l-naphthalenol<br>
demonstrated in various detergent tests to be amongst the most substantive compounds of<br>
its odor family.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns the use of a compound of formula (I)<br>
as perfuming ingredient. In other words it concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve<br>
or modify the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a perfumed article, which<br>
method comprises adding to said composition or article an effective amount of at least a<br>
compound of formula (I). By "use of a compound of formula (I)" it has to be understood<br>
here also the use of any composition containing compound (I) and which can be<br>
advantageously employed in perfumery industry as active ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which in fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming<br>
ingredient, are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a<br>
perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of<br>
perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting example solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or<br>
polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials may comprise wall-<br>
forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides, natural or<br>
modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates,<br>
polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids : Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel,<br>
Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH<br>
&amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in<br>
the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying,<br>
agglomeration or yet extrusion ; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including<br>
coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.<br>
By "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising at least one<br>
perfuming co-ingredient.<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming<br>
co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound which is used in perfuming preparation or<br>
composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be<br>
considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition,<br>
and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpenoids, nitrogenous or sulphurous<br>
heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients can be of<br>
natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in reference<br>
texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair,<br>
New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar nature, as<br>
well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also understood that<br>
said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a controlled manner<br>
various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery carriers, than those previously specified, can be also<br>
ethanol, water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those<br>
known under the trademark Isopar (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol<br>
ether esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
By "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable of imparting<br>
additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance, chemical stability,<br>
etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant commonly used in<br>
perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that said ingredients are<br>
well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I)<br>
and at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as<br>
well as a perfuming composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), at least<br>
one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) is important as it enables the<br>
perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes, possessing the odor tonality of various compounds<br>
of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.<br>
Preferably, any mixture resulting direcdy from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without<br>
an adequate purification, in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a<br>
starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the<br>
fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product<br>
into which said compound (I) is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I), as defined above, or<br>
an invention's perfuming composition; and<br>
ii) a consumer product base ;<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base",<br>
we mean here a consumer product, which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In<br>
other words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least<br>
one invention's compound.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br>
Examples of suitable consumer product bases include solid or liquid detergents<br>
and fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely<br>
perfumes, colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses,<br>
oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products,<br>
deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents<br>
there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for<br>
washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface<br>
treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed<br>
articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
aggressive medium for the invention's compound, so that it may be necessary to protect<br>
the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed<br>
and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given<br>
base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-<br>
ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.01 % to 30 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br>
lower man these, such as in the order of 0.01% to 10% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles, percentage being relative to the<br>
weight of the article.<br>
The invention's compounds were prepared by reacting an adequate cyclohexenone<br>
with an adequate diene (under Diels-Alder conditions) and then fully reducing the<br>
naphthalenone obtained. The examples herein below provided specific examples of this<br>
synthetic approach.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl3<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for 1H and 13C, the chemical<br>
displacements 8 are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the coupling<br>
constants J are expressed in Hz.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of perhvdro-6.8.8a-trimethyl-1-naphthalenol<br>
I) General procedure for the Diels-Alder coupling<br>
In a 500 ml reactor were introduced AlEtCl2, or AlCl3, 0.1 g of BHT and toluene, or<br>
CH2Cl2. Then, under vigorous stirring, was added the appropriate cyclohexenone<br>
dropwise, so as to maintain the temperature below 30°C. Afterwards was added the diene<br>
dropwise and, when the reaction ended, the reaction mixture was hydrolyzed with 5%<br>
aqueous HC1, extracted twice with Et2O. The organic layer was then washed with a<br>
saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution, water, brine and then dried over Na2SO4.<br>
Evaporation of the solvents, chromatography (SiO2, elution heptane/AcOEt 98:2) and<br>
distillation provided the unsaturated naphthalenone.<br>
II) General procedure for the hydrogenation of the unsaturated naphthalenone into the<br>
perhydro naphthalenone<br>
In a 100 ml flask were introduced the appropriate unsaturated naphthalenone, ethyl acetate<br>
and 10% w/w, relative to the unsaturated naphdialenone, of Pd/C 5%. The mixture was<br>
thus stirred under H2, at a room temperature, until consumption of the theoretical amount<br>
of hydrogen. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was filtered over Nylon 6/6. Evaporation of<br>
the solvents and distillation provided the perhydro naphthalenone.<br>
III) General procedure for the reduction of the perhydro naphthalenone into the<br>
perhydro naphthalenol<br>
In a 100 ml flask, maintained under Ar atmosphere, were introduced 2 molar equivalents,<br>
with respect of the ketone, of LiAlH4 in Et2O. Then the appropriate perhydro<br>
naphdialenone was added dropwise, so as to maintain the reflux. After completion of the<br>
reaction, the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at reflux. Afterwards the reaction mixture<br>
was hydrolyzed with a stoechiometric amount of aqueous NaOH and the organic layer<br>
was dried over Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvents and distillation provided the perhydro<br>
naphthalenol.<br>
