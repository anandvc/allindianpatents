ELECTRICALLY HEATED PARTICULATE FILTER PREPARATION METHODS<br>
AND SYSTEMS<br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0001] This invention was produced pursuant to U.S. Government<br>
Contract No. DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 with the Department of Energy (DoE). The<br>
U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
heating particulate filters.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Diesel engines typically have higher efficiency than gasoline<br>
engines due to an increased compression ratio and a higher energy density of<br>
diesel fuel. A diesel combustion cycle produces particulates that are typically<br>
filtered from diesel exhaust by a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed in the<br>
exhaust stream. Over time, the PF becomes full and the trapped diesel<br>
particulates must be removed. During regeneration, the diesel particulates are<br>
burned within the PF.<br>
1<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
[0005] Some regeneration methods ignite particulate matter present on<br>
the front of the PF via a front surface heater. Regeneration of particulate matter<br>
present inside the PF is then achieved using the heat generated by combustion<br>
of particulate matter present near the heated face of the PF or by the heated<br>
exhaust passing through the PF. In some cases, the combustion of the<br>
particulate matter within the PF can be extinguished before regeneration has<br>
completed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, a control system that controls regeneration of a<br>
particulate filter is provided. The system generally includes a fuel control module<br>
that controls injection of fuel into exhaust that passes through the particulate<br>
filter. A regeneration module controls current to the particulate filter to initiate<br>
regeneration after the fuel has been injected into the exhaust.<br>
[0007] In other features, a method of controlling regeneration of a<br>
particulate filter is provided. The method generally includes: injecting fuel into<br>
exhaust that passes through the particulate filter; and controlling current to the<br>
particulate filter to initiate regeneration after the fuel has been injected into the<br>
exhaust.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0019] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 including an<br>
exemplary diesel engine system 11 is illustrated in accordance with various<br>
aspects of the present teachings. It is appreciated that the diesel engine system<br>
11 is merely exemplary in nature and that the particulate filter preparation system<br>
described herein can be implemented in various engine systems implementing a<br>
particulate filter. Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to,<br>
gasoline direct injection engine systems and homogeneous charge compression<br>
ignition engine systems. For ease of the discussion, the disclosure will be<br>
discussed in the context of a diesel engine system.<br>
[0020] A turbocharged diesel engine system 11 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air<br>
entering the system 10. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br>
4<br><br>
GM.Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0021] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are illustrated, it is appreciated that the systems and<br>
methods of the present disclosure can be implemented in engines having a<br>
plurality of cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12<br>
cylinders. It is also appreciated that the systems and methods of the present<br>
disclosure can be implemented in a v-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is injected<br>
into the cylinders 26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites<br>
the air/fuel mixture. Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust. Exhaust<br>
exits the cylinders 26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0022] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (DOC) 32, and a particulate filter (PF) 34. Optionally, an EGR<br>
valve (not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake<br>
manifold 22. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to<br>
drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received<br>
from the air filter 14. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the DOC<br>
32 and the PF 34. The DOC 32 oxidizes the exhaust based on the post<br>
combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount of oxidation increases the temperature of<br>
the exhaust. The PF 34 receives exhaust from the DOC 32 and filters any<br>
particulates present in the exhaust.<br>
[0023] A control module 44 controls the engine and PF regeneration<br>
based on various sensed and/or modeled information. More specifically, the<br>
5<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
control module 44 estimates loading of the PF 34. When the estimated loading<br>
achieves a threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter of particulate matter) and the<br>
exhaust flow rate is within a desired range, current is controlled to the PF 34 via<br>
a power source 46 to initiate the regeneration process. The duration of the<br>
regeneration process varies based upon the amount of particulate matter within<br>
the PF 34. It is anticipated, that the regeneration process can last between 1 - 6<br>
minutes. Current is only applied, however, during an initial portion of the<br>
regeneration process. More specifically, the electric energy heats the face of the<br>
PF 34 for a threshold period (e.g., 1 - 2 minutes). Exhaust passing through the<br>
front face is heated. The remainder of the regeneration process is achieved<br>
using the heat generated by combustion of particulate matter present near the<br>
heated face of the PF 34 or by the heated exhaust passing through the PF 34.<br>
[0024] In some cases, the combustion of the particulate matter within<br>
the PF 34 is extinguished by certain engine operating conditions. For example,<br>
the regeneration can be extinguished by an engine acceleration event. To<br>
prevent such extinguishment, the control module 44 pretreats the PF 34 with fuel<br>
based on sensor signals and/or modeled data and the particulate filter<br>
preparation methods and systems of the present disclosure. The pretreatment of<br>
fuel increases the heat levels of combustion in the PF 34 to prevent the<br>
extinguishment of the combustion.<br>
[0025] In various embodiments, an exhaust temperature sensor 47<br>
generates an exhaust temperature signal based on a temperature of the exhaust.<br>
A mass airflow sensor 48 generates an exhaust air signal based on air entering<br>
6<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
or exiting the engine 12. A current and/or voltage sensor 49 generates a current<br>
and/or voltage signal based on the voltage and/or current supplied by the power<br>
source 46 to the PF 34. An oxygen sensor 51 generates an oxygen level signal<br>
based on a level of oxygen in the exhaust. In various embodiments, the control<br>
module 44 receives the signals and pretreats the PF 34 with fuel while controlling<br>
a combustion temperature such that the heat is not excessive. The pretreatment<br>
of fuel can be achieved, for example, by injecting fuel in the exhaust after the<br>
combustion cycle via, for example, the fuel injector 28 or a post fuel injector 53<br>
that injects fuel into the exhaust.<br>
[0026] With particular reference to Figure 2, the PF 34 is preferably a<br>
monolith particulate trap and includes alternating closed cells/channels 50 and<br>
opened cells/channels 52. The cells/channels 50, 52 are typically square cross-<br>
sections, running axially through the part. Walls 58 of the PF 34 are preferably<br>
comprised of a porous ceramic honeycomb wall of cordierite material. It is<br>
appreciated that any ceramic comb material is considered within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure. Adjacent channels are alternatively plugged at each end as<br>
shown at 56. This forces the diesel aerosol through the porous substrate walls<br>
which act as a mechanical filter. Particulate matter is deposited within the closed<br>
channels 50 and exhaust exits through the opened channels 52. Particles 59<br>
flow into the PF 34 and are trapped therein.<br>
[0027] For regeneration purposes, a grid 64 including an electrically<br>
resistive material is attached to the front exterior surface referred to as the front<br>
face of the PF 34. Current is supplied to the resistive material to generate<br>
7<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
thermal energy. It is appreciated that thick film heating technology may be used<br>
to attach the grid 64 to the PF 34. For example, a heating material such as Silver<br>
or Nichrome may be coated then etched or applied with a mask to the front face<br>
of the PF 34. In various other embodiments, the grid 64 is composed of<br>
electrically resistive material such as stainless steel and attached to the PF 34<br>
using an adhesive or press fit to the PF 34.<br>
[0028] It is also appreciated that the resistive material may be applied<br>
in various single or multi-path patterns as shown in Figure 3. Segments of<br>
resistive material can be removed to generate the pathways. In various<br>
embodiments a perforated heater insert 70 as shown in Figure 4 may be<br>
attached to the front face of the PF 34. In any of the above mentioned<br>
embodiments, exhaust passing through the PF 34 carries thermal energy<br>
generated at the front face of the PF 34 a short distance down the channels 50,<br>
52. The increased thermal energy ignites particulate matter present near the<br>
inlet of the PF 34. The heat generated from the combustion of the particulates is<br>
then directed through the PF 34 to induce combustion of the remaining<br>
particulates within the PF 34.<br>
[0029] With particular reference to Figure 5, a thermally conductive<br>
coating 72 can be additionally applied at the inlets 62 of the channels 50, 52.<br>
The coating 72 can extend a short distance down the opened ends of the closed<br>
channels 50. In various embodiments, the conductive coating extends within an<br>
inch of the front face of the PF 34. The resistive material of the grid 64 contacts<br>
the conductive coating 72. Thermal energy is transferred to the conductive<br>
8<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 854OP-OO0479<br>
coating 72 when electrical energy passes through the resistive material. Heat<br>
from the conductive coating 72 ignites particulate matter present near the inlet of<br>
the PF 34.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 6, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
embodiments of a particulate filter preparation system that may be embedded<br>
within the control module 44. Various embodiments of particulate filter<br>
preparation systems according to the present disclosure may include any number<br>
of sub-modules embedded within the control module 44. As can be appreciated,<br>
the sub-modules shown in Figure 6 may be combined and/or further partitioned<br>
to similarly control regeneration of the PF 34. Inputs to the system may be<br>
sensed from the vehicle 10 (Figure 1), received from other control modules (not<br>
shown) within the vehicle 10 (Figure 1), and/or determined by other sub-modules<br>
(not shown) within the control module 44. In various embodiments, the control<br>
module 44 of Figure 6 includes a regeneration control module 80, a fuel control<br>
module 82, and a temperature control module 84.<br>
[0031] The regeneration control module 80 receives as input a<br>
particulate matter level 86 indicating an estimated level of accumulated<br>
particulate matter present in the PF 34 (Figure 1) and an exhaust flow 88. Based<br>
on the particulate matter level 86 and the exhaust flow 88, the regeneration<br>
control module 80 determines whether regeneration is desired. For example, if<br>
the accumulated particulate matter level 86 is high and the exhaust flow 88 is<br>
sufficient to carry the combustion, the regeneration control module 80 determines<br>
that regeneration is desired. If regeneration is desired, the regeneration control<br>
9<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
module 80 sets a regeneration status 90 to indicate that regeneration is desired.<br>
In various embodiments, the regeneration status 90 can be an enumeration that<br>
includes values for representing at least 'regeneration not desired,' 'regeneration<br>
desired,' and 'regeneration in progress.'<br>
[0032] The regeneration control module 80 can also receive as input a<br>
fuel status 92 and a combustion temperature 93. Once the fuel status 92<br>
indicates that fuel pretreatment is complete (as will be discussed below), the<br>
regeneration control module 80 generates a heater control signal 94 that controls<br>
current to the PF 34 (Figure 1) to heat the face of the PF 34 (Figure 1) and the<br>
regeneration status 90 is set to indicate that regeneration is in progress. Once<br>
regeneration is complete for example, when the combustion temperature 93<br>
indicates regeneration is complete, the regeneration control module 80, sets the<br>
regeneration status 90 to indicate that regeneration is complete.<br>
[0033] The fuel control module 82 receives as input the regeneration<br>
status 90. If the regeneration status 90 indicates that regeneration is desired, the<br>
fuel control module 82 generates a fuel control signal 95 to pretreat the PF 34<br>
(Figure 1) by controlling the injection of fuel into the exhaust stream or directly<br>
into the PF 34 (Figure 1). Once the fuel pretreatment is complete, the fuel<br>
control module 82 sets the fuel status 92 to indicate that the fuel pretreatment is<br>
complete. For example, the fuel status 92 is set equal to TRUE when the fuel<br>
pretreatment is complete and the fuel status 92 is set equal to FALSE when the<br>
fuel pretreatment is not complete.<br>
10<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
[0034] The temperature control module 84 receives as input the<br>
regeneration status 90, an oxygen level 96, an exhaust flow 98, an exhaust<br>
temperature 100, and a grid temperature 102. In various embodiments, the grid<br>
temperature 102 is determined based on the voltage and/or current signal.<br>
When the regeneration status 90 indicates that regeneration is in progress, the<br>
temperature control module 84 evaluates the oxygen level 96, the exhaust flow<br>
98, the exhaust temperature 100, and the grid temperature 102 to estimate the<br>
combustion temperature 93. If the combustion temperature 93 is too high, the<br>
temperature control module 84 controls the fuel and/or the air to the engine 12<br>
(Figure 1) via fuel parameters 104 and/or air parameters 106 to limit the peak<br>
combustion temperature and thus, prevent damage to the PF 34.<br>
[0035] Referring not to Figure 7, a flowchart illustrates an exemplary<br>
particulate filter preparation method that can be performed by the particulate filter<br>
preparation system of Figure 6 in accordance with various aspects of the present<br>
disclosure. As can be appreciated, the order of execution of the steps of the<br>
exemplary particulate filter preparation method can vary without altering the spirit<br>
of the method. The exemplary particulate filter preparation method may be<br>
performed periodically during control module operation or scheduled to run<br>
based on certain events.<br>
[0036] In one example, the method may begin at 200. The PF 34<br>
(Figure 1) is evaluated to determine if regeneration is desired at 210. If the PF<br>
34 (Figure 1) is full and regeneration is desired at 210, the PF 34 (Figure 1) is<br>
pretreated with fuel at 220. Current is applied to PF 34 (Figure 1) to initiate<br>
11<br><br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-309161-PTE-CD<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000479<br>
regeneration at 230. During regeneration at 240, the combustion temperature 93<br>
is monitored at 250. If the combustion temperature 93 is high (i.e. greater than a<br>
predetermined threshold) at 250, temperature control is performed to limit the<br>
peak temperature of the combustion during regeneration at 260. If, however, the<br>
combustion temperature 93 is normal at 150, regeneration continues. After<br>
regeneration has completed at 240, the method may end at 270.<br>
[0037] Referring now to Figure 8, a flowchart illustrates an exemplary<br>
temperature control method of the particulate filter preparation method that can<br>
be performed by the particulate filter preparation system of Figure 6 in<br>
accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. As can be<br>
appreciated, the order of execution of the steps of the exemplary temperature<br>
control method can vary without altering the spirit of the method. The exemplary<br>
temperature control method may be performed periodically during control module<br>
operation or scheduled to run based on certain events.<br>
[0038] In one example, the method may begin at 300. The combustion<br>
temperature 93 of the particulate matter is estimated at 310 and evaluated at<br>
320. If the combustion temperature 93 is too high (i.e., greater than a threshold)<br>
at 320, the combustion temperature 93 is limited at 330 by controlling engine<br>
parameters such as, for example, engine air and/or fuel. The method may end at<br>
340.<br>
[0039] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>

disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
