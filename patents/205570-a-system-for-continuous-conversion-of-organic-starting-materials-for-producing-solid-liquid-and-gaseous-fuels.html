Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to continuous conversion of organic starting material such as bio-mass of vegetable, microbial or animal origin and garbage/ sludges containing organic material to solid, liquid aid gaseous fuels involving heating in the absence of air (anaerobically) to temperatures preferably between 280 and 320 °C and in particular to a system for continuous conversion of organic starting materials to generate solid, liquid and gaseous fuels involving such process of tow temperature conversion which would be energy efficient ,compact, easily portable and assembled at site and thus user friendly . Importantly, the system of the invention is adapted for a simple and cost effective application in producing solid, liquid and gaseous fuels from organic starting material avoiding complexities such as to favour wide scale application and use for such conversion of the organic starting materials.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is well known to heat treat decomposable material such as organic , starting materials to convert the same into usable products such as solid, liquid and gaseous fuels.<br>
A process for the conversion of sewage sludge to produce oils has been disclosed in European Patent Application No. 81109604.9, filed Nov. 10th 1981 by Prof. Dr. Ernst Bayer and published May 26th 1982 (Pub. No. AZ 0 052 334), and has been described by E. Bayer and M. Kutubuddin of Tubingen University, Federal Republic of Germany, in several articles, for example, in "Ol aus Mull and Schlamm" at pages 68-77 of Bild der Wissenschaft, Issue 9(1981); in "Ol aus Klarschlamm" at pages 377-381 of Abwasser, Issue 29(1982); and in "Low Temperature Conversion of Sludge and Water to Oil" in the Proceedings of the International Recycling Congress, 1982, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany. The process has been demonstrated on both batch and continuous laboratory scale systems, and basically comprises heating dried sludge slowly with the<br><br>
-3-<br>
exclusion of air to a conversion temperature of 280.degree.-600.degree. C. for about 30-180 minutes, the vapours being condensed to generate a crude oil and the solid residue being coal-like. Importantly, the above process can be operated at only slightly above atmospheric pressure and no additives are required. The process is stated to demonstrate oil yields ranging from 18-27% and char yields from 50-60%, the oil having a heating value of about 39 MJ/kg and the char of about 15, MJ/kg.<br>
US 5,114,541 also discloses the process for producing solidjiquid and gaseous fuels comprising the use of an organic starting material selected from a bio-mass of microbial .vegetable or animal origin and sediments of garbage containing organic material ,heating said organic material under the exclusion of air slowly to a conversion temperature of 200 to 600 C , conducting the gases and vapour escaping during the heating through suitable gas and liquid separators maintaining the conversion temperature until the development of gases and vapours has substantially ceased , and isolating the solid conversion residues and the separated gases and liquids.<br>
This Bayer process is simple and in effect, is close to the natural process of oil synthesis. At the low levels of energy input used, with the exclusion of oxygen, the proteins and lipids in the sludge are converted to oil and the carbohydrates to the coal-like material, the process being catalysed if necessary by the addition of suitable materials. Importantly, in the case of sewage sludge in most cases the addition of catalyst material is not required since the inorganic components present in the sludge contain a sufficient amount of catalyst in the form of silicates, aluminum compounds and transition metals. The heterobonds (C-S, C-N, O-P, C~ O) are broken, but not the C-C bonds, resulting in a hydrocarbon mix very similar to natural crude oil. According to the process the maximum oil yield was achieved at an operating temperature of 280.degree.C.to320.degree.C.<br><br>

For processing of sludge variety of reactors have been in use. US Patent 3956076 discloses a vertical pyrolysis reactor which uses an inside gas supply for heating. US 3970524 discloses the provision of a retort type reactor. US395890 discloses the reactor involving conical outlet for decompose products. A slightly higher than the outside pressure is maintained with the reaction chamber in order to maintain anaerobic conditions.<br>
US3971704 discloses a vertical reaction chamber for processing of waste, which utilizes a hood, or bent type inlet, a water sealed outlet. Hot gases do the heating externally and also internally. US4082615 discloses a reactor for thermal decomposition of solid organic wastes which involves the use of fluidized bed. US4098649 discloses a reactor for anaerobic conversion of organic material involving a extruder type reactor.<br>
US4618735 discloses an apparatus for the conversion of sludge comprising an enclosure establishing a heated heating zone having an inlet thereto for dried sewage sludge and separate outlet there form for heating zone gaseous products and residual heating zone solid products; conveyor means within the heating zone enclosure for conveying solid products from its inlet to its solid products outlet; an enclosure establishing a heated reaction zone having separate inlet thereto for gaseous and solid products and separate outlets thereform for gaseous and solid products;conveyor means within the reaction zone enclosure for conveying solid products from solid products inlet to its solid product outlet;a heating zone solid products outlet being connected to the reaction zone solid products inlet for passage of solid products between them; and duct means connecting the heating zone gaseous products outlet to the reaction zone gaseous products inlet<br>
US5865956 discloses yet another apparatus for the conversion of organic sludge, the apparatus comprising a feed system for dried slubge to be conveyed, a first reactor, a second reactor, a condenser system and an oil / water separation system, the first reactor having a transfer line provided for transfer for gaseous products to the condenser system and / or oil /<br><br>
water separation system, the condenser system and / or oil / water separation system having a transferred line provided for re-injection of oil for oil and non-condensable products into the second reactor, the second reactor being adapted to contact the heated sludge residue from the first reactor with the oil or oil non condensable products of the condenser system and / or oil / water separation system, wherein gaseous products may be removed from the second reactor.<br>
Also a further reactor for the Bayer low temperature conversion is described in the thesis of Michel Faubel, "Niedertemperaturfconvertierung von Hausmuell Juebingen 1992" which involves the use of conveyor systems to carry the substrate to the reactor. In particular such reactor involves three conveyors shiftedly arranged which are driven by toothwheels on the axis and in turn by an electro-motor through gears. Screw means are used to move the substrate into the reactor. According to the substrate the screws in tubes can be moved and fixed more or less into tubes so that an optimal air blocking by an optimal stability of the plug results. The substrate is moved as a plug above the beginning of the first conveyor .there it is cut off, mixed up and distributed continuously on the conveyor by a rotating plate .after the substrate has passed the reaction chamber, the coal residues fell into a screw drain,where it is moved by a screw into the coal storage unit.the coal storage is required to be emptied during operation.<br>
It would be clearly apparent from the above that while the processes involving low temperature conversion especially the Bayer LTC is available to the art for generating solid, liquid and gaseous fuels from organic starting materials by heating in the absence of air in temperature in the range 280-320°C, most of the reactors presently in use for continuous conversion involve essentially either complex mechanical equipments like screw and belt conveyors for moving the reaction material or complex unite/gadgets such as a fluidized bed. Such systems for continuous.conversion of organic materials are therefore, complex and cost expensive to apply in use for such conversion. Moreover inspite of the complexity in mechanism in such know reactors there are still<br><br>
-6-<br>
limitations in capacity for continuous operation due to various constraints such as limited on-line storage facilities and the like. Importantly, while it is expected that the organic material production will be high in the years to come and the ever increasing difficulty in disposal of such organic materials due to environmental concerns, need exists in the art for sludge conversion system / devices which would on one hand be simple to obtain and operate and on the other hand would be cost effective so as to make it widely acceptable and user friendly in the handling and continuous conversion of such organic materials.<br>

-14-<br>
In accordance with yet another preferred aspect of the present invention the system for continuous conversion of organic starting material to generate solid, liquid and gaseous fuels comprises:<br>

It would be apparent from the above systems for conversion of organic starting material in accordance with the invention that the same provides for a simple and cost effective device for conversion of organic starting material to generate solid, liquid and gaseous fuels. Importantly, the system while being simple and user friendly is adapted for continuous conversion by efficiently heating the badly heat conducting materials by way of simple manual operation free of any mechanical guides and / or gas circulating system and/or conveyor means to traverse the substrate in the reactors. The system is compact and portable which add to the wider acceptability and use especially in remote locations. The system is adapted by way of the efficient pre-heating of the substrate to convert the rough materials like municipal waste without requiring fine shredding.<br>
Importantly also, the inlet to the two chamber reactors comprising the upper and the lower reactor units have been selectively provided so as to favour preventing the exchange of gases and / or air to and from the outside of the reaction chamber to facilitate effective conversion.<br>
Advantageously, the outlet for solid fuel generated by the system comprise of atleast one converging outlet and disposed such that a lower temperature is maintained at the end and higher temperature at the entry to prevent air flowing into the reactor. Also such an arrangement for the outlet facilitate manual removable of the generated coal, which again contributes towards making the reactor more compact ,user friendly and cost effective. Furthermore, the lower chamber external heating is found<br><br>
-16-<br>
to be sufficient and no water sea! or mechanical sealing mechanism is required by the system.<br>
The system of the invention involving the upper and lower reactor can be comprised of a cylindrical / tubular member which is constructed at an angle of the bore axis in the range of 30° to 90° respective to the horizontal such that the substrate is moved by the gravitation without the need for any additional complex external drive system. However, if desired optionally the movement can be further activated by use of simple manual sticks or mechanical devices. The reactor can be construed linear or bent maintaining the desired functional characteristics detailed above.<br>
The reactor can be constructed of material selected from steel, stones, brick, concrete and the like or mixtures thereof. In accordance with the preferred aspects, the reactor can be covered by the insulated material like glass wool, stone wool or asbestos.<br>
As apparent from the above, the system of the invention basically involves two reactor units comprising an upper reactor unit and the lower reactor unit. In the upper reactor unit the substrate is basically pre-heated and dried while on the lower reactor unit the substrate is converted into coal, evaporated oil and water and gas.<br>
Advantageously, the inlet of both the chambers comprise of converging funnel shaped inlet directing into the chamber. Such converging inlet provide for preventing gas / air communication into the reactor unit from outside<br>
Along with the converging funnel shape inlets, the system effectively provide for the outlet for gases and vapors emerging from the substrate in the upper chamber which are disposed or can be used for further heat exchange. The converging inlet compresses the substrate so that any exchange of gases to and from outside the reaction chamber is prevented. No screw and other means are required to block the flow of gases. The system is adapted for direct feeding in of Municipal wastes as a substrate<br><br>
-17-<br>
as it is since it is only the pieces of more than 1 Kg which need to be shreded . The generated hot gases exchange heat through the inlet preheating the substrate and cooling down at the same time. The compressed waste at the inlets loosens while entering the chamber, so gases can pass through the substrate and the gas flow needs to be open space adjacent to the inlet.<br>
The outlet of the lower chamber consists of a converging outlet. The lower part of the outlet is cooled by air or by a water jacket. The upper part is heated by burning fuel required to heat the lower reactor. The hot smoke gases of the burning fuel are lead into the upper chamber for preheating and drying the substrate. In the lower chamber the substrate is converted into coal, evaporated oil, water and gas. The generated coal is passed through the outlet The converging outlet combined with the lower temperature at the end and higher temperature at the start of the outlet prevents air flowing into the reactor. This type of outlet enables manual removable of the generated coal that make the reactor more compact and reduces the investments. In the lower chamber external heating is sufficient as the system effectively utilizes the slightly exothermic reaction of the Bayer LTC No water seal and mechanical sealing mechanism is required.<br>
The upper chamber is heated by passing hot gases of the burnt fuel directly into the chamber. The organic materials are bad conductor to heat; therefore, such dined heating makes the same much mor6 efficient compared to external heating. The hot smoke gases are generating as an additional heat cushion and reduce the oxygen content in the upper chamber, which prevents oxygen from the lower reaction chamber.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the continuous conversion of organic starting materials selectively to solid, liquid or gaseous fuel using the above disclosed system of the invention comprising;<br><br>
-18-<br>
feeding the organic starting material from the top of said upper reactor through the downwardly converging inlet , subjecting the organic starting material to pre- heating in the upper reactor unit by hot gases of the burnt fuel used in heating the lower reactor unit;<br>

Reference is first invited to Figure 1, which shows an embodiment of the system in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated in the said figure, the system comprises of a substantially cylindrical main reactor wall (1) which houses the Upper Reactor Unit (2) and the Lower Reactor Unit (3). In particular, as illustrated in said figure, the Upper Reactor Unit (2) comprises a downwardly converging inlet (4) adapted to favor gravity feed of the organic starting material from the top through a central opening (5). The converging inlet (4) further prevents any air / gas communication there between the reactor inside and the outside. To facilitate exiting of the smoke gas / vapor from the upper reactor unit (2) a smoke gas / vapour outlet (6) is defined there between the external wall (7) of the converging inlet and the inner face of the reactor wall (1'). Likewise the upper reactor unit (2), the lower reactor (3) unit is also provided with a converging inlet (8) having a central opening (9) for gravity feeding of the pre-heated material into the<br><br>
-20-<br>
lower reactor (3). As further illustrated the lower reactor (3) unit is provided with two downwardly converging outlets (10) for outlet of the solid fuel / coal generated. The gas / oil vapor from the lower reactor (3) unit is lead to a condensing unit via outlets (11) defined with respect to the external (8') of the converging inlet (8) and the internal wall (3') of the lower reactor (3).<br>
Advantageously, in order to facilitate heating of the lower chamber, furnace means (13) are disposed in the bottom of the lower reactor unit (3). Advantageously, apart from serving the basic purpose of heating the lower reactor unit (3), the gas / smoke generated by heating of the furnace means (13) are selectively allowed to traverse to the upper reactor unit (2) through communicating passages (14) which facilitate pre-heating of the organic material in the upper chamber (2) prior to is final heating in the lower chamber (3) to generate the coal.<br>
Importantly, as further illustrated, the outlet (10) of the lower reactor (3) is disposed such that the lower part of the outlet (10') is cooled by air or by a water jacket while the upper part (10") is heated by the burning fuel required to heat the lower reactor. The converging outlet combined with the lower temperature at the end and higher temperature at the entry of the outlet prevents air flowing into the reactor. This type of outlet further enables manual removable of the generated coal that make the reactor more compact and reduces the investments. In the lower chamber external heating is sufficient as the system effectively utilizes the slightly exothermic reaction of the Bayer LTC No water seal and mechanical sealing mechanism is required.<br>
Reference is now invited to Figure 2 which illustrates another embodiment of the system in accordance with the invention. As shown in said figure, in this embodiment also the system comprises of an upper reactor unit (2) and a lower reactor unit (3) operatively connected. Likewise the earlier embodiment, the upper reactor (2) is provided with a converging inlet (4) for gravity feed of the contents without allowing any gas / air into the reactor unit. Also as in the earlier embodiment, the smoke gas vapor outlet (6) is provided in the upper reactor unit (2). The smoke gas outlet (6) is defined by the external wall (7) of the converging inlet (4) and the inside of the reactor wall (1). However, in this embodiment, the lower reactor unit (3) and the converging outlet (10) are integrally formed as a conical shaped unit which is angularly disposed such that the converging inlet (8) portion constitute a top part of the lower reactor<br><br>
-21-<br>
(3) with a portion thereof maintaining operative communication with the upper reactor chamber (2) so as to define a converging inlet (8) for the feed from the upper reactor unit (2) into the lower reactor unit (3). The outlet (11) for the gas / oil vapor from the lower reactor (3) is operatively connected to a condensing unit (not shown) The outlet (11) is defined as a tubular protruding portion from lower reactor (3). In accordance with the other aspect of the system of the invention, the furnace means (13) is provided to heat the lower reactor unit (3) and also the generated smoke and gas is transmitted through the passage (14) to the upper reactor unit for pre-heating of the organic material.<br>
It would be clearly apparent from the above two illustrative embodiments of the system of the invention that the same clearly and sufficiently provides for effective utilization of the heat energy used / generated in the process and ensures a compact dual chamber reactor system wherein in the upper chamber the organic material can be pre-heated and dried for final conversion in the lower chamber. The converging inlet for the organic material in the two chambers and also the product generation through the converging outlet is provided to facilitate manual operation of the system without need for external aids.<br>
Importantly, the converging outlet of the lower chamber (3) is so disposed with respect to the furnace means (13) such that only the upper part of the outlet (10) get heated by the burning fuel while the lower part (10') is maintained cool by air and / or by water jacket. Such a converging outlet (10) combined with the lower temperature at the end and higher temperature at the entry of the outlet prevent air flowing into the reactor. Also such outlet facilitate manual removable of the generated coal and make the reactor more compact and cost effective.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying Figures 3A to 3D which show further embodiments of possible converging inlet for the organic starting material in the system for continuous conversion in accordance with the present invention. As shown in Figure 3A, the inlet can comprise of a funnel shaped converging inlet (4) for the substrate with a substantially centrally disposed opening (5) .The gas vapor outlet (6) is shown defined long the internal (1') of the reactor wall (1) and the external (7) of the converging inlet<br>
(4).<br><br>
-22-<br>
Reference is now invited to Figure 3B which shows another embodiment of the inlet for the substrate in the system. In this embodiment, a converging inlet (4) is disposed to provide for a converging inlet with respect to the peripheral wall (1) of the reactor and also the gas / vapour outlet wall(6').<br>
In Figure 3C, yet another embodiment of the converging inlet is shown which is substantially similar to that of the embodiment of Figure 3A except that the converging wall of the inlet (4) defines a spherical profile (4') rather than an angular disposition. The outlet (6) for the gas vapor along the wall of the reactor is also shown in the figure.<br>
Reference is now invited in Figure 3D which shows yet another embodiment of the inlet for the system of the invention. In this embodiment the reactor as such is shown angularly disposed and the substrate inlet comprises of two converging inlets (4' &amp; 4") with gas outlets (6). In this embodiment also the aspect of converging inlet for the substrate and the outlet for the gas vapor is maintained in accordance with the system of the invention.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompany Figures 4A to 4D which show further possible varieties of embodiment constituting the outlet of the lower reactor (3) for the system in accordance with the invention.<br>
As illustrated in said Figure 4A, according to this embodiment the outlet comprises of a converging outlet (10) substantially centrally disposed with respect to the reactor periphery. The furnace means (13) are shown adjacent the entry end of the outlet while the far end of the outlet is maintained cool and away from the furnace.<br>
Reference is now invited to Figure 4B which shows yet another embodiment of the outlet (10) in accordance with the invention. In this embodiment also, the outlet comprise the converging outlet, comprising of two converging outlets (10' &amp; 10") with an intermediate central passage (14) for the smoke and gases from the furnace to the upper reactor unit. The furnace means (13) is shown disposed adjacent the entry point of the outlets while the far end of the outlets are maintained cool.<br><br>
-23-<br>
Reference is now invited to Figure 4C which shows yet another embodiment of the outlet for the system of the invention. As shown in said figure, the outlet is similar to the one provided in the system shown in Figure 2. In this case the lower reactor (3) and the outlet (10) is integrally formed as a conical shaped unit The furnace means (13) and the communicating passage (14) for the smoke / gases to the upper reactor unit are also illustrated. The entry end of the outlet is close to the furnace means while the far end of the outlet is maintained cool.<br>
Reference is further invited to Figure 4D which illustrates yet another embodiment of the outlet in accordance with the system of the invention. In this embodiment a pair converging outlets(10) are provided with intermediate provision for furnace means (13) and communicating passage(14) for the smoke and gas to the upper reactor unit.<br>
It would be apparent from the various embodiment discussed above that all the outlet variants define converging outlets and the furnace means is selectively disposed adjacent the entry point of the outlet while far end of the outlet is maintained cool. Such converging outlet combined with lower temperature at the end and higher temperature at the start of the outlet prevent air flowing into the reactor. This type of outlet enables manual removable of the generated coal and facilitate providing a compact and cost effective system for conversion of organic starting material for solid , liquid and gaseous fuel.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide a system for continuous conversion of organic starting material for producing solid, liquid and gaseous fuels which would be energy efficient and yet simple and cost effective to obtain .Importantly, the system is adapted for simple manual operation without complexities of using mechanical drives or screws, conveyor means and gas circulating systems thereby providing for its wide scale use / application in organic material conversion . The system is compact, portable and effective and therefore, user friendly for large-scale application and use even in remote rural locations and adapted to meet the challenges of organic material disposal and generation of valuable solid, liquid and gaseous fuel in an environment friendly manner.<br><br>

The above system for continuous conversion of organic starting materials to generate solid, liquid and gaseous fuels involves a low temperature conversion which would be energy efficient apart from being compact, easily portable and assembled at site and thus user friendly.</td>
