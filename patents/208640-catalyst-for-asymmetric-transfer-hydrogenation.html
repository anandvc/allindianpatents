CATALYST FOR ASYMMETRIC (TRANSFER) HYDROGENATION<br>
The invention relates to a catalyst for the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation that contains a transition metal compound and a chiral ligand.<br>
Such catalysts are known from G. Francio, F. Faraone and W. Leitner, Angewandte Chemie. Int. Ed 2000, 39, 1428-1430. This publication describes the use of bidentate phosphine phosphorus amidite ligands for the asymmetric hydrogenation of substituted olefins with enantioselectivities of up to 98.8%.<br>
A drawback of the known catalysts is that the ligands used are generally prepared via many reaction steps, a number of which often proceed with a low yield. This makes these ligands extremely expensive. Another drawback of these phosphine containing ligands is that they are relatively sensitive to oxygen, which causes problems in handling them in practice.<br>
The invention now provides a catalyst consisting of a transition metal catalyst and a chiral ligand in which the ligand can simply be prepared in one or two steps from commercially available starting materials.<br>
According to the invention this is achieved with a catalyst represented by the formula ML3XbSc, where M is a transition metal, to be chosen from rhodium and ruthenium, L is an enantiomerically enriched chiral monodentate ligand having the formula (I),<br><br>
where Cn together with the two 0-atoms and the P-atom forms a substituted or non-substituted ring with 2-4 C-atoms, R^ and R^ each independently stand for H, an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, aralkyi or alkaryl group, or may form a (heterocyclic) ring together with the N-atom to which they are bound, X is a counter ion and S is a ligand, a ranges from 0.5 to 3, b and c each independently range from 0 to 2. Preferably R^ and R^ each independently represent an alky! group, for instance an alky! group with 1-6 C-atoms, in particular 1-3 C-atoms, most preferably Ci and C2 represent a methyl group. The alkyl, aryl, aralkyi and alkaryl groups preferably have 1-20 C-atoms and can optionally be substituted with for instance one or more hydroxy, alkoxy, nitrile or carboxylic ester groups.<br><br>
or halogens. R1 and/or R2 may be part of a polymeric backbone.<br>
It has, surprisingly, been found that a high enantioselectivity can be achieved in the asymmetric hydrogenation or asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of olefins, ketones and imines when using the monodentate iigands of formula (I), which can be prepared in a simple manner. This is all the more surprising since it is generally assumed that bidentate Iigands are needed to achieve a high enantioselectivity. Another advantage of the catalysts according to the invention is that the reaction rate increases with increasing pressure, without the enantioselectivity decreasing. As a result, a lower amount of catalyst will suffice or a faster reaction can be obtained. Yet another advantage is that the Iigands according to the invention are virtually not sensitive to oxygen. Using a catalyst according to the invention in the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation of a prochiral compound, enantiomerically enriched compounds can be obtained with an ee of &gt; 90%, in particular &gt; 95%, more in particular &gt; 98%.<br>
The catalyst according to the invention represented by the formula MLaXbSc may be neutral, anionic or cationic. The catalyst according to the invention may consist of a preformed complex having the formula MLaXbSc- These complexes can be prepared by reacting the chiral ligand with a catalyst precursor Preferably, however, the catalyst is formed in situ by adding the chiral ligand to a solution of a catalyst precursor which may contain a ligand that is easily removed by hydrogenation. The amount of optically active ligand to be added for example may range from 0.5 to 5, preferably from 1 to 3.5, equivalents relative to the metal Preferably a small excess of optically active ligand is applied relative to the desired amount of optically active ligand in the catalyst. The optimum ratio of optically active ligand to metal in the catalyst may differ per optically active ligand and per metal and can readily be determined by means of experiments.<br>
The catalyst can be activated by means of hydrogenation (prehydrogenation) prior to the addition of the substrate. It has been found that without this pretreatment of the catalysts according to the invention the same or an even higher enantioselectivity is achieved.<br>
Examples of suitable catalyst precursors are (COD = 1,5 cyclooctadiene; nbd = norbornadiene; L = ligand I; S = a ligand as defined below): [Rh(COD)2CI]2, [Rh(COD)2)]BF4, [Rh(nbd)2]BF4, [Rh(nbd)2]CI04, [Ru(C0D)Cl2]n, RhCb.nHzO, Ru(0Ac)3, RuCl3.nH20. Examples of preformed complexes are RhL2(CH30H)2BF4, Rh(COD)L2BF4, RuL2(OAc)2, RuL2Br2, Ru(methylallyl)2L2, Ru(eta-6-benzene)L2Br2, Ru(eta-5"Cyclopentadienyl)L2CI,<br><br>
RuLaCb, RuLSCb, Ru (1,2-diphenyl-1,2-diaminoethane)LCl2.<br>
In the chiral ligand L of formula (I) Cn and/or R1 and/or R2 are chiral or are part of a chiral entity. Cn preferably represents a chiral substituted C4 chain (chain with 4 optionally substituted C-atoms), of predominantly one configuration, for example with an enantiomeric excess larger than 95%, in particular larger than 99%, more in particular larger than 99.5%. Preferably Cn together with the two 0-atoms and the P-atom forms a 7-membered ring with 4 C-atoms which 2 by 2 form part of an aryl group or a naphthyl group. Examples of suitable chiral ligands according to the invention are<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It will be understood that where one enantiomer is represented, the other enantiomer is similarly applicable.<br>
Such ligands with formula (I) can simply be prepared as described for example in Houben-Weyl Methoden der Organischen Chemie Band XII/2, Organische phosphorverblndungen. G. Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1964, Teil 2 (4th ed.), pp. 99-105. A preferred preparation method is based on the reaction of an HO-Cn-OH compound with P(NMe2)3 or P(NEt2)3(Me = methyl, Et = ethyl), with subsequent reaction with R1R2NH, preferably in a solvent having a boiling point &gt; 80 °C, for example toluene. Examples of suitable catalysts for the latter reaction are ammonium chloride, tetrazole or benzimidazoliumtriflate. Examples of HO-Cn-OH are chiral bisnaphtols for example (R)- or (S)- 1,1'-bi-<br><br>
(2-naphthol), chiral bisphenols for example {Ry or (S)- 6,6'-dimethoxy-2,2'-bisphenol, diols, for example {R,R)- or (S,S)-2,2-climethyl-1,3-dioxolane- 4,5-bis-(1,1-diphenyl)methanol (TADDOL), or (S,R) or (f?,S)-indane-1,2-diol; 1,2-diols and 1,3-diols based on sugars, for example diols having the formula:<br><br>
Examples of R^R^NH are benzyl amine, dibenzyl amine, diisopropyl amine, {Ry or (S)-1-methyl-benzyl amine, piperidine, morpholine, {R,Ry or (S,S)-bis-(1-methylbenzyl)amine.<br>
A second preferred preparation is based on the reaction of an HO-Cn-OH compound with PCI3, with subsequent reaction with R1R2NH, preferably in the presence of a base, for example EtaN, and in the presence of a solvent, for example toluene.

PFe, CIO4, p-toluene sulphonate, benzene phosphonate, tetra-pentafluorophenylborate. Non-coordinating anions are prefen'ed. If the catalyst is anionic, X is a cation. Examples of suitable cations are alkaline metals, for example Li, Na or K, alkaline earth metals such as Mg or Ca, or ammonium, or alkyl-substituted ammonium.<br>
Ligand S may be chiral or non chiral. Suitable ligands S are olefins, for example maleic anhydride or ethylene; dienes, for example 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 1,3-butadiene and 2,5-norbomadiene; aromatics, for example benzene, hexamethyl benzene, cymene and cumene, eta-5 coordinated cyclopentadienyl ligands, for example cyclopentadienyl and pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl, diamines such as 1,2-diaminoethane.

propanediamine.<br>
The invention also relates to the preparation of the chiral ligands of formula I. In addition, the invention relates to the use of a catalyst represented by the formula MLaXbSc, where M is a transition metal, to be chosen from rhodium, iridium and ruthenium, and X is a counter ion and S is a ligand, a ranges from 0.5 to 3 and b and c, each independently, range from 0 to 2, wherein L is a chiral ligand of formula (I)<br><br>

In the preparation of the catalyst preferably a molar ratio of metal to the optically active ligand of between 2:1 and 1:10, preferably between 1:1 and 1:6, is chosen. Preferably the catalyst is prepared in situ, which means in the same pot as wherein the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation reaction is performed, without intermediate isolation of the catalyst.<br>

A recent survey of the scope of asymmetric olefin hydrogenations is given, for example, by J.M. Brown in Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis, E.N. Jacobsen, A. Pfaltz and H. Yamamoto, eds. Springer, Berlin, 1999, Vol I, pp, 121-182.<br>

Other prochiral compounds that can be used in the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation reaction are prochiral imines having the general formula (III): <br>
where R, R' and R" for example each independently from one another represent an alkyl group, aryl group, aralkyi group, alkenyl group, oralkynyl group with 1-20 C-atoms or form a ring together with the atoms to which they are bound, it being also possible for R , R' and R" to contain one or more heteroatoms and functional groups, and R" furthermore may be a group that can be split off, for example a phosphinyl, sulphonyl or benzyl group. Examples of imines are those prepared from the ketones described above and an alkyl amine or aryl amine or an amino acid derivative, for example an amino acid amide, an amino acid ester, a peptide or a polypeptide. Examples of a suitable alkyl amine or aryl amine are a benzyl amine, for example benzyl amine, or an o-, m- or p-substituted benzyl amine, an a-alkyi benzyl amine, a naphthyl amine, for example naphthyl amine, a 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8- substituted naphthyl amine, a 1-(1-naphthyl)alkyl amine or a 1-(2-naphthyl)alkyl amine or a benzhydryl amine. Examples of suitable imines are<br><br>

Other prochiral compounds that can be used in the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation reaction are prochiral oximes and derivatives thereof having the general formula (IV):<br><br>
where R and R' are as defined above, R'" for example, represents an OH-group, an ether group, an acyloxy group, a sulphonyloxy group. Examples of suitable oxime derivatives are acetophenone oxime, N-acetoxy-p-methoxyacetophenone-imine and O-methyl-p-chloroacetophenone oxime.<br>
The catalysts according to the invention can also suitably be used in the preparation of an optically active compound, starting from a (racemic mixture of the enantiomers of an) olefin, ketone, imine or oxime derivate that contains a chiral centre elsewhere in the molecule and with preferably one of the two enantiomers being hydrogenated.<br>
The use of the catalysts according to the invention takes place in the presence of one or more hydrogen donors, which in the context of this invention are understood to be compounds that can in some way transfer hydrogen to the substrate. Suitable hydrogen donors that can be used are preferably H2, but may also be aliphatic or aromatic alcohols with 1-10 C-atoms, in particular secondary alcohols with 1-10 C-atoms, for example isopropanol or cyciohexanol, or unsaturated hydrocarbons with 5-10 C-atoms, for example 1,4 dihydrobenzene or hydroquinone, reducing sugars, for example glucose or derivates of formic acid, for example ammonium formate or an azeotropic mixture of formic acid and triethylamine.<br>
The molar ratio of substrate to hydrogen donor preferably lies between 1:1 and 1:100. The hydrogen pressure may vary within wide limits and is preferably chosen to be as high as possible when a fast reaction or the lowest possible amount of catalyst is desired. The hydrogen pressure for example lies<br><br>
between 0.05 and 20 MPa, preferably between 0.1 and 10 MPa, in particular between 0.15 and 8 MPa.<br>
In the asymmetric hydrogenation use is preferably made of a molar ratio of metal present in the transition metal compound to substrate of between 1:10 and 1:1,000,000, in particular between 1:50 and 1:100,000.<br>
The catalyst may optionally be added in dimeric form, with the dimeric form subsequently wholly or partly changing in situ into the monomeric<br>
form.<br>
The temperature at which the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation is carried out is generally a compromise between reaction velocity and enantioseiectivity, and preferably lies between -20 and 120°C, in particular between 0 and 60°C. The asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation is preferably carried out with oxygen being excluded. Preferably the substrates and solvents do not contain any oxygen, peroxides or other oxidizing substances.<br>
As solvent use can be made of: alcohols, esters, amides, ethers, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons. Preferably use is made of ethyl acetate, 2-propanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane, toluene or dibromoethane. It is also possible to carry out the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation in ionic liquids as described in T. Welton, Chem. Rev., 99, 2071-2083 (1999), so that isolation of the product is simplified. If necessary the solubility of the ligand in the ionic liquid can be increased by providing the ligand with polar groups such as carboxylate salts. If the substrate is a liquid, the hydrogenation can also very suitably be carried out without a solvent. If the substrate and/or the product hardly dissolves in the solvent the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation can also be performed as a slurry. If the product forms a slurry, its isolation is very much simplified.<br>
Preferably the (transfer) hydrogenation reaction is carried out without preceding prehydrogenation. However, it is also possible to activate the catalyst for the asymmetric (transfer) hydrogenation prior to the addition of the substrate by hydrogenation with hydrogen or by treatment with a reducing agent, for example NaBH4. The (transfer) hydrogenation reaction will sometimes also be accelerated by adding a base, an acid, a halide, or an N-hydroxyimide prior to or during the hydrogenation. Suitable bases are nitrogen bases for instance triethylamine, DBU, and substituted or non-substituted pyridines and mineral bases for example KOtBu or CS2CO3. Suitable acids are for example HBr, trifluoroacetic<br><br>
acid. Suitable halides are for example alkali halides or tetraalkylamonium halides e.g. Lil, LiBr, LiCI, Nal, tetrabutylammonium iodide. A suitable N-hydroxy-imide is for instance N-hydroxy-phtalic-imide.<br>
The invention will be elucidated with reference to the following examples, without however being restricted by these:<br>

Example IV: Hvdroqenation of olefins<br>
Method A. Hvdrogenation at 0.1 MPa with prehydroqenation<br>
Rh(COD)2BF4 (0.010 mmol) and chiral ligand (0.022 mmol) were weighed into a 10 ml Schlenk vessel, a magnetic stirring bar was added and the vessel was closed with a rubber septum. 3 Vacuum/nitrogen cycles were followed by 2 vacuum/hydrogen cycles. 1.5 mL of solvent is added and stirring under a hydrogen atmosphere of 0,1 MPa takes place for 1 hour. Subsequently a solution of substrate (0.2 mmol) in 3.5 ml solvent is added and the reaction mixture is stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere. Samples were filtered over silica gel with EtOAc : hexane 4:1 and evaporated. The e.e. was determined by chiral GC or HPLC, the conversion by ^H-NMR. When the reaction was finished the reaction mixture was treated and evaporated, in the same way as the samples. Results are depicted in the Tables.<br>
Method B. Hvdroqenation experiment at 0.1 MPa (without prehvdrogenation)<br>
Rh(COD)2BF4 (0.010 mmol), chiral ligand (0.022 mmol) and substrate (0.2 mmol) were weighed into a Schlenk tube equipped with a rubber septum cap and a stirring bar. After three vacuum/nitrogen cycles 5 mL of freshly distilled solvent is added through the septum cap and the reaction mixture is stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere of 0.1 MPa. Samples and reaction mixture were treated as described in method A. Results are depicted in the Tables.<br>
Method C. Hvdrogenation at 0.5 MPa<br>
Rh(COD)2BF4, chiral ligand (2.2. molequivalents in respect to Rh), and CH2CI2 (10 mL) were added into a Schlenk vessel and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere. The catalyst solution was transferred to a 50 mL Buchi miniclave by using a syringe. When solvents other than CH2CI2 were applied in the hydrogenation, Rh(COD)2BF4 and chiral ligand were first dissolved in CH2CI2 by stirring at RT under a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 minutes, CH2CI2 was evaporated under vacuum, the desired solvent (10 mL) was added and subsequently this catalyst solution was transferred to the Buchi miniclave.<br>
In a number of cases this solution was prehydrogenated for 1 hour under a hydrogen atmosphere of O.IMPa. The substrate (0.8 mmol)<br><br>
dissolved in 10 mL solvent was added to the Buchi minidave and a hydrogen pressure of 0.5 MPa was applied. Samples and reaction mixture were treated as described in method A. Results are depicted in the Tables.<br>
Method D. Hvdroaenation at 6 MPa<br>
Rh(nbd)2BF4 (4.0 mg, 0.0099 mmol) and 8.6 mg of chiral ligand 1 (0.022 mmol) were dissolved under a nitrogen atmosphere in CH2CI2 (2.5 mL, degassed) in a Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer and septum cap. The orange solution was stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature, and the solvent was removed by evaporation. The catalyst was dissolved in of EtOAc (20 mL, degassed). a-Acetamidocinnamic acid ester (240 mg, 1.09 mmol) was added to a 125 ml Parr autoclave. After three nitrogen pressure (0.29 MPa) -pressure release cycles EtOAc (30 ml) was added. The orange catalyst solution (20 ml) was added to the autoclave by using a syringe and a hydrogen pressure of 6.0 MPa was applied. The reaction mixture was stirred at 680 rpm using an overhead stirrer with a propeller stirring blade. Samples were taken after 4, 10 and 20 minutes. The reaction proved to be completed after 4 minutes. The conversion to N-acetyl-phenylalanine methyl ester was &gt; 99% with an e.e. of 97%. See also Table 2.<br>
Method E. Hydrogenation of different olefins and enamides at different Hydrogen pressures<br>
Rh(COD)2BF4, chiral ligand (2.2 molequivalent to Rh), substrate, and solvent were weighed into an autoclave. The autoclave was closed and inertised by three nitrogen pressure (0.29 MPa) - pressure release cycles. The desired hydrogen pressure was applied and the reaction mixture was stirred at 500 rpm using an overhead stirrer with a propeller stirring blade. The reactions were monitored by hydrogen uptake. Results are depicted in Table 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
