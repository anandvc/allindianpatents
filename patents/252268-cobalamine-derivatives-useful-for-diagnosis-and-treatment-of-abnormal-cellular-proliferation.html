				<td>Cobalamine derivatives useful for diagnosis and treatment of abnormal cellular proliferation<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to methods for imaging and destroying rapidly proliferating undesirable cells in multicellular organisms.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Abnormal cellular proliferation, notably hyperproliferation, is the source of numerous diseases, the most severe one being cancer. In the United States alone approximately 1.5 million people are diagnosed with cancer and 0.5 million die from it each year. The fight against cancer has seen some success but also numerous set-backs. Severe side-effects of anti-cancer drugs and the development of resistant off-spring of cancerous cells are major problems, as is the early and precise localization of tumours and metastasis.<br>
Hyperproliferative cells, such as many cancerous cells, depend on an increased supply of nutrients, growth factors, energy and vitamins. Using the supply route of a vitamin, which is essential for cellular growth and is often in short supply, one might possibly transport .drugs to these unwanted cells.<br>
Cobalamin (Cbl), also known as Vitamin B12 and present as cyano-cobalamin (CN-Cbl), hydroxy-cobalamin (HO-Cbl) or aquo-cobalamin (H20-Cbl), is essential for life and its concentration in the body is very low. Higher organisms including humans have to get the vitamin from their food. The biosynthesis of cobalamin is limited to some prokaryotic organisms, such as anaerobic bacteria. Cobalamin is important for the proper function of the nervous system and is necessary for the proper metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fat. Cobalamin is utilized in essential intracellular metabolic pathways. As methyl-cobalamin (Me-Cbl), it functions as a cof actor for methionine synthase. As 5'-deoxyadenosyl-cobalamin (Ado-Cbl), it functions with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in the rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. A cobalamin deficiency can result in pernicious anemia. Cobalamin is also involved in the reductive conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides to generate DNA.<br>
In mammals, most of the cellular uptake of cobalamin is regulated by serum transport proteins and by cell membrane receptors. There are two types of cobalamin-binding proteins in plasma: the non-glycosylated protein transcobalamin II (TCI!) and the glycosylated proteins transcobalamin I and III (TCI and TCIII), also called R-binder proteins or haptocorrins, TCI and TCIII are immunologically cross-reactive and probably differ only in their carbohydrate composition. TCI is the primary R-binder found in circulation. For simplicity reasons the term TCI will be used when referring to both R-binder proteins TCI and TCIII. Both types of transport proteins (vectors) TCI and TCII circulate in mammalian blood either partly saturated (holo), or partly unsaturated (apo) with cobalamin. A vector-less uptake system for cobalamin with a rather low efficiency in normal cells is also present in mammalian cells (see Sennet, C. and Rosenberg, L.E., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 50, 1053-86(1981)).<br>
TCII functions in the delivery of plasma cobalamin to all metabolically active cells by receptor mediated endocytosis. It is well known that accelerated cellular proliferation in neoplasia primarily entails increased consumption of cobalamin loaded TCII from circulation by receptor mediated endocytotic uptake. Upregulation in the number of TCII receptors has been widely demonstrated in malignant cell lines to meet the increased metabolic demand of thymidine and methionine production, methylation reactions for DMA synthesis and cellular energetics via mitochondria! metabolism.<br>
The general TCII receptor is present in all tissues while a second and more organ-specific TCII receptor, called megalin, is heavily expressed in kidney proximal tubules and several other absorptive epithelia. After endocytotic internalisation, TCII is degraded in the lysosomes and free cobalamin is transported to the cytoplasm and inside the nuclear membrane, where it is converted into Me-Cbl and Ado-Cbl. These two forms are operating as the active coenzymes of vitamin B12. The essential role of TCII is well established by the observation that inherited inborn lack of TCII leads to megaloblastic anemia, detrimental neurological disorders and death if not treated with excess cobalamin.<br>
Almost all cells are able to generate TCII. Many cells such as hepatocytes, fibroblasts, nervous cells, enterocytes and macrophages synthesize elevated amounts of TCII. It is assumed that the vascular endothelium is the primary source of TCII. Approximately 20-30% of the circulating cobalamin is bound to TCII as holo-TCII. This is the metabolically efficient form that ensures the internalisation of cobalamin in all tissues (see Rothenberg,<br>
E. etal., in: Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12, ed. R. Banerjee, New York, NY, 1999, pp. 441-473).<br>
TCI is present in blood and plasma as well as in most exocrine secretions and other fluids. It is mainly generated in the foregut tissues, gastric mucosa, salivary and lacrimal glands and secretory epithelium of the inner ear. TCI, unlike TCII, does not seem to deliver its cobalamin primarily for cellular uptake, has a long half-life in the blood, and thus holds more than 75% of circulating cobalamin (and corrin) at any given moment. Almost all TCI circulates as holo-TCI. Its role is not fully understood. It has been proposed to function as a bacteriostatic agent by preventing the supply of all sorts of cobalamins and corrins to microorganisms. It may also stabilise adenosylrcobalamin and protect if from photolysis. In contrast to TCI, which has a higher concentration than TCII in circulation, the level of TCII can be elevated very quickly by de novo synthesis of apo-TCII in response to incoming cobalamin. TCI is generated rather slowly and can not be stimulated substantially in response to any triggering impact (see Alpers, D. and Russell, G., in: Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12, supra, pp. 411-441).<br>
Until now, the vector-less uptake of cobalamin in mammalian cells has not been considered as an alternative route to supply cobalamin derivatives to hyperproliferative cells. It is undisputed that the physiologically important mechanisms for the uptake of cobalamin by benign mammalian cells requires the vectors TCII and TCI (and intrinsic factor in the digestive tract). However, in vivo and in vitro data show that free cobalamin is also able to traverse the plasma membrane without the involvement of a vector protein. Direct evidence for an additional ability to take up free cobalamin comes from the study of children congenially and totally deficient in TCII, in whom parerrteral administration of free cobalamin resulted in a striking remission of clinical and chemical signs of intracellular cobalamin deficiency (see Hall, C.E. et at., Blood, 53,251-263 (1979)). In vitro studies showed uptake of free cobalamin in HeLa cells and fibroblasts. In HeLa cells, uptake of free cobalamin is between 1% and 2% of that seen for TCII-bound cobalamin. With human fibroblasts, free cobalamin accumulation in a two-hour interval amounts to about 20% of that noted with TCII-bound vitamin. The free vitamin uptake system in human fibroblasts has been studied in some detail by Berliner and Rosenberg (Berliner, N. and Rosenberg, L.E., Metabolism, 30, 230-236 (1981)). Uptake of free CN-^CoJ-Cbl has been established as a biphasic system: The initial uptake component is rapid, saturable and specifically inhibited by excess unlabelled CN-Cfal and OH-Cbl, and complete within 30 min. The second uptake component is slower, linear with time and not inhibited by<br>
excess unlabelled cobalamin, and does not plateau even after 8 h, suggesting the characteristic attributes of a non-specific process. The initial mode of uptake has properties of a protein mediated highly specific membrane traversation; it is sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents and markedly inhibited by cycloheximide (Sennet, C. and Rosenberg, LE., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 50,1053-86 (1981)). These properties are consistent with the presence of a protein-mediated, facilitated uptake system of free cobalamin in mammals.<br>
It is well established that many bacteria and all eucaryotic protists are auxotrophic for vitamin B12 and able to bind it with higher affinity than mammalian intrinsic factor, TCI and TCII. Bacterial and protozoan 612-binding proteins are vector-less operating cell surface proteins able to bind a wide variety of corrins (including true cobalamin) with high avidity. Therefore, the detection of bacterial infections in the context of a whole body image, following the application of a radio-labelled cobalamin derivative, was no surprise (Collins, D.A. et ai, Mayo Clin. Proc. 15, 568-580 (2000)). The development of hyperproliferative forms of mammalian cells may well entail the development by multistep cancerogenesis of more efficient forms of the already present vector-less cobalamin uptake system.<br>
Approaches have been published and patented to use cobalamin as carrier for a broad variety of biologically active agents, including radioactive metal isotopes (see Collins, D.A., US Pat. Appl. No. 2003/0144198). The results obtained in animals and humans, when using radio-labelled cobalamin derivatives, showed labelling of tumour tissues, but also a strong accumulation of radioactivity in healthy tissues, such as kidney and liver. Therefore, imaging and radiotherapy are far from being optimal. The potential for major damages to some healthy parts of the body limits the applications described so far.<br>
There is an obvious need for compounds, compositions and methods to administer diagnostic and therapeutic cobalamin derivatives to rapidly proliferating cells in higher concentrations compared to normal cells. It is the objective of the present invention to provide new methods to identify, synthesise, characterise and apply cobalamin derivatives with higher specificity for cells with abnormally high proliferation, while avoiding the development of resistant cellular off-spring.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention is based on the observation that, in contrast to cobalamin itself, cobalamin derivatives with no or much reduced binding to the transport protein<br>
transcobalamin II (TCII), if properly applied, have a much reduced accumulation rate in blood and benign organs, such as kidney and liver, compared to the accumulation rate in neoplastic tissues, and are more rapidly eliminated from blood. By selecting cobalamin derivatives acting as vitamin B12 substitutes, the risk of the formation of resistant off­spring in neoplastic tissue is much reduced.<br>
The invention relates to cobalamin derivatives<br>
having no binding affinity or low binding affinity to transcobalamin II and<br>
retaining activity as a vitamin B12 substitute.<br>
In particular the invention relates to cobalamin derivatives<br>
having less than 20%, preferably less than 5%, of binding affinity to transcobalamin II<br>
when compared to the binding affinity of non-modified cobalamin in a binding test, and<br>
retaining more than 2% of the activity as a vitamin B12 substitute in a growth assay.<br>
Examples of compounds of the invention with low or no binding affinity for TCII are specific cobalamin derivatives carrying a therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent, such as a radioactive metal. The compounds of the invention are selected on the basis of the results of a binding test with purified TCII and a growth assay using Lactobacillus delbrueckiias the test organism.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of diagnosis of a neoplastic disease or an infection by microorganisms in a mammal comprising<br>
exposing the mammal suspected of being inflicted by a neoplastic disease or an<br>
infection to a period of a vitamin B12 - free diet, and<br>
subsequently applying a cobalamin derivative of the invention carrying a diagnostic<br>
agent.<br>
The invention likewise relates to a method of treatment of a mammal suffering from a neoplastic disease or an infection by microorganisms comprising<br>
exposing the mammal in need of treatment to a period of a vitamin B12 - free diet, and<br>
subsequently applying a cobalamin derivative of the invention carrying a therapeutic<br>
agent.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a cobalamin derivative according to the invention in a method of diagnosis of a neoplastic disease or an infection by microorganisms or in a<br>
method of treatment of a mammal suffering from a neoplastic disease or an infection by microorganisms.<br>
The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising cobalamin derivatives of the invention, in particular pharmaceutical compositions suitable for diagnostic applications and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for therapeutic applications, and to the use of such pharmaceutical compositions in a method of diagnosis and in a method of therapeutic treatment, respectively.<br>
The invention also relates to intermediates for the preparation of compounds useful in a diagnostic or therapeutic treatment according the invention, in particular to compounds substituted with chelators for binding radioactive metals, but having no metal or a non-radioactive metal bound to the chelator.<br>
Cobalamin derivatives according to the invention are of particularly high value for the diagnosis and/or the treatment of aggressive, rapidly progressing neoplastic diseases such as cancers and/or diagnosis and/or treatment of local infections by pathogenic microorganisms.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Cobalamin derivatives with no or very low binding affinity to the cobalamin vector protein (or transport protein) TCII, when applied to mammals exposed to vitamin B12 diet, exhibit a much reduced accumulation in blood and in crucial organs, such as kidney and liver, while maintaining high uptake rates in hyperproliferative cells and, thus, enabling more precise diagnosis and therapy of neoplastic diseases and of local infections by microorganisms.<br>

hydroxy or aquo; or<br>
a 5'-deoxyadenosyl group or a related nucleoside.<br>
Preferably, X is cyano, methyl, hydroxy, aquo or a 5'-deoxyadenosyl group. Most preferred is cyano.<br>
A spacer-chelator group as a substituent Rb, Rc, Rd, Re or RR is a chelator for metal atoms attached to the NH or O function of the cobalamin via a spacer, and optionally carries a metal atom, in particular a radioactive metal atom.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) in which the spacer-chelator group does not carry a metal atom are intermediates to be used in the manufacture of compounds useful in a method of diagnostic and/or therapeutic treatment according to the invention.<br>
An antibiotic or an antiproliferative therapeutic agent as a substituent Rb, Rc, Rd, Re or RR is a an antibiotic agent selected from aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gerrtamycin, tetracyclins, antimetabolites, such as selenomethionin, macrolides, such as erythromycin, and trimethoprim, or an antiproliferative agent selected from antimetabolites, such as 5-fluorouracil, alkylating agent, such as oxaliplatin, dacarbazin, cyclophosphamide or carboplatin, a cell-cycle inhibitor, such as vinblastine or docetaxel, a DNA breaker (topo-<br>

A spacer is an aliphatic chain of 2 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 6 carbon atoms, e.g. 2 to 5 carbon atoms, wherein one or two carbon atoms may be replaced by nitrogen and/or oxygen atoms and the aliphatic chain may be substituted by hydroxy, oxo or amino. In particular two adjacent carbon atoms may be replaced by an amide function -NH-CO- or an ester function -O-CO-.<br>
Particular spacers connecting the NH or O function of the cobalamin with a chelator are ethylene, propylene, butylene or pentylene groups or such groups wherein one carbon is replaced by oxygen or nitrogen, or wherein one carbon atom is replaced by oxygen or nitrogen and the adjacent carbon atom is substituted by oxo.<br>
A chelator is a compound having two, three or more donor atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur in a distance such as to bind to a metal atom. Particular chelators are tridentate chelators having three metal binding sites comprising N, O and/or S donor atoms in a distance from each other allowing binding of metal atoms. Nitrogen atoms as donor atoms are e.g. part of an aliphatic amine, an aromatic amine or a nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocycle. Oxygen atoms as donor atoms are e.g. alcohols, ethers, esters or carboxy functions. Sulfur atoms as donor atoms are e.g. thioethers or thiols. The donors may be connected e.g. by aliphatic carbon chains or chains comprising amide bonds and/or ether functions, and may be amino acid derivatives, polyethers, and the like.<br>
Preferred chelators are the chelators of formula (II) to (IX). Carboxyl groups may be present as esters which cleave concomitantly with complex formation with a metal atom to yield a coordinating carboxylate group. In such esterified chelators, the ester may be an alkyl ester wherein alkyl is linear or branched and comprises 1 to 25 carbon atoms, optionally one to five carbon atoms being replaced by nitrogen or oxygen, or one or two carbon atoms replaced by sulfur or phosphorus, and which are optionally substituted by phenyl, pyridyl, hydroxy, halogen, cyano, oxo or amino. The ester may also be an aryl or heteroaryl ester wherein aryl or heteroaryl has 3 to 10 carbon atoms and zero, one or two<br>
oxygen, zero, one, two or three nitrogen or zero or one sulfur atoms. Such ester residues may be suitably substituted in order to make them cleavable under particular reaction conditions, e.g. as described for esters commonly used as protecting groups for carboxylic acids, see Green, T.W., and Wuts, P.G.M., Protective groups in organic synthesis, Wiley 1999.<br>
Esterified chelators, e.g. esterified by methyl, ethyl or cyanoethyl, are also comprised in the definition of preferred chelators.<br>
(Figure removed) Radioactive metals considered are radioisotopes such as ^Tc, "Tc, 188Re, 186Re, I11ln, "V, "Cu, ^Cu and 177Lu, in particular ""Tc, 188Re, 186Re and 111ln.<br>
Radioactive isotopes of Co considered are e.g. 57Co and '"Co.<br>
A sterically demanding organic group with 4 to 20 carbon atoms is e.g. an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl or heteroarylalkyl group optionally substituted by hydroxy, alkoxy, oxo, amino, carboxy, carbamoyl or alkoxycarbonyl. Examples of aryl groups are phenyl, methylphenyl, dimethylphenyl, hydroxyphenyl or naphthyl. Examples of heteroaryl groups are pyridyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl or benzimidazolyl. In an alkyl chain, carbon atoms may be replaced by nitrogen or oxygen atoms. For example, in an alkyl chain, one carbon atom may be replaced by a nitrogen (or oxygen) atom, and the neighbouring carbon atom be substituted by oxo, thereby representing a carboxamide (or ester function, respectively). Particular examples of a sterically demanding organic group are iso-butyl, tert-butyl, tert-pentyl, o-tolyl, o-methylbenzyl, or 2,6-dimethylbenzyl.<br>
A linker 7. connecting RR with a spacer-chelator group or an antibiotic or antiproliferative therapeutic agent is a bond or a linker selected from the group of phosphates, phosphonates, carboxylic esters or alkylene of 1 to 10 carbon atoms and combinations thereof. Such a linker connects the spacer-chelator group or the therapeutic agent optionally comprising a spacer as defined hereinbefore to the oxygen atom of cobalamin.<br>
Compounds that are derivatized at RR but wherein Rb, Rc, Rd and Re are all hydrogen are recognized by the TC's and are still enzymatically active, and therefore excluded from the scope of the invention.<br>
The selection of a compound of the invention is based on the following criteria:<br>
(a)	No or very much reduced binding affinity, e.g. less than 20%, in particular less than<br>
10%, preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 2% binding affinity, to TCII when compared with the binding of (non-modified) cobalamin; and<br>
(b)	activity as a vitamin B12 substitute in a growth test using a vitamin B12 dependent<br>
bacterium or mamrnalian cell line, e.g. more than 2% activity, in particular more than 10%<br>
activity, preferably more than 20% activity when compared to the vitamin B12 activity of<br>
(non-modified) cobalamin.<br>
To test the binding affinity of cobalamin (Gbl) derivatives to TCII, an in w'irotest is carried out with partially purified TCII obtained from the blood of rabbits. Recombinant TCII produced with an £ co//expression system can also be used as a substrate.<br>
Cobalamin derivatives of the invention have to maintain their function as vitamin B12 substitutes. As a result, the risk of resistance development leading to cells with high<br>
proliferation rates will be very much reduced. With all likelihood, mutant cells which are no longer able to take up cobalamin derivatives with low or no binding activity to TCI I will have lost the advantage of their predecessor cells to achieve high proliferation rates thanks to a highly efficient TCII independent vitamin B12 uptake mechanism.<br>
To test for vitamin B12 activity of a cobalamin derivative an assay is carried out by using Lactobacillus detbrueckillan internationally recommended test strain for cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl). Supplementation of cyanocobalamin to a cyanocobalamin-free assay medium results in a growth response of the cyanocobalamin-auxotrophic bacterial strain which can be measured by a quantitative solid diffusion plate assay. The test is used to determine to what extent (in %) the cobalamin derivative is able to replace cyanocobalamin as a life supporting catalyst.<br>
The invention relates to a method of diagnosis and a method of treatment of neoplastic diseases and of local infections by microorganisms in a mammal comprising<br>
exposing the mammal to a period of a vitamin B12 - free diet<br>
subsequently applying a cobalamin derivative of the invention carrying a diagnostic or<br>
a therapeutic agent,<br>
and to the use of the cobalamin derivatives of the invention in such a method.<br>
The positive effect of applying TCII non-binding cyanocobalamin derivatives on their biodistribution in mammals exposed to a vitamin-free diet is illustrated in Table 1<br>
(Table removed).<br>
Example 6: Cyanocobalamin-/&gt;butyl-aminocarboxymethyl-His-OMe<br>
Example 8: Qyanocobalamin-o-butyl-PAPAcet<br>
Example 10 : Cyanocobalamin-bethyl-PAMA-OEt Example 11 : Cyanocobalamin-b-propyl-PAMA-OEt Example 12 : Cyanocobalamin-b-butyl-PAMA-OEt Example 14 : Cyanocobalamin-b-hexyl-PAMA-OEt Example 18 : Cyanocobalamin-d-propyl-PAMA-OEt Example 20 : Cyanocobalamin-bpropyl-His-OMe Example 22 : Cyanocobalamin-b-ethyl-Triamine Example 25 : Cyanocobalamin-5'-phosphocolamin-His-OMe<br>
The results of biodistribution analysis collected in Table 1 indicate that TCII non-binders, e.g. the compounds of the invention as described in Examples 10,11,12,18 and 22, have a comparatively high accumulation in tumor, five times or more than in blood and at least half the amount found in the critical organs kidney and liver. The compounds of the Examples 5, 6, 8,14, 20 and 25 do not fall under the definition of compounds of the invention since they bind to TCII, and are described here only as reference compounds.<br>
Cobalamin derivatives according to the invention are of particularly high value for the diagnosis and/or the treatment of aggressive, rapidly progressing neoplastic diseases such as cancers. Compounds of the invention can be used for the treatment of highly proliferative cells of human origin involved in malignancies such as melanoma, fibrosarcoma, ovarial carcinoma, pancreas carcinoma, osteosarcoma and acute leukaemia, to mention just a few examples, and are able to bypass TCII mediated endocytosis. The method of the invention allows a specific protection of benign organs from TCII mediated detrimental uptake of cobalamin derivatives carrying a radioactive isotope or/and carrying a non-radioactive agent destroying cells.<br>
Compounds of the invention are not only useful in cancer imaging and cancer therapy, but also for the visualization and the potential treatment of local infections by microorganisms depending on a high and direct uptake of cobalamins.<br>
Compounds of the invention carrying an antiproliferative agent are useful for transporting the agent in an inactive form in to the hyperproliferative cells where it can exert its action after intracellular amidolysis.<br>
In a method of treatment of a neoplastic and/or infectious disease, a compound of the invention carrying a suitable therapeutic agent can be administered alone or in<br>
combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, possible combination therapy taking the form of fixed combinations, or the administration of a compound of the invention and one or more other therapeutic agents being staggered or given independently of one another, or the combined administration of fixed combinations and one or more other therapeutic agents. A compound of the invention can, besides or in addition, be administered especially for tumor therapy in combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgical intervention, or a combination of these. Long-term therapy is equally possible as is adjuvant therapy in the context of other treatment strategies.<br>
The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising cobalamin derivatives of the invention, in particular pharmaceutical compositions suitable for diagnostic applications and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for therapeutic applications.<br>
Preferred are pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration, such as intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. The compositions comprise the active ingredient alone or together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The dosage of the active ingredient depends upon the disease to be treated and upon the species, its age, weight, and individual condition, the individual pharmacokinetic data, and the mode of administration.<br>
Methods of manufacture<br>
Compounds of the invention are prepared by standard methods known in the art.<br>
Preferably, cyanocobalamin, i.e. the compound of formula (I) wherein Rb, Rc, Rd, Re and RR are hydrogen and X is cyano, is hydrolyzed under controlled conditions, e.g. with dilute mineral acid, and the obtained mixture of mono-acids, wherein one of the carbamoyl groups CONH2 is converted to COOH, separated. Bis-acids may be obtained similarly.<br>
Cyanocobalamin-fc, c, dor e-acid, i.e. the compound of formula (I) wherein GONHRb, CONHRC, CONHR" or CONHR6 is replaced by COOH, respectively, and X is cyano, may then be reacted with a corresponding amine Rb-NH2, Rc-NH2l Rd-NH2 and Re-NH2, respectively, under standard conditions for amide formation, e.g. as known in the chemistry of peptides. Functional groups in residues Rb, Rc, Rd and Re that interfere with<br>
amide formation are preferably in protected form, and are deprotected by standard methods after amide formation. For the preparation of compounds wherein the spacer comprises an amide function, it is also possible to react cyanocobalamin- b, c, dor e-acid with a diamine H2N(CH2)nNH2 under amide-forming standard conditions, and to further condense the H2N(CH2)n-functionalized cyanocobalamin obtained with a corresponding carboxylic acid again under amide-forming standard conditions to generate the substituent Rb, Rc, Rd and Re, respectively.<br>
For the preparation of compounds wherein Rc is different from hydrogen, the preferred method is formation of the olactone followed by a reductive lactone ring opening reaction according to Brown et al., Inorg. Chem. 1995, 3038.<br>
For the preparation of compounds wherein RR is different from hydrogen, cyanocobalamin (or a cyanocobalamin derivative wherein Rb, Rc, Rd or Re is different from hydrogen) is reacted with Rn-L wherein L is a suitable activating leaving group for forming an ester bond, e.g. halogen, the residue of a mixed anhydride or another of the usual activating residues for carboxylic, phosphate or phosphonate ester formation customary in peptide and nucleic acid synthesis.<br>

Under these conditions, ester protecting groups in the chelators were cleaved to give the carboxylato complexes.<br>
For in vivo studies and for binding studies to the transport vectors, very high specific activity was demanded. Therefore, 100 ul of the labeled solution were injected to an analytical HPLC system to separate the hot from the cold vitamin derivative. The eluate fraction with the highest gamma activity (ca. 300 MO was diluted with normal saline to a concentration of 10 p.Ci per animal before i.v. injection.

Bound TG II is eluted with 20 ml 4.0 M guanidine HCI / 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, and in a second step with 7.5 M guanidine HCI / 50 mM Tris pH 8.0. Most of the bound TC II elutes already with 4 M guanidine HCI.

The transcobalamin II protein contains a PreScission protease site followed by an N-terminal histidine tag. The protein is isolated from soluble fractions -<br>
of £ coli extracts using nickel chelating sepharose. Cyanocobalamin is removed from the transcobalamin II bound to the chelating column with 8 M urea, and the transcobalamin II is afterwards released by imidazole. In some of the preparations, the His-tag is removed by a specific protease.<br>
Example 30: Preparation of transcobalamin I (TC I: Haptocorrin) As a source of transcobalamin I, saliva of vegetarian human subjects is used. Saliva is centrifuged at 20'000 rpm 20 min at 4°C, mixed 1:1 with PBS and sterile filtered. The binding capacity of transcobalamin I is usually 10 ng/ml.<br>

The interaction of radiolabeled (57Co, 99mTc, 188Re, 111ln) cyanocobalamin derivatives is measured by gel-shift assay. Radiolabeled cyanocobalamin (0.05 ng to 1 ng) is allowed to react with an excess of transport proteins for 15 min at room temperature. This mixture is applied to a gel-filtration column (Superdex75, Amersham Biosciencies) in the running buffer PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. Biologically active cyanocobalamin, which binds to transport proteins, shifts from a molecular weight of about 1.4 kDa to 40 - 70 kDa, depending on the transport protein. Titration of the binding capacity of the transport proteins is done with 57Co-cyanocobalamin (ICN Biomedicals GmbH, Germany;! 0 nCi / 50 ng).<br>

The labeled cyanocobalamin is separated from the non-labeled on a reversed phase HPLC column (Waters Xterra RP8) in phosphate buffer with a linear methanol gradient. The active fraction is diluted with normal saline before i.v. injection to a concentration of 10Ci per animal for imaging purposes and up to 2 mCi for therapeutic treatments.<br>
Example 33: Sensitivity of tumor cell spheroids to ionizing radiation<br>
In radiobiology, the similarity of radiation response between spheroids and tumor<br>
xenograft bearing mice makes the spheroids to be a good alternative model to in vivo<br>
irradiation studies. Multicellular tumor spheroids are grown in spinner flasks with continuous stirring at 37'C to an average diameter of 400 urn. Spheroids are harvested, washed in fresh medium and then incubated for 1 h with cold or 188Re-labeled cyano-cobalamin derivatives in 24 well flat bottom tissue culture plates. The dose range is 1 n-Ci to 20 (o.Ci per well. Cytotoxicity is assessed by fluorescence viability markers, by measurements of the diameter of the whole spheroids and by a clonogenic assay of dispersed speroids in semi-solid agar.<br>
Example 34: Biodistribution of radiolabeled cvanocobalamin derivatives in mice (Fig. 3. 4. 5.6)<br>
For biodistribution studies with 57Co-cyanocobalamin, 0.2 p.Ci /1 ng of the radiolabeled cyanocobalamin is mixed with 180  normal saline and injected i.v. in tumor bearing balb/c mice (syngeneic mouse melanoma B16-F10). After a specified time (5 min to 24 h), animals are sacrificed, the organs weighted and counted on a gamma counter. For biodistribution studies with ""Tc-labeled cyanocobalamin, 10 u.Ci / 0.5 ng of the radiolabelled cyanocobalamin is mixed with normal saline and used as before. For biodistribution with 111ln-labeled cyanocobalamin, 2 uCi / 5 ng of the radiolabeled cyanocobalamin is mixed with normal saline and used as before. To study the effect of Vitamin B12 deficient food, the biodistribution of labeled cyanocobalamin is compared in mice fed with normal food with the biodistribution in mice fed with vitamin B12 deficient food for a period of 2 weeks.<br>
Example 35: Therapy studies with 188Re-labeled cvanocobalamin derivatives in tumor bearing mice<br>
For therapy studies, syngeneic melanoma tumor is grown in balb/c mice to a size of about 200 mg (measured by caliber). Increasing doses (0.1 to 2 mCi) of radiolabeled cyano­cobalamin constructs and of cold constructs are injected i.v. Tumor volume is assessed by measurement with a caliber. When the tumor reaches a size of 800 mg, animals are sacrificed. In a series of experiments animals are treated with a fractionated regiment: radiolabeled cyanocobalamin is given 3 times a week apart. Animals are observed for 60 days for re-growth of tumors.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
