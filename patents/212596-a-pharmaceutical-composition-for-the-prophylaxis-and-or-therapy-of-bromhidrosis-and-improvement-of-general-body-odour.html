				<td>The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the prophylaxis and/or<br>
therapy of bromhidrosis and improvement of general body odour, comprising botulinus<br>
toxins. The claimed compositions are synergestic in nature having unexpected and<br>
surprising properties.<br>
In cosmetics there are methods for generating a pleasant odour with foreign substances<br>
(perfumes); in medicine there are methods for the reduction of a pathological malodorant body<br>
odour (bromhidrosis). However, either of them is not distinct from the possibility to increase the<br>
quality rating or acceptability of the body"s odour.<br>
Body odour is a generally known and widespread phenomenon. It can occur in different<br>
individuals under comparable conditions in very different intensities and be perceived differently<br>
by the affected people themselves as well as by their fellow men.<br>
In contrary to the common idea the body sweat, i e. the secretion of the eccrine perspiratory<br>
glands, is totally odourless. Therefore excessive perspiration must not be confused with excessive<br>
body odour. In its composition sweat is a clear aqueous fluid consisting predominantly of sodium-<br>
potassium-, calcium-, magnesium- and chloride ions and besides that contains lactate, urea and<br>
traces of arnino acids, biogenic amines and vitamins. Under exceptional circumstances<br>
medicaments can be excreted via the sweat such as griseofulvin and ketokonazol but which does<br>
not play a significant role for the body odour. The more sweat is produced, for example under<br>
extreme conditions like in the sauna, the more the sweat is diluted, i.e. all the more aqueous the<br>
sweat becomes. An excessive unnatural production of sweat under normal physiological<br>
conditions is known as a disease pattern, the so-called hyperhidrosis. Therefore the excessive<br>
sweating (hyperhidrosis) is not the direct cause for body odour. On the contrary: it was explicitly<br>
emphasised in medical textbooks and publications that patients suffering from excessive underarm<br>
perspiration (Hyperhidrosis axillaris) typically do not deve1op a strong body odour [4]. This is<br>
explained by the fact that the odourless, in huge quantities outpouring sweat quasi "flushes away"<br>
the odour producing substances from the skin. However, in contrast to the eccrine perspiratory<br>
glands the so-called scent glands (apocrine and apo-eccrine glands) can release a discernible<br>
smelling secretion. This secretion can in turn be converted into malodorant substances on the<br>
surface of the skin by bacteria. The scent glands can therefore be assigned a causative role in the<br>
occurrence of the body odour. Scent glands can be found in great numbers e.g. in the human<br>
armpit, but they get active usually only after puberty. Accordingly, the body odour is usually<br>
much stronger in adults than in children.<br>
In a simplified way body odour can be caused by two essential factors:<br>
1.  The secretions produced by the scent glands show a characteristic odour being perceived by<br>
other people in very different extents.<br>
2.  The secretions of the scent glands, derivatives of steroids and other body substances like e.g.<br>
the grease of the skin, can be degraded by the microflora of the skin resulting in a series of<br>
products of decomposition. Such products of decomposition generated by bacteria can for<br>
example produce a penetrative or rancid odour. Certain amino acids can account for the body<br>
odour, too.<br>
Thus the body odour is in summary mostly a matter of the mixture of different components which<br>
are not yet totally analysed in their composition and which individually can be very different. For<br>
this reason, analyses concerned with the body odour, are not performed only by biochemical<br>
measurements but independent test persons are adopted who perform an assessment of the body<br>
odour by their olfactory organ and by this means indicate on scales how intensive or how<br>
unpleasant a certain odour is.<br>
In the case of an extremely strong and unpleasant occurrence, the body odour is defined as a<br>
disease named with the term "bromhidrosis". However, body odour can also be perceived in a<br>
wide range of perceptions between unpleasant, disgusting up to pleasant or even infatuating and<br>
stimulating. Thus, in behavioural psychology the effect of body odour is not judged only by the<br>
intensity (how strong does something smell) but also the emotional valence (how good or how<br>
bad does something smell).<br>
The measures known by now for obtaining a pleasant body odour consist basically in the use of<br>
perfumes, fragrants, substances and deodorants for covering the own body odour.<br>
Moreover therapies for the reduction of an unpleasant body odour are primarily aimed against<br>
bacteria of the skin and their activity in decomposition on the skin. Thus, in the case of<br>
bromhidrosis are recommended for example:<br>
•    frequent washing and changing of the underwear<br>
•    frequent application of soaps or syndets for rinsing of intensively smelling substances<br>
•     application of deodorants<br>
•    disinfectants or skin cleansers that reduce and destroy, respectively, the bacterial flora of the<br>
skin<br>
The disadvantage of the above mentioned measures is: the more intensively they are applied, the<br>
more they lead to an irritation of the skin and to a disturbance of the skin"s function as a barrier<br>
which may lead to unpleasant eczematoid reactions accompanied by redness and itching. In<br>
addition specially the fragrant substances in deodorants exhibit a high allergenic power abetting an<br>
immunological allergisation which may lead to livelong existing allergies.<br>
Although the suppression of the secretion of sweet e.g. by the use of metal-salt containing<br>
solutions such as aluminium chloride, is recommended in order to bring about a mechanical<br>
obstruction of the channels of the perspiratory glands thereby repressing the sweat flow.<br>
However, these and similar therapies lead also often to unwanted irritations of the skin.<br>
Furthermore they are not suited to affect the body odour directly taking the above mentioned<br>
odourless features of the sweat into account, but may at best accomplish an indirect change of the<br>
dermal environment.<br>
Thus, in summary all conventional measures disregard the importance of the scent glands and<br>
their manipulation for the improvement of the body odour.<br>
Therefore the problem of the invention consists in the provision of a medicament for the treatment<br>
of bromhidrosis and in the provision of a cosmetic means for the improvement of the body odour.<br>
The problem is solved by the subject-matter defined in the patent claims.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the accompanying figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows the assessment of the intensity of the body odour (0=no odour perceptible,<br>
6=maximally intensive odour) after one-sided treatment with botulinus toxin in a diagram.<br>
Control-treated armpits: n=16, median=2.88, SD=1.43. Botulinus toxin-A-treated armpits: n=16,<br>
median=1.75, SD=0.86. Significance of the difference (Wilcoxon-test): p=0.02. BTA means<br>
botulinus toxin-A.<br>
Figure 2 shows the assessment of the quality rating (valency) of the body odour (-3=extremely<br>
unpleasant; +3=extremely pleasant) after one-sided treatment with botulinus toxin in a diagram.<br>
Control-treated armpits: n=16, median=1. 13, SD=0.89. Botulinus toxin-A-treated armpits: n=16,<br>
median=0.5, SD=0.75. Significance of the difference (Wilcoxon-test): p=0.001. BTA means<br>
botulinus toxin-A.<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to the use of botulinus toxin for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for prophylaxis or therapy of bromhidrosis. A further aspect relates to the use of<br>
botulinus toxin for the preparation of a cosmetic agent for the improvement of the body odour.<br>
Therefore the present invention relates to a new method for the manipulation of the body odour<br>
e.g. in terms of a reduction (less intensive and improvement (sensed as more pleasant) of the<br>
body odour. Thereby it is not about a mere reduction of the secretion of sweat since sweat is an<br>
odourless fluid but it is about a change in the features of the smell of the armpit or other areas of<br>
the skin which generate a perceptible and unpleasant odour.<br>
Botulinus toxins are a group of highly potent bacterial toxins being produced by Clostridium<br>
botidinum under unaerobic conditions. The subtype botulinum toxin-A is approved as a<br>
medicamentous agent for the treatment of selected neuromuscular diseases in the US since 1989<br>
and in Germany since 1991 and 1993, respectively. In Germany botulinus toxin-A is available<br>
under the trade name Botox® (distribution by the company Merz, Frankfurt; manufacture:<br>
Allergan, Irvine Ca., USA) and under the trade name Dysport® (distribution by the company<br>
Ispen-pharma, Ettlingen). Since 2001 a further preparation named NeuroBloc® (company Elan,<br>
Munich) has been available which contains the subtype botulinus toxin-B.<br>
The pharmacology, pharmaceutical manufacture as well as numerous clinical applications of<br>
botulinus-toxin are elaborately described in the technical literature [1,2] The clinical effect of the<br>
botulinus toxins is due to a blockade of the release of acetylcholine. Therefore all nerve endings<br>
can be blocked which use acetylcholine as a transmitter.<br>
The successful application of botulinus toxin-A in treatment of the excessive sweating<br>
(hyperhidrosis) has been repeatedly described in the technical literature [3]. On the contrary, the<br>
influence on the body odour was not known up to now. In fact, it was discussed in a scientific<br>
publication on the treatment of hyperhidrosis that the injection of botulinus toxin had no influence<br>
on the body odour [3].<br>
However, it was found surprisingly by the inventor in clinical observations that botulinus toxin is<br>
effective in the case of bromhidrosis and can even improve the body odour of healthy people. The<br>
latter is by no means the corollary of a successful bromhidrosis therapy since the reduction of an<br>
unpleasant or even pathological body odour should merely lead to a less disturbing or at best<br>
neutral body odour but not to the generation of an independent positive body odour.<br>
Therefore one aspect of the present invention consist in the provision of a substance leading to the<br>
fact that the body"s own odour displays an increasingly positive and more pleasant effect,<br>
respectively, on other fellow men and therefore gives a competitive edge to the user in the case of<br>
all interpersonal relations in which the olfactory perception plays a direct or an indirect role.<br>
In this case the botulinus toxin can not only be used in its wild type form but also its derivatives,<br>
fragments or a botulinus toxin with sundry changes e.g. chemical modifications. Thereby<br>
"derivatives" means that the amino acid sequence of the botulinus toxin may contain substitutions,<br>
deletions, insertions or additions. Thereby "fragments" means that only certain parts of the<br>
botulinus toxin may be used as long as these parts display the biological activity of the wild type<br>
botulinus toxin.<br>
Preferably the botulinus toxin is introduced into the skin via intracutaneous injection. This can be<br>
accomplished for example by the use of a syringe with acute hypodermic needles and gauge<br>
needles (e.g. 30 gauge), respectively, or by any other method for injection (e.g. high pressure and<br>
needle less injection, respectively). The injections are evenly distributed e.g. in a distance of 0.5 to<br>
5 cm over the area of skin to be treated. Other injections e.g. subcutaneous or intra epidermal<br>
ones are possible as well.<br>
Also other forms of application such as spreading of the botulinus toxin in a suitable preparation<br>
(e.g. gel, creme, ointment, spray) with or without additives assisting the penetration of skin, are<br>
suited, as long as a transcutaneous absorption of the active agent is provided. Equally, the active<br>
agent can be applied on and introduced into the skin, respectively, using a water bath or a bath of<br>
an ulterior solvent with or without the application of feeble current (iontophoresis).<br>
Preferably a ready-for-use injection solution of botulinus toxin is prepared. Such can be prepared<br>
e.g. by dissolving of one packaging unit of the preparation Botox® or of the preparation Dysport®<br>
in sterile physiological saline solution (e.g. 1-10 ml or a volume freely to be determined). Or the<br>
preparation Neurobloc®" is used which is available already in a dissolved form. Or any subtypes of<br>
botulinus toxins (e.g. A, B, C, D, E, F, G) and derivatives, fragments or forms of these botulinus<br>
toxins are used, respectively, which are changed in any respect. Or combinations of several<br>
botulinus toxin subtypes or combinations with other substances and auxiliary substances,<br>
respectively, are used which are suited for one of the above mentioned modes of application. The<br>
concentration of the active agent in the solution (determined in mouse units per ml) can be chosen<br>
freely according to the individual needs and experiences.<br>
Preferably, the armpit is suited for the treatment, however, any other region of the body can be<br>
treated with it such as the inguinal region, the gluteal region, the feet. Any form of a supporting<br>
pre- or after-treatment, e.g. by spreading of an analgetic creme, cooling, maceration of the skin or<br>
a creme or ointment changing the odour, or other external applications of any kind can be<br>
combined with one of the above mentioned forms of application.<br>
The following examples serve for illustration and are not to be mistaken as limiting the invention.<br>
A patient with strong body odour emanating from the armpit received 50 units Botox"® solved in<br>
2 ml NaCl distributed on 10 intracutaneous injection points per armpit. After one week he<br>
detected a considerable decrease of the intensity of his body odour though having the same<br>
hygienic habits.<br>
Example 2 - pilot study<br>
A group of 16 test persons was examined after education and acquiescence in written form. Each<br>
test person was asked not to use a deodorant, perfume or perfume soap etc., not to eat onions,<br>
asparagus or garlic and not to have intimate or close contact with partners for three days. On the<br>
third day each test person was asked to wear a white T-shirt (100% cotton, pre-washed) for 24<br>
hours from noon time to noon time. After this the underarm parts of the T-shirts were cut out and<br>
put separately into air-tightly lockable glass flasks. These were labelled anonymously and then<br>
presented to the participants as olfactory samples with each participant taking a smell of all<br>
olfactory samples without knowing whom they were derived from. After this each participant<br>
received an injection treatment in both armpits with ten cut-in points per side. On the one side<br>
thereby 100 units botulinus toxin-A (Dysport®) solved in 2 ml isotonic NaCl-solution where<br>
administered and on the other side 2 ml isotonic saline solution. Neither the physician nor the<br>
participant knew which side was treated with the active agent or with the control solution<br>
(double-blind). After one week the T-shirt olfactory test was repeated under exactly the same<br>
conditions. After the statistical analysis a highly significant difference between the both sides was<br>
to be found: the armpits treated with botulinus toxin and the T-shirt cut-outs, respectively,<br>
smelled less intensive and less unpleasant and more pleasant, respectively, than the controls.<br>
Example 3 - pilot study<br>
56 women were asked to assess the olfactory samples of 16 foreign donors. The methodology for<br>
the preparation of the olfactory samples was analogous to example 2, i.e. there were two samples<br>
from each donor: one from the botulinus toxin-treated armpit and one from the untreated armpit.<br>
The women were asked to assess the following:<br>
1.   Which of the two samples smells more pleasant (double-blind approach)?<br>
2.  How is the olfactory quality: (7 point-scale reaching from -3=very unpleasant, over 0=neutral<br>
up to +3=very pleasant)?<br>
3.  How would you describe the odour (positive or negative adjectives were given for choice, e.g.<br>
bloomy versus purulent, fruity versus rancid, etc.)?<br>
4.  How do you feel while perceiving this odour (9 points of valency)?<br>
5.  Can you imagine having a partner with this odour?<br>
6.  What falls into your mind concerning this odour?<br>
Analysis: The pair-wise comparisons were calculated by means of the McNemar x2 -test for<br>
repeated measurements of nominal data points.<br>
The odour of the side which was botulinus toxin-treated was high significantly sensed as more<br>
pleasant (p
Positive adjectives were high significantly used more often for the botulinus toxin-treated samples.<br>
The women felt high significantly "securer" and "happier" in the case of the perception of the<br>
botulinus toxin-treated samples and they could also high significantly imagine more often to have<br>
a partner with the odour of a botulinus toxin-treated armpit than with the odour of an untreated<br>
one (each p
