				<td>NEW CHIRAL SALEN CATALYST AND METHODS FOR THE<br><br>
PREPARATION OF CHIRAL COMPOUNDS FROM RACEMIC EPOXIDES BY<br><br>
USING NEW CATALYST<br>
Technical Field<br><br>
The present invention relates to new chiral salen catalysts and methods for the preparation of chiral compounds from racemic epoxides by using new catalyst. More particularly, the present invention is to provide novel chiral salen catalysts and their uses for producing chiral compounds having high optical purity to be used as raw materials for preparing chiral medicines or food additives in a large scale economically, wherein the chiral salen catalyst having a particular molecule structure can be reused continuously without any activating process of used catalysts and cause no or little racemization after the reaction is completed, because it maintains its catalytic activity after the reaction process.<br>
Background Art<br><br>
Chiral expoxides or chiral 1,2-diols have been widely used to prepare pharmaceuticals, agriculture products and food additives having optical properties (USP 5,071,868; Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 28, No. 16, 1783, 1987; J. Org. Chem., Vol. 64, 8741, 1999). Even if these chiral epoxides<br><br><br>
or chiral 1,2—diols having high optical purity are very useful compounds industrially, use of these compounds has been restricted because the preparation of such compounds is too difficult to produce in a large scale with low manufacturing price and the optical purity, which is an important factor in determining the quality of products, is insufficient. Because enantiomers have radically different biological activity, the FDA has stated that "compounds having the same structure and composition are treated as different compounds if they are optical stereoisomers" so that pharmaceutical feedstocks, and fine chemical feedstocks must be produced with utmost concern for the chirality of the molecules. Generally, the chirality of the molecules having higher than 99.5% is acceptable for the pharmaceutical feedstocks, fine chemical feedstocks, and foods additives.<br><br>
A preparation method of chiral epichlorohydriris as one of chiral expoxides is disclosed using microorganism in EP Patent No. 431,970 and JP Patent Publication Nos. 90— 257895 and 94-211822. However, it is not recommended because the productivity is low and it, further, requires more than two-step process. Another preparation method of chiral epichiorohydrins from chiral sulfonyloxyhaloalcOhOl derivatives obtained from mannitol derivatives is disclosed in USP 4, 408, 063; and J. Org. chem., Vol 43, 4876, 1978.<br>
Another preparation method of chiral epichlorohydrins from 3-chloro-l,2-propanediol is also disclosed in Syn. Lett No.<br><br>
12, 1927, 1999. However, these processes are required multi-step syntheses, so that they are also deficient to use for the industrial purpose.<br><br>
Methods for preparing chiral expoxides generally use a chiral catalyst having stereoselectivity which hydrolyzes stereoselectively only one isomer from racemic epoxides mixed 50 and 50 of each isomer and leaves the un-hydrolyzed isomer in the reaction medium. However, the chiral catalyst used for said stereoselective hydrolysis is required to be economical, have high stereoselectivity and be re-usable without employing activation process, thus suitable for the industrial purpose.<br><br>
Stereoselective hydrolyses of chiral epoxides using chiral salen catalyst as a chiral catalyst are recently disclosed in Science, Vol. 277, 936, 1997; USPs 5,665,890, 5,929,232, 5,637,739, and 5,663,393; and WOOO/09463 and W091/14694. It has been reported that the use of chiral salen catalyst provides higher yield with higher optical purity compared to uses of other chiral catalysts.<br><br>
However, it is reported that after hydrolysis of racemic epoxide using said chiral salen catalyst, the product chiral epoxide is racemized as time goes in pages 86-87 of WOOO/09463. The hydrolysis of racemic epoxides is<br>
performed by employing said chiral catalyst and water to hydrolyze stereoselectively only one isomer from R and S isomers. The unhydrolyzed chiral epoxide is isolated from the reaction medium. During the purification process to isolate the desired chiral epoxide, the racemization is caused by the side reaction of hydrolyzed product (chiral 1,2—diol) due to instability of the chiral salen catalyst. Therefore, this method also has a fatal drawback for mass-production of chiral compounds.<br><br>
When this hydrolysis is performed for mass production, the racemization of the product becomes deepened since it takes longer to perform the distillation to obtain the desired product, thus resulting in decrease of optical purity of the chiral epoxide. Therefore, the use of chiral salen catalyst in the production of chiral epoxides is limited for the above-mentioned reasons.<br><br>
Further, when conventional chiral salen catalysts are reused, it requires an activation process after each use because activities thereof are rapidly decreased. Even if the catalyst is activated after used, the optical activity of the product prepared by using reused catalyst is remarkably lower than that of the product prepared by using fresh catalyst. Thus, there is limited to reuse. Such problems increase the manufacturing price of producing chiral epoxides.<br><br>
Consequently, demand to produce chiral compounds such as chiral epoxides or chiral 1,2-diols efficiently and economically has been highly increased with the importance of such compounds to prepare pharmaceuticals and agriculture products.<br><br>
Especially, in preparing chiral medicines or chiral intermediates, it is very difficult or almost impossible to further increase the optical purity of the same product once it is prepared, or to remove undesired optical stereoisomer, unlike the chemical purity. Thus, the technique for preparing chiral compounds having a high optical purity, which is sufficient for the materials for medicines, in the present invention is distinct, efficient and different from the preparation techniques which only focus on heightening the ratio of the desired stereoisomer in the racemic compounds.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br><br>
The present invention has been resulted from resolving deactivation of chiral catalysts and racemization of chiral products because conventional chiral salen catalysts having an acetate group (OAc) or a halogen group loose their activities or functional groups such as acetate groups or halogen groups thereof, which cause racemization of chiral products. In other words, it is important to<br><br>
select appropriate counterions bonded to the center metal in chiral salen catalysts used in stereoselective hydrolyses of racemic epoxides. For example, chiral catalysts having nucleophilic groups such as acetate and halogen group as counterions deteriorate the optical purity of products since these counterions have weak bonds to the center metal and some dissociated counterions participate in the reverse reaction of the hydrolyzed product, 1,2-diols, resulting in the racemization of the chiral products and further, counterions bonded weakly to the center metal in chiral catalysts can be dissociated during the reaction process, resulting in diminished catalytic activity.<br><br>
The present invention provides novel chiral salen catalysts comprising one molecule of LQ3 wherein L is boron (B) or aluminium (Al); and Q is a halogen atom selected from the group consisting of F, Cl, Br and I, and two molecules of chiral salen ligands. The chiral salen catalyst of the present invention has an activating group of LQ3, most preferably BE3, having no nucleophilic property, which does not affect racemization of chiral epoxides and loose its activity after the reaction is completed.<br><br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide chiral salen catalysts which not only maintain its excellent activity after used, thus being used continuously<br><br><br>
without activation process and simplifing the manufacturing process but also contribute to produce high optical purity of the product without racemization.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an economical process for preparing chiral epoxides and chiral 1,2—diols to be used as raw materials for chiral medicines or food additives from racemic epoxides by using said chiral salen catalyst in high yield and high optical purity.<br>

As shown in the following scheme 1, the chiral salen catalyst of formula 1 in accordance with the present invention can be prepared by first reacting the compound of formula 2 with metal acetate in a proper organic solvent, followed by filtering it to obtain a solid compound of formula 3, and then reacting the resulted compound with LQ3 (for example, BF3, BCl3, BBr3, B13 or AlCl3) in a proper organic solvent.<br><br><br>

wherein R1, R2, R'1, R'2, R3, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, Y1, Y2, M, n, L and Q are as defined in the above formula 1.<br><br>
The compound of formula 2 used in the preparation of the chiral salen catalyst of formula 1 can be easily purchased or prepared by a known method disclosed in J. Org. Chem., Vol. 59, 1939, 1994. LQ3 such as BF3, BCl3, BBr3, B13 or AlCl3 can be added in various forms including a hydrated form or a complex. For example, boron trifluorides include boron trifluoride dihydrate, boron trifluoride—acetic acid complex, boron trifluoride t-butyl methyl etherate, boron trifluoride dibutyl etherate, boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, boron trifluoride dimethyl etherate, boron trifluoride-ethylamine complex, boron trifluoride-methanol complex, boron trifluoride-methyl sulfide complex, boron trifluoride-phenol complex, boron trifluoride-phosphoric<br><br>

The mechanism of preparing chiral epoxides or chiral 1,2-diols from racemic epoxides in the presence of the chiral salen catalyst of formula 1 by stereoselective hydrolysis is shown in Scheme 2,<br>
 [Scheme 2]<br>
	(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
wherein P is C1-C10 alkyl group, C2-C6 alkenyl group, C2-C6 alkynyl group, C3-C8 cycloalkyl group, C1-C10 alkoxy group, phenyl group, carbonyl group, carboxy group, ketone group, aldehyde group, ester group, phosphoryl group, phosphonate group, phosphine group, sulfonyl group or (CH2)1-R5 (wherein, P5 is C2-C6 alkenyl group, C2—C6 alkynyl group, C2-C6 alkoxy group, phenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl,<br>

The stereoselective hydrolysis of scheme 2 comprises steps of reacting racemic epoxide of formula 4 with water in the presence of chiral salen catalyst of formula 1; selectively hydrolyzing either (R)-epoxide or (5)-epoxide; and subsequently separating the unhydrolyzed epoxide from the hydrolyzed epoxide. The stereoselective hydrolysis of Scheme 2 is described in more detail hereinafter.<br><br>
Racemic epoxide compound of formula 4, 0.3-0.8 equivalents of water and over 0.001 mol% of a chiral salen catalyst of formula 1, preferably 0.1-5 mol%, are reacted at a temperature of —10 to 500C, preferably 5 to 25~C. After the reaction is completed, the unhydrolyzed epoxide is separated out by fractional distillation or thin film evaporator at a low temperature of —10 to 500C and the<br>
chiral 1,2-diol is extracted with an organic solvent from the residue. The recovered catalyst is re—used for hydrolysis of fresh racemic epoxide to produce chiral epoxide or chiral 1,2—diol without any activation process.<br><br>
In the stereoselective hydrolysis according to the present invention, the chiral salen catalysts of formula 1 having RR configuration (hereafter referring to as "I-RR") produce (R)-epoxides or (S)—l,2-diols, while the chiral salen catalysts of formula 1 having SS configuration (hereafter referring to as "I—SS") produce (5)—epoxides or (R) —1,2-diols.<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a graph comparing the difference in the reaction rate by employing a representative chiral salen catalyst (I—RR—1) of the present invention and a comparative catalyst 1 having the same 3-dimensional structure as the conventional catalyst over reaction time. According to Fig. 1, the catalyst of the present invention has a reaction rate much higher than that of the comparative catalyst 1.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Fig. 2 is a graph comparing the difference in kinetics of the reaction by employing a representative chiral salen catalyst (I-RR-1) of the present invention and a comparative catalyst 1 having the same 3—dimensional structure as the conventional catalyst. According to Fig. 2, rate data obtained with the representative chiral salen catalyst (I-RR-1) of the present invention has a linear correlation with positive slope and nonzero Y-intercept, wherein the X axis is the concentration of the catalyst and the Y axis is the value of the reaction'rate divided by the concentration of the catalyst. Indication of this graph is consistent with participation of both intramolecular pathway and intermolecular pathway as shown in the following Equation 1.<br><br><br>
[Equation 1]<br>
	Rate  kintra[concentration	of	cat.]	+<br><br>
kinter[concentration of cat.]2<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Especially, the fact that the chiral salen catalyst affects an intramolecular pathway indicates that the configuration thereof has a sandwich configuration having BF3 at the center.<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph showing the reaction rate by employing a representative chiral salen catalyst (I—RR—l) of the present invention according to the number of times it is used and Fig. 4 is a graph showing the reaction rate by employing a conventional chiral salen catalyst having an acetate group (QAc), comparative catalyst 2, according to the number of times it is used.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
According to Figs. 3 and 4, it is noted that the use of the chiral salen catalyst of the present invention exhibits higher optical purity (over 99%ee) of the chiral epoxides than that of the comparative catalyst 2 having an acetate group. It is further proved that the chiral salen catalyst of the present invention can be reused continuously without any activation process, while the conventional chiral salen catalyst having an acetate group has to be activated with acetic acid after each use because it looses its catalytic activity and the reaction using recovered catalyst takes much longer to obtain over 99%ee of optical purity of the product than that using a fresh catalyst (see Table 1)<br><br>
Fig. 5 is a graph comparing .the difference in degree of the racemization of chiral epoxides produced by employing a representative chiral salen catalyst (T—RR—l) of the present invention, a chiral salen catalyst having an acetate group (comparative catalyst 2), and a chiral salen<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In Fig. 5, when the chiral salen catalyst of the present invention is used, there is no or little of racemization over reaction time, while when conventional chiral salen catalyst having an acetate group (QAc, comparative catalyst 2 or conventional chiral salen catalyst having a bromide group (Br, comparative catalyst 3) is used, the degree of racemization becomes higher over reaction time, resulting in lowering optical purity of the corresponding product because the conventional chiral salen catalysts contain counterions having a nuclophilic property. In the mass production of chiral epoxides, it will take longer reaction time to distill the desired product. Therefore, it is expected that use of the chiral salen catalyst of the present invention contributes to produce optically pure chiral epoxide after purification process, while use of the comparative catalyst 2 or 3 produces much lowered optical purity of the product due to<br>
racemization during distillation process.<br><br>
Fig. 6 is a graph comparing the difference in the reactivity of a representative chiral salen catalyst (I-RR1) of the present invention and catalysts prepared by<br>
combining	chiral	salen	ligand	(3-RR-1)	and	boron<br><br>
trifluoride in varied ratios. In Fig. 6, it is noted that the reaction employed with chiral salen catalyst of the present invention exhibits faster reaction and less racemization than that using the others.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Fig. 7 is a graph comparing the difference in the reactivity of chiral salen catalyst prepared by mixing a comparative catalyst 1 with the same mole of chiral salen ligand (3-RR-l) and a comparative catalyst prepared by mixing a comparative catalyst 2 with the same mole of chiral salen ligand (3-RR-1) to be the ratio of ligand and BF3 (or OAc) of 2:1 in order to have the same structure of the chiral salen catalyst of the present invention comprising two molecules of chiral salen ligand and one molecule of BF3. In Fig. 7, the chiral salen catalyst<br>
prepared by mixing a comparative catalyst 1 with the same mole of chiral salen ligand (3-RR-1) exhibits superior efficiency when the ratio of Co(salen) represented by formula 3—RR-1 and BF3 is 2:1 unlike the comparative catalyst 2. Therefore, it duly illustrates that the chiral salen catalyst of the present invention (I-RR—1) has not only a different 3-dimensional structure from the conventional chiral salen catalyst but also a different reaction mechanism where BF3 participates from the conventional ones.<br><br>
Fig. B is a graph comparing the difference in the reaction rate by employing a chiral salen catalyst comprising two molecules of chiral salen ligands (3-RR-l) and one molecule of BF3, BCl3, AICl3, B(OPh)3, or B(OMe)3 mixed in a ratio of 2:1. Fig. 9 is a graph comparing the difference in the reaction rate by employing the catalyst comprising chiral salen ligand(3-RR-1) and BCl3 mixed in a ratio of 2:1 and a comparative catalyst comprising chiral salen ligand(3-RR-1) and BCl3 mixed in a ratio of 1:1 which has the same 3-dimensional structure as the conventional catalyst. Fig. 10 is a graph comparing the difference in the reaction rate by employing the catalyst comprising chiral salen ligand(3-RR—1) and AlCl3 mixed in a ratio of 2:1 and a comparative catalyst comprising chiral salen ligand(3-RR—1) and AlCl3 mixed in a ratio of 1:1 which has<br>
the same 3—dimensional structure as the conventional catalyst. In Fig. 8, it is noted that the chiral salen catalysts having 6 valence electrons such as B and Al are more effective. Compared with BF3, BCl3, AlCl3, the chiral salen catalysts prepared by employing B(OMe)3, which has a weak strength in withdrawing electrons, or B(OPh)3, which has a bulky group, shows a relatively slow reaction rate. Further, in Figs. 9 and 10, the chiral salen catalysts of the present invention exhibit remarkably faster reaction rate compared to ones having the same 3—dimensional structure as the conventional catalyst. It illustrates that the chiral salen catalysts of the present invention have a sandwich configuration which is a different structure from the conventional catalysts and the role of BF3, BCl3, AlCl3, B(OPh)3 and B(OMe)3 located in the center is very important.<br><br>
