HAVING TEN OR MORE SPEEDS<br>
CROSS-REFFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/986,697 filed on November 09, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices, and more particularly to a transmission having ten or more speeds, four<br>
planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches or brakes, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A transmission is provided having an input member, an output<br>
member, four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling members and a plurality<br>
of torque transmitting devices. Each of the planetary gear sets includes first,<br>
second and third members. The torque transmitting devices are for example<br>
clutches and brakes.<br>
[0007] In another aspect of the present invention a transmission is<br>
provided having an input member, an output member and first, second, third apd<br>
fourth planetary gear sets each having sun gears, carrier members and ring<br>
gears. The input member is continuously interconnected with the sun gear of the<br>
first planetary gear set and the output member is continuously interconnected<br>
with the carrier member of the third planetary gear set. Additionally, a first<br>
interconnecting member continuously interconnects the carrier member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the sun gear of the third planetary gear set, a second<br>
interconnecting member continuously interconnects the carrier member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the ring gear of the second planetary gear set and, a<br><br>
third interconnecting member continuously interconnects the ring gear of the third<br>
planetary gear set with the carrier member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
Further, a first torque transmitting device is selectively engageable to<br>
interconnect the carrier member of the second planetary gear set with the sun<br>
gear of the fourth planetary gear set, a second torque transmitting device is<br>
selectively engageable to interconnect the ring gear of the first planetary gear set<br>
with the carrier member of the third planetary gear set, a third torque transmitting<br>
device is selectively engageable to interconnect the ring gear of the first<br>
planetary gear set with the sun gear of the fourth planetary gear set, a fourth<br>
torque transmitting device is selectively engageable to interconnect the carrier<br>
member of the second planetary gear set with the ring gear of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set, a fifth torque transmitting device is selectively engageable to<br>
interconnect the ring gear of the fourth planetary gear set with a stationary<br>
member and a sixth torque transmitting device is selectively engageable to<br>
interconnect the sun gear of the second planetary gear set with the stationary<br>
member. The torque transmitting devices are selectively engageable in<br>
combinations of at least four to establish at least ten forward speeo ratios and at<br>
least one reverse speed ratio between the input member and the output member.<br>
[0008] It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets.<br>
[0009] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
transmission having ten forward speeds and at least one reverse.<br><br>
[0010] It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
transmission having four planetary gear sets, a plurality of coupling members and<br>
a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
[0011] Further objects, aspects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent by reference to the following description and<br>
appended drawings wherein like reference numbers refer to the same<br>
component, element or feature.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0012] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>

[0013] FIG. 1 is a lever diagram of an embodiment of a ten speed<br>
transmission according to the present invention;<br>
[0014] FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic view of an embodiment of a ten speed<br>
transmission according to the present invention; and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature ana is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br><br>
[0017] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the ten speed automatic transmission of the present invention<br>
has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between the<br>
elements of the four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of a first<br>
planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a<br>
second planetary gear set and to a first component or eiemer-t of a third<br>
planetary gear set. A second component or element of the third planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to a second component or element of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set.<br>
[0018] Referring now to FIG. 1. an embodiment of a speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual fever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as<br>
interleaved fingers.. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded.<br><br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission<br>
Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference<br>
[0019] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0020] The input member 12 is coupled to the second node 14B of the<br>
first planetary gear set 14. The output member 22 is coupled to the third node<br>
18C of the third planetary gear set 18. The first node 14A of the first planetary<br>
gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16<br>
and to the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18. The second node<br>
18B of the third planetary gear set 18 is coupled to the second node 20B of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0021] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the second node 16B of<br>
the second planetary gear set 16 with the first node 20A of the fourth planetary<br>
gear set 20. A second clutch 28 selectively connects the third node 14C of the<br>
first planetary gear set 14 with the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set<br>
18. A third clutch 30 selectively connects the third node 14C of the first planetary<br>
gear set 14 with the first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A fourth<br><br>
clutch 32 selectively connects the second node 16B of the second planetary gear<br>
set 16 with the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A first brake<br>
34 selectively connects the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20<br>
with a stationary element or a transmission housing 50. A second brake 36<br>
selectively connects the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16 with<br>
a stationary element or the transmission housing 50.<br>
[0022] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the ten speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG 11 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brakes, and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components ;of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0023] For example, the planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear<br>
member 14B, a ring gear member 14C, and a planet gear earner member 14A<br>
that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D (only one of which is shown).<br>
The planet gears 14D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun ge,ar<br>
member 14B and the ring gear member 14C. The planet carrier member 14A; is<br>
connected for common rotation with a first shaft or intermediate member 42 and<br>
a second shaft or intermediate member 44. The sun gear member 14B is<br>
connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12. The ring gear<br>
member 14C is connected for common rotation with a third shaft or intermediate<br>
member 46.<br><br>
[0024] The planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16C, a<br>
ring gear member 16A, and a planet gear carrier member 166 that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 16D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br>
gears 160 are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 16C<br>
and the ring gear member 16A. The ring gear member 16A s connected for<br>
common rotation with second shaft or intermediate member 44. The planet<br>
carrier member 16B is connected for common rotation with a fourth intermediate<br>
member 48. The sun gear member 16C is connected for common rotation with a<br>
fifth shaft or intermediate member 52.<br>
[0025] The planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18A, a<br>
ring gear member 18B, and a planet gear carrier member 18C that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 18D (only one of which is shown). The planet<br>
gears 18D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member 18A<br>
and the ring gear member 18B. The sun gear member 18A is connected for<br>
common rotation with the first shaft or intermediate member 42 The ring gear<br>
member 18B is connected for common rotation with a sixth shaft or intermediate<br>
member 54. The planet carrier member 18C is connected for common rotation<br>
with a seventh shaft or intermediate member 56 and output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0026] The planetary gear set 20 includes a sun gear member 20A, a<br>
ring gear member 20C, and a planet gear carrier member 20B that rotatably<br>
supports a set of planet gears 20D (only one of which is shown). The set of<br>
planet gears 20D are each configured to intermesh with both the sun gear<br>
member 20A and the ring gear member 20C. The sun gear member 20A,is<br><br>
connected for common rotation with an eighth shaft or intermediate member 58.<br>
The planet carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with sixth shaft<br>
or intermediate member 54. The ring gear member 20C is connected for<br>
common rotation with the ninth intermediate member 60.<br>
[0027] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 22 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0028] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or the clutches 26, 28. 30,<br>
32 and the brakes 34 and 36 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or<br>
intermediate members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For<br>
example, the first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect fourth<br>
intermediate member 48 with the eighth intermediate member 58. The second<br>
clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect the third intermediate shaft for<br>
member 46 with the seventh intermediate shaft or member 56. The third clutph<br>
30 is selectively engageable to connect the third intermediate shaft or member<br>
46 with the eighth intermediate shaft or member 58. The fourth clutch 32 is<br>
selectively engageabfe to connect the fourth intermediate member 48 with the<br>
ninth intermediate member 60. The first brake 34 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect the ninth intermediate member 60 with a stationary element or the<br>
transmission housing 50 in order to prevent the ninth intermediate member 60<br>
from rotating relative to the transmission housing 50. The second brake 36 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the fifth intermediate member 52 with a<br><br>
stationary element or the transmission housing 50 in order to prevent the fifth<br>
intermediate member 52 from rotating relative to the transmission Housing 50<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the ten speed transmission 10 will be described It will be<br>
appreciated that the transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least ten forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio with a triple<br>
overdrive. Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio s attained by<br>
engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first<br>
clutch 26, second dutch 28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32, first brake 34 and<br>
second brake 36), as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting<br>
the various combinations of torque-transmitting elements that are activated for<br>
engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear ratios of the<br>
various gear states are also presented although it should be appreciated that<br>
these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may be adjusted over<br>
significant ranges to accommodate various applications and operational criteria<br>
of the transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that may be obtained using<br>
the embodiments of the present invention are also shown in FIG. 3 Of course,<br>
other gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear diameter gear teeth<br>
count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0030] To establish reverse gear, the first clutch 26, the third clutch 3,0.<br>
the first brake 34 and the second brake 36 are engaged or activated. The first<br>
clutch 26 connects the fourth intermediate member 48 with the eighth<br><br>
intermediate member 58. The third clutch 30 connects the third intermediate<br>
shaft or member 46 with the eighth intermediate shaft or member 58. The first<br>
brake 34 connects the ninth intermediate member 60 with a stationary element or<br>
the transmission housing 50 in order to prevent the ninth intermediate member<br>
60 from rotating relative to the transmission housing 50. The second brake 36<br>
connects the fifth intermediate member 52 with a stationary element or the<br>
transmission housing 50 in order to prevent the fifth intermediate member 52<br>
from rotating relative to the transmission housing 50. Likewise, the ten forward<br>
ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and brake<br>
engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0031] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the ten speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all the<br>
clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive<br>
or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear<br>
state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0032] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
