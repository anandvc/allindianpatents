DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, a mode for carrying out the invention will be described hereunder referring to Figs. 1 to 5.<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional front view showing a structure of a button switch according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, the button switch is composed of a key button 11, a key button contact portion 12 which includes a rubber piece having a plurality of thin metal wires embedded therein and electrically conductive films applied to its surfaces, the rubber<br><br>
piece being provided on a lower face of a pushing member of the button switch, and contact patterns 14 print-wired on a printed circuit board 13.<br>
Usually, the key button 11 is formed of silicone rubber or the like. However, according to the invention, the key button is so constructed that a contact member includes a silicone rubber piece 15 provided with electrically conductive films 17, 18 on its upper and lower faces and having metal wires 16 embedded in the silicone rubber pieces so as to interconnect the electrically conductive films 17, 18, as shown in Fig. 2, and this contact member 12 is bonded to the pushing member of the key button.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the electrically conductive patterns print-wired on the printed circuit board. The electrically conductive patterns are arranged in zigzag connection. This has been designed to facilitate the electrically conductive patterns to contact with either of the above-described metal wires.<br>
Operation of the button switch according to the invention will be described referring to Figs. 4 and 5. In the button switch provided with the contact portion according to the invention, in case where the portion to be contacted such as the printed circuit board is free from foreign substances such as dust, oil, or flux of solder, etc., as shown in Fig. 4, normal switching operation can be performed by pushing the pushing member of the key button. Moreover, in case where the foreign substances such as dust, oil, or flux of solder, etc. have been adhered to the portion to be contacted such as the printed circuit board as<br><br>
shown in Fig. 5, the thin metal wires formed of chemical gold, for example, penetrate the aforesaid foreign substances and conduct the switching operation through the electrically conductive film formed on the upper face. Thus, faulty switching operation due to defective electrical conduction between the contacts can be avoided.<br>
As described above, the button switch according to the invention is composed of the key button formed of silicone rubber, and the contact portion which includes the rubber piece of silicone having a plurality of the thin metal wires embedded therein and the electrically conductive films applied to both the surfaces. Therefore, in case where foreign substances such as dust, oil, or flux of solder, etc. have been adhered to the portion to be contacted such as the printed circuit board, the thin metal wires in the contact portion penetrate the foreign substances, whereby stable conduction of electricity can be obtained.<br>
As described hereinabove, the button switch characterized by comprising the key button, and the key button contact portion which includes the rubber piece having a plurality of the thin metal wires embedded therein and the electrically conductive films applied to both the surfaces of the rubber piece, the rubber piece being provided on the lower face of the pushing member of the button switch. With this structure, the problem of defective switching operation can be solved and the stable conduction of electricity can be obtained.<br>
Further, the button switch which comprises the contact<br><br>
member provided on the lower face of the pushing member of the button switch and adapted to be pushed to conduct switching operation of the contact patterns which are printed and wired on the printed circuit board, characterized in that the contact member includes the rubber piece, the electrically conductive films formed on the upper and lower faces of the rubber piece, and the metal wires embedded in the rubber piece so as to interconnect the electrically conductive films, the contact member being bonded to the pushing member. With this structure, the problem of defective switching operation can be solved and the stable conduction of electricity can be obtained.<br>
Further, the electrically conductive films may be made of carbon. with this structure, the problem of defective switching operation can be solved employing the electrically conductive films made of carbon and the stable conduction of electricity can be obtained.<br>
Still further, the metal wires may be  gold wires. With this structure, the favorable electrical conductivity can be realized, the problem of defective switching operation can be solved, and the stable conduction of electricity can be obtained.<br>
Still further, the rubber piece may be made of silicone rubber. With this structure, molding can be easily conducted, the problem of defective switching operation can be solved, and the stable conduction of electricity can be obtained.<br><br><br>
