				<td>Assembly Rail for a GwiLcligear Cabinet<br>
The invention relates to an assembly rail for a switchgear cabinet, and which is in the form of a stamped and bent part and has an assembly wall aligned towards the interior of the switchgear cabinet, lateral retaining means being bent over from the assembly wall and which are fitted with an attachment plate, hooks being stamped out and bent over from the attachment plate, and the hooks being introducible into attachment means of frame profiles of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
Such an assembly rail is known from the Company<br>
Prospectus: Rittal Handbuch 27, page": 178.  The assembly<br>
rails are in the form of U-profile rails, which are<br>
extended at their end faces by means of the retaining means.  The retaining means substantially consist of an attachment plate from which the hooks are bent over through two angles.  In this way there is provided a shoulder extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of the vertical frame profile.  With this shoulder, the hook is supported on the square attachment means of the frame profile.  For fixing to the frame profile, screws are inserted into the attachment plate and into the frame profile.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide an assembly rail of the type already mentioned which enables stable attachment on such frame profiles which are provided with only narrow, slot-shaped attachment means.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved in that the hooks are bent over from the attachment plate about a bending axis extending in the longitudinal direction of the frame profiles, that, proceeding from the bending point a hook shoulder is stamped out, and in that the width of the hook is determined by the thickness of the material of the attachment plate.<br>
In this assembly rail the width of the hook is determined by the thickness of the material of the attachment plate alone.  Thus it can also be incorporated in slot-shaped attachment means.  These attachment means can then have a width which is minimally larger than the thickness of the material of the attachment plate.<br>
Because the hook is bent over about a bending axis extending in the longitudinal direction of the frame profiles, there results between the bending point and the hook shoulder a support point by means of which the hook is supported on the attachment means.  Thus upon loading of the assembly point the bending point is not subject to stress.  The force is introduced only in the support<br>
point provided for it.  In this way stable attachment is achieved.<br>
According to a preferred development of the invention, the hook has on its hook shoulder an oblique portion by means of which, proceeding from the free end of the hook shoulder, it is widened towards the bending point in its extension transversely to the longitudinal direction of the connected frame profile, and the oblique portion is clamped to the attachment means which is formed as a slot receiving means.  By means of this simple measure the retaining means is drawn into registry with the frame profile via the hook.  By means of this wedging of the hook on the slot receiving means alone, the assembly rail is securely attached.  As an additional security, the assembly rail may also be screwed to the frame profile.<br>
A possible variant of the invention is characterised in that the attachment plate is connected via a transitional section to the assembly wall, and in that the hooks, proceeding from the free side facing away from the transitional section, are stamped out and bent over at right angles from the attachment plate.  Because the hooks are stamped out and bent over from the free sides of the attachment plate, they are simple to manufacture. In addition, a situation is achieved in which the hooks are disposed close to the free side of the attachment<br>
plate.  An associated profile side of the frame profile which carries the slot receiving means can be of a correspondingly narrow design.  Thus a compact connection between the frame profile and the assembly rail is possible.<br>
In order to compensate for tolerances the hooks may be connected to the attachment plate via resilient shoulders.  The resilient shoulders in addition permit secure clamping between the frame profile and the attachment plate.  The resilient shoulders can in this case be so formed that, proceeding from the point at which the hook is bent over, they are cut out of the attachment plate and extend parallel thereto.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a In an assembly unit with an assembly rail having assembly retainers, which is fastened on a vertical profiled frame section of a switchgear cabinet, wherein one or several fastening elements for holding the assembly rail can be affixed to at least a portion of the profiled frame section, characterized in that: the assembly rail having at least one profiled leg with at least one plug retainer plugged into one fastening element, the fastening element adjustable with respect to the vertical profiled frame section for fixing the assembly rail in place, the assembly rail formed as an open hollow profiled section, and the plug retainer formed as an opening extending from an edge of the at least one profiled leg to fit the fastening element as the at least one profiled leg slides into a position adjacent the profiled frame section.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference to an embodiment given by way of example and shown in the drawings, which shows:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1: a perspective side view of a rack, made up of frame profiles, for a switchgear cabinet,<br>
Figure 2: two vertical frame, profiles of the rack<br>
according to Figure 1 with assembly rails which . may be fitted thereto, and<br>
Figure 2a: a detail as identified by X in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rack for a switchgear cabinet.  The rack is substantially made up of a bottom frame 10, a top frame 20 and four vertical frame profiles 40.  The vertical frame profiles 40 connect the bottom frame 10 to the top frame 20.  The bottom and top frames 10 and 20 are identical in construction, so that they may be interchanged.<br>
The bottom and top frame 10 and 20 each have two depth and two width braces 21, 22.  The depth and width braces 21, 22 are provided on their profile sides facing the interior of the rack with rows of attachment means 23, 24.  The upwardly facing profile sides of the bottom frame 10 or the downwardly facing profile sides of the top frame 20 are additionally equipped with respective rows of slot receiving means 24.1.  The vertical frame profiles 40 also are provided with slot receiving means 44, 44.1 facing the interior of the rack.  Thread receiving means 44.2 are disposed between the individual slot receiving means 44, 44.1, 24.1.<br>
The vertical frame profiles 40 are connected via connectors 30 to the bottom or top frames 10, 20.  The connectors 30 are disposed in the area of corner receiving means 25 of the bottom or top frame 10, 20. The vertical frame profiles 40 are attached to the<br>
connector 30 for example by means of screwing.  For this purpose the vertical frame profiles 40 can be provided at the ends with screw receiving means 41.<br>
Two vertical frame profiles 40 of the framework according to Figure 1 are shown as a detail in Figure 2.  The frame profiles have two inner walls 42 aligned towards the interior of the rack.  The inner walls 42 are at right angles to one another.  Two profile sides 43 are folded outward at right angles from the inner walls 42.  Both the inner walls 42 and the profile sides 43 are provided with the slot receiving means 44, 44.1 and the thread receiving means 44.2.  Assembly rails 50 may be attached to these slot receiving means 44, 44.1 and the thread receiving means 44.2.<br>
The assembly rails 50 have an assembly wall 51 which is aligned towards the interior of the rack.  The assembly wall is fitted with a plurality of rows, lying parallel next to one another, of slot receiving means 58 and thread receiving means 58.1.  Folds 52 are folded over at right angles from the wide sides of the assembly wall 51. The folds 52 likewise each have a row of slot receiving means 58 or thread receiving means 58.1.  Retaining means 53 are used to attach the assembly rail 50 to the vertical frame profiles 40.  The retaining means 53 are folded over from the end face of the assembly wall 51.<br>
For this purpose firstly a transitional section 54 is angled off from the assembly wall 51.  The transitional section 54 merges into an attachment plate 55.  The attachment plate 55 is aligned parallel to the assembly wall 51.  On its free side facing way from the transitional section 54, two hooks 56 are stamped out of the attachment plate 55.  The hooks 56 are bent over about a vertical bending axis extending in the longitudinal direction of the frame profiles 40.<br>
This detail can be more closely seen in Figure 2a, which shows on an enlarged scale a detail from Figure 2 identified by X.  It is clearly seen in Figure 2a that the hook has a hook shoulder 56.1 which, proceeding from the bending point, tapers towards its free end.  Thus an oblique configuration is formed.<br>
In order to attach the assembly rail 50 to the vertical frame profiles 40, the hooks 56 are thrust into the slot receiving means 44.  Then the assembly rail is pressed downwards.  In this way the oblique portion of the hook shoulder 56.1 slides past the inner edge of the slot receiving means 44.  In this way the attachment plate 55 is drawn to the profile side 43.  In this final assembly position the assembly rail is supported in the area between the bending point and the hook shoulder 56.1 on<br>
the attachment means 44.  For additional fixing there are provided in the attachment section screw receiving means 57, into which attachment screws 45 can be introduced and screwed into the thread receiving means 44.2 of the profile sides 43 of the vertical or frame profiles 40. The hooks 56 may be connected directly or via the interposition of a resilient shoulder 56.2 to the attachment plate 55.  The use of a resilient shoulder 56.2 has the advantage that the attachment plates are resiliently clamped on the profile sides 43.  In this way also for example, manufacturing tolerances can be compensated for.<br>
It can be seen from Figure 2 that also on the inner walls 42 of the vertical frame profiles 40, assembly rails 50 can be attached.  The assembly rails 50 attached here are shorter than the assembly rails 50 which are attached to the profile sides 43.  Otherwise the assembly rails 50 correspond in their technical design with one another.<br>
Two assembly rails 50 secured to the profile side 43 and lying one above the other can thus be simply connected together via a third, vertically extending assembly rail 50.  The third assembly rail 50 is thus secured in the slot receiving means 58 of the assembly rail 50 with its hooks 56.<br><br><br>
