				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a filling level sensor for detecting a fuel filling level in a<br>
fuel tank of a motor vehicle, with a lever arm which secures a float, follows the<br>
fuel filling level and has a support provided for installation in the fuel tank, and<br>
with a mounting of the lever arm on the support.<br>
Filling level sensors of this type generally have a potentiometer arranged on the<br>
support or a magnetically passive position sensor for detecting the deflection of<br>
the lever arm, and are known from practice. In the case of fuel tanks nowadays<br>
which are generally very shallow and long, the lever arm is likewise very long. For<br>
installation, the filling level sensor is introduced with the float in front into the fuel<br>
tank through an installation opening which is kept very small. The support is<br>
subsequently fastened in the fuel tank. It is necessary in this case for the filling<br>
level sensor to be threaded through the installation opening into the fuel tank in<br>
a sufficiently careful manner, since the lever arm in particular can be damaged.<br>
Furthermore, when the filling level sensor is introduced into the fuel tank, the lever<br>
arm has to be pivoted in order to prevent the float from bumping against a wall<br>
of the fuel tank.<br>
Document US 5,007,450 discloses a filling level sensor for detecting a liquid filling<br>
level in a container with a lever arm which secures a float and follows the liquid<br>
filling level with a support provided for installation in the container and with a<br>
mounting of the lever arm on the support.<br>
The invention is based on the problem of developing a filling level sensor of the<br>
type mentioned at the beginning in such a manner that it permits particularly<br>
simple installation in the fuel tank.<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention in that the<br>
lever arm has a guide part which protrudes laterally over the<br>
support and has a contour having a guide curve on its side<br>
facing away from the support.<br>
This design makes it possible for the lever arm to be deflected<br>
by the guide part when the guide curve is pressed against the<br>
edge of the installation opening. The contour of the guide<br>
curve makes it possible to define the angle through which the<br>
lever arm is deflected as a function of the position of the<br>
filling level sensor according to the invention in relation to<br>
the fuel tank. The lever arm does not therefore need to be<br>
deflected by hand when the filling level sensor according to<br>
the invention is introduced into the fuel tank. The filling<br>
level sensor according to the invention therefore permits<br>
particularly simple installation in the fuel tank. The contour<br>
of the guide curve can be defined in a simple manner as a<br>
function of the shape and length of the lever arm and of the<br>
fuel tank.<br>
In the case of fuel tanks and lever arms of the same shape, the<br>
guide part turns out to be structurally particularly simple,<br>
according to an advantageous development of the invention, if<br>
it has a curved edge pointing away from the support.<br>
Particularly reliable guidance of the lever arm can be achieved<br>
if the filling level sensor slides on one side with an edge of<br>
the support and on the other side with the guide curve of the<br>
guide part along the edge of the installation opening. By this<br>
means, the filling level sensor according to the invention can<br>
be introduced straight into the fuel tank. In this case, the<br>
lever arm is automatically pivoted into the designated<br>
position. According to another advantageous development of the<br>
invention,<br>
such an automatic pivoting of the lever arm can be achieved in<br>
a simple manner if the support has an edge with a smooth<br>
contour on its side facing away from the guide part of the<br>
lever arm.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
existing filling level sensors can be retrofitted in a simple<br>
manner if the guide part has a latching connection on the lever<br>
arm.<br>
The filling level sensor according to the invention can be<br>
manufactured particularly cost-effectively if the guide part is<br>
manufactured integrally with the lever arm.<br>
The lever arm generally has a lever wire fastened to a plastic<br>
clip, the lever wire holding the float. The plastic clip has<br>
latching elements for connection to the lever wire. In the case<br>
of the known filling level sensors, the latching elements are<br>
frequently exposed to the risk of damage if they arrive against<br>
the edge of the installation opening during installation of the<br>
filling level sensor in the fuel tank. However, the risk of<br>
individual components of the filling level sensor according to<br>
the invention being damaged is further reduced if the lever arm<br>
has a plastic clip mounted on the support and a lever wire<br>
which is connected to the plastic clip and secures the float,<br>
and if the guide part is arranged on the plastic clip.<br>
The installation of the filling level sensor according to the<br>
invention in the fuel tank is further simplified if the support<br>
or a component connected fixedly to the support is essentially<br>
the width of an installation opening in the fuel tank. The<br>
filling level sensor according to the invention is therefore<br>
guided<br>
by the support or the component connected to the support and<br>
the edge of the installation opening when it is introduced into<br>
the fuel tank. Since, however, the guide part protrudes over<br>
the support, the lever arm is deflected when the filling level<br>
sensor is introduced into the fuel tank.<br>
The installation of the filling level sensor according to the<br>
invention is further simplified if the support is arranged on<br>
an installation flange designed for the closure of an<br>
installation opening of the fuel tank.<br>
The invention permits numerous embodiments. To further clarify<br>
its basic principle, one of these is illustrated in the drawing<br>
and is described below. In the drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a filling level sensor according to the invention<br>
during introduction into a fuel tank,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the filling level sensor according to the<br>
invention from Figure 1 in the state in which it is<br>
virtually completely introduced into the fuel tank,<br>
Fig. 3 shows, on a greatly enlarged scale, a perspective<br>
illustration of a plastic clip of the filling level<br>
sensor according to the invention from Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a filling level sensor 1 during installation in<br>
a fuel tank 2. The fuel tank 2 has an installation opening 3 .<br>
The filling level sensor 1 has a support 5 fastened to an<br>
installation flange 4. In the fitted state, the installation<br>
flange 4 closes the installation opening 3 of the fuel tank 2,<br>
so that the filling level sensor 1 is situated within the fuel<br>
tank 2. The filling level sensor 1 has a lever arm 7 which<br>
supports a float 6 and is coupled to the support 5 via<br>
a mounting 8. The lever arm 7 has a plastic clip 9 to which a<br>
lever wire 10, which is connected to the float 6, is fastened<br>
via a latching connection 11. The position of the lever arm 7<br>
is detected by a potentiometer 12. In this case, the lever arm<br>
7 may secure, for example, a contact bridge (not illustrated)<br>
which interacts with slideways 13 arranged on the support 5. As<br>
an alternative, the position of the lever arm 7 may also be<br>
detected via a magnetically passive position sensor, with the<br>
lever arm 7 holding a magnet and a resistance network with<br>
spring tongues which can be deflected by the magnet being<br>
arranged on the support 5.<br>
The plastic clip 9 has a guide part 14 which protrudes over the<br>
support 5 and has a guide curve 15. The guide curve 15 is<br>
arranged on an edge 16 pointing away from the support 5. On the<br>
side facing away from the guide part 14, the support 5 has an<br>
edge 17 with a smooth contour. For installation of the filling<br>
level sensor 1 in the fuel tank 2, first of all the float 6 is<br>
introduced through the installation opening 3 into the fuel<br>
tank 2. When the support 5 is subsequently introduced into the<br>
installation opening 3, the guide part 14 arrives against the<br>
boundary of the installation opening 3 and pivots the lever arm<br>
7 in accordance with the contour of the guide curve 15. The<br>
position of the lever arm 7, at which the boundary of the<br>
installation opening 3 deflects the lever arm 7, is illustrated<br>
in Figure 1.<br>
As the filling level sensor 1 is introduced further, the guide<br>
part 14 passes out of the region of the installation opening 3,<br>
as illustrated in Figure 2. This avoids the movement of the<br>
lever arm 7 being obstructed and therefore avoids the guide<br>
part 14 detecting the fuel filling level in the fuel tank 2.<br>
Figure 3 shows, on an enlarged scale in a perspective<br>
illustration, the plastic clip 9 of the filling level sensor 1<br>
from Figure 1 with the guide part 14. It can be seen in this<br>
case that the guide part 14 is manufactured integrally with the<br>
plastic clip 9. The plastic clip 9 has a bearing hole 18 in the<br>
mounting 8, through which an angled end of the lever wire 10<br>
illustrated in Figure 1 is guided and forms the bearing<br>
spindle. The latching connection 11 for securing the lever wire<br>
10 is likewise manufactured integrally with the plastic clip 9.<br>
In an embodiment (not illustrated), the guide part 14 may also<br>
have latching hooks and be latched to the plastic clip 9.<br>

In the case of a filling level sensor (1) for detecting a fuel<br>
filling level in a fuel tank (2), a lever arm (7) which secures<br>
a float (6) has a guide part (14). The guide part (14)<br>
interacts with an installation opening (3) in the fuel tank (2)<br>
and deflects the lever arm (7) in a designated direction. This<br>
avoids the filling level sensor (1) being damaged during<br>
installation in the fuel tank (2).</td>
