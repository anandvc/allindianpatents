TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PYRIDYL AMIDE T-TYPE CALCIUM CHANNEL ANTAGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Plasma membrane calcium chaims are members of a diverse superfamily of voltage gated channel proteins. Calcium channels are membrane-spanning, multi-subunit proteins that allow controlled entry of Ca2+ ions into cells from the extracellular fluid. Excitable cells throughout the animal kingdom, and at least some bacterial, fungal and plant cells, possess one or more types of calcium channel. Nearly all "excitable" cells in animals, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerve cells and muscle cells, including those of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, and venous and arterial smooth muscles, have voltage-dependent calcium channels<br>
Multiple types of calcium channels have been identified in mammalian cells from various tissues, including skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, lung, smooth muscle and brain. A major type of this family are the L-type calcium channels, whose function is inhibited by the familiar classes of calcium channel blockers (dihydropyridines such as nifedipine, phenylalkylamines such as verapamil, and benzothiazepines such as diltiazem). Additional classes of plasma membrane calcium channels are referred to as T, N, P, Q and R.<br>
The "T-type" (or "low voltage-activated") calcium channels are so named because their openings are of briefer duration (T=transient) than the longer (L=long-lasting) openings of the L-type calcium channels. The L, N, P and (-type channels activate at more positive potentials (high voltage activated) and display diverse kinetics and voltage-dependent properties. There are three subtypes of T-type calcium channels that have been molecularly, pharmacologically, and electrophysiologically identified from various warm blooded animals including rat [J Biol. Chem.276(6) 3999-4011 (2001); Eur JNeurosci ll'(12):4171-8(1999); reviewed in Cell Mol Life Sci 56(7-8):660-9 (1999)]. These subtypes have been termed cd G, cd H, and all. The molecular properties of these channels demonstrate that the amino acid sequences are between 60-70% identical. The electrophysiological characterization of these individual subtypes has revealed differences in their voltage-dependent activation, inactivation, deactivation and steady-state inactivation levels and their selectivities to various ions such as barium (J Biol. Chem.276(6) 3999-4011 (2001)). Pharmacologically, these subtypes also have differing sensitivities to blockade by ionic nickel. These channel subtypes are also expressed in various forms due to their ability to undergo various splicing events during their assembly (J Biol. Chem.276(6) 3999-4011 (2001)).<br>
 <br>
T-type calcium channels have been implicated in pathologies related to various diseases and disorders, including epilepsy, essential tremor, pain, neuropathic pain, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, sleep disturbances, psychosis, schizophreniac, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, pain, cancer, diabetes, infertility and sexual dysfunction (J Neuroscience, 14, 5485 (1994); Drugs Future 30(6), 573-580 (2005); EMBO J, 24, 315-324 (2005); Drug Discovery Today, 11, 5/6, 245-253 (2006)). The known therapeutic regimens for such treating such diseases and disorders suffer from numerous problems. Accordingly, a more physiological way to treat these diseases and disorders would be highly desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to pyridyl amide compounds which are antagonists of T-type calcium channels, and which are useful in the treatment or prevention of neurological and psychiatric disorders and diseases in which T-type calcium channels are involved. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which T-type calcium channels are involved.<br>

If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by<br>
 <br>
chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.<br>

The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as T-type calcium channel antagonists may be readily determined without undue experimentation by methodology well known in the art, including the "FLEPR Ca2+ Flux Assay" and the "T-type Calcium (Ca2+) Antagonist Voltage-Clamp Assay" [described by Xia, et al., Assay and Drag Development Tech., 1(5), 637-645 (2003)]. In a typical experiment ion channel function from HEK 293 ceils expressing the T-type channel alpha-1G, H, or I (CaV 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) is recorded to determine the activity of compounds in blocking the calcium current mediated by the T-type channel alpha-1G, H, or I (CaV 3.1, 3.2, 3.3). In this T-type calcium (Ca2+) antagonist voltage-clamp assay calcium currents are elicited from the resting state of the human alpha-1G, H, or I (CaV 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) calcium channel as follows. Sequence information for T-type (Low-voltage activated) calcium channels are fully disclosed u. e.g., US 5,618,720, US 5,686,241, US 5,710,250,US 5,726,035, US 5,792,846, US 5,846,757, US 5,851,824, US 5,874,236, US 5,876,958, US 6,013,474, US 6,057,114, US 6,096,514, WO 99/28342, and J. Neuroscience, 19(6): 1912-1921 (1999). Cells expressing the T-type channels were grown in growth media<br>
 <br>
which comprised: DMEM, 10% Tetsystera approved FBS (Clontech Laboratories Inc.), 100 microgram/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin, 2mM L-Glutamine, 150 microgram/ml Zeocin, 5 microgram/ml Blasticidin. T-channel expression was induced by exposing the cells to 2mM Tetracycline for 24hrs. Glass pipettes are pulled to a tip diameter of 1 -2 micrometer on a pipette puller. The pipettes are filled with the intracellular solution and a chloridized silver wire is inserted along its length, which is then connected to the headstage of the voltage-clamp amplifier. Trypsinization buffer was 0.05 % Trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA. The extracellular recording solution consists of (mM): 130 mM NaCl, 4 mM KC1, ImM MgC12, 2mM CaC12, 20 mM HEPES, 30 Glucose, pH 7.4. The internal solution consists of (mM):  125 CsCl, 10 TEA-CI, 10 HEPES, 8 NaCl, 0.06 CaC12, 0.6 EGTA, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP; 135 mM CsMeS03, 1 MgC12, 10 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4; or 135 mM CsCl, 2 MgC12, 3 MgATP, 2 Na2ATP, 1 Na2GTP, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Upon insertion of the pipette tip into the bath, the series resistance is noted (acceptable range is between 1-4 megaohm). The junction potential between the pipette and bath solutions is zeroed on the amplifier. The cell is then patched, the patch broken, and, after compensation for series resistance ( &gt;= 80%) , the voltage protocol is applied while recording the whole cell Ca2+current response. Voltage protocols: (1) -80 mV holding potential every 20 seconds pulse to -20 mV for 70 msec duration; the effectiveness of the drug in inhibiting the current mediated by the channel is measured directly from measuring the reduction in peak current amplitude initiated by the voltage shift from -80 mV to -20 mV; (2). -100 mV holding potential every 15 seconds pulse to -20 mV for 70 msec duration; the effectiveness of the drug in inhibiting the current mediated by the channel is measured directly from measuring the reduction in peak current amplitude initiated by the shift in potential from -100 mV to -20 mV. The difference in block at the two holding potentials was used to determine the effect of drug at differing levels of inactivation induced by the level of resting state potential of the cells. After obtainir 3 control baseline calcium currents, extracellular solutions containing increasing concentrations of a test compound are washed on. Once steady state inhibition at a given compound concentration is reached, a higher concentration of compound is applied. % inhibition of the peak inward control Ca2+ current during the depolarizing step to -20 mV is plotted as a function of compound concentration.<br>
The intrinsic T-type calcium channel antagonist activity of a compound which may be used in the present invention may be determined by these assays. Tn particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in antagonizing the T-type calcium channel in the aforementioned assays, generally with an IC50 of less than about 10 uM.
