COMPOUNDS WITH GROWTH HORMONE RELEASING PROPERTIES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, compositions containing them, and their use for treating nedical disorders resulting from a deficiency in growth horncne.<br>
' BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Growth hormone is a hormone which stimulate, growth of all tissues capable of growing. In addition, growth hortone  is known to have a . 'number of effects on metabolic processes, e.g., stimulation of<br>
protein synthesis and free fatty acid mobilization and to cause a<br>
switch in energy metabolism from carbohydrate tc fatty acid • metabolism. Deficiency in growth hormone  result in a number of<br>
severe medical disorders, e.g., dwarfism.<br>
Growth hormone is released from the pituitary. Tha release is under<br>
tight control of a number of hormones and neurotransmitters either<br>
directly or indirectly. Growth hormone release can b-2 stimulated by<br>
growth hormone releasing hormone (GJQH) inhibited by<br>
somatostatin. In both cases the hormones are released from the<br>
hypothalamus but their action is mediated primerily via specific<br>
receptors located in the pituitary. Other compounds uhich stimulate<br>
the release of growth hormone from the  also been<br>
described. For example arginine, L-3, J-dihycroyphenylalanine<br>
(L-Dopa) , glucagon, vasopressin, PACAP (pituitary aclenylyl cyclase<br>
activating peptide), muscarinic receptor agonist;; and a synthethic<br>
hexapeptide, GHRP (growth hormone releasing peptide) release<br>
endogenous growth hormone either by a direc; effect on the<br>
pituitary or by affecting the release of GF.RH ard/cr somatostatin<br>
from the hypothalamus.	<br>
In disorders or conditions where increased, levels of growth hormone is desired, the protein nature of growth hormone  anything but<br><br>
./<br>
parenteral administration non-viable. Furthermore, other directly acting natural secretagogues, e.g., GHRH and PACAP, are longer polypeptides for which reason oral administration of them is not viable.<br>
The use of certain compounds for increasing the levels of growth hormone in mammals has previously been proposed, e.g. in EP 18 072, EP 83 864, WO 89/07110, WO 89/01711, WO 89/10933, WO 88/9780, WO 83/02272, WO 91/18016, WO 92/01711, WO 93/04081, WO 95/17422, WO 95/17423 and WO 95/14666.<br>
The composition of growth hormone releasing compounds is important for their growth hormone releasing potency as well as their bioavailability. It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide compounds with growth hormone releasing properties which have improved properties rolative to known peptides of this type.<br>

(Tetrahedron Letters, 1991, 32, 1867 - 1870.): The titanium-homoenolate 9 may be generated from 3-iodopropionic acid 8 and added onto a suitable aldehyde 7. A cyclization in e.g acetic acid may furnish the lactone 11. Alkylation of the lactone may be done as described by e.g. A. H. Fray et al. (J. Org. Chem., 1986, 51, 4828 - 4833). The enolate may be generated by treatment with base such as lithium hexamethyldisilazane (LHDS) or Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and reacted with a suitable alkylating reagent such as; alkylchloride to give a compound of type 12.

After separation of diastereoisomeres, the ring can be opened by reaction with acid as described by e.g." R. E. TenBrinJc (J. Org. Chew. 1987, 52, 418 - 422.) and the araino-group can be protected to give a compound 25. The E-fragraent, that may contain protected functionalities, can be attached by reaction of a suitable amine using e.g. l-ethy1-3 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT).

The carrier may contain additives such as solubilizing agents, e.g. propylene glycol, surfactants, absorption enhancers such as lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) or cyclodextrin, or preservatives such as parabenes.<br>
Generally, the compounds of the present invention are dispensed in unit dosage form comprising 50-200 mg of active ingredient together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier per unit dosage.<br>
The dosage of the compounds according to this invantion is suitably 0.1-500 mg/day, e.g." from about 5 to about 50 mg, such as about 10<br>
i<br><br>
mg per dose, when administered to patients, e.g. humans, as a drug.<br>
It has been demonstrated that compounds of the general formula I possess the ability to release endogenous growth hormone in vivo. The compounds may therefore be used in the treatment of conditions which require increased plasma growth hormone levels such as in growth hormone deficient humans or in elderly patients or livestock.<br>
Thus, in a particular aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, the composition comprising, as an active ingredient, a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, the method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In a still further aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceuticalμ acceptable salt thereof for the preparation of a medicament for stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary.<br>
To those skilled in the art, it is well known that the current and potential uses of growth hormone in humans are varied and multitudinous. Thus, compounds of formula I can beμ administered for purposes stimulating release of growth hormone from the pituitary and would then have similar effects or uses as growth hormone itself. The uses of growth hormone may be summarized as follows: stimulation of growth hormone release in the elderly; prevention of catabolic side effects'of "glucocorticoids, prevention and treatment<br><br>
of osteoporosis, stimulation of the immune system, acceleration of wound healing, accelerating bone fracture repair, treatment of growth retardation, treating renal failure or insufficiency ' resulting from growth retardation, treatment of physiological short stature including growth hormone deficient children and short stature associated with chronic illness, treatment of obesity and growth retardation associated with obesity, treating growth retardation associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome and Turner's syndrome; accelerating the recovery and reducing hospitalization of burn patients; treatment of intrauterine growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, hypercortisolism and Cunning's syndrome; induction of pulsatile growth hormone release; replacement of growth hormone in stressed patients, treatment of osteochondrodysplasias, Noonan's syndrome, schizophrenia, depressions, Alzheimer's disease, delayed wound healing and psychosocial deprivation, treatment of pulmonary dysfunction and ventilator dependency, attenuation of protein catabolic responses after major surgery, reducing cachexia and protein loss due to chronic illness such as cancer or AIDS; treatment of hyperinsulinemia including nesidioblastosis, adjuvant treatment for ovulation induction; to stimulate thymic development and prevent the age-related decline of thymic function, treatment of immunosuppressed patients, improvement in muscle strength, mobility, maintenance of skin thickness, metabolic homeostasis, renal homeostasis in the frail elderly, stimulation of osteoblasts, bone remodelling and cartilage growth, stimulation of the immune system in companion animals and treatment of disorder of aging in companion animals, growth promoter in livestock and stimulation of wool growth in sheep.<br>
For the above indications the dosage will vary depending on the compound of formula I employed, on the mode of administration and on the therapy desired. However, generally dosage levels between 0.0001 and 100 mg/kg body weight daily are administered to patients and animals to , obtain....effective release of endogenous growth<br><br>
hormone. Usually, dosage forms suitable for oral, nasal, pulmonal<br>
9<br>
or transdermal administration comprise from atout. 0.0001 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the compounds of formula I admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be administered in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form or, where appropriate, as a alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or lower alkylammonium salt. Such salt forms are believed to exhibit approximately the same order of activity as the free base forms.<br>
Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition of rhe invention may comprise a compound of formula I combined vith one or more compounds exhibiting a different activity, e.g., an antibiotic or<br>
'other, pharmacologically active material.<br>
The route of administration may be any route which effectively transports the active compound to the appropriate or desired site of action, such as oral, nasal, pulmonary, transdermal or parenteral, the oral route being preferred.<br>
Apart from the pharmaceutical use of the compounds of formula I, they may be useful in vitro tools for investigating the regulation of growth hormone release.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be useful in vivo tools for evaluating the growth hormone releasing capability of the pituitary. For example, serum samples taken before and after administration of these compounds to humans cen be assayed for growth hormone. Comparison of the growth hbrmcne in each serum sample would directly determine the ability of the patients pituitary to release growth hormone.<br>
Compounds of formula I--may be administered to commercially<br>
*<br><br>
important animals to increase their rate and extent of growth, and to increase milk production.<br>
A further use of growth hormone secretagogue con-pounds of formula I is in combination with other secretagogues suc:h as GHRP (2 or 6), GHRH and its analogues, growth hormone and its analogues or<br>

somatomedins including IGF-1 and IGF-2.<br>
Pharmacological Methods<br>
Compounds of formula I may be evaluated in vitro ::or their efficacy and potency to release growth hormone in rat pituitary primary cultures.<br>
The isolation of rat pituitary cells is a modificatian of 0. sartor et al., Endocrinology 116, 1985, pp. 952-957. Mal-.e albino Sprague-Dawley rats (250 +/- 25 grams) were purchased from M0llegaard, Lille Skensved, Denmark. The rats were housed in group cages (four animals/cage) and placed in rooms with 12 hour light cycle. The room temperature varied from 19-24'C and the humidity from 3 0 -60%.<br>
The rats were decapitated and the pituitaries dissected. The neurointermediate lobes were removed and the remaining tissue was immediately placed in icecold isolation buffar (Gey's medium (Gibco 041-04030) supplemented with 0.25% D-jlucose, 2% non¬essential amino acids (Gibco 043-01140) and 1% bovine serum albumine (BSA) (Sigma A-4503)). The tissue was cut into small pieces and transferred to isolation buffer supplemented with 3.8 mg/ml of trypsin (Worthington #3707 TRL-3; and 2 30 Jig/ml of DNase (Sigma D-4527). This mixture was incubated at 7 0 rotations/min for 35 min at 37°C in a 95/5% atmosphere of Oμ/CO,. The tissue was then washed three times in the above buffer. Using a standard pasteur pipet, the tissue was then aspirated into single cells. After dispersion, cells were filtered through a nylon filter (160 ,um) to remove undigested, tissue. The cell suspension was washed 3 times<br>

with isolation buffer supplemented with trypsin inhibitor (0.75 mg/ml, Worthington #2829) and finally resuspanded in culture medium; DMEM (Gibco 041-01965) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375), 4 mM glutamine (Gibco 043-05030H), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma S-8875), 0.1% non-essential amino acid, 2.5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco 011-06290), 3% horse serum (Gibco 034-06050) , 10% fresh rat serum, l nM T3 (Sigma T-2752) and 40 pq/l&gt; dexamethasone (Sigma D-4902) pH 7.3, to a density of 2 x 105 cells/ml. The cells were seeded into raicrotiter plates (Nunc, Denmark), 200 jil/well, and cultured for 3 days at 37*C and 8% C02.<br>
Compound testing<br>
After cultaring, the cells were washed twice with stimulation buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco 041-04020) supplemented with 1% BSA (Sigma A-4503), 0.25% D-glucose (Sicma G-5250) and 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375) pH 7.3) and preincubated for 1 hour at 37 °C. The buffer was exchanged with 90 ,ul stimulation buffer (37C). Ten jil test compound solution was added and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37DC and 5% C02. The median was decanted and analyzed for GH content in an rGH SPA test system. .<br>
All compounds were tested in doses ranging from 10 pM to IOO M. A dose-response relation was constructed using the HilL equation (Fig P, Biosoft) . The efficacy (maximal GH released, Emax) was expressed in % of the E„ax of GHRP-6. The potency (EC50) was determined as the concentration inducing half maximal stimulation of the GH release.<br>
Compounds of formula I may be evaluated for their ' metabolic stability.<br>
Compounds were dissolved at a concentration of 1 ,ig/.'-il in water. 25  of this solution is added to 175  of the respective enzyme-solution (resulting in an enzyme:substrate ratio (w/w) of approximately 1:5). The solution is left at 37DC overnight. 10 <br><br>
of the various degradation solutions is analyzed against a corresponding zero-sample using flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) with selected ion monitoring of the molecular ion. If the signal has decreased more than 20?; compared to the zero-sample, the remainder of the solution is analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry in order to identify the extent and site(s) of degradation precisely.<br>
Several standard peptides (ACTH 4-10, Angiotensin 1-14 and Glucagon) have been included in the stability tests in order to verify the ability of the various solutions to degrade peptides.<br>
Standard peptides (angiotensin 1-14, ACTH 4-10 and glucagon) were purchased from Sigma, MO, USA)<br>
Enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase arainopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase Y and B) were all purchased from Boehringer : Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany)<br>
Pancreatic enzyme mix: trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0 (all concentrations 0.025 pg/fil) .<br>

Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using two different mass spectrometers. A Sciex API III triple quadrupole LC-MS instrument (Sciex instruments, Thornhill, Ontario) equipped with an electrospray ion-source and a Bio-Ion 20 time-of-flight Plasma Desorption instrument (Bio-Ion Nordic AB, Uppsala, Sweden).<br>
Quantification of the compounds (before and after degradation) was done on the API III instrument using single ion monitoring of the<br><br>
molecular ion in question with flow injection of the analyte. The liquid flow (MeOH:water 1:1) of 100 min was controlled by an ABI 140B HPLC unit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Divisions, Foster City, CA) . The instrument parameters were set to standard operation conditions, and SIM monitoring was performed using the most intense molecular ion (in most cases this corresponded to the doubly charged molecular ion).<br>
Identification of degradation products furthermore involved the use of plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) with sample application on nitrocellulose coated targets and standard instrumental settings. The accuracy of the hereby determined masses is generally better than 0.1%.<br>
Separation and isolation of degradation products was done using a HY-TACH C-18 reverse phase 4.6x105 mm HPLC column (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA) with a standard acetonitril: TFA separation gradient. The HPLC system used was HP1090M (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA).<br><br><br>
