It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGluRl and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluRS belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group II can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br><br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia, depressions, colon cancer, sleep disorders, disorders of circadian rhythms and glioma since mGluR2 antagonists have been found to reduce cell proliferation in human glioma cells (J. Neurochem. March 2003, 84(6): 1288-95).<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts per se and as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production, as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br>

[3H]-LY354740 binding on mGlu2 transfected CHO cell membranes.<br>
Trcmsfection and cell culture<br>
cDNA encoding the rat mGlu2 receptor protein in pBluescript II was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I-amp from Invitrogen Ltd (Paisley, UK). This vector construct (pcDlmGR2) was co-transfected with a psvNeo plasmid encoding the gene for neomycin resistance, into CHO cells by a modified calcium phosphate method described by Chen &amp; Okayama (1988). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium with reduced L-glutamine (1 mM final concentration), 36mg/L L-Proline and 10 % dialysed foetal calf serum from Gibco-Invitrogen; the medium was supplemented with 500 microM a-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG). Selection was made in the presence of G-418 (300 ug/ml final concentration). Clones were identified by reverse transcription of 5 \ag total RNA, followed by PCR using mGlu2<br><br>
receptor specific primers 5'-atcactgcttgggtttctggcactg-3' and 5'-agcatcactgtgggtggcataggagc-3' in 60 mM Tris HC1 (pH 10), 15 mM (NH4)2S04, 2 raM MgCb, 25 units/ml Taq Polymerase with 30 cycles annealing at 60 °C for 1 min., extention at 72 °C for 30 s, and 1 min. 95 °C denaturation.<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells, cultured as above, were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and frozen at -80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and homogenised with a polytron (Kinematica, AG, Littau, Switzerland) for 10 s at 10 000 rpm. After centrifugation for 30 min. at 4 °C, the pellet was washed once with cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.4). After a second centrifugation for 30 min. at 4 °C the pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.4). Protein content was measured using the Micro BCA method from Pierce-Perbio (Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>
[3H]-LY354740 binding<br>
After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mM MgCb (pH 7.4) (binding buffer). The final concentration of the membranes in the assays was 25 u-g protein/ml. Inhibition experiments were performed with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-LY354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/B glass fiber filters or onto GF/B Unifilter plates and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 uM (25,2'i?,3'i?)-2-(2'3'-Dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCGIV from Tocris, Ellisville, MO USA). After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid from Perkin-Elmer (Boston, MA, USA), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland). For 96-Unifilter plates the radioactivity was measured after addition of Microscint 40 scintillation fluid (Perkin Elmer, Boston MA) using a TopCount NXT (Packard)<br>
Data analysis.<br>
The inhibition curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC50<br>
values, and Hill coefficients.<br><br>
