The present invention is also directed to a novel process and construction of a synthesizer for molecular engineering of the fluids and chemicals to control catalysis, combustion, emissions from combustion and the performance of any heat engine cycle or chemical process.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the molecular engineering of a material using any one or all or a combination of the following namely the electro magnetic waves, microwaves, millimeter waves, ultrasonic waves, sound waves, surface waves, plasma waves, longitudinal electrostatic wiggler, space charge waves, electrostatic ion-cyclotron waves in the presence of an axial magnetic field to propagate through a wave guide containing the material and causing excitation of the electrons, acceleration of the electrons resulting in collisions or collision less space charge formation, plasma generation, plasma acceleration and plasma oscillations facilitating energy transfer with the waves and the plasma to take place for changing any one or all or a combinations of the following namely rranslational, rotational, vibrational energy levels, electronic motions of the molecules of the material resulting in the changes in die molecular energies, change in bond angles, bond alternations, bond orientations, rearrangement of molecular structure,<br><br>

The present invention also provides a device/contrivance to facilitate the process of molecular<br>
engineering of a material as illustrated in the accompanied Figures 1 -4, said device comprising:<br>
a straight pipe (1) carries material, liquid, gas or solid;<br>
the pipe (1) is enclosed by another bigger diameter pipe (2) with its ends closed by bushes (6) acting<br>
as supports for to support holding pipe (1)  and also keeping both the piper (1) &amp; (2) on the same<br>
axis as their centers;<br>
an insulated copper, aluminum or any conducting material with plurality of wire turns (3) for<br>
carrying current are wound over die pipe (2) and the pipe (2) is magnetized by applying an electric<br>
potential;<br>
a co-axial system comprising pipe (1) and pipe (2) is enclosed by another pipe (4) with its ends<br>
closed by metal disk or plate having hole at the center similar to a washer with insulated bushes (5)<br>
and (8) for holding the co-axial pipe (1) and pipe (2) system also at its center ensuring that the center<br>
lines of all the three pipes are in the same axis and tiSe whole system acts as a magnetron and as a<br>
cold plasma generator cum plasma accelerator;<br>
The hollow cavity of pipe (2) with semiconductor layer (7) may contain air or any gas or any dielectric material or made vacuum filled with vacuum and die space between pipe (2) and cavity of pipe (4) with semiconductor layer (7) is filled with air at an atmospheric pressure or with any gas or with any dielectric insulation material or filled with vacuum;<br>
the ends of the insulated wire turns are connected to an electric potential to pass electric current to magnetize the pipe (2) and to resonate electromagnetic waves inside die cavity of pipe (2) where the modes of propagation and frequency is dependant upon the diameter, length of the cavity pipe (2)for single cavity and dependent upon the diameters and lengths of pipe (2) and (1) for a co-axial cavity;<br><br>
a casing (/; naving a tluid How passage (10) and serving as a means for cooling the device from over heating as also for increasing the temperature of fluid flowing through pipe (1) as shown in figure 3; and brackets (9) for earth grounding;<br>
The functional features of the device of the present invention is further explained in the form of following embodiments:<br>
The presence of pipe (1) in the same axis of pipe (2) make a co-axial cavity resonator and the frequency of electromagnetic waves or microwaves or any other waves generated and propagated through it depends upon the inner diameters of the pipe (1) and the inner diameter of pipe (2), the lengths of both pipe (1) and pipe (2).<br>
Depending upon the material of pipe (1) and the dielectric property and material of bushes at the ends of pipe (2), the electric potential of pipe (1) and the magnetic and electrical behavior of pipe (1) could be altered other than pipe (2) or kept as the same as pipe (2). Pipe (1) also acts as a wave¬guide for electromagnetic waves with various modes and other waves or oscillations generated. When an electric potential is applied to the ends of die insulated wire turns and pipe (2) becomes magnetized, there is an axial field created by external coils and an azimuthal field created by internal conductors with a current value resulting in plasma contained between the concentric cylinders and the loss along field lines is prevented by an electric potential created by annular grids at the ends of the cylinder biased to negative potential by grounding to earth through brackets (9) or kept at positive potential as the case may be and electromagnetic waves starts resonating inside the cavities of pipe (4), pipe (2) pipe (1) due to co-axial construction or at least in any one of them, the electrons originating from the conduction band of the semiconductor layers (7) of the co-axial pipes due to thermal ionization, electromagnetic ionization of the semiconductor are excited, pipe (2) becomes a positive potential and pipe (1) too depending upon the end bush material and it"s dielectric property and electrons are radially confined by the positive potential of the pipe (2) and pipe (1) and orbit around it in low angular momentum, non circular orbits and the electrons would be adiabatically compressed into die interaction region where the radial electric field would be large. This increase the electron density as well as the ratio of their perpendicular to parallel energy and electrons would rapidly transit the interaction region where they would resonantly transfer their energy to the radiation fields. This result in microwave amplification by stimulated emission radiation and an electron beam is produced whose distribution function is optimized for the power level requirements of the apparatus and the axis of the electron beam coincides with mat of the wave guide pipe (1). Pipe (1) carries the liquid, gas or chemical or solid or all and when the material<br><br>
flows through pipe (1), the magnetic fields cause magneto hydrodynamic conditions along with excitation of the electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor layer (I) of the pipe (1) and a plasma pinch is formed at the center line of flow with initialization of ionization and the microwaves or other waves act with the plasma pinch creating electron collisions and electron impact for further ionization with neo classical transport effect<br>
The properties of the material is altered under dynamic conditions or under steady state condition depending upon the materiai Although for a detailed working of the device, a simple configuration with drawing is highlighted, the device could also be made of a straight pipe of any cross section other than hollow circular sections such as a hollow square section or hollow rectangular section or hollow elliptical section, hollow triangle section or hollow hexagon, pentagon or octagon sections or a combination of all hollow sections for varying the field characteristics and modes of propagation of electromagnetic waves and other types of waves and the cut off frequencies depending upon applications and end use.<br>
In certain applications, the heat generated by the device due to microwave radiation, heating of the coil used for magnetization, heat released due to work done by electric fields to rotate polar molecules etc. could also be utilized by the liquid or gas or chemical by covering the major length of the outer pipe (4) by a casing (7) having a fluid flow passage (10) and such arrangement serving as a means for cooling the device from over heating as also for increasing the temperature of fluid flowing through pipe (1) as shown in figure 3.<br>
In certain applications, the wave guide is coupled to a tee joint at the input or at the output end or at both the ends facilitating injection of more than one material into the wave guide or for separation of any gaseous component formed during synthesis within the wave guide and the heat generated by the synthesizer used in conjunction with vacuum to cause fragmentation of certain fluids, hydrocarbons or chemicals to smaller compounds or elements.<br>
It is abundantly clear from the foregoing description that the straight pipe (1) as material carrying media has multi various functions. It acts as a component of cavity resonator. It further acts as a wave-guide. Further the said straight pipe (1) acts as an applicator for transmission of microwaves and other forms and types of waves.<br><br>
Another bigger diameter pipe (outer pipe) (2) and the enclosure pipe (4) acts as cavity resonator. The complete co-axial system with pipe (1), pipe (2) and pipe (4) having the same common axis represent a co-axial resonator for microwaves and any other waves for propagation and resonance and also function as a magnetron, as a cold plasma generator cum plasma accelerator.<br>
The Pipe (1) as envisaged in the invention is either built into the device so as to be part of the synthesizer or a conventional pipe used in the conventional flow line can be readily substituted in place of aforesaid built in pipe (1). The structural arrangements may be incorporated in the synthesizer, which allows the possibilities of using the conventional flow lines for replacement of the pipe (1).<br>
Though the embodiment of the invention as envisaged is described with respect to a material synthesizer, the invention with all its ramifications find acceptance in various areas of applications such as internal combustion engines, outer combustion equipments fluid flow lines, process flow lines of chemical equipments for heating the fluids or as an electronic catalytic convertor for chemical synthesis or in fuel flow lines as an electronic catalytic convertor or as a fuel reformulator and as a heat pump in any heat conversion equipments such as an internal combustion engine, combustion equipment, heat transfer equipments, refrigeration equipments and in the flow lines of exhaust gas of any combustion equipments or in the exhaust gas lines of internal combustion engines for further emission reduction or synthesis of burnt and un burnt chemicals or for excitation of the carbon di oxide, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen molecules in the exhaust gases for synthesis and making the excited exhaust gas suitable for LASER beam generation or in the flow lines of suitable materials for synthesis and making the material suitable for generation or separation of hydrogen from it"s constituents or for obtaining electrical output from the current carrying electron motions .<br>
The device is installed before the engine carburetor, fuel injection system for altering the properties of the hydrocarbon fuel for better combustion efficiency, reduced fuel consumption and lesser emissions either as a separate device in the fluid flow lines or integrated as a component in the assembly of equipments.<br>
This synthesizer is housed in an enclosure with an inlet and an outlet for material flow through it and provided with two wires for energizing it with an electric potential for initialing the novel<br><br>
process during the material flow through it The device excites the molecules and the electrons of the materials contained within it to cause charge transfer necessary for the molecular engineering resulting in any one or all of the following namely change of the molecular structure, bond orientations, bond strength, physical property, chemical property. It has no moving parts and the device is fixed in the material flow line of the process or in the material flow line of a machine either at the input or at the output or in between the flow lines to obtain maximum benefit The device is fitted to any petrol, dksel, gas engines or systems using hydrocarbon fuels very easily without any alterations of the engine in minutes.<br>
The device makes use of some of the properties of matter such as "Electro Negatmty", "Influence of lone Pairs of Atoms", "Strains &amp; Conformation" to change bonding angles of molecules, affinity of oxygen atoms and ionization and separation of Macro Molecules under MHD Influence, Hydrogenation due to Catalysis, dia and Paramagnetic Anisotropy of Macro molecules, magnetic orientation of molecules for altering the molecular properties including activation energy level of the hydrocarbon fuel just before mixing with air for ignition in die engine.<br>
Petrol, Diesel, Kerosene, Lubricating Oil refined from crude oil belong to Alkanes group of hydrocarbons with different boiling points can be used as fuel. The physical and chemical properties of alkanes are a function first of the number of carbon atoms it contains and second of it"s specific structure. The excitation of the fuel in the presence of a suitable catalyst cause Ring Strain and make the alkanes loose a hydrogen atom The hydrogen atoms cause hydrgenolysis of the minute sulphur giving out hydrogen sulphide which again under excited conditions dissociate into hydrogen and sulphur. The hydrogen is absorbed in the metal surface of the catalyst or released as a gas while the sulphur is adsorbed on the metal and semiconductor surface layers of the wave guide and act as a catalyst accelerating the fuel reformulation. The H - H bond is weakened and a reactive hydrogen atom adds to the double bond or to Lone Pairs of atoms. The trace of moisture and additives in the fuels cause Electro negativity which under external field excitation make oxygen also bond with Lone Pairs of Atoms altering the molecular structure of the fuel, it"s physical and chemical properties including Activation Energy Level, volatility, fuel quality. A lean mixture is a definite answer for reduced pollution and fuel economy. A lean mixture burns slowly and yields higher thermal efficiency due to ratio of specific heat approaching that of air and with less dissociation loss due to lower combustion temperature and lower losses to cooling water and air.   However a lean<br><br>
mixture is very difficult to ignite and engines operating with lean mixture require high compression ratio or high-octane fuel The field excitation cause rearrangement of molecular clusters and molecular bonding and the catalyst cause hetrogeneous catalysed gas phase combustion which is an efficient way of burning a lean mixture outside the fkmmabnity limits without forming pollutants-Gas phase ignition of hydrocarbon increase flame velocity and reduce minimum ignition energy. The catalytic surface temperature controls the reaction rate instead of the ambient temperature.<br>
Emission o£ carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon are related to air fuel ratio. In a vehicle fitted with a catalytic converter, die air fuel ratio is around 15:1 or less for less emission whereas with the invented device, the air fuel ratio is above 16:1 to 22:1 depending upon engine condition which results in fuel economy and less emission.<br>
The ability of the engine to start with a lean mixture (with increased air input) reduced fuel consumption and less emission, less engine knocking (smoothness of engine working), less engine temperature are indicative of the physical and chemical property changes of the fuel due to molecular structure change made by the invented device.<br>
It is evident that the device according to invention makes use of various scientific principles as enumerated in the body of the specification The precision of the device is an important criteria to augment the working results and to achieve optimum operating results. The embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawing is to explain the active principles involved in the construction and the operation of the device and the combined or otherwise synergistic effect of various active principles and components in the said device.<br>

For application as a laser beam generator, the center pipe (1) is removed in Fig.3 and the engine exhaust flows through passage fluid (10) and through the end bush (6) center hole, die gas enters the cavity of pipe (2) wherein the carbon di oxide and nitrogen oxide molecules are excited by the electromagnetic waves resulting in population inversion and emission of light. The inside of die bushes (6) will be coated with reflective coatings to facilitate reflections of die beam widiin die<br><br>
cavity. The bush at one end of pipe (2) will have a concave reflective shape while the bush (6) at the opposite end will have converging lens shape for pointing the reflected beam out of the synthesizer.<br>
