Descri pition<br>
Method and mobile communication appliance for selecting a<br>
transmission path<br>
The invention relates to a method for a mobile communication<br>
appliance in accordance with the precharacterizing part of<br>
patent claim 1 and to a communication terminal for wirelessly<br>
accossing a plurality of transmission paths in accordance with<br>
the procha racterizing part of patent claim 10.<br>
There are frequently various radio-based voice networks and<br>
data networks available for mobile communication links. In this<br>
context, the radio-based voice networks, that is to say GSM<br>
networks, DECT networks and UMTS networks, for example, can<br>
also be used for data transmission, as can, conversely, radio-<br>
based data networks, that is to say WLAN networks, WiMax<br>
networks and Bluetooth networks, for example, can also be used<br>
for voice transmission (e.g. VoIP - Voice Over Internet<br>
Prolocol).<br>
While, in many cases, the same requirement (voice transmission,<br>
data transmission etc.) can thus be met in the same or a<br>
similar quality using different types of mobile networks and<br>
hence using different transmission paths, these transmission<br>
paths differ, however, in terms of the costs respectively<br>
related to their use, in terms of their bandwidth, the delay<br>
times, there reliability (connections being cut off) etc .<br>
To be able to take hold in a specific situation between<br>
different transmission paths and their respective related<br>
advantages and drawbacks as required, what are known as<br>
multimodal mobile communication appliances are frequently used.<br>
By way of example, these are PCs which have both Bluetooth and<br><br>
WLAN transmission devices, or else mobile radios (telephones)<br>
which selectively support connections <br><br><br>
based on t;he GSM standard, the UMTS standard and/or the DECT<br>
standard. Before setting up a communication link, for example a<br>
telephone call, a user of such a communication appliance can<br>
thus select the transmission path which is to be used for the<br>
next communication link. Alternatively, it is also possible to<br>
permanently preset different transmission paths (GSM, GPRS,<br>
DECT) for different communication services (voice, fax, SMS,<br>
Internet. WWW, etc.).<br>
Frequently, a transmission path is also selected automatically<br>
by the communication appliances by checking the availability of<br>
the various transmission paths at the time at which a<br>
communication link is initiated. To this end, by way of<br>
example, a field strength measurement is used to check whether<br>
the various base stations of different transmission paths (for<br>
example DECT, WLAN) can be received. If it is available, the<br>
(inexpensive) WLAN network is then selected, for example, using<br>
a priority list, whereas a GSM mobile radio Jink is selected as<br>
the transmission path if a WLAN network or a DECT cell is not<br>
available .<br>
The document US 2004/0242240 A1 Lin "Location Assisted<br>
Communications Mode Switching" discloses a method in which<br>
multimodal terminals take their geographical position as a<br>
basis for reading a preferred communication mode from a table<br>
and, if the terminal is in another communication mode, changing<br>
to this selected communication mode. This process is repeated<br>
aL regular intervals of time .<br>
The document US 5,752., 164 Jones "Autonomous Remote Measurement<br>
Unit for Personal Communications Service System" discloses a<br>
method for a communication network, in which different<br>
frequency channels of a wide frequency band can be used<br>
alternately for communication. In this case, the area in which<br>
the communication system is used is divided into a number of<br><br>
honeycomb-like regions, with interference on or use of the<br>
individual radio channels being measured for each region by<br>
means of measuring devices provided in each honeycomb and being<br>
stored in a central database. These measurements are preferably<br>
taken repeatedly and used to maintain the data base formed<br>
thereby. When a mobile terminal is used, position-finding is<br>
performed for this terminal, and access to the database is used<br>
to establish which radio channels are free or have little<br>
interference, so that a free or low-interference radio channel<br>
can be used for communication.<br>
The document US 5,974,328 Lee et al. "Rapid System Access and<br>
Registration in Mobile Phone Systems" likewise discloses a<br>
database-based method for location-dependent configuration of a<br>
mobile terminal. In this case, a mobile terminal is supplied<br>
with respective optimized registration parameters for<br>
registration in a mobile radio network from a database on the<br>
basis of location.<br>
In the case of the known methods and devices for selecting one<br>
of a plurality of transmission paths, it is found to be<br>
d:i sadvan tageous that the selected transmission path in many<br>
cases docs not assure the required transmission quality, and/or<br>
al though a high-quality transmission path is selected it is in<br>
many cases unnecessarily expensive. It is therefore an object<br>
of the present invention to improve the selection of a<br>
respective transmission path used when mobile communication<br>
appliance sare used.<br>
The object is achieved by a method in accordance with patent<br>
claim 1 and by a communication appliance in accordance with<br>
patent claim 10 .<br><br>
The object is achieved by using a method for selecting a<br>
transmission path for a communication link. from a mobile<br>
communication appliance, where the mobile communication<br>
appliance can select at least two transmission paths. In this<br>
context, a first step involves a statement about the location<br>
of the communication appliance being ascertained,<br>
a second step involves the ascertained statement being used to<br>
access a database for transmission paths,<br>
a third step involves at least one entry in the database being<br>
used to determine a preferred transmission path, and<br>
a fourth step involves the preferred transmission path being<br>
selected and being used for a communication link. The use of<br>
this method allows location-dependent selection of the<br>
transmission path, with the entry in the database being able to<br>
be used to prescribe various preferred transmission paths for<br>
various locations. To this end, statistical statements about<br>
previous uses of at least one of the transmission paths are<br>
used for the database, where at least one correlation between a<br>
statement about the location used during a previous use and a<br>
statement, picked up during the previous use, about the quality<br>
of the transmission path used is stored and used to select the<br>
transmission path. An "empirical database" of this kind means<br>
that if is possible to dispense with the use of a particular<br>
transmission path at a location at which this transmission path<br>
is known (from experience) to have frequent interference.<br>
The object is also achieved by proposing a communication<br>
appliance for wirelessly accessing a plurality of transmission<br>
paths, one of the plurality of transmission paths being able to<br>
be selected for a communication link. In this context, the<br>
communication appliance is equipped with a position-finding<br>
device for ascertaining a statement about a geographical<br>
position of the communication appliance, and the communication<br>
appliance is equipped for accessing a database, the database<br>
having at least one entry with a statement, based on empirical<br><br>
values from past, communication links, about a quality which can<br>
be expected for one of the transmission paths with at least one<br>
associated statement about a location. In addition, the<br>
communication appliance is equipped with a selection device for<br>
one of the plurality of transmission paths, the selection<br>
device being in a form such that the statement; about the<br>
location and the at least one database entry are used to select<br>
and use a transmission path which corresponds to a minimum<br>
qualify requirement. Such a communication appliance is always<br>
used to select that transmission path which, empirically,<br><br>
meets a proscribed minimum quality requirement for the location<br>
of the communication appliance. This means that it is always<br>
possible to select a transmission path which, although it is<br>
powerful enough, permits the most inexpensive and/or power-saving mode of operation possible for the communication<br>
appliance. To this end, a user advantageously defines various<br>
criteria as aims, for example cost criteria, energy criteria,<br>
time criteria (duration of connection setup, transmission time<br>
for a particular volume of data, delay times etc.) .<br>
Advantageous refinements of the inventive method are	specified<br>
in patent claims 2 to 9. The features and advantages	described<br>
therein also apply mutatis mutandis to the inventive<br>
communication appliance.<br>
In this case, the database may be stored in the communication<br>
appliance itself, which means that access to the database is<br>
particularly rapid and simple, and it is a simple matter to<br>
prevent manipulation of the database by third parties. On the<br>
other hand, a database which is available centrally in a<br>
communication network may also be used for this purpose, which<br>
means that a communication appliance can also use the empirical<br>
values and rules (routing rules) from other communication<br>
appliances. Finally, the parallel use of both a local and a<br>
central database is also advantageous in many cases, because it<br>
firstly allows redundancy requirements to be met, and secondly<br><br>
allows "one's own" entries to be used preferably, in order to<br>
be able to resort to the centrally stored entries if such<br>
entries "of one's own" are not present.<br>
The structure of radio networks and their locally differing<br>
reception circumstances and also the time-variant utilization<br>
level of transmission paths can easily be taken into account by<br>
virtue of use of the selected transmission path being followed<br>
by a qualify registered in the process for the transmission<br>
path and the staternent about the location being used by the<br>
communication appliance for a fresh entry in the database<br>
and/or for correcting an existing entry in the database. In<br>
this context, the quality stored and taken into account may<br>
advantageously be a combination of individual criteria, e.g.<br>
costs, bandwidths, reliabilities (for example number of<br>
connect ions cut. off per unit time), delay times (for example in<br>
the case of VolP links) etc.<br>
The data obtained through the continuous and automatic "care"<br>
of the entries in the database may advantageously also be used<br>
for optimizing a radio network to which an associated<br>
transmission path belongs. It is therefore possible in many<br>
cases to dispense with the separate measurement of radio areas<br>
and nevertheless to obtain a constantly up-to-date overview of<br>
radio ranges, "radio holes", field strength distributions or<br>
the like. In this case, it is also possible for a central<br>
location (for example a system administrator) to make changes<br>
in the data records in the database such that future selection<br>
decisions are influenced. This makes it possible to control the<br>
utilization level of individual connecting paths and to avoid<br>
bottle necks .<br>
If a time statement about the time and/or the time of day<br>
and/or a day-of-week statement is used to select the<br>
transmission path, the database providing statistical<br>
statements about the quality of at least one transmission path<br><br>
for a particular time and/or Lime of day and/or day of the<br>
week,	<br><br><br>
iL is also possible to take account of changes on the<br>
transmission paths which are recurrent on the basis of time. By-<br>
way of example, this involves taking account of cases in which<br>
particular transmission paths (for example a company WLAN) have<br>
a high utilization level at particular times of day (for<br>
example during normal business hours) and therefore provide<br>
reduced bandwidth .<br>
Manual input of location information into a communication<br>
appliance is avoided if the statement about the location of the<br>
communication appliance is ascertained using a<br>
satellite-assisted position-finding system (e.g. "GPS") and/or<br>
a method for position-finding using received terrestrial radio<br>
base stations (field strength and/or propagation-time<br>
measurements) .<br>
The inventive method can be used particularly flexibly and<br>
often universally if a WLAN radio network, a GSM mobile radio<br>
network and/or a UMTS voice data radio network is selected for<br>
the transmission path. Accessing these widespread transmission<br>
paths means that there is a high likelihood of one or even more<br>
transmission paths always being available for selection.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the inventive method are explained<br>
below with reference to the drawing. They are simultaneously<br>
used to explain a communication appliance based on the<br>
invention .<br>
In this context, the single figure uses a schematic<br>
illustration to show a control device ("Gall Processing"), a<br>
selection device and access units ("Connectors") for a<br>
communication appliance.<br>
The figure shows a schematic illustration of components of a<br>
mobile communication appliance. In this case, the mobile<br><br>
communication appliance is what is known as a "smart phone",<br>
that is to say an appliance in which the functions of a mobile<br><br>
computer ("PDA" - Personal Digital Assistant) and the functions<br>
of a mobile radio (mobile telephone) arc combined with one<br>
another. The communication appliance is in multimodal form,<br>
that is to say has access units K (connectors) for various<br>
radio networks,, in this case GSM, WLAN, Bluetooth, WiMax, UMTS,<br>
etc. in addition, the communication appliance also has access<br>
units K for wired communication; for this, the figure shows an<br>
Ethernet access unit by way of example.<br>
The text below-unless a different description is<br>
given - simply assumes that each access unit K is associated<br>
with precisely one transmission method (GSM, internet Protocol,<br>
ISDN...), which means that the access units K in the figure<br>
simultaneously represent transmission methods. In this case, a<br>
transmission method can be used to access a plurality of<br>
transmission paths; by way of example, a single GSM connector<br>
can be used to access a plurality of mobile radio networks<br>
(even with different network operators) and a single LAN port<br>
can be used to access different VolP gateways/gatekeepers or<br>
the like. For reasons of further simplification, it is<br>
subsequently also assumed that each access unit K has not only<br>
precisely one associated transmission method but also precisely<br>
one associated transmission path, which means that the<br>
reference symbols for the access units K simultaneously denote<br>
transmission methods and finally transmission paths.<br>
The communication appliance also has a control device CP ("Call<br>
Processing") which the applications (not shown) on the<br>
communication appliance use as a control device and as an<br>
interface tor external communication. In the present exemplary<br>
embodiment, the control device CP is a call processing unit for<br>
switching voice links, as is known from circuit-switched<br>
communication installations ("PBX"). Generally, however, it is<br>
also possible to use any other control device, for example,<br>
VolP gatekeepers, e-mail distribution devices etc. or else<br>
multifunctional control devices for<br><br>
switching different data types and communication streams.<br>
Whereas "conventional" monomodal 'communication appliances<br>
regularly involve the control device CP communicating only with<br>
a single access unit K, the control device CP in the present<br>
exemplary embodiment uses a selection device At; to access<br>
different access units K. To this end, the control device CP is<br>
in a form such that it sets up a communication 1ink or a data<br>
channel to the selection device AE by transmitting not only a<br>
communication address (telephone number, IP address or the<br>
like) but also a statement about a quality requirement.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, the statement about the<br>
quality requirement comprises a plurality of criteria. First,<br>
the control device CP uses internal signaling to notify the<br>
selection device All of a type (type statement) for the next<br>
communication link on the basis of the application which<br>
requires the communication Link (or data channel or the like).<br>
That is to say that for voice links, for example, there is<br>
different signaling than for the transmission of an e-mail,<br>
message or an SMS message. In the case data applications<br>
(internet access or the like), it is also possible for a<br>
desired minimum bandwidth (for example 128 kbit/s) to be<br>
requested which is ascertained automatically or is input by a<br>
user.<br>
From the point of view of the control device CP, the selection<br>
device AM works Like a - single - access unit K. The selection<br>
de vice. All therefore "conceals" the peculiarities of the<br>
individual access units K which are actually present. It is<br>
therefore also possible and advantageous for only an abstract<br>
descriptor (e.g. the name) for the desired call party to be<br>
transmitted from the control, device CP to the selection device<br>
AE instead of a specific communication address (telephone<br>
number, IP address) . The subsequently<br><br>
selected - transmission path and transmission method (and hence<br>
the access unit K to be used) are then used to retrieve the<br>
"appropriate" communication address from an address directory<br>
(preferably likewise stored in the database DB). It is<br>
therefore possible to change the transmission path and<br>
transmission method even during an ongoing call, for example<br>
from a VoIP link (with an IP address as communication address)<br>
to an ISDN link (with a "conventional" telephone number as<br>
communication address) .<br>
The selection device AE and the control device CP access a<br>
common database DB (empirical database), this database DB being<br>
integrated in the communication appliance DB in the present<br>
exemplary embodiment. As an alternative or in addition, it is<br>
naturally possible to use a network-assisted, central database<br>
DB for use by a plurality of communication appliances.<br>
In another a1ternative refinement, it is a1so possible for<br>
different communication appliances to reciprocally access the<br>
databases on other communication appliances and to use the<br>
entries they contain for selecting an access unit K and hence a<br>
particular transmission path.<br>
The text below describes the setup of a communication link by a<br>
communication appliance having the technical devices described<br>
above. To this end, the communication appliance has a technical<br>
device, a position-finding device which assures at least coarse<br>
geographical position-finding for the communication appliance.<br>
In the prescnt exemplary embodiment, this is done by detecting<br>
the identification numbers ("base station IDs") of the various<br>
radio cells in whose reception area the communication appliance<br>
is currently active. The identification numbers and the<br>
reception field strengths of the respective radio cells are<br>
reported to the selection device AE by the various<br><br>
access units K at regular intervals of time. From the<br>
statements from the various access units K, the selection<br>
device AE creates an up-to-date location profile.<br>
Alternatively, position-finding is also possible using a<br>
satellite-assisted system, for example GPS. Finally, in cases<br>
in which up-to-date position-finding is not possible, a<br>
"default, location" can be prescribed for different times of day<br>
(e.g. week days between 12.00 and 16.00 hours: in the office<br>
having the coordinates xy).<br>
Preferably - as described below - a routing decision is made<br>
primarily on the basis of the current Location and secondarily<br>
on the basis of other requirements. Alternatively, a<br>
distinction can also be drawn primarily on the basis of the<br>
type of user or use (private/business etc.), or cost or quality<br>
features are considered first. These settings can be influenced<br>
either by users or by an administrator, according to an<br>
authorization model.<br>
It is subsequently assumed that a communication application is<br>
to be used to set up a video telephony link. To this end, the<br>
application with the task of doing so sends the control device<br>
CP a request message which transmits not only the type of<br>
communication link required (in this case: "real-time stream")<br>
but also a desired bandwidth (in this case: 192 kbit/s full<br>
duplex) and an associated qualify class (in this case: best<br>
qualify no connections being cut off if possible and little<br>
delay). On the basis of the requirements given, the selection<br>
device All decides that only some of the available transmission<br>
paths and hence certain access units K are suitable for the<br>
communication link required, namely Ethernet, WLAN, WiMax and<br>
UMTS. To make this decision, the selection device AF, loads a<br>
data record, describing the basic performance of the relevant<br>
access unit K and of the transmission path linked to it at the<br>
current location,<br><br>
from the database DB at least once for each available access<br>
unit K.<br>
The selection device AE now ascertains tho current availability<br>
of the previously selected access units K and hence of the<br>
transmission paths selected with them. This establishes that<br>
the access unit "Ethernet" is currently not available, that is<br>
to say that no Ethernet network port is connected or active.<br>
Of the remaining access units K, the two WLAN access units<br>
(2.4 Gil/.; 5 GHz), the WiMax transmission path and the UMTS<br>
radio module are suitable for meeting the requirements<br>
transmitted with the request message.<br>
The selection device AE therefore accesses the database DB<br>
again and loads a respective cost table for the suitable access<br>
units K in order to select, the cheapest, transmission path and<br>
hence the most suited access unit K according to the situation.<br>
In this context, it is optionally also possible to select the<br>
cheapest "provider" if an access unit K and hence a<br>
transmission method have a plurality of providers (service<br>
providers) and hence a plurality of transmission paths<br>
availiable (for example a p1urality of GSM networks are<br>
available).<br>
When the selection device AE has decided to use a particular<br>
access unit K (in this case the cheap 2.4 GHz WLAN is used),<br>
the desired connection is set up and the selection device<br>
awards the control device CP what, is known as a "quality<br>
monitoring order". On the basis of the "quality monitoring<br>
order", the control device CP transmits a quality message,<br>
which is known as "feedback", which is also known as a "QoS<br>
(Quality of Service) data collection (QDC)", when the<br>
communication link previously set up has been terminated. With<br>
this quality message, the selection device AE<br><br>
receives statements about any connections which may have been<br>
cut off, the average, minimum and maximum transmission<br>
bandwidth and, if available, statements about the costs<br>
incurred. Together with the already available statement about<br>
the current location, the selection device AE uses these data<br>
to update the database DB, with a new data record first of all<br>
being created. Already available empirical values about the<br>
location and about the transmission path used may alternatively<br>
or additionally involve an existing data record being updated.<br>
When existing data records are updated, a filter algorithm<br>
ensures that "outliers", for example, a single instance of a<br>
connection being cut off, do not result in the affected<br>
transmission path no longer being selected Long term. At the<br>
same time, the filter algorithm ensures that "more recent"<br>
qualify statements are given a higher weighting than statements<br>
from longer ago; thi s relates particularly also to cost<br>
statements, because providers are frequently changing the costs<br>
for their services. Slatislical methods can thus be used to<br>
compile a plurality of data records.<br>
In this case, the database DB has an optional interface to a<br>
network management system (not shown). Such network management<br>
systems allow an overview to be obtained about data<br>
infrastructures and in so doing are used for error searches and<br>
network planning. The QoS statements "automatically"<br>
ascertained when communication links are used and hence when<br>
transmission paths are used are - as described - used for<br>
constantly updating the database DB, so that the information in<br>
the database DB can be used as a replacement for complex<br>
separate network measurements.<br>
Particularly in the case of configurations in which both local<br>
and central databases are used, regular alignment of the local<br>
databases and the central database allows a central stock of<br>
data to be set up and maintained which, by means of targeted<br>
evaluation, identifies infrastructure<br><br>
defects. Changes to the entries to the databases, for example<br>
by an administrator, then allow the "behavior" of communication<br>
appliances to be influenced, for example so that connecting<br>
paths with a low utilization level are preferred. The alignment<br>
described means that an entry at a central location, that is to<br>
say in a central database, is then sufficient even when local<br>
databases are used. <br><br><br>
