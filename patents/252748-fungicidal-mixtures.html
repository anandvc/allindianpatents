Description<br>
5 The present invention relates to fungicidal mixtures comprising<br>
(1) triticonazole of the formula I<br><br>
or salts or adducts thereof<br>
and<br>
(2) pyraclostrobin of the formula II<br><br>
and<br>
(3) at least one acylalanine selected from the group consisting of metalaxyl-M of the<br>
formula III<br><br><br>
in a synergistically effective amount.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a method for controlling harmful fungi using mixtures<br>
of the compounds I to III, to the use of the compounds I to III for preparing such<br>
mixtures and to compositions comprising these mixtures.<br>
Triticonazole of the formula I is described in EP-A 0 378 953.<br>
Pyraclostrobin of the formula II is known from EP-A 0 804 421.<br>
Metalaxyl-M of the formula III is described in WO 96/01559.<br>
Kiralaxyl of the formula IV is known from WO 00/76960.<br>
Moreover, mixtures of triticonazole of the formula I with other fungicides are known<br>
from WO 98/54969.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, with a view to reducing the application rates and<br>
broadening the activity spectrum of the known compounds I to IV, to provide mixtures<br>
which, at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied, have improved activity<br>
against harmful fungi (synergistic mixtures).<br><br><br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixture of triticonazole,<br>
pyraclostrobin and metalaxyl-M or kiralaxyl defined at the outset. Moreover, we have<br>
found that simultaneous, that is joint or separate, application of the compounds I to III<br>
or I, II and IV or successive application of the compounds I to III or I, II and IV allows<br>
better control of harmful fungi than is possible with the individual compounds.<br><br><br><br>
is described in WO 00/76960.<br>
Owing to the basic character of its nitrogen atoms, the compound I is capable of<br>
forming salts or adducts with inorganic or organic acids and with metal ions,<br>
respectively.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen<br>
chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and<br>
nitric acid.<br>
Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid, carbonic acid, and alkanoic acids,<br>
such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also<br>
glycolic acid, thiocyanic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid,<br>
cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acids (sulfonic acids having straight-chain or<br>
branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulfonic acids or aryldisulfonic<br>
acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two sulfonic<br>
acid groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or<br>
branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or<br>
aryldiphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry<br>
one or two phosphoric acid groups), where the alkyl or aryl radicals may carry further<br>
substituents, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-<br>
phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, etc.<br>
Suitable metal ions are in particular the ions of the elements of the second main group,<br>
in particular calcium and magnesium, of the third and fourth main group, in particular<br>
aluminum, tin and lead and also of the elements of transition groups one to eight, in<br>
particular chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and others.<br>
Particular preference is given to the metal ions of the elements of transition groups of<br>
the fourth period. The metals can be present in the various valencies that they can<br>
assume.<br><br>
In many crops, dressing with fungicides delays or reduces emergence and results in a<br>
poorer establishment of the stand when the cultivation is started.<br>
The mixtures of the compounds I to III or I, II and IV, or the simultaneous, that is joint or<br>
separate, use of one of the compounds I to IV, are/is distinguished in that these<br>
negative effects on the plants which, depending on the dosage, may also occur with<br>
triticonazole or pyraclostrobin, both when applied on their own and when applied as the<br>
2-component mixture with III or IV, do not occur, or are not as pronounced. In addition,<br>
the mixtures have excellent activity against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi,<br>
in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Deuteromycetes<br>
and Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes). Some of them are systemically active and<br>
can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, as fungicides for seed dressing and<br>
as soil fungicides.<br>
They are particularly important for controlling a multitude of fungi on various cultivated<br>
plants, such as bananas, cotton, vegetable species (for example cucumbers, beans,<br>
tomatoes and cucurbits), barley, grass, oats, coffee, potatoes, corn, fruit species, rice,<br>
rye, soybeans, grapevines, wheat, ornamental plants, sugar cane and also on a large<br>
number of seeds.<br>
They are especially suitable for controlling the following plant diseases:<br>

-	Puccinia species on cereals and corn,<br>
-	Pyrenophora species on cereals,<br>
-	Pyricularia oryzae, Corticium sasakii, Sarocladium oryzae, S. attenuatum, Entyloma<br>
oryzae on rice,<br>

-	Tilletia species on cereals,<br>
-	Ustilago species on cereals, corn and sugar beet, and<br>
-	Venturia species (scab) on apples and pears.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are also suitable for controlling harmful fungi<br>
such as Paecilomyces variotii in the protection of materials (for example wood, paper,<br>
paint dispersions, fibers or fabrics) and in the protection of stored products.<br>
The compounds I to III or I, II and IV can be applied simultaneously, that is jointly or<br>
separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application,<br>
generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active compounds I to<br>
III or I, II and IV, to which further active compounds against harmful fungi or against<br>
other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-<br>
regulating active compounds or fertilizers can be added according to need.<br>
Usually, mixtures of the compounds I to III or I, II and IV are employed. However, in<br>
certain cases mixtures of the compounds I to III or I, II and IV with, if appropriate, a<br>
plurality of active components may be advantageous, such as, for example, mixtures of<br><br>
the compounds I to III with the compound IV or further fungicides or mixtures of the<br>
compounds I, II and IV with further fungicides.<br>
The mixing ratio (weight ratio) of the compounds I, II and III or IV is chosen such that a<br>
synergistic fungicidal action occurs, for example compound I: compound II: compound<br>
III or compound IV such as 100 to 1 : 100 to 1 : 100 to 1, in particular 10 to 1 : 10 to 1 :<br>
10 to 1, for example 5 to 1 : 5 to 1 : 5 to 1, in particular 3 to 1 : 3 to 1 : 3 to 1, preferably<br>
2 to 1 : 2 to 1 : 2 to 1. The mixing ratio includes, for example, the mixtures I: II: III or IV<br>
such as 100 : 1 : 1 to 1 : 100 : 1 to 1 : 1 : 100. The synergistic action of the mixture<br>
manifests itself in that the fungicidal action of the mixture I + II + III or IV is greater than<br>
the sum of the fungicidal actions of I and of II and of III or IV.<br>
The further active components are, if desired, added in a ratio of from 20:1 to 1:20 to<br>
the compounds I to III or I, II and IV.<br>
Depending on the type of compound and the desired effect, the application rates of the<br>
mixtures according to the invention are, especially in the case of areas under<br>
agricultural cultivation, from 5 g/ha to 2000 g/ha, preferably from 20 to 900 g/ha, in<br>
particular from 50 to 750 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for the compound I are generally from 1 to 1000<br>
g/ha, preferably from 10 to 900 g/ha, in particular from 20 to 750 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for the active compound II are generally from 1<br>
to 1000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 900 g/ha, in particular from 40 to 750 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for the active compound III or IV are generally<br>
from 1 to 1000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 900 g/ha, in particular from 40 to 750 g/ha.<br>
In the treatment of seed, application rates of mixture are generally from 1 to<br>
1000 g/100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 to 750 g/100 kg, in particular from 5 to<br>
500g/100kg.<br>
The method for controlling harmful fungi is carried out by the separate or joint<br>
application of the compounds I to III or I, II and IV or a mixture of the compounds I to III<br>
or I, II and IV by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soil before or after<br>
sowing of the plants or before or after emergence of the plants.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention, or the compounds I to III or I, II and IV can be<br>
converted into the customary formulations, for example solutions, emulsions,<br>
suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form depends on the<br><br>
particular intended purpose; in each case, it should ensure a fine and even distribution<br>
of the compound according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by extending the active<br>
compound with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
Solvents/auxiliaries suitable for this purpose are essentially:<br>
- water, aromatic solvents (for example Solvesso products, xylene), paraffins (for<br>
example mineral oil fractions), alcohols (for example methanol, butanol, pentanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol), ketones (for example cyclohexanone, gamma-butyrolactone),<br>
pyrrolidones (NMP, NOP), acetates (glycol diacetate), glycols, fatty acid<br>
dimethylamides, fatty acids and fatty acid esters. In principle, solvent mixtures may<br>
also be used,<br>
carriers such as ground natural minerals (for example kaolins, clays, talc, chalk)<br>
and ground synthetic minerals (for example highly disperse silica, silicates);<br>
emulsifiers such as nonionogenic and anionic emulsifiers (for example<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and<br>
dispersants such as lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Suitable for use as surfactants are alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium<br>
salts of lignosulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, phenolsulfonic acid,<br>
dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkylsulfonates, fatty<br>
alcohol sulfates, fatty acids and sulfated fatty alcohol glycol ethers, furthermore<br>
condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and naphthalene derivatives with<br>
formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of naphthalenesulfonic acid with phenol<br>
and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctylphenol,<br>

ethanol, propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, isophorone, highly polar<br>
solvents, for example dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dustable products can be prepared by mixing or<br>
concomitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br><br>
Granules, for example coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous<br>
granules, can be prepared by binding the active compounds to solid carriers. Examples<br>
of solid carriers are mineral earths such as silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, attaclay,<br>
limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate,<br>
magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers, such as,<br>
for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and<br>
products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and<br>
nutshell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 90% by weight, of the active compounds. The active compounds are employed in a<br>
purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The following are examples of formulations: 1. Products for dilution with water<br>
A)	Water-soluble concentrates (SL)<br>
10 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 90 parts<br>
by weight of water or of a water-soluble solvent. As an alternative, wetting agents or<br>
other auxiliaries are added. The active compound dissolves upon dilution with water.<br>
This gives a formulation having an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
B)	Dispersible concentrates (DC)<br>
20 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 70 parts<br>
by weight of cyclohexanone with addition of 10 parts by weight of dispersant, for<br>
example polyvinylpyrrolidone. Dilution with water gives a dispersion. The active<br>
compound content is 20% by weight.<br>
C)	Emulsifiable concentrates (EC)<br>
15 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 75 parts<br>
by weight of xylene with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil<br>
ethoxylate (in each case 5 parts by weight). Dilution with water gives an emulsion. The<br>
formulation has an active compound content of 15% by weight.<br>
D)	Emulsions (EW, EO)<br>
25 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 35 parts<br>
by weight of xylene with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil<br>
ethoxylate (in each case 5 parts by weight). This mixture is introduced into 30 parts by<br>
weight of water by means of an emulsifying machine (e.g. Ultraturrax) and made into a<br>
homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an emulsion. The formulation has an<br>
active compound content of 25% by weight.<br><br>
E)	Suspensions (SC, OD)<br>
In an agitated ball mill, 20 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are<br>
comminuted with addition of 10 parts by weight of dispersants and wetting agents and<br>
70 parts by weight of water or an organic solvent to give a fine active compound<br>
suspension. Dilution with water gives a stable suspension of the active compound. The<br>
active compound content in the formulation is 20% by weight.<br>
F)	Water-dispersible granules and water-soluble granules (WG, SG)<br>
50 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are ground finely with<br>
addition of 50 parts by weight of dispersants and wetting agents and prepared as<br>
water-dispersible or water-soluble granules by means of technical appliances (for<br>
example extrusion, spray tower, fluidized bed). Dilution with water gives a stable<br>
dispersion or solution of the active compound. The formulation has an active<br>
compound content of 50% by weight.<br>
G)	Water-dispersible powders and water-soluble powders (WP, SP)<br>
75 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are ground in a rotor-<br>
stator mill with addition of 25 parts by weight of dispersants, wetting agents and silica<br>
gel. Dilution with water gives a stable dispersion or solution of the active compound.<br>
The active compound content of the formulation is 75% by weight.<br>
2. Products to be applied undiluted<br>
H) Dustable powders (DP)<br>
5 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are ground finely and<br>
mixed intimately with 95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable<br>
product having an active compound content of 5% by weight.<br>
J) Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of a compound according to the invention is ground finely and<br>
associated with 99.5 parts by weight of carriers. Current methods are extrusion, spray-<br>
drying or the fluidized bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted having an active<br>
compound content of 0.5% by weight.<br>
K) ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in 90 parts<br>
by weight of an organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied<br>
undiluted having an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable<br><br>
products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing,<br>
dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the intended<br>
purposes; they are intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of<br>
the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier.<br>
However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance,<br>
wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such<br>
concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from<br>
0.01 to1%.<br>
The active compounds may also be used successfully in the ultra-iow-volume process<br>
(ULV), it being possible thereby to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight<br>
of active compound, or even to apply the active compound without additives.<br>
Oils of various types, wetters, adjuvants may be added to the active compounds, even,<br>
if appropriate, not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents are typically<br>
admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of from<br>
1:100 to 100:1, preferably from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The compounds I to III or I, II and IV or the mixtures or the corresponding formulations<br>
are applied by treating the harmful fungi, the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or<br>
spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture or,<br>
in the case of separate application, with the compounds I to III or I, II and IV.<br>
Application can be carried out before or after infection by the harmful fungi.<br>
The fungicidal effect of the individual compounds and the mixtures according to the<br>
invention was demonstrated by the following tests:<br>
The active compounds were prepared separately or jointly as a stock solution with<br>
25 mg of active compound which was made up to 10 ml using a mixture of acetone<br>
and/or DMSO and the emulsifier Uniperol® EL (wetting agent having emulsifying and<br>
dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) in a volume ratio of<br>
solvent/emulsifier of 99 to 1. The mixture was then made up with water to 100 ml. This<br>
stock solution was diluted with the solvent/emulsifier/water mixture described to the<br>
concentration of active compounds stated below.<br><br>
The visually determined percentages of infected leaf areas were converted into<br>
efficacies in % of the untreated control:<br>
The efficacy (E) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br>
E = (1-α/)-100<br>
a corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the treated plants in % and<br>
3 corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that<br>
of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were<br>
not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of mixtures of active compounds were determined using<br>
Colby's formula (Colby, S.R. "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of<br>
herbicide combinations", Weeds, 15, pp. 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed<br>
efficacies.<br>
Colby's formula:<br>
E = x + y-xy/100<br>
E expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the<br>
mixture of the active compounds A and B at the concentrations a and b<br>
x efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active<br>
compound A at the concentration a<br>
y efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active<br>
compound B at the concentration b<br>
Use example<br>
Seed treatment of Bentgrass<br>
Seeds of bentgrass were seed-treated with the products and concentrations listed.<br>
Triticonazol and Pyraclstrobin were used as 200g/l FS-formulation. Metalaxyl-M als a 17.7<br>
% LS-formulation.<br>
Treated seeds were planted at the day of treatment and then kept under humid conditions<br>
in the greenhouse. 7 days after plating the ground coverage by emerged plants were<br>
estimated in percentage.<br><br><br>
The data show that the negative effect of the mixture of TTZ and Pyraclostrobin can be<br>
over compensated by Metalaxyl-M.<br>
We claim:<br>
1. A fungicidal mixture, comprising<br>
5	(1) triticonazole of the formula I<br><br>
or salts or adducts with metal ions thereof;<br>
10	and<br>
