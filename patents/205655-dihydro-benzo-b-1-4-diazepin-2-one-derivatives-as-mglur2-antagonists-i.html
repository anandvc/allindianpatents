It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br><br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor,<br>
L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGIuRl and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group II can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br>

The compounds of formula I can also be used in form of their prodrugs. Examples are esters, N-oxides, phosphate esters, glycoamide esters, glyceride conjugates and the like. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compounds advantages in absorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>

According to scheme A, compounds of general formula I, in which Y, R1, R2 and R3 are as described above, can be prepared from compounds of general formula II via an acylation-deprotection-cyclization sequence:<br>
For example reacting compounds of general formula II with a dioxinone IV, in which Y and R are as described above, in an inert solvent such as toluene or xylene at elevated temperatures, preferably between 80 Â°C and 160 Â°C gives rise to compounds of general formula III.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula III can also be prepared by for example reaction of a compound of general formula II with a p-ketoester (general formula IVa), in which Y and R3 are as described above using the same conditions as described for the reaction with the dioxinones.<br>
Afterwards, cleaving the BOC protecting group in compounds of general formula III and concomitant cyclization of the deprotected compound yields the desired compounds of general formula I. Any other suitable amino protecting group, such as e.g. Fmoc or benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), can be alternatively used instead of the BOC group.<br>
The deprotection-cyclization step can be carried out by treating the compounds of general formula III with for example a Bronsted acid such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 0 Â°C and 50 Â°C. It maybe advantageous to use also anisole or 1,3-dimethoxybenzene as a carbocation scavenger in the reaction mixture.<br><br><br>
In addition, compounds of general formula I, in which Y, Rl, R2 and R3 are as described above, can be prepared according to scheme B, by for example reducing the nitro group in compounds of general formula V to the amino group and subsequent heating of the reaction mixture to achieve the cyclization. The reduction can for example be carried out using hydrogen gas in presence of a suitable catalyst like for example Raney-Nickel. Other possible reduction methods are using tin(II)chloride (SnCl2.2H2O) in ethanol at temperatures between 70 Â°C and 80 Â°C, iron-powder and acetic acid in mixtures of THF, water and ethanol at temperatures between 50 Â°C and 80 Â°C, and also zinc-powder in the presence of ammonium chloride at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 80 Â°C. The exact conditions for the respective compounds of general formula I can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Compounds of general formula V, in which Y,R ,R andR are as described above, can be prepared according to scheme B by for example reacting a compound of general formula VI, with a dioxinone (general formula IV) in an inert solvent like for example toluene or xylene at elevated temperatures, preferably between 80 Â°C and 160<br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula II, in which R1 and R2 are as described above, can be prepared according to scheme C by reducing the nitro group in compounds of general formula VII, in which R1 and R2 are as described above, to the amino group. The reduction can for example be carried out using hydrogen gas in presence of a suitable catalyst like for example Raney-Nickel or Palladium on carbon. Another possible reduction method is using tin(II)chloride (SnCL2..2H2O) in ethanol at temperatures between 70 Â°C and 80 Â°C (as described in Tetrahedron Lett. 1984,25, 839), or alternatively in polar aprotic solvents, like DMF, DMA or NMP and the like, optionally in the presence of bases, like for example pyridine or triethylamine and the like, at temperatures between 0 Â°C and 80 Â°C. Another suitable method is using zinc-powder in the presence of ammonium chloride in protic solvents like for example water or ethanol at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 80 Â°C. The exact conditions for the<br>
respective compounds of general formula II can be found in the experimental part.<br>
i	*)<br>
Compounds of general formula VII, in which R andR are as described above,<br>
can be prepared by different routes depending on the individual residues R1 and R2.<br><br>
As described in scheme D, compounds of the general formula Vila, in which R is as described above, R is chloro or fluoro and R' is hydrogen, can be prepared by protection of the amino group of compounds of the general formula Via, in which R is as described above, R is chloro or fluoro and R' is hydrogen, with a tert-butoxycarbonyl-group (BOC). One possibility for the protection of the amino function is for example reacting compounds of general formula Via with di-tert.-butyl-carbonate in the presence of a base such as cesium carbonate. The reaction can be carried out in polar solvents such as acetone or butanone and the like at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 80 Â°C.<br><br>
Alternatively, the protection of the amino group can be achieved by preparing the intermediate isocyanate by treatment of compounds of the general formula Via,, in which R is as described above, R is chloro or fluoro and R* is hydrogen, with diphosgene, preferably in aprotic solvents such as EtOAc or 1,4-dioxane at temperatures from 0 Â°C to 100 Â°C, and subsequent treatment of the isocyanate with tert.-butanol in solvents such as dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane and the like at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 85 Â°C to give the desired compounds of general formula Va.<br>
Another suitable method to achieve this protection step is the intermediate formation of a di-BOC compound by treatment of compounds of the general formula Via,, in which R1 is as described above, R is chloro or fluoro and R' is hydrogen, with di-tert-butyl-carbonate in the presence of DMAP in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and the like, followed by selective removal of a single BOC-group by treatment with a Bronsted-acid, like e.g. TFA, in aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane at temperatures between 0 Â°C and 20 Â°C to give the desired compounds of general formula Va.<br>
Yet another suitable method to produce compounds of general formula IXa is the intermediate formation of a N-Ac-BOC compound by treatment of compounds of the general formula Via, in which R1 is as described above, R is chloro or fluoro and R' is acetyl, with di-tert.-butyl-carbonate in the presence of DMAP in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and the like, followed by selective removal of a single BOC-group by treatment with a Bronsted-base, like e.g. aqueous ammonia (NH4OH), in aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether or 1,4-dioxane and the like, at temperatures between 0 Â°C and 20 Â°C to give the desired compounds of general formula Va.<br>
Apparently, the protection of the amino function as shown in scheme D can be applied to a number of commercially available starting materials or compounds synthesized by standard transformations [e.g. nitration followed by selective ammonolysis of the halide in ortho-position to the newly introduced nitro-group as described in /. Med. Chem. 1994,37,467; or ortho-nitration of acetanilide-compounds followed by deacetylation with for example aqueous potassium hydroxide solution or aqueous hydrochloric acid as described in Org. Synth. 1945,25,78 or in J. Med. Chem. 1985,25,1387] known to anyone skilled in the art to produce the corresponding 2-nitroanilines with the general formula Via, in which R1 is as described above, R is chloro or fluoro and R* is hydrogen, or 2-nitroacetanilides with the general formula IXa, in which R1 is as described above, R is chloro or fluoro and R' is acetyl The exact<br><br>
conditions for the respective compounds used in this invention can be found in the experimental part.<br>
According to scheme E, compounds of general formula VIb, in which R1 is pyrrol- 1-yl optionally substituted as described above, and R is hydrogen or chloro, can be prepared from commercially available 2-nitro-l,4-phenylenediamine [CAS-No. 5307-14-2] [for R = H] or known 5-chloro-2-nitro-l,4-phenylenediamine [CAS-No. 26196-45-2] [for R = CI] by selective condensation of the 4-amino-group with a suitable substituted 2,5-dimetfioxytetrahydrofuran with the general formula X, as described in/. Heterocycl Chem. 1988,25, 1003.<br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in acidic media, like for example acetic acid or propionic acid and the like, at temperatures between 40 Â°C to 120 Â°C. The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Also according to scheme E, compounds of the general formula Vic, in which R is pyrrol-1-yl and optionally substituted as described above and R2 is also as described above, can be prepared from N-(5-amino-2-nitro-phenyl)-acetamide-compounds of the general formula Kb, in which R2 is as described above, by performing the same condensation reaction of the 5-amino-group with a suitable substituted 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofiiran with the general formula X as described for the reaction with the 2-nitro-l,4-phenylenediamine. The deacetylation of the compounds of<br><br>
general formula IXc, in which R1 is pyrrol-1-yl and optionally substituted as described above and R is also as described above, to produce compounds of the general formula Vic, in which R1 is pyrrol-1-yl and optionally substituted as described above and R2 is also as described above, can be done by standard acidic or basic hydrolysis reaction known to someone skilled in the art and the exact conditions for the respective compounds used in this invention can be found in the experimental part.<br>
The synthesis of the corresponding N-(5-amino-2-nitro-phenyl)-acetamides with the general formula IXb, in which R2 is as described above, follows standard procedures known to someone skilled in the art and the exact conditions for the respective compounds used in this invention can be found in the experimental part.<br>
The corresponding substituted 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofiirans with the general formula X, in which Ra, Rb and Rc are as described above in the general claim for the pyrrol-1-yl compounds, are either commercially available, or synthesized from the suitable substituted fiiran, as shown in scheme F. The corresponding substituents can optionally be protected with suitable protecting groups, known to someone skilled in the art, or alternatively can be introduced after the pyrrol ring synthesis. The two-step sequence consists of reacting the furan with bromine in MeOH at low temperature, like for example -35 Â°C, followed by treatment with base, like for example triethyl-amine and the like or potassium carbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate and the like. The resulting 2,5-dimethoxydihydrofuran with the general formula VIII, in which Ra, Rb and Rc are as described above, can be reduced by catalytic hydrogenation, preferably in MeOH with catalysts like for example Palladium on carbon or Raney-Nickel and the like, to produce the desired 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofurans with the general formula X. An example for this sequence can be found in Tetrahedron 1971,27,1973-1996.<br><br><br><br>
Another method of preparing compounds with the general formula Vic, in which Rl is pyrrol-1-yl, optionally substituted as described above, is by nucleophilic substitution reaction of compounds of the general formula VI d, in which R is chloro or fluoro and R is as described above, with the corresponding pyrrol as shown in scheme F. The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. The base can be selected from the sterically hindered amines such as triethylamine or Hiinig's base, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and tert.-butoxide, or hydrides such as sodium hydride. The reaction can be performed at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 110 Â°C&gt; depending on the individual compounds to be synthesized. The exact conditions for the respective compounds used in this invention can be found in the experimental part.<br>
As shown in scheme H, compounds of general formula Vllb and VIIc, in which R2 is attached via a sulfur- or nitrogen-atom, respectively, and substituted with R' and R" as described above, can be prepared from compounds with the general formula Vila, in which Rl is as described as above and R is chloro or fluoro, by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with the respective amines or mercaptanes in the presence of a suitable base.<br><br><br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide and the like. The base can be selected from the sterically hindered amines such as triethylamine or Hiinig's base, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and tert-butoxide, or hydrides such as sodium hydride. The reaction can be performed at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 110 Â°C, depending on the individual compounds to be synthesized.<br>
As shown in scheme I, compounds of general formula Vlld, in which R is attached via an oxygen atom and R' is as described as above, can be prepared from compounds of the general formula Via, in which R1 is as described above and R is chloro or fluoro, by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with the respective alcohol (R'OH) in the presence of a suitable base to produce compounds of the general formula Vie, where the protection of the amino function can be performed as described earlier. The base can be selected from the class of Bronsted bases such as potassium hydroxide and the like. The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide, N-methyl-pyrrolidone or dimethyl sulfoxide and the like at temperatures between 20 Â°C and 100 Â°C.<br><br><br>
Yet another method of preparing compounds of the general formula Vlld is using O-allyl compounds with the general formula Vile, in which R1 is as described above, and perfoming a deallylation-alkylation sequence as outlined in scheme I. The deallylation is preferably carried out by transition-metal catalyzed isomerisation, e.g. in the presence of Rhodium(I)-salts like for example Wilkinson's catalyst or Palladium(II)-salts such as , followed by aqueous acid hydrolysis of the resulting vinyl ether. An example for this procedure can be found in /. Org. Chem. 1973, 38, 3224. Another method for the deallylation is the reaction with Palladium(O)-complexes such as  in the presence of excess of a secondary amine, as for example morpholine, as described for example in Synthesis 1996,755. The alkylation of the resulting phenols with the general formula Vllf, in which Rl is as described above, to the desired compounds of the general formula Vlld can be carried out with electrophilic reagents of the general formula R-X, in which R has the meaning of lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, alkyl acetate or benzyl and X represents a leaving group, for example iodide, bromide, methanesulfonate or tolylsulfonate, in a suitable solvent in the presence of a base. The reaction is preferably carried out in polar, aprotic solvents, for example chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or dichloroethane, or amides, for example dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and N-methyl-pyrrolidone, or sulfoxides, for example dimethyl sulfoxide. The base can be selected from the sterically hindered amines such as Hiinig's base, alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and tert.-butoxide, hydrides such as sodium hydride, hydroxides<br><br>
such as potassium hydroxide, carbonates such as potassium carbonate or hydrogen carbonates such as potassium hydrogen carbonate. The reaction can be performed at temperatures between -20 CC and 80 Â°C, depending on the individual compounds to be synthesized. For the synthesis of the 0-tert.-butyl compounds with the general formula Vlld, in which Rl is as described above and R2 is tert-butoxy, the phenols with the general formula Vllf can be treated with DMF-di-tert.-butylacetal in toluene or benzene at 80 Â°C as described in Synthesis 1983,135.<br><br>
According to synthetic scheme J, compounds of general formula Vllg, in which R is attached via a carbon atom and is as described above, can be prepared from compounds with the general formula Vila, in which R1 is as described as above and R is chloro or fluoro, by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with a malonic acid ester or -half-ester in the presence of a base as described for example in Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 1990,22, 636-638, followed by the removal of one of the alkyl carboxylates via decarboxylation as described for example in Synthesis 1993,51. The exact reaction conditions vary with the identity of the individual compounds and are described in the examples.<br><br><br>
According to Scheme K, the dioxinones and fi-keto esters building blocks with the general formula IV and IVa can be prepared by methods known to someone skilled in the art from the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives R3-COR, i.e. free acids, methyl or ethyl esters and acid chlorides. The exact conditions for the corresponding compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are rnetabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are acute and chronic pain, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are group II mGlu receptor antagonists. The compounds show activities, as measured in the assay described below, of 10 \iM or less, typically 1 |j,M or less, and ideally of 0.3 |iM or less. In the table below are described some specific Ki values of preferred compounds.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
f3Hl-LY354740 binding on mGlu2 transfected CHO cell membranes.<br>
Transfection and cell culture<br>
cDNA encoding the rat mGlu2 receptor protein in pBluescript II was obtained from Prof. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan), and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I-amp from Invitrogen (NV Leek, The Netherlands). This vector construct (pcDlmGR2) was co-transfected with a psvNeo plasmid encoding the gene for neomycin resistance, into CHO cells by a modified calcium phosphate method described by Chen &amp; Okayama (1988). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium with reduced L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration) and 10 % dialysed foetal calf serum from Gibco BRL (Basel, Switzerland). Selection was made in the presence of G-418 (1000 ug/mL final). Clones were identified by reverse transcription of 5 |j.g total RNA, followed by PCR using mGlu2 receptor specific primers S'-atcactgcttgggtttctggcactg-S' and 5,-agcatcactgtgggtggcataggagc-3&gt; in 60 mM Tris HC1 (pH 10), 15 mM (NH4)2S04,2 mM MgCl2,25 units/mL Taq Polymerase with 30 cycles annealing at 60 Â°C for 1 min., extention at 72 Â°C for 30 s, and 1 min. 95 Â°C denaturation.<br><br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells, cultured as above, were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and frozen at -80 Â°C. The pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and homogenised with a polytron (Kinematica, AG, Littau, Switzerland) for 10 s at 10 000 rpm. After centrifugation for 30 min. at 4 Â°C, the pellet was washed once with the same buffer, and once with cold 20 mM HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.4). Protein content was measured using the Pierce method (Socochim, Lausanne, Switzerland) using bovine serum albumin as standard.<br>
[3H]-LY354740 binding<br>
After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mM MgCb and 2 mM CaClo, (pH 7) (bindingbuffer). The final concentration of the membranes in the assays was 25 Î¼ g protein/mL. Inhibition experiments were performed with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-LY354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10Î¼ M DCGIV. After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 mL of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland).<br>
Data analysis.<br>
The inhibition curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving Ki<br>
values, and Hill coefficients.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
General procedure A<br>
Preparation of (2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert.-butyl esters from 2-nitroanilines or 2-nitroacetanilides<br>
Method a (from 2-nitroanilines): To a solution of diphosgene (4.1 mL, 34.1 mrnol) in EtOAc (40 mL) at 0 Â°C was added a solution of the 2-nitroaniline (45.5 mrnol) in EtOAc (200-500 mL), and the mixture was heated to reflux for 18 h. The solvent was removed in vacuum to leave a brown solid, which was triturated with hot hexane (200 mL). The solid material was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to leave the pure 2-nitrophenylisocyanate as a yellow solid. This material was refluxed in a mixture of excess tert-BuOH in CH2CI2 for 2.5 h. Removal of the solvent left an orange solid which was purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/EtOAc to give the (2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester as a yellow solid.<br>
Method b (from 2-nitroanilines): To a mixture of the 2-nitroaniline (142 mrnol) and cesium carbonate (55.5 g, 170 mrnol) in 2-butanone (740 mL) was dropwise added a solution of Boc20 (37.8 g, 173 mrnol) in 2-butanone (170 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred at 50 Â°C to 80 Â°C until tic indicated complete conversion. The solvent was removed in vacuum, the residue was treated with a mixture of H2O (240 mL) and MeOH (240 mL) and extracted with hexane (3 x 500 mL). The combined hexane layer was washed with brine (200 mL) and all aqueous layers were reextracted with hexane (300 mL). All combined hexane layers were dried over MgS04, filtered and the solvent was removed in vacuum to give an orange solid, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/EtOAc to give the (2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert.-butyl ester as a yellow solid.<br>
Method c (from 2-nitroanilines): To a solution of the-2-nitroaniline (550 mrnol) and DMAP (1.22 g, 10 mrnol) in THF (1000 mL) at 23 Â°C was dropwise added within 70 min a solution of Boc20 (246 g, 1128 mrnol) in THF (500 mL) and stirring was continued at 23 Â°C for 75 min. The entire mixture was evaporated to dryness and dried at HV to leave a dark brown solid. This material was dissolved in DCM (1100 mL), cooled to 0 Â°C and TFA (84 mL, 1100 mrnol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 0 Â°C for 2 h, poured into icecold sat. NaHCCVsol., extracted with DCM, washed with brine and dried over MgS04. Removal of the solvent in vacuum left a dark<br><br>
brown solid which was coated on silica gel and purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/EtOAc to give the (2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert.-butyl ester as a yellow solid.<br>
Method d (from 2-nitroacetanilides): To a solution of the 2-nitroacetanilide (100 mmol) and DMAP (122 mg, 1 mmol) in THF (100 mL) at 23 Â°C was dropwise added within 15 min a solution of Boc20 (22.92 g, 105 mmol) in THF (100 mL) and stirring was continued at 23 Â°C until tic indicated completed conversion. The entire mixture was evaporated to dryness and dried at HV to leave a yellow to dark brown solid. This material was dissolved in THF (200 mL) and 25 % NH4OH (77 mL, 500 mmol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 23 Â°C until tic indicated complete conversion, poured into IN HCl-soL, extracted with EtOAc, washed the organic layer with sat. NaHC03-sol. and brine, dried over MgS04. Removal of the solvent in vacuum left an yellow to brown solid which was generally pure enough for further transformation or - if necessary - coated on silica gel and purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/EtOAc to give the (2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester as a yellow solid.<br>
