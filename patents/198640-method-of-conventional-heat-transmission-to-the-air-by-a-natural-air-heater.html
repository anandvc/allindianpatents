According to this invention there is an inventive step provided improvement in or relating to the hot air blowers or air heaters of the type described herein comprising a structure, contains air-fuel cylinder, LPG gas cylinder and thermally covered copper made fluid stored container. The above fluid stored container is in the shape of stepped conical shape comprising a fluid filler neck with cap, purpose of fluid filling. A air breather hole, purpose of air breathing to the fluid stored container. The numbers of thinned flatted copper pipes are molded to the bottom of the above said fluid stored container, for drawing the fluid from the container. These copper pipes are extended from bottom of the container towards the conventional heat burner (each pipe independently) and the other (bottom) end of the above said copper pipes are molded to single copper pipe. At the top of the above said container, an exhaust pipe placed for the purpose of conventional heat gases discharge to the atmosphere. Provision is made by keeping the gap between the thermally insulated cover and the fluid stored containerfor<br><br>
passing of the conventional heat flames to the atmosphere after transmitting the heat to the fluid which is stored in the above said container. The above said single rounded copper pipe (which is connected by number of thinned flatted copper pipes) is connected with a fluid on\off cock, for the purpose of fluid flow restriction or put of the fluid flow when required. This cock further connected to the thermally insulated copper pipes for supplying the heated fluid, from the above said fluid container to the temperature transmission box, to supply the heated fluid from the fluid stored container to the temperature transmission box, when the electrical motor pump sucks the fluid from the above said fluid stored container. The above said conventional heat burner is fitted with the LPG gas burner igniting rod, for igniting the LPG gas burner with igniting switch, which is fitted on the on/off cock of LPG gas cylinder. The said igniting switch is to ignite the LPG gas burner. The said on/off cock is to control or put on/off of the LPG gas flow rate to the above said LPG gas burner. An electrical thermostat fitted in the container to operating the electrical relay valve at selected temperature of container stored fluid and also to eliminate the over heating of the container stored fluid. The above said relay valve controls the fuel flow either minimum or maximum level to the above said conventional heat burner.<br>
The above said heat transmission box is thermally insulated box, which is either square or rectangular or etc, but here it is in square shape, comprising atmosphere air windows with wire mesh at back side of the box, purpose of the windows are to filter the electrical fan sucked atmosphere air. The above said windows are fitted with shutters by mechanical linkage to the knob for operating the windows shutters at required position between close-open positions.

purpose of the fuel drain. The pressurised fuel is supplied by the metallic pipes to the conventional heat burner, which is fitted at the bottom of the fluid stored container.<br>
The operating and working process of Natural Air Heater is as follows;<br>
Check the fuel level in the container by checking the fuel gauge, if fuel is not up to maximum level, fill the fuel through fuel filling neck and tighten it fully. Fuel flow cock to be closed and pressurised the cylinder by connecting the foot pump or compressor to the compressed air charging neck, up to required pressure or up to the maximum of the cylinder with stand capacity. Now the LPG gas burner ignited by operating the igniting switch gas-cock, for heating up of the conventional heat burner. After conventional heat burner heated up, the fuel flow control cock to be opened slowly, so that the fuel goes to the conventional heat burner and it will ignite due to its heat and LPG gas burner flame. The conventional heat flames further passes surroundings of the thinned flatted copper pipes, and surroundings of the container, so that, the fluid heated up, which is inside the above said copper pipes and container. This conventional heat gases further goes to the atmosphere through the exhaust pipe. Now switch on the electrical motor pump, for sucking the heated fluid through the thermally insulated fluid transmission pipes and through the heat transmission box. When fluid passes through the above said small diameter thinned copper pipes, its outer surfaces are at the temperature of the fluid, which is at high temperature. Now switch on the electrical motor fan for sucking the air from atmosphere or from the room as per the selection of the windows operating control knob. The air, which is sucked by the electrical motor fan, will passes between the small diameter-thinned flatted copper pipes and heated up due to the fluid heat transmission through the said thinned-flatted copper pipes side walls. Now this heated air blown in to the rooms by the fan. For increasing or decreasing the room temperature, the electrical fan speed increased or decreased by the fan regulator for the required amount of hot air, to come in to the room. If the fluid temperature is increased at the thermostat selected position, it will operate the fuel flow electrical control cock for the supplying the minimum fuel to the conventional heat, until it is operated by the thermostat for supplying the fuel to the conventional heat burner.<br>
