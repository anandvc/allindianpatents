				<td>Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a stainless steel alloy, more precisely a duplex<br>
stainless steel alloy having ferritic-austenitic matrix and having high corrosion resis-<br>
tance in combination with good structural stability and hot workability, in particular a<br>
duplex stainless steel having-a ferrite content of 40-65 % by volume and a well-bal-<br>
anced composition that gives the material corrosion properties making it more suit-<br>
able for use in chloride-containing environments than what has previously been<br>
found possible.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In oil production in the sea, holes are drilled down from the bottom of the sea to the<br>
oil deposit. At the bottom of the sea, a unit is installed for control of the flow of the<br>
crude oil and further transportation to the units that are to handle and refine the<br>
crude oil to useful products or semi-finished products. At the unit on the bottom of<br>
the sea there is, among other things, valves that control extraction, pressure, flow<br>
rate, etc., and couplings to pipes with possibility of injecting chemicals into the oil<br>
well. Frequently, methanol is used for injection with the object of avoiding that crude<br>
oil coagulates and causes undesired stops in the production pipes.<br>
Valves and couplings on the unit at the bottom of the sea are controlled hydraulically<br>
and electrically from a platform, a production ship or another unit on the surface of<br>
the sea or on land. An umbilical cord pipe, a so-called umbilical, couples together the<br>
guiding unit with the units on the bottom of the sea. The part of the umbilical that lies<br>
on the bottom of the sea, for instance, between two underwater units on different<br>
extraction sites, is called static umbilical since the same only to a relatively small<br>
extent is effected by the motions of the sea. The part of the umbilical, that is situated<br>
between the bottom of the sea and the surface, is called dynamic umbilical and is<br>
effected to a large extent by motions in the water and on the surface. Examples of<br>
such motions are flows in the water, wave motions as well as motions of the platform<br>
and the production ship.<br>
The demands that are made on the pipes in an umbilical are foremost related to cor-<br>
rosion and mechanical properties. The pipe material has to be resistant to corrosion<br>
in sea water, which surrounds the outer surface of the pipes. This property is what is<br>
regarded as being most important, since sea water has a very corrosive impact on<br>
stainless steel. Furthermore, the material has to have high corrosion resistance to<br>
the possible corrosive solutions that are injected in the oil well. The material has to<br>
be compatible with hydraulic liquids without contaminating the liquid. Possible con-<br>
tamination may affect the service function of the control unit at the bottom of the sea<br>
very negatively.<br>
The mechanical properties of the used pipe material are very important for the appli-<br>
cation of umbilical pipes. Since the depth may be considerable on the site of the oil<br>
production, the dynamic part of the umbilical generally becomes long, and thereby<br>
heavy. The weight has to be carried by the platform or the floating production ship. In<br>
practice, there is two ways to decrease the weight of an umbilical having a given<br>
configuration. It is possible to choose a lighter material or a material having the same<br>
density but having higher tensile yield limit and ultimate tensile strength. By choosing<br>
a material naving higher strength, pipes having thinner wall may be used, and<br>
thereby the total mass of the umbilical is reduced. The deeper the sea at the site of<br>
extraction, the more important the total weight per unit of length of umbilical of the<br>
material will be.<br>
During the most recent years, when the environments in which corrosion-resistant<br>
metallic materials are used have become more heavy-duty, the requirements on the<br>
corrosion properties of the materials as well as on their mechanical properties have<br>
increased. Duplex steel alloys that were established as an alternative to hitherto<br>
used types of steel, such as, for instance, ferritic steel that previously were used in<br>
this application, nickel base alloys or other high-alloy steels, are not excepted from<br>
this development.<br>
Furthermore, the latest development on the market for umbilical pipes implies addi-<br>
tionally increased demands on the performance of the materials. The demands that<br>
hitherto have been made regarding strength and corrosion resistance have been<br>
able to be met by existing alloys. The new demands that are made on construction<br>
materials in the future for umbilicals mean, however, considerable exacting demands<br>
on corrosion resistance, by virtue of plants being projected in warmer waters as well<br>
as by virtue of process solutions in the umbilical will have higher temperatures. The<br>
new demands that are made may involve that the alloy must have resistance to<br>
crevice corrosion in sea water at temperatures up to 70-90 °C. Today's construction<br>
materials do not meet these requirements with sufficient reliability against corrosion.<br>
It is this problem that has to be solved. However, hitherto all feasible alloys that have<br>
been evaluated, have had a weak point. An alloy of higher resistance to chloride-<br>
induced corrosion that also meets other demands such as increased strength and<br><br>
good structural stability, would, on the other hand, mean greater possibilities to meet<br>
the new demands made on umbilical pipes.<br>
A recognized measure for the corrosion resistance in chloride-containing environ-<br>
ments is the so-called Pitting Resistance Equivalent (abbreviated PRE), being<br>
defined as<br>
PRE =%Cr+ 3,3 % Mo + 16 % N<br>
where the percentage figures of each element refer to percentage by weight.<br>
A higher numerical value indicates a better corrosion resistance, in particular to pit-<br>
ting. The principal alloying elements that affect this property are, according to the<br>
formula, Cr, Mo, N. An example of such a steel grade is seen in EP 0 220 141, which<br>
through this reference hereby is included in this description. This steel grade, having<br>
the trade mark of SAF 2507 (UNS S32750), has essentially been alloyed with high<br>
contents of Cr, Mo and N. Thus, it is developed towards this property with, above all,<br>
good corrosion resistance in chloride environments. Recently, also the elements Cu<br>
and W have turned out to be efficient alloying additives for additional optimization of<br>
the corrosion properties of the steel in chloride environments. The element W has,<br>
on that occasion, been used as substitution for a part of Mo, as for instance in the<br>
commercial alloys DP3W (UNS S39274) or ZeronlOO, which contain 2,0 % and<br>
0,7 % of W, respectively. The latter also contains 0,7 % of Cu with the purpose of<br>
increasing the alloy's corrosion resistance in acid environments.<br>
Addition of tungsten led to a further development of the measure for the corrosion<br>
resistance, and thereby the PRE formula to the PREW formula, which also eluci-<br>
dates the relation between the impact of Mo and W on the corrosion resistance of<br>
the alloy:<br>
PREW = % Cr + 3,3(% Mo + 0,5 % W) + 16 % N,<br>
as described, for instance, in EP 0 545 753, which relates to a duplex stainless alloy<br>
having generally improved corrosion properties.<br>
The above-described steel grades have a PRE number, irrespective of method of<br>
calculation, which is above 40 but the PRE number is limited upwards to about 43<br>
since higher values mean that the alloys obtain inferior structural stability. A higher<br>
degree of alloying increases the risk of precipitation of intermetallic phase, and<br>
therefore the level of alloying in duplex steel is regarded as limited to achieve PRE<br>
values around a maximum of about 43, irrespective of method of calculation.<br>
Of the alloys having good corrosion resistance in chloride environments, SAF 2906<br>
should also be mentioned, the composition of which is seen in EP 0 708 845. This<br>
alloy, which is characterized by higher contents of Cr and N in comparison with, for<br>
instance, SAF 2507, has turned out to be especially suitable for use in environments<br>
where the resistance to intercrystalline corrosion and corrosion in ammonium carba-<br>
mate is of importance, but it has also a high corrosion resistance in chloride-con-<br>
taining environments.<br>
The alloy has a corrosion resistance in chloride environment corresponding to the<br>
alloy UNS S32750, but simultaneously a higher yield point in tension Rpo.2. This<br>
makes that this alloy has advantages in comparison with UNS S32750 as umbilical<br>
material, since lower weight of the umbilical can be obtained. The corrosion resis-<br>
tance gives, however, no improvements in comparison with UNS S32750, which<br>
means considerable limitations in umbilical pipes that are exposed to higher tem-<br>
peratures in future plants.<br>
The alloy 19D (UNS S32001) is a duplex alloy characterized by the composition<br>
19,5-21,5% of Cr, 0,05-0,17 % of N and max 0,6 % of Mo. This alloy has a PRE<br>
number of about, 22, and therefore the alloy is unsuitable in sea-water applications<br>
such as umbilicals. Accordingly, in order to achieve a sufficient corrosion resistance<br>
in this alloy, a cathode protection has to be applied in the form of a zinc layer on the<br>
outer surface of the umbilical pipe. If the zinc layer is consumed or if a greater sur-<br>
face becomes damaged, the corrosion protection is, however, ruined and a fast cor-<br>
rosion process may occur, which means expensive repairs and down periods.<br>
A problem with the above-described alloys, all having high PRE numbers, is the<br>
appearance of hard and brittle intermetallic precipitations in the steel, such as, for<br>
instance, sigma phase, especially after heat treatment, such as, for instance, upon<br>
welding during later working. This results in a harder material having worse workabil-<br>
ity and finally a deteriorated corrosion resistance.<br>
Another group of alloys having good corrosion resistance is austenitic steels, with<br>
PRE numbers of up to 55 having been made possible by the addition of high con-<br>
tents of Cr, Mo and N combined with high contents of Ni. Said alloys should work<br>
very well to the new tougher corrosion conditions in umbilicals. The disadvantage of<br>
the same alloys is that they have considerably lower yield point in tension than<br>
duplex steel ai d are, furthermore, considerably more expensive to manufacture,<br>
foremost by virtue of their high percentage of Ni, which is an expensive alloying<br>
material. Examples of austenites having good resistance in chloride environment are<br><br>
UNS S32654 having a PRE number of about 55, and UNS S34565 having a PRE<br>
number of about 45. These have, however, too low a strength and high a cost in<br>
order to be a realistic alternative for umbilical pipes.<br>
In order to additionally improve, among other things, the pitting resistance of duplex<br>
stainless steel, an increase of the PRE number is required in both the ferrite phase<br>
and the austenite phase without, because of this, jeopardizing the structural stability<br>
or the workability of the material. If the composition in the two phases is not equiva-<br>
lent in respect of the active alloying components, one of the phases becomes more<br>
susceptible to pitting and crevice corrosion. Thus, the more corrosion-susceptible<br>
phase controls the resistance bf the alloy, while the structural stability is controlled by<br>
the highest alloyed phase.<br>
The demands that may be made on an alloy that shall meet the requirements in the<br>
future for umbilical pipes, can be summarized in table 1, with examples of the best<br>
various alternative alloys existing on the market in the present situation being<br>
included. It is clear that all existing alloys on at least one point do not meet the new<br>
stiffer demands that are made on umbilical pipes.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a duplex stainless steel alloy,<br>
which has high corrosion resistance in combination with improved mechanical properties<br>
and simultaneously having good structural stability and that is most suitable for use in<br>
environments where a high resistance is required to general corrosion and local corrosion,<br>
such as, for instance, in chloride-containing environments.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a duplex stainless steel alloy<br>
having a Critical Pitting Corrosion Temperature (henceforth abbreviated CPT) value<br>
greater than 90°C, preferably greater than 95°C and a Critical Crevice Corrosion<br>
Temperature (henceforth abbreviated CCT) value of at least 60°C in 6% FeCI3.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide an alloy having an impact<br>
resistance of at least 100 J at room temperature and a yield point in tension Rp0.2 of at<br>
least 720 N/mm2 and an elongation upon tensile testing of at least 25% at room<br>
temperature.<br>
The material according to the present invention has, in view of the high alloy content<br>
thereof, extraordinarily good workability, in particular hot-workability, and should thereby<br>
be very suitable to be used for, for instance, the manufacture of bars, pipes, such as<br>
welded and seamless pipes, weld material, construction parts such as, for instance,<br>
flanges and couplings.<br>
The objects are met according to the present invention by means of duplex stainless steel<br>
alloys, which contain (in % by weight)<br>
C more than 0 and up to max 0.03 %<br>
Si up to max 0.5 %<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A systematic development work has surprisingly shown that by a well balanced com-<br>
bination of the elements Cr,Mo,Ni,N,Mn and Co, an optimum distribution of the<br>
elements in the ferrite and in the austenite can be obtained, which enables a very<br>
corrosion resistant material having only a negligible quantity of sigma phase in the<br>
material. The material also gets good workability, which enables the extrusion to<br>
weldless pipes. In order to obtain the combination of high corrosion resistance in<br>
connection with good structural stability, a very narrow combination of the alloying<br>
elements in the material is required. Therefore, the alloy according to the invention<br>
contains (in % by weight):<br>
C more than 0 up to max 0,03 %<br>
Si up to max 0,5 %<br>
Mn 0-3,0 %<br>
Cr 24,0-30,0 %<br>
Ni 4,9-10,0%<br>
Mo 3,0-5,0 %<br>
N 0,28 -0,5 %<br>
B 0-0,0030 %<br>
S up to max 0.010 %<br>
Co 0-3,5 %<br>
W 0-3,0%<br>
CU 0-2,0 %<br>
Ru 0-0,3 %<br>
Al 0-0,03 %<br>
Ca 0-0,010%<br>
balance Fe together with normally occurring contaminations and additives, the ferrite<br>
content being 40-65 % by volume.<br>
The impact of the alloying elements is described in the following:<br>
Carbon (C) has limited solubility in both ferrite and austenite. The limited solubility<br>
means a risk of precipitation of chromium carbides and therefore the content should<br>
not exceed 0,03 % by weight, preferably not exceed 0,02 % by weight.<br>
Silicon (Si) is utilized as deoxidizer in the steel production and increases the flowabil-<br>
ity in production and upon welding. However, too high contents of Si lead to precipi-<br>
tation of undesired intermetallic phase, and therefore the content should be limited to<br>
max 0,5 % by weight, preferably max 0,3 % by weight.<br>
Manganese (Mn) is added in order to increase the solubility of N in the material.<br>
However, it has turned out that Mn only has a limited impact on the solubility of N in<br>
the alloy type in question. Instead, there are other elements having higher impact on<br>
the solubility. Furthermore, Mn may in combination with high sulphur contents give<br>
rise to the formation of manganese sulphides, which work as initiation spots for pit-<br>
ting. Therefore, the content of Mn should be limited to between 0-3,0 % by weight,<br>
preferably 0,5-1,2 % by weight.<br>
Chromium (Cr) is a very active element in order to improve the resistance to the<br>
majority of corrosion types. Furthermore, a high chromium content means that a very<br>
good solubility of N is obtained in the material. Thus, it is desirable to hold the con-<br>
tent of Cr as high as possible in order to improve the corrosion resistance. For very<br>
good values of the corrosion resistance, the chromium content should be at least<br>
24,0 % by weight, preferably 27,0-29,0 % by weight. However, high contents of Cr<br>
increases the risk of intermetallic precipitations, and therefore the chromium content<br>
has to be limited upwards to max 30,0 % by weight.<br>
Nickel (Ni) is used as austenite-stabilizing element and is added in suitable contents<br>
so that the desired ferrite content is attained. In order to achieve the desired relation<br>
between the austenitic and the ferritic phase of between 40-65 % by volume of fer-<br>
rite, an addition of between 4,9-10,0 % by weight of nickel is required, preferably<br>
4,9-9,0 % by weight, in particular 6,0-9,0 90 by weight.<br>
Molybdenum (Mo) is an active element that improves the corrosion resistance in chloride<br>
environments as well as preferably in reducing acids. Too high a content of Mo, in<br>
combination with the contents of Cr being high, means that the risk of inter-metallic<br>
precipitations increases. The content of Mo in the present invention should be in the<br>
interval 3.0 - 5.0% by weight, preferably 3.6 - 4.9% by weight, in particular 4.4 - 4.9% by<br>
weight.<br>
Nitrogen (N) is a very active element that increases the corrosion resistance, the structural<br>
stability as well as the strength of the material. Furthermore, a high content of N improves<br>
the reformation of austenite after welding, which gives good properties of welded joints. In<br>
order to achieve a good effect from N, at least 0.28% by weight of N should be added. At<br>
high contents of N, the risk of precipitation of chromium nitrides increases, especially when<br>
the chromium content simultaneously is high. Furthermore, a high content of N means that<br>
the risk of porosity increases by virtue of the solubility of N in the charge being exceeded.<br>
The content of N should, for these reasons, be limited to max 0.5% by weight preferably is<br>
greater than 0.35 and up to 0.45% by weight of N added.<br>
Too high a chromium as well as a nitrogen content result in the precipitation of Cr2N,<br>
which is to be avoided since it deteriorates the properties of the material, especially .upon<br>
heat treatment, for instance welding.<br>
Boron (B) is added in order to increase the hot workability of the material. At too high a<br>
boron content, the weldablity and the corrosion resistance may be deteriorated. Therefore,<br>
the boron content should be greater than 0 and up to 0.0030% by weight.<br>
Sulphur (S) affects the corrosion resistance negativity by forming easily soluble sulphides.<br>
Furthermore, the hot workability is deteriorated, and therefore the sulphur content is<br>
limited to max 0.010% by weight.<br>
Cobalt (Co) is added foremost in order to improve the structural stability as well as the<br>
corrosion resistance. Co is an austenite stabilizer. In order to have an effect, at least 0.5%<br>
by weight, preferably at least 1.0% by weight should be added. Since cobalt is a relatively<br>
expensive element, the cobalt addition is therefore limited to max 3.5% by weight.<br>
Tungsten increases the resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion. But addition of too high<br>
contents of tungsten in combination with the contents of Cr and contents of<br>
Mo being high, means that the risk of intermetaliic precipitations increases. The<br>
content of W in the present invention should be in the interval of 0-3,0 % by weight,<br>
preferably between 0-1,8 % by weight.<br>
Copper is added in order to improve the corrosion resistance in acid environments<br>
such as sulphuric acid. Cu also affects the structural stability. However, high contents<br>
of Cu means that the solid solubility is exceeded. Therefore, the content of Cu is lim-<br>
ited to max 2,0 % by weight, preferably between 0,1 and 1 ,'5 % by weight.<br>
Ruthenium (Ru) is added in order to increase the corrosion resistance. Ruthenium is<br>
a very expensive element, and therefore the content is limited to;max 0,3 % by<br>
weight, preferably greater than 0 and up to 0,1 % by weight.<br>
Aluminium (Al) as well as Calcium (Ca) are utilized as deoxidizers in the steel pro-<br>
duction. The content of Al should be limited to max 0,03 % by weight in order to limit<br>
nitride formation. Ca has a favourable effect on the hot ductility but the content of Ca<br>
should, however, be limited to 0,010 % by weight in order to avoid undesired quantity<br>
of cinder.<br>
The ferrite content is important in order to obtain good mechanical properties and<br>
corrosion properties as well as good weldability. From a corrosion and a weldability<br>
point of view, it is desirable having a ferrite content of between 40-65 % in order to<br>
obtain good properties. Furthermore, high ferrite contents means that the low-tem-<br>
perature impact resistance as well as the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement risk<br>
being deteriorated. Therefore, the ferrite content is 40-65 % by volume, preferably<br>
42-60 % by volume, in particular 45-55 % bv volume.<br>
Description of Preferred Embodiment Examples<br>
In the examples below, the composition of a number of experimental charges is<br>
given, which illustrate the impact of various alloying elements on the properties.<br>
Charge 605182 represents a reference composition and is accordingly not included<br>
in the field of this invention. Neither should other charges be regarded as limiting the<br>
invention but only states examples of charges that illustrate the invention according<br>
to the claims.<br>
Given PRE numbers or values always relate to values calculated according to the<br>
PREW formula, even if not explicitly stated.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Experimental charges according to this example were produced by laboratory casting<br>
of 170 kg of ingot that was hot-forged into round bar. The same was hot extruded<br>
into bar (round bar as well as flat bar), where test material was sampled from round<br>
bar. Furthermore, flat bar was annealed before cold rolling took place, and then<br>
additional test material was sampled. The process may, from a material technology<br>
point of view, be regarded as representative for the manufacture on a larger scale,<br>
for instance for the manufacture of seamless pipes by means of the extrusion<br>
method followed by cold rolling. Table 2 shows composition of experimental charges<br>
of the first batch.<br>
With the purpose of examining the structural stability, samples from each charge<br>
were annealed at 900-1150 °C with steps of 50 °C and were quenched in air and<br>
water, respectively. At the lowest temperatures, intermetallic phase was formed. The<br>
lowest temperature where the amount of intermetallic phase became negligibly<br>
small, was determined by means of studies in light-optical microscope. New samples<br>
from the respective charge were then annealed at said temperature during five min-<br>
utes, and then the samples were cooled down by the constant cooling rate of<br>
-140 °C/min to room temperature. The area fraction of sigma phase in the materials<br>
was then determined by means of digital image processing of images recorded by<br>
means of back-scattered electrons in scanning electron microscope. The results are<br>
seen in Table 3.<br>
Tmax sigma is calcul ted by means of Thermo-Calc (T-C version N the thermody-<br>
namic database of steel TCFE99) based on guiding values of all stated elements in<br>
the different variants. Tmax sigma is the resolution temperature of the sigma phase,<br>
with high resolution temperature indicating lower structural stability.<br>
The object of this investigation is to be able to rank materials in respect of the struc-<br>
tural stability, i.e. this is not the actual content of sigma phase in the test pieces that<br>
have been heat treated and quenched before, for instance, corrosion test. It is evi-<br>
dent that Tmax sigma that has been calculated by means of Thermo-calc does not<br>
directly corresponds with measured quantity of sigma phase, but in this investigation<br>
it is, however, clear that the experimental charges having the lowest calculated Tmax<br>
sigma contain the lowest quantity of sigma phase.<br>
The pitting properties of all charges have been tested for ranking in the so-called<br>
"Green Death" solution that consists of 1 % FeCI3,1 % CuCI2,11 % H2SO4,12 %<br>
HCI. The test procedure corresponds to the pitting testing according to ASTM G48C,<br>
but is carried out in the more aggressive "Green Death" solution. Furthermore, some<br>
charges have been tested according to ASTM G48C (2 experiments per charge).<br>
Also electrochemical testing in 3 % NaCI (6 experiments per charge) has been carried<br>
out. The results in the form of critical pitting temperature (CPT) from all experi-<br>
ments are seen in Table 4, such as the PREW number (Cr + 3,3(Mo + 0,5 W) + 16<br>
N) of the total alloy composition as well as of austenite and ferrite. The indexing<br>
alpha relates to ferrite and gamma relates to austenite.<br>
It is recognized that there is a linear relation between the lowest PRE value in the<br>
austenite or the ferrite and the CPT value in duplex steels, but the results in Table 4<br>
show that the PRE number not solely explains the CPT value.<br>
It is clear from these results that all test materials have better CPT in the modified<br>
ASTM G48C than SAF 2507 and SAF 2906. Test charge 605 183 alloyed with cobalt<br>
shows good structural stability at controlled cooling rate (-140 °C/min), in spite of it<br>
containing high contents of chromium as well as molybdenum, has better results<br>
than SAF 2507 as well as SAF 2906. In this investigation, it is seen that a high PRE<br>
not solely explains the CPT values, but the ratio of PRE austenite/PRE ferrite is of<br>
utmost importance for the properties of higher alloyed duplex steels, and a very nar-<br>
row and accurate levelling between the alloying elements is required in order to<br>
obtain this optimal ratio, which is between 0,9-1,15; preferably 0,9-1,05 and simul-<br>
taneously obtain PRE values above 46. The ratio of PRE austenite/PRE ferrite ver-<br>
sus CPT in the modified ASTM G48C test for the experimental charges are<br>
accounted for in Table 4.<br>
The strength at room temperature (RT), 100 °C and 200 °C and the impact resis-<br>
tance at room temperature (RT) have been determined for all charges and are<br>
shown as mean value of three experiments.<br>
Tensile test pieces (DR-5C50) were produced from extruded bars 0 20 mm, which<br>
were heat treated at temperatures according to Table 2 for 20 min followed by cool-<br>
ing down in either air of water (605 195, 605 197, 605 184). The results of the inves-<br>
tigation are presented in Tables 5 and 6. The results of the tensile strength investi-<br>
; gation show that the contents of chromium, nitrogen and tungsten strongly affect the<br>
tensile strength in the material. All charges except 605 153 meet the requirement on<br>
a 25 % elongation upon ten.sile testing at room temperature (RT).<br>
This investigation shows very clearly that water quenching naturally is required in<br>
order to obtain the best structure and accordingly good impact resistance values.<br>
The requirement is 100 J upon testing at room temperature and this do all charges<br>
manage except charge 605 184 and 605 187, where, however, the last-mentioned<br>
one is very near the requirement.<br>
Table 7 shows results from Tungsten Inert Gas remelting test (henceforth abbrevi-<br>
ated TIG), with the charges 605 193, 605 183, 605 184 as well as 605 253 having a<br>
stable structure in the heat affected zone (henceforth abbreviated HAZ). The Ti-<br>
containing charges have TiN in HAZ.<br>
In the example below, the composition is given of an additional number of experi-<br>
mental charges manufactured with the intention of finding the optimal composition.<br>
Said charges are modified, based on the properties of the charges having good<br>
structural stability as well as high corrosion resistance, from the results that were<br>
shown in Example 1. All charges in Table 8 are comprised of the composition<br>
according to the present invention, with charges 1-8 being included in a statistical<br>
experimental plan, while charges e to n are additional experimental alloys within the<br>
scope of this invention.<br>
A number of experimental charges were produced by casting a 270 kg casting, which<br>
was hot-forged into round bar. This was extruded to bar, from which test materials<br>
were sampled. Then the bar was annealed before cold rolling of flat bar took place<br>
and then additional test materials were sampled. Table 8 shows the composition of<br>
the same experimental charges.<br>
The distribution of alloying elements in the ferrite and austenite phase was examined<br>
by means of micro probe analysis, the result is seen in Table 9.<br>
The pitting properties of all charges have been tested in the "Green Death" solution<br>
(1 % FeCI3, 1 % CuCI2,11 to H2SO4,1,2 % HCI) for ranking. The test procedure is<br>
the same as pitting testing according to ASTM G48C, but the testing is carried out in<br>
a more aggressive solution than 6 % FeCI3, the so-called "Green Death" solution.<br>
Also general corrosion test in 2 % HCI (2 experiments per charge) has been carried<br>
out for ranking before dew point testing. The results from all experiments are seen in<br>
Table 10, Figure 2 and Figure 3. All tested charges perform better than SAF 2507 in<br>
the Green Death solution. All charges are within the identified interval of 0,9-1,15;<br>
preferably 0,9-1,05 as regards the ratio PRE austenite/PRE ferrite at the same time,<br>
as PRE in both austenite and ferrite is higher than 44 and for most of the charges<br>
also substantially higher than 44. Some of the charges even reach the limit total PRE<br>
50. It is very interesting to note that charge 605 251, alloyed with 1,5 % by weight of<br>
cobalt, performs almost equivalent to charge 605 250, alloyed with 0,6 % by weight<br>
of cobalt, in "Green Death" solution, in spite of the lower chromium content in charge<br>
605 251. It is particularly surprisingly and interesting when charge 605 251 has a<br>
PRE number of approx. 48, which is higher than any commercial super duplex alloy<br>
today at the same time as the Tmax sigma value below 1010 °C indicates a good<br>
structural stability based on the values in Table 2 in example 1.<br>
In Table 10, also the PREW number (% Cr + 3,3 %(Mo + 0,5 % W) + 16 % N) is<br>
given for the total alloy composition and PRE in austenite as well as ferrite (rounded)<br>
based on phase composition being measured by means of micro probe. The ferrite<br>
content is measured after heat treatment at 1100 °C followed by water quenching.<br>
In order to more closely examine the factural stability, the samples were annealed<br>
for 20 min at 1080 °C, 1100 °C and 1150 °C, and then they were quenched in water.<br>
The temperature where the amount of intermetallic phase became negligibly small<br>
was determined by means of investigations in light-optical microscope. A comparison<br>
of the structure of the charges after annealing at 1080 °C followed by water quench-<br>
ing indicates which of the charges that are more inclined to contain undesired sigma<br>
phase. The results are seen in Table 11. Structural control shows that the charges<br>
605 249, 605 251, 605 252, 605 253, 605 254, 605 255, 605 259,605 260, 605 266<br>
as well as 605 267 are free from undesired sigma phase. Furthermore, charge<br>
605 249, alloyed with 1,5 % by weight of cobalt, is free from sigma phase, while<br>
charge 605 250, alloyed with 0.6 % by weight of cobalt, contains a little sigma phase.<br>
Both charges are alloyed with high percentage of chromium,,almost 29,0 % by<br>
weight, as well as molybdenum content of almost 4,25 % by weight. When the com-<br>
positions of the charges 605 249, 605 250, 605 251 and 605 252 are compared<br>
considering the sigma phase content, it is very clear that the composition interval for<br>
the optimal material in respect of, in this case, structural stability, is very narrow.<br>
Furthermore, it is evident that charge 605 268 contains only occasional sigma phase<br>
in comparison with charge 605 263, which contains much sigma phase. What<br>
essentially separates these charges, is addition of copper to charge 605 268. In<br>
charge 605 266 as well as 605 267, the sigma phase is free in spite of high chro-<br>
mium content, the later charge is alloyed with copper. Furthermore, the charges<br>
605 262 and 605 263, having the addition of 1,0 % by weight of tungsten, have a<br>
structure with much sigma phase, while it is interesting to note that charge 605 269,<br>
also having 1,0 % by weight of tungsten but of a higher nitrogen content than<br>
605 262 and 605 263, has a considerably smaller quantity of sigma phase. Thus, a<br>
very well-adjusted balance between the various alloying elements is required at<br>
these high alloy contents for, e.g., chromium and molybdenum, in order to obtain<br>
good structural properties.<br>
Table 12 shows the results from the light optical investigation after annealing at<br>
1080 °C, 20 min, followed by water quenching. The amount of sigma phase is indi-<br>
cated by means of values from 1 to 5, with 1 representing that no sigma phase has<br>
been detected upon the investigation, while 5 representing that a very high percent-<br>
age of sigma phase has been detected upon the investigation.<br>
In Table 13, results are shown from impact resistance testing of some of the<br>
charges. The results are very good, which indicates a fine structure after annealing<br>
at 1100 °C followed by water quenching and the requirement of 100 J is met by a<br>
large margin by all tested charges.<br>
Figure 4 shows the results from hot ductility test of most of the charges. A good<br>
workability is naturally crucial in order to be able to manufacture the material into<br>
product shapes such as bars, pipes, such as welded and seamless pipes, thread,<br>
weld material instruction parts such as, for instance, flanges and couplings. The<br>
charges 605 249, 605 250, 605 251, 605 252, 605 255, 605 266 as well as 605 267,<br>
most having a nitrogen content of around 0,38 % by weight, have somewhat better<br>
hot ductility values.<br>
The strain controlled fatigue properties give information about how much, and how<br>
many times, a material may be elongated, before strain controlled fatigue cracks<br>
arise in the material. Since umbilical pipes are welded together into long lengths, are<br>
reeled on drums before the are twisted into the umbilical, it is not unusual that a<br>
number of operations occurs where certain plastic deformation arises before the<br>
umbilical starts function. The strain controlled fatigue data that has been established<br>
emphasize that the risk of rupture as a consequence of strain controlled fatigue in an<br>
umbilical pipe borders on zero.<br>
Summary<br>
The demands that are made on umbilical pipes in the future and that are met by an<br>
optimised alloy according to above, is that PRE of min 46 in the alloy combined with<br>
the fact that PRE in austenite.or ferrite exceeds 45 is required in order to obtain suf-<br>
ficiently good pitting and crevice corrosion properties. Thus, it is required that:<br>
CPT in 6 % FeCl3 &gt; 90 °C<br>
CCT in 6 % FeCl3 &gt; 60 °C<br>
The strength that is required for being able to substantially reduce the weight of an<br>
umbilical is:<br>
Yield point in tension Rpo,2 min 720 N/mm2<br>
In order to be able to manufacture umbilical pipes and in order to guarantee that pit-<br>
ting and crevice corrosion resistance as well as mechanical properties being pre-<br>
served, the following is required regarding the structural stability:<br>
• The alloy shall be weldable by means of conventional welding methods<br>
• Maximally 0,5 % sigma phase in the structure<br>
e Maximum resolution temperature of sigma phase is 1010 °C<br>
The material according to the present invention has, in view of the high alloy content<br>
thereof, extraordinarily good workability, in particular hot-workability, and should<br>
thereby be very suitable to be used for, for instance, the manufacture of bars, pipes,<br>
such as welded and weldless pipes, weld material, construction parts, such as, for<br>
instance, flanges and couplings.<br>
