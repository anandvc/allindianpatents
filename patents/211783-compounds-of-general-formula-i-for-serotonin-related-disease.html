PIPERAZINYLPYRAZINE COMPOUNDS AS A<br>
AGONIST OR ANTAGONIST<br>
OF SEROTONIN 5HT-2 RECEPTOR.<br>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, to processes for their preparation, as well as to the use of the compounds for the preparation of a medicament which particularly acts on the central nervous system.<br>
Background of the Invention Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic, and the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. For example, serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions which originate in the central nervous system. A number of pharmacological and genetic experiments involving receptors for serotonin strongly implicate the 5-HT2c receptor subtype in<br>
the regulation of food intake (Obes. Res. 1995, 3, Suppl. 4,449S-462S). The 5-HT2c receptor subtype is transcribed and expressed in hypothalamic structures associated with appetite regulation. It has been demonstrated that the 5-HT2c receptor agonist<br>
m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mGPP), which has some preference for the 5-HT2c receptor, reduces food intake in mice that express the normal 5-HT2c receptor while<br>
the compound lacks activity in mice expressing the mutated inactive form of the 5-HT2c receptor (Nature 1995,374, 542-546). In a recent clinical study, a slight but<br>
sustained reduction in body weight was obtained after 2 weeks of treatment with mCPP in obese subjects (Psychopharmacology 1997,133,309-312). Recently, a series of pyrrolo[3,2,l-ij]quinoline derivatives was identified to be 5-HT2C receptor<br>
agonists having selectivity over the 5-HT2A receptor (Isaac M., et al., Bioorg, Med.<br>
Chem. Lett 2000,10,919-921). The compounds are said to offer anovel approach to the treatment of obesity and epilepsy.<br>
Weight reduction has also been reported from clinical studies with other "serotonergic" agents (see e.g. IDrugs 1998.1,456-470). For example, the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and the 5-HT releasing agent/reuptake inhibitor dexfenfluramine have exhibited weight reduction in controlled studies. However,<br><br>
currently available drugs that increase serotonergic transmission appear to have only a moderate and, in some cases, transient effects on the body weight<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has also been suggested to be involved in CNS<br>
disorders such as depression and anxiety (Exp. Opin. Invest, Drugs 1998.7,1587-1599; IDrugs, 1999,2,109-120).<br>
The 5-HT2c receptor subtype has further been suggested to be involved in<br>
urinary disorders such as urinary incontinence (IDrugs, 1999,2,109-120).<br>
Compounds which have a selective effect on the 5-HT2c receptor may<br>
therefore have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of disorders like those mentioned above. Of course, selectivity also reduces the potential for adverse effects mediated by other serotonin receptors.<br>

First, the various terms used, separately and in combinations, in the above definition of the compounds having the general foraiula (I) will be explained.<br>
By "heteroatom" is meant nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and in heterocyclic rings (including heteroaromatic as well as saturated and partially saturated heterocyclic rings), also selenium.<br>
The term "aryl" is intended to include aromatic rings (monocyclic or bicyclic) having from 6 to 10 ring carbon atoms, such as phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl (can be linked to the remainder of the molecule via a carbon atom in any ring) and indanyl (can be linked to the remainder of the molecule via a carbon atom in any ring).<br>

The compounds of formula (I) may possess one or more chiral carbon atoms, and they may therefore be obtained in the form of optical isomers, e.g. as a pure enantiomer, or as a mixture of enantiomers (racemate) or as a mixture containing diastereomers. The separation of mixtures of optical isomers to obtain pure enantiomers is well known in the art and may, for example, be achieved by fractional crystallization of salts with optically active (chiral) acids or by chromatographic separation on chiral columns.<br>
The necessary starting materials for preparing the compounds of fonnula (I) are either known or may be prepared in analogy with the preparation of known compounds.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the compounds of formula (I), in the formof free bases or salts with physiologically acceptable acids, can be brought into suitable galenic forms, such as compositions for oral use, for injection, for nasal spray administration or the like, in accordance with accepted pharmaceutical procedures. Such pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention comprise an effective amount of the compounds of formula (I) in association with compatible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier materials, or diluents, as are well known in the art The earners may be any inert material, organic or inorganic, suitable for enteral, percutaneous, subcutaneous or parenteral administration, such as: water, gelatin, gum arabicum, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycolate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium stearate, talcum, colloidal silicon dioxide, and the like. Such compositions may also contain other pharmacologically active agents, and conventional additives, such as stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, flavouring agents, buffers, and the like.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can e.g. be made up in solid or liquid form for oral administration, such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, syrups, elixirs, dispersable granules, cachets, suppositories and the like, in the form of sterile<br><br>
solutions, suspensions or emulsions for parenteral administration, sprays, e.g. a nasal spray, transdermal preparations, e.g. patches, and the like.<br>
As mentioned above, the compounds of the invention may be used for the treatment of serotonin-related disorders in a human being or an animal, such as eating disorders, particularly obesity, memory disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, pain, substance abuse, sexual dysfunctions, epilepsy, and urinary disorders. The dose level and frequency of dosage of the specific compound will vary depending on a variety of factors including the potency of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the patient's age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drag combination, the severity of the condition to be treated, and the patient undergoing therapy. The daily dosage may, for example, range fi:om about 0,001 mg to about 100 mg per kilo of body weight, administered singly or multiply in doses, e.g. from about 0.01 mg to about 25 mg each. Normally, such a dosage is given orally but parenteral administration may also be chosen.<br>

To the appropriate alcohol or thiol (1.8 mmol) in dry DMF (5 mL) was added Na-t-BuO (1.20 ml, 2.5 M in DMF) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. To the mixture was added a solution of the appropriate piperazino-substituted chloro heterocycle (0.625 mL, 2.0 M in DMF) and the mixture were stirred at 100 °C  for 5 h. The reactions were quenched with water (0.2 mL) and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in<br>
water/CHCl3 (20:80; 5 mL) and applied onto a column of Hydromatrix (40 mL) to<br>

Efficacy assay<br>
The agonist efficacy at the 5-HT2c receptor of the compounds in the<br>
Examples was determined by the ability of each compound to mobilise intracellular calcium in transfected HEK293 cells, stably expressing the human 5-HT2c receptor<br>
protein, using the calcium-chelating fluorescent dye FLUO-3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.).<br>
Typically, the maximum responses of 5-HT2c agonists were in the range of<br>
20-100% relative to the maximum response of 5-HT (serotonin) at a concentration of lµM.<br><br><br><br>
