				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a solid state cooling/ heating micro-climate conditioning device, said device being adapted to be used for various applications in cooling/ heating, to yield micro-climate condition, as described hereinafter.<br>
In hot natural environments, humans normally excel for maintaining correct body temperature. In such situation, blood flow through the skin increases, and perspiration provides evaporative cooling. However, in certain situations where the ambient temperatures are very high, the body's natural cooling mechanisms may become ineffective. Consequently, the body's heat balance is destroyed, and pentup metabolic heat increases body temperature. In that event, if correct work-rest regimens are not followed, individuals can suffer impaired concentration, fatigue, and possibly heat stroke.<br>
In cold environments, the human body responds by reducing blood flow to the skin, the hands, and the feet. The body also shivers to increase metabolic heat production. In such situation, insulating garments help significantly, but, it is often difficult to prevent a gradual lowering of overall body temperature. In some jobs, cold conditions result in greatly reduced productivity. In industrial sectors workers often endure significant discomfort, and cold-induced injuries can occur.<br>
It is known that when the body's natural cooling mechanisms get ineffective, liquid circulating garments are used, through which cool liquid flows, so as to render natural cooling. in very hot environments, these garments<br>
1<br><br>
also intercept heat from external sources, creating a cool "microclimate" to isolate the body from the heat. For applications where warming is required, liquid circulating garments can be used with warm liquid. Both produce a thermally corrected microclimate at the surface of the skin, protecting the user from excessive temperatures.<br>
To solve the problems faced in the aforementioned situations/environments, systems/units are used as microclimate cooling/heating unit, particularly for: i) cooling garment for tank crew personnel during tank<br>
operation;<br>
ii) cooling/heating space suit for astronauts; iii) micro-climate heating unit for defence personnel working<br>
at cold places;<br>
iv) soldiers exposed to hot environment; such as in: armored vehicle in desert operation; B-vehicle driver; infantry combat vehicle (ICB); engine room in ships and submarines;<br>
v) defence persons posted at military engineering services (MES) and being assigned with jobs like forging and foundry, welding and the like; and<br>
vi) pilots of fighter air craft or helicopter requiring such system for cooling their heads; amongst similar other situations.<br>
Micro climate control is also needed for industrial workers exposed to severe temperature conditions as in case of:<br>
blast furnace of steel industries;<br>
glass industries, and in similar industries.<br>
2<br><br>
In the aforesaid environments, particularly for liquid circulating garments to be used by army personnel, or for space suit, the heat load, which is developed, comprises several constituents e.g.. metabolic heat energy, heat energy-absorbed into the garment/suit from the environment, and other electrical and mechanical heat energy. The major portion of the heat load, of course, is generated by the user's metabolism. Generally, a liquid cooling garment (LCG), which is designed to remove metabolic heat energy, is worn by the occupant. The LCG generally includes a plurality of tubes strategically placed about the body. The tubes carry a cooling medium, such as water. The cooling medium absorbs the metabolic heat energy and flows to a device which transfers the heat energy therefrom.<br>
Systems/units which are used for the above purpose, to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of the applicants herein, involve complicated and costly arrangements, and those are not foolproof to meet the requirements of the users.<br>
Prior U.S. Patent No. 5092109 provides an apparatus for removing heat energy of a cooling medium passing from a "LCG", said apparatus including a heat sink assembly for absorbing the heat energy, and a heat transfer means for transferring the heat energy of the cooling medium to the heat sink assembly. The heat sink assembly is comprised of a phase change material, such as 7r-hexadecane paraffin, which is capable of isothermally absorbing heat energy as it changes phase from a solid to a liquid.<br>
Prior U.S. Patent No. 5564276 provides an apparatus for heating and cooling temperature controlled element, said<br>
3<br><br>
apparatus being used as micro-climatic conditioning unit. Said apparatus, however, involves a large number of components with complicated arrangement thereof. U.S. Patent No. 4744220 also discloses thermo electric heating and/or cooling system using liquid for heat exchange, wherein purified or filtered water is contained in an unpressurized and heavily insulated reservoir, said reservoir being heated or cooled by using a thermo electric module which is thermally coupled to the reservoir. To the knowledge and information of the applicants herein, the said system does not yield the desired result.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a solid state cooling/heating micro-climate conditioning device for its application in the various fields, as mentioned hereinbefore, which is not only economic, but is also intended to overcome the inherent drawbacks/disadvantages of the hithertoknown systems/arrangements, used for the same purpose, and also to achieve some added advantages/results, which will be described hereinafter.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a solid<br>
state cooling/heating micro-climate conditioning device which<br>
comprises a thermoelectric cooler based on Peltier effect, heater assembly said assembly having an <br>
inlet and an outlet for ingress and outgress of a fluid through said assembly; and means for feeding said fluid, under desired pressure, into said assembly through said inlet, either for absorbing heat energy into the fluid from the assembly, or for transferring heat energy from the fluid to the assembly, as required, said thermoelectric cooler/heater assembly having one or more flow line(s), connected to said,inlet and outlet, for flow of the fluid<br>
4<br><br>
through said flow line(s), and said flow line(s) being disposed between one or more thermoelectric module(s) and one or more heat exchanger(s), wherein each said thermoelectric module is constituted of a plurality of thermocouples connected electrically either in series or in parallel, and thermally in parallel, and each said thermocouple is made of a pair of thermoelements made of dissimilar materials, such as herein described, which are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel to yield cooling/heating energy, based on Peltier effect, with change of direction of the electrical current flow through the thermoelectric cooler/heater assembly.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the device according to the present invention are as under:<br>
The fluid, fed through the thermoelectric cooler/ heater assembly, is pretreated liquid or prefiltered air, the liquid being preferably water. Said means for feeding the fluid into the thermoelectric cooler/heater assembly is a pump. Said outlet of the cooler/heater assembly is adapted to be connected to a garment, and there is provided quick coupling disconnector(s), constituted by male and female connectors, for connection or disconnection, according to requirement of the user of the garment.<br>
Exhaust fan(s) is(are) provided in the vicinity of the heat exchanger(s) for forced convection of heat from the hot side of the thermoelectric assembly, in the event of its use for cooling the fluid flowing therethrough.<br>
5<br><br>
- The liquid flow is adapted to be recirculated to the thermoelectric cooler/heater assembly, as a closed loop system, after absorption of heat into the fluid from the user's source, or after transfer of heat from the liquid into the user's source, as required. In case air is used as the fluid, it is adapted to be left free to the atmosphere from the thermo-electric assembly, as an open loop system, instead of being recirculated through the user's source. In case of plurality of flow lines in the thermoelectric cooler/heater assembly, said flow lines are arranged in tandem or in parallel, as required, for the flow of the fluid therethrough, under pressure, with the help of said feeding means e.g. pump.<br>
Said flow line(s), in the form of cold plate(s), has(have) spiral hole with obstructions in its flow path to provide maximum heat transfer area as well as turbulence of the flow of the fluid therethrough. The flow lines may also be straight or curved in any shape and the obstructions may also be omitted depending on specific requirements of the users. The heat exchanger(s), constituting heat sink(s), used for transferring heat in case of cooling of the fluid, is(are) provided with fins.<br>
Spacer(s) is(are) provided in between the cold side heat exchanger and thermoelectric module. The dissimilar materials constituting the thermo elements, are of different metals, or of metal -semi-conductor, or of different semi-conductors, or<br>
6<br><br>
of metal - insulator, such as herein described. Two dissimilar semi-conductor materials constitute the thermo elements.<br>
The dissimilar semi-conductors are 'N' and 'P' type. The thermo electric semi-conductor materials are selected from bismuth-telluride, lead-telluride silicon-germanium alloys and the like. The thermo electric cooler/heater assembly is electrically connected to a DC mains source, and the direction of the electric current flow is adapted to be changed at said source either manually or with the help of an electronic circuit (remote control). In use of liquid e.g., water, for the purpose of cooling/heating, temperature of the liquid flow through the device or through the garment, connected to the device, is adapted to be controlled by liquid flow regulating means provided in the feeding means e.g. pump, or by an electronic circuit {remote control).<br>
A plurality of said thermo electric modules are sandwiched between heat sinks, constituted by said heat exchangers, on one side, and spacers and cold plate, constituted by said flow line, on the other, side, and each said cold plate, in turn, is sandwiched between two sub-assemblies, each of which sub-assembly is made up of a set of said thermoelectric modules, heat sinks and spacers, for the purpose of cooling fluid e.g. water or air, and the water/air, so cooled, being adapted to be circulated through a garment, for transfer of heat, as required<br>
7<br><br>
by the user of the garment.<br>
A number of said sandwiched assemblies are stacked together within a framework, the inlet of the flow line whereof is adapted to be connected to a feeding means e.g. pump, for feeding liquid e.g. water, under pressure, into the stacked assembly, and the outlet whereof is adapted to be connected to the inlet of a garment, the outlet of the garment, in turn, being adapted to be connected to a reservoir wherefrom said pump is adapted to recirculate the liquid into the stacked assembly,<br>
A network of small, flexible heat transfer flow lines e.g. made of PVC tubing, are provided inside the garment in parallel circuits, welded to soft manifolds with inlet and outlet, the said inlet being adapted to be connected to the outlet of the device, and the said outlet of the garment being adapted to be connected to a flowline leading to the thermoelectric cooler/heater assembly.<br>
The present invention also provides a garment for producing microclimate condition on the body of its user as required, wherein a plurality of heat transfer flowlines are provided inside the garment, and the inlet and outlet of said flowlines are adapted to be connected/disconnected in leak proof manner with the outlet and inlet respectively of a solid state cooling / heating microclimate conditioning device, as described herein.<br>
As preferred embodiments of the said garment;<br>
The said device is installed within or outside the<br>
garment.<br>
8<br><br>
The garment is in the form of apparel/industrial<br>
clothing or headgear, helmet or space suit.<br>
The apparel/ industrial clothing or space suit is fire<br>
proof and/or cold proof.<br>
The device according to the present invention is based on the principle of "Peltier Effect". When current passes through two dissimilar materials, one end gets heated and other gets cooled. By reversing the direction of current, hot and cold junctions are also interchanged. This phenomenon is known as "Peltier Effect". For Peltier Effect any two dissimilar materials can be used. It can be metal-metal, metal-semiconductor, semiconductor-semiconductor, metal-insulator and so on. It has been found that the best Peltier Effect is observed when two dissimilar semiconductor materials are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. It is, in fact, only since the refinement of semiconductor materials in the early 1950's that Peltier device / thermoelectric cooler has been considered practical for many applications. The components of a Peltier device / thermoelectric cooler can be seen best from a cross-section of a typical unit, such as that shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, which will be described hereinafter.<br>
The device according to this invention is solid state and CFC (Chloro-Fluoro-Carbon) free. This is highly reliable, low power consuming, and easily maintainable. Performance of the device has been ensured by innovative<br>
9<br><br>
design and assembly of the components, made possible by-software developed from mathematical modelling. Thermal impedance matching of all the components of the device treated as discrete thermal models with discrete characteristics has been ensured. Liquid cooling garments (LCG) worn under the protective clothing (micro climate) are used to absorb the excess metabolic heat from the body using thermoelectrically chilled fluids, such as water. In the device of this invention cooling is transferred by conduction through tubes (e.g. of PVC) carrying cooling medium. The cooling medium absorbs the metabolic heat energy and flows to the thermoelectric cooling assembly which transfers the heat energy therefrom.<br>
The device of this invention is a thermal assembly of a heat pump (the thermoelectric module using Peltier effect -TEM for short) and heat exchangers on the cold and hot sides. The heat exchanger on the hot side, also called the heat sink, must dissipate the heat from the higher temperature side of the thermoelectric module. The heat exchanger on the cold side, also called the cold plate, must transfer heat from flowing water to the lower temperature (Cold) side of the thermoelectric module. In one particular embodiment, the heat sink is of a fin type design with forced air fan. The cold plate is a copper plate with a spiral hole for water passage.<br>
The performance of the thermoelectric module is governed by the following factors of its components : Seebeck constant of thermoelectric material [Volts/K]; Specific resistance (ohm-cm) of the thermoelectric<br>
material;<br>
10<br><br>
Thermal conductivity [watt/cm-k] of the thermoelectric<br>
material;<br>
Number of thermocouples;<br>
Geometric factor of thermoelements (Area/Length) [cm] ;<br>
Temperature of cold side [°C];<br>
Temperature of hot side [°C];<br>
Differential between temperatures of cold and hot sides;<br>
Heat rate transferred to cold side [Watts];<br>
Current passed [A3 amps;<br>
Electric potential difference developed in TEM.[V];<br>
The performance of the heat sink is governed by the<br>
following factors:<br>
Ambient temperature;<br>
Overall heat transfer coefficient;<br>
Heat rate to be dissipated;<br>
The performance of the cold plate is governed by the<br>
following factors :<br>
Heat capacity of flowing fluid;<br>
Fluid inlet temperature to the cold plate;<br>
Fluid outlet temperature of the cold plate; Overall heat transfer coefficient of cold plate. The performance of the garment is governed by the following factors :<br>
Outlet fluid temperature of garment;<br>
inlet fluid temperature to garment;<br>
Overall heat transfer coefficient of garment;<br>
Flow rate of the fluid through the garment;<br>
Subject's skin temperature.<br>
A mathematical model has been developed that reflects the influence of all the above factors on the behaviour of the<br>
11<br><br>
cooling/heating unit. The mathematical equations that describe the system are solved simultaneously to obtain various design parameters. An iterative calculation is required, as the material properties are temperature dependent. These are repeated for each thermoelectric module (TEM), and based thereon computer program (software) is developed for the purpose of providing all the useful temperatures, heat rates and power consumed. Said computer program and mathematical model has enabled the applicants herein to select optimum number of TEM for a given heat sink, cold plate and garment characteristics. The optimisation is carried out with respect to the criterion of "minimum power consumption" for a required cooling. This method for optimum selection of components is termed as 'thermal impedence matching' of the various components.<br>
As stated earlier, the solid state cooling / heating micro climate conditioning device of this invention may be an air-based system or a liquid based system. In a liquid-based system, a fluid, such as water (usually treated to prevent fungus and bacterial growth) is chilled in a cooler assembly and circulated through a garment worn underneath NBC clothing.<br>
NBC Clothing i.e. Nuclear - Biological - Chemical clothing is not always required. It has very specific applications; such as :<br>
i) at space craft, the space suit/garment is NBC<br>
garment/clothing; and ii) in MBT Arjun or T-72 Tank, during nuclear war, such<br>
garments are required.<br>
The chilled liquid supplies sensible cooling to the<br>
12<br><br>
body. Cooling is achieved by conduction. After removing heat from the skin, the liquid returns to the cooler<br>
assembly. Thus, the system operates on a closed loop.<br>
In an air based system, ambient air is first chemically filtered (in a filter assembly), then cooled and dehumidified<br>
(in a cooler assembly), and then circulated through an air vest worn underneath NBC clothing. Air supplies both sensible and evaporative cooling to the body. Cooling is achieved through convection and evaporation. After removing heat from the skin, the air is discarded. Since the air is not recirculated, the air based system is an open loop system.<br>
The solid state/thermoelectric device of the invention cannot be used for all cooling problems. But, it can be considered when system design criteria include factors, such as, high reliability, small size or capacity, low weight, safety for hazardous electrical environment, and precise temperature control. It has been found that the device provides sufficient cooling even at 55 degree C ambient. Performance of the device of this invention has been ensured by innovative design and assembly involving:<br>
* selection of Peltier modules with the help of software<br>
developed from mathematical modelling, as explained<br>
hereinbefore;<br>
* thermal impedance matching of all the components of the<br>
device, treated as discrete thermal models with discrete<br>
characteristics, as aforesaid;<br>
* sandwich style assembly;<br>
* superior assembly technique;<br>
* lower power consumption; and<br>
13<br><br>
* high performance with low power consumption.<br>
The device is equally suitable for both air and liquid cooling, as mentioned hereinbefore, and it can also be reversed to provide useful heating.<br>
Optional provision of hot and cold switch for heating or cooling micro climate condition is endured, whereby maximum -minimum temperature can be adjusted by adjustable temperature controller.<br>
Rate of cooling/heating can be controlled by adjusting the flow of fluid from pump by speed control potentiometer either manually or by electronic circuit (remote control).<br>
The device is light weight, portable, compact and is of optimum choice where the space is limited. In the device of this invention only one moving part, namely, pump is used. Other moving part is fan, but,, the fan requirement is on very specialized applications. Fan will not be used for all the cases. The device is environmentally friendly without any compressor and/or CFC. Operation of the device is possible in any orientation, and in a micro gravity environment. Minimum acoustical noise is experienced. Maintenance requirements are also minimal.<br>
The nature and scope, Of the device according to the present invention will be better understood from the following description, set out by way of illustration, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein :<br>
Fig.1 shows in cross-section a typical thermoelectric<br>
cooler, based on Peltier Effect; Fig.2 schematically shows the salient features of a<br>
thermoelectric module, used in an embodiment of the device according to the present invention;<br>

device according to this invention, in its use<br>
for a liquid circulating garment; Fig.4 is a block diagram of the overall arrangement for<br>
heating/cooling micro-climate conditioning unit,<br>
using an embodiment of the device according to<br>
this invention; Fig.5 diagrammatically shows an embodiment of the<br>
sandwiched assembly of a thermoelectric<br>
cooler/heater according to this invention; Fig.6 diagrammatically shows the same embodiment of the<br>
assembly as shown in Fig.5, in cutaway section<br>
without top two side heat exchangers; Fig.7 diagrammatically shows the same embodiment of the<br>
assembly as shown in Fig.5, in cutaway section<br>
without top side heat exchangers; Fig.8 shows in sectional elevation, the same embodiment<br>
of the assembly as shown in Fig.5; Fig.9 shows in plan the same embodiment of the assembly<br>
as shown in Fig.5; Fig.10 diagrammatically shows an embodiment of the<br>
assembly shown in Fig.5, in a stacked form,<br>
without side walls; and Fig.11 diagrammatically shows the same stacked<br>
embodiment as shown in Fig.10, with side walls. As shown in Fig.1 in a Peltier/thermoelectric cooler, semiconductor materials (1) 'P'-type and (2) 'N'-type with dissimilar characteristics are connected electrically in series from a DC source (3), and thermally in parallel between a heat source (4) i.e. body to be cooled, and a heat<br>
15<br><br>
sink (5), so that two junctions are created. The semiconductor materials are 'N' and 'P' type, so named, because either they ,have more electrons than necessary to complete a perfect molecular lattice structure ('N'-type) or not enough electrons to complete lattice structure ('P'-type). The extra electrons in the 'N' type material and the holes left in the 'P'-type materials are called "Carriers" and they are the agents that move the heat energy from the cold to the hot junction, as shown by arrow. Electrical insulation, being a good heat conductor (6), is provided in between the heat source (4) and the semiconductors (1 and 2).<br>
Heat absorbed at the cold junction is pumped to the hot junction at a rate proportional to carrier current passing through the circuit and the number of couples. Good thermoelectric semiconductor materials such as bismuth-telluride, lead-telluride, Si-Ge alloys greatly impede conventional heat conduction from hot to cold areas, yet provide an easy flow for the carriers. In addition, these materials have carriers with a capacity for carrying more heat.<br>
In the thermoelectric cooler/heater assembly of the device according to this invention, couples similar to the single couple, shown in Figure 1, are combined in a module where they are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. Modules come in a great variety of sizes, shapes, operating currents, operating voltages, number of couples and ranges of heat pumping levels.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, thermoelectric modules (7) are placed / sandwiched between a cold plate (8), spacer blocks<br>
16<br><br>
(9) and heat exchanger (heat sinks) (10). The cold plate has inlet (11) and outlet (12) for liquid e.g. water.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a liquid circulating garment (13), worn by a user, is connected by tubes e.g.of PVC (14) to a thermoelectric cooler assembly (15), through quick coupling disconnectors (16), made of usual male and female connectors. Quick coupling disconnectors are metallic / non-metallic, male-female connectors. These are used to connect (i) hood and shirt; (ii) shirt and pants and (iii) overall inlet/outlet of the suit with thermo-electric cooling/heating unit (as shown in Figure 3).<br>
As shown in Pig. 4, the thermoelectric cooler (TE cooler) assembly consists of a thermoelectric cooler core (15), one liquid positive displacement pump (17), two ambient air fans (18), one small fluid reservoir (19) and the liquid lines (20), with quick coupling disconnectors (16).<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 to 11, the thermoelectric cooler/heater microclimate conditioning device according to the present invention is a thermomechanical assembly of a heat pump, constituted of thermoelectric modules (7), heat sinks, i.e. heat exchangers (10), spacers (9) and cold plates (8) .<br>
The thermoelectric modules (7) are sandwiched between the heat sinks (10) on one side, and the spacers (9) and cold plate (8) on the other side. Each cold plate is, in turn, sandwiched between two sub assemblies. Each of these subassemblies is made up of a set of thermoelectric modules, heat sinks and spacers. A number of sandwich assembly can be stacked together to remove the required amount of heat from water flowing through the cold plate, as shown in Figs. 10<br>
and 11.<br>
17<br><br>
As shown in Fig.4, a suitable pump(17) is used to make fluid flow through the cold plates (8) in tandem or parallel, as required. The cold plate has a spiral hole with obstructions in the flow path, to provide maximum heat transfer area as well as turbulence in flow.<br>
Fans (18) are mounted (if required) at suitable locations to carry the heat away from the heat sinks efficiently. The heat sinks have the optimum design of fins, to provide maximum area for heat transfer.<br>
When the cooler assembly is turned on, fluid (e.g.water) is drawn from the reservoir (19) by the pump (17). The fluid is pumped through the liquid channels of the "TE-cooler" core (15) where it is cooled. The fluid is then pumped through the internal liquid lines leading to the outlet port (12). From the outlet port external liquid lines are connected to the emergency disconnector (16) which directs the fluid to the liquid circulating garments (13).<br>
The chilled liquid passing through garment provides body and head cooling to the crew members. The liquid exiting the garments is returned to the inlet port (11) of the cooler assembly (15) via the emergency disconnector. During the cooling process, heat is transferred to the hot side of the TE-cooler and this is rejected to the ambient air. Fans are used for forced convention of heat through the hot side of the TE-cooler.<br>
By reversing the direction of current of TE-Cooler, the garment can be used as a heating garment (heat circulating garment) instead of cooling.<br>
The capacity (geometric factor and number of thermocouples or thermoelements) and number of thermoelectric<br>
18<br><br>
modules are selected to match the heat transfer capabilities of the heat sinks; cold plate; and the temperature and heat removal rate required at the application end.<br>
The closed loop water circuit is as follows (as shown in Fig. 4) :<br>
Outlet of the thermoelectric cooler unit is connected<br>
with the inlet of liquid circulating garment.<br>
Outlet of the liquid circulating garment is connected to<br>
the inlet of reservoir.<br>
Outlet of the reservoir is connected to the inlet of the<br>
liquid pump.<br>
Outlet of the liquid pump is connected with the inlet of<br>
thermoelectric cooler unit.<br>
