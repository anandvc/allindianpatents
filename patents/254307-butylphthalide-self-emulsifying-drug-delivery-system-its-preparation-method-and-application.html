FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel drug delivery and release system of<br>
butylphthalide, and particularly relates to butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug delivery<br>
system, and its preparation process and use in pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SEDDS) is a solid or liquid dosage form<br>
comprising an oil phase, a surfactant and a cosurfactant, characterized primarily in<br>
that said dosage form can form oil-in-water emulsion spontaneously in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract or at ambient temperature (referring generally to body<br>
temperature, namely 37Â°C) with mild stirring. As the amount of the emulsifying agent<br>
increases, such a self-emulsifying system can form micro-emulsion in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract spontaneously, and thus is called Self-microemulsifying Drug<br>
Delivery System (SMEDDS). When SEDDS enters the gastrointestinal tract, it is firstly<br>
self-emulsified as emulsion droplets and rapidly dispersed throughout the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, and thus reducing the irritation caused by the direct contact of<br>
the drug with the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract. In the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, the structure of the emulsion microparticulates will be changed<br>
or destroyed. The thus-formed microparticulates of micrometer or nanometer level<br>
can penetrate into the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract, and the<br>
digested oil droplets enter the blood circulation, thereby significantly improving the<br>
bioavailability of the drug. The self-emulsifying drug delivery system is predominantly<br>
employed with respect to lipid-soluble and less water-soluble drugs. It can increase<br>
the stability and the bioavailability of the drugs.<br>
Butylphthalide is a primary component in celeries and seeds thereof. It can be<br>
obtained by direct extraction from natural celery seed oil, or by synthesis. Chinese<br>
Patent for Invention No. 98125618.X disclosed the use of L-n-butylphthalide in the<br>
manufacture of an anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet agglutination drug, clearly<br>
demonstrating that L-n-butylphthalide can regulate the function of the NOS-NO-cGMP<br><br>
system and the metabolism of arachidonic acid in neuronal cells after cerebral<br>
ischemia. Chinese Patent for Invention No. 93117148.2 disclosed the use of<br>
butylphthalide in the manufacture of a medicament for preventing and treating a<br>
disorder caused by cerebral ischemia in a mammal or a human, wherein said<br>
butylphthalide is a liquid oil with no optical activity. It has an intense flavor of celery,<br>
and has the following formula:<br><br>
Currently, butylphthalide is commercially available only in the form of soft capsule,<br>
that is, butylphthalide is dispersed in vegetable oil and then directly filled into soft<br>
capsules. Though such a dosage form can mask the unpleasant odor of the agent, yet<br>
its content is poorly dispersed in an aqueous phase, and the extent of its dissolution in<br>
vitro cannot be directly determined, which not only obstructs the quality control during<br>
the production of the product, but also affects the absorption rate of the drug to a great<br>
extent.<br>
In addition, in Chinese Patent for Invention No. 02123000.5, the present inventors<br>
disclosed a technique to improve the water solubility of butylphthalide through the<br>
inclusion of cyclodextrin derivative. This technique not only masked the unpleasant<br>
odor but also increased the water solubility of butylphthalide. However, the amount of<br>
the primary component being used during the preparation of the inclusion substances<br>
is limited by the volume of the dosage form, and thus various dosage forms cannot be<br>
supplied to meet the requirements of patients. For example, the preparation of hard<br>
capsule dosage is limited by the loading capability, the preparation of tablets is limited<br>
by the suitability of tablet size, and the amount of the primary component in the<br>
inclusion subtances cannot be too large. Furthermore, the inclusion process<br>
consumes more power, has more processing steps, is more complex to be operated,<br><br>
and requires more process control points( such as the temperature, grinding mode<br>
and strength, time, stirring rate and duration). So the industrialization of said product<br>
inclusion technique is relatively slow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An objec of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantage of the above<br>
butylphthalide preparations in clinical use, and to provide a novel drug delivery system<br>
for butylphthalide, i.e. a self-emulsifying drug delivery system of butylphthalide.<br>
The self-emulsifying drug delivery system of butylphthalide provided in the present<br>
invention comprises as essential components 1% to 65wt% of butylphthalide, 10% to<br>
65wt% of an emulsifying agent, and preferably comprises as essential components<br>
10wt% to 50wt% of butylphthalide, 15wt% to 60wt% of an emulsifying agent, together<br>
with various excipients appropriately depending on the desired dosage forms to<br>
produce corresponding dosage forms, wherein the appropriate amount of the<br>
excipients used is 0 to 85%, preferably 5 to 75% (each of the above amounts is based<br>
on the total weight of the self-emulsifying drug delivery system for butylphthalide).<br>
Butylphthalide is selected from the group consisting of its racemic, levo-rotary and<br>
dextro-rotary isoforms.<br>
The self-emulsifying drug delivery system of the present invention is also useful for<br>
the delivery of oil-soluble derivatives of butylphthalide.<br>
In the present invention, preferably SEDDS emulsifying agents are non-ionic<br>
emulsifying agents. Non-ionic emulsifying agents are less toxic than ionic emulsifying<br>
agents, and merely induce reversible changes to the permeability of the mucous<br>
membrane of the gastrointestinal tract. SEDDS emulsifying agents of the present<br>
invention are selected from any of the group consisting of liquid or solid ethoxy<br>
polyoxyethylene glyceride, polyoxyethylene oleoate, liquid lecithin (e.g. Ophase 31,<br>
HLB=4.0), polyoxyethylene castor oil (Cremophor EL, HLB=13.5), coconut oil,<br>
polyethyleneglycol glyceride (Labrafac CM10, HLB=10), almond oil oleic acid<br>
polyethyleneglycol glyceride (Labrafil M1944CSD, HLB=3 to 4; Labrafil M2125CS,<br><br>
HLB=3 to 4), polyoxyethylene (25) glycerin trioleoate (Tagat TO, HLB=11.3),<br>
polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan oleoate (Tween 80, HLB=11.0), polyethyleneglycol-8<br>
glycerin caprylate/caprate (Labrasol, HLB=14) and the like, or the mixture of any two<br>
or more thereof.<br>
Preparation Procedure: The emulsifying agents are completely melted in water bath<br>
at 20 to 60Â°C and mixed, then butylphthalide is added with agitation, and excipients<br>
are added, to produce a dosage form of the butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug<br>
delivery system.<br>
The present invention also provides a series of formulations of butylphthalide<br>
self-emulsifying drug delivery, and various butylphthalide dosage forms with a<br>
mechanism of self-emulsifying drug delivery, together with excipients appropriate for<br>
corresponding dosage forms, such as tablets, soft capsules, granules, hard capsules<br>
and oral liquids for self-emulsifying drug delivery of butylphthalide.<br>
The self-emulsifying drug delivery system for butylphthalide of the present invention<br>
is especially useful for a dosage form of soft capsule, whose content is a liquid oil of a<br>
self-emulsifying feature, which comprises butylphthalide, an emulsifying agent, and<br>
optionally an excipient. The excipients are selected from any one of the group<br>
consisting of edible plant oils, for example sesame oil, corn oil, peanut oil, soybean oil,<br>
almond oil, peach kernel oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower seed oil, and Oliver oil, or the<br>
mixture of any two or more thereof. Optionally, the dosage form may additionally<br>
comprise an anti-oxidant and a lipophilic flavoring.<br>
The excipients contained in the self-emulsifying soft capsules of the present<br>
invention can be conventional excipients in the art. The butylphthalide self-emulsifying<br>
drug delivery system of the present invention can also be useful for a dosage form of<br>
oral liquid, which is a liquid oil of a self-emulsifying feature and can be administered<br>
after being diluted with water. Into the above-mentioned butylphthalide<br>
self-emulsifying drug delivery system, water, solubilizing agents, and appropriate<br>
flavorings can also be added to directly obtain an oral liquid.<br>
The butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug delivery system of the present invention may<br><br>
also be useful in the form of oral solid powders or granules. The oral solid formulations<br>
of the butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug delivery system of the present invention,<br>
such as tablets (including delayed capsules, and controlled release tablets), capsules<br>
(including delayed, and controlled release capsules), granules and the like, can be<br>
obtained by incorporating excipients as required by the oral solid formulations, such<br>
as disintegrants, binders, flavorings, and/or polymeric scaffold materials, etc, to the<br>
aforementioned butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug delivery system, resulting in solid<br>
powders or granules of a self-emulsifying feature by conventional techniques.<br>
Tablets of the butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug delivery system according to the<br>
present invention can be produced by mixing solid powders or granules being capable<br>
of self-emulsification with appropriate plasticizing agents, disintegrants and lubricants,<br>
and subsequently pressing with appropriate mould size. If necessary, the tablets can<br>
be coated with an appropriate coating such as a gastric coating, enteric coating, or<br>
delayed or controlled drug release coating including cellulose acetate, ethyl cellulose<br>
and the like.<br>
Hard capsules of the butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug delivery system according<br>
to the present invention can be produced by combining solid powders or<br>
granulesbeing capable of self-emulsification with conventional lubricants, delayed<br>
release materials and the like, resulting in normal hard capsules, or controlled or<br>
delayed release capsules.<br>
The content in the self-emulsifying soft capsules of the present invention is an oil<br>
liquid capable of self-emulsification. When the capsules are disintegrated in water, the<br>
drug is rapidly dispersed into water to form an oil-in water emulsion. As a result,<br>
product quality can be assessed by the dissolution test. Additionally, the contact area<br>
of butylphthalide with the gastrointestinal tract is greatly increased, thereby increasing<br>
the absorption rate of the drug. The self-emulsifying drug delivery system of the<br>
present invention can be prepared by a single and easily operated process. Moreover,<br>
it has the advantages of lower power consumption during its production or preparation<br>
process and a high degree of industrialization, etc.<br><br>
Butylphthalide self-emulsification soft capsules have the properties of its strong special<br>
odor being masked by the normal soft capsules, administration convenience, easy<br>
swallowing, and good compliance of patients. Moreover, they allow the oily active<br>
ingredients to be rapidly dispersed when getting contact with the gastric fluid to form an<br>
oil-in-water emulsion, thereby increasing the extent and the rate of absorption. The<br>
present formulation is shown in the acceleration test and the long-term test that,<br>
although the aging of the shell of the present soft capsule is significant when being<br>
heated and the disintegration time is elongated, it is still less than 60 minutes, and thus<br>
complies with the provisions of Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Various parameters such as<br>
appearance, content, degradation products, the time for self-emulsification and the in<br>
vitro release degree of the present formulation are not significantly changed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the result of the particle size distribution of butylphthalide self-<br>
emulsification system being measured with a laser particle size distribution analyzer.<br>
FromFigure 1, it can be seen that more than 98% of the emulsion droplets have a<br>
particle size of less than 5 Âµm, and thus said system belong to a self-microemulsifying<br>
drug delivery system. It can also be concluded from the volume less-than-percentage<br>
profile in Figure 1 that particle size distribution in the present system is narrow and<br>
uniform.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A soft capsule is used in the present invention as a preferred dosage form of the<br>
butylphthalide self-emulsifying drug delivery system.<br>
The content in the soft capsule of the self-emulsifying drug delivery of the present<br>
invention comprises butylphthalide and an emulsifying agent, preferably in the following<br>
percentages by weights: 10% to 50% of butylphthalide, and 15% to 60% of said<br>
emulsifying agent. Into the oily liquid of the drug can also be added an appropriate<br>
antioxidant such as dibutyl hydroxytoluene and a flavoring agent such as<br><br>
mint oil, green apple oil, and the like.<br>
The emulsifying agent is preferably the mixture of polyoxyethylene castor oil and<br>
polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate/caprate preferably in the ratio of 1:0.5 to<br>
1.5(by weight). The ratio of butylphthalide to the emulsifying agent is preferably 1:0.5<br>
to 1.5 (by weight).<br>
Preferred Preparation Process: Hydrogenated castor oil is adequately melted in a<br>
water bath at 25 to 50Â°C, then polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate/caprate is<br>
added and mixed with agitation to obtain a homogenous clear oily liquid.<br>
Butylphthalide is added and mixed with agitation at room temperature. The contents<br>
for the soft capsules are thus obtained.<br>
The shell of the soft capsule of the self-emulsifying drug delivery system according to<br>
the present invention consists essentially of shell composition, plasticizing agent, and<br>
water in the ratio by weight of 1:0.2 to 0.4:0.8 to 1.3. Furthermore, into the shell can<br>
also be incorporated appropriate preservative such as ethylparaben, methylparaben<br>
or the mixture thereof.<br>
The shell composition can be gelatin, acacia gum, or the mixture thereof.<br>
The plasticizing agent can be glycerin, sorbitol, or the mixture thereof.<br>
The present butylphthalide soft capsule can be produced by conventional processes<br>
for the preparation of soft capsules, such as the manual compression moulding<br>
method, the rotary compression moulding method or the dropping method. Generally,<br>
the compression methods such as the rotary compression moulding method is<br>
employed, using an automatic rotary capsule-rolling machine, with the temperature<br>
being controlled in the range of 40 to 50Â°C, so that each soft capsule contains a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable amount of butylphthalide.<br>
The following examples are shown to describe the embodiments of the present<br>
invention in detail. They are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of butylphthalide self-emulsification soft capsules<br>
Preparation of Gelatin Solution: 100 g of gelatin, 30 g of glycerin, 130 g of water and<br><br>
200 mg of ethylparaben are used. An appropriate amount of water is added into<br>
gelatin, allowing it to absorb water and to swell. Glycerin, ethylparaben and residual<br>
water are placed into a tank and heated to a temperature of 70 to 80Â°C, and<br>
homogeneously mixed. Swollen gelatin is added with agitation, melted, incubated for<br>
1 to 2 hrs, and kept rest for foams to float up. The floating foams are then scraped, and<br>
the remainder is filtered through a clean white cloth and kept warm for further use. The<br>
viscosity of the resulting gum liquid is generally 2.8 to 3.2 degree.<br>
Preparation of oily liquid of butylphthalide: 100 g of butylphthalide, 50 g each of<br>
polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate/caprate and polyoxyethylene castor oil are<br>
weighed and thoroughly agitated to obtain the oily liquid.<br>
Compression of soft capsules: the prepared gelatin glycerin and oily liquid of<br>
butylphthalide are placed into an automatic rotary capsule-rolling machine, and the<br>
temperature is kept at 40 to 50Â°C. Soft capsules each containing 200 mg of the oily<br>
liquid are encapsuled.<br>
The soft capsules have an appropriate size in appearance and good content<br>
consistency as measured.<br>
Example 2: Validation of the process for preparing butylphthalide self-emulsification<br>
soft capsules<br>
Preparation of the Gelatin Solution: 1000 g of gelatin, 300 g of glycerin, 1300 g of<br>
water and 2000 mg of ethylparaben are used. An appropriate amount of water is<br>
added into the gelatin, allowing it to absorb water and swell. Glycerin, ethylparaben<br>
and residual water are placed into a tank and heated to a temperature of 70 to 80Â°C,<br>
and homogeneously mixed. The swollen gelatin is added with agitation, melted,<br>
incubated for 1 to 2 hrs, and kept rest for foams to float up. The floating foams are then<br>
scraped, the remainder is filtered through a clean white cloth and kept warm for further<br>
use. The viscosity of the resulting gum liquid is generally 2.8 to 3.2 degree.<br>
Preparation of oily liquid of butylphthalide: 1000 g of butylphthalide, 500 g each of<br>
polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate/caprate and polyoxyethylene castor oil are<br><br>
weighed and thoroughly mixed to get the oily liquid.<br>
Compression of soft capsules: The thus prepared gelatin glycerin and the oily<br>
liquid of butylphthalide are placed into an automatic rotary capsule-rolling machine,<br>
and the temperature is kept at 40 to 50Â°C. Soft capsules each containing 200 mg of<br>
the oily liquid are encapsuled.<br>
The resulting soft capsules prepared at the above ratios have an appropriate size<br>
in appearance and good content consistency as measured.<br>
Three batches of samples are prepared according to the procedure in Example 2.<br>
The consistencies of the dissolution and particle size are investigated for the three<br>
batches of the samples. The degree of dissolution and the particle size is determined<br>
as follows:<br>
Dissolution Test: The present soft capsules are tested according to the<br>
Dissolution Test (Appendix X C: Method 2, in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2005 edition,<br>
Part II), where 900 ml of water is used as the solvent, and the rotatory rate is set at 100<br>
rpm. The test is performed as described. After 45 minutes, 10 ml of the solution is<br>
removed and filtered. 5 ml of the filtrate is precisely removed and transferred into a 10<br>
ml measuring flask. Methanol is added into the flask to the scale for dilution and<br>
homogeneously shaken. The absorbance at the wavelength of 280 nm is<br>
spectrophotometrically determined (Appendix IV A, in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2000<br>
edition, Part II). 25.0mg of the control sample of butylphthalide is precisely weighed<br>
and placed into a 50 ml measuring flask, methanol is added for dissolution and dilution<br>
to the scale, then mixed homogeneously. 5 ml of the solution is precisely taken and<br>
placed into a 50ml measuring flask, then 20 ml of methanol is added. Water is<br>
supplemented into the flask to the scale for dilution, and homogeneously shaken. The<br>
resultant solution is used as the control and measured by the same procedure. The<br>
dissolution of each capsule is calculated and the results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Analysis of the Particle Size Distribution:<br>
Model Nano-ZS of MALVERN Particle Size Analyzer is used. Protocol: the<br>
content of the present capsules is taken and diluted by 100 times with artificial gastric<br><br>
fluid and used as the test solution. 1 ml of aliquot is placed into a sample cell. The<br>
measurement is performed at a setting temperature of 25Â°C. The range of the particle<br>
size distribution and summed distribution is analyzed using unimodality statistics. The<br>
results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1.<br>
Microscopic analysis: 0.2 ml of the oily liquid is aliquoted and dropwise added into<br>
100 ml of the artificial gastric fluid at 37Â°C with mild agitation, and immediately a<br>
homogeneous oil-in-water emulsion is formed spontaneously. 10 Âµl of the thus-formed<br>
emulsion is placed on a glass slide for microscopic investigation.<br>
Statistically 98.7% of the emulsion droplets have a particle size of smaller than 5 Âµm,<br>
which is substantially consistent with the results as measured by MALVERN particle<br>
size distribution analysis, and lies within the range of microemulsification. So it is<br>
designated as butylphthalide self-emulsifying (self-microemulsifying) drug delivery<br>
system based on the characteristics of the present dosage form.<br><br><br><br><br>
caprylate/caprate and polyoxyethylene castor oil are weighed, the subsequent steps<br>
are the same as in Example 1, except that in the preparation of the oily liquid, a<br>
solubilizing agent such as 20 g of propylene glycol is additionally incorporated and<br>
thoroughly mixed. Each of the final soft capsules contains 220 mg of the oily liquid of<br>
butylphthalide.<br>
Example 4: Preparation of soft capsules of butylphthalide<br>
Preparation of Gelatin Solution: 100 g of gelatin, 40 g of glycerin, 120 g of water<br>
and 200 mg of ethylparaben are used. The gelatin solution is prepared by the same<br>
protocol as in Example 1.<br>
Preparation of the oily liquid of butylphthalide: 500 g of butylphthalide, 600 g of<br>
polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate and 500 mg of orange flavoring agent are<br>
weighed and thoroughlymixed to obtain the oily liquid.<br>
Compression of soft capsules: The procedure is the same as in Example 1,<br>
except that each of the final compressed soft capsules contains 220 mg of the oily<br>
liquid of butylphthalide.<br>
Example 5: Preparation of soft capsules of butylphthalide<br>
Preparation of oily liquid of butylphthalide: 100 g of butylphthalide, 65 g of<br>
polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate/caprate, and 50 g of polyoxyethylene castor oil<br>
are weighed and homogeneously mixed, resulting in a clear oily liquid.<br>
Preparation of Gelatin Solution: 100 g of gelatin, 30 g of glycerin, 120 g of water<br>
and 20 g of PEG400 are used. The protocol for preparing the gelatin solution is the<br>
same as in Example 1.<br>
The steps are the same as in Example 1, except that each of the final soft<br>
capsules contains 210 mg of the oily liquid of butylphthalide.<br>
Example 6: Preparation of soft capsules of butylphthalide<br>
100 g of butylphthalide, 40 g of polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate/caprate,<br><br>
and 50 g of polyoxyethylene castor oil are weighed and thoroughly mixed to obtain a<br>
clear oily liquid.<br>
Preparation of Gelatin Solution: 100 g of gelatin, 40 g of glycerin, 120 g of water<br>
and 10 g of PEG400 are used. The procedure for preparing the gelatin solution is the<br>

absorbed to 40 g of Poloxamer, 60 g of maltodextrin, 60g of microcrystalline cellulose<br>
and 8 g of sodium carboxymethyl starch. The resultant mixture is granulated through<br>
mesh #32, dried at 45 to 50Â°C, and sized through mesh #20. After the addition of talc<br>
as a lubricant and mixing, the granules are distributed into capsule shells #2.<br>
Example 15: Preparation of delayed release capsules of self-emulsifying<br>
butylphthalide<br>
100 g of butylphthalide, 50 g of polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate, 50 g of<br>
hydrogenated castor oil, 100 mg of mint oil, and 100 mg of green apple oil are mixed<br>
together as a binder, then slowly added to the mixture of 100 g of hydroxypropyl<br>
methyl cellulose (HPMCK100M), 80 g of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMCK4M), and<br>
10 g of ethylcellulose. The resultant mixture is agitated homogeneously, granulated<br>
through mesh #32, dried at 45Â°C, and then sized through mesh #20. After adding 5 g<br>
of magnesium stearate as a lubricant and mixing, the granules are distributed into<br>
capsule shells #1.<br><br>
Example 16: Preparation of oral liquid (oil) of self-emulsifying butylphthalide<br>
100 g of butylphthalide, 50 g of polyethyleneglycol-8 glycerin caprylate, 50 g of<br>
hydrogenated castor oil, 0.1 g of orange flavoring, and 0.1 g of mint oil are mixed, then<br>
added to 5 L of an aqueous solution containing 1% aspartame and 0.01% sodium<br>
ethylparaben to form an oil-in-water emulsion. The resultant solution is distributedto 5<br>
ml, 10 ml, 20 ml, or 50 ml bottles for oral administration depending on the needs of<br>
patients.<br>
Example 17: Preparation of oral oily liquid of self-emulsifying butylphthalide<br>
The formulation is prepared substantially in the same way as in Example 12,<br>
except that an antiseptic agent such as ethylparaben and aspartame (before being<br>
added, aspartame can be firstly dispersed by a small amount of alcohol) is added<br>
when preparing the oily liquid. Colorless clear oily liquid is obtained by mixing, then<br>
directly distributed into graduated bottles for oral administration. Upon use, a<br>
measured use of the oral liquid is taken and added into water to form an oil-in-water<br>
emulsion for administration. Alternatively it is possible for the emulsionto be directly<br>
administered, which spontaneously form an oil-in-water emulsion when getting<br>
contact with the body fluid.<br>
Example 18: A pharmacokinetic experiment in rats after oral administration of soft<br>
capsules of self-emulsification butylphthalide<br>
The soft capsules of self-emulsifying butylphthalide prepared in Example 1 are<br>
used in the pharmacokinetic experiment after oral administration in rats. The results<br>
are compared to those obtained from commercially available soft capsules (the<br>
content is the mixture of 100 mg of butylphthalide and 300 mg of vegetable oil.<br>
Manufactured by NBP company of SHIJIAZHUANG PHARM. GROUP). They are<br>
shown in Table 3.<br><br><br>
From Table 3, it can be seen that the present self-emulsifying drug delivery system<br>
achieves the peak concentration of the drug more rapidly than normal oily content.<br>
Their tmax is 0.1 and 1.0 h, respectively. Additionally, the peak concentration achieved<br>
by the present soft capsules is higher than that achieved by normal soft capsules.<br>
Less individual variations are observed with the present soft capsules.<br>
It is believed from the description above that after entering gastrointestinal tract,<br>
SEDDS is firstly self-emulsified into emulsion droplets, and subsequently rapidly<br>
dispersed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, thereby reducing the absorption<br>
difference in individuals due to the poor dispersion of the oil droplets, and reducing the<br>
irritation caused by the direct contact of the drug with the mucous membrane of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, the organization of the emulsion microdroplets may<br>
be changed or destroyed in the gastrointestinal tract. Above all, promising clinical<br>
values are demonstrated by the application of self-emulsifying drug delivery system to<br>
the lipid soluble and less water soluble oily drug - butylphthalide.<br><br>
