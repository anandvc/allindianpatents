DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
US20060133407A1 describes a method to provide access control for a shared content in a communication system. According to the method, a user sharing the content can create an access list wherein only the visitors present in the list are allowed access to a part or all of the shared content based on the user configuration. The application also mentions that in one of the embodiments, the communication system where the method is applied is a SIP controlled network. Further there is a provision to send a status notification in case there is any change made by the user to the shared content. The application however does not explicitly mention time based subscription by a particular user or the provision of unsubscribing for the content once shared.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to communication systems. In particular, the invention describes a method to provide a service to users in IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) / VOIP network wherein the user can allow visitors to their portal page to subscribe to multimedia content. According to the invention, a visitor to a portal page can subscribe to multimedia content that is shared by another user through a portal service. The categories to which a visitor can subscribe to, is controlled by the user. The user can define categories for the multimedia content and grant access to one or more categories to a visitor, visiting the portal page. Once a visitor subscribes to a particular category of the multimedia content, he gets notification whenever there is a further update on the content of that category. Also there is a provision for the user to allow notifications to be sent based on the life time of the content availability. There is further a provision for the visitor to unsubscribe to the subscription or can also subscribe for a fixed time.<br>
The subscription can be either using a SIP subscribe message or HTTP messages. In case of SIP based subscription, the user sends SUBSCRIBE message to the presence server and gets 200 OK confirmations whereas in web based subscription, HTTP request is sent with subscription details, which the application server v&amp;lidates and saves with the XDMS.<br><br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method to provide services in IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) / VOIP network wherein a portal owner allows visitors to a web portal and allows the visitors to subscribe to multimedia content where the multimedia contents are categories and the content to which a visitor can subscribe to, is controlled by the portal owner.<br>
The portal owner defines categories for the multimedia content and grants access to one or more categories to a visitor, visiting the web portal. Once a visitor subscribes to a particular category of the multimedia content, the visitor gets notification whenever there is a further update on the content of that category. The portal owner allow notifications to be sent to the visitors based on a life time indicating the content availability. The method further comprising the step of allowing the visitors to unsubscribe to the subscription or configuring subscription for a fixed time for a multimedia content. The web portal display the content based on an access control lists where the access control lists specify access of various types of content to be shared with each visitor of the web portal. Different types of categories are personalized and granted the access permissions by the web owner and stored in XDMS. The subscription is either using a SIP subscribe message or HTTP messages. The portal owner publish the multimedia content change event notification package, with a Presence server / Application server through SIP and HTTP protocols. The presence server sends notification through NOTIFY message, for all the visitors who has subscribed. In case if a visitors device doesn't support SIP based Subscribe / Notify package, then such visitors optionally request the Application server to<br><br>
Subscribe for the Multimedia Content change event Notification package and in such cases, Application server receives a NOTIFY message from the presence server and based on the visitors choice the Application server notifies accordingly. Application server is adapted to send SMS / Email / MMS / HTTP request / IM based message with a changed content information based on visitors choice. The visitors are adapted to access, unsubscribe or cancel the content through SIP and HTTP<br>

This invention in general is related to IMS and VOIP based Application Server providing a service to any users in IP Multimedia Sub-system (IMS) A/OIP network. User(s) who has the Portal service can avail this feature by allowing the visitors of their portal page to Subscribe to personalized Multimedia content. Portal pages allow users to visit, and select their choice of content type(s) subscriptions.<br>
As a part of the service users can subscribe to the personalized multimedia content updates/new content, which is shared by another person through Portal service. Users once logged or accessing others portal page, they have to configure with network their choice of content updates in specific/general. Once subscribed, user(s) will get notifications whenever there is a new multimedia content, based on the category updated. Similarly user(s) can configure for the notifications related to life time of the content availability, and in specific - prior notifications before the content gets lapsed. Users can also unsubscribe to earlier subscriptions, or subscription expires based on the time specified.<br>
Presence Server shall support the event subscription package for Multimedia Content in order to provide various types of notifications. User(s) can subscribe for content update/change/expiry/prior expiry notifications with the Presence Server through SUBSCRIBE / NOTIFY messages. User(s) visit the other user's<br><br>
personal portal pages. Portal pages display the content for subscription / download / stream based on the access control lists. Access control lists specify access of various types of content to be shared with each user visiting the portal page. User(s) will see the content shared in portal pages and if they are interested can subscribe for future updates of the content. Content subscription can be based on the category of the content<br>
(Example:      Category (Education or Knowledge sharing)  recorded  lecture given in class room,<br>
Category (Interests): video captured during visit to historic place, Category (Sports): video recorded during football match, etc.)<br>
Different types of categories can be personalized and created by the person who has portal service and based on his ( portal owner) choice can grant the access permissions which can be stored in XDMS. For example all the contacts from the family group can view/subscribe all types of content categories, general visitors can share general category of contents etc,<br>
Once a user visits the portal / personal web page / enterprise web page he will be allowed to see / download / subscribe to specific content types. And this service / feature allow the user to subscribe for future update/change/expiry/prior expiry notifications. Subscription can be using a SIP Subscribe message to subscribe for multimedia content change event notification package or it can be based on HTTP messages and configuring through a portal or web pages. Subscription is valid for a specific time period based on user configured value. In<br><br>
case of SIP based subscription, user sends SUBSCRIBE message to presence server and receives 200 OK confirmations. For Portal / web based subscription user sends HTTP request with all the subscription details. Application server validates the data and saves with XDMS. Optionally Application server can subscribe with presence server.<br>
User(s) can upload /delete / modify contents with the content library for different categories/types of contents. Content can be audio / video or any media combination / MS Office category of document or any other related type of content.<br>
User updates the new content information through Portal or through web pages to the Content library. After logging in to content system, user can upload the content which belongs to different content categories.<br>
Once up loaded user has to publish with the presence server about the content change event. Change event can be new file uploaded / change in existing content / content deleted / new category or type is added to the library / expiry time for the existing content / any other type of information related with the content.<br>
The user, who is having the portal service and subscribed to multimedia content change event notification package, can PUBLISH the changed content data with Presence server / Application server through SIP and HTTP protocols. User logs<br><br>
on to Portal / content system and updates the multimedia content to content library. Once content is updated then Application server checks for the user configuration data, in case if user opted for Application server to publish the content change information. Then Application server sends PUBLISH message to Presence server. User can send SIP PUBLISH message to presence server in order to publish the changed event information, and receives the confirmation from server.<br>
The presence server will send notification through NOTIFY message, for all the subscribers. In this case all the user(s) and optionally Application server will receive the NOTIFY message for the Multimedia content change event. Through notification all the interested user(s) will come to know about the event.<br>
In case if the User(s) client device doesn't support SIP based Subscribe / Notify package, then such clients can optionally request the Application server to Subscribe for the Multimedia Content change event Notification package. In such cases, Application server receives a NOTIFY message from the presence server. Based on the user(s) choice Application server can notify in different ways.<br>
Application server can inter work with other servers and can send SMS / Email / MMS / HTTP request / IM based message with the changed content information based on the user(s) choice. User(s) will configure their choice with application server while subscribing through Application server.<br><br>
User(s) can access, the content through SIP and HTTP. In case client supports IM and MSRP protocols, then user(s) client device can send INVITE / 200 OK / ACK to establish a session, and using MSRP session get the media stream from content / MRFP server. User(s) client device can also access the content using the HTTP protocol and media streaming /download protocols. Content can be accessed for operations like streaming / download etc.,<br>
User(s) can unsubscribe or cancel the subscription anytime using SIP /HTTP.<br>
Figure 1 shows the architecture for IMS based application server. Figure 2 shows User checking the categories of content allowed for Subscription through PortalAA/eb Page. The User logs into others Portal/ Web page through HTTP. This is done by sending a HTTP Request. The Application server receives the request from the web server. The Application server then fetches the Portal / access control lists from XDMS, related to the requested user's id. Portal page provides various categories of content which is available for subscription by the user. Access authorization rules will be applied to the user visiting the portal page and accordingly the allowed categories of content for subscription are provided to the user. User checks the allowed categories of content for subscription through web page.<br>
Figure 3 shows the sequence of events that happen when the User subscribes to the content category / type, from the allowed content types/ category sent in<br><br>
response or available in Portal / Web page in response. The User checks the allowed categories of content for subscription through web page response available part of the Portal. User selects his choice for Subscription based on category and type of multimedia content allowed The choice is sent in the HTTP Request, which is the request for the HTTP based multimedia content subscription. Application server validates the contents received in the request, creates a XCAP Request and sends it to XDMS for saving in persistent DB.XDMS validates the XCAP request and saves in the persistent DB.XDMS replies with 200 OK for successful confirmation to the XCAP request to the Application server The Application server inturn replies with 200 OK for successful confirmation to the HTTP request. Application server then subscribes for the multimedia content change event package. Application server sends SUBSCRIBE message and receives 200 OK from Presence server.<br>
In Figure 4 the User agent subscribes to the Multimedia Content Sharing event package in order to receive notifications from the other user. The User agent sends the SIP SUBSCRIBE message to the Presence Server and receives 200 OK once subscription is confirmed.<br>
In Figure 5 the User logs into Portal/ Web page through HTTP. The multimedia content is uploaded to the content server via Web server and the category for the content and required details are configured. The Content server sends the HTTP request to Application Server with the content, category and other details. Application server creates a PUBLISH message with the category/type of<br><br>
content updated according to the schema and sends to Presence Server. Presence server updates the users profile with the latest details of content. Presence server Creates a NOTIFY message for all the subscribers who has subscribed for Multimedia content change event notification package and NOTIFY message is sent to all the subscribers. Presence server Receives the 200 OK for the notify message. Optionally the Client can also update the Presence server about the content updation details by sending the PUBLISH message. Presence server confirms with the 200 OK message back to the client. Publishing the new content or change content details to the Presence server can be done by Client or Application server based on User choice set during configuration. User agent2 sends INVITE / 200 OK/ ACK messages to the Application server to establish a session to retrieve the shared multimedia content. Application server initiates an H.248 / SIP based session with the MRFP / Content system. An MSRP session is established with Content System/ MRFP and chunks of multimedia content are received through SEND / 200 OK. Once the multimedia content is retrieved the session is closed with BYE /200 OK messages.<br>
According to Figure 6 the User logs into Portal/ Web page through HTTP. The multimedia content to the content server is uploaded via Web server and the category for the content and required details are configured through the portal/webpage. Content server sends the HTTP request to Application Sen/er with the content category and other details. Application server creates a PUBLISH message with the category/type of content updated according to the<br><br>
schema and sends to Presence Server. Presence server updates the users profile with the latest details of content and Creates a NOTIFY message for all the subscribers who has subscribed for Multimedia content change event notification package. The NOTIFY message is sent to all the subscribers and the 200 OK for the notify message will be received by the presence server. Optionally the Client can also update the Presence server about the content updation details by sending the PUBLISH message. Presence server confirms with the 200 OK message back to the client. Publishing the new content or change content details to the Presence server can be done by Client or Application server based on User choice set during configuration. User agent2 based on the changed event link received in NOTIFY message, sends HTTP request message to request for a multimedia stream from content server. The multimedia content from the content server is streamed to the client.<br>
Figure 7 shows the sequence of events for User uploading the Multi Media Content and Notifying through SMS/MMS/Email to Subscribed users. The User logs into Portal/Web page through HTTP. The multimedia content to the content server is uploaded via the Web server and the category for the content and required details are configured. The Content server sends the HTTP request to Application Server with the content, category and other details. Application server creates a PUBLISH message with the category/type of content updated according to the schema and sends to Presence Server. Presence server updates the users profile with the latest details of content. After updating, presence server Creates a NOTIFY message for all the subscribers who has<br><br>
subscribed for Multimedia content change event notification package and NOTIFY message is sent to all who has subscribed. Presence server Receives the 200 OK for the notify message.<br>
Publishing the new content or change content details to the Presence server can be done by Client or Application server based on User choice set during configuration. Application server retrieves the subscription information from the XDMS by sending the XCAP Request. XDMS sends back the list in response 200 OK. Application server will get the list of users, to send the changed content notification through the means of configured method. Content change notification can be sent using SMS / MMS/Email/HTTP Request / IM. Application server sends the SMS / Email / MMS / HTTP request / IM based message with the changed content information based on the user choice, to respective server for delivery to user agent. User agent sends response message based on the request type received. User agent 2 based on the changed event link received in SMS/Email/MMS/HTTP Request /IM, sends HTTP request message to request for a multimedia stream from content server. The multimedia content from the content server is streamed to the client.<br>
Figure 8 shows the User agent unsubscribes from the Multimedia Content Sharing event package in order to receive notifications from the other user. User agent sends the SIP SUBSCRIBE message to the Presence Server and receives 200 OK once unsubscription is confirmed.<br><br>
