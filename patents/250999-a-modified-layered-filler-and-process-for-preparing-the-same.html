				<td>This application claims the benefit of Serial No. 60/632,828, filed December 3,2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to modified layered fillers made from layered fillers and modifying agents and processes to produce the same. The invention also relates to nanocomposite compositions made from these modified layered fillers and elastomers, and processes to produce the same, and their use in articles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Nanocomposite materials have been the subject of much academic and industrial literature due to a large extent on their ability to impart new properties for a given material. In particular, polymeric nanocomposites, such as elastomer-clay nanocomposites, have been of considerable interest. As used here, nanocomposites or polymeric nanocomposites are typically polymer systems containing inorganic particles with at least one dimension in the nanometer range of the polymer matrix.<br>
[0003] The preparation of nanocomposites uses a number of methods to generate exfoliated clays. One of the most common methods relies upon the use of organically modified montmorillonite clays. Organoclays are typically produced through solution based ion-exchange reactions that replace sodium ions that exist on the surface of sodium montmorillonite with organic molecules such as alkyl or aryl ammonium compounds and typically known in the industry as swelling or exfoliating agents.    See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,807,629, WO <br>
02/100935, and WO 02/100936. Other background references include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,576,373, 5,665,183, 5,807,629, 5,936,023, 6,121,361, WO 94/22680, WO 01/85831, and WO 04/058874.<br>
[0004] However, the alkyl chain length/type of many ammonium compounds limits the separation as shown, for example, in d-spacing between layers and the compatibility between the alkyl chains and polymer backbone. Therefore, new exfoliating agents are needed for improvements to modified layer fillers to produce nanocomposite compositions with improved properties such as better barrier properties for innerliner applications.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

[0006] In another embodiment, the invention provides for a nanocomposite composition comprising: an elastomeric composition, and a modified layered filler comprising: at least one layered filler and at least one modifying agent comprising at least one polymer chain E comprising a carbon chain length of from to C500 and an ammonium-functionalized group.<br>
[0007] In yet another embodiment, the invention provides for an article comprising a nanocomposite composition comprising: an elastomeric composition; a modified layered filler comprising: at least one layered filler and at least one modifying agent comprising at least one polymer chain E comprising a carbon chain length of from C25 to C500 and an ammonium-functionalized group; at least one curative package; and optionally, at least one additional filler,<br>
optionally, at least one cross-linking agent, optionally, at least one processing aid, optionally, at least one plastomer; or optionally, mixtures thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] Various specific embodiments, versions and examples of the invention will now be described, including preferred embodiments and definitions that are adopted herein for purposes of understanding the claimed invention. For determining infringement, the scope of the "invention" will refer to any one or more of the appended claims, including their equivalents, and elements or limitations that are equivalent to those that are recited.<br>
[0016] As used herein, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups is used as set forth in CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING NEWS, 63(5), 27 (1985).<br>
[0017] As used herein, a polymer may be used to refer to homopolymers, copolymers, interpolymers, terpolymers, etc. Likewise, a copolymer may refer to a polymer comprising at least two monomers, optionally with other monomers.<br>
[0018] As used herein, when a polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the monomer is present in the polymer in the polymerized form of the monomer or in the derivative form the monomer. Likewise, when catalyst components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it is well understood by one skilled in the art, that the ionic form of the component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers.<br>
[0019] As used herein, when a modified layered filler is described as comprising certain components, those components are present in their synthesized form or derivative form (i.e., recognizing, for example, the chemical and physical interactions between the components such as those between the layered fillers and<br>
modifying agents) and/or the changes that might occur during the synthesis of the modified layered clay.<br>
[0020] As used herein, when a nanocomposite is described as comprising certain components, those components are present in their synthesized form or derivative form (i.e., recognizing, for example, the chemical and physical interactions between the components such as those between the elastomers and modified layered fillers and other components) and/or the changes that might occur during the synthesis of the nanocomposite.<br>
[0021] As used herein, elastomer or elastomeric composition, as used herein, refers to any polymer or composition of polymers (such as blends of polymers) consistent with the ASTM D1566 definition. Elastomer includes mixed blends of polymers such as melt mixing and/or reactor blends of polymers. The terms may be used interchangeably with the term "rubber(s)."<br>
[0022] As used herein, phr is parts per hundred rubber, and is a measure common in the art wherein components of a composition are measured relative to a major elastomer component, based upon 100 parts by weight of the elastomer(s) or rubber(s).<br>
[0023] As used herein, isobutylene based elastomer or polymer refers to elastomers or polymers comprising at least 70 mol % repeat units from isobutylene.<br>
[0024] As used herein, isoolefin refers to any olefin monomer having at least one carbon having two substitutions on that carbon.<br>

[0027] As used herein, intercalation refers to the state of a composition in which a polymer is present between each layer of a platelet filler. As is recognized in the industry and by academia, some indicia of intercalation can be the shifting and/or weakening of detection of an X-ray lines as compared to that of original platelet fillers, indicating a larger spacing between vermiculite layers than in the original mineral.<br>
[0028] As used herein, exfoliation refers to the separation of individual layers of the original particle, so that polymer surrounds each particle, hi an embodiment, so much polymer is present between each platelet, that the platelets may be randomly spaced. For example, some indication of exfoliation or intercalation may be a plot showing no X-ray lines or larger d-spacing because of the random spacing ore increased separation of layered platelets as discussed in more detail below. However, as recognized in the industry and by academia, other indicia may be useful to indicate the results of exfoliation such as permeability testing, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, etc.<br>
[0029] As used herein, solvent refers to any substance capable of dissolving another substance. When the term solvent is used it may refer to at least one solvent or two or more solvents unless specified, hi certain embodiments, the solvent is polar; in other embodiments, the solvent is non-polar.<br>
[0030] As used herein, solution refers to a uniformly dispersed mixture at the molecular level or ionic level, of one or more substances (solute) in one or more substances (solvent). For example, solution process refers to a mixing process that<br>

[0031] As used herein, hydrocarbon refers to molecules or segments of molecules containing primarily hydrogen and carbon atoms. hi some embodiments, hydrocarbon also includes halogenated versions of hydrocarbons and versions containing heteroatoms as discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0032] Permeability testing proceeded according to the following description. All examples were compression molded with slow cooling to provide defect free pads, A compression and curing press was used for rubber samples. Typical thickness of a compression molded pad is around 0.38 mm using an Carver press, 2" diameter disks were then punched out from molded pads for permeability testing. These disks were conditioned in a vacuum oven at 60°C overnight prior to the measurement. The oxygen permeation measurements were done using a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/61 permeability tester at 40°C under the principle of R. A. Pasternak et. al. in Vol. 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE: PART A-2 467 (1970). Disks thus prepared were mounted on a template and sealed with a vacuum grease. A steady flow of oxygen at 10 mL/min was maintained on one side of the disk, while a steady flow of nitrogen at 10 mL/min was maintained on the other side of the disk. Using the oxygen sensor on the nitrogen side, increase in oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side with time could be monitored. The time required for oxygen to permeate through the disk, or for oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side to reach a constant value, is recorded and used to determine the oxygen gas permeability.<br>
[0033] X-Ray testing proceeded according to the following description. X-ray data was collected on two different goniometer configurations. A D/MAX Rapid 2-dimensional detector microdiffraction system, with SAXS beam stop and point source was used for one set of data, and an Ultima HI line source system with SAXS attachment in parallel beam mode was used for the second set of data. The<br>
intensity versus d-spacing plots shown in Figures 1-6 are from the parallel beam point source with SAXS attachment instrument. For this data, the sample was prepared by cutting various sections at different angles with respect to the sample surface in order to decrease effects of preferred orientation, and the parallel beam was used to illuminate the entire sample area. For more information on conducting these and related procedures, please consult the manufacture and operating manual related to the aforementioned equipment.<br>
Elastomer<br>
[0034]       The nanocomposites of the present invention comprise at least one elastomer along with other components described and claimed herein.   In an embodiment, the elastomer may be an interpolymer.   The interpolymer may be random elastomeric copolymers of a €4 to C? isomonoolefms, such as isobutylene and a para-alkylstyrene comonomer, such as para-methylstyrene, containing at least 80%, more alternatively at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer and optionally include functionalized interpolymers wherein at least one or more of the alkyl substituent groups present in the styrene monomer units contain benzylic halogen or some other functional group, hi another embodiment, the interpolymer may be a random elastomeric copolymer of ethylene or a €3 to CG a-olefin and a para-alkylstyrene comonomer, such as para-methylstyrene containing at least 80%, alternatively at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer and optionally include functionalized interpolymers wherein at least one or more of the alkyl substituents groups present in the styrene monomer units contain benzylic halogen or some other   functional   group.      Exemplary   materials   may   be   characterized   as interpolymers containing the following monomer units randomly spaced along the polymer chain<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R and R1 are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, such as a alkyl and primary or secondary alkyl halides and X is a functional group such as halogen. In an embodiment, R and R1 are each hydrogen. Up to 60 mol% of the para-substituted styrene present in the interpolymer structure may be the functionalized structure (1) above in one embodiment, and in another embodiment from 0.1 to 5 mol% of the total monomer units. In yet another embodiment, the amount of functionalized structure (2) is from 0.4 to 2.5 mol% of the total monomer units.<br>
[0035] The functional group X may be halogen or some other functional group which may be incorporated by nucleophilic substitution of benzylic halogen with other groups such as carboxylic acids; carboxy salts; carboxy esters, amides and imides; hydroxy; alkoxide; phenoxide; thiolate; thioether; xanthate; cyanide; cyanate; amino and mixtures thereof. These functionalized isomonoolefin copolymers, their method of preparation, methods of functionalization, and curing methods are more particularly disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,162,445.<br>
[0036] In an embodiment, the elastomer comprises interpolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene containing from 0.5 to 20 mol% para-methylstyrene wherein up to 60 mol% of the methyl substituent groups present on the benzyl ring contain a bromine or chlorine atom, such as a bromine atom (para-(bromomethylstyrene)), as well as acid or ester functionalized versions thereof.<br>
[0037] In another embodiment, the functionality is selected such that it can react or form polar bonds with functional groups present in the matrix polymer, for example, acid, amino or hydroxyl functional groups, when the polymer components are mixed at high temperatures.<br>
[0038] hi certain embodiments, the interpolymers have a substantially homogeneous compositional distribution such that at least 95% by weight of the polymer has a para-alkylstyrene moiety with 10% of the average para-alkylstyrene content of the polymer. Exemplary interpolymers are characterized by a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than 5, alternatively less than 2.5, and an exemplary number average molecular weight in the range of from 25,000 to 750,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography.<br>
[0039] The elastomer such as the interpolymer discussed above may be prepared by a slurry polymerization, typically in a diluent comprising a halogenated hydrocarbon(s) such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon and/or a fluorinated hydrocarbon including mixtures thereof, (see, e.g., WO 2004/058828, WO 2004/058827, WO 2004/058835, WO 2004/058836, WO 2004/058825, PCT/US03/41221 and WO 2004/058829), of the monomer mixture using a Lewis acid catalyst, followed by halogenation, preferably bromination, in solution in the presence of halogen and a radical initiator such as heat and/or light and/or a chemical initiator and, optionally, followed by electrophilic substitution of bromine with a different functional moiety.<br>
[0040] In an embodiment, brominated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) "BIMS" polymers generally contain from 0.1 to 5% mole of bromomemylstyrene groups relative to the total amount of monomer derived units in the polymer, hi another embodiment, the amount of bromomethyl groups is from 0.2 to 3.0 mol%, and from 0.3 to 2.8 mol% in yet another embodiment, and from 0.4 to 2.5 mol% in yet another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 2.0 in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range may be any combination of any upper limit with any lower limit.<br>
Expressed another way, exemplary copolymers contain from 0.2 to 10 wt% of bromine, based on the weight of the polymer, from 0.4 to 6 wt% bromine in another embodiment, and from 0.6 to 5.6 wt% in another embodiment, are substantially free of ring halogen or halogen in the polymer backbone chain. In one embodiment, the interpolymer is a copolymer of €4 to C? isoolefin derived units (or isomonoolefin), para-methylstyrene derived units and para-(halomethylstyrene) derived units, wherein the para-(halomethylstyrene) units are present in the interpolymer from 0.4 to 3.0 mol% based on the total number of para-methylstyrene, and wherein the para-methylstyrene derived units are present from 2 wt% to 25 wt% based on the total weight of the polymer in one embodiment, and from 4 wt% to 15 wt% in another embodiment. In another embodiment, the para-(halomethylstyrene) is para-(bromomethylstyrene).<br>
[0041] In yet another embodiment, the elastomer may comprise a halogenated butyl rubber component, either with the interpolymer or as the only elastomer combined with the exfoliated clay, hi one embodiment of the invention, the halogenated rubber component is a halogenated copolymer of a €4 to Ce isoolefin and a multiolefin. In another embodiment, the halogenated rubber component is a blend of a polydiene or block copolymer, and a copolymer of a isoolefin and a conjugated, or a "star-branched" butyl polymer. The halogenated butyl polymer useful in the present invention can thus be described as a halogenated elastomer comprising  isoolefin derived units, multiolefin derived units, and halogenated multiolefin derived units, and includes both "halogenated butyl rubber" and so called "halogenated star-branched" butyl rubber.<br>
[0042] In one embodiment, the halogenated butyl rubber is brominated butyl rubber, and in another embodiment is chlorinated butyl rubber. General properties and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers is described in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995). Butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl rubbers<br>
are described by Edward Kresge and H.C. Wang in 8 KlRK-OTHMER ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993).<br>
[0043] The halogenated rubber component of the present invention includes, but is not limited to, brominated butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl rubber, star-branched polyisobutylene rubber, star-branched brominated butyl (polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber; isobutylene-bromomethylstyrene copolymers such as isobutylene/meta-bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/para-bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/chloromethylstyrene, halogenated isobutylene cyclopentadiene, and isobutylene/para-chloromethylstyrene, and the like halomethylated aromatic interpolymers as in US 4,074,035 and US 4,395,506; isoprene and halogenated isobutylene copolymers, polychloroprene, and the like, and mixtures of any of the above. Some embodiments of the halogenated rubber component are also described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,703,091 and 4,632,963.<br>
[0044] More particularly, in one embodiment, the elastomer comprises a halogenated butyl rubber. As used herein, "halogenated butyl rubber" refers to both butyl rubber and so-called "star-branched" butyl rubber, described below. The halogenated butyl rubber is produced from the halogenation of butyl rubber. For example, the olefin polymerization feeds employed in producing the halogenated butyl rubber of the invention are those olefinic compounds conventionally used in the preparation of butyl-type rubber polymers. The butyl polymers are prepared by reacting a comonomer mixture, the mixture having at least (1) a C4 to C6 isoolefin monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefin, or conjugated diene, monomer component. The isoolefin is in a range from 70 to 99.5 wt% by weight of the total comonomer mixture in one embodiment, and 85 to 99.5 wt% in another embodiment. The conjugated diene component in one embodiment is present in the comonomer mixture from 30 to 0.5 wt% in one embodiment, and from 15 to 0.5 wt% in another embodiment. In<br>
yet another embodiment, from 8 to 0.5 wt% of the comonomer mixture is conjugated diene.<br>
[0045] The isoolefin is a C4 to Ce compound such as isobutylene, isobutene 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The multiolefin is a C4 toC14 conjugated diene such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, cyclopentadiene, hexadiene and piperylene. One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer of the invention is obtained by reacting 92 to 99.5 wt% of isobutylene with 0.5 to 8 wt% isoprene, or reacting 95 to 99.5 wt% isobutylene with from 0.5 wt% to 5.0 wt% isoprene in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0046] Halogenated butyl rubber is produced by the halogenation of the butyl rubber product described above. Halogenation can be carried out by any means, and the invention is not herein limited by the halogenation process. Methods of halogenating polymers such as butyl polymers are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,631,984, 3,099,644, 4,554,326, 4,681,921, 4,650,831, 4,384,072, 4,513,116 and 5,681,901. In one embodiment, the halogen is in the so called n and IH structures as discussed in, for example, RUBBER TECHNOLOGY at 298-299 (1995). In one embodiment, the butyl rubber is halogenated in hexane diluent at from 40 to 60°C using bromine (Br2) or chlorine (Ch) as the halogenation agent. The halogenated butyl rubber has a Mooney Viscosity of from 20 to 70 (ML 1+8 at 125°C) in one embodiment, and from 25 to 55 in another embodiment. The halogen wt% is from 0.1 to 10 wt% based in on the weight of the halogenated butyl rubber in one embodiment, and from 0.5 to 5 wt% in another embodiment, hi yet another embodiment, the halogen wt% of the halogenated butyl rubber is from 1 to 2.2 wt%.<br>
[0047] In another embodiment, the halogenated butyl or star-branched butyl rubber may be halogenated such that the halogenation is in the primary allylic position. This is typically achieved by such means as free radical bromination or<br>
free radical chlorination, or by such methods as secondary treatment halogenated ubbers, such as by heating the rubber, to form the allylic halogenated butyl and star-branched butyl rubber. Common methods of forming the allylic halogenated polymer are disclosed by in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,632,963,4,649,178, and 4,703,091. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, the halogenated butyl rubber is such that the halogenated multiolefin units are primary allylic halogenated units, and wherein the primary allylic configuration is present to at least 20 mol% (relative to the total amount of halogenated multiolefin) in one embodiment, and at least 30 mol% in another embodiment. This arrangement can be described as follows (3), wherein X is a halogen, desirably chlorine or bromine, and q is at least 60 mol% based on the total moles of halogen in one embodiment, and at least 30 mole% in another embodiment, and from 25 mol% to 90 mol% in yet another embodiment:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0048] A commercial embodiment of the halogenated butyl rubber of the present invention is Bromobutyl 2222 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Baytown, TX).

[0097] In certain embodiments, layered filler is pre-exchanged with above intercalant. The exchanging reaction take places in a solvent system and aided by<br>
mixing or heating. The exchanged filler is then separated from solvent and dried for use in preparation of nanocomposite. The increased d-spacing and weight gain before and after exchanging indicates the formation of modified clay.<br>

Other Components<br>
[00124] One or more additional filler components such as, for example, calcium carbonate, silica, clay and other silicates winch may or may not be exfoliated, talc, titanium dioxide, and carbon black may also be included. Silica is meant to refer to any type or particle size silica or another silicic acid derivative, or silicic acid, processed by solution, pyrogenic or the like methods and having a surface area, including untreated, precipitated silica, crystalline silica, colloidal silica, aluminum or calcium silicates, fumed silica, and the like.<br>
[00125] In one embodiment, the additional filler is carbon black or modified carbon black, and combinations of any of these. In another embodiment, the additional filler may be a blend of carbon black and silica.<br>
[00126] Additional fillers for articles such as tire treads and sidewalls is reinforcing grade carbon black present at a level of from 10 to 100 phr of the blend, more preferably from 30 to 80 phr in another embodiment, and from 50 to 80 phr in yet another embodiment. Useful grades of carbon black, as described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY, 59-85, range from N110 to N990. More desirably, embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example, tire treads are N229, N351, N339, N220, N234 and N110 provided in ASTM (D3037, D1510, and D3765). Embodiments of the carbon black useful in, for example, sidewalls in tires, are N330, N351, N550, N650, N660, and N762. Carbon blacks suitable for innerliners and other air barriers include N550, N660, N650, N762, N990 and Regal 85.<br>
[00127]     The additional filler may be any size and typically ranging, for example, from about 0.0001 fan. to about 100 fan.<br>
[00128]      In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein and the articles made from those compositions may comprise at least one curative package.<br>
As used herein, at least one curative package refers to any material or method capable of imparting cured properties to a rubber as commonly understood in the industry. At least one curative package may include any of the following.<br>
[00129] One or more crosslinking agents, such as a coupling agent, may also be<br>
used, especially when silica is present in combination. The coupling agent may be<br>
a bifunctional organosilane crosslinking agent. An "organosilane crosslinking<br>
agent" is any silane coupled filler and/or crosslinking activator and/or silane<br>
reinforcing agent known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to,<br>
vinyl	triethoxysilane,	vinyl-tris-(beta-methoxyethoxy)silane,<br>
methacryloylpropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-amino-propyl triethoxysilane (sold commercially as All00 by Witco), gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (A189 by Witco) and the like, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, bis-(3-triethoxysilypropyl)tetrasulfide (sold commercially as "Si69") is employed.<br>
[00130] Generally, polymer blends, for example, those used to produce tires, are crosslinked. It is known that the physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are directly related to the number (crosslink density) and type of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. (See, e.g., Kelt et al., The Post Vulcanization Stabilization for NR in RUBBER WORLD, 18-23 (1991)). Generally, polymer blends may be crosslinked by adding curative molecules, for example sulfur, metal oxides, organometallic compounds, radical initiators, etc., followed by heating. In particular, the following metal oxides are common curatives that will function in the present invention: ZnO, CaO, MgO, A12O3, CrOs, FeO, Fe2O3, and NiO. These metal oxides can be used alone or in conjunction with the corresponding metal fatty acid complex (e.g., zinc stearate, calcium stearate, etc.), or with the organic and fatty acids added alone, such as stearic acid, and optionally other curatives such as sulfur or a sulfur compound, an alkylperoxide compound, diamines or derivatives thereof (e.g., DIAK products sold by DuPont). (See also, Formulation Design and Curing Characteristics of NBR<br>
Mixes for Seals, RUBBER WORLD 25-30 (1993)). Tins method of curing elastomers may be accelerated and is often used for the vulcanization of elastomer blends.<br>
[00131] The acceleration of the cure process is accomplished in the present invention by adding to the composition an amount of an accelerant, often an organic compound. The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers. Ideally, all of the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks winch join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix. Numerous accelerators are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the following: stearic acid, diphenyl guanidine (DPG), tetramethyltinuram disulfide (TMTD), 4,4'-ditinodimorpholine (DTDM), tetrabutyltinuram disulfide (TBTD), 2-mercaptobenzotinazole disulfide (MBTS), hexamethylene-l,6-bistinosulfate disodium salt dihydrate (sold commercially as DURALINK™ HTS by Flexsys), 2-(morpholinotino) benzotinazole (MBS or MOR), blends of 90% MOR and 10% MBTS (MOR 90), N-tertiarybutyl-2-benzotinazole sulfenamide (TBBS), and N-oxydiethylene tinocarbamyl-N-oxydiethylene sulfonamide (OTOS), zinc 2-ethyl hexanoate (ZEH), and "tinoureas".<br>
[00132] In one embodiment, the nanocomposite also comprises a curative selected from sulfur, sulfur-based compounds, metal oxides, metal oxide complexes, fatty acids, peroxides, diamines, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00133] In other embodiments, desirable elastomer impermeability is acineved by the presence of at least one polyfunctional curative. An embodiment of such polyfunctional curatives can be described by the formula Z--R7—Z', wherein R7 is substituted or unsubstituted; and Z and Z' are the same or different and are one of a tinosulfate group, mercapto group, aldehyde group, carboxylic acid group, peroxide group, alkenyl group, or other similar group that is capable of crosslinking, either intermolecularly or intramolecularly, one or more strands of a<br>
polymer having reactive groups such as unsaturation. So-called bis-tinosulfate compounds are an example of a class of polyfunctional compounds included in the above formula. Non-limiting examples of such polyfunctional curatives are as hexamethylene bis(sodium tinosulfate) and hexamethylene bis(cinnamaldehyde), and others are well known in the rubber compounding arts. These and other suitable agents are disclosed in, for example, the BLUE BOOK, MATERIALS,<br>
COMPOUNDING INGREDIENTS, MACHINERY AND SERVICES FOR RUBBER (Don. R.<br>
Smith, ed., Lippincott &amp; Petto Inc. 2001). The polyfunctional curative, if present, may be present in the nanocomposite from 0.1 to 8 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 5 phr in yet another embodiment.<br>
