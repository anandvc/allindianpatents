				<td>MANAGING AN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROBLEM<br>
Reference to Microfiche Appendix<br>
An appendix forms part of this application. The<br>
appendix, which includes a source code listing relating<br>
to an embodiment of the invention, includes 223 frames on<br>
4 sheets of microfiche.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to managing an information<br>
retrieval problem.<br>
A computer system (e.g., a World-Wide Web server<br>
connected to the Internet) may store information (e.g.,<br>
Web pages providing product information) expected to be<br>
retrievable by many users,including other computer<br>
systems. Network malfunctions, deliberate sabotage, data<br>
storage failures, software bugs, and the like can cause<br>
problems with such retrieval. Typically, the system is<br>
maintained by a human administrator who attempts to<br>
achieve early warning of such problems by testing<br>
periodically (e.g., hourly) whether the information can<br>
be retrieved. In the case of a World-Wide Web server<br>
connected to the Internet, the administrator accomplishes<br>
such testing by running and directing browser software<br>
such as Netscape® Navigator™ to retrieve and display Web<br>
pages from the server across the Internet.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one general aspect, the invention features<br>
a method of managing a problem with retrieving<br>
information from a computer system. The method includes<br>
automatically generating a request for the information,<br>
testing whether the problem is indicated by a result of<br>
the request, and, based on the testing, automatically<br>
determining whether human intervention is required. Thus<br>
the method eases the burden on a computer system<br>
administrator expected to be vigilant about problems with<br>
retrieving information from the system. If the request<br><br>
is re-sent often (e.g., every five minutes), followed up<br>
if necessary by a notification by, e.g., a paging system,<br>
the administrator is likely to provided with nearly<br>
immediate warning about a serious retrieval problem.<br>
Implementations of this or another aspect of the<br>
invention may include one or more of the following<br>
features. The information may be arranged to be<br>
retrieved across a computer network. The problem may be<br>
categorized or it may be determined whether the problem<br>
is a recurrence, wherein the human intervention<br>
determination may be based on the category of the problem<br>
or on the recurrence determination, respectively. Based<br>
on the testing, a computer program may be automatically<br>
restarted (e.g., in case the result is due to a<br>
difficulty with a testing program), and the human<br>
intervention determination may be based on a result of<br>
the automatic restarting. Thus, the administrator may be<br>
freed from having to intervene in response to detection<br>
of minor or non-recurring problems, or problems that can<br>
be resolved by such a restart.<br>
Generation of the request or retrieval of the<br>
information may be based on Internet browser software or<br>
a feature of a computer program. Thus, if the request is<br>
generated with the same software (e.g., the Internet<br>
browser software) used normally to retrieve the<br>
information, retrieval problems may be accurately<br>
detected.<br>
A response to the request may be received, and at<br>
least a portion of the response may be compared to<br>
control data. The information to be retrieved may<br>
include static data and dynamic data, and a comparison<br>
may be made of only the static data to control data. The<br>
response may include an indicator, and, based on the<br>
indicator, a comparison of a portion of the response to<br>
; control data may be avoided.<br><br>
Depending on the outcome of the human intervention<br>
letermination, an automatic attempt may be made to notify<br>
a person, e.g., as noted above, by a paging system.<br>
Brief Description of the accompanying Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a computer system.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flow diagram of a procedure executed<br>
by the computer system.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. l illustrates a client computer 10 connected<br>
to a server computer 14 by a network 12 such as the<br>
internet or a local-area network based on Internet or<br>
other protocols. The client computer runs browser<br>
software 16 (such as Netscape® Navigator™ version 2.0 or<br>
3.0) that is able to retrieve formatted data (such as<br>
data constituting a World- Wide Web page) from server<br>
application software 18 running on the server computer.<br>
Also running on the client computer are script engine<br>
software 20 that executes according to a script 22, and<br>
monitor software 24. By a procedure 100 illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2, the script engine software and monitor software<br>
operate automatically to detect problems with retrieving<br>
the formatted data from the server application software.<br>
The problems are detected by automatically sending a<br>
request that is expected to provoke a response from the<br>
server application software, determining whether any<br>
response was received, and if so, comparing the response<br>
to a set of control data 26.<br>
The script provides a list of pages of the<br>
formatted data to be tested for detection of problems.<br>
For each page listed, a Uniform Resource Locator string<br>
("URL", i.e., a network address such as<br>
"http://www.uspto.gov/" for the page) and a storage<br>
destination 2 7 (such as a computer file) for the expected<br>
response are specified in the script. Now referring<br>
again to Fig. 2, for each page, at predetermined<br><br>
intervals (such as every five minutes), the script engine<br>
software causes generation of a request based on the URL,<br>
and directs the request to the server application<br>
software (step 110), and the script engine and monitor<br>
software follow up as described below.<br>
The script engine generates the request by-<br>
invoking a page retrieval function 29 (known as<br>
"WWW_OpenURL (qcsURL, qcsSaveAs, dwFlags)") that is<br>
accessible via a Dynamic Data Exchange ("DDE") interface<br>
28 of the browser software. The DDE interface is<br>
described in electronic documents available on the World-<br>
Wide Web at<br>
http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/ddeapi.html, and<br>
incorporated by reference. (DDE is a specification that<br>
allows a software program, here the browser software, to<br>
make certain ones of its functions available for use by<br>
another software program, here the script engine.) In<br>
the invocation, the script engine software sets the<br>
"qcsURL" and "qcsSaveAs" parameters to the URL and<br>
storage destination, respectively, specified in the<br>
script. Note that for performance reasons the browser<br>
software may be configured to retain (in one or more<br>
computer files known collectively as a "cache", which is<br>
not associated with the server application software) and<br>
use a copy of a previous response received to a previous<br>
request that was based on the same URL. Such use could<br>
thwart the purpose of sending the present request, which<br>
purpose is to detect problems with retrieving the<br>
formatted data from the server application software<br>
across the network. Consequently, in the invocation, the<br>
script engine software also sets the "dwFlags" parameter<br>
to direct the browser software to avoid referring to the<br>
cache during handling the retrieval of the expected<br>
response to the present request.<br><br>
After invoking the page retrieval function of the<br>
browser software, the script engine software then<br>
determines whether any response was received (step 120}.<br>
The determination is made by examining a result (known as<br>
"dwServicingWindowID") returned to the script engine<br>
software by the page retrieval function. If the result<br>
is "0x0" or "OxFFFFFFFF", the script engine software<br>
determines that no response was received (which counts as<br>
a warning-level error as described below) and then<br>
proceeds according to step 160 described below.<br>
Otherwise, the script engine software determines<br>
that a response was received and was stored at the<br>
storage destination, and the script engine software<br>
compares the received response to the set of control data<br>
(step 130) . What is included in the set of control data<br>
is predetermined and depends on the characteristics of<br>
the page expected in the received response. For example,<br>
the page may be a static data file (e.g., a text file)<br>
provided to the browser software by the server<br>
application software. If so, a copy of the static data<br>
file serves as the set of control data, and the<br>
comparison involves determining differences between the<br>
received response (i.e., the file specified for<br>
"qcsSaveAs") and the copy of the static data file, an<br>
exact match being expected.<br>
Alternatively, the server application software may<br>
produce the page dynamically, based on a combination of a<br>
template (e.g., indicating "The latest price of XYZ stock<br>
is #sc {XYZ_stock_price} #sc") and dynamic data (e.g.,<br>
representing the price of XYZ stock and replacing<br>
" {XYZ_stock_Price}" in the template), If so, in the<br>
comparison, the script engine software expects an exact<br>
match between the set of control data (which is a copy of<br>
the template) and only a portion of the received<br>
response, because the set of control data does not<br><br>
include a copy of the dynamic data. Which portion the<br>
script engine software is not to compare is bounded in<br>
the template by "#sc" strings (which are not displayed<br>
when the template is used normally to provide a display<br>
on a computer screen).<br>
At the point of comparison, the script engine<br>
software also checks for certain special cases. For<br>
example, the page may constitute two overlaid pages,<br>
where the first page includes blank fields expected to be<br>
filled in by the second page, which includes back end<br>
data 30 (such as an account number or a customer name)<br>
stored by a back-end computer 32. In such a case, the<br>
script engine software checks the received response to<br>
determine whether the blank fields are filled in. In<br>
another example, the received response may not match the<br>
set of control data but may include other expected data,<br>
such as a "try again later" notice that is provided by<br>
the server application software when the back end<br>
computer is temporarily unavailable due to routine<br>
maintenance or a temporary backlog.<br>
Next, it is automatically determined whether the<br>
comparison indicates an error, either catastrophic (i.e.,<br>
meriting immediate attention based on one instance) or<br>
warning-level (i.e., meriting attention only after<br>
multiple consecutive instances) (steps 140, 150.<br>
respectively). If no error is indicated, no action is<br>
taken (until the procedure is executed again) other than<br>
resetting a consecutive-error counter 33 that is stored<br>
in non-volatile memory and that is used as described<br>
below.<br>
A catastrophic error is indicated if an exact<br>
match (or the aforementioned other expected data) is not<br>
found in the received response where expected, which<br>
signifies detection of a problem in that the page has<br>
been deliberately or accidentally replaced or altered.<br><br>
In particular, such an indication is merited due to the<br>
possibility that an unauthorized person (known as a<br>
"hacker", e.g., a disgruntled customer) who aims to cause<br>
detriment to a legitimate sponsor (e.g., a company) of<br>
the page (which, e.g., touts the virtues of the company's<br>
products) has replaced or altered the page (e.g., to<br>
convey negative information about the company). The<br>
sponsor can suffer a detriment even if there is an<br>
accidental alteration attributable to, e.g., garbled data<br>
due to a server computer memory failure where the page<br>
includes important numbers such as customer support or<br>
sales telephone numbers. In addition, a catastrophic<br>
error is indicated if the aforementioned blank fields are<br>
not filled in, which indicates a malfunction in the back-<br>
end computer.<br>
If a catastrophic error is indicated, notification<br>
software 34 (e.g., software linked to a paging system) is<br>
used to notify a person 36 such as a pocket-pager-<br>
equipped network administrator (step 170), for whom the<br>
o received response is retained for subsequent inspection.<br>
No further action is taken until the procedure is<br>
executed again.<br>
On the other hand, a warning-level error is<br>
indicated if no response is received, or if the received<br>
response includes the aforementioned other expected data<br>
such as the "try again later" notice. Such cases do not<br>
lead to an indication of a catastrophic error, because<br>
such cases may not recur immediately despite the lack of<br>
intervention by a person. For example, the lack of a<br>
response may be due to an infrequent network overload or<br>
network data loss.<br>
It is determined whether the warning-level error<br>
is the ninth in a row (based on the consecutive-error<br>
counter), indicating detection of a problem expected to<br>
recur indefinitely until intervention by a person (step<br><br>
160). If so, a person is notified as mentioned above,<br>
and no further action is taken until the procedure is<br>
executed again.<br>
Otherwise, it is determined whether the warning-<br>
level is only the seventh in a row, indicating detection<br>
of a problem that warrants an automated repair attempt<br>
(step 180). If not, no further action is taken until the<br>
procedure is executed again.<br>
On the other hand, if so, an automated repair is<br>
attempted (step 190), wherein the monitor software<br>
directs engine/browser restart agent software 38 to cause<br>
operating system software 40 to shut down and restart the<br>
script engine software and the browser software. The<br>
restarts are executed in case the problem detected is a<br>
result of a malfunction that has developed with<br>
detection, i.e., with the script engine software or the<br>
browser software.<br>
No further action is taken at this point, until<br>
the procedure is executed again. If such restarts do<br>
resolve the problem detected, the consecutive-error<br>
counter is reset as mentioned above when the procedure is<br>
executed again. If resolution (based on the restarts or<br>
otherwise) does not occur within the next two executions<br>
of the procedure, the consecutive-error counter reaches<br>
nine and a person is notified, in accordance with<br>
aforementioned steps 160, 170.<br>
The retrieved page may include text formatted in<br>
accordance with, e.g., a specification known as Hypertext<br>
Markup Language ("HTML"). The browser software may be,<br>
e.g., Netscape® NavigatorTM 2.0 or 3.0 (as mentioned<br>
above) or Microsoft® Internet Explorer 3.0, or any other<br>
software allowing automated page retrieval. The server<br>
computer may include, e.g., a Compaq® ProLiant™ or an<br>
IBM® RS6000 running an operating system such as<br>
5 Microsoft® Windows® NT or IBM® OS/2 or AIX. The network<br><br>
may be based on a protocol such as Transmission Control<br>
Protocol and Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP"). The client<br>
computer may include a personal computer having a<br>
processor such as an Intel® Pentium®. The operating<br>
system may be, e.g., Microsoft® Windows® NT, Microsoft®<br>
Windows®95, UNIX®, OS/2®, or compatible with Java™. The<br>
back end computer may include, e.g., an IBM® 3090 running<br>
an operating system such as IBM® MVS 5.2, or a Pyramid®<br>
NILE™ computer.<br>
The technique (i.e., the procedure described<br>
above) may be implemented in hardware or software, or a<br>
combination of both. Preferably, the technique is<br>
implemented in computer programs (such as the monitor<br>
software and script engine software described above)<br>
executing on programmable computers that each include a<br>
processor, a storage medium readable by the processor<br>
(including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or<br>
storage elements), at least one input device such as a<br>
keyboard, and at least one output device. Program code<br>
is applied to data entered using the input device to<br>
perform the method described above and to generate output<br>
information. The output information is applied to one or<br>
more output devices such as a display screen of the<br>
client computer.<br>
Each program is preferably implemented in a high<br>
level procedural or object-oriented programming language<br>
(such as C in combination with a Borland® International<br>
Delphi™ toolkit) to communicate with a computer system.<br>
However, the programs can be implemented in assembly or<br>
machine language, if desired. In any case, the language<br>
may be a compiled or interpreted language.<br>
Each such computer program is preferably stored on<br>
a storage medium or device (e.g., ROM or magnetic<br>
diskette) that is readable by a general or special<br>
purpose programmable computer for configuring and<br><br>
operating the computer when the storage medium or device<br>
is read by the computer to perform the procedures<br>
described in this document. The system may also be<br>
considered to be implemented as a computer-readable<br>
storage medium, configured with a computer program, where<br>
the storage medium so configured causes a computer to<br>
operate in a specific and predefined manner.<br>
Other embodiments are within the scope of the<br>
following claims. For example, all of the software may<br>
run on (and the script and the set of control data may be<br>
stored at) the server computer, allowing local (i.e., not<br>
network-based) detection of problems with retrieving the<br>
formatted data from the server application software.<br>
However, such an alternative arrangement is likely to<br>
fail to detect such a problem that develops as a result<br>
of a malfunction occurring outside the server computer.<br>
Such a malfunction could be accidental, e.g., with a<br>
security system 44 (known as a "firewall") that governs<br>
network access to the server computer, or could be<br>
deliberate, e.g., involving a hacker's redirection of<br>
URL-based requests away from the server computer and to<br>
another computer 46 on the network.<br>
In another example, on the network, the server<br>
computer may have at least one load-sharing counterpart<br>
server computer (e.g., an IBM® RS6000 running an<br>
operating system such as IBM® OS/2 or AIX) that stores<br>
duplicates of the pages of formatted data stored by the<br>
server computer. In normal use in such a case, when a<br>
URL-based request is generated, the URL (e.g.,<br>
"http://www.uspto.gov/") is generic, i.e., does not<br>
distinguish between the two or more server computers.<br>
Rather, in normal use, the generic URL is transparently<br>
translated into a specific network address that directs<br>
the request to a lesser- or least-burdened of the two or<br>
more server computers. In such a case where the URL is<br><br>
generic, the script engine software deals with each<br>
server computer in turn (e.g., by alternating if there<br>
are only two server computers), using the same script<br>
with each specific network address.<br>
The notification software may cause a person to be<br>
notified by one or more means available, such as<br>
electronic mail, fax, telephone, interoffice mail,<br>
network message, siren, or radio.<br>
Depending on the capabilities of the browser<br>
software, the page of formatted data may include images<br>
as well as text. Thus, a problem is detected if image<br>
data is deliberately or accidentally altered. Also,<br>
time-related problems (e.g., delays) with page retrieval<br>
may be detected, by keeping track of when the request is<br>
sent and when the response is received. A log may be<br>
kept of such times and other details about executions of<br>
the procedure, to allow a detailed analysis of procedure-<br>
related events in general and problems detected in<br>
particular.<br>
The monitor software and the server computer may<br>
be arranged so that the monitor software can cause the<br>
server application software to be shut down and<br>
restarted.<br>
