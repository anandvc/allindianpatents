The present invention relaws to a honeycomh body with ducts through which a fluid is capable of tlowing and which are arranized so as to he next to one another, the honcyeomh body having walls which form duels and are conipused of ceramic. A method for producing a honeycomb body with duels is also provided, the honeycomb body being composed in layers.<br>
It is knovvn that honeycomb bodies are produced from eeramie bv means of extrusion methods, the shape of the honeycomb bodies depending on the mask which is used when a green product is being produced. Ceramic honeycomb bodies of this type, due to the production method. have regular contours of the duct walls passing through the honeycomb body.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a honeycomb body and a method for producing a honeycomb body, by means of which the application range and the possibility for use of the honeycomb body having ceramic walls are increased.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a first and a second method for producing a honeycomb body and by means of' a honeycomb body as herein after described. Advantageous  devclopmcnls  and   features  are  speedfied   in   the  respectively  dependent<br>
claims.<br>
A first method for producir:g a honeycomb body with ilucts provides for the honeycomb body to be composed in layers by the repeated sequence of the steps:<br>
generating a predeicrminabic layer by means of a first  plastically deformable and subsequently consolidatable mass, and consolidating the layer.<br>
A measuring sensor and/or a heating device is  provided by the..<br>
 Aplication of a second electrically conductive mass and/or the insertion of an electrically conductive body inr.o the honeycomb body.<br>
A second method for producing a honeycomo body with ducts provides tor   the honeycomb body to be composed in layers by the repeated sequence of the steps:<br>
generating a predeterminable layer by means of a first "plastically deformable and subsequently consolidatable mass, and<br>
consolidating the layer, walls being composed which form the ducts through which a fluid is capable of   flowing. In this case, one wall is provided with a   structure for influencing the fluid capable of flowing through.<br>
An advantageous development of the first and the second method provides for partially interrupting the layered cpmposition for forming a wall, in order to produce an orifice in the wall as a passage for the fluid frem a first duct to a second duct.<br>
Furthermore, a honeycomb body is provided, hayinq ducts through which a fluid is capable of flowing and which are arranged s*o as to lie next to one another, the honeycomb body having walls which form ducts and are composed of ceramic. The honeycomb body has at least one measuring sensor and/or an electrically conductive mass integrated into a ceramic wall of the honeycomb body.<br>
Advantageously, the measuring sensor and/or the electrically conductive' mass is inteqrated into a wall of the honeycomb body which coforms a duct. On the one han(i, temperatures of the fluid flowing through can be recorded, if the measuring sensor is a temperature sensor, and, on the other hand  the honeycomb body itself can serve as a heating device for the fluid. In order to protect the measuring sensor and/or the electrically conductive mass, these may be surrounded completely by ceramic, so that even an aggressive fluid can flow through the honeycomb body, without any intended<br>
3<br>
ntercalations suffering damage, such as, for example, on account or not gas cprrosion or other chemical reactions.<br>
A further honeycomb body with ducts through which a fluid is capable of flowing and which are arranged so as to lie next to one another has walls which form the ducts and are composed of ceramic, one ceramic wall having an additional structure, in order- to -influence a throughflow of the fluid.<br>
The structure is arranaed longitudinallv. transversely and/or obliquely to a direction of throughflow of the fluid tnrough the duct. In particular, the structure may be wavy or zigzag-shaped.<br>
Another honeycomb body with ducts through which a fluid is capable of flowing, which honeycomb body is produced from a plastically deformable and subsequently consolidatable first mass, the first mass being, in particular in layers, predeterminably applied and consolidated, has along a section through the honeycomb body, next to the first mass, at least one second mass as a layer along the section, the first mass having a property different from that of the second mass.<br>
The features of the respective honeycomb bodies may also be combined with one another, advantageously structures being capable of being arranged in such a way that they assist functions of intercalations in the honeycomb body, whether they be, for example, temperature measurement or heating of the fluid~.' The respective masses used for the honeycomb body are also selected and arranged accordihgly.<br>
One possible way of producing a honeycomb body, as illustrated above, may be gathered from the following description: a honeycomb body with ducts consisting of a pore structure predeterminable in a pattern-like manner, which honeycomb body is produced from a plastically deformable and subsequently  consolidatable first mass, the first mass being, in layers, <br>
4<br>
5<br>
thefirst mass, at least one second mass which forms a predetermined layer in the honeycomb body. A method for producing a honeycomb body of this type having a pore structure predeterminable in a pattern-like manner mav be gathered from EP 0 627 983 Bl, the full content of tho relevant features of which are included herewith. Utilizing a second mass in addition to the first mass has the advantage that different properties can be assigned to the respective masses. This means, for the honeycomb body, that it is in one piece, but can nevertheless have different regions with different properties.<br>
Preferably, the first mass is electrically nonconductive and the second mass electrically conduct'ive. It thereby becomes possible that a honeycomb body can be produced which, for example, allows electrical current to flow through in some portions of its walling, whereas other regions of the walling remain cool. This makes it possible that the honeycomb body may also be divided into various active regions. A first portion serves, for example, as a heating device, a subsequent second portion as an adsorber and a third portion as a catalyst. These portions, listed merely by way of example, may also be interchanged or combined with one another.<br>
The use of at least one first and one second mass also makes it possible for the second mass to be embedded at least partially in the first mass, or the converse may be the case. As regards a possible electrical conductivity of the second mass, there is therefore the possibility of causing electrical conductor tracks to run in the honeycomb body in such a way that they run within a walling of the honeycomb body. Contact between these conductor tracks and the throughflowing fluid as a result of the honeycomb body can be avoided in this way. On the other hand, the use of a suitable first or second mass and the associated possible setting of a desired porosity of the honeycomb body at a particular point make it possioie tnat the fluid can impinge directly onto the electrical conductor track. For example, a chemical property or composition of the<br>
fluid flowing through can be tested in this way. The production method also makes it possible for the honevcomb body to be composed in such a way that a carrying structure of the honeycomb body is composed of the first mass, the second mass being arranged as a layer, for example a catalyst material or adsorber material, in each case at the edges of this carrying structure.<br>
A preferred development provides for a body to be integrated into the honeycomb body. For this purpose, the body can be added to the predetermined location during the layered compo.sition and embedded, if not even surrounded, during the further layered composition of the honeycomb body by the mass used. This is suitable particularly for integrating a measuring sensor into the honeycomb body. Either the measuring sensor is prefabricated and surrounded in layers during the production of the honeycomb body or else the measuring sensor is composed, likewise in layers, simultaneously with the production of the honeycomb body, corresponding masses being used which ultimately yield the measuring sensor. In addition to a measuring sensor, a resistance wire, a resistance layer or another body can also be integrated, in particular as an intercalation, into the honeycomb body in this way.<br>
Furthermore, a honeycomb body with ducts is provided, which is produced from a plastically deformable and subsequently consolidatable first mass. The first mass is, in layers, predeterminably applied and subsequently consolidated. The honeycomb body has a main direction of throughflow along a shortest path. A plur~ality of^Iayers, then, form a predetermined structure at an exactly defined location of the honeycomb body, the structure precalculably prolonging a flow path in a.duct along the main direction of throughflow with respect to a shortest, path. The use of the method referred to above makes it possible that, before being produced, the exact honeycomb body can be calculatea fluidically with extremely high accuracy according to its main field of use, and associated parameters are subjected to a flow-optimized rating<br>
 6<br>
 which covers as wide a region as possible of the operating range of the honeycomb body. The intended prolongation of the main direction of throughflow can therefore be fixed beforehand such that it can also be implemented later in the honeycomb body itself, within the ducts, at the intended location. In particular, it thereby becomes possible to achieve a computationally predetermined desired turbulence in the honeycomb body itself for the set operating point.<br>
In particular, in a development of a honeycomb body, the structure, may be arranged in such a way that it generates a desired, in particular precalculated turbulence and/or diffusion in a duct. Furthermore, the structure may have an interruption in the layers, thus leading to cavities or duct cut-throughs. In this way, ducts, which would otherwise be closed relative to one another in the honeycomb body, can be connected to one another in the honeycomb body at exactly locally defined points, in order thereby to form, for example, in the honeycomb body itself a prolonged path for the fluid flowing through. Moreover, the shortest path along a main direction of throughflow of the honeycomb body is intended to mean the shortest distance between an inlet and an outlet of the honeycomb body. This may run along a longitudinal axis through the honeycomb body or, in the case of a radial throughflow, along a radius through the honeycomb body. Structures and flow angles can then be arranged and composed inside the honeycomb body in a completely freely predeterminable and precalculable way.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of a honeycomb body provides for the structure and/or the duct to be at least partially permeable due to the setting of a porosity of the first mass. This makes it possible for a fluid to penetrate at least partially into the structure or the duct up to a particular depth of the first mass. Only where the porosity becomes so closely packed that the fluid is deflected again because of the high throughflow resistance is it diverted or led further along predetermined paths within the honeycomb body.<br>
 7<br>
 8<br>
 In another development, a predeterminable structure is provided in or on a duct at a predeterminable location in a noneycomb'body as a result of the compos:tion of a plurality of layers, the structure and location having been defined beforehand by means of a turbulence calculation. Advantageously, this turbulence calculation also includes a calculation of the chemical reactions necessary later, for example when the honeycomb body is used as   a catalyst or adsorber. In particular, a honeycomb body, as was described above, can be provided by means of this rnethod.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments and features are ex^Laine.d in more detail with reference to the accompanting drawing. Additional developments are obtained as a result of suitable combinations with one another of the features, disclosed above and below, relating to the honeycomb bodies and to the method. Fn the drawing:<br>
figure 1  shows a diagrammatic illustration of a production method for a honeycomb body,<br>
Figure 2  shows a structure which can be provided, for<br>
example, as a longitudinal or transverse structure in a honeycomb body.<br>
Figure 3  shows a further structure which can likewise be produced by means of a claimed method, and<br>
Fiqur.e A     shows a layered composition of the honeycomb body, into which a body is integrated.<br>
 Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic view of a method for producing a honeycomb body, reference also being made, within the scope or the disclosure, to EP 0 627__983 Bl with regard to the method and also to further features, Ln particular materials used and their properties. Al1 the necessary calculations can be carried out on a computer installation ] before the production<br>
 of the honeycomb body. In particular, turbulence calculations and also -chemical reaction calculations, along with heat calculations and stability calculations, make it possTble, taking into account operating ranges of the honeycomb bOdy, to have the capability of fixing an optimum configuration of the honeycomb body. The design, which is calculated, for example, in this way, making use of structures, is then transferred into a corresponding suitable manufacturing machine 2, for exampfle simultaneously, by the computer installation 1. The manufacturing machine 2 travels correspondingly over a manufacturing table 3, for example by means of the coordinate system indicated. At   the same time, the precalculated layers and structures are formed and consolidated. A honeycomb body 4 is illustrated, in the process of being formed, on the manufacturing table 3. Ducts 5, depicted by dotted lines, run along the longitudinal axis through the honeycomb body 4. A first side 6 of the honeycomb body 4 defines an entrance for a fluid subsequently flowing through the honeycomb body "4, whilst a second side 7, not yet finished, defines a corresponding exit for the fluid. Intercalated into the walls 8 of the honeycomb body 4 are a first 9 and a second 10 bodv which, during the further finishing of the honeycomb body, are integrated: into the latter. As illustrated, the two bodies 9, 10 are inserted at the intended points during manufacture. This is also possible in the inner walls 8 of the honeycomb body 4. In addition to the composition of cross-sectional disks, it is also possible, in the case of appropriate consolidation, to compose the honeycomb body 4 horizontally, for example with the aid of a corresponding mold, in which the honeycomb body is made. This type of manufacture is appropriate particularly when long bodies are to be intercalated and integrated into the honeycomb body 4.<br>
Figure 2 shows a duct walling 11 which is structured. In addition to straight smooth portions B, there are corrugations 12, the amplitude C or wavelength D~of which can be freely determined and produced according to requirements. The distances between the corrugations, identified here by E, can<br>
9<br>
also -be produced individually for the intended use of the honeycomb body, without having regard to a manufacturing tool. The duct wallinq 11, the cross section of which is illustrated here, may have this structure as a longitudinal or transverse structure to the main direction of throughflow and also as a mixture between a pure transverse or longitudinal structure. The duct walling also has, in addition to the actual structure,' a further structure which is in the form of a first 13 and a second 14 elevation and which is arranged in the flow path in order to generate turbulence. The shape of the structure can be configured freely, depending on its respective intended use. Thus, the first and/or second elevation 13, 14   may have inside them a measuring sensor 15 which consequently projects into the fluid stream. Whilst the measuring sensor 15 is in direct contact with the fluid stream at the first elevation 13, the measuring sensor 15 in the second elevation 14 is completely surrounded by material of the second elevation 14 and is therefore shielded against the fluid flowing through. Also apparent is the arrangement of a second mass 17 which is integrated in a first mass 16 of the duct waTling 11 and which is electrically conductive and transmits the signals from the measuring sensor 15 through the honeycomb body 4.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second duct walling 18 which, again, is structured. A first structure 19 in the form of an open triangular serration has interruptions in the layers of which the second duct wallina 19 is composed. The method using a plastically deformable and subsequently consolidatable mass makes it possible that a further second structure 20 can be provided as a microstructure in the first structure 19. The second structure 20 is arranged, for example as an indentation or protuberance, in the first structure 19, as a longitudinal 21 and a transverse 22 structure, the longitudinal structure 21 haying an orifice 23, so as to serve as a passage from one duct into an adjacent duct. In particular, the layered composition of the second duct wallinq 18 makes it possible for both a first height H of the open triangle and a second<br>
10<br>
height h of the second structure 20 to be freely adjustable according to requirements. The same also applies to the respective thickness of the duct walling 18 which, in this exemplary embodiment, is composed of a first 24, second 25 and third 26 layer. The first 24 and the third 26 layer are produced from a first mass, whilst the second layer 25, which is embedded between the other two, consists of a second mass which is electrically conductive. It thereby becomes possible for the duct walling 18 to be fully heated, in order thereby to heat up a fluid flowing through, as indicated by the arrows.<br>
In the formation of orifices and of other structures interrupted in the direction of the layered composition, it must, of course, be remembered that a layer cannot be composed without a base. Consequently, either auxiliary structures must be used instead of the later orifices {for example, made from material which is later burnt or melted away) or the edges of the orifices must run obliquery, so "that a layered composition by means of laterally projecting layers is possible.<br>
The consolidation of the first and the second mass makes it possible that geometries and consequently structures can be . freely formed. In particular, ceramic raw materials, and also metallic raw materials, which may also be connected to one another, come under consideration as materials for the first and second mass. Examples which may be mentioned of ceramic raw materials are oxide ceramics, but also metal ceramics, and of metallic raw materTafs, metal powder, metal oxides or metal solutions, as have also already become known individually hitherto for honeycomb bodies to be sintered. However, these can now be connected to one another by being applied together or being intermixed, in each case in individual layers. The former may also be gathered, for example, from the following Figure 4.<br>
Figure 4 shows a third body 28 integrated into a third duct walling 27. The integration of the third body 28 into the<br>
11<br>
third duct wallina 27 was carried out in that, initially, a first mass was applied and consolidated in layers. After a particular layer height was reached, a second mass was also used in the composition Df the subsequent layers. After a height of the second mass satisfactory for the intended use was reached, once again only the first mass was used for the further layers. It becomes possible in this way for the second mass to be surrounded completely by the first mass and consequently to be embedded and integrated in the latter. The second mass forms a cross here, such as could be necessary, for example, for a distributor of an electrical current within a hon-eycomb body. Highly diverse conductor tracks or the like can be produced by means of an appropriate distribution of the second mass during the production of the honeycomb body to compose the layers of the latter. Cavities can also be implemented in the honeycomb body produced in layers in this way, and, because of the nature of the method used, very fine ducts of between 15 and 50 micrometers can be formed as duct structures, in the honeycomb body, In particular, the m.ethod makes it possible that individual layer heights of about 1.5 to 4 micrometers up to more than 100 micrometers can be composed. This means, in turn, that a surface quality of the honeycomb body and of the structures of the ducts themselves can be precalculable in a locally exactly defined manner and can then be implemented. Desired materials can thereby also be applied in- the predeterminable thickness exactly at the calculated location.<br>
The method for producing the honeycomb body and the nature of the honeycomb body itself make it possible to implement intercalations and flow-influencing structCtures ot any kind particularly in honeycomb bodies composed completely of ceramic. A honeycomb body of this type is suitable, for example, for use in exhaust lines, for example as an adsorber or catalyst, preferably in internal combustion engines of motor vehicles.<br>
