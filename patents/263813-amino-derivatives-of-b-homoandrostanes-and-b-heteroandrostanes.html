HETEROANDROSTANES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new aminoalkoxyimino derivatives at<br>
position 3 of substituted B-homoandrostanes and B-heteroandrostanes,<br>
processes for their preparation, and to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, such as<br>
heart failure and hypertension.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cardiovascular diseases are still the first cause of morbidity and mortality<br>
in the western world." among these, hypertension and heart failure are two<br>
of the most frequent diseases. Hypertension is one of the most important<br>
cardiovascular risk factors and more than one third of population over 60<br>
suffer from this disease. Congestive heart failure affects 1-2% of the<br>
population and even 10% of the very elderly; the percentage is expected to<br>
rise (Sharpe N., et al., The Lancet, 1998, 352, (suppl. 1), 3-11). Beside,<br>
hypertension may be one of the most important causes of heart failure in<br>
the elderly {Eur. Heart J., 2001, 22, 1527-1560). Although a number of<br>
effective drugs are available for the treatment of both hypertension and<br>
heart failure, further research is in progress to find more effective and safe<br>
compounds. Several drugs are used in combination for the treatment of<br>
heart failure, and among positive inotropic agents, digoxin is the most<br>
prescribed digitalis cardiac glycoside that can improve the myocardial<br>
performance. A very well-known drawback of digitalis drugs is their<br>
arrhythmogenic side-effect. Evidence of digitalis toxicity emerges at two- to<br>
three-fold higher serum concentration than the therapeutic dose, such as<br>
disturbances of conduction and cardiac arrhythmias which are<br>
characteristics of digitalis toxicity {Hoffman, B. F.; Bigger, J. T., Digitalis<br>
and Allied Cardiac Glycosides. In The Pharmacological Basis of<br>
Therapeutics, 8th ed.,' Goodman Gilman, A.; Nies, A. S.;Ball, T. W.; Taylor,<br>
P., Eds.; Pergamon Press, New York, 1990, pp 814-839).<br>
The capability of the natural digitalis compounds to increase the myocardial<br>
force of contraction is strictly related to their cardenolide structure having a<br>
17ß-lactone on a 14-hydroxy-5ß,14ß-androstane skeleton.<br>
In the field of 5a,14a_androstane derivatives some groups of compounds are<br>
reported to possess positive inotropic properties.<br>
GB 1,175,219 and US 3,580,905 disclose 3-<br>
(aminoalkoxycarbonylalkylene) steroid derivatives which possess digitalis-<br>
like activities with "a ratio between the dose which produces toxic<br>
symptoms (onset of cardiac arrhythmias) and the effective dose comparable<br>
with such a ratio as measured for standard cardiac glycosides". Besides no<br>
clear advantage over digitalis glycosides, the compounds with the highest<br>
ratio produce the lowest increase in contractile force.<br>
6-Hydroxy and 6-oxoandrostane derivatives are disclosed in EP 0 825 197<br>
Bl as ligands and inhibitors of Na+, K+-ATPase, and positive inotropic<br>
agents possessing a lower toxicity when compared with digoxin, as<br>
evaluated on the basis of the acute toxicity in mice. The same compounds<br>
are also reported by S. De Munari, et al, J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46(17), 3644-<br>
3654.<br>
The evidence that high levels of endogenous ouabain (EO), a closely related<br>
isomer of ouabain, are implicated in human hypertension and cardiac<br>
hypertrophy and failure stimulated the pharmacological research for<br>
developing novel anti-hypertensive agents active as ouabain antagonists.<br>
The pathogenetic mechanisms through which increased EO levels affect<br>
cardiovascular system involve the modulation of Na-K ATPase, the key<br>
enzyme responsible for renal tubular sodium reabsorption and the<br>
activation of signaling transduction pathways implicated in growth-related<br>
gene transcription. By studying both genetic and experimental rat models of<br>
hypertension and comparing them with humans, it has been demonstrated<br>
that elevated levels of circulating EO and the genetic polymorphism of the<br>
cytoskeletal protein adducin associate with hypertension and high renal<br>
Na-K pump activity. Ouabain itself induces hypertension and up-regulates<br>
renal Na-K pump when chronically infused at low doses into rats (OS). In<br>
renal cultured cells, either incubated for several days with nanomolar<br>
concentrations of ouabain or transfected with the hypertensive adducin<br>
genetic variant, the Na-K pump results enhanced. Moreover, both EO and<br>
adducin polymorphism affect cardiac complications associated to<br>
hypertension, the former through the activation of a signalling transduction<br>
pathway. As a consequence, a compound able to interact with the cellular<br>
and molecular alterations, sustained by EO or mutated adducin, may<br>
represent the suitable treatment for those patients in whom these<br>
mechanisms are at work (Ferrandi M et al., Curr Pharm Des.<br>
2005;ll(25):3301-5).<br>
As reported above, the crucial point of positive inotropic agents is the ability<br>
to discriminate between the potency in inducing an increase of myocardial<br>
force of contraction and the onset of cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
There is still a constant need to make available drugs showing a better<br>
therapeutic ratio and/or a longer duration of action, both of them important<br>
factors for the compliance of patients. Preferably, such drugs should be<br>
suitable for oral administration.<br>
Different steroids, with the B ring enlarged and/or with one carbon atom<br>
replaced by a heteroatom, are reported to possess different pharmacological<br>
activities as well as some action on the Na+,K+-ATPase or as diuretics.<br>
3-Hydroxy and 3-keto B-homoandrostane derivatives are disclosed in JP<br>
45023140, as anabolic and antiandrogenic steroids, and in US 3059019 and<br>
by H. J. Ringoldin J. Am. Chew. Soc., 1960, 82, 961-963, as anabolic and<br>
antigonadotrophic compounds.<br>
Natural or synthetic brassinolides (2,3-dihydroxy-6-keto-7-oxa-7a-homo<br>
derivatives) are reported to be plant growth regolators (CS 274530) and<br>
some of them are inhibitors or stimulators of Na+,K+-ATPase (L. Starka, et<br>
al, Sbornik Lekarski, 1997, 98, 21-28).<br>
6-Azaestranes are claimed in US 3,328,408 as diuretic and hypoglycemic<br>
agents and hence useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure.<br>
Compounds resembling steroidal structures with an oxygen atom in the B<br>
ring are reported by R. K. Razdan et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1976, 19, 719-<br>
721, as inactive or almost inactive agents in hypertensive rats, even though<br>
their dosage was quite high (10 mg/kg).<br>

Compounds of general formula (III) and (IV) are commercially available or<br>

procedures.<br>
A method of treating a mammal suffering from a cardiovascular disorder,<br>
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
of Formula (I) as described above represents one of the aspects of the<br>
present invention. The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used<br>
herein refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent needed to treat,<br>
ameliorate a targeted disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable<br>
therapeutic effect.<br>
For any compound, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated<br>
initially either in cell culture assays or in animal models, usually mice, rats,<br>
guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, or pigs.<br>
The animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate<br>
concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then<br>
be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans.<br>
The precise effective dose for a human subject will depend upon the severity<br>
of the disease state, general health of the subject, age, weight, and gender of<br>
the subject, diet, time and frequency of administration, drug combination<br>
(s), reaction sensitivities, and tolerance/response to therapy. This amount<br>
can be determined by routine experimentation and is within the judgement<br>
of the clinician. Generally, an effective dose will be from 0.01 mg/kg to 100<br>
mg/kg, preferably 0.05 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg. Compositions may be<br>
administered individually to a patient or may be administered in<br>
combination with other agents, drugs or hormones.<br>
The medicament may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for<br>
administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include antibodies and<br>
other polypeptides, genes and other therapeutic agents such as liposomes,<br>
provided that the carrier does not itself induce the production of antibodies<br>
harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which may be<br>
administered without undue toxicity.<br>
Suitable carriers may be large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as<br>
proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric<br>
amino acids, amino acid copolymers and inactive virus particles.<br>
A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers is available in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co. , N. J.1991).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers in therapeutic compositions may<br>
additionally contain liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol.<br>
Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents,<br>
pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present in such compositions.<br>
Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as<br>
tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions,<br>
and the like, for ingestion by the patient.<br>
Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered<br>
directly to the subject. The subjects to be treated can be animals; in<br>
particular, human subjects can be treated.<br>
The medicament of this invention may be administered by any number of<br>
routes including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-<br>
arterial, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal or<br>
transcutaneous applications, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal,<br>
enteral, topical, sublingual, intravaginal, rectal means or locally on the<br>
diseased tissue after surgical operation.<br>
Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose<br>
schedule.<br>
Further object of the present invention is the use of said compounds of<br>
general formula (I) in the preparation of a medicament useful in the<br>
treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and<br>
hypertension.<br>
Since the compounds of the present invention are shown to be able to<br>
antagonize the molecular effects induced by nanomolar ouabain<br>
concentrations on the Na-KATPase, they will be effective in the treatment<br>
of the diseases caused by the hypertensive effects of endogenous ouabain.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the the diseases<br>
caused by the hypertensive effects of endogenous ouabain include1 renal<br>
failure progression in autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease<br>
(ADPKD), preeclamptic hypertension and proteinuria and renal failure<br>
progression in patients with adducin polymorphisms.<br>
In autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease (ADPKD), cyst formation<br>
and enlargement are due to cell proliferation and transepithelial secretion of<br>
fluids, causing progressive impairment renal function and kidney failure. 1<br>
over 1000 subjects are affected by ADPKD which represents the first genetic<br>
cause of renal failure. Renal Na-K ATPase is essential for ion and fluid<br>
transport in ADPKD cells and its mislocation and function alteration have<br>
been described in this pathology (Wilson PD et al. Am J Pathol 2000;<br>
156:253-268). Ouabain, the inhibitor of the Na-KATPase, inhibits fluid<br>
secretion in ADPKD cysts (Grantham JJ et al. I Clin. Invest. 1995; 95:195-<br>
202) at micromolar concentrations, conversely, at nanomolar concentrations,<br>
which are similar to the circulating endogenous ouabain ones, ouabain<br>
stimulates ADPKD cell proliferation but does not affect normal human<br>
kidney cell growth (Nguyen AN et al. 2007; 18:46-57). It has been<br>
demonstrated that ouabain stimulates ADPKD proliferation by binding to<br>
the Na-KATPase with high affinity and triggering the activation of the<br>
MEK-ERK pathway (Nguyen AN et al. 2007; 18:46-57).<br>
Preeclampsia is a potential devastating disorder of hypertension in<br>
pregnancy for which an effective treatment is still lacking. Elevated<br>
circulating levels of cardenolides and bufodienolides have been reported in<br>
preeclamptic patients and in rat models of the disease (Lopatin DA et al J.<br>
Hypertens. 1999;17:1179-1187; Graves SV et al. Am J Hypertens. 1995;<br>
8:5-11; Adair CD et al. Am J Nephrol. 1996; 16:529-531). The data available<br>
suggest that in preeclampsia elevated plasma concentrations of Na-K<br>
ATPase inhibitors lead to vasoconstriction and malignant hypertension (Vu<br>
HV et al. Am J Nephrol. 2005; 25:520-528). Recently, Digoxin-specific Fab<br>
(Digibind) have been proved to reduce blood pressure and increase<br>
natriuresis in preeclamptic patients (Pullen MA al.JPET 2004; 310:319-<br>
325).<br>
Glomerulosclerosis-associated proteinuria is due to an impairment of the<br>
slit-pore structure formed by the podocyte foot-processes in the glomerulus.<br>
In particular, slit diaphragm proteins such as nephrin, ZOl, podocyn,<br>
synaptopodin and others, in addition to their structural functions<br>
participate in common signaling pathways regulated by Fyn a tyrosin<br>
kinase of the Src family kinases ( Benzing T. J Am Soc Nephrol 2004;<br>
15-1382-1391). Recently, a key role in the structure of the slit pore has been<br>
ascribed to beta adducin, a cytoskeletal protein under the control of Fyn<br>
(Gotoh H BBRC 2006; 346:600-605; Shima T et al. JBC 2001; 276: 42233-<br>
42240). Adducin polymorphisms joint to that of ACE have been found<br>
associated to impaired renal function in European and Chinese populations<br>
(Wang JG et al. J Mol Med 2004; 82:715-722; Wang JG et al. Am J Kidney<br>
Dis. 2001; 38: 1158-1168). Rostafuroxin and analogues, as endogenous<br>
ouabain antagonists, have been described to be able to antagonize the<br>
molecular effect of adducin polymorphism on tyrosin kinase signaling<br>
(Ferrandi M. et al. JBC.2004; 279:33306-14; Ferrari et al.Am J Physiol<br>
Regul 2006; 290:R5-29-535; Ferrari P. et al. Med Hypothes. 2007; 68:1307-<br>
1314).<br>

combination with excipients and/or pharmacologically acceptable diluents.<br>
The compositions in question may, together with the compounds of formula<br>

A further embodiment of the invention is a process for the preparation of<br>

Biological Studies and Results<br>
The compounds of the present invention show affinity and inhibit the<br>
enzymatic activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase. To test the inhibition of the<br>
activity, the Na+,K+-ATPase was purified according to Jorghensen<br>
(Jorghensen P., BBA, 1974, 356, 36) and Erdmann (Erdmann E. et al.,<br>
Arzneim.Forsh., 1984, 34, 1314) and the inhibition was measured as % of<br>
hydrolysis of 32P-ATP in the presence and absence of the tested compounds<br>
(Mall F. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1984, 33, 47; see Table 1). As reference<br>
compound 22b ((EZ) 3-(2-aminoethoxyimino)androstane-6,17-dione<br>
hydrochloride) is reported, already described by S. De Munari et al. in J.<br>
Med. Chem. 2003, 46(17), 3644-3654.<br>
The ability of these compounds to lower blood pressure was tested by using<br>
animal models with genetic arterial hypertension, in particular,<br>
spontaneous hypertensive rats of the Milan (MHS) (Bianchi G., Ferrari P.,<br>
Barber B.The Milan Hypertensive strain. In Handbook of hypertension.<br>
Vol.4: Experimental and genetic models of hypertension. Ed. W. de jong-<br>
Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.,1984: 328-349) and rats made hypertensive<br>
by chronic infusion of ouabain, according to Ferrari P., et a J. J. Pharm. Exp.<br>
Ther. 1998, 285, 83-94.<br>
The procedure adopted to test the antihypertensive activity of the<br>
compounds on the above mentioned model was the following: systolic blood<br>
pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by an indirect tail-cuff<br>
method.<br>
To test the compounds in the MHS model one-month old hypertensive rats<br>
(MHS) were subdivided in two groups of at least 7 animals each, one<br>
receiving the compound and the other, the control group, receiving only the<br>
vehicle. The compound, suspended in Methocel 0.5% (w/v), was<br>
administered daily by mouth, for five weeks. SBP and HR were measured<br>
weekly 6 hours after the treatment.<br>
The compounds of the present invention possess a higher potency and<br>
efficacy compared to compound 22b ((EZ) 3-(2-<br>
aminoethoxyimino)androstane-6,17-dione hydrochloride) reported by S. De<br>
Munari et al. in J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46(17), 3644-3654. The activity of the<br>
reference compound 22b and some new compounds in lowering blood<br>
pressure in spontaneous hypertensive MHS rats is shown in the following<br>
table and is expressed as the decrease in systolic blood pressure (expressed<br>
both as decrease in mmHg and percentage) and the variation of heart rate<br>
(beats per minute) at the end of the five week treatment period, versus the<br>
control group which received only the vehicle.<br>
SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE FALL IN SPONTANEOUS<br>
HYPERTENSIVE RATS (MHS)<br><br>
As further demonstration of the blood pressure lowering effect in<br>
hypertensive ouabain-sensitive rats, the compound, suspended in Methocel<br>
0.5% (w/v), was administered daily at the dose of 10 µg/kg/day by mouth for<br>
four weeks. SBP and HR were measured weekly 6 hours after the<br>
treatment.<br>
Moreover the compounds of the present invention possess positive inotropic<br>
features, as shown by slow intravenous infusion in anesthetized guinea pig<br>
according to Cerri et al. (Cerri A. et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 2332) and<br>
have a low toxicity when compared with standard cardiotonic steroids, e.g.<br>
digoxin. The compounds of the present invention possess a higher potency<br>
and/or a better therapeutic ratio and/or a longer duration of action<br>
compared to compound 22b ((EZ) 3-(2-aminoethoxyimino)androstane-6,17-<br>
dione hydrochloride) reported by S. De Munari et al. in J. Med. Chem. 2003,<br>
46(17), 3644-3654.<br>
The activity of compounds I-ba and I-bk on the above mentioned tests is<br>
shown in the following Table 2. The inotropic effect is shown as maximum<br>
increase in contractile force (Emax measured as +dP/dTmax), dose inducing<br>
maximum positive inotropic effect (EDmax), inotropic potency (ED80, dose<br>
increasing +dP/dTmax by 80%); the toxicity as the ratio between lethal dose<br>
and inotropic potency (calculated in the died animals); the maximum dose<br>
infused in the survived animals; the duration of the inotropic effect as the<br>
decrease of the effect from the EDmax measured 20 minutes after the end of<br>
the infusion.<br>
Table 2. Inotropic Effect and Lethal Dose in Anesthetized Guinea-pig.<br><br>
As reported in Table 2, compounds I-ba and I-bk show positive inotropic<br>
effects with higher safety ratios than those displayed by digitoxin and<br>
compd 22b. In fact the lethal dose/EDgo ratio is not determinable, since no<br>
animals died. Further, I-ba and I-bk have prolonged action as shown by the<br>
persistence of the inotropic effect after stopping the infusion. Higher doses<br>
were not tested for I-ba and I-bk since their maximum increase in<br>
contractile force were higher than those displayed by digoxin and compd<br>
22b.<br>
