				<td>AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF HYDROGENATED ROSIN AND ITS ESTERS<br>
This invention perticularly relates to an improved process for the manufacture of Hydrogenated Rosin and its Esters, using easily preparable, low cost, base metal caitalyst such as Raney Nickel, at quite low pressure, using a mixture of hydrogen and an inert gas like nitrogen available commercially at much lower price than pure hydrogen. The catalyst used is recovered through a sedimentation centrifuge instead of by settling forlong hours. The catalyst can be recycled a number of times and finally reused for making fresh catalyst.<br>
Rosin consists of mainly abietic type acids, small amount of pi-maric type acids in addition to little amount of non-acidic components such as rosin acid esters, anhydrides, aldehydes, hydrocarbons, unsaponifiable matter and fatty acids. It is sensitive to atmospheric oxidation due to the presence of conjugated double bonds in the molecules of abietic type acids. The pimaric type acids present are relatively inert. The arial oxidation causes rosin to darken embrittle and less soluble in low solvency solvents thereby making it of lower value for most uses.One of the most satisfactory methods of making it resistant to air oxidation and getting a product of light colour is by hydrgenation. The hydrogenated products prepared by the process of the invention are light in colour, highly resistant to atmospheric oxidation and find<br><br>
application in highly specialized adhesives,  surgical  tapes, synthetic rubber, chewing gum, high grade paper etc.<br>
The esters of hydrogenated rosin are equally important and are rather more suited for speciality applications where resistance to air oxidation and discolouration by heat are required. Such applications are pressure sensitive adhesives made from synthetic rubber, chewing gum and hot melt applied coatings. Some of the common esters in demand are those of glycerol, pentaerythritol, methanol etc.<br>
The hydrogenation reactions are presented in Figs I and II. Hydrogenation decreases the two double bonds present in the rosin acids from 74 to 3% and increases the dihydroacids from 1 to 75%, hence'an overall conversion of former to the hydrogenated rosin. Further hydrogenation completely eliminates the double bonds of rosin acids thereby producing to the extent of 1-14% dihydro acids and 66-8 0% tetrahydroacids to give highly or perhydrogenated rosin as shown in Table I.<br><br>
TABLE - I<br>
Double bonds present in hydrogenated Rosin Acids<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Hydrogenation has been carried out by using different types of catalysts with or without the presence of solvents. Among the catalysts reported are:<br>
1.	Noble metal catalysts, such as Pt02 or Pd/c, Rh/c, Ru/c used individally or in combination.<br>
2.	Base metal catalysts, such as Ni.Mn.Si alloy, Ni-Si al 1 oy or Raney Nickel.<br>
Most of the catalysts reported have been used for hydrogenating rosin as well as its esters.<br><br>
Noble metal catalysts<br>
E.D. schulz (Hercules Power Co.), U.S. Pat. 2,346, 793, (1944) has reported that the reaction can be accomplised at atmospheric pressure at 20-30°C, using Pt02 as catalyst, in presence of acetic acid and H3Po4 but the catalyst concentration reported is as high as 30-75%, which is very high, A.L. Grasebrook (Hercules Power Co.), U.S. Pat.2, 776,276, Jan. 1957, carried out the reaction at 3000-5000 Psi, using 5% Pd/c at a concentration of 2%, eleminating the use of solvent. I.I. Bradysher and E.B. Smirnova, Gidrolizn, i, Lesokhim prom. 19(4), 4-6, 1966 (Russ), has reported an optimum pressure of 50 kg/cm2 at a palladium concentration of 0.3% which corresponds to 6% concentration of 5% Pd/c in presence of solvent like hydrogen saturated gasoline. Here again the catalyst concentration as well as pressure are high and the saturation obtained is to the removal of one double bond only. Zhao, Shoupu; et.al. Linchan Huaxve yu Gongye 1981,1(1), 1-12 (ch) have reported hydrogenation of rosin to a saturation of one double bond only on a continuous scale in a fixed bad reactor using 5% Pd/c as catalyst at 220-250°C and 130 kg/cm2 pressure. Here again the catalyst cncentration and pressure are high and hydrogenation partial only. Saving kh V.I., et.al, Gidroliz, Lesokhim, Promst 1992(3), 19-20(Russ) have used palladium containing catalyst 1KT3-31 for hydrogenation of Rosin at 13 0°C and 0.5-1.5 MPa H2 pressure But the product obtained still contained
 <br>
Chinese Academy of forest science, Lin yeh K'oH such, 1979, 15(4), 269-75(ch), have also reported hydrogenation of rosin in presence of 0.01 % catalyst (5% Pd/c) at 270°C, but the hydrogen pressure used was quite high, around 179 kg/cm2, corresponding to 100kg/cm2, initial cold pressure at 3 0°C. Recently Zhang, yunming et.al. in their patent Faming Zhuanli shenging Gongkai shuoming shu CN 1,097,448 (cl.C09Fl/04) 18 Jan, 1995 have reported the use of Palladium 0.05 % /c as catalyst. They obtained dihydrogenated rosin at 4-6 MPa at 150-170°C and tetrahydrogenated rosin at 7-10 MPa and 175-2 00°C.<br>
On the whole the concentration of 5% Pd/c varied from 0.01% to 6% at corresponding pressures of 179 kg/cm2 and 50 kg/cm2 respectively, whereas the concentration of Pt02 used at atmospheric pressure was as high as 30-75%.<br>
In case of noble metal catalysts, the basic cost of catalysts is quite high. Further they are once used only and need recovery of the metal every time for repreparation of the catalyst for reuse. This involve cost due to Ipsses, equipment, use of chemicals and labour etc. for repreparation. The pressures required are quite high e.g. 179 kg/cm2 at minimum of 0.01% catalyst concentration and 50 kg/cm2 at a concentration of as high as 6% of 5% Pd/c. Thus the overall pressures required are quite high and catalysts being cost prohibitive even after recovery and reuse.<br><br>
Base metal catalysts<br>
To reduce the cost of production, base metal catalysts such as Nickel supported on Si/Al etc. or unsupported like Raney Nickel have also been used with or without the use of solvents. I.W. Humphery (Hercules power co. ) U.S.Pat 2,113,808 (1938) reported the use of base metal catalyst such as Ni at 2000-15000 Psi at 125 -225°C.But it affected only 50% saturation of unsaturated bonds. Rolling J.B. (Herecules Power co) U.S. Pat 2, 155,036, April 1939, used Ni-si alloy as catalyst, but the pressure required was again high 2500-5000 Psi at 18 0-22 0°C. J.C. Funderbuck, U.S.Pat. 2,739,947, March 1956 incorporated Mn&amp;C in the Ni-Si alloy catalyst to improve its strength, but the pressure required for hydrogenation was 5000 Psi at 525°;R.J. Byrket (Hercules power Co.) U.S. Pat. 2,094,117,Sept.28,1937 used Ni-Al alloy.as catalyst for hydrogenating Methyl or Glyceryl abietate at super atmospheric pressure and high temperature. Polish Pat. 46,722 of 1966 reported the use of Raney Nickel type of catalyst prepared from Nickel formate, but the most favourable conditions reported for hydrogenation are 210-300°C at 250 kg/cm2- with a catalyst concentration of 0.25% Nickel. They recovered the catalyst for reuse by sedimentation at 18 0°C for several hours, but the pressure required for hydrogenation was very high.<br><br>
It is thus clear that even in case of base metal catalysts, whether in the form of supported and shaped catalysts or in the form of Raney Nickel, with or without the use of solvents, the pressure required for hydrogenation is around 200 kg/cm2, which is quite high. This warrants the use of high pressure specialised equipment which is not made in India and has to be imported involving high initial cost. Secondly it require highly trained personnel for its operation and maintenance. Even the hydrogen gas used in all the processes reported is pure having more than 99.95% purity and-'expensive. All this make the process expensive.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the manufacture of hydrogenated rosin and its esters, without the use of any solvent, using cheap, easily preparable Raney Nickel type catalyst which could be recycled as such a number of times without repreparation.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to reduce the reaction pressure to a minimum so that the reactor of commercial size could be made in India.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to use a mixture of hydrogen and an inert gas like nitrogen available commercially from an ammonia cracker at a much cheaper rate than pure hydrogen or anyother such combination.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to recover the catalyst through sedimentation centrifuge immediately after the reaction is over so as to produce product of lighter colour instead of allowing it to settle for several hours as is done conventionally.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the manufacture of hydrogenated rosin and its esters which comprises: reacting rosin/rosin ester with a mixture of hydrogen and an inert gas, in presence of a catalyst such as herein described, at a concentration in the range of 0.1 to 10.0%, under a pressure in the range of 10 to 160 kg/cm2, at a temperature in the range of 120 to 300°C, for a period in the range of 1 to 12 hrs, separating the catalyst and recovering the products by conventional method, the said process is characterized in reacting rosin/rosin ester with mixture of hydrogen and inert gas in presence of catalyst, preferably nickel catalyst at a pressure ranging 10-160 kg/cm2.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention an inert gas used may be such as N2, Ar, He, Kr. And the ratio of H2 and inert gas used may be in the range of 1 : 0 to 1: 2.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the catalyst used may be such as nickel obtained by thermal decomposition of nickel formate or a combination of nickel and copper obtained by thermal decomposition of their organic salts. After the reaction the catalyst may be separated by filtration , sedimentation or through    sedimentation   centrifuge.     The    catalyst    thus     recovered     can<br><br>
be recycled as such a number of times before it looses its activity. It can then be converted back to nickel formate by usual<br>
method.<br>
The extent of hydrogenation depends upon the time duration (1 to 12 hours) given for the reaction. The product obtained is lighter in colour when the catalyst is recovered for recycling through sedimentation centrifuge. The catalyst on loosing its activity after recycling a number of times (15 to 20) , can be converted back to form Nickel formate for reuse.<br>
The invention is described further with reference to the examples given below. These examples should not be construed as to restrict the scope of the invention.<br>
Advantages of the process:<br>
The present invention uses low cost, easily preparable, base metal catalyst such as Raney Nickel. In this the reaction pressure has been brought down to only a fraction of that reported in litrature.lt does not involve the use of any solvent. Further it makes use of a mixture of hydrogen and an innert gas such as nitrogen available from a cheap source like ammonia cracker, instead of pure hydrogen which is costly. With these the total plant cost goes down and a plant having capacity of even one tonne/batch can be made in India. The catalyst is recovered through<br><br>
sedimentation centrifuge, giving a product lighter in colour, compared to recovery through settling for long hours, which is energy and time consuming. The catalyst thus recovered can be recycled a number of times,(15 to 20) till it looses its activity. It is then reconverted for preparation of fresh catalyst. The process can produce hydrogenated and highly hydrogenated products by varying reaction time only. The process is equally good for hydrogenating esters of rosin.<br>
