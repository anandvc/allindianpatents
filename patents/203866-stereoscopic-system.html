				<td>STEREOSCOPIC SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to stereoscopic systems for demonstrating stereoscopic images which enable viewing of the stereoscopic effect without viewing glasses.<br>
The invention is preferably applicable in stereoscopic motion pictures, stereoscopic television and computers.<br>
The invention is also useful for demonstration of stereoscopic information at exhibitions, in museums, concert and sport centers, stadiums and athletic fields, in video advertisements, cars, game and training systems, etc.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Systems which form stereoscopic images for separately viewing, through polarized or shutter viewing glasses, the left and right stereo pair pictures by the left and right eye of a spectator, respectively, are widely knov/n (see book by Valyus N.A entitled "Stereoscopy: Photography, Cinematography, Television".- Moscow, Iskusstvo Publishers, 1986, 263 pages, il,).<br>
Owing to use of the polarized or shutter stereoscopic viewing glasses, the eyes of spectators perceive equal light load, and a great number of spectators can simultaneously observe a full-colored stereoscopic image within a wide angle of vision.<br>
The main problem with the polarization method is the necessity to use a great light flux for film projection on a large screen because up to 70% of the light flux is absorbed by polarization light filters.<br>
The basic disadvantage of the shutter method is that it causes tiredness of the eyes due to low-frequency flickering of images, which may lead to irritation and even disease of eyes when stereoscopic images are being viewed for a long time. To make the flickering imperceptible, up to 83 frames must change every second.<br><br>
2<br>
Generally, in the systems using viewing glasses a viewer experiences discomfort when viewing stereoscopic images through stereoscopic glasses, this resulting in various unfavorable physiological effects, irritation and tiredness of vision.<br>
Simultaneous continuous optical correction (of optical parameters) of each stereoscopic image or simultaneous separate demonstration of different stereoscopic images to several spectators is infeasible. The reason is that a common stereopair image is formed on a general stereoscopic screen so that to be viewed by all of the spectators at the same time,<br>
Widely known are stereoscopic projection systems with high-aperture lenticular stereoscopic screens, in which no viewing glasses are used. The systems comprise a stereo-projector for projecting the combined left and right picture of the stereopair at different angles onto a stereoscreen. A lenticular raster provides an automatic stereoscopic presentation of the image on the stereoscreen (as an auto-stereogram which is registered in the screen plane and consists from vertical parallel or radial strips). The lenticular raster is mounted in front of the auto-stereogram for viewing stereoscopic images.<br>
The images on the screen are focused by the lenticular raster to a viewing room at regions of selectively viewing the left and right images by the left and right eyes of spectators, respectively.<br>
The lenticular raster stereoscopy provides the best quality of the viewed stereoscopic image, while observation of stereoscopic images without viewing glasses is more comfortable for eyes than through viewing glasses. The stereoscopic images are formed on the plane of a video monitor or a stereoscreen as a stereogram (stereopair) consisting of two parallax-mated left and right images (pictures of the same object) in the form of two central projections with descent centers, separated by a lateral baseline. In the stereoscopic projection systems the left and right stereopair pictures are projected by two projectors   at   different   angles   (in   the   horizontal   plane)   of  axes   of<br><br>
3<br>
projection onto an external visualization lenticular raster screen of a translucent (rear-projection) or reflecting (front-projection) type. The projected left and right pictures of the stereopair image are registered in the screen plane as an auto-stereogram with the aid of the lenticular raster formed by vertical cylinder lenses (with parallel or radially-convergent • long axes). Auto-stereograms (parallax stereograms) represent a registered stereogram in which the right and left registered images of the stereopair are split up into narrow vertical strips. These strips are interlaced so that to alternate in succession. The number of lenses on the screen raster must be the same as the number of strip pairs. The right stereopair strips (of the left picture) are projected by lenses to the spectator's left eye (to view the left image), while the left strips (of the right picture) are projected by the same lenses to the right eye (to view the right image).<br>
Problems with such lenticular raster stereoscopic systems include low optical efficiency of the lenticular raster and nonuniform brightness of viewed images when the viewer's eyes shift from the centers of stereo aspects of the viewed stereoscopic image. The viewer experiences discomfort caused by tiresome motionless holding of the head in selective vision areas, while the stereoscopic image appears to be far from ideal. This is explained by the fact that a width of each vision area must be smaller than the size of the eyes basis (distance between eye pupils), while a two or more centimeter displacement of eyes relative to the centers of these areas causes essential reduction in brightness of the image viewed. If the viewer changes position or leaves these areas, the stereoscopic effect is lost. The strict fixation of the viewer's position relative to the vision areas even for several minutes causes discomfort: uneasiness, fast tiredness, because the fviewer is compelled to sit motionless and continuously seek the best visual aspect (center of the vision area) for clear vision of the stereoscopic effect.<br><br>
4<br>
Known are stereoscopic systems for producing multi-aspect raster image in the form of aspectgrams comprising a mosaic of unit elements of stereopair images which differ both in horizontal and vertical parallax, corresponding to successive points of vision at the object along the common base line. Every unit image of the aspectgram is produced by central projection from a discrete set of projection centers located in the plane in front of the lens.<br>
The presence of multiple stereopairs provides more comfortable viewing of the stereoscopic image with the aid of lenticular rasters, and ability of viewing the raster stereoscopic images from different positions of appropriate vision aspects at lateral displacement of spectators. The screen of an unharmonic type (with spherical lenses) provides the possibility of comfortable viewing of the aspectgram image from any aspects (vision points at displacement and free lateral motion of spectators within the vision sector) and when the spectator approaches the stereoscopic image. The screen further exhibits the increased optical power as compared with the raster screens having a linear structure of lens arrangement.<br>
The basic disadvantage of aspectgrams at shooting and replication of films is the necessity of recording redundant information (for shooting and reproducing stereoscopic images with plurality of stereo aspects) on a carrier (photographic film, reproduction). This results in technical and economical problems encountered in recording, replication and viewing of high quality and high resolution multiple-aspect images free of geometric errors.<br>
Main drawback of all conventional stereoscopic screens with a lenticular raster is the impossibility of demonstrating the stereoscopic images within a wide field of view since the screen cannot be made sufficiently wide and/or with a curved surface, while the useful selective vision area is extremely small. For spectators sitting near the end of the screen, the depth of stereoscopic images is distorted from the proximal end towards the distal end of the  screen.  Restriction  of<br><br>
5<br>
the-space of stereoscopic effect clear vision to a .small number (up to 10) of predetermined aspects (narrow vision areas) gives rise to vision discomfort.<br>
In all of the conventional stereoscopic systems, either with or without viewing glasses, only a small number of spectators located just in the center of the viewing room can see the high definition central projection free of geometrical error at maximum resolution and wide field of view. This is dictated by formation of a single common stereo pair image or a multiple-aspect image of one object on a common stereoscreen. Therefore, it is impossible to provide correction of optical distortions in stereoscopic images and optimal dynamic registration of selective vision areas of the stereoscopic images individually for every spectator, as well as to provide simultaneous collective observation of motion pictures or video programs with different contents on a common screen.<br>
Known in the art are projection stereoscopic systems with a lenticular screen in the form of a single large lens. The stereoscopic systems comprise one or more stereo-projectors for simultaneously projecting several stereopair images from different projection aspects and viewing every projection by a given spectator at the same time. Having passed through the lenticular stereoscreen, the rays are focused and collected into convergent beams which draw images of output pupils of all projection lenses in space in front of the stereoscreen (in vision areas of stereoscopic images). Spectators may view the stereoscopic images from different stereo aspects at the same time.<br>
The merits of this system include simple design of the stereoscreen and optimal brightness of the viewed stereopair images when spectator displaces relative to the centers of stereoscopic vision aspects.<br>
A problem with this system is the reduction in the angle of view in proportion to the inclination of the projection axis to the plane of<br><br>
6<br>
stereoscreen, and geometrical error in the stereoscopic picture when it is viewed at an angle to the central optical axis of the stereoscreen lens.<br>
Most closely approaching the present invention by the achieved technical result is a stereoscopic system with a mirror spherical projection stereoscreen in the form of large concave spherical or parabolic mirror, The stereoscopic system comprises one or more stereo-projectors for simultaneously projecting several stereopair images from different projection aspects and simultaneously viewing each projection by a given spectator. Different stereo-projectors may simultaneously project the same or different stereoscopic images. The beams reflected from the mirror-spherical stereoscreen are focused and collected to convergent beams which draw images of output pupils of ail projection lenses in space in front of the stereoscreen (in vision areas of stereoscopic images). Images of the lens pupils for projecting the left images must be located in points in space where the left eyes of spectators are located, while images of the lens pupils for projecting the right images must be located, respectively, in points in space where the right eyes are located. To make the stereo-projector design simpler, the beam of rays at the output of each projection lens is split into several beams by light-splitting systems. Every separate beam of rays will draw, on the mirror-spherical stereoscreen, the complete image of its part of the stereogram, while the projection center of the beam will be shifted relative to the projection center of the other beams. In front of the screen in the auditorium region every beam will be collected separately from the other beams, i.e. it will be focused by the screen on a separate area for viewing one, left or right, image of the stereopair by a given spectator. The light-splitting systems may be semi-transparent mirrors, multiplying prisms and other optical systems. A number of split stereo-projection pairs should be equal to the number of stereoscopic image vision aspects viewed by the respective number of spectators.<br><br>
7<br>
The benefit of the stereoscopic projections through a lenticular screen or on a concave mirror is that they reduce visual fatigue caused by the fact that such stereoscopic projections adjust the spectator's accommodation efforts and eye convergence state (convergence of eye axes). The stereoscopic screens exhibit maximum optical power and provide optimal optical parameters of the viewed stereoscopic images with ability of optical correction of optical parameters of each stereopair image.<br>
A basic problem with the mirror spherical stereoscreen is the strict fixation of the spectator's position relative to the vision areas, which results in discomfort and fast tiredness even after few minutes since every spectator must be sitting motionless and constantly seeking the best aspect (center of the vision area) so that to clearly see the stereoscopic effect.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a .stereoscopic system for comfortably viewing, without viewing glasses, a stereoscopic image on conventional, wide-format and panoramic visualization screens, which allows the stereoscopic effect to be seen from any angle at displacement of spectators.<br>
The main technical result provided by practicing the invention is that a stereo-projection system ensures dynamic optical registration of each predetermined vision area of projection of the left stereopair image with the left'eye of a given spectator, and a vision area of the right stereopair image with the right eye of the spectator. To provide visual comfort for the spectators, such registrations of vision areas are performed by the system continuously, simultaneously and independently for every spectator without regard to free position and displacement of the spectators at any point of the stereoscopic image viewing sector.<br><br>
8<br>
The above technical result is attained in a stereoscopic system for viewing stereogram images without viewing glasses, comprising an apparatus  with  a  visualization  stereoscreen   for  forming   separately localized    screen   images    of   stereopairs.    The   stereoscopic   system comprises, on the stereoscreen, a system for optically separating the left    or    right    screen    image    of    each    predetermined    stereopair, respectively, to a single stereo aspect   for viewing by the left or right eye, respectively, of one given spectator. The combination of technical features which distinguish the claimed system from the most pertinent prior   art   comprises   the   apparatus  for   forming   stereoscopic   images made    as    a    stereo-projection    system    with    a    lenticular    raster stereoscreen, or a cat's-eye screen, or a concave spherical or parabolic stereoscreen.   The  projection   system  comprises  a   number  of stereo-projectors equal to a number of spectators so that to form a number of stereopairs  equal  to  the  number  of spectators.   Projection  lenses  of each ste.reo-projector are adapted to be displaced in parallel with the stereoscreen. The lenses are located in space so that the screen image of  one   stereopair   projected   by   lenses   of  each   stereo-projector   is focused by the stereoscreen to an aspect for viewing the stereoscopic image by one predetermined  spectator.  The  stereo-projection system comprises an automatic corrector with actuators which are connected separately to each pair of projection lenses of the stereo-projectors for separately displacing the lenses in parallel with the stereoscreen in the direction of registration of one predetermined stereo aspect with respective eyes of a predetermined spectator   To this end, the system comprises    a    sensor    for    separate    determination    of   the    location coordinates of the eyes of each spectator relative to the stereo aspect for viewing the stereopair screen image by this spectator. The sensor is   connected   to   the   automatic   corrector   and   adapted   to   generate control signals which are provided to the automatic corrector.<br>
The    stereoscopic    system     according    to    the     present invention  is  characterized   by  a  design  of the  lenticular  raster<br><br>
9<br>
stereoscreen. The screen is a translucent screen with three parallel layers of lenticular rasters, each raster layer being formed by spherical lenses. AH lenses in the raster layers are located so that every three positive lenses, one from each raster layer, are on a common optical axis, as in the structure of a straight-drawing lens with the linear magnification ratio equal to unity. All output pupils of pairs of the projection lenses are set for through-projection behind the stereoscreen in a common plane which is parallel to the plane of stereoscreen and spaced from the screen so that to provide sharp focusing by the stereoscreen of every stereopair screen image to points of stereo aspects for clearly viewing the stereoscopic effect by every spectator. The spectator's eyes must be also located in the plane of these stereo aspects, that is at a distance from the screen equal to the distance from the screen to the plane of output pupils of pairs of projection lenses. For magnifying the projection of a single stereoscopic image (viewed by a given spectator) on the stereoscreen, each pair of the projection lenses is connected to a separate actuator for separate automatic correction of these pair of lenses independently, from the other pairs of the lenses. To provide simultaneous viewing of different stereoscopic images, the projection system may comprise two or more separate stereo-projectors for simultaneous parallel projecting of different full-screen stereoscopic images on the common stereoscreen.<br>
This embodiment of the stereoscopic system provides the possibility of simultaneous comfortable viewing (without stereo glasses) of different stereoscopic images on a common visualization screen by different spectators from corresponding vision areas. A number of spectators (at any position or displacement of the spectators within the sector of stereoscopic image projection) may amount to more than thousand people, The lenticular raster screen, providing central projection by each pair of stereo-projectors (every projection  axis  is  directed   perpendicular  to  the   stereoscreen   plane).<br><br>
10<br>
allows the stereoscopic images to be viewed within a wide angle of view up to 90° with the same optical parameters, to ensure visual comfort to all spectators irrespective of their position in the vision sector.<br>
The stereoscopic system according to the present invention is further characterized  in that the stereoscreen is a mirror lenticular raster<br>
screen   of   cat's-eye   type   comprised   of   cat's-eyes   in   the   form   of spherical   microlenses   having   a  mirror  coating   at   the   rear   side.   In another   embodiment,   the   cat's-eye   stereoscreen   comprises   a   raster made    by    corner    mirror    reflectors.    In    any    embodiment    of   the stereoscopic   system   with   a   cat's-eye   stereoscreen,   every   pair   of projection lenses (for magnifying projections on the  stereoscreen) is located closer to the head of a predetermined spectator. These lenses are directed at the stereoscreen for reflecting, by the stereoscreen, the right  stereopair image projected by the lens at the right  side of the head to the right eye of this spectator, and the left stereopair image projected by the lens at the left side of the head to the left eye of the spectator. For simultaneously viewing different stereoscopic images on the common screen by a great number of spectators,  each individual pair    of   projection    lenses    is    similarly    arranged    relative    to    the stereoscreen and the head of its spectator.<br>
This    embodiment    of   the    stereoscopic    system    provides    the possibility    of   simultaneous    comfortable    viewing    (without    stereo glasses)   of  different   stereoscopic   images   on   a   common   screen   by different spectators from respective vision areas at different distances from the  stereoscreen.  A number  of spectators (at  any  position  and displacement of the spectators within the sector of projection of these stereoscopic images) may also amount to more than thousand people. Stereoscopic    screens    with    cat's-eye    microlenses    may    allow    the observation of stereoscopic  images within vnde  and  even  panoramic angles   of view  up  to   90°.   The   automatic   corrector   for  registering selective  vision  areas   of the   left   and   right   stereopair   images   with<br><br>
11<br>
respective eyes of the spectators may provide comfortable viewing of the stereoscopic effect at any displacement of the spectator's head (back and forth, leftward and rightward, up and down) within the vision sector of stereoscopic images, the lens pairs being appropriately displaced through the automatic correction.<br>
The stereoscopic system according to the present invention is further characterized in that the stereoscreen for reflecting a projection is a<br>
spherical  or  parabolic  concave  mirror  with  the  center  of radius  of<br>
curvature located at the side of a spectator. Each given projection lens<br>
is continuously shifted by the automatic corrector to a point in space<br>
which symmetrical to the respective eye of the spectator. The axis of<br>
this symmetry is the radius of curvature of the screen mirror. In this<br>
event, the output pupil of the lens, the spectator's eye and the axis of<br>
symmetry along the radius of curvature of the mirror are in the same<br>
plane of symmetry.<br>
This  embodiment  of the stereoscopic  system  provides  a  simple<br>
design of the stereoscreen and absence of light flares on the screen at<br>
any spurious illumination of the stereoscreen beyond the output pupil<br>
of    any    projection    lens.    Therefore,    the    system    is    useful    for<br>
demonstration    of   stereoscopic    images    at    any    external    spurious<br>
illumination of the stereoscreen.<br>
The   stereoscopic   system   according   to   the   present<br>
invention is also characterized in that the stereo-projector comprises a pair of stationary projection telelenses (one telelens for projecting the left image, and the other for projecting the right image) with a light-splitting system made by mirror or prism elements. The light-splitting system is arranged after the telelenses for splitting beams projected from output pupils of these telelenses and directing the beams to input pupils of wide-angle or normal mobile projection lenses for magnifying and shifting stereopair projections on the stereoscreen. The light-splitting elements and the mobile projection lenses for magnifying the images on the  screen  are connected  to  an<br><br>
12<br>
actuator of the automatic corrector for separately displacing the lenses in parallel with the plane of the stereoscreen so that to register predetermined stereo aspects with the eyes of respective spectators.<br>
This embodiment of the stereoscopic system provides a simple design of the stereo-projection system for forming a plurality of stereopairs viewed simultaneously by a plurality of spectators at a common stereoscreen. This simplification is provided owing to the replacement of a plurality of sophisticated stereo-projectors by the simpler system of projection lenses with a light-splitting system and automatic correction actuators.<br>
The stereoscopic system according to the present invention is further     characterized in that the apparatus for generating stereoscopic images<br>
is a monitor with a lenticular raster stereoscreen for forming several auto-stereograms  of stereopair  images.  To  form  a  great  number  of stereopairs  clearly  seen by  a large  number of spectators,  the  raster must be regular and comprise spherical lenses. In one embodiment of the   monitor   with   a   lenticular   raster   stereoscreen,   elements   of  the image   formed   on   a   transmission-type   screen   of   the   monitor   are directionally illuminated.  In another embodiment of the  monitor, the lenticular raster of the stereoscreen comprises single-lens raster cells optically   isolated   from   each   other.   In   both   embodiments   of   the monitor, every light beam from an element of the left screen image of one stereopair is focused on one vision area for the left eye of a given spectator, while an element of the right image of the same stereopair is focused,  respectively,  on the vision area for the right  eye  of the same  spectator.   Another  stereopair is similarly focused  by lenses  of another  raster for viewing by  another  spectator  from  another  stereo aspect.     To     provide     simultaneous,     continuous,     automatic     and independent   registration   of  each   raster   with   the   screen   stereopair image   focused   by   this   raster,,   the   monitor   is   provided   with   an automatic    corrector    for    displacing    images    of    the    stereogram stereopairs   relative   to   the   raster   lenses.   To   this   end,   the   system<br><br>
13<br>
comprises   a   sensor  for   separately   determining   the   spatial   location<br>
coordinates of the eyes of each spectator. The sensor in connected to<br>
the automatic corrector and adapted to generate control signals which<br>
are   provided   to   the   automatic   corrector   for   simultaneously   and<br>
separately  shifting these  elements  of auto-stereogram  images  on  the<br>
stereoscreen   in   parallel   with   the   lenticular   raster   so   that   each<br>
stereoscopic   raster   of  the   viewed   stereoscopic   image   be   optically<br>
registered by the lenticular raster with the eyes of a given spectator at<br>
his displacement.<br>
This   embodiment    of   the    stereoscopic    system    provides    the<br>
continuously clear vision of the stereoscopic effect by every spectator<br>
and maximum optical power of lenticular  raster  screen.  There is no<br>
optical interference for spectators at the automatic correction (mutual<br>
displacement on the screen of different screen stereopair images) for<br>
registering  stereo   aspects   of different   stereo pairs  with  the  eyes  of<br>
appropriate spectators. Every spectator can see, on the common screen<br>
of   the   monitor,   a   full-screen   stereoscopic   image   with   individual<br>
contents,   while   the   other    spectators   are    simultaneously    viewing<br>
another stereo images.<br>
The stereoscopic system according to the present invention comprises<br>
an apparatus with a visualization stereoscreen, In one embodiment of the system, the apparatus for forming stereoscopic images is a monitor with a lenticular raster screen. In another embodiment, the system is a stereo-projection system with a lenticular raster stereoscreen. In both embodiments,   the system   is   adapted to   form   images   of   one   or simultaneously    several    stereopair s    (located    separately    like    auto-stereogram   stereopairs   in. the   form   of a   parallaxgram),   the   images being fixed on the stereoscreen. The lenticular raster is movable along the stereoscreen plane for automatically registering the stereo aspect with the spectator's eyes with the aid of the automatic corrector.   In the case of several spectators, a number of stereopairs formed on the screen is equal to the number of spectators.  A respective number  of<br><br>
14<br>
movable  lenticular   rasters  is   arranged   on   the   stereoscreen,   Every lenticular raster focuses, to a predetermined stereo aspect, only one image of the stereopair for viewing it by one given spectator. To this end, the raster may be made and located on the stereoscreen similarly to the design of the stereoscreen as set forth in claim 6. To register the rasters with the screen stereopair images of suto-stereograms, the system  comprises  an  automatic  corrector.   The   automatic  corrector comprises actuators connected to each separate lenticular raster. The system   comprises   a   sensor   for   separately   determining   the   spatial location coordinates of each eye of every  spectator.  The  sensor is connected to the automatic corrector and adapted to generate control signals    which    are    provided    to    the    automatic    corrector    for simultaneously shifting each such raster along the screen (relative to the screen stereopair images projected by this raster so that each stereo aspect be optically registered with the eyes of the respective spectator).<br>
This system provides constant clear viewing of the stereoscopic effect by every spectator, and maximum optical power of the lenticular raster stereoscreen. There is no optical interference for the spectators at automatic correction (mutual displacement of lenticular rasters on the stereoscreen) for registration of stereo aspects of different stereopairs with the eyes of respective spectators. Every spectator can see, on the common screen of the monitor, a full-screen stereoscopic image with individual contents, while the other spectators are viewing different stereoscopic images.<br>
The stereoscopic system according to the present invention, further comprises an apparatus with a visualization screen. The system is characterized in that the apparatus for forming stereoscopic images is a stereo-projection system for forming auto-stereogram images with a lenticular raster stereoscreen and a number of stereo-projectors equal to a number of spectators. Projection lenses of each stereo-projector are located in space so that a screen image of one stereopair projected by<br><br>
15<br>
lenses  of each  stereo-projector  is  focused  by  the  stereoscreen  to   a stereo   aspect   to   be   viewed   by   one   given   spectators.   In   another embodiment,   the   apparatus   for   forming   stereoscopic   images   is   a monitor   with   a   lenticular   raster   stereoscreen   for   forming   auto-stereogram   images  with   a   number   of stereopair  images   equal   to   a number of spectators. In both embodiments of the stereoscopic system, chairs   for   spectators   are   mounted   in   the   sector     for   viewing   the stereoscopic   image,   each   chair   being   movable   within   the   area   of spectator's displacements and registration of the spectators' eyes with one predetermined stereo aspect.  The system comprises an automatic corrector with  actuators  connected  to  each  chair  for  independently displacing every chair with the  spectator to  the position  of optimal viewing by the  spectator  of the  stereoscopic  effect  (to  the  area  of registration of the  stereo  aspect with the  eyes  of a  spectator).   The system   comprises   a   sensor   for   separately   determining   the   spatial location coordinates  of each  eye  of every   spectator.   The  sensor  is connected to the automatic corrector and adapted to generate control signals which are provided to the automatic corrector.<br>
The system provides the possibility of automatic correction at spectator's displacement in the chair in any direction; up and down, leftward and rightward, back and forth, which is more comfortable for viewing wide-screen and panoramic stereoscopic images because stereo aspects can be accurately registered with the eyes of spectators in any direction.<br>
The stereoscopic system according to the present invention is also characterized in that m embodiments with the projection systems for forming stereoscopic images, the projection lenses for magnifying images on the stereoscreen comprise individual correcting optical elements such as curved mirrors or lenses for correcting geometric errors, and/or halftone, and/or color light filters for adjusting the brightness or chroma over the field of image. In accordance with claim 8, the stereoscopic<br><br>
16<br>
system as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 4 is characterized in that each pair of the projection magnifying lenses (for forming projections of the left and right stereopair images for one or more spectators) comprises    individual    correction    optical    elements.    The    optical correction elements, such as prisms, cylinder or spherical lenses, are designed  for  transformation  of images,  and/or  correction  of linear magnification   of images,   elimination  of geometrical   errors,   and/or adjusting   angles   of view,   while   gray   or   color   optical   filters   are provided for adjusting the brightness  or chroma over the  field  of image.   The   projection   lenses   are   focused   with   equal   angles   of magnification so that all spectators can see screen stereoscopic images at   different   distances   with   equal   definition   (the   same   resolution viewed) and at the same angles of view.<br>
The stereoscopic system ensures complete elimination of geometrical errors, chromatic and brightness aberrations of viewed stereoscopic images for every spectator irrespective of points of projection and viewing.<br>
The stereoscopic system according to the present<br>
invention is further characterized by the stereo - projection<br>
system being	adapted to separately project a screen<br>
stereoscopic image in the form of combined left and right pictures of the stereopair only in the central part of the stereoscreen. The projection system simultaneously projects monoscopic images of the left part of the left picture of the stereopair to the left part of the screen, and the right part of the right picture of this stereopair to the right part of the screen.<br>
The stereoscopic system ensures the expanded angle of view of the stereoscopic effect owing to the ability of peripheral vision to perceive greater stereoscopy of the stereoscopic image in the screen center at a greater angle of view, while seeing monoscopic images on the left and right parts of the screen.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
Referring to Fig.l, a stereoscopic system comprises two separate stereo-projectors   1(1)   and   1(2)   with   a   projection   telelens   11   (to project the  left  image  of a  stereopair)  and   Ir  (to  project  the  right image    of   the    stereopair).    The    system    comprises    a    translucent visualization stereoscreen 2 for simultaneously forming a plurality of magnified screen images of stereopairs and focusing light fluxes of the screen images to corresponding stereo aspects (vision areas 31, 3r of the left image for the left eye, and the right image for the right eye, respectively) for every given  spectator.  The  stereo-projector  optical system is made by optical  elements  (not  shown),  such as mirrors or optical prisms,  for separating, distributing and  shifting  in  space the light fluxes of stereo-projection from the telelens  11 and  Ir to  input pupils   of  magnifying   projection   lenses   41   (for   magnifying   the   left stereopair  image  on  the  stereoscreen  2)  and  4r  (for  magnifying  the<br><br>
18<br>
right stereopair image). The stereoscreen i;; arranged in parallel with the spatial plane in which all eyes 3r and 31 of the spectators are located and the plane in which the projection lenses 41 and 4r are located. Each of the projection telelenses 11 or Ir is a long-focus lens for projecting through a light-splitting system in direction (a) with the image magnification scale within the area of input aperture of a corresponding projection short-focus (normal or wide-angle) lens 41 or 4r. The lenses 41 or 4r are disposed at different points of projection (separate projection aspects) at the rear side of the stereoscreen for projecting these images in direction (b) with large magnification onto the stereoscreen 2. Lenticular rasters of the stereoscreen 2 are optically oriented for focusing the images projected on the stereoscreen in direction (c) of location of corresponding selective vision areas for viewing the left and right stereopair images by the left and right eye 31 and 3r, respectively. The system comprises an automatic corrector 5 with individual actuators connected to each of the projection lenses 4! or 4r. The automatic corrector system comprises a common sensor 6 or a plurality of separate sensors 6 connected to the automatic corrector 5 for determining, from optical signals (d), the spatial location coordinates of corresponding eyes of the spectators, and subsequently generating control signals for automatic correction in direction (g) of the location coordinates of projection lenses 41 and 4r taking into account dynamic registration of each vision area of the left stereopair images with the left eyes 31 and of the right stereopair image with the right eyes 3r of every spectator. This will enable the permanent viewing of clear stereoscopic effect at displacement of spectators.<br>
Fig.2 shows a fragment (including three lenses in each layer of the stereoscreen) of optical diagram of the translucent lenticular raster stereoscreen 2 of unharmonic type. The screen is made by three layers of lenticular rasters comprising spherical microlenses. Every three lenses   7,   8   and   9,   disposed   in   different   raster   layers,   are   optically<br><br>
19<br>
arranged on a common optical axis in accordance with the optical design of a straight-drawing microlens with the linear magnification ratio equal to unity. Distance Al from the center of the stereoscreen 2 to the plane in which output lenses of every projection lens 41 or 4r are located, is equal to distance A2 from the center of the stereoscreen to the, plane in which the centers of stereoscopic image vision areas 31 and 3r (optimum position of the spectators' eyes) are located.<br>
Referring to Fig.3, a stereoscopic system comprises a stereo-projector oriented" to project, on a stereoscreen 10 (a projection system or a monitor) by the lens (Ir) of the right stereopair image, and the lens (U) of the left stereopair image. In this system, the transparent lenticular raster stereoscreen has the central optical plane 10 for forming an auto-stereogram image, and two rasters disposed at the rear and front side of the screen. A raster 11 (at the rear side) serves to form, on the plane 10, images 11 and 1r of the stereopair (stereogram) projected by lenses 11 and Ir to auto-stereogram (with unit images in the form of line;i or dots). A front raster 13 is adapted to move in parallel with the plane 10, optically mated with the screen image of auto-stereogram and connected to an actuator of the automatic corrector 5. The automatic corrector is connected to the sensor 6 for determining the spatial location coordinates of the spectators' eyes and generating control signals provided to the automatic corrector for dynamically mating the raster 13 with the auto-stereogram and providing constant viewing of the stereoscopic image with clear stereoscopic effect at spectators' displacement.<br>
Fig.4 shows a stereo-projector 1 with projection telelenses 11 and Ir for projecting the left and right stereopair images, respectively, in directions (a) to appropriate input apertures of projection lenses 41 and 4r. A light-splitting system may be mounted between the lenses 11 and 41 and the lenses Ir and 4r, Every one separate pair of lenses 41 and 4r is made in the form of normal or wide-angle lens systems and<br><br>
20<br>
disposed closer to the head of a given spectator so that the lens 4r (for projecting the right stereopair image) is disposed at the right side of the head closer to the right eye 31, while the lens 41 is disposed at the left side of the head closer to the left eye 31. The lenses 41 and 4r are oriented at the lenticular raster reflecting stereoscreen 13 for projecting in direction (b) with magnification of the stereopair images. The stereoscreen 13 comprises, at the side of spectators, beads of cat's-eye microsphere lenses 14 having a mirror coating 15 at the rear side. Every lens 14 has a rated radius of the lens sphere, radius of the mirror coating 15, and is oriented to the stereoscreen for focusing stereopair images which are projected to the stereoscreen in direction (b) by lenses 41 and 4r (the images being reflected by lens mirrors in direction (e) on vision areas of the left stereopair image for the left eye 31 of a spectator, and the right stereopair image for the right eye 3r). The automatic correction system of all projection lenses for dynamic separate simultaneous registration of the vision areas with the eyes of spectators at displacement of these spectators is similar to the system disclosed in connection with Fig.l.<br>
Fig.5 shows a stereoscopiic system comprising a stereo-projector 1 with projection telelenses 11 (for projecting the left stereopair image) and 11 (for projecting the right stereopair image), a light splitting system (not shown), and magnifying normal and wide-angle projection lenses 41 (for projecting the left stereopair image) and 4r (for projecting the right stereopair image). A reflecting mirror spherical stereoscreen 16 comprises a concave spherical mirror 15 (at the side of projection and viewing of stereoscopic image) having the inner radius of curvature R and the center of curvature OR. Output apertures of each projection lens 41 and 4r are located, with the aid of the automatic corrector 5, at predetermined points of projection (projection aspects) symmetrically to coordinates of the vision area centers of the left screen image for the left eye 31 and the right screen image  for  the  right  eye  3r  of every  given  spectator,  respectively,   the<br><br>
21<br>
axis of symmetry is the axis with center OR of the radius of curvature R of the stereoscreen mirror sphere. The separate dynamic automatic correction system of all projection lenses 4r and 41 for automatically and separately registering the vision areas of screen stereoscopic images with the eyes of spectators at displacement of the spectators is similar to the system described with reference to Fig.l.<br>
Figs 6 and 7 show a planar stereoscopic system which comprises monitors 11 (for forming the left stereopair image) and Ir (for forming the right stereopair image) with two or more projection telelenses 17 and a plurality of wide-angle projection lenses 18 (for magnifying parts of a common stereoscopic image on a translucent lenticular raster stereoscreen 10). The monitors Ir and U form light flux of projection in direction (a) towards telelenses 17 disposed at the end of the stereoscreen and oriented to project in direction (b) without magnification of images along the stereoscreen plane to input apertures of lenses 18. Telelenses 17 project local parts of the general area of the left and right images of one or more stereopairs with the general area for full-screen images formed by video monitors 11 or Ir. The lenses 18 are mated with deflecting mirrors 19, located at different points (projection aspects) in the plane parallel to the stereoscreen 10, and oriented to project the image in direction (c) with magnification of the part of the image area on a predetermined localized portion 20 of the area of the translucent stereoscreen 10 The stereoscreen 10 comprises a two-side lenticular raster for forming auto-stereogram stereoscopic images. One or more lenticular rasters are mutually movable in line (g) along the stereoscreen plane, and separately connected to actuators of the automatic corrector 5 The sensor 6 is connected with the automatic corrector 6 and receives signals (d) of the spatial location coordinates of the spectators' eyes The automatic corrector automatically dynamically registers the stereoscopic image vision areas with the spectators', eyes at displacement of the spectators.<br><br>
22<br>
A   Stereo   projection    system   in   accordance   with   the   present invention operates in the following manner.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, the projectors 1(1) and 1(2) project, by all pairs of lenses II and Ir with the light-splitting system with lenses 41 and 4r from different aspects, the left and right images of stereopairs which are parallax-mated on the visualization screen 2 as auto-stereograms, The first layer of the stereoscreen (in Figs 1 and 2) forms, at the side of projectors (with the raster of lenses 7) on the central (second) layer of the stereoscreen (with the raster of lenses 8), images in the form of aspectgrams of all images of output apertures of the projection lenses 41 and 4r, The third layer (with the raster of lenses 9) focuses each image of output apertures of the projection lenses to the aspectgram on corresponding vision areas of these images for respective eyes 31 and 3r of spectators. The sensor 6 or a plurality of separate sensors 6 receive light signals (d) of the spatial location coordinates of every eye of the spectator, and generates automatic correction signals which are provided to the automatic corrector 5. On the basis of these signals, the corrector shifts, by separate actuators, every definite pair of projection lenses 41 and 4r in the direction (g) in parallel to the path of displacement of the eyes of a corresponding spectator, thereby providing independent dynamic registration of each particular vision area with the respective eye of the spectator. The automatic correction ensures constant viewing, by any spectator, of clear stereoscopic effect at any point of location of the spectators' eyes or in the process of lateral displacement of the spectators independently of one another.<br>
The stereo-projection system shown in Fig.3 projects, by the stereo monitor 1 with projection lenses 11 and Ir, the left and right mated images of the stereogram on the lenticular raster 1 1 of the stereoscreen 10 to form on plane 10 of this screen one or more auto-stereograms (by separately projecting with parallax several stereopairs similarly to aspectgram images)   With the aid of separate actuators of<br><br>
23<br>
the automatic corrector 5 with the sensor 6 for monitoring coordinates of spectators' eyes, the front raster 12 or several front independent rasters 12 disposed at the side of spectators are dynamically displaced in direction (g) to registration of each stereopair screen image vision area with the eyes of respective spectators. Therefore, every spectator can constantly view the clear stereoscopic effect from any aspect at displacement of the spectators in the stereoscopic image viewing sector. The stereoscopic system with a similar automatic correction of front rasters may be formed on the stereoscreen (in the plane of the screen 10 without projection and the raster 11 at the rear side of the screen) of a video monitor, a television set, a computer monitor, in the form of stereo photography, stereo illustration, a shop window or an advertisement billboard.<br>
Like the embodiment of the stereoscopic projection system shown in Fig.l, the stereoscopic systems shown in Fig.4 with cat's-eye lenticular raster or mirror spherical stereoscreen shown in Fig.5 also simultaneously project a plurality of stereopair images from different projection points (projection aspects). The independent dynamic automatic correction is provided by similar automatic correctors 5 with sensors 6 (for defining the spatial location coordinates of the spectators' eyes) for registering every predetermined vision area of each stereopair image with respective eyes of a given spectator.<br>
In the stereoscopic system shown in Figs.5 and 6, the monitor 11 forms the left image and the monitor Ir forms the right irnage of a stereopair. Projection telelenses 17, wide-angle lenses 18 and deflecting mirrors 19 project, onto a part 20 of the area of the stereoscreen 10, a part of the area of full-screen images of the stereopair in the form of stereogram screen images. The lenticular raster of the stereoscreen 10 (disposed on the rear side of the stereoscreen) forms full-screen images as an auto-stereogram. By the mobile front raster or several independently moving rasters of the stereoscreen   10  (disposed  at  the  side  of spectators)  with  the  aid  of<br><br>
24<br>
separate actuators of the automatic corrector, the automatic corrector 5 provides dynamic independent registration of vision areas of the left and right full-screen images of the stereopair with the left and right eyes of every spectator, respectively, at displacement of this spectator. The sensors 6 determine spatial location coordinates of the spectators' eyes. The sensors are connected to the automatic corrector and generate control signals which are provided to the automatic corrector.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
All of the stereo-projection systems in accordance with the invention may be produced on the commercial scale using conventional designs and production methods of projection and monitor systems for forming conventional and stereoscopic images. The stereoscreens in accordance with the invention may be fabricated by conventional methods for fabricating the lenticular raster and mirror spherical screens. The claimed automatic correction systems may be fabricated using conventional designs and production methods of similar automatic correction systems used in various fields for automatically tracking the objects. Therefore, the industrial applicability of the present invention is obvious. The stereoscopic systems may find wide application in cinemas and any television and computer systems in which the clear stereoscopic effect must be viewed at any viewing angle and at any mutual displacement of plurality of spectators. Such stereoscopic systems will ensure the most comfortable viewing, without viewing glasses, of stereoscopic images with optimal optical parameters at free positioning and mutual displacement of spectators, at collective simultaneous viewing of the, same or different stereoscopic images on a common, stereoscreen within a wide angle of view.<br><br>
