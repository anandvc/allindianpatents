ALKALINE, POST PLASMA ETCH/ASH RESIDUE REMOVERS<br>
AND PHOTORESIST STRIPPING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING METAL-HALIDE CORROSION INHIBITORS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to compositions useful in the microelectronics<br>
industry for cleaning semiconductor wafer substrates. Particularly, this invention relates to alkaline stripping or cleaning compositions containing metal-halide corrosion inhibitors that are used for cleaning wafers having metal lines and vias by removing post plasma etch and ash residue and metallic and organic contamination with reduced metal corrosion and without any significant damaging of the integrated circuits. The compositions are also suitable for stripping photoresist from the wafer substrates. The invention also relates to the use of the compositions for removing post plasma etch and ash residue and metallic and organic contamination with reduced metal corrosion and without any significant damaging of the integrated circuits and to stripping photoresist from the wafer substrates.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
[0002]	An integral part of microelectronic fabrication is the use of photoresists<br>
to transfer an image from a mask or reticle to the desired circuit layer. After the desired image transfer has been achieved, an etching process is used to form the desired structures. The most common structures formed in this way are metal lines and vias.<br>
[0003]	The metal lines are used to form electrical connections between<br>
various parts of the integrated circuit that lie in the same fabrication layer. The vias are holes that are etched through dielectric layers and later filled with a conductive metal.   These are used to make electrical connections between different vertical<br><br>
layers of the integrated circuit. A halogen containing gas is generally used in the processes used for forming metal lines and vias.<br>
[0004]	After the etching process  has been completed,  the bulk of the<br>
photoresist may be removed by either a chemical stripper solution or by an oxygen plasma ashing process. The problem is that these etching processes produce highly insoluble metal-containing residues that may not be removed by common chemical stripper solutions. Also, during an ashing process the metal-containing residues are oxidized and made even more difficult to remove, particularly in the case of aluminum-based integrated circuits. See, "Managing Etch and Implant Residue," Semiconductor International, August 1997, pages 56-63.<br>
[0005]	An example of such an etching process is the patterning of metal lines<br>
on an integrated circuit. In this process, a photoresist coating is applied over a metal film then imaged through a mask or reticle to selectively expose a pattern in the photoresist coating. The coating is developed to remove either exposed or unexposed photoresist, depending on the tone of the photoresist used, and produce a photoresist pattern on the metal. The remaining photoresist is usually hard-baked at high temperature to remove solvents and optionally to cross-link the polymer matrix. The actual metal etching step is then performed. This etching step removes metal not covered by photoresist through the action of a gaseous plasma. Removal of such metal transfers the pattern from the photoresist layer to the metal layer. The remaining photoresist is then removed ("stripped") with an organic stripper solution or with an oxygen plasma ashing procedure. The ashing procedure is often followed by a rinsing step that uses a liquid organic stripper solution. However, the stripper solutions currently available, usually alkaline stripper solutions, leave insoluble metal oxides and other metal-containing residues on the integrated circuit.<br>
[0006]	Another example of such an etching process is the patterning of vias<br>
(interconnect holes) on an integrated circuit. In this process, a photoresist coating is<br><br>
applied over a dielectric film then imaged through a mask or reticle to selectively expose a pattern in the photoresist coating. The coating is developed to remove either exposed or unexposed photoresist, depending on the tone of the photoresist used, and produce a photoresist pattern on the metal. The remaining photoresist is usually hard-baked at high temperature to remove solvents and optionally to crosslink the polymer matrix. The actual dielectric etching step is then performed. This etching step removes dielectric not covered by photoresist through the action of a gaseous plasma. Removal of such dielectric transfers the pattern from the photoresist layer to the dielectric layer. The remaining photoresist is then removed ("stripped") with an organic stripper solution or with an oxygen plasma ashing procedure. Typically, the dielectric is etched to a point where the underlying metal layer is exposed. A titanium or titanium nitride anti-reflective or diffusion barrier layer is typically present at the metal/dielectric boundary. This boundary layer is usually etched through to expose the underlying metal. It has been found that the action of etching through the titanium or titanium nitride layer causes titanium to be incorporated into the etching residues formed inside of the via. Oxygen plasma ashing oxidizes these via residues making them more difficult to remove.<br>
[0007]	The use of alkaline strippers on microcircuit containing metal films has<br>
not always produced quality circuits, particularly when used with metal films containing aluminum or various combinations or alloys of active metals such as aluminum or titanium with more electropositive metals such as copper or tungsten. Various types of metal corrosion, such as corrosion whiskers, pitting, notching of metal lines, have been observed due, at least in part, to reaction of the metals with alkaline strippers. Further it has been shown, by Lee et a/., Proc. Interface '89, pp. 137-149, that very little corrosive action takes place until the water rinsing step that is required to remove the organic stripper from the wafer. The corrosion is evidently a result of contacting the metals with the strongly alkaline aqueous solution that is present during rinsing. Aluminum metal is known to corrode rapidly under such conditions, Ambat et a/., Corrosion Science, Vol. 33 (5), p. 684.1992.<br><br>
[0008]	Prior  methods   used  to  avoid   this  corrosion   problem   employed<br>
intermediate rinses with non-alkaline organic solvents such as isopropyl alcohol. However, such methods are expensive and have unwanted safety, chemical hygiene, and environmental consequences.<br>
[0009]	The prior art discloses several organic strippers used to remove bulk<br>
photoresist after the etching process. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,765,844, 5,102,777 and 5,308,745 disclose photoresist strippers comprising various combinations of organic solvents. These strippers, however, are not very effective on wafers that have been "ashed" with oxygen plasmas as described above. Some photoresist strippers attempt to address this problem by adding additional water and an organic corrosion inhibitor such as catechol. Such compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,482,566, 5,279,771, 5,381,807, 5,334,332, 5,709,756, 5,707,947, and 5,419,779 and in WO 9800244. In some cases, the hydrazine derivative, hydroxylamine, is added as well. The use of catechol or hydroxylamine in stripping compositions gives rise to various environmental, safety, and health concerns.<br>
[0010]	The use of an aqueous solution containing a quaternary ammonium<br>
hydroxide and a quaternary ammonium salt of silicic acid or alkyl silicate has been used as photoresist developers for positive tone photoresists in disclosures such as JP 1120552 (published May 12, 1989) and US Patent No. 4,628,023. Positive tone photoresist developers are used to remove patterned bulk photoresist after exposure to a solublizing radiation source. Developers are used prior to etching for pattern transfer to the exposed metal or dielectric substrate where metallic residues are generated. The object of the use of a quaternary ammonium salt of silicic acid in this disclosure is to prevent corrosion of metal substrates while removing the soluble bulk organic photoresist and not the removal of metal-rich post etch residues present on metal substrates without causing corrosion.<br><br>
[0011]	in US Patent Nos. 6,599,370; 6,585,825; 6,465,403; 6,020,292; and<br>
5,817,610 and EP 829,768 the use of a quaternary ammonium silicate, quaternary ammonium hydroxide and water is disclosed for use in removing plasma etch residues. In US Patent No. 5,759,973 and EP 828,197 the use of a quaternary ammonium silicate, an amine compound, water and optionally an organic polar solvent is disclosed for use as a stripping and cleaning composition. In WO 9960448, many silicate containing compositions are described that effectively remove metal-containing ash residues without causing corrosion.<br>
[0012]	The use of a quaternary ammonium hydroxide in photoresist strippers<br>
is disclosed in US Patent Nos. 4,776,892, 5,563,119, and 4,744,834, and in JP 09319098 A2; EP 578507 A2; WO 9117484 A1. The use of chelating and complexing agents to sequester metals in various cleaners has also been reported in WO 9705228, US 5,466,389, US 5,498,293, EP 812011, US 5,561,105, JP 06216098, JP 0641773, JP 06250400 and GB 1,573,206.<br>
[0013]	The use of an alkyl ammonium hydroxide solution containing a<br>
surfactant capable of forming a monolayer absorbed onto the sidewall of a patterned metal layer is disclosed in US Patent No. 6,057,240 for use as a post etch residue remover used in the fabrication process of a microelectonic device.<br>
[0014]	Photoresist developers containing tetramethylammonium hydroxide<br>
have also been disclosed as being useful for removing post via etch polymers in US Patent Nos. 5,412,868 and US 5,597,983 and EP 540261 B1.<br>
[0015]	US Patent No. 5,466,389 discloses an aqueous alkaline containing<br>
cleaning solution for microelectronics substrates that contains a quaternary ammonium hydroxide and optional metal chelating agents and is useful for a pH range of about 8 to 10.<br><br>
[0016]	US Patent No. 5,498,293 discloses a process for using an aqueous<br>
alkaline cleaning solution that contains a quaternary ammonium hydroxide and optional metal chelating agents useful for cleaning silicon wafers. The disclosure of this cleaning process is for treatments to substrates before the presence of integrated metal circuits and is used to generate a wafer surface that is essentially silicon dioxide free and would be employed before the use of photoresist for integrated circuit fabrication. The present invention, in contrast, focuses on the cleaning of wafers with integrated circuits present which have been photoresist coated, etched, and oxygen plasma ashed.<br>
[0017]	There is a further need for compositions that are able to more<br>
effectively clean plasma etch and/or ash residue from semiconductor wafers without causing significant corrosion of the exposed metal and damage to the dielectric features found on these semiconductor wafers,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]	It  is,   therefore,   a  feature   of the   present  invention  to  provide<br>

[0021]	The compositions clean wafer substrates by removing metallic and<br>
organic contamination. Importantly, the cleaning process does not damage integrated circuits on the wafer substrates and avoids the expense and adverse consequences associated with intermediate rinses required in prior methods.<br>

present in the composition in an amount of from about 0% to about 99%, preferably from about 1% to about 99%, and wore preferably from about 25% to about 98%, by weight of the composition.<br>
[0027]	The compositions of the present invention may also contain one or<br>
more suitable water-soluble organic solvents or co-solvents. The solvents and co-solvents may be present in the composition in an amount of from 0 to about 90%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 80%, and more preferably from about 1% to about 30%, by weight based on the total composition. Among the various organic solvents and co-solvents suitable are alcohols, polyhydroxy alcohols, glycols, glycoi ethers, alkyl-pyrrolidinones such as N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), 1-hydroxyalkyl-2-pyrrolidinones such as 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (HEP), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), sulfolane, dimethyl-2-piperidone (DMPD) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). These solvents may be added to reduce aluminum and/or aluminum-copper alloy and/or copper corrosion rates if further aluminum and/or aluminum-copper alloy and/or copper corrosion inhibition is desired. Preferred water-soluble organic solvents are polyhydroxy alcohols such as glycerol and/or 1-hydroxyalkyl-2-pyrrolidinones such as 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (HEP).<br>

Suitable metal ion-free materials useful for generating silicates in the cleaner are solid silicon wafers, silicic add, colloidal silica, fumed silica or any other suitable form of silicon or silica. Metal silicates such as sodium metasilicate may be used but are not recommended due to the detrimental effects of metallic contamination on integrated circuits.<br>
[0030]	The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated<br>
with suitable metal chelating or complexing agents to increase the capacity of the<br>
formulation to retain metals in solution and to enhance the dissolution of metallic<br>

The surfactant may also be added to reduce aluminum corrosion rates if further aluminum corrosion inhibition is desired. The surfactant will generally be present in the composition in an amount of from about 0 to about 5%, preferably from about 0.1 to 3%, by weight of the composition.<br>

Mixtures of suitable bath stabilizing agents may be used.<br><br>
[0043]	The bath stabilizing agent may generally be employed in a the<br>
composition in an amount of from about 0% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 35%, by weight of the composition.<br>
[0044]	The compositions of this invention may also contain other metal<br>
corrosion inhibitors, such as for example, benzotriazole, substituted benzotriazoles such as 5-methylbenzotriazole, pyrocatechol, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 4-terf-butylcatechol, aromatic esters such as alkyi 3,4-dihydroxybenzoates, alkyl-2,4-dihydroxybenzoates, alkyl 3,5-dihydroxybenzoates, alkyl 2,6-dhfydroxybenzoates and alkyl 2,5-dihydroxybenzoates, alkyl gallates such as methylgallate, ethylgallate, propylgaliate and butylgallate, pyrogallol, and gallic acid, may be employed in an amount of from 0 to about 5 wt%, preferably from about 0.1 to 2 wt%.<br>
[0045]	The   cleaning   compositions   may   also   optionally   contain   fluoride<br>

[0047]	The cleaning compositions of this invention also optionally contain an<br>
oxidizing agent to provide further protection against metal, especially aluminum, corrosion. Any suitable oxidizing agent, including, but not limited to, hydrogen peroxide, persulfates, perphosphates, hyposulfites, hypochlorites and the like may be employed in the cleaning compositions of this invention. The preferred oxidizing agents are hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite. The amount of oxidizing agent employed will generally be in an amount of from 0% up to about 9%, preferably from about 0.25% to about 8%, more preferably from about 0.5% to 3%, and most preferably from about 0.6% to about 1.6%, by weight of the composition.<br>
[0048]	The method of the present invention cleans semiconductor wafer<br>
substrates by exposing the contaminated substrate to the compositions of the present invention for a time and at a temperature sufficient to clean unwanted contaminants from the substrate surface. Optionally, the substrate is rinsed to remove the composition and the contaminants and dried to remove any excess solvents or rinsing agents. The substrate can then be used for its intended purpose.<br>
[0049]	Preferably, the method uses a bath or spray application to expose the<br>
substrate to the composition. Bath or spray cleaning times are generally 1 minute to 30 minutes, preferably 5 minutes to 20 minutes. Bath or spray cleaning temperatures are generally 10°C to 85°C, preferably 20°C to 65°C.<br>
[0050]	If required, the rinse times are generally 10 seconds to 5 minutes at<br>
room temperature, preferably 30 seconds to 2 minutes at room temperature. Preferably de-ionized water is used to rinse the substrates.<br>
[0051]	If required, drying the substrate can be accomplished using any<br>
combination of air-evaporation, heat, spinning, or pressurized gas. The preferred drying technique is spinning under a filtered inert gas flow, such as nitrogen, for a period of time until the wafer substrate i* rfrv.<br><br>
[0052]	The method of the present invention is very effective for cleaning<br>
semiconductor wafer substrates that have been previously oxygen plasma ashed to remove bulk photoresist, particularly wafer substrates containing a silicon, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, tungsten, tungsten alloy, titanium, titanium alloy, tantalum, tantalum alloy, copper, copper alloy, aluminum or aluminum alloy film. The method removes unwanted metallic and organic contaminants but does not cause unacceptable corrosion to the silicon, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, tungsten, tungsten alloy, titanium, titanium alloy, tantalum, tantalum alloy, copper, copper alloy, aluminum or aluminum alloy film.<br>
[0053]	The following examples illustrate the specific embodiment of the<br>
invention described in this document. As would be apparent to skilled artisans, various changes and modifications are possible and are contemplated within the scope of the invention described.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0054]	The test procedures for the examples were as follows.<br>
Aluminum Metal Etch-Rate Determination: Strips of Aluminum foil (99.8% pure, 0.05mm thickness, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) was cut into strips 50mm x 13mm then cleaned as follows: rinsed with de-ionized water, isopropyl alcohol and then acetone followed by drying in an oven. An initial weight was recorded using a 5-decimal precision analytical balance. The foil was then added to the apparatus comprising a Teflon capped 100ml Teflon PFA bottle filled with the test solution and equipped with a Teflon stir bar, with the cap having a hole for a Teflon temperature probe. The bottle is set upon a digital hot plate stirrer. The aluminum foil was placed ion the solution in the bottle for 60 minutes at 45°C with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir-bar stirring at a rate of 150 rpm. After the treatment was completed, the foil was removed, rinsed with de-ionized water, isopropyl alcohol and then acetone followed by drying in an oven. The final weight was recorded using the precision analytical balance.   The weight loss in grams was used to calculate the metal etch-rate in<br><br>
Angstroms per minute using the following equation: {[[(grams wt. loss) / (grams starting wt.)] * (mm foil thickness / 2)] / 60 min.} * (1x107 Angstroms/mm) = Etch Rate in Angstroms per minute.<br>
Titanium Metal Etch-Rate Determination: Titanium foil (99.94% pure, 0.025mm thickness, purchased from Alfa Aesar, Inc.) was cut into strips 30mm x 25mm and then bent in half to a 90 degree angle. The foil was then cleaned as follows: rinsed with de-ionized water, isopropyl alcohol and then acetone followed by drying in an oven. An initial weight was recorded using a 5-decimal precision analytical balance. A 125 ml polyethylene wide-mouth bottle containing the solution to be tested was pre-heated to 45°C in an oven for approximately one hour prior to adding the foil. The foil was added so that the foil stood on edge and the cap loosely fitted on the bottle for 24 hours (1,440 min.) at 45°C in the oven. Solutions were not agitated during the treatment time. After the treatment was completed, the foil was removed, rinsed with de-ionized water, isopropyl alcohol and then acetone followed by drying in an oven. The final weight was recorded using the precision analytical balance. The weight loss in grams was used to calculate the metal etch-rate in Angstroms per minute using the following equation: {[[(grams wt. loss) / (grams starting wt.)] * (mm foil thickness / 2)] /1,440 min.} * (1x107 Angstroms/mm) = Etch Rate in Angstroms per minute.<br>
FE-SEM Examples: Wafer samples with one micron wide features and aluminum-copper raised lines capped with titanium-nitride that had been previously prepared as follows: (a) metallization with aluminum-copper alloy followed by titanium nitride (b) lithographic patterning using a photoresist material (c) pattern transfer using reactive ion etching (d) oxygen plasma ashing to remove organic photoresist residues, but leaving mainly inorganic residues behind were used to evaluate the performance of the solutions. A wafer sample was placed in the solution at 45°C for 20 minutes, removed, rinsed with de-ionized water and dried with pressurized nitrogen gas. After drying, the sample was inspected on a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) to determine the extent of cleaning and/or corrosion of the aluminum-copper metal features.<br><br>
[0055]	The amount of aluminum or aluminum-copper alloy metal corrosion is<br>
expressed as both percent metal loss and as a general corrosion remark. The general corrosion remarks given are very slight, slight, light, moderate and severe. A small amount of aluminum corrosion considered to be within acceptable limits were assigned very slight or slight. Light, moderate or severe corrosion were considered to be unacceptable. All cleaning and corrosion data entries generated using the Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) was based on a visual interpretation of differences between untreated and treated samples from the same wafer. The reduction in aluminum and aluminum-copper alloy corrosion rate with the use of the inhibitors of this invention is demonstrated in Examples 1 and 3. The reduction in titanium corrosion rate with the use of the inhibitors of this invention is demonstrated in Example 2.<br>
