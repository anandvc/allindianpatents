The compounds according to the invention can thus be prepared as described by way of example in the following examples below, or starting from corresponding starting compounds using analogous process steps (see, for example, WO 98/42707, WO 98/54188, WO00/17200 and WO00/26217), or as outlined very generally in the following schemes.<br>
Scheme 1:<br>
Preparation of compounds 1 where X = NH, R4a or R4b = hydroxyl, R5a/R5b = H and any desired substituents R3a and R3b<br><br>
Prot in the above scheme represents any desired protective group, for example a pivaloyl group. The introduction of the acetyl group, the condensation with the aldehyde Arom-CHO, the ring closure and the reduction are carried out in a manner known per se. The derivatization, if desired, following this (e.g. conversion of the hydroxy group into an alkoxy group) is likewise carried out in a manner known per se, for example as described by way of example in international patent application WO 00/17200.<br><br>
Scheme 2:<br>
Preparation of compounds 1 where X = NH, R4a or R4b = hydroxyl, R5a or R5b = hydroxyl and any desired substituents R3a and R3b<br><br>
The 7-acetyl-8-aminoimidazopyridine used as a starting material is prepared as outlined in scheme 1. The additional epoxidation compared with scheme 1 is likewise carried out in a manner known per se, for example using hydrogen peroxide as an epoxidizing agent. Alternatively to schemes 1 and 2, the compounds where X = NH can also be prepared according to scheme 8 of international patent application WO98/42707, advantageously with protection of the hydroxy group of the phenylisoserine ester, for example using a suitable silyl group, or - if compounds where R5a/R5b = H are desired -using the corresponding propionic acid derivative without a 2-hydroxy group.<br>
While compounds 1 where X = O, R4a or R4b = hydroxyl, R5a/R5b = H and any desired substituents R3a and R3b can be prepared in analogy to scheme 1, compounds where X = O, R4a or R4b = hydroxyl, R5a or R5b = hydroxyl and any desired substituents R3a and R3b are advantageously prepared according to reaction scheme 3 below.<br><br>
Scheme 3:<br><br>
The above scheme 3 shows, by way of example, the enantioselective synthesis of a 7,8-diol (R4a or R4b and R5a or R5b are in each case hydroxyl), which, if desired, can then additionally be alkylated or its hydroxy groups can additionally be derivatized in a suitable manner (e.g. etherified or converted into the groups R41/R51 or R42/R52).<br>
The group Y in scheme 3 is a suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom, preferably chlorine, or a 1-4C alkoxy group, preferably methoxy. The acylation is carried out in the manner customary to the person skilled in the art, preferably using bis(trimethylsilyl)sodamide or potassamide if the leaving group is a chlorine atom.<br>
The oxidation following the acylation is likewise carried out under conditions which are customary per se, using chloranil, atmospheric oxygen, 2,3-dichJoro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone or manganese dioxide as an oxidant. For the subsequent removal of protective groups and cyclization, certain<br><br>
conditions are to be fulfilled with respect to the auxiliary acid to be used. Formic acid is advantageously employed as an auxiliary acid.<br>
The reduction to the diol is likewise carried out - as already in the case of the reduction according to scheme 2 - under standard conditions (see, for example, W098/54188), sodium borohydride, for example, being employed as a reductant, with the use of which the specified 7,8-trans-diol can be obtained in over 90% diastereomeric purity. The etherification which follows, if desired, and is likewise carried out in a manner customary per se, leads to the compounds of the formula 1* according to the invention in which R4a and R5b are hydrogen.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula 1 in which R5a and R5b are hydrogen, instead of the dioxolane in scheme 3, starting materials to be used are 3-hydroxypropionic acid derivatives (correspondingly protected on the hydroxy group) in which Y (analogously to the above scheme) is a suitable leaving group.<br>
The introduction of the "prodrug" radical R' subsequently to the synthesis for the formation of the substituents R41 or R51 carried out according to schemes 1 to 3 is carried out in the sense of an acylation reaction starting from compounds of the formula 1 in which at least one of the radicals R4a, R4b, R5a and R5b is a hydroxy group, by reaction with compounds of the formula R'-Z in which Z is a suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom. The reaction is carried out in a manner known per se, preferably in the presence of a suitable auxiliary base. For the preparation of the compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkoxy and R5a or R5b is the radical R5', compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkoxy and R5a or R5b is hydroxyl are reacted with compounds R'-Z. For the preparation of the compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a or R4b is hydroxyl and R5a or R5b is the radical R5', compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a and R4b together are O (oxygen) and R5a or R5b is hydroxyl are reacted with compounds R'-Z. The keto group is then reduced to the hydroxy group. In a similar manner, compounds of the formula 1 are obtained in which the "prodrug" radical is in the 7-position and the hydroxy group or the 1-4C-alkoxy or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkoxy radical is in the 8-position.<br>
The alkylation of the compounds obtained according to schemes 1 to 3 to give the compounds of the formula 1 in which R4a, R4b, R5a or R5b has the meaning 1-7C-alkyl, 2-7C-alkenyl, phenyl or phen-1-4C-alkyl can generally be carried out according to schemes 4 and 5 below.<br><br>
Scheme 4:<br>
Scheme 4 generally outlines the preparation of compounds 1 in which R4a or R4b has the meaning 1-7C-alkyl, 2-7C-alkenyl, phenyl or phen-1-4C-alkyl.<br><br>
The introduction of the radical R4a or R4b (called R4 for short) in the 7-position is carried out by reaction with a suitable organometallic (M = metal) compound (e.g. methyllithium, phenyllithium, 2,2-dimethylvinylmagnesium bromide etc.) in a manner known per se. The 8-OH group is optionally to be protected, for example using a suitable silyl radical. The alkylated product obtained can then be reacted further, if desired, as described or in a manner known per se (etherification, introduction of a "prodrug" radical etc.).<br>
Schema 5:<br>
Scheme 5 generally outlines the preparation of compounds in which R5a or R5b has the meaning 1-7C-alkyl, 2-7C-alkenyl, phenyl or phen-1-4C-alkyl.<br><br>
The introduction of the radical R5a or R5b (abbreviated to R5) in the 8-position is carried out, for example, by reaction with a suitable halide (Hal = halogen), such as, for example, methyl iodide, benzyl bromide etc., under suitable, preferably basic conditions in a manner known per se. Advantageously, the reaction can also be carried out under phase-transfer conditions. The alkylated product obtained can then be reacted further, if desired, as described or in a manner known per se (reduction of the 7-oxo group, etherification, introduction of a "prodrug" radical etc.).<br>
With regard to the specific preparation and isolation of the pure enantiomers, reference is made, for example, to the corresponding details in WO00/17200.<br><br>
The starting compounds shown in schemes 1 to 3 are known (see, for example, EP-A-299470, Kaminski et al., J. Med. Chem. 1985, 28, 876-892, 1989, 32, 1686-1700 and 1991, 34, 533-541 and Angew, Chem. 1996, 108, 589-691) or they can be prepared in a manner analogous to the known compounds, for example according to reaction scheme 6 below.<br>
Scheme 6:<br>
Exemplary preparation of starting compounds needed according to scheme 3 where R1, R2 = methyl and various substituents R3b.<br><br>
The reactions to give the 8-benzyloxy-6-bromoimidazopyridines are carried out in a manner such as is known to the person skilled in the art. The conversion of the bromine atom into an ethyl ester radical<br><br>
can be carried out in various ways, for example using the Heck reaction (using Pd(ll), carbon monoxide and ethanol) or by metallation in the 6-position (using lithium or magnesium) and subsequent Grignard reaction. The metallation also offers the possibility of introducing other desired groups R3b in position 6, for example fluorine, chlorine or the carboxy group. Starting from the ester group, further desired groups R3b can be introduced into position 6, for example hydroxy-1-4C-alkyl radicals (in particular the hydroxymethyl radical), by reduction of the ester radical with lithium aluminum hydride, or 1-4C-alkoxy-1-4C-alkyl radicals (in particular 1-4C-alkoxymethyl radicals) by subsequent etherification as outlined in scheme 6.<br>
The debenzylation/reduction is likewise carried out in a manner known per se, for example using hydrogen/Pd(0). If compounds where R3b = -CO-NR31R32 are desired, an appropriate derivatization can be performed in a manner known per se (conversion of an ester into an amide) at the stage of the 8-benzyloxy-6-ethoxycarbonyl compound or after the debenzylation/reduction, or alternatively also at a later point in time, e.g. at the stage of the acyloin (see schemes 2 and 3).<br>
Starting compounds having various substituents R1 and R2 are known, or they can be prepared - for example based on scheme 6 - in a known manner in analogy to known compounds. Alternatively, derivatizations can also be carried out at the stage of the compounds 1. It is thus possible, for example, starting from compounds where R2 = H, to prepare compounds where R2 = CH2OH (by Vilsmeier reaction and subsequent reduction), where R2 = CI or Br (by chlorination or bromination), where R2 = propynyl (from the corresponding bromo compound using the Sonogashira reaction) or where R2 = alkoxycarbonyl (from the corresponding bromo compound by Heck carbonylation).<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention in greater detail without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula 1 whose preparation is not described explicitly can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques. The abbreviation min stands for minute(s), h for hour(s) and ee for "enantiomeric excess".<br><br>

Commercial utility<br>
The compounds of the formula 1 and their salts have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. In particular they exhibit a marked inhibition of gastric secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action in warm-blooded animals, in particular humans. The compounds according to the invention are distinguished here by a high selectivity of action, an advantageous duration of action, a particularly good enteral activity, the absence of significant side effects and a great therapeutic breadth.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection" is understood in this connection as meaning the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal illnesses, in particular gastrointestinal inflammatory illnesses and lesions (such as, for example, stomach ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, hyperacidic or medicinally related functional gastropathy), which can be caused, for example, by microorganisms (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), bacterial toxins, medicaments (e.g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics), chemicals (e.g. ethanol), gastric acid or stress situations.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly prove to be clearly superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the antiulcerogenic and the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these properties, the compounds of the formula 1 and their pharmacologically tolerable salts are outstandingly suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br>
A further subject of the invention are therefore the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned illnesses.<br>
The invention likewise comprises the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned illnesses.<br>
The invention furthermore comprises the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned illnesses.<br>
A further subject of the invention are medicaments which contain one or more compounds of the formula 1 and/or their pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds (= active compounds) according to the invention are employed either as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical excipients or vehicles in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches (e.g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being<br><br>
between 0.1 and 95% and it being possible by the appropriate choice of the excipients and vehicles to obtain a pharmaceutical administration form exactly suited to the active compound and/or to the desired onset of action and/or to the duration of action (e.g. a delayed-release form or an enteric form).<br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with excipients or vehicles which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations. In addition to solvents, gel formers, suppository bases, tablet excipients and other active compound carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants or in particular permeation promoters and complexing agents (e.g. cyclodextrins).<br>
The active compounds can be administered orally, parenterally or percutaneously.<br>
In general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer the active compound(s) in the case of oral administration in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, preferably 0.05 to 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appropriate in the form of a number of, preferably 2 to 4, individual doses to achieve the desired result. In the case of parenteral treatment, similar or (in particular in the case of intravenous administration of the active compounds) as a rule lower doses can be used. Any person skilled in the art can easily fix the optimum dose and manner of administration of the active compounds necessary in each case on the basis of his/her expert knowledge.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention and/or their salts are to be employed for the treatment of the abovementioned illnesses, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more pharmacologically active constituents of other pharmaceutical groups. Examples which may be mentioned are: tranquillizers (for example from the group consisting of the benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam), spasmolytics (e.g. bietamiverine or camylofin), anticholinergics (e.g. oxyphencyclimine or phencarbamide), local anesthetics (e.g. tetracaine or procaine), and optionally also enzymes, vitamins or amino acids.<br>
In particular to be emphasized in this connection is the combination of the compounds according to the invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as, for example, H2 blockers (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine), H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole, pantoprazole), or further with 'peripheral' anticholinergics (e.g. pirenzepine, telenzepine) and with gastrin antagonists with the aim of increasing the main action in an additive or superadditive sense and/or of eliminating or reducing the side effects, or further the combination with antibacterially active substances (such as, for example, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, nitroimidazoles or alternatively bismuth salts) for controlling Helicobacter pylori. Antibacterially active combination components which may be mentioned are, for example, mezlocillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, imipenem, gentamycin, amikacin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, azithromycin and combinations thereof (e.g. clarithromycin + metronidazole).<br><br>

Methodology<br>
The abdomen of anesthetized rats (CD rats, female, 200-250 g; 1.5 g/kg i.m. urethane) was opened after tracheotomy by means of a median upper abdominal incision and a PVC catheter was fixed transorally in the esophagus and a further catheter via the pylorus such that the ends of the tubing just<br><br>
projected into the gastric lumen. The catheter leading from the pylorus led outwards through a side opening in the right abdominal wall.<br>
After thorough rinsing (about 50-100 ml), warm physiological NaCI solution at 37°C was continuously passed through the stomach (0.5 ml/min, pH 6.8-6.9; Braun-Unita I). The pH (pH meter 632, glass electrode EA 147; Φ = 5 mm, Metrohm), and, by titration with a freshly prepared 0.01 N NaOH solution to pH 7 (Dosimat 665 Metrohm), the secreted HCI were determined in the effluent in each case collected at an interval of 15 minutes.<br>
The gastric secretion was stimulated by continuous perfusion of 1 ug/kg (= 1.65 ml/h) of i.v. pentagastrin (left femoral vein) about 30 min after the end of the operation (i.e. after determination of 2 preliminary fractions). The substances to be tested were administered intraduodenaily in 2,5 ml/kg of liquid volume 60 min after the start of the pentagastrin continuous infusion.<br>
The body temperature of the animals was kept at a constant 37.8-38°C by infrared irradiation and heat pads (automatic, stepless control by means of rectal temperature sensors).<br><br><br>
