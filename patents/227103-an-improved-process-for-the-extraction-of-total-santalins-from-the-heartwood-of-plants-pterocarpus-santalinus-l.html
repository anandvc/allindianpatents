				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the isolation of total santalins from the heartwood of Pterocarpus santalinus L. (Red sandes) Red sanders, Pterocarpus santalinus (Fabaceae) is found in dry deciduous forests of Andhra Pradesh mostly in Cuddapah district. This species is also found in small pockets in adjoining Tamil Nadu State. The timber is hard and durable. It is used for agriculture implements for poles, shifts and bent rims of carts and other joinery purposes. It is exported to Japan where it is used in the manufacture of musical instrument called Shamisen.<br>
Red sanders wood mainly contains a red colouring matter , santalin (Santalic acid) possessing a quinonoid structure. Santalin yields a blood red solution with alcohol, yellow with ether, and violet with ammonia and caustic alkalies, but is insoluble in water. A variety of compounds including isoflavones stilbenes, pterocarpans and terpenes have been reported from the wood { Seshadri, T.R. (1972) Phytochem. 3,881}. The light petroleum ether extract contains (3-eudesmol (Parthasarthy, M.R. and Seshadri T.R. (1965) Curr. Sci. 34, 115}. The benzene extract is reported to contain pterostilbene, acetyl oleanolic aldehyde, cryptomeridiol, acetyl oleanolic acid, pterocarpol and isopterocarpolene {N. kumaretal (1974) Phytochem. 13,633-636}.<br>
The ground wood is chiefly used for dyeing wool, cotton, leather and for staining other woods. The dye is also used for colouring pharmaceutical preparations, foods stuffs and is suitable for colouring pulp. A histological stain has been prepared from the alcohol soluble fraction of the heartwood. The bark is sometimes used in the curing of arecanuts { Ann. (1969) wealth of India, Vol. 8, New Delhi, India , Publications and information Directorate, CSIR 305 -307}. The wood has been used for curing inflammations and<br><br>
head ache, as antipyretic, anthelmintic, aphrodisiac, alexeteric and in billiousness, mental aberrations and ulcers. An infusion of the wood has been used in the control of diabetes. (Kirtikar K.R.., Basu B.D. Indian medicinal plants vol. 1 Indian, Periodical Experts 1981 : 826 ). Large quantities of Red sanders wood are said to have been exported regularly from this country to Europe, where it is employed for extraction of dye. Red sanders is exported to Japan, Hongkong, Germany and Ceylon. Exports of red sandal powder from India averaged 50 tonnes annually between 1988-1993 . The major importers have been Japan, China (Taiwan province) and western Europe .<br>
Only the heartwood is employed as a source of the colourant. The process involves reduction of the wood to chips or powdering and using as such. No reliable published information is available on commercial extraction audits yield.<br>
For sale to end users, specific formulations (as liquid, dispersed solids or water soluble forms) are prepared at strengths appropriate for the food product. The pigment of red sandal wood and of related red woods have attracted the interest of natural product chemists for more than a century since the first report by Pelletier ( Pelletier., J., Annalen, 1833, 6 : 28 ) Despite much effort, it was not until 1954 that two pure compounds santalin and santarubin were isolated by Roberton and Whalley ( Robertsen, A., and Whalley, W.B., ( 1954 ) J. Chem. Soc. 2794 ) . The presence of two pigments , santalin A and B were reported by Ravindranath and Seshadri ( Ravindranath, B and Seshadri, T.R., ( 1972 ) Tet. Letts 1201 ). Santalin A, B and C were reported by Arnone, et al ( Arnone, A. et al ( 1975 ) J.C.S Perkin I, 186 ). Arnone isolated the santalin by extracting the heartwood shavings with hexane, then with chloroform and ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was concentrated and the residue<br><br>
chromatographed through a woolen polyamide column (CHCl3-MeOH) to give red<br>
products of which santalins A and B were the major constituents.<br>
Kumar, N. et al., [Kumar , N et al (1975) J.C.S. Perkin I, 186] separated mixture of<br>
santalin A and B alongwith one major and minor constituent by extracting the sapwood<br>
shavings with light petroleum, chloroform and ethanol in succession. Chloroform and<br>
ethanol extracts were combined and solvent removed. The residue dissolved in hot<br>
benzene and left overnight in the refrigerator. The mother liquor after filtration of the<br>
content was enriched with santalin. This was chromatographed over polyamide column<br>
to obtain santalins.<br>
[Kumar, N., Seshadri, T.R., (1974) Curr. Sci., 43, 611].<br>
Robertson &amp; Whalley isolated santalins by extracting the powdered sandalwood with<br>
carbon tetrachloride followed by diethyl ether. Ether extract after evaporating the solvent,<br>
dissolved in ethyl acetate which on keeping the content as such gave a solid. This solid<br>
on crystallization from alcohol yielded santalins. (Robertson, A., and Whalley, W.B.<br>
(1954) /. Chem. Soc. 2794].<br>
The methods described in the literature has following disadvantages:<br>
1.	No published information is available on commercial extraction and its yields.<br>
2.	Ternary and quaternary mixtures of solvents have been employed for extraction of<br>
santalins.<br>
3.	Estimation and quantitation of total santalin has not been determined in the product.<br>
Santalin has been separated by using polyamide column.<br>
4.	Summary of basic information  on red sandal wood, rated the availability of reliable<br>
published information as poor.<br><br>
5. For the food industries, the extract is normally sold in the alcohol soluble form either as liquids or powders. The purification of the extract has not been reported in the literature.<br>
Present status initiated us to develop a simple and economical process for the isolation of total santalins without resorting to chromatography procedures. However, applications of this concept was not obvious, without carrying out the experiments.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a simple economical process for the isolation of total santalins from the red sanders wood. Another object is to provid a process by which total santalins can be separated in powder form. Yet another object is to provide a process in which no organic solvents are employed to separate and purify the total santalins from red sanders.<br>
