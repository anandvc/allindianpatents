DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERABLE EMBODIMENT<br>
A method for transmitting digital message is realized as the follows..<br>
A generating matrix of operations G with k rows and (k+1) columns is formed, said matrix is produced with a help of a kxk matrix with operations g° at its diagonal and operations g1 at other positions and with a help of an additional column, which is added from the right to said kxk matrix and corresponds to a sequence of operations g° or operations g2, situated at every position. It's possible, also, to use a generating matrix of operations, produced with a help of said generating matrix of operations by rearranging its rows and/or columns. The resulting generating matrix of operations is a matrix, formed not of numbers, as usual matrixes, but of records, recommending to produce a corresponding operation in situations, when a corresponding element of a generating matrix of operations is initiated.<br>
An operation of adding additional column is produced with a purpose to introduce, into a transmitted message, check elements which are used for finding out<br><br>
errors in a received message, if they appear in a process of a message transmission through a communication channel.<br>
A digital message Xk, generated with a corresponding source, is encoded by producing generalized matrix multiplication of a vector-row Xk into an above-mentioned generating matrix of operations G.<br>
A procedure of a generalized matrix multiplication operation is quite the same with a procedure of a usual matrix multiplication because it's produced in the same way, as the following: paired interaction operations are produced for a i-th element of a vector-row Xk and every ij-th element (which is situated at a crossing of a i-th row and a j-th column) of an operation matrix G and than results of i-th operations are summed with forming a j-th element of a vector-row Yn. As a result, every above-mentioned operation, which is required for producing generalized matrix multiplication operation, can be interpreted as a summing operation in accordance with rules, formulated for elements of an Abelian group [2, p. 140], which contains elements of a digital message Xk (with k information elements), formed with a corresponding source. Operations gv (g0, g1 and g2) correspond to summing operations with a unity element of a group [2, p. 139], to summing operations with an inverse element of a group [2, p. 140] and to two-fold summing operations with an inverse element of a group, correspondingly.<br>
An encoded message is modulated and transmitted to a communication channel.<br>
A received message is demodulated and decoded. Decoding is produced using operations of a generalized matrix multiplication of a check matrix H by a transposed vector-row YnT.<br>
A 1 xn check matrix of operations H is formed by transposing additional matrix, by adding operation g° to this matrix from the right, if an additional column corresponds to a sequence of operations g , or in the same way with changing operations g2for g0, if an additional column corresponds to a sequence of operations g2, and by rearranging columns (if an generating matrix of operations formation was done by rearranging columns) in the same way with rearranging columns for an generating matrix of operations.<br>
If a value, got as a result of a multiplication, equals a unity element of a group (this fact informs about an error absence in a received message), an element with number, corresponding to a number of an additional column in an generating matrix of operations G, is excluded from a vector-row Yn; so, a check element, inserted into a message during a process of encoding, is discarded.<br>
If message elements belong to a ring with a unity, which corresponds to one of the variants for an additive Abelian group, operations g0 degenerate into operations with a multiplication into a unity, operations g1 degenerate into operations with a multiplication into a zero and operations g2 degenerate into operations with a multiplication into a minus unity.<br>
If message elements belong to a residue class ring on the modulo q, which corresponds to one of the variants for a ring with a unity, an operation  is transformed into an operation of summing on the modulo q.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates an example of transmitting message Xk, consisting of seven binary elements. An generating matrix of operations G is formed in accordance with the above-mentioned rule. In this case an additional column is inserted in the first position.<br><br>
After producing generalized matrix multiplication of a vector-row Xk into a matrix G an encoded message vector-rowYn with a check element in the first position is formed.<br>
A demodulated message Ynis received without errors. So, producing generalized matrix YnT element of a group. Than decoding is done by discarding check element, in particular by extracting elements of an initial message.<br>
A system for transmitting digital message is operated in the following way.<br>
Every element of a digital message Xk, formed with a corresponding source and consisting of consequently transmitted code words with a size of k elements each, gets at an input of an encoder 1 and further at information inputs of the first operative memory unit 16 and the calculation unit 8. At the same time this element starts the first pulse shape forming unit 7 and synchronizes the pulse generator 9. A pulse from an output of the first pulse shape forming unit 7 starts the first ring counter 11. The first counter 11 provides counting for pulses, coming at its input, and elements of a code word are stored in corresponding cells of the first operative memory unit 16 and are conversed with the calculation unit 8 in accordance with a rule g . Results of a conversion, produced for message elements, are transferred to an input of a first accumulating adder 12, where every next conversed element is summarized with a sum of previous elements in accordance with a rule for summing elements of an Abelian group, and forming a check element for its inserting into a transmitted code word. After transferring a k-th element of a code word to an input of the first ring counter 11a pulse is formed at its overflow output and this pulse opens the first switch 17, resets the first operative memory unit 16 and transfers an information from outputs of the first operative memory unit 16 to first k memory cells of the second operative memory unit 19. At the same time this pulse transfers an information from outputs of the first adder 12 to a (k+l)-th memory cell of the second operative memory unit 19. Pulses from an output of the generator 9 with a repetition frequency value, exceeding (k+l)/k times a repetition frequency value for elements in a code word, get at an information input of the second switch 13, which, being kept initially in a closed state, doesn't transfer them to an input of the first ring counter 20. The same pulses are transferred to an input of the first frequency doubling unit 10, which doubles a repetition frequency for coming pulses. Then pulses are transferred from an output of the unit 10 to an input of the ring counter 14. When a (2k+l)-th pulse is transferred (approximately in a middle of a time interval between a moment, when the last element of a current code word comes to an input of an encoder 1, and a moment, when the first element of a next code word comes to this input) to an input of the ring counter 14, a pulse is formed at an overflow output of the counter 14 and is transferred to a counting input of the first flip-flop 18, changing a state of this flip-flop. A voltage signal of a "logical unity", formed at an output of the first flip-fiop 18, is transferred to a direct input of the first gate AND 15. The first ring counter 20 hasn't begun to count, yet, and a voltage signal of a "logical zero" is kept at its overflow output; so, a voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at an output of the first gate AND 15 and this signal helps to open the second switch 13. Pulses from an output of the generator 9 begins to come to an input of the first ring coimter 20; as a result, a code appears at an information output of the counter 20 and this code is changed with every next counted pulse. This code, after getting at an address input of the second operative memory unit 19, initializes an information reset in its corresponding memory cell, using the same sequential number with a pulse, counted with the first ring counter 20, and k information<br><br>
and one check elements of a code word are transferred sequentially to an input of a modulator 2. After transferring a n-th pulse to an input of the first ring counter 20 a voltage signal of a "logical unity" is formed at its overflow output and this voltage signal changes a state of the first flip 18; so, a voltage signal of a "logical zero" appears at an output of the first gate AND 15 and this voltage signal closes the first switch 13 and stops getting pulses from an output of the generator 9 to an input of the second ring counter 20, which gets prepared for a next operation cycle.<br>
A modulated message is transferred from an output of a modulator 2 to an input of a transmitter 3 and further to a communication channel.<br>
A received message, after being transferred through a receiver 4, gets demodulated in a demodulator 5 and is transferred to an input of a decoder 6.<br>
Every element in a received code word gets, after being transferred to an input of a decoder 6, at information inputs of the third operative memory unit 27 and the calculation unit 22, starts the second pulse shape forming unit 21 and synchronizes the generator 23. A pulse from an output of the second pulse shape forming unit 21 starts the second ring counter 25. When the second ring counter 25 counts pulses, coming to its input, elements of a code word are stored in corresponding cells of the third operative memory unit 27 and the second accumulating adder 22 determines a result of summing elements of a code word, received at its input, in accordance with a rule of summing elements of an Abelian group. After transferring a (k+l)-th element of a code word to an input of the second ring counter 25 a pulse is formed at its overflow output and this pulse opens the third switch 28, resets the third operative memory unit 27 and transfers an information from its outputs to memory cells of the fourth operative memory unit 33 and from outputs of the second accumulating unit 22 to the identification unit 31, correspondingly. When a sum, getting at an input of the identification unit 31, equals a unity element of an Abelian group, a voltage signal of a "logical unity" is transferred to a control input of the fourth switch 34 and this switch gets opened. Pulses from an output of the generator 23 with a repetition frequency, value of which is exceeded k/(k+l) times with a value of a repetition frequency for elements in a code word, get to an information input of the fifth switch 26, which, being kept initially in a closed state, doesn't transfer these pulses to an input of the second ring counter 35. The same pulses are transferred to an input of the second frequency doubling unit 24, which doubles a repetition frequency for coming pulses; pulses from an output of the unit 24 are transferred to an input of the second ring counter 30. When a [2(k+l)+l]-th pulse gets (approximately in a middle of a time interval between a moment, when the last element of a current code word comes to an input of a decoder 6, and a moment, when the first element of a next code word comes to this input) at an input of the ring counter 30, a pulse from an overflow output of the counter 30 is transferred to a counting input of the second flip-flop 32 and changes a state of this flip-flop. A voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at an output of the second flip-flop 32 and this voltage signal is transferred to a direct input of the second gate AND 29. The second ring counter 35 hasn't begun to count, yet, and a voltage signal of a "logical zero" is kept at its overflow output; so, a voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at an output of the second gate AND 29 and opens the fifth switch 26. Pulses from an output of the generator 23 begins to come to an input of the second ring counter 35; as a result, a code appears at an information input of this counter and this code is changed with every next counted pulse. This code is transferred through the just opened<br><br>
fourth switch 38 and, after getting at address input of the fourth operative memory unit 33, initializes an information reset it its cell with a sequential number, corresponding to a number of a pulse, counted with the second ring counter 35, and k information elements of a code word are transferred sequentially to a decoder output, in particular to a user. A check element is kept, as discarded, in a (k+l)-th memory cell of the fourth operative memory unit 33 and is changed in this cell with a check element of a next code word. After transferring a k-th pulse to an input of the second ring counter 35 a voltage signal of a "logical unity" appears at its overflow output and this voltage signal changes a state of the first flip-flop 32; then a voltage signal of a "logical zero" is formed at an output of the second gate AND 29 and this voltage signal closes the fifth switch 26 and stops getting pulses from an output of the generator 23 to an input of the second ring counter 35, which gets prepared for a next operation cycle.<br>
