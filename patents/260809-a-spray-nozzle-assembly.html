IMPROVED INTERNAL MIX AIR ATOMIZING NOZZLE ASSEMBLY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]       This application claims the priority of U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/603,844, filed August 23, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       The present invention relates generally to spray nozzles, and more particularly, to internal-mix, air-atomizing spray nozzles of the type in which a liquid flow stream is pre-atomized by pressurized air internally within the nozzle prior to discharge.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]       Internal mix air atomizing nozzles are known in the art, such as shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,732,885 assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such air atomizing nozzles are particularly effective for generating and discharging a finely atomized liquid spray at high flow rates.<br>
[0004]       Pressurized air sources available in customer plants sometimes are inadequate to enable such spray nozzles to be operated with optimum liquid atomization, particularly in spraying systems which involve a large number of such air atomizing nozzles. The need exists for air atomizing nozzles that can be optimally operated with lesser pressurized air requirements so as to (1) permit more economical use of smaller air compressors and (2) to enable greater numbers of air assisted spray nozzles to be operated from existing pressurized air sources.   The need also exists for spray nozzles which are adapted to effect finer atomization of the liquid and whi^h do not accumulate liquid within the nozzle body that can cause undesirable drippage from the nozzle, which detracts from the spray performance.<br><br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]       It is an object of the invention to provide an internal-mix spray nozzle assembly adapted for more efficiently generating air-atomized liquid spray discharges.<br>
[0006]      Another object is to provide a spray nozzle assembly as characterized above that can be operated for optimum spraying with lesser pressurized air requirements.<br>
[0007]      A further object is to provide a spray nozzle assembly of the above kind that is operable for discharging more finely atomized liquid spray patterns.<br>
[0008]       Still another object is to provide an internal mix air atomizing spray nozz assembly of the foregoing type which is adapted for finely atomizing the liquid, while preventing the accumulation of liquid within the housing and resulting undesirable drippage from the nozzle during spray operations.<br>
[0009]      A yet further object is to provide a spray nozzle assembly of the above kind that is relatively simple in construction and economical to manufacture and operate.<br>
[0010]       Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upoi reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011]      FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal section of an illustrative air assisted spray nozzle assembly in accordance with the invention;<br>
[0012]      Fig. 2 is a downstream end view of the spray nozzle assembly shown in Fig. 1;<br>
[0013]      Fig. 3 is an enlarged fragmentary section of the encircled portion of the illustrated spray nozzle assembly indicated in Fig. 1; and<br><br>
[0014]      Fig. 4 is a transverse section of the spray nozzle assembly, taken in line of line 4-4 in Fig. 1.<br>
[0015]       While the invention is susceptible of various modifications and alternative constructions, a certain illustrated embodiment thereof has been shown in the drawings and will be described below in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0016]      Referring now more particularly to the drawings, there is shown an illustrative internal-mix, air-atomizing spray nozzle assembly 10 in accordance with the invention connected to a conventional fluid supply manifold 11. The fluid supply manifold 11 in this case includes a central pressurized liquid supply passage 12 and a plurality of pressurized air supply passages 14 in surrounding relation to the liquid supply passage 12. The air passages 14 in this instance communicate with an annular manifold air passage 15 at a downstream end of the fluid supply manifold 11.<br>
[0017]      The illustrated spray nozzle assembly 10 basically comprises a nozzle body 20, a downstream spray tip 21, and an air guide 22 interposed between the nozzle body 20 and spray tip 21. The nozzle body 20 in this case is in the form of a multipart fluid supply subassembly comprising an outer annular body member 24 and an inner axial liquid supply tube 25 fixed therein which defines a liquid discharge orifice 27. The outer annular body member 24 has an externally threaded, upstream stem 26 secured within a threaded axial bore of the fluid supply manifold 11 with the liquid supply tube 25 in fluid communication with the liquid passage 12. An annular sealing gasket 28 in this case is interposed between the annular body member 24 and the downstream end of the fluid supply manifold 11. The annular body member 24 further is formed with a plurality of circumferentially spaced axial air passageways 29 that communicate between the annular manifold air passage 15 and an air chamber 30 about the liquid supply tube 25.<br><br>
[0018]       The spray tip 21 is secured to the nozzle body 20 by a threaded coupling nut 31 with the air guide 22 retained between an upstream end of the spray tip 21 and a counter bore 34 in the downstream end of the outer nozzle body member 24. A downstream elid of the liquid supply tube 25 and a central bore 35 of the air guide 22 are formed with respective tapered surfaces 38, 39, which define an inwardly converging, annular air passageway 40. The annular air passageway 40 directs pressurized air from the annular air chamber 30 into an expansion chamber 42 within the spray tip 21 simultaneously as liquid is directed through and discharges from a downstream discharge orifice 27 of the liquid supply tube 25. The discharging liquid impacts with a primary transverse impingement surface 44 of an upstanding impingement pin or pintel 45 of the spray tip 219 which facilitates both mechanical and air atomized liquid particle breakdown of the liquid as it is dispersed laterally of the impingement surface 44. The lateral liquid dispersion is further broken down and atomized oy the annular air flow stream prior to discharge from the spray tip 21 through a plurality of circumferentially spaced discharge orifices 46 disposed in surrounding relation to the impingement pin 45, which effect further liquid particle breakdown and atomizations.<br>
[0019]      In accordance with the invention, the air guide is designed to more efficiently atomize and break down liquid into finer liquid particles with lesser pressurized air requirements. To this end, the annular air passageway 40 defined between the air guide 22 and liquid supply tube 25 has a relatively narrow width w for accelerating and substantially increasing the pressure of air stream directed into the spray tip for enhanced atomization of liquid impinging the impingement surface 44. The ratio of the flow area of the annular air passageway 40 and the area of the liquid discharge orifice 2? of the liquid supply passageway 25 a preferably is between 1:2 and 1:3, and most preferably, about 1:2.5. The ratio of the flow area of the annular air passageway 40 and the transverse area of the spray tip expansion chamber 42, as defined by the diameter "d5S of the expansion chamber 42, preferably is between 1:27 and 1:33, and most preferably, about 1:30. In the illustrated embodiment, the area of the air passageway 40 between the air guide 22 and liquid supply tube 25 is 0.06 square inches, the area of the liquid supply passage 25a and the discharge orifice 27 thereof is 0.15 square inches, and the area of the expansion chamber 42 is 1.83 square inches. The resulting increase in pressure and velocity of the air stream discharging from the annular air passageway 40 more aggressively engages and interacts with the liquid impinging transversely from the impingement surface 44 for more effective atomization.<br><br>
[0020]      In carrying out the invention;, the impingement pin 45 has a relatively large impingement surface 44 that causes the liquid striking the impingement surface to proceed transversely outwardly in a relatively thin sheet as it approaches the peripheral edge of the impingement pin for enhanced interaction and atomization by the high pressurized air stream. The ratio of the area of the impingement surface 44 to the area of the expansion chamber 42 preferably is between about 1:3.8 to 1:4.4, and most preferably, about 1:4. It will be appreciated that the expansion chamber 42 is sufficiently large to prevent the atomized liquid particles generated therein to commingle together and reform into larger particles prior to discharge from the spray nozzle..<br>
[0021]       In carrying out this aspect of the invention, in order to provide sufficient volume within the spray tip for expansion of the liquid particles upon atomization, the air guide 22 does not extend substantially beyond the downstream end of the liquid supply f*:be 25. In the illustrated embodiment, the downstream end of the air guide 22 is substantially co-planar with the downstream end of the liquid supply tube 25.<br>
[0022]      In keeping with a further feature of the invention, the spray tip 21 is formed with a secondary impingement surface 50 downstream of and parallel to the primary impingement surface 44 for further breaking down the liquid particles prior to direction through the spray tip discharge orifices 46. In the illustrated embodiment, the impingement pin 45 is defined by a separate pintel concentrically mounted within the spray tip which defines both the upper primary impingement surface 44 ana the downstream or secondary annular impingement surface 50. The downstream annular impingement surface 50 in this case is in the form of a small radial ledge with an outer peripheral sharp corner 51 which further shears the liquid particles as they are directed toward the spray tip discharge orifices 46.<br>
[0023]       In carrying out still a further feature of the invention, the ledge that defines the secondary impingement surface occupies the bottom most portion of the spray tip expansion chamber 42 so as to prevent the formation of a trough in the bottom of the spray tip that could accumulate liquid and cause drippage of liquid from the nozzle during spray operations. In this instance, the outer radial edge 51 of the secondary impingement surface 50 is defined by a cylindrical surface 52 in alignment with the inner radial edges of the spray tip discharge orifices 46 so that no<br><br>
trough or other liquid accumulating crevice can exist. Liquid particles atomized within and directed through the expansion chamber 42 of the spray tip 21 are forced to continue their movement to and through the discharge orifices 46, without agglomeration and accumulation within any liquid containing crevices of the spray tip.<br>
[0024]       From the foregoing, it can be seen that the spray nozzle assembly of the present invention is adapted for more efficiently generating and directing finely atomized discharging sprays. The subject spray nozzle assembly can be operated with smaller pressurized air generating equipment, while effecting a high-volume of more finely atomized, discharging liquid spray.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
