				<td>BLOW MOLDABLE POLYIMIDE/POLYAMIDE COMPOSITION, PROCESS FOR BLOW MOLDING AND ARTICLES MADE THEREBY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] Disclosed herein are compositions comprising polyimides and polyamides useful for blow molding. Also disclosed are processes for the making of blow molded articles.<br>
[0002] Blends of polyimide resins and polyamide resins possess various useful properties and are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,013,799 and 4,657,987 and European Patent No. 0 104 659 Bl. These polymer blends afford combined performance features not generally observed in the individual resins. The polyamide resin (also known as nylon resin) improves polyimide processability and solvent resistance while the polyimide resin improves the dimensional stability of the polyamide. While polyimide/polyamide blends have many useful features, they are difficult to melt process into large parts by blow molding techniques. Accordingly, there is a need for polyimide/polyamide blends useful in blow molding.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Polyimide/polyamide blends have been difficult to process into large parts by blow molding because their melt viscosity and melt elasticity are low. The low melt viscosity and low melt elasticity are especially notable at the high temperatures, often greater than 300 °C, needed to plasticize the polyimide and melt crystalline polyamide resins. It is now possible to make compositions having suitable melt viscosities for blow molding processes. More particularly, we have unexpectedly found that the use of mono functional or difunctional organo phosphorus compounds results in polyimide/polyamide blends having high melt elasticity and high melt viscosity suitable for blow molding into shaped articles with uniform wall thickness, having high heat resistance, high impact strength, and high tensile strength.<br>

radian per second to a melt viscosity at 100 radians per second (rad/sec), of 4.0 to 16.0, at 330 °C; a reverse notched Izod impact strength of greater than or equal to 250 Joules per meter (J/m), and a heat distortion temperature (HDT), measured at 66 pounds per square inch (psi) (0.45 MPa), of greater than or equal to 175 °C; and further wherein weight percent is based on the combined weight of polyimide and polyamide.<br>
[0005] In an embodiment, a thermoplastic composition comprises:<br>

c)	0.1 to 2.0 weight percent of an organo phosphorus compound having a molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500 grams per mole;<br>
d)	an additive comprising an alkali metal iodide, a copper salt, a hindered phenol compound, or a combination comprising two or more of the foregoing,<br>
wherein the composition has a ratio of melt viscosity at a shear rate of 1 radian per second to a melt viscosity at 100 radians per second (rad/sec), of 4.0 to 12.0, at 330 °C; a reverse notched Izod impact strength of greater than or equal to 250 Joules per meter (J/m), and a heat distortion temperature, measured at 66 psi (0.45 MPa), of greater than or equal to 190 °C; and<br>

c)	5 to 30 weight percent of glass fiber having an average fiber diameter of 5 to 20 micrometers;<br>
d)	0.1 to 2.0 weight percent of an organo phosphorus compound having a molecular weight of greater than or equal to 500 grams per mole; wherein the composition has a ratio of melt viscosity at a shear rate of 1 radian<br>
per second to a melt viscosity at 100 radians per second (rad/sec), of 4.0 to 12.0, at 330 °C; a reverse notched Izod impact strength of greater than or equal to 250 Joules per meter (J/m), and a heat distortion temperature, measured at 66 psi (0.45 MPa), of greater than or equal to 190°C; and<br>

[0008] Also disclosed herein are articles made using the method described above.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] As mentioned above, the melt elasticity of a composition is important physical property for blow molding, particularly for blow molding large parts. Melt elasticity can be measured by several methods, one example is by comparing the melt<br>
viscosity of a polymer blend at a low shear rate, for instance 1 radian/sec (rad/sec), to the viscosity at a higher shear rate, for example 100 rad/sec. In a resin with high melt elasticity, or high melt strength, there will be a large decrease in viscosity going from lower to higher shear rate. This behavior is sometimes called shear thinning. In resins with poor melt strength there will be a smaller decrease in viscosity versus shear rate. Resins with a small decrease in viscosity versus shear rate are often referred to as having Newtonian behavior. Resins with a larger decrease in viscosity versus shear rate are often referred to as having non-Newtonian behavior. Resins with non-Newtonian behavior are more useful for melt processing involving blow molding. In blow molding it is desirable to have resin that will flow through a narrow orifice, (a high shear situation) but will have sufficient melt strength (or melt elasticity) such that after passing through the orifice the molten polymer will support its own weight without excessive sagging (a low shear condition). If the resin can support its own weight after passing through the orifice it will produce an annular tube that will show little sagging and will have a more uniform wall thickness; such an annular tube can be shaped into a blow molded article. As parts get larger, for example, weighing greater than or equal to 100 grams (g), or greater than or equal to 1000 g, the need for high melt strength is even more important as the molten polymer must support more weight. Thus there are special rheological needs for blow molding large parts.<br>
[0010] In some embodiments the ratio of melt viscosity at 1 rad/sec to melt viscosity at 100 rad/sec is 4.0 to 16.0 at 330 °C for large part blow molding. In some embodiments the melt viscosity ratio is 4.0 to 12.0, or, more specifically, 4.5 to 10.0.<br>
[0011] Melt viscosity is effected by temperature as well as shear rate. In most instances (for thermoplastic resin compositions) viscosity decreases sharply as temperature is increased. Due to their high glass transition temperature (Tg), often greater than 200 °C, polyimide resins require very high melt processing temperatures, often 100, 125 or 150.°C above the polyimide Tg. At this high melt processing temperature (300 to 400 °C for example) polyamides, such as nylon 6 or nylon 6,6, have very low melt viscosity. Independent of the ratio of melt viscosity at low and high shear rates the thermoplastic composition also needs to have sufficiently high<br>
melt viscosity for blow molding. In some embodiments the thermoplastic composition has a melt viscosity at 100 rad/sec and 330 °C of 2,000 to 60,000 poise (P), or, more specifically, 2,000 to 30,000 P at 330 °C, or, more specifically, 3,000 to 20,000 P at 330°C. If the polyimide Tg is too high, for example greater than or equal to 310 °C, the blend may require a melt processing temperature that is too high, for example greater than 450 °C, resulting in decomposition of the polymers and additives in the composition.<br>
[0012] The terms "first," "second," and the like, "primary," "secondary," and the like, "(a)," "(b)" and the like, as used herein do not denote any order, quantity, or importance, but rather are used to distinguish one element from another. The terms "a" and "an" do not denote a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item. "Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event occurs and instances where it does not. The endpoints of all ranges directed to the same component or property are inclusive of the endpoint and independently combinable. Reference throughout the specification to "one embodiment," "another embodiment," "an embodiment," "some embodiments," and so forth, means that a particular element (e.g., feature, structure, property, and/or characteristic) described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment described herein, and may or may not be present in other embodiments. In addition, it is to be understood that the described element(s) may be combined in any suitable manner in the various embodiments.<br>
[0013] Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. For example, any position not substituted by any indicated group is understood to have its valency filled by a bond as indicated, or a hydrogen atom. A dash ("-") that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, -CHO is attached through carbon of the carbonyl radical.<br>
[0014] The term "alkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals having the specified number of carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-<br>
propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, s-pentyl, n- and s-hexyl, n-and s-heptyl, and, n- and s-octyl.<br>
[0015] The term "alkenyl" is defined as a branched or straight-chain unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having one or more double bonds between two or more carbon atoms. Examples of alkenyl radicals include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, heptenyl, octenyl and nonenyl and the corresponding C2-10 dienes, trienes and quadenes.<br>
[0016] The term "substituted" means that one or more hydrogens on the molecule, portion of the molecule, or atom are replaced with substitution groups provided that an atom's normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Such "substitution groups" may be selected from the group consisting of:, -OR, -NRH, , -C(O)R, -SR, -halo, -CN, -NO2, -SO2, phosphoryl, imino, thioester, carbocyclic, aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, bicyclic and tricyclic groups. When a substitution group is a keto (i.e., =O) group, then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. The terms R and R' refer to alkyl radicals that may be the same or different.<br>
[0017] The description is intended to include all permutations and combinations of the substitution groups as described by the formulas herein with the proviso that each permutation or combination can be selected by specifying the appropriate variable or substitution groups.<br>
[0018] Thus, for example, the term "substituted C1-10 alkyl " refers to alkyl moieties containing saturated bonds and having one or more hydrogens replaced by, for example, halogen, carbonyl, alkoxy, ester, ether, cyano, phosphoryl, imino, , alkylthio, thioester, sulfonyl, nitro, heterocyclo, aryl, or heteroaryl.<br>
[0019] The terms "halo", "halide" or "halogen" as used herein refer to fluoro, fluoride, chloro, chloride, bromo, bromide, iodo or iodide as appropriate in context.<br>
[0020] The term "monocyclic" as used herein refers to groups comprising a single ring system. The ring system may be aromatic, heterocyclic, aromatic heterocyclic, a saturated cycloalkyl, or an unsaturated cycloalkyl. The monocyclic group may be substituted or unsubstituted. Monocyclic alkyl groups may have 5 to 12 ring members.<br>
[0021] The term "polycyclic" as used herein refers to groups comprising multiple ring systems. The rings may be fused or unfused. The polycyclic group may be aromatic, heterocyclic, aromatic heterocyclic, a saturated cycloalkyl, an unsaturated cycloalkyl, or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. The polycyclic group may be substituted or unsubstituted. Polycyclic groups may have 6 to 20 ring members.<br>
[0022] The term "independently selected from", "independently, at each occurrence" or similar language, means that the labeled R substitution groups may appear more than once and may be the same or different when appearing multiple times in the same structure. Thus the R1 may be the same or different than the R6 and if the labeled R6 substitution group appears four times in a given permutation of Formula I, then each of those labeled R6 substitution groups may be, for example, a different alkyl group falling within the definition of R6.<br>
[0023] Other than in operating examples or where otherwise indicated, all numbers or expressions referring to quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and the like, used in the specification and claims are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about." Various numerical ranges are disclosed in this patent application. Because these ranges are continuous, they include every value between the minimum and maximum values. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, the various numerical ranges specified in this application are approximations.<br>

[0038] Polyamide resins, also known as nylons, are characterized by the presence of an amide group (-C(O)NH-), and are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,970,272 and 4,873,286.

[0060] When present glass fiber can be a boro silicate "E" glass or equivalent. The average fiber diameter can be 5 to 20 micrometers, or, more specifically, 10 to 17 micrometers. Glass fiber can be present in an amount up to 50 wt%, or, more specifically, 5 to 30 wt% based on the combined weight of polyimide and polyamide. Fiber filled blends can have a flexural modulus of 4,000 to 8,000 megaPascals (MPa) and a flexural strength of 150 to 250 MPa. In some embodiments comprising glass fiber, titanium dioxide, if present, is present in an amount less than or equal to 0.2 wt%, based on the combined weight of polyimide and polyamide. The high Mohs hardness (5.5 to 6.5) of the titanium dioxide can result in glass fiber breakage during compounding and melt processing giving reduced impact, tensile and flexural strength in the composition. In some embodiments, when glass fibers are present in the composition, fillers or colorants with a Mohs hardness of less than 4.0 are used.<br>
[0061] The thermoplastic composition can have an HDT at 66 psi (1.8 MPa) of greater than or equal to 175 °C as measured on a molded part 15.2 cm x 1.27 cm x 0.32 according to ASTM D648. In some embodiments the composition has an HDT at 66 psi (1.8 MPa) greater than or equal to 190 °C, or, more specifically, 175 to 250 °C.<br>
[0062] The composition can have a reverse notched (RN) Izod impact strength, as measured according to ASTM D256 on 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) thick molded parts, of greater than or equal to 250 J/m, or, more specifically, 300 to 1000 J/m.<br>
[0063] The compositions can be prepared by mechanically melt blending the components in conventional mixing equipment, e.g., a single or twin screw extruder, Banbury mixer, or any other conventional melt blending equipment. A vacuum may also be applied to during the melt blending operation to reduce volatile materials in the compositions.<br>
[0064] The compositions can be formed into shaped articles by blow molding. The blow molding process may use any conventional blow molding equipment capable of handling high melt temperatures. The composition may be dried to a moisture content less than or equal to 150 ppm, or, more specifically, less than or equal to 100 ppm. Drying can be achieved using numerous commercial drying devices. An exemplary device is a dehumidifying dryer. When the composition is dried in the presence of oxygen it can be desirable to dry the composition at a temperature sufficiently low to prevent yellowing of the composition.<br>
[0065] The composition can be melted using, for example, a screw device at 270 to 370 °C. The molten composition can then be pushed through an orifice or die to crate an annular tube with a wall thickness of 1 to 15 mm, or, more specifically, 2 to 15, or, even more specifically, 3 to 10 mm. In some embodiments the minimum outer diameter of the extruded annular tube, as it leaves the orifice, is 2 to 100 centimeters (cm). The continuous annular tube can be extruded to a length of greater than or equal to 5 cm, and in some embodiments up to 200 cm.<br>
[0066] The annular tube can then be closed off, for instance using a mechanical pinching device, to seal the tube at one end. Air or another gas such as nitrogen can be introduced into the molten polymer tube under pressure (for example 1 to 50 psi (0.007 to 0.34 MPa)) to expand the tube. In other instances suction can be used to expand the molten polymer tube. If desired a mold can encase the tube to give a desired shape. The expansion of the molten tube from its extruded form to its expanded blow molded shape should result in a minimum outer diameter of greater than or equal to 1.3 times that of the molten extruded tube. In some embodiments the expansion ratio will be 1.4 to 3.0, or, more specifically, 1.5 to 2.5. If a crystalline polyamide in used in the composition the expansion of the tube should be accomplished while the melt temperature is above the polyamide crystallization temperature (Tc).<br>
[0067] The blow molded article can then be cooled after or during expansion. If a crystalline resin is used as a major component of the composition cooling can be continued to a temperature less than or equal to (Tc-10°C). If the composition<br>
comprises predominately amorphous resins cooling can be continued to a temperature less than or equal to (Tg of the majority resin -10 °C). Majority resin is defined as the polymer present in the greatest amount based on the total weight of the composition. The article can then be removed by opening the mold. Any excess composition, for example, caused by closing of the mold may be trimmed from the article. Such excess composition can be ground up and reused in the process. Often such excess composition may be mixed in an amount of 1 to 40 wt% with composition that has not been blow molded.<br>
[0068] In some embodiments the wall thickness of the cooled article will be at least 1 mm but less than 15 mm. The wall thickness of the final part can be 1 to 15 mm, or, more specifically, 2 to 15 mm. In some embodiments there is less than 20% variation in wall thickness comparing the thinnest wall section to the thickest wall section in the article. In some embodiments the wall thickness will be 3 to 10 mm with less than a 20% variation in wall thickness. The minimum diameter, or smallest cross section, of the final part can be 2 to 100 cm.<br>
[0069] Large blow molded articles made from the composition can have a minimum outer diameter of greater than or equal to 2 cm. In some embodiments the minimum outer diameter is 2 to 50 cm. In some embodiments the article can be longer than 5 cm, or, more specifically, 5 to 200 cm in its longest aspect. The blow molded article can weigh 50 to 5,000 grams, or, more specifically, the blow molded article can weigh 500 to 5,000 grams.<br>
[0070] Articles can be tubes, ducts, hoses, pipes, connectors, conduits, enclosures for electrical equipment, parts of air handling systems, parts of motors, compressors, mufflers, parts of heating systems, kettles, carafes, bottles, jars, reservoirs, fuel or oil tanks and the like. Parts can also have several different layers of materials.<br>

Techniques and Procedures<br>
[0081] Blends were prepared by extrusion of mixtures of the polyamide 6, polyetherimide and other ingredients as indicated in the Tables on a 2.5 inch (63.5 mm) single-screw vacuum vented extruder. Compositions are listed in wt% of the total composition. The extruder was set at about 305 to 320 °C. The blends were run at about 55 to 145 rotations per minute (rpm) under vacuum using a mild mixing screw, vacuum was approximately 20 inches (508 mm) Hg. The extrudate was cooled, pelletized and dried at 95 °C. Test samples were injection molded at a set temperature of 305 to 320 °C and mold temperature of 120 °C, screw speed approximately 60 rpm, 50 psi (0.344 MPa) back pressure using a 30 second cycle time.<br>
[0082] Some properties were measured using ASTM test methods. All samples were conditioned for at least 48 hours at 50% relative humidity prior to testing. Heat distortion temperature (HDT) was measured at 66 psi (0.45 MPa) and 264 psi (1.82 MPa) on 3.2 mm thick bars as per ASTM D648. Tensile properties were measured on 3.2 mm type I bars as per ASTM method D638, cross head speed was 50 mm/min. Tensile modulus (T. Mod) was measured as tangent, tensile strength (T. Str) was measured at yield. Flexural modulus (F. Mod) and fiexural strength (F. Str) were measured as per ASTM method D790 on 3.2 mm bars. Izod impact strength; notched (N) and reverse notched (RN), were measured as per ASTM method D 256 using a 5 pound (2.2 kilogram) hammer on 3.2 mm bars. Melt viscosity (Vise) was measured in poise (P) at 330 °C and viscosities versus shear rate (radian /sec.) were measured at 330 °C on an ARES brand strain controlled parallel plate rheometer, from TA Instruments, as per ASTM method D4440. Pellet samples were dried for greater than or equal to 4 hours at 95 °C prior to testing. The parallel plate gap was set at 1.0 mm, strain was 20%. Samples were preheated for 6 minutes before recording data. Viscosity was recorded from 0.5 to 500 radians/sec. The viscosity ratio at low shear (1 rad/sec.) and high shear (100 rad/sec.) at 330 °C were recorded and the ratio of low to high shear viscosity calculated. DSC was done with a heating rate of 20 °C/min; Tm (melting temperature) and heat of fusion/ melting was recorded on the second heat, Tc (crystallization temperature) and heat of crystallization was recorded on the first cooling cycle.<br>

Results<br>
[0084] Table 1 shows the properties of various 15 wt% glass filled blends of about 45 wt% PEI and 40 wt% polyamide 6 with an added phosphorus containing compound, (Phos 1 = PEPQ). The blends have high flexural strength (&gt;180 MPa) and high heat distortion (66 psi HDT &gt; 190 °C). Note the improvement in RN Izod (&gt;350 J/m) values for examples 1 to 5 versus control A. The control blend A, with no added phosphorus compound, has low melt strength at 330 °C as shown by the ratio of low shear (1 rad/sec) to high shear (100 rad/ sec) viscosity (3.60) and cannot consistently be blow molded into large (for example &gt; 30 mm diameter) ductwork, or tubes, of uniform wall thickness. This low viscosity ratio (less than 4.0) indicates that the resin will not show high melt elasticity and will have limited use in blow molding processes. However addition of even a low level (0.2 wt%) of Phos 1 brings a sharp increase in melt viscosity raising the melt viscosity at 100 rad/sec at 330 C to above 3000 poise, as well as raising the low to high shear viscosity ratio. This viscosity ratio is increased to &gt;6 and in most cases over 8. This high melt strength gives a more elastic composition with easier melt forming by processes such a blow molding. Such blow molded articles will have high heat resistance and high stiffness and strength, with good practical impact.<br>

[0085] Figure 1 shows the increase in the ratio of the low to high shear viscosity at 330 °C of a Example A and Examples 1 to 5 as a function of added phosphorus compound.<br>
[0086] Table 2 shows the effectiveness of phosphorus compounds 2 and 3 at improving the melt strength of a GF-PEI-PA6 blend. Phos 2 and 3 used in examples 6 and 7 are phosphites that are also effective in improving melt viscosity and increasing melt strength (the low to high shear melt viscosity ratio). Surprisingly the mono phosphorus compound (Phos 3, example 7), having only one phosphorus atom in its molecular structure, increases the melt viscosity and the melt viscosity ratio at a value comparable to Phos 1 (example 2) and Phos 2 (example 6) which have two phosphorus atoms in their chemical structure.<br>

Example 8 has added heat stabilizers: cuprous iodide (Cul), added at 0.05 wt%, and 0.3 wt% potassium iodide (KI). Potassium iodide was added as a 33% aqueous solution in deionized water to help dispersion. Cul was added as a fine powder. Example 9 additionally had a hindered phenol as an antioxidant. Note that neither of the three antioxidants, Cul, KI or hindered phenol, has a detrimental effect on the increased melt viscosity and the high melt viscosity ratio achieved by addition of 0.4 wt% Phos 1. The HDT (66 psi) was above 200 °C, flex modulus and flex strength remained high; greater than 5,000 MPa and greater than 190 MPa respectively.<br>

[0088] Table 4 shows the additional examples using phos 1 in the composition. Example 10 is a replicate of example 1, again showing high melt strength and good thermal and mechanical properties. Example 11 shows that at higher PEI content and lower PA6 content, Phos 1 is still effective at increasing melt strength and melt viscosity ratio over a control B with no added phosphorus compound.<br>

[0089] Table 5 (examples 12 and 13) shows the fiber glass is not essential to the increase in melt viscosity and the increase in 1 to 100 (rad/sec.) melt viscosity ratio achieved by addition of 0.2 wt% of Phos 1. Note the low 1 to 100 rad/sec viscosity ratio (3.89) in the blend (C) with no added phosphorus compound is increased to 8.00 in example 12.<br>

[0090] Table 6 shows the effectiveness of organo phosphorus compounds Phos 4 and Phos 5, which are phosphates containing two phosphorus atoms per molecule and having a molecular weight above 500, at improving the melt strength of a GF-PEI-PA6 blend. Phos 4 and 5 used in examples 14 and 15 are phosphates that improve melt viscosity and increasing melt strength (the low to high shear melt viscosity ratio). In example 14 using 0.4 wt% of (resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) (Phos 4) the low to high shear viscosity ratio at 330 °C is increased to 8.77 when compared to Example A. In example 15 using 0.4 wt% bisphenol-A bis(diphenyl phosphate) (Phos 5) the low to high shear viscosity ratio is increase to 9.75 when compared to Example A.<br>
