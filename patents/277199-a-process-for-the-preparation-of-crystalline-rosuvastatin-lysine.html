Solubility and stability are important characteristic of a salt form that can affect its suitability for use as a drug. Where aqueous solubility is low, i.e. less than 10 mg/ml, the dissolution rate at in vivo administration can be rate limiting in the absorption process leading to poor bioavailability. Therefore, poorly soluble drug substance requires special efforts in formulation development to achieve desired results. The stability of drug product is important parameter for its pharmaceutical use.<br>
Although rosuvastatin calcium provides good pharmaceutical activity, it would be beneficial to find other forms of rosuvastatin;  in particular, rosuvastatin salts having advantageous properties for pharmaceutical use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

In general, the solution of rosuvastatin salts may be obtained by dissolving rosuvastatin acid or its alkaline salt in one or more solvent and treating with suitable organic amine as disclosed herein above in one or more of suitable solvent. The solution may be obtained by heating the rosuvastatin salt in a solvent.

Thus, the advantage of the present invention is to provide at least chemically stable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of rosuvastatin which doesn't degrade to impurities.<br>
When a molecule or other material is identified herein as "substantially free", it generally means, unless specified otherwise, that the material is about 99% pure or more. In general, this refers to purity with regard to unwanted residual solvents, reaction byproducts, impurities and unreacted starting materials.<br>

In particular, rosuvastatin alkali or alkaline salts may be converted to rosuvastatin acid before contacting with lysine.<br>
In general, the reaction may be carried out in one or more of suitable solvents. The solvent system is particularly selected so as to facilitate the salt formation reaction and to allow subsequent separation of the resulting material. Advantageously, both rosuvastatin and the lysine are dissolvable, at least partly, in the solvent system, at least at elevated temperatures.

In general, the rosuvastatin or its alkali or alkaline salt comprises of rosuvastatin acid or rosuvastatin alkali or alkaline salt selected from sodium, potassium, lithium, barium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and zinc. In particular, rosuvastatin alkali or alkaline salts may be converted to rosuvastatin acid before contacting with ethanolamine.<br>
In general, the reaction may be carried out in one or more of suitable solvents. The solvent system is particularly selected so as to facilitate the salt formation reaction and to allow subsequent separation of the resulting material. Advantageously, both rosuvastatin and the ethanolamine are dissolvable, at least partly, in the solvent system, at least at elevated<br>
 <br>
temperatures. In the process, a mixture, slurry, or solution of rosuvastatin or its alkali or alkaline salt and a solvent may be contacted with ethanolamine or conversely, a mixture or solution of ethanolamine and a solvent may be contacted with rosuvastatin or its alkali or alkaline salt.<br>
In general, the ethanolamine may be monoethanolamine or its anhydrous or hydrate form. In particular, it may be monoethanolamine.<br>
In further embodiments of the process, both may be combined with a solvent system prior to being contacted together, whereby the solvent system used for ethanolamine may be identical with or different from the solvent system used for the rosuvastatin or its alkali or alkaline salt. The solvent system can be comprised of a single solvent or a mixture of solvents. When two or more solvents are used, a two phase reaction scheme may be used wherein the rosuvastatin or its alkali or alkaline salt and ethanolamine are primarily reacted in one phase and the resulting rosuvastatin ethanolamine is primarily present in the other phase due to, inter alia, solubility differences, etc. Suitable solvent comprises one or more of C1-C6 alcohols; esters; ketones; hydrocarbons; halogenated hydrocarbons and polar aprotic solvents. In general, suitable solvent comprises one or more of water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, propanol, butanol, isobutanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, dimethyl form amide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, methylene dichloride, chlorobenzene, acetonitrile and the like.<br>
In general, the temperature of contact of rosuvastatin or its alkali or alkaline salt and ethanolamine in the solvent system is from ambient to the boiling point of the solvent system, with elevated temperatures, but generally less than the boiling point, being preferred.

The embodiment of the process includes isolation or recovery of crystalline rosuvastatin ethanolamine from the salt forming reaction by any convenient means.

Alternatively, precipitation can be induced by reducing the temperature of the<br>
 <br>
solvent, especially if the initial temperature at contact is elevated. The precipitation may also be facilitated by reducing the volume of the solution/solvent or by adding a contra solvent, i.e. a liquid miscible with the solvent in which the rosuvastatin ethanolamine is less soluble. Seed crystals of rosuvastatin ethanolamine may also be added to help induce precipitation. The crystalline rosuvastatin ethanolamine may be isolated by conventional methods such as filtration or centrifugation, optionally washed and dried, preferably under diminished pressure.<br>
