				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Novel Spiro Compounds<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is useful in medical fields.<br>
In more detail, novel spiro compounds of this invention are<br>
useful as neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists and as agents<br>
for the treatment of various kinds of cardiovascular<br>
disorders, central nervous system disorders, metabolic<br>
diseases, and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Neuropeptide Y (hereinafter referred to as NPY), a<br>
peptide consisting of 36 amino acids, was first isolated from<br>
porcine brain by Tatemoto et al. in 1982 [Nature, 296: 659<br>
(1982)]. NPY is widely distributed in central nervous<br>
system and peripheral nervous system and plays various roles<br>
as one of the most abundant peptide in the nervous system.<br>
That is, NPY acts as an orexigenic substance in the central<br>
nervous system and markedly promotes fat accumulation via<br>
the mediation of the secretion of various hormones or the<br>
action of the nervous system. It is known that the-<br>
continuous intracerebroventricular administration of NPY<br>
induces obesity and insulin resistance based on these<br>
actions (International Journal of Obesity, vol.19: 517<br>
(1995); Endocrinology, vol.133: 1753 (1993)). It is also<br>
known that NPY has central effects, such as depression,<br>
anxiety, schizophrenia, pain, dementia and the like (Drugs,<br>
vol. 52, 371(1996). Further, in the periphery, NPY coexists<br>
with norepinephrine in sympathetic ending and is involved<br>
in the tonicity of the sympathetic nervous system. It is<br>
known that peripheral administration of NPY causes<br>
vasoconstriction and enhances the activities of other<br>
vasoconstrictive substances such as norepinephrine (British<br>
Journal of Pharmacology, vol.95: 419 (1988)). It is also<br>
reported that NPY could participate in the development of<br>
cardiac hypertrophy as a result of the sympathic stimulation<br>
(Proceeding National Academic Science USA, Vol. 97,<br>
1595(2000)).<br>
On the other hand, it is reported that NPY is also<br>
involved in the secretory function of sexual hormones and<br>
growth hormone, sexual behavior and reproductive function,<br>
gastro-intestinal motility, bronchoconstriction,<br>
inflammation and alcohol preference (Life Science, vol. 55,<br>
551(1994); The Journal of Allergy and Immunology, vol. 101,<br>
S345(1998); Nature, vol. 396, 366(1998)).<br>
NPY has a variety of pharmacological effects which<br>
result from NPY binding to the NPY receptors. Other NPY<br>
related peptides, including peptide YY and pancreatic<br>
polypeptide also bind to the NPY receptors. It is known<br>
that these pharmacological effects are mediated by the<br>
action of, at least, five receptor subtypes with or without<br>
synergistic interactions. (Trends in Neuroscience, vol. 20,<br>
294(1997)).<br>
Y1: It is reported that the central effect mediated by NPY<br>
Y1 receptor includes the remarkable orexigenic effect<br>
(Endocrinology, vol. 137, 3177(1996); Endocrinology, vol.<br>
141, 1011(2000)). Further, the Y1 receptor is reported to<br>
be involved in anxiety and pain (Nature, vol. 259, 528(1993);<br>
Brain Research, vol. 859, 361(2000)). In addition, the<br>
pressor effects mediated by the strong action of<br>
vasoconstriction in the periphery by NPY is also reported<br>
to be mediated by Y1 (FEBS Letters, vol. 362, 192(1995);<br>
Nature Medicine, vol. 4, 722(1998)).<br>
Y2: It is known that the inhibitory effect on the release<br>
of various neurotransmitters in the sympathetic nerve<br>
endings is mediated by the NPY Y2 receptor (British Journal<br>
of Pharmacology, vol. 102, 41(1991); Synapse, vol. 2,<br>
299(1988) ). In periphery, NPY causes constriction of blood<br>
vessel or vas def erens directly or via the control of release<br>
of various neurotransmitters (The Journal of Pharmacology<br>
and Experimental Therapeutics, vol. 261, 863(1992); British<br>
Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 100, 190(1990)). In addition,<br>
inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissues is known<br>
(Endocrinology, vol. 131, 1970(1992)). Further, the<br>
inhibition of ion secretion in the gastro-intestinal tract<br>
is reported (British Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 101<br>
247(1990) ).<br>
On the other hand, the inhibitory effect on the central<br>
nervous system functions such as memory and anxiety is also<br>
reported (Brain Research, vol. 503, 73(1989); Peptides, vol.<br>
19, 359(1998)).<br>
Y3: It is reported that NPY Y3 receptor is mainly located<br>
at brainstem and in the heart and is related to regulation<br>
of blood pressure and heart rate (The Journal of Pharmacology<br>
and Experimental Therapeutics, vol. 258, 633(1991);<br>
Peptides, vol. 11, 545(1990)). Further, it is known that<br>
the Y3 receptor is involved in the control of catecholamine<br>
secretion in adrenal gland ( (The Journal of Pharmacology and<br>
Experimental Therapeutics, vol. 244, 468(1988); Life<br>
Science, vol. 50, PL7(1992)).<br>
Y4: NPY Y4 receptor has high affinity for pancreatic<br>
polypeptide. The related pharmacological effects reported<br>
to be mediated by the Y4 receptor include the inhibition of<br>
pancreatic secretion and the gastro-intestinal motility<br>
(Gastroenterology, vol.85, 1411(1983)). Further, it is<br>
reported that NPY enhances the secretion of the sexual<br>
hormone in the central nervous system (Endocrinology, vol.<br>
140, 5171(1999)).<br>
Y5: The effect mediated by NPY Y5 receptor includes feeding<br>
stimulation and accumulation of fat: (Nature, vol. 382,<br>
168(1996)); American Journal of Physiology, vol. 277,<br>
R1428(1999) ). It is reported that the NPY Y5 receptor also<br>
mediates some CNS effects, such as seizure and epilepsy, or<br>
pain and the morphine withdrawal symptoms (Natural Medicine,<br>
vol. 3, 761(1997); Proceeding Academic Science USA, vol. 96,<br>
13518(1999); The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental<br>
Therapetlcs, vol. 284, 633(1998)). In the periphery, the<br>
Y5 receptor is reported to be involved in diuresis and<br>
hypoglicemic effect caused by NPY (British Journal of<br>
Pharmacology, vol. 120, 1335(1998); Endocrinology, vol. 139,<br>
3018(1998)). NPY is also reported to enhance cardiac<br>
hypertrophy as a result of the sympathic accentuation<br>
(Proceeding National Academic Science USA, Vol. 97,<br>
1595(2000) ).<br>
The effects of NPY occur by binding to the NPY<br>
receptors in the central or peripheral nervous system.<br>
Therefore, the action of NPY can be prevented by blocking<br>
the binding to NPY receptors. Substances antagonize NPY<br>
binding to NPY receptors may be useful for the prophylaxis<br>
or treatment of various diseases related to NPY, such as<br>
cardiovascular disorders (for example hypertension,<br>
nephropathy, heart disease, vasospasm), central nervous<br>
system disorders (for example bulimia, depression, anxiety,<br>
seizure, epilepsy, dementia, pain, alcoholism, drug<br>
withdrawal), metabolic diseases (for example obesity,<br>
diabetes, hormone abnormality), sexual and reproductive<br>
dysfunction, gastro-intestinal motility disorder,<br>
respiratory disorder, inflammation or glaucoma and the like<br>
(Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 15: 153 (1994); Life<br>
Science,. 55, 551(1994); Drugs, vol. 52, 371(1996); The<br>
Journal of Allergy and Immunology, vol. 101, S345(1998);<br>
Nature, vol. 396, 366(1998); The Journal of Pharmacology and<br>
Experimental Therapeutics, vol. 284, 633(1998); Trends in<br>
Pharmacological Science, vol. 20, 104(1999); Proceeding<br>
National Academic Science USA, vol. 97, 1595(2000)).<br>
Recently, according to the investigation of the<br>
present inventors, it has been found that some kind of NPY<br>
receptor antagonist is useful in the prophylaxis or<br>
treatment of hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia and<br>
arteriosclerosis [International application publication<br>
WO99/27965].<br>

The reaction between a compound of the general formula<br>
(II) and a compound of the general formula (III) is usually<br>
carried out by employing an equivalent to excessive mole,<br>
preferably an equivalent to 1. 5 moles of compound (III) based<br>
on 1 mole of compound (II).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in an inert solvent,<br>
and as the inert solvent, made is use of, for example,<br>
methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or the mixture, and<br>
the like, preferably.<br>
The aforesaid reaction may be preferably carried out<br>
in the presence of base, including organic bases (for example<br>
triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine) or inorganic bases (for example<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide), and the like.<br>
The amount of the aforesaid base employed is usually<br>
an equivalent to excessive mole, preferably 1 to 5 moles<br>
based on 1 mole of a compound of the general formula (II).<br>
Reaction temperature is usually-30 t to 200 oC,<br>
preferably 20oC to lOOoC.<br>
Reaction time is usually 5 minutes to 7 days,<br>
preferably 30 minutes to 24 hours.<br>
At the conclusion of the reaction, the crude product<br>
of a compound of the general formula (IV-1) can be obtained<br>
by usual treatment. Thus obtained compound (IV-1) is<br>
purified by the conventional method, or not purified, if<br>
necessary followed by optional combination of elimination<br>
reaction of amino-, hydroxy-, carboxyl-, oxo- and<br>
carbonyl-protecting group to give a compound of the general<br>
formula (1-1).<br>
The elimination of protecting groups may be carried<br>
out depending upon the kinds of the aforesaid protecting<br>
groups, the stability of a desired compound (1-1) and so on,<br>
for example, by the manner described in the literature<br>
[Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W.Greene, John<br>
