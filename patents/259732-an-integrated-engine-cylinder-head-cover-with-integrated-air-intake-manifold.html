Intake manifold of an IC engine is generally disposed between the intake port and the air-cleaner and the plenum volume acts as surge-tank to provide air to different cylinders with respect to valve-timing. The intake manifold has many branches (runner pipes) as the number of cylinders to distribute the air into the intake port.<br>
Engine also has valve cover, which is secured to the cylinder head by fasteners typically around the entire perimeter of valve cover to enclose the rocker arms and intake and exhaust valves to prevent debris entering the cylinder head and inhibiting its operation.<br>
The intake manifold and cylinder-head cover of prior art are manufactured and installed separately on base engine using many fasteners to cover rocker-arm, inlet/ exhaust valves, camshaft. It is desirable to provide intake manifold and cylinder-head cover as a single unit. So that conversion of diesel engine to run on gaseous fuel and adaptations of multi point gas injection system can be possible. It also desired being single unit without compromising the existing functionality and added features as well. The addition features could be able to accommodate fuel injection system, ignition system, Oil separator, Gasket &amp; etc. It is also desirable to use a minimal number of fasteners to speed assembly of the engine.   Therefore, what is<br><br><br>
needed is an intake manifold assembly and valve cover module for installation onto base engine assembly, which may be shipped as single unit and that can provide space for MpSgi (multi point sequential gas injection system) and spark plug and oil separator.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Main object of this invention is to provide an intake manifold apparatus and<br>

These cylinders have in-built High-Pressure Regulator (11). High pressure line (13) carries gases to electronics Low-Pressure Regulator (14), which converts high pressure to working level pressure. Low-pressure line (15) carries gases to common rail (16). The other end of common rail consist a low pressure sensor (31) to monitor the rail-pressure, injectors (44) are connected to common rail. Intake manifold (19) consists of plenum chamber (30), TMAP Sensor (24) and Electronically Controlled Throttle body (23). In the intake port (22), the Air is delivered to cylinder through intake valves, the valve Opening &amp; Closing controlled by a cam shaft. Slot (25) is provided on intake runner pipe (22) to accommodate injectors and ensuring the optimized angle of injection w.r.t air flow direction. The<br><br><br>
exhaust port (21) is provided with exhaust valve, the valve Opening &amp; Closing controlled by a cam.<br>
FIGURES 2 &amp; 3, show the embodiment according present invention. The integrated unit consist of plenum (30), intake runner (22), Rocker-arm chamber (19), threaded boss (52) for oil separator, slots (50) for spark plug. The intake manifold has an air distribution plenum (30), which is connected through intake runner (22) to each cylinder's intake-port. The combined length of intake runner and intake port is defined for Ram Effect for max torque output.<br>
The front side (air-entry) of plenum has flange (59) to accommodate the Electronically Controlled Throttle-body. Next to the ETC, another flange (58) is provided to allow the Exhaust Gas Re-circulation to meet Low-Nox emission by diluting the Intake air at desired ratio. This EGR entry position is decided based on better mixing/distribution of Exhaust with the Intake air to all cylinders. The plenum consists of a boss (60) to accommodate T-MAP sensor. Further it has two identical bosses (51) to accommodate Fuel-Rail. The tapered passages (54) are provided to assemble the said component on cylinder head through fasteners ensuring leak proof (Oil) fitment through the circumference. The next side of this component has curvature (50) and boss projection (61) to allow and hold the Sparkplug respectively to Cylinder head and cover. The ribs (55) are provided to distribute the tightening forces towards the circumference for leak-proof fitment as the fasteners are kept centre line of cylinder head.<br>
In an internal combustion engine, the crankcase needs to vent due to the flow of gases (blow-by) from combustion chamber past the piston ring into crankcase. To remove these gases, a threaded hole (52) provided on top on cover to accommodate oil separator. An oil separator for separating and collecting lubrication oil contained in blow-by gas of an internal combustion engine. The separator is formed in the cylinder-head cover of the engine and incorporates a porous filter or filters made of foam metal for absorbing oil constituents in the blow-by gas. The filter is vertically<br><br><br>
arranged so as to make the absorbed oil to fall to the bottom of the separator and to be collected by the oil reservoir for recycling the separated oil to the cylinder FIGURE 4 shows the cross-section view of arrangement of present invention with the related components fitted on Multi Cylinder Inline Engine. In preferred embodiment of present invention, in-line cylinders are formed in cylinder-block (36). The cylinder head (37) is secured to upper side of cylinder block (36) by set of cylinder-head bolts. Rocker cover and intake manifold unit, which surrounds and protect the engine valve assemblies and rocker arm mechanism. This is fastened to cylinder head (37) by thin &amp; longer bolts. A piston (41) is reciprocally supported in each cylinder (36). Each piston is connected by a connecting rod (not shown in figure) to a crankshaft (44) joumaled in conventional manner in lower portion of cylinder block (36). Fuel is combusted within the cylinders, which reciprocates the pistons. This reciprocating force acts on crankshaft (44), from which power transferred to vehicle. A single integrated intake manifold and cylinder-head cover, generally indicated at (19) is mounted to cylinder head (37). Intake port (38) connects intake runner (22) and cylinder (36). Intake valve (35) is placed in between cylinder and intake port to control the fluid flow and the valve Opening &amp; Closing controlled by cam shaft (43). Camshaft (43) driven by crankshaft (44) through timing gears (not shown in figure).<br>
To accommodate injectors (for multi-point sequential gas injection) steel insert (46) is kept during casting. These steel inserts give better surface finish than aluminum surface to ensure leak proof fitment of injectors on intake runner (22). The gaseous fuel is injected into the air, which is channeled from plenum (30) into each intake port of the cylinder (36). A fuel supply plenum (16) supplies fuel to the injectors. Injector (42) is disposed to intake runner through steel insert (46) Injecting fuel into the intake runner makes it possible to introduce a uniform concentrated mixture into the cylinder &amp; form homogenous mixture for proper combustion. The primary purpose of present invention is to provide a single unit instead of two separate units of intake manifold and cylinder head cover further added features to meet the Multi-<br><br><br>
Point Sequential Gas injection system, Blow-by separation, to hold High-Tension Coil-on-Plug. Casting of this intake manifold cum cylinder head cover is done as single unit from Aluminum. As working pressures and functionality of these two chambers (intake manifold &amp; cylinder head cover) are different, a wall (39) is provided to divide the chambers. So both chambers in single unit can function independently. To prevent blow-by, oil and air-fuel mixture leakage, a gasket (40) is fixed between cylinder head and stated unit.<br>
