Spray gun and process for application of actinic radiation-curable coating<br>
The current invention relates to a spray gun for application of a coating having a spray nozzle and at least one actinic radiation outlet, and to a process of applying a coating composition which is at least partly curable by actinic radiation.<br>
European Patent Application EP-A 1 002 587 discloses a UV light-assisted spray gun for paint application provided with one or more UV point sources located just next to the spray nozzle. The coating composition is irradiated immediately before or after leaving the spray gun. Cross-linking of a UV curable coating composition is initiated only right next to the spray nozzle. This requires an induction period between the initiation by UV light and the actual onset of the cross-linking reaction. This requirement undesirably limits the choice of radiation-curable coating compositions which can be applied with this spray gun. Because irradiation only occurs right next to the spray nozzle, the balance of flow of the coating material just after application and the drying speed will be affected negatively. This can detract from the appearance of top coats and from the adhesion of primers.<br>
Additionally, on the surface of the radiation outlet inside the spray gun there may be deposited a layer of cross-linked coating material which increases in thickness during operation. Said deposition limits the dose of radiation which remains available for initiation of the curing reaction. Ultimately, the deposition of cross-linked coating material inside the spray gun can lead to blocking. Also, blocking of the spray nozzle can occur if cross-linked material is formed and left in the spray gun. When the spraying process is interrupted, already irradiated coating material remains in the spray nozzle.<br>
Furthermore, insufficient or incomplete initiation of the curing reaction in the spray gun known from EP-A 1 002 587 can occur with coating<br><br>
coating composition, deposition of cross-linked material on the radiation outlet and the problems associated therewith will not be encountered. Furthermore, because the irradiation period is not limited to the moment immediately before or after the coating material leaves the spray gun, also coating compositions requiring a relatively high dose of actinic radiation for initiation can be cured completely and without delay. If required, additional irradiation of the coated surface can be carried out with the spray gun according to the invention without spraying of coating material.<br>
A further embodiment of the spray gun according to the invention is characterized in that the angle between the mean propagation direction of the actinic radiation and the mean flow direction of the coating in the nozzle is less than 90 degrees, preferably less than 45 degrees. In this geometry, an increased proportion of actinic radiation reaches the coated substrate during operation of the spray gun.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the spray gun the at least one actinic radiation outlet and the nozzle are mutually directable to allow overlap between actinic radiation and the spray nozzle spraying zone. By spray nozzle spraying zone is meant the space which is reached by the spray mist during operation of the spray gun. The geometry of this preferred embodiment ensures that during operation of the spray gun the spray mist and the freshly coated substrate are irradiated with actinic radiation.<br>
By actinic radiation is meant electromagnetic radiation capable of initiating a chemical reaction. The wavelength of the actinic radiation used in the spray gun according to the invention can be varied over a wide range. The wavelength suitable for particular cases depends on the coating system which is to be sprayed and cured with the spray gun. Generally, visible light and ultraviolet (UV) radiation have suitable wavelengths. Particularly suitable wavelengths of the actinic radiation are below 600 nm, in<br><br>
1,000 hours for conventional UV lamps. Further, UV-LEDs generally have a narrow wavelength distribution and offer the possibility to customize the peak Wavelength. UV-LEDs are characterized by an efficient conversion of electric energy to UV radiation. This causes low heat generation and allows the omission of cooling elements or the use of only small ones, which is beneficial for attachment to a spray gun. Another advantage of UV-LEDs is their relatively low working voltage, which is preferred in a paint spray booth environment compared to the higher voltages needed for normal UV lamps.<br>
A source of actinic radiation such as mentioned above can be mounted on the exterior of the spray gun according to the invention so as to direct the actinic radiation towards the spray mist and the coated substrate. Alternatively, the at least one actinic radiation outlet is connected to an actinic radiation source by a light guide. In this case the source of actinic radiation can be positioned away from the spray gun. Light guides are made of transparent material to guide a flow of light by use of total reflection. It is preferred that the light guide is made of flexible material so as to allow movement of the spray gun relative to the source of actinic radiation. Examples of materials for light guides are plastic, fiber light guides consisting of a number of thin light guide fibers, and liquid light guides.<br>
As mentioned above, the spray gun according to the invention has at least one actinic radiation outlet. However, it is also possible that the spray gun has a plurality of actinic radiation outlets, for example 2, 3, 4, or even more actinic radiation outlets. Individual UV-LEDs as mentioned above are often of a rather small size and emit a comparatively low level of actinic radiation. Consequently, if such UV-LEDs are used as a source of actinic radiation, it is preferred that a plurality of UV-LEDs is grouped together in a so-called UV-LED array. The number of individual UV-LEDs<br><br>
the coating in the nozzle, and the variation of the number of actinic radiation outlets. It is also possible to introduce suitable lenses and/or reflectors into the actinic radiation beam in order to control the distribution and the propagation direction of actinic radiation. Apertures, which may optionally be adjustable, can also be used to control the amount and the distribution ratio of actinic radiation. Combinations and variations of these embodiments are of course possible.<br>
There are no restrictions with respect to the type of spray gun which can be used according to the invention, as long the spray gun is suitable for spraying coating material. Preferred spray guns are spray guns for liquid coating compositions. Such spray guns are generally known to the skilled person and are described by Klaus Chor in Lehrbuch fQr Fahrzeuglackierer, Audin Verlag, Munich 1999, pp. 124 - 132. Examples of suitable spray guns include hand-held spray guns with gravity feed, suction feed, and pressure feed; high- and low-pressure air spray guns, and airless spray guns; multi-component spray guns, e.g. two-component spray guns; and spray guns for electrostatic spraying. Air spray guns are preferred.<br>
in one particular embodiment, the spray gun according to the invention forms part of an automated coating system, such as a coating robot In one embodiment the spray gun has means to start and stop spraying and irradiation with actinic radiation simultaneously, for example by including a switch for the actinic radiation source in the trigger of the spray gun. However, it is also advantageous if the actinic radiation can be started up separately, so as to have the possibility of additional irradiation of the coated substrate after spraying in order to increase the cure speed and/or to ensure complete curing of the coating.<br><br>
case, the thermal curing reaction may be the same as or different from the actinic radiation-induced curing reaction. Thus, the coating composition can also comprise groups which are not susceptible to actinic radiation-induced curing.<br>
The spray gun according to the invention can be employed with particular advantage in an embodiment of the above-mentioned process wherein the coating composition comprises a photolatent base and a base-catalyzed polymerizable or curable material. The curing reaction will start with little or no delay after the photolatent base has been transformed to a non-latent base by the action of actinic radiation. The advantages of the spray gun according to the invention over the known spray guns can thus be fully exploited.<br>
Examples of suitable photolatent bases are described in European Patent Application EP-A 0 882 072, in International Patent Application WO 94/28075, and in International Patent Application WO 01/92362. The photolatent base is preferably selected from a 4-(ortho-nitrophenyl) dihydropyridine, optionally substituted with alkyl ether and/or alkyl ester groups, a quaternary organo-boron photoinitiator, and an a-amino acetophenone. The preferred a-amino acetophenone is a compound according to the following formula (I):<br><br>
Mixtures comprising Michael donors, such as polyfunctional acetoacetates or malonates, and polyfunctional Michael acceptors, such as acryloyl-functional compounds, are suitable as base-catalyzed curable material.<br><br>
The invention will be elucidated further with reference to the drawing and to the following examples.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example of a spray gun (1) according to the invention. Two actinic radiation outlets (2) of two light guides (5) are positioned externally next to the spray nozzle (6). The actinic radiation outlets (2) and the spray nozzle (6) are directed to a substrate to be coated (4). The actinic radiation is directed towards the spray mist (3). The arrows (7) and (8) show the mean propagation direction of the actinic radiation and the mean flow direction of the coating in the nozzle, respectively. The spray gun (1) is a model GTI ex DeVilbiss. The light guides (5) are connected to a UV point source (not shown in Fig. 1).<br><br><br><br>
