				<td>Switch Cupboard with Devices for Cooling the Hot Air Inside<br>
The invention relates to a switchgear cabinet with devices<br>
for cooling the heated air being generated therein.<br>
Cooling devices, which can be installed on the top of the<br>
switchgear cabinet are known, which draw off the heated air from<br>
the interior of the switchgear cabinet and return it to the<br>
interior of the switchgear cabinet after it has been cooled.<br>
Heat exchangers designed as wall elements are known, which<br>
take over the same function.<br>
These known devices have the disadvantage that they cannot<br>
be adapted to various conditions in the interior of the switchgear<br>
cabinet. For example, there is the repeated desire to draw off<br>
the air in a specific manner from clearly defined locations in the<br>
interior, or to directly conduct the returned cooled air to<br>
components, which have been mounted at arbitrary locations of the<br>
interior.<br>
It is the object of the invention to design a switchgear<br>
cabinet with devices for cooling the heated air being generated in<br>
the interior thereof in such a way, that the air circulation in<br>
the interior can easily be adapted to various conditions.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is attained<br>
in that at least one vertical side is closed off with a double-<br>
walled wall element, whose outer and inner wall sections form an<br>
air conduit with a large surface, and that several openings are<br>
cut, distributed over the inner wall section, which can<br>
selectively be covered by cover plates, fans, which can be<br>
operated in both directions of rotation, and hose sections with<br>
connector plates.<br>
Depending on the covering of the openings, it is possible<br>
by means of the fans to draw off or blow in air at all these<br>
locations having openings. The same applies for the hose<br>
sections, which in this case can be brought to exactly defined<br>
components, which are arbitrarily distributed over the interior.<br>
Openings which are not used can be covered with the cover plates.<br>
Equipping the inner wall section as a part of the heat exchanger<br>
can be varied in many ways and optimally adapted to the conditions<br>
prevailing in the interior.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the openings<br>
have been distributed in a grid pattern in the inner wall section.<br>
In this connection it is possible to additionally provide that the<br>
inner wall section is put together from several vertically divided<br>
wall panels.<br>
An advantageous embodiment provides for the openings to<br>
have a square cross section.<br>
If fans are used, whose input and output connecting planes<br>
are at an acute angle in respect to each other, the "fans can be<br>
attached in any arbitrarily rotated position to the square<br>
openings, and in this way the directions in which the air flow is<br>
drawn off or blown in can be oriented in different directions.<br>
The fans can preferably be operated as suction blowers and<br>
pressure blowers.<br>
If the hose sections are designed to be resilient, their<br>
open ends can easily be guided to the components arranged at<br>
arbitrary locations in the interior of the switchgear cabinet. It<br>
is possible to charge the components with cooled air in a specific<br>
manner. It is also possible to draw off the heated air emitted by<br>
the components in a specific manner.<br>
The double-walled wall element is embodied as a heat<br>
exchanger, wherein the air conduit with a large surface provides a<br>
steep temperature gradient when filled with warm air. Good<br>
efficiency is achieved with this by means of the heat exchanger.<br>
The double-walled wall element can close off a lateral wall<br>
or the rear wall of the switchgear cabinet. However, it can also<br>
be designed to be the switchgear cabinet, door.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail by means<br>
of an exemplary embodiment, shown in a perspective partial view in<br>
the drawings.<br>
The switchgear cabinet of the exemplary embodiment has a<br>
rack 10, which is composed of vertical and horizontal frame legs<br>
11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, whose sides are or can be closed off by<br>
means of wall elements and at least one switchgear cabinet door.<br>
As the partial view shows, a vertical side, for example, of the<br>
rack 10 is closed off by means of a double-walled wall element 20,<br>
which consists of an outer wall section 21 and an inner wall<br>
section 22. Both wall sections 21 and 22 form a heat exchanger<br>
with a large surface with an air conduit 23 of a correspondingly<br>
large surface between the wall sections 21 and 22.<br>
The inner wall section 22 can also be divided into several<br>
wall panels in the vertical direction.<br>
Openings 25 have been cut in a grid shape, distributed over<br>
the entire surface of the inner wall section 21, which can be<br>
selectively covered by means of cover plates 26, fans 26, which<br>
can be operated in both directions of rotation, or connector<br>
plates 28 with hose sections 27. Equipping the openings 25 with<br>
these three built-in elements can be arbitrarily selected and<br>
optimally matched to the conditions prevailing in the interior of<br>
the switchgear cabinet and the distribution of the built-ins. For<br>
example, the heat absorbed by a cooling element 3 0 can be directly<br>
removed via a hose section 27, if the hose section is brought<br>
directly to this cooling element 30.<br>
By means of the fans 26 it is possible to draw-off heated<br>
air or to blow in cold air at all those locations of the inner<br>
wall section 22 at which openings 25 have been provided, if these<br>
fans 26 can be operated as suction and pressure blowers. Openings<br>
25 which are not used are closed off by means of cover plates 28<br>
in order to achieve defined flow conditions in the interior of the<br>
switchgear cabinet and over the heat exchanger.<br>
If the input and the output connecting planes of the fan 26<br>
are arranged at an acute angle in respect to each other, the fan<br>
26 can be attached to the square opening 25 in any arbitrarily<br>
rotated position. In this way the draw-in and blow-in directions<br>
of the fan 26 can be oriented in different directions, as can be<br>
seen from the two fans 2 6 represented in the drawings.<br>
The double-walled wall element 20 as the heat exchanger can<br>
also constitute the rear wall of the switchgear cabinet. However,<br>
it can also be embodied as the cabinet door.<br>
