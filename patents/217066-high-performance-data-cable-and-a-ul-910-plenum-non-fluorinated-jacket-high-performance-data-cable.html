				<td>HIGH PERFORMANCE DATA CABLE AND A UL 910 PLENUM NON-FLUORINATED JACKET HIGH PERFORMANCE DATA CABLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION	,<br>
This invention relates to high performance data cables that successfully enables transmission in the frequency range of 0.3 MHz to 1200 MHz and especially in the range of 1.0 to 600 MHz and/or 1.0 to 1000 MHz . Also to UL 910 high-performance plenum cables that have a non-fluorinated jacket.   More particularly, the invention relates to high-performance data cable which are bound- lateral shielded twisted pair cables. Also, this relates more particularly to the at least category 5 plenum UL 910 cables having a non-fluorinated jacket and a heat-resistant flame-retardant tape on the inner circumference of the jacket. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The current high performance data cables usually utilize as a shield a heavy, stiff, 2 mi! aluminum tape with a 1 mil polyester (Mylar ) backing. The shield is wrapped around each unshielded twisted pair subgroup within an application lay length that is equal to the length of the cables overall cable lay, typically lays of 4.0 to 6.0 inches. The tape is about 0.5 inches wide. The application angle of the wrapping is shallow, based on the long overall cable lay (5 inches) and the tape is almost parallel with the twisted pair laterally axis. A typical cable has 4 pairs of twisted pair cables with a 40 to 65% tinned copper<br><br>
braid applied over the four pairs and a final thermoplastic jacket extruded over the braided pairs to complete the cable. The shallow application angle of the metal shield tape generally creates the problem of allowing the tape to open up during the cabling operation before a binder or spirally applied drain wire can capture it.<br>
Also, the tape doesn"t generally follow the pairs contour under the tape. Tape gaps are created with this process around the unshielded twisted pair core that do not provide a sufficiently stable ground plane to meet the industry standard electrical requirements such as CENELEC pr EN 50288 -4 -1.<br>
The known cable structure noted above is mechanically unsound in a static state, and the electricais are unstable under installation conditions since the single overall braid cannot adequately insure the tape lap doesn"t "■flower"" open when the cable is flexed. This "flowering" increases NEXT, and further erodes impedance/RL performance as the ground plane is upset. This adds to attenuation non-uniformity. The impedance numbers are even worse under flexing since the conductor"s center to center, as well as the ground plane, changes. The higher the bandwidth requirement, the worse these issues become.<br>
We know of no cable structure for high performance UL 910 plenum data cables that have a non-fluorinated jacket. A plenum cable that used a fluorinated jacket and a temperature-resistant flame-retardant separator tape such as Nomex® (a temperature-resistant flame-retardant nylon manufactured by DuPont) was used and sold by Belden Wire &amp; Cable Company more than a year prior to this invention. The Nomex® tape in those cables kept the<br><br>
fluorinated (FEP) jacket from dripping and producing high peak smoke numbers in the UL 910 burn test. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Our invention uses on each twisted pair cable a lateral wrapped shielding tape that is bound with a fabric or metal binder to meet impedance/RL, attenuation uniformity, and capacitance unbalance that is required.<br>
Our invention eliminates most of the trapped air that is normally found in shielded twisted pair cables. This is done by utilizing a lateral wrapped shield with preferably a minimum 10% overlap and which has a 0.33 to 2.0 mil and preferably a 1 mil metal layer. The lateral wrapped shield is held together by an appropriate binder and preferably by a textile or metal braid or textile helically wrapped thread to provide good shielding with improved impedance control. When desired, a short fold can be applied along the lateral seam of the shield for improved EMI/Rfi isolation. The consistent ground plane created along the cables length allows better capacitance unbalance as well as improved attenuation uniformity through the reduction of RL reflections and capacitance unbalance.<br>
Our invention also provides for substantial geometric stability under flexing. The use of a tight lateral shield with at least a 10 % overlap and a textile or metal binder, eliminates tape gaps and flowering under flexing. This establishes a very stable level of physical and electrical performance under adverse use conditions. Our twisted pair cable center to center distances indicated as (d) in Fig. 3, and conductor to ground distances, remain much<br><br>
more stable than those of the previous cables.<br>
Our cables are especially beneficial for use as category 7 and higher performance cables. This is especially true for those cables that we laterally shield and bind and are used out to 600 MHz or 1000 MHz. The typical high-performance data cable when made according to our invention, has four (4) twisted pair cables with each twisted pair cable made up of two foam or non-foam insulated (fluorocopolymer or polyolefin) singles. Each of the twisted pair cables has the unique tight lateral metal shield tape wrapped around it with the tape and its lateral short fold seam tightly held in place with a tight binder such as a fabric or metal braid or a helical thread. When a braid is used as the binder, it is a 40 to 95% braid. When a thread is used, it is preferably helically wound. The bound-lateral shielded pairs are S-Z"d or planetary together into a bunched or bundled configuration. The bundled pairs may be bundled by an overall 40 to 95% braid or thread. A final thermoplastic jacket (fluorocopolymer or a polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride) is extruded over the bundled twisted pair cables.<br>
Generally the metal shield is an aluminum tape or a composite tape such as a short fold BELDFOIL tape (this is a shield in which metal foil or coating is applied to one side of a supporting plastic film), or a DUOFOIL tape (this is a shield in which the metallic foil or coating is applied to both sides of a supporting plastic film) or a free edge BELDFOIL tape. The overall metal thickness is 0.33 to 2.0 mil aluminum layer thickness and preferably about a 1.0 mil. Although aluminum is referred to, any suitable metal norrnally used for<br><br>
such metal and composite metal tapes can be used such as copper, copper alloy, silver, nickel, etc. Each twisted pair is wrapped with the metal facing outwardly and although the most preferred wrap is about a 25% overlap, the overlap may vary as a practical matter from 10 to 50%. The preferred shield that gives the best attenuation and impedance characteristics are those tapes that are joined to provide a shorting effect. However, with a suitable overlap, the short fold can be eliminated.<br>
The number of shielded twisted pairs in a high performance data cable is generally from 4 to 8 but may be more if desired. The tension of the laterally wrapped shield and the binder are such that the wrapped shield and binder eliminate most of the air to provide a standard impedance deviation for the bound-laterally shielded twisted pair cable and an average standard impedance deviation for the high performance data cable which has a plurality of laterally shielded twisted pairs. The tension on the shielding tape and binder are such that there is only a 25%) or less and preferably 18 % or less void space of the entire cross-sectional area of the laterally shielded twisted pair taken along any point in the length of the cable.<br>
We provide a high performance twisted pair data cable having a shield laterally wrapped around an unshielded twisted pair cable and a fabric or metal braid or yam simultaneously or subsequently wrapped around the lateral shield to bind the shield. The wrapping of the shield and binder(the braid or thread) is at a tension such that for an individual twisted pair that may be used on its own, the individual pair has an unfitted impedance that has a nominal or standard<br><br>
Tipedance deviation for each bound-laterally shielded twisted pair cable that is ated for up to 600 MHz a standard impedance deviation of 3.5 or less from 1.0 D 600 MHz and with no single impedance deviation being greater than 6.0, and Dr a cable rated for up to 1000 MHz a standard impedance deviation 4.5 or less rom 1.0-1000 MHz and with no single impedance deviation being greater than .0. The high-performance data cable which has a plurality of bound-laterally hielded twisted pair cables and is rated at up to 600 MHz has an average [andard impedance deviation for ail of the plurality of bound-shielded twisted airs of 3.5 or less from 1.0 to 600 MHz and with no single standard deviation jv any of the cables being greater than 6.0. The high-performance data cable /hich has a plurality of bound-laterally shielded twisted pair cable"s and is rated t up to 1000 MHz has an average standard impedance deviation for all of the lurality of bound-laterally shielded twisted pairs of and 4.5 or less from 1.0-000 MHz and with no single standard deviation for any of the cables being reater than 6.0.. The standard impedance deviation is calculated around a mean r average impedance of 50 to 200 ohms and with at least 350 frequency leasurement taken on a 328 ft. or longer cable.<br>
Also, we provide a high performance data cable that has the ability to be tbeled as a UL910 high perfopnance data plenum cable. This cable preferably as a non-fluorinated jacket and a temperature-resistant flame-retardant eparator tape beneath and in contact with the jacket.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an individual bound lateral shielded twisted pair data cable comprising an insulated twisted pair cable, a shielding tape selected from the group consisting of a metal tape, a first composite tape having a non-metal base and a layer of metal on one side of said base, and a second composite tape having a non-metal base and a layer of metal on both sides of said base; said shielding tape being laterally wrapped with at least a 10% overlap around said individual twisted pair cable; a fabric or metal binder being wrapped around said shielding tape to provide a bound lateral shielded twisted pair cable; said shielding tape having a metal thickness of 0.33 to 2.00 mils; said shielding tape and binder being wrapped around said twisted pair at a tension to eliminate a substantial amount of the air and to leave a cross-sectional void area of less than 25% of the cross-sectional area of the shielded twisted pair cable to provide said bound lateral shielded twisted pair data cable; and to provide said bound lateral shielded twisted pair data cable with an adjusted to 20°C standard impedance deviation of 4.5 or less when said standard deviation is calculated around a mean or average impedance of 50 to 200 ohms.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a twisted pair cable 10 having a pair of conductors 12 and 13 which are preferably solid copper conductors but can be any conductor that is suitable for high performance data cables. Each of the conductors 12 and 13 have extruded thereon an appropriate insulation 14 and 15 which may be foamed or non-foamed fluorocopolymer or an appropriate polyolefin.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the twisted pair of Figure 1, tightly wrapped with a metal shield 16. The metal shield can be any appropriate shield such as a metal<br><br>
tape or a composite tape with a non-metal base such as a polyester (i.e. MYLAR) having on one or both sides of the non-metal base a metal normally used in cable shields. The"metal for the tape and the composite tape being aluminum, copper, copper alloy, nickel, silver, etc. The thickness of the overall metal is 0.33 to 2.0 mil and preferably 1.0 mil. The shield is a metal shield such as, the short fold BELDFOIL type tapes, or the DUOFOIL type tapes which is a tape where metal is on both sides of the tape.<br>
The tape 16 is laterally wrapped with sufficient pressure as shown in Figure 3 so as not to crush the insulation 14 and 15 but to provide a small void space 17 that is less than 25% of the cross-sectional area shown in Figure 3. Preferably the void space is less than 18% of the cross-sectional area shown in Figure 3. The tightly wrapped tape 16 conforms to the outer shape of the twisted pair 10 to provide the laterally shielded twisted pair cable 10A. The tape 16 is wrapped with a slight overlap and with an optional short fold. As noted above, the preferred thickness of the aluminum or metal is I mil. The width of the tape is sufficient to provide a 10% minimum overlap.<br>
As shown in Figures 4A and 4B, the shielded twisted pair cable 10A(Fig. 3)"is tightly held together by a binder 18 or 18" to provide the bound-shielded cables 10B and IOC. The tension on the tape and binder wrap is sufficiently tight to conform to the contours of the unshielded twisted pair 10 to provide a substantially oval cross-section configuration but is not so tight that it will deform the insulation 14 and 15. The lateral wrapping and binding are done at such a tension that it eliminates substantially most of the air within the bound<br><br>
shielded twisted pair cables 10B and 10C. This provides at any point in the length of the cable, a tight oval cross-section with voids 17. This tight wrapping provides the standard impedance deviation and the average standard impedance deviation noted above.<br>
The insulation is preferably a foamed fluorocopolymer having a hickness of 0.010 - 0.060 inches and preferably 0.015 to 0.020 inches. The idividual conductors 12 and 13 are generally 20 to 30 AWG and preferably 22 )24 AWG.<br>
The conductors can be solid or stranded and are preferably solid. The ly length for all of the four twisted pair cables 10 may be the same or different nd right and/or left hand. The lay is preferably 0.3-2.0 inches. The overall able lay is generally 10 to 20 times the cable"s average core diameter.<br>
The binder 18 is either a fabric (i.e., Aramid) or metal braid which is referably a 40-95% braid. The metal is preferably a 45-65% tiimed copper raid but can be any type metal braid that would be appropriate for a high lerformance cable such as category 7 data cable, i.e. copper, copper alloy, ironze (a copper alloy which alloying element is other than nickel or zinc), ilver, etc.<br>
The binder 18" is a fabric thread (Aramide ) that is helically wrapped to irovide a 40-95% binding. We preferably use an Aramid 760 denier thread laving a 1/4 inch helical lay.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, the bound shielded cable 10B or IOC has a jacket i 9 extruded thereover to produce the high performance data.cable 20 of the<br><br>
resent invention. The jacket can be any suitable cable jacket material that would be suitable for a category 7 cable - a thermoplastic such as flame etardant polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, fluorocopolymers, etc.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a cable 20 having therein four braided-shielded twisted pair cables 10B. An optional ground wire 21 is between the cables 10B. The ;round wire of course can be located in any suitable location such as just under he jacket and /or used to bundle the four braided-shielded cables 10B.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a cable 25 having therein the four thread bound-hielded twisted pair cables 10C. The four thread bound-shielded twisted pair ables 10C are further wrapped or bundled with a metal or fabric braid 22. The raid 22 is generally the same type as that set forth above for braid 18. .An ptional ground wire 21 is between the cables 10C. As above, the ground wire f course can be located in any suitable location such as just under the jacket nd /or used to bundle the four thread bound-shielded cables 10C.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a cable 30 having a jacket 26, a helically or laterally wrapped separator tape 27 below the jacket. The separator tape 27 surrounds he four twisted pair thread bound-shielded cables 1OC and their binding braid 2.   The jacket 26 is a non-fluorinated jacket such as polyvinyl chloride. The eparator tape 27 is a temperature-resistant flame retardant separator tape such s Nomex®. The construction of this cable is similar to the cable of Figure 7 xcept this cable has the separator tape 27 and does not have a fluorinated icket. When desired, the plurality of these non-metal braided or serve shielded wisted pair .cables can be bundled .or wrapped by the ground wire 21. The •<br><br>
bundled twisted pair cables then have the separator tape placed thereover and the jacket 26 extruded thereover."<br>
As its shown in our following examples 1-7, the high performance praided lateral shielded twisted pair cables have an unfitted impedance that has I standard impedance deviation for cables rated up to 600 MHz, of 3.5 or less when taking at least 350 measurements of from 1.0 to 600 MHz and for cables •ated up to 1000 MHz, of 4.5 or less when taking at least 350 measurements from 1.0-1000 MHz.

EXAMPLE 9<br>
Two cables of Figure 8 were UL 910 tested. Each cable had four twisted pair thread bound-shielded cables 10C. Each of the cables shields 16 was a 2 mils aluminum/0.5 mills polyester tape having a 0.625 inch width. Each of the shields 16 were bound with an Aramid 760 thread. The four thread bound-<br><br>
shielded cables were wrapped with a 40% tinned copper braid,  the tour braid bundled cables were wrapped with a 2 mils Nomex separator tape having a 1.250 inch width. Over the separated tape was an extruded polyinyl chloride jacket. Both cables passed the UL 910 plenum test. During the UL 910 plenum test, the first cable registered a flame of 1.5 ft., a 0.32 Peak and a 0.09 Avg P/F. The second cable registered a flame of 1.5 ft., a 0.29 Peak and a 0.09 Avg P/F. Both cables would be rated as category 7"cables with a rating of up to lOOOMHz.<br>
Although our invention for the UL 910 plenum at least category 5 high-performance data cable was UL 910 tested on the cable of figure 8 which is a category 7 cable, it is understood that our invention is to be considered as not being limited to this specific construction of the cable but is directed to any category 5 or higher cable utilizing a non-fluorinated jacket such as a polyvinyl chloride jacket and between the jacket and cable core there is a temperature-resistant flame-retardant separator tape. For instance, we provide a UL 910 plenum high-performance data cable having a rating of up to 600MHz that has the structure disclosed in our co-pending application, which are tightly wrapped helical shielded twisted pair cables, and utilizing in that cable a non-fluorinated jacket such as a polyvinyl chloride jacket and between the jacket and cable core, a temperature-resistant flame-retardant separator tape. Our UL 910 plenum at least category 5 high-performance data cable is not limited to the cables just mentioned above but is for UL 910 plenum at least category 5 high-performance data cable that has a non-fluorinated jacket and between the jacket and cabl<br><br>
core, a temperature-resislant flame-retardant separator tape.<br>
