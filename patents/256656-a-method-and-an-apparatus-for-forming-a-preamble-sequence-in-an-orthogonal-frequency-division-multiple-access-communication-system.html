BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access communication system (OFDMA communication system)<br>
employing an orthogonal frequency division multiple access scheme, and more<br>
particularly to a method and an apparatus for generating a preamble sequence for<br>
an adaptive antenna system (AAS) in an OFDMA communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Fourth generation (4G) communication systems (i.e., the next generation<br>
communication system) are being designed to provide users with services having<br>
various qualities of service (QoS) and supporting a transmission speed of about<br>
100 Mbps. Particularly, in current 4G communication systems, research is being<br>
actively pursued to support a high speed service by ensuring mobility and QoS in<br>
broadband wireless access communication systems, such as a local area network<br>
(LAN) system and a metropolitan area network (MAN) system. A<br>
representative communication system currently under research is an Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16 communication system employs an orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
access (OFDM/OFDMA) scheme in order to enable a physical channel of the<br>
wireless MAN system to support a broadband transmission network. The IEEE<br>
802.16 communication system employs an orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing scheme 'OFDM' and an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
access scheme (OFDMA) scheme in order to enable a physical channel of the<br>
wireless MAN system to support a broadband transmission network. The IEEE<br>
802.16 communication system includes an IEEE 802.16d communication system<br>
and an IEEE 802.16e communication system. The IEEE 802.16d<br>
communication system considers only one state in which a subscriber station (SS)<br>
is currently motionless (i.e., one state in which the mobility of the SS is not<br>
entirely considered), and a signal cell structure. In contrast to the IEEE 802.16d<br>
communication system, the IEEE 802.16e communication system considers the<br>
mobility of an SS. Herein, for the convenience of explanation, a subscriber<br><br>
station with mobility is called a mobile subscriber station (MSS).<br>
Meanwhile, the IEEE 802.16e communication system uses a multi-<br>
antenna scheme to expand the communication system's cell service area and also<br>
employs a space division multiple access (SDMA) scheme to increase the<br>
communication system's capacity. In order to employ the SDMA scheme, it is<br>
necessary to design preambles so that the channel quality information (CQI) of<br>
each MSS can be precisely measured. A base station minimizes interference<br>
between beams by using the correlation between the preambles and generates a<br>
precise beam with a channel state estimated according to each MSS, so that the<br>
base station can correctly decode data by preventing a signal of one MSS from<br>
interfering with signals of other MSSs.<br>
Hereinafter, the construction of the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
employing the SDMA scheme will be described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG 1 is a diagram schematically illustrating the construction of a cellular<br>
system which employs a general SDMA scheme.<br>
A base station 101 assigns the same frequency resource and time resource<br>
to MSSs (not shown) different from each other so that the MSSs may<br>
"simultaneously use the same frequency resources and time resources in a first<br>
spatial channel transmitted through a first beam 102 and a second spatial channel<br>
transmitted through a second beam 103. In order to assign the same frequency<br>
resources and time resources to multiple MSSs as described above, it is necessary<br>
for the base station to form a plurality of beams spatially separated from each<br>
other.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to form the beams as described above in downlinks,<br>
correct state information of uplink channels is required. Therefore, in a typical<br>
IEEE 802.16 OFDMA communication system, an AAS preamble sequence to<br>
support the AAS is added to each of downlink and uplink frames to be transmitted,<br>
so that it is possible to determine correct state information of downlink and uplink<br>
channels.<br>
FIG 2 is a diagram schematically illustrating a frame structure of a<br>
general IEEE 802.16e OFDMA communication system.<br>
The frame of the IEEE 802.16e OFDMA communication system is<br>
divided into a downlink frame 201 and an uplink frame 202. The downlink<br>
frame 201 includes a downlink preamble section, a frame control header (FCH)<br>
section, a downlink MAP (DL-MAP) section, an uplink MAP (UL-MAP) section,<br>
a plurality of AAS preamble sections, and a plurality of downlink burst (DL burst)<br>
sections (e.g., downlink burst section #1, downlink burst section #2, downlink<br>
burst section #3 and downlink burst section #4).<br>
An downlink preamble section is an area for transmitting a synchronizing<br><br>
signal for synchronization acquisition between a transmitter and receiver (e.g., a<br>
base station and an MSS), that is, an area for transmitting a downlink preamble<br>
sequence. The FCH section is an area for transmitting basic information about a<br>
sub-channel, ranging, a modulation scheme, etc. The DL-MAP section is an<br>
area for transmitting a DL-MAP message and the UL-MAP section is an area for<br>
transmitting an UL-MAP message. Herein, information elements (IEs) included<br>
in the DL-MAP message and UL-MAP message have no direct relation to the<br>
present invention, so detailed description thereof is omitted. The AAS preamble<br>
sections are areas for transmitting a downlink AAS preamble sequence to support<br>
the AAS, and the downlink burst sections are areas for transmitting downlink data<br>
to target the MSSs.<br>
The uplink frame 202 includes a plurality of AAS preamble sections and<br>
a plurality of uplink burst (UL burst) sections, that is, uplink burst section #1,<br>
uplink burst section #2, uplink burst section #3 and uplink burst section #4.<br>
The AAS preamble sections in the uplink frame 202 are areas for<br>
transmitting an uplink AAS preamble sequence to support the AAS, and the<br>
uplink burst sections are areas for transmitting uplink data of the MSSs to target<br>
the base station.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 2, an AAS preamble is transmitted at a<br>
stage previous to each of the DL bursts and UL bursts. The base station<br>
estimates an uplink channel state by using the downlink AAS preamble sequence<br>
and generates a downlink beam corresponding to the estimated uplink channel<br>
state.<br>
However, in the current IEEE 802.16e communication system standard,<br>
distinct AAS preamble sequences for spatial channels different from each other<br>
(i.e., for beams different from each other) are not defined. Therefore, when a<br>
plurality of MSSs located at positions different from each other, each transmit the<br>
same preamble sequence by the same sub-carrier at the same time in an uplink, it<br>
is impossible for the base station to estimate a channel for each MSSs and<br>
generate a corresponding beam. That is, the conventional AAS preamble<br>
sequence cannot support the SDMA scheme in the OFDMA communication<br>
system. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a methodin which distinct AAS<br>
preamble sequences are assigned to spatial channels different from each other and<br>
thus each receiving side of the AAS preamble sequences can distinguish the<br>
spatial channels to generate a beam.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments according to the present invention<br>
will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the<br>
following description of the embodiments of the present invention, a detailed<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be<br>
omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and a method for generating<br>
preamble sequences for an adaptive antenna system (AAS) which can support a<br>
space division multiple access (SDMA) scheme in an Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) communication system (OFDMA<br>
communication system) employing an orthogonal frequency division multiple<br>
access (OFDMA) scheme, such as, for example, an IEEE (Institute of Electrical<br><br>
and Electronics Engineers) 802.16e communication system.<br>
Although the present invention will be described in relation to the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system for convenience of description, the apparatus and<br>
the method for generating preamble sequences (AAS preamble sequences) for the<br>
AAS proposed in the present invention may be applicable to other systems<br>
employing the OFDMA scheme or to other communication systems employing<br>
other suitable communication schemes.<br>
In allocating resources for the AAS structure of the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, one bin is assigned to each of mobile subscriber stations<br>
(MSSs). Herein, the bin implies that nine sub-carriers are occupied by one<br>
OFDM symbol. Therefore, the AAS preamble sequences according to the<br>
present invention are mapped onto nine sub-carriers according to the bin structure.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram schematically illustrating a bin structure in a general<br>
IEEE 802.16e OFDMA communication system.<br>
A bin includes eight data sub-carriers and one pilot sub-carrier, thereby<br>
including a total of nine sub-carriers. In this case, the pilot sub-carrier is located<br>
in the center of the bin. Also, six bins forms one sub-channel.<br>
Meanwhile, as described above with reference to FIG. 2, each of<br>
downlink bursts (DL bursts) and uplink bursts (UL bursts) in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system includes a plurality of sub-carriers. An AAS preamble<br>
sequence of one OFDM symbol length, which is defined in the same sub-carrier<br>
as that of each of the DL bursts and UL bursts, is inserted into the front portion of<br>
a corresponding DL burst or UL burst, and then the DL burst or UL burst is<br>
transmitted. In allocating resources for the structure of a sub-channel for the AAS<br>
and AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding) of the OFDMA system, one bin<br>
having a size of "nine sub-carriers x one symbol" is allocated to each of MSSs.<br>
Here, as described above, the size of the bin (nine sub-carriers x one symbol)<br>
implies that the nine sub-carriers are occupied by one OFDM symbol. In the<br>
following description, the basic unit of the AAS preamble sequence is nine sub-<br>
carriers and is arranged in the bin in a frequency range.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram schematically illustrating the structure of an AAS<br>
preamble sequence according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As described above, the AAS preamble sequence includes nine sub-<br>
carriers, that is, eight AAS preamble sub-carriers and one reserved sub-carrier.<br>
In this case, no signal is transmitted through the reserved sub-carrier. The eight<br>
AAS preamble sub-carriers carriers a signal obtained by multiplying the existing<br>
downlink preamble signal, which is carried by the eight AAS preamble sub-<br>
carriers, by an 8-ary Walsh code.<br>
In FIG. 4, "Wk(n)" represents an nth signal of a Walsh code corresponding<br><br>
a kth index, and "PR(n)" represents an nth sub-carrier of the existing downlink<br>
preamble sequence. In this case, the code index of the Walsh code is determined<br>
from a spatial channel index. Therefore, there may be a total of eight spatial<br>
channels.<br>
Meanwhile, the position of the reserved sub-carrier in the AAS preamble<br>
sequence can be expressed as shown in Equation 1.<br><br>
Herein, "Cell_ID" represents an identifier (ID) assigned to a<br>
corresponding cell. The position of the reserved sub-carrier changes depending<br>
on cells by a modulo operation of the identifier on nine. It is possible to reduce<br>
the interference between cells by changing the position of the reserved sub-carrier<br>
according to cells as described above. In addition, it is possible to measure the<br>
magnitude of the interference between cells at the position of the reserved sub-<br>
carrier.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating the construction of a transmitter for<br>
performing an AAS preamble sequence generation function in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The transmitter includes a data symbol generator 500, an AAS preamble<br>
sequence generator 510, a multiplexer 520, a sub-carrier mapping unit 521, an<br>
inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) unit 522, a parallel-to-serial converter 523,<br>
a guard interval inserter 524, a digital-to-analog converter 525, and a radio<br>
frequency (RF) processor 526.<br>
The data symbol generator 500 includes a data bit generator 501, an<br>
encoder 502, an interleaver 503, and a modulator 504. The AAS preamble<br>
sequence generator 510 includes a pilot sequence generator 511, a Walsh code<br>
generator 512, a reserved sub-carrier position selector 513, and a multiplier 514.<br>
First, when information bits to be transmitted are generated, the data bit<br>
generator 501 outputs the information bits to the encoder 502. The encoder 502<br>
receives the information bits output from the data bit generator 501, encodes the<br>
received information bits according to a predetermined coding scheme, and then<br>
outputs the encoded information bits to the interleaver 503. Herein, the coding<br>
scheme includes a convolutional coding scheme, a turbo coding scheme having a<br>
predetermined coding rate, etc. The interleaver 503 receives the signal output<br>
from the encoder 502, performs an interleaving operation with respect to the<br>
received signal, and then outputs the interleaved signal to the modulator 504.<br>
The modulator 504 receives the signal output from the interleaver 503, modulates<br>
the received signal according to a predetermined modulating scheme to generate a<br><br>
modulated symbol, and then outputs the modulated symbol to the multiplexer 520.<br>
Meanwhile, the pilot sequence generator 511 generates a pilot sequence<br>
corresponding to a predetermined cell identifier, and then outputs the generated<br>
pilot sequence to the multiplier 514. Herein, the pilot sequence generator 511<br>
operates to generate a pilot sequence in the same scheme as that described above,<br>
so detailed description thereof is omitted. The Walsh code generator 512<br>
generates a Walsh code selected by a beam index which is given according to<br>
system set up, and then outputs the generated Walsh code to the reserved sub-<br>
carrier position selector 513. The reserved sub-carrier position selector 513<br>
selects a position of the generated Walsh code to correspond to a given bin<br>
structure, and outputs the selected information to the multiplier 514. Herein, the<br>
reserved sub-carrier position selector 513 selects a position of the reserved sub-<br>
carrier varied depending on each cell, by a modulo operation of a cell identifier<br>
on the number of sub-carriers in relation to the cell identifier as described with<br>
reference to Equation 1, thereby reducing interference between cells.<br>
The multiplier 514 multiplies the pilot sequence generated from the pilot<br>
sequence generator 511 by the Walsh code output from the reserved sub-carrier<br>
position selector 513, and outputs a resultant signal to the multiplexer 520.<br>
The multiplexer 520 multiplexes the signal output from the modulator<br>
504 and the signal output from the multiplier 514 according to scheduling at each<br>
time point, and outputs the resultant signal to the sub-carrier mapping unit 521.<br>
The sub-carrier mapping unit 521 receives the signal output from the multiplexer<br>
520, maps the received signal onto corresponding sub-carriers, and then outputs<br>
the resultant signal to the IFFT unit 522. The IFFT unit 522 receives the signal<br>
output from the sub-carrier mapping unit 521, performs the IFFT for the received<br>
signal, and then outputs the resultant signal to the parallel-to-serial converter 523.<br>
The parallel-to-serial converter 523 converts the signal output from the IFFT unit<br>
522 into a serial signal and then outputs the serial signal to the guard interval<br>
inserter 524.<br>
The guard interval inserter 524 inserts a guard interval signal into the<br>
serial signal output from the parallel-to-serial converter 523, and outputs the<br>
resultant signal to the digital-to-analog converter 525. Herein, the guard interval<br>
is inserted to remove interference between a previous OFDM symbol transmitted<br>
at a previous OFDM symbol time and a current OFDM symbol to be transmitted<br>
a current OFDM symbol time when an OFDM symbol is transmitted in the<br>
OFDM communication system. Also, the guard interval is inserted in one of a<br>
cyclic prefix scheme and a cyclic postfix scheme. According to the cyclic prefix<br>
scheme, a predetermined number of last samples of an OFDM symbol in a time<br>
domain are copied and inserted into a valid OFDM symbol. According to the<br><br>
cyclic postfix scheme, a predetermined number of first samples of an OFDM<br>
symbol in a time domain are copied and inserted into a valid OFDM symbol.<br>
The digital-to-analog converter 525 receives the signal output from the<br>
guard interval inserter 524, converts the received signal into an analog signal, and<br>
then outputs the analog signal to the RF processor 526. Herein, the RF<br>
processor 526 includes a filter, a front-end unit, etc. The RF processor 526 RF-<br>
processes the analog signal output from the digital-to-analog converter 525 so that<br>
the signal can be transmitted over the air, and then outputs the RF-processed<br>
signal over the air via a transmission (Tx) antenna.<br>
In short, a data bit is generated by the data symbol generator 500 and an<br>
AAS preamble sequence is generated by the AAS preamble sequence generator<br>
510. Herein, the AAS preamble sequence is generated by multiplying a Walsh<br>
code, which is selected by a beam index, by a sequence generated by the same<br>
scheme as the conventional preamble sequence generation scheme. In this case,<br>
a position of a reserved sub-carrier is selected to correspond to a bin structure by<br>
the reserved sub-carrier position selector 513. Thereafter, the data bit and the<br>
AAS preamble sequence passes through the multiplexer 520, are mapped<br>
according to a sub-carrier assignment rule in the sub-carrier mapping unit 521,<br>
and then are OFDM-modulated to be transmitted.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for generating an AAS<br>
preamble sequence in the AAS preamble sequence generator shown in FIG. 5<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, the AAS preamble sequence generator 510 generates an 8-ary<br>
Walsh code corresponding to a beam index according to a given spatial channel in<br>
step 601, and then proceeds to step 603. In step 603, a position of a reserved<br>
sub-carrier is selected according to a base station number, i.e., a cell identifier<br>
(Cell_ID) assigned to the base station, corresponding to the generated Walsh code,<br>
and then step 605 is performed. In step 605, when the position of the reserved<br>
sub-carrier has been determined through the selecting step, an existing downlink<br>
preamble sequence and the generated 8-ary Walsh code are multiplied together<br>
with respect to sub-carriers except for the reserved sub-carrier, then the resultant<br>
signal is output. In this case, no signal is transmitted through a sub-carrier<br>
corresponding to a "Reserved_Subcarrier_Position", so power assigned to this<br>
sub-carrier can be used to the power of other sub-carriers.<br>
The "Reserved_Subcarrier_Position" is determined according to a cell<br>
identifier (Cell_ID) assigned to a corresponding base station. As used herein,<br>
the "Reserved_Subcarrier_Position" is defined as a remainder obtained by<br>
dividing the cell identifier by nine. Such a structure reduces interference<br>
between sub-carriers in a preamble with respect to nine sub-carrier domains when<br><br>
cells are properly arranged.<br>
Hereinafter, an AAS preamble sequence and an apparatus and a method<br>
for generating the AAS preamble sequence according to a second embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be described with reference to FIGs. 7 to 9.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, an AAS<br>
preamble sequence is defined for every spatial channel, that is, distinct sequences<br>
are defined for beams different from each other. Also, the AAS preamble<br>
sequence is generated by scrambling a sequence (e.g., a discrete Fourier<br>
transform sequence) having an orthogonal property to a downlink preamble<br>
sequence, that is, having high correlation with the downlink preamble sequence.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram schematically illustrating the structure of an AAS<br>
preamble sequence according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As described above, the AAS preamble sequence according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention is generated to be mapped onto nine sub-<br>
carriers, that is, nine AAS preamble sub-carriers. Also, the nine AAS preamble<br>
sub-carriers carry a signal, which is obtained by multiplying the existing<br>
downlink preamble signal carried by these sub-carriers by an orthogonal sequence<br>
of length "ine" generated through a 9-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT)<br>
operation. The signal obtained through the multiplication by the orthogonal<br>
sequence is one-to-one mapped onto sequences obtained by multiplying a cell<br>
identifier (Cell ID) by a downlink preamble sequence selected corresponding to a<br>
sector identifier (sector ID). Herein, a 9-point DFT-based orthogonal sequence<br>
is obtained by randomly selecting one row within a 9x9 DFT matrix shown in<br>
Equation 2.<br><br><br>
"Sk" is determined from a spatial channel index, which means that a total of nine<br>
spatial channels can exist.<br>
The FIG. 7 shows an example in which spatial channel #1 is multiplied by<br>
9-point DFT-based orthogonal sequence #1 "S1". Herein, "PR(n)" represents an<br>
nth sub-carrier signal of an existing downlink preamble sequence.<br>
The AAS preamble can be expressed equivalently in a time domain as<br>
follows. A signal "pr(m)" in a time domain obtained by applying the IFFT to an<br>
existing downlink preamble sequence PR(n) in a frequency domain is expressed<br>
as shown in Equation 4. Herein, the "pr(m)" represents an mth sub-carrier signal<br>
of an existing downlink preamble sequence in a time domain.<br><br>
Meanwhile, a time-domain signal of a AAS preamble<br>
sequence is expressed as shown in Equation 5. The and<br>
the are an equal signal expressed in a frequency domain and in a time<br>
domain, respectively.<br><br>
An AAS preamble proposed according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention is equal to a sequence obtained by shifting an existing downlink<br>
preamble sequence by integer times of "NFFT/9" along a time axis. Therefore,<br>
the AAS preamble can be obtained by shifting an existing downlink preamble<br>
sequence by integer times of "NFFT/9" along the time axis, instead of multiplying<br>
the existing downlink preamble sequence by a DFT-based sequence in a<br>
frequency domain.<br>
FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating the construction of a transmitter for<br>
performing an AAS preamble sequence generation function in the IEEE 802.16e<br><br>
communication system according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The transmitter includes a data symbol generator 830, an AAS preamble<br>
sequence generator 840, a multiplexer 850, a sub-carrier mapping unit 851, an<br>
IFFT unit 852, a parallel-to-serial converter 853, a guard interval inserter 854, a<br>
digital-to-analog converter 855, and an RF processor 856.<br>
The data symbol generator 830 includes a data bit generator 831, an<br>
encoder 832, an interleaver 833, and a modulator 834. The AAS preamble<br>
sequence generator 840 includes a pilot sequence generator 841, a DFT code<br>
generator 842, and a multiplier 843.<br>
First, when information bits to be transmitted are generated, the data bit<br>
generator 831 outputs the information bits to the encoder 832. The encoder 832<br>
receives the information bits output from the data bit generator 831, encodes the<br>
received information bits according to a predetermined coding scheme, and then<br>
outputs the encoded information bits to the interleaver 833. Herein, the coding<br>
scheme includes a convolutional coding scheme and a turbo coding scheme<br>
having a predetermined coding rate, etc. The interleaver 833 receives the signal<br>
output from the encoder 832, performs an interleaving operation with respect to<br>
the received signal, and then outputs the interleaved signal to the modulator 834.<br>
The modulator 834 receives the signal output from the interleaver 833, modulates<br>
the received signal according to a predetermined modulating scheme to generate a<br>
modulated symbol, and then outputs the modulated symbol to the multiplexer 850.<br>
Meanwhile, the pilot sequence generator 841 generates a pilot sequence<br>
corresponding to predetermined cell identifier and sector identifier, and then<br>
outputs the pilot sequence to the multiplier 843. Herein, the pilot sequence<br>
generator 841 operates to generate a pilot sequence in the same scheme as that<br>
described above, so detailed description thereof is omitted. The DFT code<br>
generator 842 generates a DFT code corresponding to a predetermined beam<br>
index, and then outputs the DFT code to the multiplier 843. The multiplier 843<br>
multiplies the pilot sequence generated from the pilot sequence generator 841 by<br>
the DFT code output from the DFT code generator 842, and outputs a resultant<br>
signal to the multiplexer 850.<br>
The multiplexer 850 multiplexes the signal output from the modulator<br>
834 and the signal output from the multiplier 843 according to scheduling at each<br>
time point, and outputs the resultant signal to the sub-carrier mapping unit 851.<br>
The sub-carrier mapping unit 851 receives the signal output from the multiplexer<br>
850, maps the received signal onto corresponding sub-carriers, and then outputs<br>
the resultant signal to the IFFT unit 852. The IFFT unit 852 receives the signal<br>
output from the sub-carrier mapping unit 851, performs the IFFT for the received<br><br>
signal, and then outputs the resultant signal to the parallel-to-serial converter 853.<br>
The parallel-to-serial converter 853 converts the signal output from the IFFT unit<br>
852 into a serial signal and then outputs the serial signal to the guard interval<br>
inserter 854.<br>
The guard interval inserter 854 inserts a guard interval signal into the<br>
serial signal output from the parallel-to-serial converter 853, and outputs the<br>
resultant signal to the digital-to-analog converter 855. Herein, the guard interval<br>
is inserted to remove interference between a previous OFDM symbol transmitted<br>
at a previous OFDM symbol time and a current OFDM symbol to be transmitted<br>
a current OFDM symbol time when an OFDM symbol is transmitted in the<br>
OFDM communication system. Also, the guard interval is inserted in one of a<br>
cyclic prefix scheme and a cyclic postfix scheme. According to the cyclic prefix<br>
scheme, a predetermined number of last samples of an OFDM symbol in a time<br>
domain are copied and inserted into a valid OFDM symbol. According to the<br>
cyclic postfix scheme, a predetermined number of first samples of an OFDM<br>
symbol in a time domain are copied and inserted into a valid OFDM symbol.<br>
The digital-to-analog converter 855 receives the signal output from the<br>
guard interval inserter 854, converts the received signal into an analog signal, and<br>
then outputs the analog signal to the RF processor 856. Herein, the RF<br>
processor 856 includes a filter, a front-end unit, etc. The RF processor 856 RF-<br>
processes the analog signal output from the digital-to-analog converter 855 so that<br>
the signal can be transmitted over the air, and then outputs the RF-processed<br>
signal over the air via a transmission (Tx) antenna.<br>
In short, a data bit is generated by the data symbol generator 830 and an<br>
AAS preamble sequence is generated by the AAS preamble sequence generator<br>
840. In this case, the AAS preamble sequence is generated by multiplying a<br>
sequence, which is generated by the same scheme as the conventional preamble<br>
sequence generation scheme, by a 9-point DFT-based orthogonal code selected by<br>
a beam index. The data bit and AAS preamble sequence passes through the<br>
multiplexer 850, are mapped according to a sub-carrier assignment rule in the<br>
sub-carrier mapping unit 851, and then are OFDM-modulated to be transmitted.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for generating an AAS<br>
preamble sequence in the AAS preamble sequence generator shown in FIG. 8<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, the AAS preamble sequence generator 840 generates a 9-point DFT-<br>
based orthogonal code corresponding to a beam index according to a given spatial<br>
channel in step 901, and then proceeds to step 903. In step 903, an existing<br>
downlink preamble (i.e., data bit) is multiplied by the generated 9-point DFT-<br>
based orthogonal code, thereby generating an AAS preamble sequence.<br><br>
Thereafter, the data bit and the AAS preamble sequence passes through the<br>
multiplexer 850, are mapped according to a sub-carrier assignment rule in the<br>
sub-carrier mapping unit, and then are OFDM-modulated to be transmitted.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, all the sub-carriers<br>
in an AAS preamble carry a signal, differently from the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention in which only 8 subcarriers carry a signal.<br>
As described above, according to the apparatus and the method for<br>
generating a preamble sequence for an adaptive antenna system (AAS) in an<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiple access communication system of the<br>
present invention, distinct preambles having orthogonal properties are assigned to<br>
different spatial channels in an OFDMA communication system using an AAS, so<br>
that a distinct beam can be formed for each of spatial channels. Since a distinct<br>
beam can be formed for each of spatial channels, it is possible to support a space<br>
division multiple access (SDMA). As a result, the same frequency resource and<br>
time resource can be reused. In addition, it is possible to increase cell capacity<br>
through the reuse of the same frequency resource and time resource.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
