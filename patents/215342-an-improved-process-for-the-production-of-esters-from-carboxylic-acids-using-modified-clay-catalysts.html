				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the production of esters from carboxylic acids using modified clay catalysts. The present invention particularly relates to an ecofriendly process for the production of esters from aromatic, aliphatic, α,ß-unsarurated, mono- and di-carboxylic acids using modified clay catalysts, dispensing the use of corrosive and toxic H2S04 and expensive resins. Thus, this process totally eliminates the disposal of salts formed consequent to the neutralisation of H2SO4.<br>
Development of solid acids to replace commonly employed mineral acid and anhydrous aluminium chloride in the classical Friedel-Crafts reactions, etherification and esterification practiced in conventional industry is of topical interest. The esters are widely used in the industry as intermediates in fine chemicals, drugs, plastisizers, perfumes, food preservatives, cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals, solvents and as chiral auxiliaries. The esterification reaction is used for the production of many large volume chemicals such as dimethyl tartrate, methyl cinnamate, dimethyl phthalate, methyl salicylate and other esters.<br>
Several effective methods are executed presently in the esterification process in indusrty using liquid/soluble acids. A British patent, Brit. 642-718, 13 Sept., 1950 describes the esterification of fatty acids with excess of monohydric alcohols in presence of H2S04. Another British patent by Celanese Corpn. of America, Brit. 710-803, June 16, 1954, describes a method for the esterification of acetic acid with ethanol to get ethyl acetate in presence of H2SO4. An US patent US 2686180, Aug. 10, 1954, described the preparation of methyl salicylate in 72% yields using carbodimides at 110°C with a tedious work-up procedure. Dow patented a method, US, 3154574, 27 Oct.64, for resorcinol esterification at 100°C using potassium carbonate, CO2, Conc. HC1, POC13, PhOH and PhMe.<br>
Condensing agents such as tosyl chloride, trifluoro acetic anhydride, polyphosphate ester and dicyclohexyl carbodimide are used to optimise the reaction of equimolar amounts of alcohol and carboxylic acids, but the workup procedure is tedious.<br>
In industry, the esterification is generally carried by H2SO4 which poses several problems such as corrosion of reaction vessels, catalyst recovery and waste disposal. Thus, it is desirable to use heterogeneous catalysts with advantages of ease of separation of the products, decreased corrosion of the reactor and possible regeneration of catalyst.<br>
The use of cationic exchangers as solid acid catalysts offer distinct advantages over conventional methods. In general, the strongly acidic sulfonated resins comprised of copolymers of styrene, ethylvinylbenzene, and divinylbenzene are used most widely in the industry. The inherent disadvantage in the application of these resins lies in the higher cost of the resins.<br>
Present trends in the area is set to develop solid acids from cheaply available sources, especially clays. A Japanese patent by Mitsui Petrochemical Inds. Ltd., Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho; Jp 5920413, 19 Nov, 1984 described the esterification of ethylene glycol with ethyl acetate in toluene under reflux conditions using Na~-montmorillonite as catalyst to produce 81% of monoester. British Petroleum Co., PLC, patent, U.K. Pat. Appl. GB-2175300, 26 Nov., 1986 described alkyl halides reacted with carboxylic acids at 200-300°C in presence of H~-montmorillonite to give esters in 95% yields. A Japanese patent, Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho Jp, 0341042, 21Feb., 1991 describes the etherification of Me2CHOH by Al3+-montmorillonite at 130-190°C under high pressures to give (Me2CH)2O. Japanese patent, Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho Jp, 03294243, 25 Dec., 1991<br>
describes carboxylic acids and alcohols or olefins reacts in presence of Zr2+-montmorillonite to give esters. Esterification process patented by Texaco Chemicals Co., US, 5183947, 2 Feb. 1993, describes tertiary butanol reacts with methanol in presence of phosphoric acid treated montmorillonite to give methyl-t-butyl ether. The use of high The pressures and temperatures make the processes unattractive.<br>
Although many useful and reliable methods for the esterification of carboxylic acids have been reported in the literature using other solid acids and solid super acids such as heteropolyacids supported on carbon, SiO2-Al2O3, zeolites, sulphated zirconia, and niobic acid in liquid and vapour phase reactions, the selectivities and the yields are not attractive prepositions.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of esters from carboxylic acids using modified clay catalyst which obviates the drawbacks of known methods. Another objective of the present invention is the development of environmentally friendly active solid acid catalysts for the esterification of carboxylic acids using cheaply available montmorillonite as a support.<br>
Metal-exchanged montmorillonite catalysts were prepared as described in example 1 and employed in the esterification reactions of carboxylic acids, example 2 to 24.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of esters from carboxylic acids using modified clay catalysts which comprises reacting carboxylic acids with alcohol in solvent medium in the presence of metal exchanged clay as catalyst for atleast at 80°C-130°C for a period in the range of 2.5 to 15hrs, and recovering corresponding esters by conventional methods.<br>
The clay catalyst used may be metal - ion exchanged clay, such as Cu2+, A13+, Zn2+, Ce3+, Fe3+ and H+.<br>
The alcohol used may be such as methyl and ethyl alcohols as the esterification agents and the amount used may range from 2.5 to 5 mmols/mmol of substrate.<br>
Carboxylic acids used may be such as malonic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, maleic acid, phthalic acid, cinnamic acid, stearic acid, azelic acid, p-isobutyl 2-methyl, phenyl acetic acid and chloroacetic acid.<br>
Solvent used for the reaction may be aromatic hydrocarbons such as Benzene and Toluene,<br>
Recovery of esters may be carried out by separating the catalyst through filtration and removing the solvent by rotavapor.<br>

TABLE 3<br>
Esterification of Chloroacetic acid with  Alcoholfs) (1:5 molar ratio) Using Fe3+ Montmorillonite as catalyst;<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Toluene was found to be an effective solvent than benzene in esterification of chloroacetic acid by Fe3+- montmorillonite based on the yields.<br>
The present process has the following advantages:<br>
1.	An ecofriendly process for the production of esters with better activity than the<br>
conventional process.<br>
2.	It was found that Fe3+ -montmorillonite displayed higher activity, and for the first time it<br>
was used in the esterification reactions. ( In Table 1, the reaction time is less with Fe3+-<br>
montmorillonite than with the other exchanged montmorillonites, Cu2+, A13+, Zn2+, Ce3+<br>
and  H+   In Table 2, the esterification of maleic acid with ET- montmorillonite gave<br>
66% of dimethyl maleate where as Fe3+- montmorillonite gave 100% conversion with<br>
78% dimethyl maleate and 22% monomethyl maleate).<br>
3.	The selectivity and yields are very good,<br>
4.	The reactions are simple with easy workup procedure.<br>
5.	The support of the catalyst is cheap and abundantly available in nature.<br>
6.	The use of H2SO4, hazardous and corrosive chemical is dispensed with.<br>
7.	The present process envisage no disposal problem as the catalyst can be used for several<br>
cycles. The catalyst was subjected to four cycles which displayed almost consistent<br>
activity.<br>
8.	The present process is environmentally safe since there is no effluent disposable<br>
problem.<br><br><br><br>
