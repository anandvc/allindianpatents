Field of the Invention;<br>
The present invention relates to a new industrially feasible process for the direct preparation of Gabapentin Form-II without the formation of Form- Ill.viathe Gabapentin acid addition salt to yield product that is substantially lactam free and very low content of chloride ions.<br>
Background of the Invention;<br>
Gabapentin, namely 1-aminomethyl-l-cyclohexaneacetic acids, of the Formula-1<br><br>
Gabapentin is the active ingredient used for the treatment of various cerebral diseases like epilepsy, hypokinesia including fainting and other brain trauma and in general, it is deemed to produce an improvement in the cerebral functions.<br>
Gabapentin and several processes for its preparation as the Hydrochloride sah, sodium salts are disclosed in US Patent Nos. US 4,024,175 and US 4,087,544.<br>
All processes described in the prior art e.g. in US Patent Application No. US 2003/ 0009055, US 6,465,689, US 5,091,567, PCX publications WO 02/ 44,123, WO 02/ 34,709, WO 00/ 01,660, WO 99 / 14,184 and European patent EP 1,174,418, yields Gabapentin hydrochloride which is converted to the corresponding free amino acid by neutralization with a basic ion-exchanger followed by crystallization. US 4,894,476 specifically discloses a method for converting the hydrochloride salt into a crystalline monohydrate by eluting the aqueous solution through a basic ion-exchange resin, producing a slurry from the elute, adding an alcohol to the slurry and isolating by centrifuging and drying.<br><br>
Alternate methods disclosed in US Patents US 5,132,451, US 5,095,148, US 5,091,567 and US 5,068,413 involve hydrogenation of the cyano intermediate to liberate the free amino acid.<br>
PCX publication No. WO 98/ 28255 discloses a method for the conversion of hydrochloride salt into Gabapentin Form-II via Gabapentin Form-Ill by elaborate multistep procedure of dissolution into a solvent, filtration of inorganics, distillation of solvent under vacuum in a heating bath at temperature below 35^C, then adding a second solvent, and neutralizing with a base at 25^C to yield Form-Ill. Form-Ill is then converted to Form-II by slurrying in methanol at 25^C for 14 hrs or recrystallising it from methanol.<br>
These processes are not industrially appropriate as large volumes of ion exchange columns and distillation of water are involved thereby leading to the formation of undesired lactam impurity. The method of conversion of hydrochloride into Form-II disclosed in PCT publication No WO 98/ 28255 involves the distillation of first solvent under vacuum at temperatures below 35*^C, then addition of a second solvent for crystallization of Form-Ill and finally an extra step for the conversion of Form-Ill to required Form-II by slurring in methanol thereby lowering the yields, and producing a product with unacceptable levels of chloride ions and enhancing the cost of the final product.<br>
In view of all the problems still there is a requirement of an industrial feasible process for preparation of Gabapentin Form-II with substantially lactam free and very low content of chloride ions.<br>
Summary of the invention;<br>
The present invention relates to a new industrial feasible process for the preparation of Gabapentin by converting the Gabapentin acid addition salts directly to Form-II without the formation of Form- III.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Gabapentin Form - II free from chloride ions and lactam impurity.<br>
The present invention overcomes the disadvantages associated with prior art methods, by neutralizing the Gabapentin acid addition salts with a base at higher temperatures followed by cooling.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of Gabapentin by reacting 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid monoamide in the presence of alkali hypo halite followed by acidification with mineral acid in presence of an organic solvent to extract the liberated acid addition sah into that solvent. An ante solvent is added to crystallize the Gabapentin acid addition salt. The separated salt is then, suspending in organic solvent and neutralizing with a base at a specified temperature range, cooled to ambient temperature, followed by separation of Gabapentin Form-II, which is further purified by slurring in ethanol.<br>
H^N COOH<br>
Crude Gabapentin and the pure Gabapentin precipitated are in the polymorph Form-II and are anhydrous. With the crystalline structure from the coincidence of the IR spectrum and X-ray diffraction pattern of those of the said conventional product.<br>
Further objectives and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the detailed description of the disclosed invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
Brief description of the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 is the X-ray diffraction pattern of the Gabapentin Form-II Fig. 2 is the FTIR spectrum of the Gabapentin Form-II<br><br>
Fig. 3 is the X-ray diffraction pattern of the Gabapentin Form-Ill<br>

Detailed description of the Invention:<br>
The process of the present invention comprises::<br>
•	Reaction of 1,1-Cyclohexane diacetic acid mono amide with alkali hypohalite solution, acidification with mineral acid in presence of a solvent<br>
•	Extraction of the formed acid addition salt into organic layer<br>
•	Separation of the organic layer, drying over dehydrating agents<br>
•	Addition of an ante solvent, cooling to precipitate the acid addition salt and its isolation<br>
•	Dissolution of acid addition salt in a short chain alcohol<br>
•	Filtration of the solution to remove the insoluble materials<br>
•	Neutralization of the filtrate with a base at specified temperature range to liberate the free amino acid<br>
•	Separation of the liberated free amino acid by cooling, leaving the formed byproduct base-salt in the mother liquor / solvent<br>
•	Separation of the formed Gabapentin Form-II<br>
•	Purification of the product by slurring in ethanol in a specified temperature range<br>
•	Isolation of the product followed by drying<br>
The Gabapentin acid addition salts are Gabapentin hydrochloride and Gabapentin hemisulphate hemihydrate.<br>
The precipitated Gabapentin and the purified Gabapentin are identified and confirmed as polymorph Form-II with the XRD and IR data.<br>
The 1,1-cyclohexane diacetic acid mono amide used as starting material is prepared as per the literature (US Patent No. 4,024,175).<br>

about -5^C to about 5^C. Acidification of the reaction mass to a pH of about 2.0 and preferably below 2.0 in the range of about 1.0 to about 1.5 is carried out with mineral acid, the preferred mineral acids are Hydrochloric acid and Sulphuric acid in presence of an organic solvent in a temperature range of about 15*^C to about 25*^C. The preferred solvent is n-Butanol.<br>
The reaction mass is allowed to settle and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted a few times with the organic solvent. The combined extracts is dried over dehydrating agents selected from anhydrous sodium sulphate, anhydrous magnesium sulphate and anhydrous calcium sulphate the preferred ones being anhydrous sodium sulphate or anhydrous magnesium sulphate.<br>
The dried organic layer is treated with ante solvent, cooled if required to precipitate the acid addition salt. The ante solvent is selected from the hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, alkyl ketones, alkyl ethers, the preferred solvent being hexane, toluene, acetone, di isopropyl ether or their mixtures.<br>
The precipitated acid addition salt is separated by conventional methods such as filtration, centrifugation and dried to constant weight.<br>
The Gabapentin acid addition salt is dissolved in short chain alcohols, preferred alcohol being ethanol, n-butanol at about 30^C to about 35^C, filtered to remove the insolubles, and then raising the temperature of the filtrate to about 70^C preferably from 65^C to 75^C, slowly neutralized with an organic base. The preferred bases are tri ethyl amine and di isopropyl ethyl amine, maintain the reaction mass for 1 - 2 hrs at the temperature about 70^C in the preferable range of about 65^C to about 75^C, cooling the mass gradually to about lO^C to about 25^C, preferably about 20^C to about 25^C, stirring for<br><br><br>
Gabapentin is further purified by suspending in ethanol, raising the temperature to 60*^C to 70*^0, maintaining the suspension at this temperature for about one hour followed by gradual cooling and stirring for about 1 -2 hrs at temperature 20^C - 25^C. The purified product so formed is isolated and dried to obtain Gabapentin with chloride ions, sulphate ions in the pharmaceutically acceptable range of below 100 ppm and lactam impurity below 0.1%.<br>
