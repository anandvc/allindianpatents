BY SPECTRAL CHEMISTRY AND SPECTRAL CONDITIONING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel methods for affecting, controlling and/or directing<br>
various reactions and/or reaction pathways or systems by exposing one or more components<br>
in a holoreaction system to at least one spectral energy pattern. In a first aspect of the<br>
invention, at least one spectral energy pattern can be applied to a reaction system. In a<br>
second aspect of the invention, at least one spectral energy conditioning pattern can be<br>
applied to a conditioning reaction system. The spectral energy conditioning pattern can, for<br>
example, be applied at a separate location from the reaction vessel (e.g., in a conditioning<br>
reaction vessel) or can be applied in (or to) the reaction vessel, but prior to other reaction<br>
system participants being introduced into the reaction vessel.<br>
The techniques of the present invention are applicable to inorganic reactions, organic<br>
reactions, biologic reactions and/or phase or structure change reactions. The invention<br>
specifically discloses different means for achieving the control of energy dynamics (e.g.,<br>
matching or non-matching) between, for example, applied energy and matter (e.g., solids,<br>
liquids, gases, plasmas and/or combinations or portions thereof), to achieve (or to prevent)<br>
and/or increase energy transfer to, for example, at least one participant (or at least one<br>
conditionable participant) in a holoreaction system by taking into account various energy<br>
considerations in the holoreaction system. The invention also discloses an approach for<br>
designing or determining appropriate physical catalyst(s) to be used in a holoreaction system.<br>

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chemical reactions are driven by energy. The energy comes in many different forms<br>
including chemical, thermal, mechanical, acoustic, and electromagnetic. Various features of<br>
each type of energy are thought to contribute in different ways to the driving of chemical<br>
reactions. Irrespective of the type of energy involved, chemical reactions are undeniably and<br>
inextricably intertwined with the transfer and combination of energy. An understanding of<br>
energy is, therefore, vital to an understanding of chemical reactions.<br>
A chemical reaction can be controlled and/or directed either by the addition of energy<br>
to the reaction medium in the form of thermal, mechanical, acoustic and/or electromagnetic<br>
energy or by means of transferring energy through a physical catalyst. These methods are<br>
traditionally not that energy efficient and can produce, for example, either unwanted by-<br>
products, decomposition of required transients, and/or intermediates and/or activated<br>
complexes and/or insufficient quantities of preferred products of a reaction.<br>
It has been generally believed that chemical reactions occur as a result of collisions<br>
between reacting molecules. In terms of the collision theory of chemical kinetics, it has been<br>
expected that the rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the number of the molecular<br>
collisions per second:<br>
rate a number of collisions/sec<br>
This simple relationship has been used to explain the dependence of reaction rates on<br>
concentration. Additionally, with few exceptions, reaction rates have been believed to<br>
increase with increasing temperature because of increased collisions.<br>
The dependence of the rate constant k of a reaction can be expressed by the following<br>
equation, known as the Arrhenius equation:<br>
k=Ae-Ea/RT<br>
where Ea is the activation energy of the reaction which is the minimum amount of energy<br>
required to initiate a chemical reaction, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature<br>
and e is the base of the natural logarithm scale. The quantity A represents the collision rate<br>
and shows that the rate constant is directly proportional to A and, therefore, to the collision<br>
rate. Furthermore, because of the minus sign associated with the exponent Ea/RT, the rate<br>
constant decreases with increasing activation energy and increases with increasing<br>
temperature.<br>
Normally, only a small fraction of the colliding molecules, typically the fastest-<br>
moving ones, have enough kinetic energy to exceed the activation energy, therefore, the<br>
increase in the rate constant k has been explained with the temperature increase. Since more<br>
high-energy molecules are present at a higher temperature, the rate of product formation is<br>
also greater at the higher temperature. But, with increased temperatures there are a number<br>
of problems which can be introduced into the reaction system. With thermal excitation other<br>
competing processes, such as bond rupture, may occur before the desired energy state can be<br>
reached. Also, there are a number of decomposition products which often produce fragments<br>
that are extremely reactive, but they can be so short-lived because of their thermodynamic<br>
instability, that a preferred reaction may be dampened.<br>
Radiant or light energy is another form of energy that may be added to the reaction<br>
medium that also may have negative side effects but which may be different from (or the<br>
same as) those side effects from thermal energy. Addition of radiant energy to a system<br>
produces electronically excited molecules that are capable of undergoing chemical reactions.<br>
A molecule in which all the electrons are in stable orbitals is said to be in the ground<br>
electronic state. These orbitals may be either bonding or non-bonding. If a photon of the<br>
proper energy collides with the molecule the photon may be absorbed and one of the<br>
electrons may be promoted to an unoccupied orbital of higher energy. Electronic excitation<br>
results in spatial redistribution of the valence electrons with concomitant changes in<br>
intemuclear configurations. Since chemical reactions are controlled to a great extent by these<br>
factors, an electronically excited molecule undergoes a chemical reaction that may be<br>
distinctly different from those of its ground-state counterpart.<br>
The energy of a photon is defined in terms of its frequency or wavelength,<br>
E = hv = he/?<br>
where E is energy; h is Plank's constant, 6.6 x 10-34 J sec; v is the frequency of the radiation,<br>
sec-1; c is the speed of light; and A. is the wavelength of the radiation. When a photon is<br>
absorbed, all of its energy is typically imparted to the absorbing species. The primary act<br>
following absorption depends on the wavelength of the incident light. Photochemistry<br>
studies photons whose energies lie in the ultraviolet region (e.g., 100A-4000 A) and in the<br>
visible region (e.g., 4000A-7000A) of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such photons are<br>
primarily a cause of electronically excited molecules.<br>
Since the molecules are imbued with electronic energy upon absorption of light,<br>
reactions occur from different potential-energy surfaces from those encountered in thermally<br>
excited systems. However, there are several drawbacks of using the known techniques of<br>
photochemistry, that being, utilizing a broad band of frequencies thereby causing unwanted<br>
side reactions, undue experimentation, and poor quantum yield. Some good examples of<br>
photochemistry are shown in the following patents.<br>
In particular, U. S. Patent No. 5, 174,877 issued to Cooper, et al. al., (1992) discloses<br>
an apparatus for the photocatalytic treatment of liquids. In particular, it is disclosed that<br>
ultraviolet light irradiates the surface of a prepared slurry to activate the photocatalytic<br>
properties of the particles contained in the slurry. The transparency of the slurry affects, for<br>
example, absorption of radiation. Moreover, discussions of different frequencies suitable for<br>
achieving desirable photocatalytic activity are disclosed.<br>
Further, U. S. Patent No. 4,755,269 issued to Brumer, et al. al., (1998) discloses a<br>
photodisassociation process for disassociating various molecules in a known energy level. In<br>
particular, it is disclosed that different disassociation pathways are possible and the different<br>
pathways can be followed due to selecting different frequencies of certain electromagnetic<br>
radiation. It is further disclosed that the amplitude of electromagnetic radiation applied<br>
corresponds to amounts of product produced.<br>
Selective excitation of different species is shown in the following three (3) patents.<br>
Specifically, U. S. Patent No. 4,012,301 to Rich, et al. al., (1977) discloses vapor phase<br>
chemical reactions that are selectively excited by using vibrational modes corresponding to<br>
the continuously flowing reactant species. Particularly, a continuous wave laser emits<br>
radiation that is absorbed by the vibrational mode of the reactant species.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,215,634 issued to Wan, et al., (1993) discloses a process of<br>
selectively converting methane to a desired oxygenate. In particular, methane is irradiated in<br>
the presence of a catalyst with pulsed microwave radiation to convert reactants to desirable<br>
products. The physical catalyst disclosed comprises nickel and the microwave radiation is<br>
applied in the range of about 1.5 to 3.0 GHz.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,015,349 issued to Suib, et al. al., (1991) discloses a method for<br>
cracking a hydrocarbon to create cracked reaction products. It is disclosed that a stream of<br>
hydrocarbon is exposed to a microwave energy which creates a low power density<br>
microwave discharge plasma, wherein the microwave energy is adjusted to achieve desired<br>
results. A particular frequency desired of microwave energy is disclosed as being 2.45 GHz.<br>
Physical catalysts are well known in the art. Specifically, a physical catalyst is a<br>
substance which alters the reaction rate of a chemical reaction without appearing in the end<br>
product. It is known that some reactions can be speeded up or controlled by the presence of<br>
substances which themselves appear to remain unchanged after the reaction has ended. By<br>
increasing the velocity of a desired reaction relative to unwanted reactions, the formation of a<br>
desired product can be maximized compared with unwanted by-products. Often only a trace<br>
of physical catalyst is necessary to accelerate the reaction. Also, it has been observed that<br>
some substances, which if added in trace amounts, can slow down the rate of a reaction. This<br>
looks like the reverse of catalysis, and, in fact, substances which slow down a reaction rate<br>
have been called negative catalysts or poisons. Known physical catalysts go through a cycle<br>
in which they are used and regenerated so that they can be used again and again. A physical<br>
catalyst operates by providing another path for the reaction which can have a higher reaction<br>
rate or slower rate than available in the absence of the physical catalyst. At the end of the<br>
reaction, because the physical catalyst can be recovered, it appears the physical catalyst is not<br>
involved in the reaction. But, the physical catalyst must somehow take part in the reaction, or<br>
else the rate of the reaction would not change. The catalytic act has historically been<br>
represented by five essential steps originally postulated by Ostwald around the late 1800's:<br>
1. Diffusion to the catalytic site (reactant);<br>
2. Bond formation at the catalytic site (reactant);<br>
3. Reaction of the catalyst-reactant complex;<br>
4. Bond rupture at the catalytic site (product); and<br>
5. Diffusion away from the catalytic site (product)<br>
The exact mechanisms of catalytic actions are unknown in the art but it is known that<br>
physical catalysts can speed up a reaction that otherwise would take place too slowly to be<br>
practical.<br>
There are a number of problems involved with known industrial catalysts: firstly,<br>
physical catalysts can not only lose their efficiency but also their selectivity, which can occur<br>
due to, for example, overheating or contamination of the catalyst; secondly, many physical<br>
catalysts include costly metals such as platinum or silver and have only a limited life span,<br>
some are difficult to rejuvenate, and the precious metals may not be easily reclaimed. There<br>
are numerous physical limitations associated with physical catalysts which render them less<br>
than ideal participants in many reactions.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is an understanding of the catalytic process so that<br>
biological processing, chemical processing, industrial processing, etc., can be engineered by<br>
more precisely controlling the multitude of reaction processes that currently exist, as well as<br>
developing completely new reaction pathways and/or reaction products. Examples of such<br>
understandings include methods to catalyze reactions without the drawbacks of: (1) known<br>
physical catalysts; and (2) utilizing energy with much greater specificity than the prior art<br>
teachings which utilize less than ideal thermal and electromagnetic radiation methods and<br>
which result in numerous inefficiencies.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention overcomes many of the deficiencies associated with the use of various<br>
known physical catalysts in a variety of different environments. More importantly, this<br>
invention discloses a variety of novel spectral energy techniques, referred to sometimes<br>
herein as spectral chemistry, and a variety of novel spectral energy conditioning techniques,<br>
referred to sometimes herein as spectral conditioning, that can be utilized in a number of<br>
reactions in a holoreaction system, including very basic reactions, which may be desirable to<br>
achieve or to permit to occur in a virtually unlimited number of areas. These spectral energy<br>
techniques can be used in, for example, any type of biological reactions (i.e., plant and<br>
animal), physical reactions, chemical reactions (i.e., organic or inorganic) industrial (i.e., any<br>
industrial reactions of large scale or small scale), and/or energy reactions of any type etc.<br>
Further, the invention discloses a variety of novel spectral energy conditioning<br>
techniques, referred to sometimes herein as spectral conditioning, or conditioning energies<br>
that can be utilized to condition a conditionable participant. Once a conditionable participant<br>
has been conditioned, the conditioned participant can be used in a reaction system. These<br>
spectral energy conditioning techniques can be used to condition at least one conditionable<br>
participant which can thereafter be used in, for example, any type of biological reaction<br>
system (e.g., plant and animal), organic or inorganic reaction system, industrial reaction<br>
system , etc. Further, the conditioned participant may itself comprise both a reactant and a<br>
reaction product, whereby, for example, the chemical composition of the conditioned<br>
participant does not substantially change (if at all) but one or more physical properties or<br>
structures and/or phases is changed once the conditioned participant is involved with, and/or<br>
activated by, the reaction system.<br>
These novel spectral energy techniques (now referred to as spectral chemistry) and<br>
novel spectral energy conditioning techniques (now referred to as spectral conditioning) are<br>
possible to achieve due to the fundamental discoveries contained herein that disclose various<br>
means for achieving the transfer of energy (or preventing the transfer of energy) and/or<br>
controlling the energy dynamics, and controlling the resonant exchange of energy between,<br>
for example, at least two entities. The invention teaches that the key for transferring energy<br>
between two entities (e.g., one entity sharing energy with another entity) is that when<br>
frequencies match, energy transfers. For example: (1) matching of frequencies of spectral<br>
energy patterns of two different forms of matter or matching of frequencies of a spectral<br>
energy pattern of matter with energy in the form of a spectral energy catalyst; and/or (2)<br>
matching of frequencies of spectral energy conditioning patterns of two different forms of<br>
matter or matching of frequencies of a spectral energy conditioning pattern of matter with<br>
energy in the form of a spectral conditioning catalyst. In the case of achieving the transfer of<br>
energy between, for example, a spectral energy conditioning pattern and a conditionable<br>
participant, once conditioning energy has been transferred, the conditioned participant can<br>
thereafter favorably utilize its conditioned energy pattern in a reaction system. The<br>
aforementioned entities may both be comprised of matter (solids, liquids, gases and/or<br>
plasmas and/or mixtures and/or components thereof), both comprised of various form(s) of<br>
energy, or one comprised of various form(s) of energy and the other comprised of matter<br>
(solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas and/or mixtures and/or components thereof)-<br>
More specifically, all matter can be represented by spectral energy patterns, which can<br>
be quite simple to very complex in appearance, depending on, for example, the complexity of<br>
the matter. One example of a spectral energy pattern is a spectral pattern (or a spectral<br>
conditioning pattern) which likewise can be quite simple to quite complex in appearance,<br>
depending on, for example, the complexity of the matter. In the case of matter represented by<br>
spectral patterns (or spectral conditioning patterns), matter can exchange energy with other<br>
matter if, for example, the spectral patterns of the two forms of matter match, at least<br>
partially, or can be made to match or overlap, at least partially (e.g., spectral curves or<br>
spectral patterns (or spectral conditioning patterns) comprising one or more electromagnetic<br>
frequencies may overlap with each other). In general, but not in all cases, the greater the<br>
overlap in spectral patterns (and thus, the greater the overlap of frequencies comprising the<br>
spectral patterns or spectral conditioning patterns), the greater the amount of energy<br>
transferred. Likewise, for example, if the spectral pattern (or spectral conditioning pattern) of<br>
at least one form of energy can be caused to match or overlap, at least partially, with the<br>
spectral pattern of matter, (e.g., a participant or a conditionable participant) energy will also<br>
transfer to the matter. Thus, energy can be transferred to matter by causing frequencies to<br>
match.<br>
As discussed elsewhere herein, energy (E), frequency (v) and wavelength (X) and the<br>
speed of light (c) in a vacuum are interrelated through, for example, the following equation:<br>
E = hv = hc/?.<br>
When a frequency or set of frequencies corresponding to at least a first form of matter can be<br>
caused to match with a frequency or set of frequencies corresponding to at least a second<br>
form of matter, energy can transfer between the different forms of matter and permit at least<br>
some interaction and/or reaction to occur involving at least one of the two different forms of<br><br>
matter. For example, solid, liquid, gas and/or plasma (and/or mixtures and/or portions<br>
thereof) forms of matter can interact and/or react and form a desirable reaction product or<br>
result. Any combination(s) of the above forms of matter (e.g., solid/solid, solid/liquid,<br>
solid/gas, solid/plasma, solid/gas/plasma, solid/liquid/gas, etc., and/or mixtures and/or<br>
portions thereof) are possible to achieve for desirable interactions and/or reactions to occur in<br>
various holoreaction systems in biologic, organic and/or inorganic systems.<br>
In order to practice the techniques of the present invention, it has been discovered that<br>
matter (e.g., solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas and/or mixtures and/or portions thereof) can<br>
be caused, or influenced, to interact and/or react (or be prevented from reacting and/or<br>
interacting) with other matter and/or portions thereof in, a reaction system along a desired<br>
reaction pathway by applying energy, in the form of, for example, a spectral energy provider<br>
such as a catalytic spectral energy pattern, a catalytic spectral pattern, a spectral energy<br>
pattern, a spectral energy catalyst, a spectral pattern, a spectral catalyst, a spectral<br>
environmental reaction condition and/or combinations thereof, which can collectively result<br>
in an applied spectral energy pattern being applied or provided in at least a portion of the<br>
reaction system. One example of this phenomenon, discussed in greater detail in the<br>
"Examples" section later herein, utilizes a sodium vapor light as a spectral energy pattern<br>
which results in enhanced formation of sodium chloride crystals from various aqueous<br>
solutions of NaCl in water.<br>
Likewise, matter (e.g., solids, liquids, gases and/or plasmas and/or mixtures and/or<br>
portions thereof) can be caused, or influenced, to interact and/or react with other matter<br>
and/or portions thereof in, for example, a reaction system along a desired reaction pathway by<br>
applying conditioning energy in a conditioning reaction system to a conditionable participant,<br>
in the form of, for example, a catalytic spectral energy conditioning pattern, a catalytic<br>
spectral conditioning pattern, a spectral energy conditioning pattern, a spectral energy<br>
conditioning catalyst, a spectral conditioning pattern, a spectral conditioning catalyst, a<br>
spectral conditioning environmental reaction condition and/or combinations thereof, which<br>
can collectively result in an applied spectral energy conditioning pattern being applied to a<br>
conditionable participant. Specifically, the applied conditioning energy results in a<br>
conditioned participant which, when exposed to, and/or activated by, a reaction system, can<br>
cause the reaction system to behave in a desirable manner (e.g., the conditioned energy<br>
pattern of the conditioned participant favorably interacts with at least one participant in a<br><br>
reaction system). Examples of this phenomenon, discussed in greater detail in the<br>
"Examples" section later herein, utilize a sodium vapor light as a spectral energy conditioning<br>
pattern for conditioning water prior to solutes being dissolved therein.<br>
In these cases, interactions and/or reactions may be caused to occur when the applied<br>
spectral energy pattern (or the applied spectral energy conditioning pattern) results in, for<br>
example, some type of modification to the spectral energy pattern of one or more of the forms<br>
of matter in the reaction system. The various forms of matter include reactants; transients;<br>
intermediates; activated complexes; physical catalysts; reaction products; promoters; poisons;<br>
solvents; physical catalyst support materials; reaction vessels; and/or mixtures of components<br>
thereof. For example, the applied spectral energy provider (i.e., at least one of spectral<br>
energy catalyst; spectral catalyst; spectral energy pattern; spectral pattern; catalytic spectral<br>
energy pattern; catalytic spectral pattern; applied spectral energy pattern and spectral<br>
environmental reaction conditions) when targeted appropriately to, for example, a participant<br>
and/or component in the reaction system, can result in the generation of, and/or desirable<br>
interaction with one or more participants. Specifically, the applied spectral energy provider<br>
can be targeted to achieve very specific desirable results and/or reaction product and/or<br>
reaction product at a desired rate and/or along a desired reaction pathway).<br>
The targeting can occur by a direct resonance approach, (i.e., direct resonance<br>
targeting), a harmonic resonance approach (i.e., harmonic targeting) and/or a non-harmonic<br>
heterodyne resonance approach (i.e., non-harmonic heterodyne targeting). The spectral<br>
energy provider can be targeted to, for example, interact with at least one frequency or field<br>
of an atom or molecule, including, but not limited to, electronic frequencies, vibrational<br>
frequencies, rotational frequencies, rotational-vibrational frequencies, librational frequencies,<br>
translational frequencies, gyrational frequencies, fine splitting frequencies, hyperfine splitting<br>
frequencies, magnetic field induced frequencies, electric field induced frequencies, natural<br>
oscillating frequencies, and all components and/or portions thereof (discussed in greater<br>
detail later herein; and specific examples being given in Table D). These approaches may<br>
result in, for example, the mimicking of at least one mechanism of action of a physical<br>
catalyst in a reaction system.<br>
Similar concepts also apply to utilizing an applied spectral energy conditioning<br>
pattern in a conditioning reaction system. In the case where one applied spectral energy<br>
conditioning pattern is utilized, interactions and/or reactions may be caused to occur in the<br><br>
conditioning reaction system when the applied spectral energy conditioning pattern results in,<br>
for example, some type of modification to the spectral energy pattern of one or more<br>
conditionable participants prior to such participant(s) being involved in, and/or activated by,<br>
the reaction system. The various forms of matter that can be used as a conditionable<br>
participant include: reactants; physical catalysts; reaction products; promoters; poisons;<br>
solvents; physical catalyst support materials; reaction vessels; conditioning reaction vessels;<br>
and/or mixtures of components thereof. For example, the applied spectral energy<br>
conditioning provider (e.g., at least one of a: spectral energy conditioning catalyst; spectral<br>
conditioning catalyst; spectral energy conditioning pattern; spectral conditioning pattern;<br>
catalytic spectral energy conditioning pattern; catalytic spectral conditioning pattern; applied<br>
spectral energy conditioning pattern and spectral conditioning environmental reaction<br>
conditions) when targeted appropriately to, for example, a conditionable participant and/or<br>
component thereof prior to the conditionable participant, and/or component thereof,<br>
becoming involved in, and/or activated by, the reaction system, can result in the generation of<br>
a desirable reaction product, and/or desirable interaction with one or more participants in the<br>
reaction system. Specifically, the applied spectral energy conditioning provider can be<br>
targeted to a conditionable participant to achieve very specific desirable results (e.g., a very<br>
specific conditioned energy pattern). The desirable conditioned energy pattern can thereafter<br>
result in a desirable reaction pathway, a desirable reaction product and/or at a desired rate in a<br>
reaction system, when the conditioned participant becomes involved with or activated in the<br>
reaction system. Further, the conditioned participant may itself comprise both a reactant and<br>
a reaction product, whereby, for example, the chemical composition of the conditioned<br>
participant does not substantially change (if at all) but one or more physical properties or<br>
structures or phases or relationship(s) in one or more of its energy structure(s) is changed<br>
once the conditioned participant is involved with, and/or activated by, the reaction system.<br>
The conditioning targeting can occur by a direct resonance conditioning approach,<br>
(i.e., direct resonance conditioning targeting), a harmonic resonance conditioning, approach<br>
(i.e., harmonic conditioning targeting), non-harmonic heterodyne conditioning resonance<br>
approach (i.e., non-harmonic heterodyne conditioning targeting). The spectral energy<br>
conditioning provider can be targeted to, for example, interact with the conditionable<br>
participant by interacting with at least one frequency of an atom or molecule, including, but<br>
not limited to, electronic frequencies, vibrational frequencies, rotational frequencies,<br><br>
rotational-vibrational frequencies, fine splitting frequencies, hyperfine splitting frequencies,<br>
magnetic field induced frequencies, electric field induced frequencies, natural oscillating<br>
frequencies, and all components and/or portions thereof (discussed in greater detail later<br>
herein). Some examples of known sources of spectral energy conditioning providers include,<br>
but are not limited to, ELF sources, VLF sources, radio sources, microwave sources, infrared<br>
sources, visible light sources, ultraviolet sources, x-ray sources and gamma ray sources.<br>

In some cases, desirable results in a reaction system may be achieved by utilizing a<br>
single applied spectral energy pattern targeted to a single participant; while in other cases,<br>
more than one applied spectral energy pattern may be targeted to a single participant or<br>
multiple participants, by, for example, multiple approaches in a single reaction system.<br>
Specifically, combinations of direct resonance targeting, harmonic targeting and non-<br>
harmonic heterodyne targeting, which can be made to interact with one or more frequencies<br>
occurring in atoms and/or molecules, could be used sequentially or substantially<br>
continuously. Further, in certain cases, the spectral energy provider targeting may result in<br><br>
various interactions at predominantly the upper energy levels of one or more of the various<br>
forms of matter present in a reaction system.<br>
Further, desirable results may be achieved once a conditioned participant is exposed<br>
to (e.g., activated in) a reaction system and/or the conditioned participant may enhance<br>
certain reaction pathways and/or reaction rates (e.g., kinetics of a reaction may be increased<br>
or decreased; or reaction products may be altered, increased or decreased). For example, in<br>
some cases, desirable results may be achieved by utilizing a single applied spectral energy<br>
conditioning pattern targeted to a single conditionable participant; while in other cases, more<br>
than one applied spectral energy conditioning pattern may be targeted to a single<br>
conditionable participant or to multiple conditionable participants, by, for example, multiple<br>
approaches. Specifically, combinations of direct resonance conditioning targeting, harmonic<br>
conditioning targeting and non-harmonic heterodyne conditioning targeting, which can be<br>
made to interact with one or more frequencies occurring in atoms and/or molecules of a<br>
conditionable participant, could be used sequentially or substantially continuously to create<br>
desirable conditioned participants. Further, in certain cases, the spectral energy conditioning<br>
provider targeting may result in various interactions at predominantly the upper energy levels<br>
of one or more of the various forms of matter present as a conditionable participant.<br>
Still further, numerous combinations of the aforementioned applied spectral energy<br>
patterns and applied spectral energy conditioning patters could be used in a holoreaction<br>
system to target participants and/or conditionable participants. For example, applied spectral<br>
energy patterns could be directed to one or more participants; and/or applied spectral energy<br>
conditioning patterns could be directed to one or more conditionable participants. In some<br>
holoreaction systems, a spectral energy pattern and a spectral energy conditioning pattern<br>
may be substantially similar to each other (e.g., exactly the same or at least comprising<br>
similar portions of the electromagnetic spectrum) or very different from each other (e.g.,<br>
comprising similar or very different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum). The<br>
combination of one or more spectral energy patterns with one or more spectral energy<br>
conditioning patters could have significant implications for control of various reaction<br>
pathways and/or reaction rates in a reaction system.<br>
The invention further recognizes and explains that various environmental reaction<br>
conditions are capable of influencing reaction pathways in a reaction system when using a<br>
spectral energy catalyst such as a spectral catalyst. The invention teaches specific methods<br>
for controlling various environmental reaction conditions in order to achieve desirable results<br>
in a reaction (e.g., desirable reaction product(s) in one or more desirable reaction pathway(s))<br>
and/or interactions. The invention further discloses an applied spectral energy approach<br>
which permits the simulation, at least partially, of desirable environmental reaction<br>
conditions by the application of at least one, for example, spectral environmental reaction<br>
conditions. Thus, environmental reaction conditions can be controlled and used in<br>
combination with at least one spectral energy pattern to achieve a desired reaction pathway.<br>
Alternatively, traditionally utilized environmental reaction conditions can be modified in a<br>
desirable manner (e.g., application of a reduced temperature and/or reduced pressure) by<br>
supplementing and/or replacing the traditional environmental reaction condition(s) with at<br>
least one spectral environmental reaction condition.<br>
Similarly, the invention further recognizes and explains that various conditioning<br>
environmental reaction conditions are capable of influencing the resultant energy pattern of a<br>
conditionable participant, which, when such conditioned participant becomes involved with,<br>
and/or activated in, a reaction system, can influence reaction pathways in a reaction system.<br>
The invention teaches specific methods for controlling various conditioning environmental<br>
reaction conditions in order to achieve desirable conditioning of at least one conditionable<br>
participant which in turn can achieve desirable results (e.g., desirable reaction product(s)<br>
and/or one or more desirable reaction pathway(s) and/or desirable interactions and/or<br>
desirable reaction raters) in a reaction system. The invention further discloses an applied<br>
spectral energy conditioning approach which permits the simulation, at least partially, of<br>
desirable environmental reaction conditions by the application of at least one, for example,<br>
spectral conditioning environmental reaction condition. Thus, conditioning environmental<br>
reaction conditions can be controlled and used in combination with at least one spectral<br>
energy conditioning pattern to achieve a desired conditioned energy pattern in a conditioned<br>
participant. Alternatively, traditionally utilized environmental reaction conditions can be<br>
modified in a desirable manner (e.g., application of a reduced temperature and/or reduced<br>
pressure) by supplementing and/or replacing the traditional environmental reaction<br>
condition(s) with at least one spectral conditioning environmental reaction condition.<br>
The invention also provides a method for determining desirable physical catalysts<br>
(i.e., comprising previously known materials or materials not previously known to function as<br>
a physical catalyst which can be utilized in a reaction system to achieve a desired reaction<br><br>
pathway and/or desired reaction rate. In this regard, the invention may be able to provide a<br>
recipe for a physical and/or spectral catalyst for a particular reaction in a reaction system<br>
where no physical catalyst previously existed. In this embodiment of the invention, spectral<br>
energy patterns are determined or calculated by the techniques of the invention and<br>
corresponding physical catalysts can be supplied or manufactured and thereafter included in<br>
the reaction system to generate the calculated required spectral energy patterns. In certain<br>
cases, one or more existing physical species could be used or combined in a suitable manner,<br>
if a single physical species was deemed to be insufficient, to obtain the appropriate calculated<br>
spectral energy pattern to achieve a desired reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate.<br>
Such catalysts can be used alone, in combination with other physical catalysts, spectral<br>
energy catalysts, controlled environmental reaction conditions and/or spectral environmental<br>
reaction conditions to achieve a desired resultant energy pattern and consequent reaction<br>
pathway and/or desired reaction rate.<br>
Similarly, the invention also provides a method for determining desirable physical<br>
catalysts (e.g., comprising previously known materials or materials not previously known to<br>
function as a physical catalyst) which can be utilized in a reaction system by appropriately<br>
conditioning at least one conditionable participant to achieve a desired reaction pathway<br>
and/or desired reaction rate and/or desired reaction product when the conditioned participant<br>
becomes involved with (e.g., is added to or activated in) the reaction system. In this regard,<br>
the invention may be able to provide a recipe for a physical and/or spectral catalyst for a<br>
particular reaction system where no physical catalyst previously existed. In this embodiment<br>
of the invention, spectral energy conditioning patterns are determined or calculated by the<br>
techniques of the invention and corresponding conditionable participants can be supplied or<br>
manufactured and thereafter included in the conditioning reaction system to generate the<br>
calculated required spectral energy patterns in a conditioned participant. In certain cases, one<br>
or more existing physical species of a conditionable participant could be used or combined in<br>
a suitable manner, if a single physical species was deemed to be insufficient, to obtain the<br>
appropriate calculated spectral energy conditioned pattern to achieve a desired reaction<br>
pathway and/or desired reaction rate. Such conditioned participant, can be used alone, in<br>
combination with other physical catalysts, spectral energy catalysts, spectral energy catalysts,<br>
controlled environmental reaction conditions, spectral environmental reaction conditions<br>
and/or spectral environmental reaction conditions to achieve a desired reaction pathway<br><br>
and/or desired reaction rate. Thus, once a desired conditioned energy pattern is achieved in a<br>
conditionable participant, the conditionable participant becomes involved with, and/or<br>
activated in, the reaction system.<br>
The invention discloses many different permutations of one important theme of the<br>
invention, namely, that when frequencies of participants in a holoreaction system match, or<br>
can be made to match, such as, by conditioning at least one conditionable participant, energy<br>
transfers between the components, participants or conditioned participants in the holoreaction<br>
system. It should be understood that these many different permutations can be used alone to<br>
achieve desirable results (e.g., desired reaction pathways and/or a desired reaction rates<br>
and/or desired reaction products) or can be used in a limitless combination of permutations,<br>
to achieve desired results (e.g., desired reaction pathways, desired reaction products and/or<br>
desired reaction rates). However, in a first preferred embodiment of the invention, so long as<br>
a participant, or conditioned participant, has one or more of its frequencies that match with at<br>
least one frequency of at least one other participant in a holoreaction system (e.g., spectral<br>
patterns overlap), energy can be transferred. If energy is transferred in this targeted manner,<br>
desirable interactions, reactions and/or energy dynamics can result in the holoreaction<br>
system, such as increased energy amplitudes in key components involved in one or more<br>
reactions in the holoreaction system. Further, the conditioned participant may itself comprise<br>
both a reactant and a reaction product, whereby, for example, the chemical composition of<br>
the conditioned participant does not substantially change (if at all) but one or more physical<br>
properties or structures or phases is changed once the conditioned participant is involved<br>
with, and/or activated by, the reaction system.<br>
Further, the same targeted frequency or energy can be used with different power<br>
amplitudes, in the same holoreaction system, to achieve dramatically different results. For<br>
example, the vibrational frequency of a liquid solvent may be input at low power amplitudes<br>
to improve the solvent properties of the liquid without causing any substantial change in the<br>
chemical composition of the liquid. At higher power levels, the same vibrational frequency<br>
can be used to dissociate the liquid solvent, thereby changing its chemical composition.<br>
Thus, there is a continuum of effects that can be obtained with a single targeted frequency,<br>
ranging from changes in the energy dynamics of a participant, to changes in the actual<br>
chemical or physical structure of a participant.<br>
Moreover, the concept of frequencies matching can also be used in the reverse.<br>
Specifically, if a reaction in a reaction system is occurring because frequencies match, the<br>
reaction can be slowed or stopped by causing the frequencies to no longer match or at least<br>
match to a lesser degree. In this regard, one or more reaction system components (e.g.,<br>
environmental reaction condition, spectral environmental reaction condition and/or an applied<br>
spectral energy pattern) can be modified and/or applied so as to minimize, reduce or<br>
eliminate frequencies from matching. This also permits reactions to be started and stopped<br>
with ease providing for novel control in a myriad of reactions in a reaction system including<br>
preventing the formation of certain species, controlling the amount of product formed in a<br>
reaction system, etc. Further, if a source of, for example, electromagnetic radiation includes<br>
a somewhat larger spectrum of wavelengths or frequencies (i.e., energies) than those which<br>
are needed to optimize (or prevent) a particular reaction in a reaction system, then some of<br>
the unnecessary (or undesirable) wavelengths can be prevented from coming into contact<br>
with the reaction system (e.g., can be blocked, reflected, absorbed, etc.) by an appropriate<br>
filtering, absorbing and/or reflecting technique as discussed in greater detail later herein.<br>
Moreover, the concept of frequencies matching can also be used in the reverse for<br>
conditionable participants. Specifically, if a reaction is occurring because frequencies match,<br>
the reaction can be slowed or stopped by causing the frequencies to no longer match or at<br>
least match to a lesser degree. In this regard, one or more reaction system components (e.g.,<br>
environmental reaction condition, spectral environmental reaction condition and/or an applied<br>
spectral energy pattern) can be modified by introducing a conditionable participant, once<br>
conditioned, so as to minimize, reduce or eliminate frequencies from matching in the reaction<br>
system. This also permits reactions to be started and stopped with ease providing for novel<br>
control in a myriad of reactions in a reaction system including preventing the formation of<br>
certain species, controlling the amount of product formed in a reaction system, etc. Further,<br>
if a source of, for example electromagnetic radiation includes a somewhat larger spectrum of<br>
wavelengths or frequencies (i.e., energies) than those which are needed to optimize (or<br>
prevent) a particular reaction in a reaction system, then some of the unnecessary (or<br>
undesirable) wavelengths can be prevented from coming into contact with the reaction system<br>
(e.g., can be blocked, reflected, absorbed, etc.) by an appropriate filtering, absorbing and/or<br>
reflecting technique as discussed in greater detail later herein.<br>
It should also be apparent that various conditionable participants, once conditioned,<br>
con be used in combination with various participants and/or spectral energy providers in a<br>
reaction system to control numerous reaction pathways.<br>
Further, a conditionable participant may be conditioned by removing at least a portion<br>
of its spectral pattern prior to the conditionable participant being introduced as a conditioned<br>
participant into a reaction system.<br>
To simplify the disclosure and understanding of the invention, specific categories or<br>
sections have been created in the "Summary of the Invention" and in the "Detailed<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiments". However, it should be understood that these<br>
categories are not mutually exclusive and that some overlap exists. Accordingly, these<br>
artificially created sections should not be used in an effort to limit the scope of the invention<br>
defined in the appended claims.<br>
Further, in the following Sections, attempts have been made to simplify discussions<br>
and reduce the overall length of this disclosure. For example, in many instances,<br>
"participants" in a reaction or holoreaction system are exclusively referred to. However, it<br>
should be understood that "conditionable participants" could also be separately addressed in<br>
the disclosure, even though not always expressly referred to herein. Thus, when the various<br>
general mechanisms of the invention are referred to herein, even if reference is made directly<br>
or indirectly to "participants" only, it should be understood that the discussion also applies to<br>
"conditionable participants" with similar relevancy. Efforts have been made throughout the<br>
disclosure to refer expressly to all of the novel phenomenon associated with conditionable<br>
participants only when required for clarification purposes.<br>
I. WAVE ENERGIES<br>
In general, thermal energy has traditionally been used to drive chemical reactions by<br>
applying heat and increasing the temperature of a reaction system. The addition of heat<br>
increases the kinetic (motion) energy of the chemical reactants. It has been believed that a<br>
reactant with more kinetic energy moves faster and farther, and is more likely to take part in a<br>
chemical reaction. Mechanical energy likewise, by stirring and moving the chemicals,<br>
increases their kinetic energy and thus their reactivity. The addition of mechanical energy<br>
often increases temperature, by increasing kinetic energy.<br>
Acoustic energy is applied to chemical reactions as orderly mechanical waves.<br>
Because of its mechanical nature, acoustic energy can increase the kinetic energy of chemical<br>
reactants, and can also elevate their temperature(s). Electromagnetic (EM) energy consists of<br>
waves of electric and magnetic fields. EM energy may also increase the kinetic energy and<br>
heat in reaction systems. It also may energize electronic orbitals or vibrational motion in<br>
some reactions.<br>
Both acoustic and electromagnetic energy consist of waves.. Energy waves and<br>
frequency have some interesting properties, and may be combined in some interesting ways.<br>
The manner in which wave energy transfers and combines, depends largely on the frequency.<br>
For example, when two waves of energy, each having the same amplitude, but one at a<br>
frequency of 400 Hz and the other at 100 Hz are caused to interact, the waves will combine<br>
and their frequencies will add, to produce a new frequency of 500 Hz (i.e., the "sum"<br>
frequency). The frequency of the waves will also subtract when they combine to produce a<br>
frequency of 300 Hz (i.e., the "difference" frequency). All wave energies typically add and<br>
subtract in this manner, and such adding and subtracting is referred to as heterodyning.<br>
Common results of heterodyning are familiar to most as harmonics in music. The importance<br>
of heterodyning will be discussed in greater detail later herein.<br>
Another concept important to the invention is wave interactions or interference. In<br>
particular, wave energies are known to interact constructively and destructively. These<br>
phenomena are important in determining the applied spectral energy pattern. Figures la-lc<br>
show two different incident sine waves 1 (Figure la) and 2 (Figure 1b) which correspond to<br>
two different spectral energy patterns having two different wavelengths ?1 and ?2 (and thus<br>
different frequencies) which could be applied to a holoreaction system. Assume arguendo<br>
that the energy pattern of Figure 1a corresponds to an electromagnetic spectral pattern (or an<br>
electromagnetic spectral conditioning pattern) and that Figure 1b corresponds to one spectral<br>
environmental reaction condition (or a spectral conditioning environmental reaction<br>
condition). Each of the sine waves 1 and 2 has a different differential equation which<br>
describes its individual motion. However, when the sine waves are combined into the<br>
resultant additive wave 1+2 (Figure 1c), the resulting complex differential equation, which<br>
describes the totality of the combined energies (i.e., the applied spectral energy pattern; or the<br>
applied spectral energy conditioning pattern) actually results in certain of the input energies<br>
being high (i.e., constructive interference shown by a higher amplitude) at certain points in<br>
time, as well as being low (i.e., destructive interference shown by a lower amplitude) at<br>
certain points in time.<br><br>
Specifically, the portions "X" represent areas where the electromagnetic spectral<br>
pattern of wave 1 has constructively interfered with the spectral environmental reaction<br>
condition wave 2, whereas the portions "Y" represent areas where the two waves 1 and 2<br>
have destructively interfered. Depending upon whether the portions "X" corresponds to<br>
desirable or undesirable wavelengths, frequencies or energies (e.g., causing the applied<br>
spectral energy pattern (or the applied spectral energy conditioning pattern) to have positive<br>
or negative interactions with, for example, one or more participants and/or components in the<br>
holoreaction system), then the portions "X" could enhance a positive effect in the<br>
holoreaction system or could enhance a negative effect in the holoreaction system. Similarly,<br>
depending on whether the portions "Y" correspond to desirable or undesirable wavelengths,<br>
frequencies, or energies, then the portions "Y" may correspond to the effective loss of either<br>
a positive or negative effect.<br>
Further, if a source of, for example, electromagnetic radiation includes a somewhat<br>
larger spectrum of wavelengths or frequencies (i.e., energies) than those which are needed to<br>
optimize a particular reaction, then some of the unnecessary (or undesirable) wavelengths can<br>
be prevented from coming into contact with the holoreaction system (e.g., blocked, reflected,<br>
absorbed, etc.). Accordingly in the simplified example discussed immediately above, by<br>
permitting only desirable wavelengths ?1 to interact in a holoreaction system (e.g., filtering<br>
out certain wavelengths or frequencies of a broader spectrum electromagnetic emitter) the<br>
possibilities of negative effects resulting from the combination of waves 1 (Figure la) and 2<br>
(Figure 1b) would be minimized or eliminated. In this regard, it is noted that in practice<br>
many desirable incident wavelengths can be made to be incident on at least a portion of a<br>
holoreaction system. Moreover, it should also be clear that positive or desirable effects<br>
include, but are not limited to, those effects resulting from an interaction (e.g., heterodyne,<br>
resonance, additive wave, subtractive wave, constructive or destructive interference) between<br>
a wavelength or frequency of incident light and a wavelength (e.g., atomic and/or molecular,<br>
etc.), frequency or property (e.g., Stark effects, Zeeman effects, etc.) inherent to the<br>
holoreaction system itself. Thus, by maximizing the desirable wavelengths (or minimizing<br>
undesirable wavelengths), holoreaction system efficiencies never before known can be<br>
achieved. Alternatively stated, certain destructive interference effects resulting from the<br>
combinations of different energies, frequencies and/or wavelengths can reduce certain<br>
desirable results in a holoreaction system. The present invention attempts to mask or screen<br><br>
(e.g., filter) as many of such undesirable energies (or wavelengths) as possible (e.g., when a<br>
somewhat larger spectrum of wavelengths is available to be incident on a holoreaction<br>
system) from becoming incident on a holoreaction system and thus strive for, for example,<br>
the synergistic results that can occur due to, for example, desirable constructive interference<br>
effects between the incident wavelengths of, for example, electromagnetic energy.<br>
It should be clear from this particular analysis that constructive interferences (i.e., the<br>
points "X") could, for example, maximize both positive and negative effects in a holoreaction<br>
system. Accordingly, this simplified example shows that by combining, for example, certain<br>
frequencies from a spectral pattern (or a spectral conditioning pattern) with one or more other<br>
frequencies from, for example, at least one spectral environmental reaction condition (or at<br>
least one spectral environmental conditioning reaction condition), that the applied spectral<br>
energy pattern (or applied spectral energy conditioning pattern) that is actually applied to the<br>
holoreaction system can be a combination of constructive and destructive interference(s).<br>
The degree of interference can also depend on the relative phases of the waves. Accordingly,<br>
these factors should also be taken into account when choosing appropriate spectral energy<br>
patterns (or applied spectral energy conditioning patterns) that are to be applied to a<br>
holoreaction system. In this regard, it is noted that in practice many desirable incident<br>
wavelengths can be applied to a holoreaction system or undesirable incident wavelengths<br>
removed from a source which is incident upon at least a portion of a holoreaction).<br>
Moreover, it should also be clear that wave interaction effects include, but are not limited to,<br>
heterodyning, direct resonance, indirect resonance, additive waves, subtractive waves,<br>
constructive or destructive interference, etc. Further, as discussed in detail later herein,<br>
additional effects such as electric effects and/or magnetic field effects can also influence<br>
spectral energy patterns or spectral energy conditioning patterns (e.g., spectral patterns or<br>
spectral conditioning patterns).<br>
II. SPECTRAL CATALYSTS, SPECTRAL CONDITIONING CATALYSTS AND<br>
SPECTROSCOPY<br>
A wide variety of reactions can be advantageously affected and directed with the<br>
assistance of a spectral energy catalyst (or spectral energy conditioning catalyst) having a<br>
specific spectral energy pattern (e.g., spectral pattern or electromagnetic pattern) which<br>
transfers targeted energy to initiate, control and/or promote desirable reaction pathways (e.g.,<br>
desirable reaction pathways in a single or multiple component reaction system) and/or<br>
desirable reaction rates within a reaction system. This section discusses spectral catalysts<br>
(and spectral conditioning catalysts) in more detail and explains various techniques for using<br>
spectral catalysts (and/or spectral conditioning catalysts) in various holoreaction systems.<br>
For example, a spectral catalyst can be used in a reaction system to replace and provide the<br>
additional energy normally supplied by a physical catalyst. The spectral catalyst can actually<br>
mimic or copy the mechanisms of action of a physical catalyst. The spectral catalyst can act<br>
as both a positive catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction or as a negative catalyst or poison<br>
to decrease the rate of reaction. Furthermore, the spectral catalyst can augment a physical<br>
catalyst by utilizing both a physical catalyst and a spectral catalyst to achieve, for example a<br>
desired reaction pathway in a reaction system. The spectral catalyst can improve the activity<br>
of a physical chemical catalyst. Also, the spectral catalyst can partially replace a specific<br>
quantity or amount of the physical catalyst, thereby reducing and/or eliminating many of the<br>
difficulties associated with, various processing difficulties in numerous reactions.<br>
Moreover, a conditionable participant can be conditioned by a spectral conditioning<br>
catalyst to form a conditioned participant, which can thereafter be used in a reaction system,<br>
alone or in combination with a spectral catalyst. The spectral conditioning catalyst can cause<br>
a conditionable participant to result in a conditioned participant which can likewise, for<br>
example, replace, augment or otherwise provide additional energy normally provided by a<br>
physical catalyst in a reaction system, as discussed immediately above with regard to a<br>
spectral catalyst.<br>
Further, in the present invention, the spectral energy catalyst provides targeted energy<br>
(e.g., electromagnetic radiation comprising a specific frequency or combination of<br>
frequencies), in a sufficient amount for a sufficient duration to initiate and/or promote and/or<br>
direct a chemical reaction (e.g., follow a particular reaction pathway). The total combination<br>
of targeted energy applied at any point in time to the reaction system is referred to as the<br>
applied spectral energy pattern. The applied spectral energy pattern may be comprised of a<br>
single spectral catalyst, multiple, spectral catalysts and/or other spectral energy catalysts as<br>
well. With the absorption of targeted energy into a reaction system (e.g., electro-magnetic<br>
energy from a spectral catalyst), a reactant may be caused to proceed through one or several<br>
reaction pathways including: energy transfer which can, for example, excite electrons to<br>
higher energy states for initiation of chemical reaction, by causing frequencies to match;<br>
ionize or dissociate reactants which may participate in a chemical reaction; stabilize reaction<br><br>
products; energize and/or stabilize intermediates and/or transients and/or activated complexes<br>
that participate in a reaction pathway; cause one or more components in a reaction system to<br>
have spectral patterns which at least partially overlap; altered energy dynamics of one or<br>
more components causing them to have altered properties; and/or altered resonant exchange<br>
of energy within the holoreaction system.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the spectral energy conditioning catalyst provides<br>
targeted conditioning energy (e.g., electromagnetic radiation comprising a specific frequency<br>
or combination of frequencies), in a sufficient amount for a sufficient duration to condition a<br>
conditionable participant to form a conditioned participant and to permit the conditioned<br>
participant to initiate and/or promote and/or direct a chemical reaction (e.g., follow a<br>
particular reaction pathway) once the conditioned participant is initiated or activated in the<br>
reaction system. The total combination of targeted conditioning energy applied at any point<br>
in time to the conditioning reaction system is referred to as the applied spectral energy<br>
conditioning pattern. The applied spectral energy conditioning pattern may be comprised of a<br>
single spectral conditioning catalyst, multiple spectral conditioning catalysts and/or other<br>
spectral energy conditioning catalysts. With the absorption of targeted conditioning energy<br>
into a conditioning reaction system (e.g., electromagnetic energy from a spectral conditioning<br>
catalyst), a conditioned participant may cause one or more reactants in a reaction system to<br>
proceed through one or several reaction pathways including: energy transfer which can for<br>
example, excite electrons to higher energy states for initiation of chemical reaction, by<br>
causing frequencies to match; ionize or dissociate reactants which may participate in a<br>
chemical reaction; stabilize reaction products; energize and/or stabilize intermediates and/or<br>
transients and/or activated complexes that participate in a reaction pathway, cause one or<br>
more components in a reaction system to have spectral patterns which at least partially<br>
overlap; alter the energy dynamics of a component to affect its properties; and/or alter the<br>
resonant exchange of energy within a holoreaction system.<br>
For example, in a simple holoreaction system, if a chemical reaction provides for at<br>
least one reactant "A" to be converted into at least one reaction product "B", a physical<br>
catalyst "C" (or a conditioned participant "C") may be utilized. In contrast, a portion of the<br>
catalytic spectral energy pattern (e.g., in this section the catalytic spectral pattern) of the<br>
physical catalyst. "C" may be applied in the form of, for example, an electromagnetic beam<br>
(as discussed elsewhere herein) to catalyze the holoreaction.<br>
c<br>
A?B<br>
Substances A and B = unknown frequencies, and C = 30 Hz;<br>
Therefore, Substance A + 30 HZ? Substance B.<br>
In the present invention, for example, the spectral pattern (e.g., electromagnetic<br>
spectral pattern) of the physical catalyst "C" can be determined by known methods of<br>
spectroscopy. Utilizing spectroscopic instrumentation, the spectral pattern of the physical<br>
catalyst is preferably determined under conditions approximating those occurring in the<br>
holoreaction system using the physical catalyst (e.g., spectral energy patterns as well as<br>
spectral patterns can be influenced by environmental reaction conditions, as discussed later<br>
herein).<br>
Spectroscopy in general deals with the interaction of wave energies with matter.<br>
Spectroscopy is a process in which, typically, the energy differences between allowed states<br>
of any system are measured by determining the frequencies of the corresponding<br>
electromagnetic energy which is either being absorbed or emitted. When photons interact<br>
with, for example, atoms or molecules, changes in the properties of atoms and molecules are<br>
observed.<br>
Atoms and molecules are associated with several different types of motion. The<br>
entire molecule rotates, the bonds vibrate, and even the electrons move, albeit so rapidly that<br>
electron density distributions have historically been the primary focus of the prior art. Each<br>
of these kinds of motion is quantified. That is, the atom, molecule or ion can exist only in<br>
distinct states that correspond to discrete energy amounts. The energy difference between the<br>
different quantum states depends on the type of motion involved. Thus, the frequency of<br>
energy required to bring about a transition is different for the different types of motion. That<br>
is, each type of motion corresponds to the absorption of energy in different regions of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum and different spectroscopic instrumentation may be required for<br>
each spectral region. The total motion energy of an atom or molecule may be considered to<br>
be at least the sum of its electronic, vibrational and rotational energies.<br>
In both emission and absorption spectra, the relation between the energy change in the<br>
atom or molecule and the frequency of the electromagnetic energy emitted or absorbed is<br>
given by the so-called Bohr frequency condition:<br>
DE = hv<br>
where h is Planck's constant; v is the frequency; and AE, is the difference of energies in the<br>
final and initial states.<br>
Electronic spectra are the result of electrons moving from one electronic energy level<br>
to another in an atom, molecule or ion. A molecular physical catalyst's spectral pattern<br>
includes not only electronic energy transitions but also may involve transitions between<br>
rotational and vibrational energy levels. As a result, the spectra of molecules are much more<br>
complicated than those of atoms. The main changes observed in the atoms or molecules after<br>
interaction with photons include excitation, ionization and/or rupture of chemical bonds, all<br>
of which may be measured and quantified by spectroscopic methods including emission or<br>
absorption spectroscopy which give the same information about energy level separation.<br>
In emission spectroscopy, when an atom or molecule is subjected to a flame or an<br>
electric discharge, such atoms or molecules may absorb energy and become "excited." On<br>
their return to their "normal" state they may emit radiation. Such an emission is the result of<br>
a transition of the atom or molecule from a high energy or "excited" state to one of lower<br>
state. The energy lost in the transition is emitted in the form of electromagnetic energy.<br>
"Excited" atoms usually produce line spectra while "excited" molecules tend to produce band<br>
spectra.<br>
In absorption spectroscopy, the absorption of nearly monochromatic incident radiation<br>
is monitored as it is swept over a range of frequencies. During the absorption process the<br>
atoms or molecules pass from a state of low energy to one of high energy. Energy changes<br>
produced by electromagnetic energy absorption occur only in integral multiples of a unit<br>
amount of energy called a quantum, which is characteristic of each absorbing species.<br>
Absorption spectra may be classified into four types: rotational; rotation-vibration;<br>
vibrational; and electronic.<br>
The rotational spectrum of a molecule is associated with changes which occur in the<br>
rotational states of the molecule. The energies of the rotational states differ only by a<br>
relatively small amount, and hence, the frequency which is necessary to effect a change in the<br>
rotational levels is very low and the wavelength of electromagnetic energy is very large. The<br>
energy spacing of molecular rotational states depends on bond distances and angles. Pure<br>
rotational spectra are observed in the far infrared and microwave and radio regions (See<br>
Table 1).<br><br>
Rotation-vibrational spectra are associated with transitions in which the vibrational<br>
states of the molecule are altered and may be accompanied by changes in rotational states.<br>
Absorption occurs at higher frequencies or shorter wavelength and usually occurs in the<br>
middle of the infrared region (See Table 1).<br>
Vibrational spectra from different vibrational energy levels occur because of motion<br>
of bonds. A stretching vibration involves a change in the interatomic distance along the axis<br>
of the bond between two atoms. Bending vibrations are characterized by a change in the<br>
angle between two bonds. The vibrational spectra of a molecule are typically in the near-<br>
infrared range. It should be understood that the term vibrational spectra means all manner of<br>
bond motion spectra including, but not limited to. stretching, bending, librational,<br>
translational, torsional, etc.<br>
Electronic spectra are from transitions between electronic states for atoms and<br>
molecules and are accompanied by simultaneous changes in the rotational and vibrational<br>
states in molecules. Relatively large energy differences are involved, and hence absorption<br>
occurs at rather large frequencies or relatively short wavelengths. Different electronic states<br>
of atoms or molecules correspond to energies in the infrared, ultraviolet-visible or x-ray<br>
region of the electromagnetic spectrum (see Table 1).<br>
It should be understood that not all molecules absorb and emit electromagnetic energy<br>
at the same frequencies. For example, materials with color centers may absorb<br>
electromagnetic waves at one frequency, and emit them at a different frequency.<br>
Electromagnetic radiation as a form of energy can be absorbed or emitted, and<br>
therefore many different types of electromagnetic spectroscopy may be used in the present<br>
invention to determine a desired spectral pattern of a spectral catalyst (e.g., a spectral pattern<br>
of a physical catalyst) including, but not limited to, x-ray, ultraviolet, infrared, microwave,<br>
atomic absorption, flame emissions, atomic emissions, inductively coupled plasma, DC argon<br>
plasma, arc-source emission, spark-source emission, high-resolution laser, radio, Raman and<br>
the like.<br>
In order to study the electronic transitions, the material to be studied may need to be<br>
heated to a high temperature, such as in a flame, where the molecules are atomized and<br>
excited. Another very effective way of atomizing gases is the use of gaseous discharges.<br><br>
When a gas is placed between charged electrodes, causing an electrical field, electrons are<br>
liberated from the electrodes and from the gas atoms themselves and may form a plasma or<br>
plasma-like conditions. These electrons will collide with the gas atoms which will be<br>
atomized, excited or ionized. By using high frequency fields, it is possible to induce gaseous<br>
discharges without using electrodes. By varying the field strength, the excitation energy can<br>
be varied. In the case of a solid material, excitation by electrical spark or arc can be used. In<br>
the spark or arc, the material to be analyzed is evaporated and the atoms are excited.<br>
The basic scheme of an emission spectrophotometer includes a purified silica cell<br>
containing the sample which is to be excited. The radiation of the sample passes through a<br>
slit and is separated into a spectrum by means of a dispersion element. The spectral pattern<br>
can be detected on a screen, photographic film or by a detector.<br>
Typically, an atom will most strongly absorb electromagnetic energy at the same<br>
frequencies it emits. Measurements of absorption are often made so that electromagnetic<br>
radiation that is emitted from a source passes through a wavelength-limiting device, and<br>
impinges upon the physical catalyst sample that is held in a cell. When a beam of white light<br>
passes through a material, selected frequencies from the beam are absorbed. The<br>
electromagnetic radiation that is not absorbed by the physical catalyst passes through the cell<br>
and strikes a detector. When the remaining beam is spread out in a spectrum, the frequencies<br>
that were absorbed show up as dark lines in the otherwise continuous spectrum. The position<br>
of these dark lines correspond exactly to the positions of lines in an emission spectrum of the<br>
same molecule or atom. Both emission and absorption spectrophotometers are available<br>
through regular commercial channels.<br>
In 1885, Balmer discovered that hydrogen vibrates and produces energy at<br>
frequencies in the visible light region of the electromagnetic spectrum which can be<br>
expressed by a simple formula:<br>
l/? = R (1/22 - 1/m2)<br>
when X is the wavelength of the light, R is Rydberg's constant and m is an integer greater<br>
than or equal to 3 (e.g., 3. 4, or 5, etc.). Subsequently, Rydberg discovered that this equation<br>
could be adapted, to result in all the wavelengths in the hydrogen spectrum by changing the<br>
1/22 to 1/n2, as in,<br>
1/? = R (1/n2 - 1/m2)<br>
where n is an integer = 1, and m is an integer = n+1. Thus, for every different number n, the<br>
result is a series of numbers for wavelength, and the names of various scientists were<br>
assigned to each such series which resulted. For instance, when n=2 and m = 3, the energy is<br>
in the visible light spectrum and the series is referred to as the Balmer series. The Lyman<br>
series is in the ultraviolet spectrum with n = 1, and the Paschen series is in the infrared<br>
spectrum with n = 3.<br>
In the prior art, energy level diagrams were the primary means used to describe<br>
energy levels in the hydrogen atom (see Figures 7a and 7b).<br>
After determining the electromagnetic spectral pattern of a desired catalyst (e.g., a<br>
physical catalyst), the catalytic spectral pattern may be duplicated, at least partially, and<br>
applied to the reaction system. Any generator of one or more frequencies within an<br>
acceptable approximate range of, for example, frequencies of electromagnetic radiation may<br>
be used in the present invention. When duplicating one or more frequencies of, for example,<br>
a spectral pattern (or a spectral conditioning pattern), it is not necessary to duplicate the<br>
frequency exactly. For instance, the effect achieved by a frequency of 1,000 THz, can also be<br>
achieved by a frequency very close to it, such as 1,001 or 999 THz. Thus, there will be a<br>
range above and below each exact frequency which will also catalyze a reaction.<br>
Specifically, Figure 12 shows a typical bell-curve "B" distribution of frequencies around the<br>
desired frequency fo, wherein desirable frequencies can be applied which do not correspond<br>
exactly to fo, but are close enough to the frequency fo to achieve a desired effect, such as<br>
those frequencies between and including the frequencies within the range of f1 and f2. Note<br>
that f1 and f2 correspond to about one half the maximum amplitude, amax, of the curve "B".<br>
Thus, whenever the term "exact" or specific reference to "frequency" or the like is used, it<br>
should be understood to have this meaning. In addition, harmonics of spectral catalyst (or<br>
spectral conditioning catalyst) frequencies, both above and below the exact spectral catalyst<br>
frequency (or spectral conditioning catalyst frequency), will cause sympathetic resonance<br>
with the exact frequency and will catalyze the reaction. Finally, it is possible to catalyze<br>
reactions by duplicating one or more of the mechanisms of action of the exact frequency,<br>
rather than using the exact frequency itself. For example, platinum catalyzes the formation of<br>
water from hydrogen and oxygen, in part, by energizing the hydroxyl radical at its frequency<br>
of roughly 1,060 THz. The desired reaction can also be catalyzed by energizing the hydroxy<br>
radical with its microwave frequency, thereby duplicating platinum's mechanism of action.<br>
An electromagnetic radiation-emitting source should have the following<br>
characteristics: high intensity of the desired wavelengths; long life; stability; and the ability to<br>
emit the electromagnetic energy in a pulsed and/or continuous mode. Moreover, in certain<br>
holoreaction systems, it may be desirable for the electromagnetic energy emitted to be<br>
capable of being directed to an appropriate point (or area) within at least a portion of the<br>
reaction system. Suitable techniques include optical waveguides, optical fibers, etc.<br>
Irradiating sources can include, but are not limited to, arc lamps, such as xenon-arc,<br>
hydrogen and deuterium, krypton-arc, high-pressure mercury, platinum, silver; plasma arcs,<br>
discharge lamps, such as As, Bi, Cd, Cs, Ge, Hg, K, Na, P, Pb, Rb, Sb, Se, Sn, Ti, Tl and Zn;<br>
hollow-cathode lamps, either single or multiple elements such as Cu, Pt, and Ag; and sunlight<br>
and coherent electromagnetic energy emissions, such as masers and lasers. A more complete<br>
list of irradiating sources are listed in Table D.<br>
Masers are devices which amplify or generate electromagnetic energy waves with<br>
great stability and accuracy. Masers operate on the same principal as lasers, but produce<br>
electro-magnetic energy in the radio and microwave, rather than visible range of the<br>
spectrum. In masers, the electromagnetic energy is produced by the transition of molecules<br>
between rotational energy levels.<br>
Lasers are powerful coherent photon sources that produce a beam of photons having<br>
the same frequency, phase and direction, that is, a beam of photons that travel exactly alike.<br>
Accordingly, for example, the predetermined spectral pattern of a desired catalyst can be<br>
generated by a series or grouping of lasers producing one or more required frequencies.<br>
Any laser capable of emitting the necessary electromagnetic radiation with a<br>
frequency or frequencies of the spectral energy provider may be used in the present<br>
invention. Lasers are available for use throughout much of the spectral range. They can be<br>
operated in either a continuous or a pulsed mode. Lasers that emit lines and lasers that emit a<br>
continuum may be used in the present invention. Line sources may include argon ion laser,<br>
ruby laser, the nitrogen laser, the Nd:YAG laser, the carbon dioxide laser, the carbon<br>
monoxide laser and the nitrous oxide-carbon dioxide laser. In addition to the spectral lines<br>
that are emitted by lasers, several other lines are available, by addition or subtraction in a<br>
crystal of the frequency emitted by one laser to or from that emitted by another laser.<br>
Devices that combine frequencies and may be used in the present invention include<br>
difference frequency generators and sum frequency mixers. Other lasers that may be used in<br>
this invention include, but are not limited to: crystal, such as Al2O3 doped with Cr 3+,<br>
Y3Al5O12 doped with Nd3+; gas, such as He-Ne, Kr-ion; glass, chemical, such as vibrationally<br>
excited HCL and HF; dye, such as Rhodamine 6G in methanol; and semiconductor lasers,<br>
such as Ga1-xAlxAs. Many models can be tuned to various frequency ranges, thereby<br>
providing several different frequencies from one instrument and applying them to the<br>
crystallization reaction system (See Examples in Table 2).<br>
The coherent light from a single laser or a series of lasers is simply brought to focus<br>
or introduced to the region of the holoreaction system where a desired reaction is to take<br>
place. The light source should be close enough to avoid a "dead space" in which the light<br>
does not reach the desired area in the holoreaction system, but far enough apart to assure<br>
complete incident-light absorption. Since ultraviolet sources generate heat, such sources may<br>
need to be cooled to maintain efficient operation. Irradiation time, causing excitation of one<br>
or more components in the holoreaction system, may be individually tailored for each<br>
reaction: some short-term for a continuous reaction with large surface exposure to the light<br>
source; or long light-contact time for other systems. In addition, exposure times and energy<br>
amplitudes or intensities may be controlled depending on the desired effect (e.g., altered<br>
energy dynamics, ionization, bond rupture, etc.).<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a spectral energy pattern (e.g., a spectral<br>
pattern of electromagnetic energy) to one or more reactants in a reaction system by applying<br>
at least a portion of (or substantially all of) a required spectral energy catalyst (e.g., a spectral<br>
catalyst) determined and calculated by, for example, waveform analysis of the spectral<br>
patterns of, for example, the reactant(s) and the reaction product(s). Accordingly, in the case<br>
of a spectral catalyst, a calculated electromagnetic pattern will be a spectral pattern or will act<br>
as a spectral catalyst to generate a preferred reaction pathway and/or preferred reaction rate.<br>
In basic terms, spectroscopic data for identified substances can be used to perform a simple<br>
waveform calculation to arrive at, for example, the correct electromagnetic energy frequency,<br>
or combination of frequencies, needed to catalyze a reaction. In simple terms,<br>
A ? B<br>
Substance A = 50 Hz, and Substance B = 80 Hz<br>
80 Hz - 50 Hz = 30 Hz:<br>
Therefore, Substance A + 30 Hz ? Substance B.<br>
The spectral energy pattern (e.g., spectral patterns) of both the reactant(s) and reaction<br>
product(s) can be determined. In the case of a spectral catalyst, this can be accomplished by<br>
the spectroscopic means mentioned earlier. Once the spectral patterns are determined (e.g.,<br>
having a specific frequency or combination of frequencies) within an appropriate set of<br>
environmental reaction conditions, the spectral energy pattern(s) (e.g., electromagnetic<br>
conditioning spectral pattern(s)) of the spectral energy catalyst (e.g., spectral conditioning<br>
catalyst) can be determined. Using the spectral energy pattern (s) (e.g., spectral patterns) of<br><br>
the reactant(s) and reaction product(s), a waveform analysis calculation can determine the<br>
energy difference between the reactant(s) and reaction product(s) and at least a portion of the<br>
calculated spectral energy pattern (e.g., electromagnetic spectral pattern) in the form of a<br>
spectral energy pattern (e.g., a spectral pattern) of a spectral energy catalyst (e.g., a spectral<br>
catalyst) can be applied to the desired reaction in a reaction system to cause the desired<br>
reaction to follow along the desired reaction pathway. The specific frequency or frequencies<br>
of the calculated spectral energy pattern (e.g., spectral pattern) corresponding to the spectral<br>
energy catalyst (e.g., spectral catalyst) will provide the necessary energy input into the<br>
desired reaction in the reaction system to affect and initiate a desired reaction pathway.<br>
Performing the waveform analysis calculation to arrive at, for example, the correct<br>
electromagnetic energy frequency or frequencies can be accomplished by using complex<br>
algebra, Fourier transformation or Wavelet Transforms, which is available through<br>
commercial channels under the trademark Mathematica® and supplied by Wolfram, Co. It<br>
should be noted that only a portion of a calculated spectral energy catalyst (e.g., spectral<br>
catalyst) may be sufficient to catalyze a reaction or a substantially complete spectral energy<br>
catalyst (e.g., spectral catalyst) may be applied depending on the particular circumstances.<br>
In addition, at least a portion of the spectral energy pattern (e.g., electromagnetic<br>
pattern of the required spectral catalyst) may be generated and applied to the reaction system<br>
by, for example, the electromagnetic radiation emitting sources defined and explained earlier.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a spectral energy conditioning pattern<br>
(e.g., a spectral conditioning pattern of electromagnetic energy) to one or more conditionable<br>
participants in a conditioning reaction system by applying at least a portion of (or<br>
substantially all of) a required spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e.g., a spectral<br>
conditioning catalyst) determined and calculated by, for example, waveform analysis of the<br>
spectral patterns of, for example, the conditionable participant and the conditioned<br>
participant. Accordingly, in the case of a spectral conditioning catalyst, a calculated<br>
electromagnetic conditioning pattern will be a spectral conditioning pattern which, when<br>
applied to a conditionable participant, will permit the conditioned participant to act as a<br>
spectral catalyst in a reaction system to generate a preferred reaction pathway and/or<br>
preferred reaction rate in a reaction system. In basic terms, spectroscopic data for identified<br>
substances can be used to perform a simple waveform calculation to arrive at, for example,<br>
the correct electromagnetic energy frequency, or combination of frequencies, needed to<br>
catalyze a reaction. In simple terms,<br>
Conditionable substance A = 50Hz, and Conditioned Substance B = 80 Hz<br>
80 Hz - 50 Hz = 30 Hz:<br>
Therefore, Substance A + 30 Hz ? Substance B.<br>
The spectral energy conditioning pattern (e.g., spectral conditioning pattern) of both<br>
the conditionable participant and the conditioned product can be determined. In the case of a<br>
spectral conditioning catalyst, this can be accomplished by the spectroscopic means<br>
mentioned earlier. Once the spectral patterns are determined (e.g., having a specific<br>
frequency or combination of frequencies) within an appropriate set of environmental reaction<br>
conditioning conditions, the spectral energy conditioning pattern(s) (e.g., electromagnetic<br>
spectral conditioning pattern(s)) of the spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e.g., spectral<br>
conditioning catalyst) can be determined. Using the spectral energy conditioning pattern(s)<br>
(e.g., spectral conditioning patterns) of the conditionable participant and the conditioned<br>
participant, a waveform analysis calculation can determine the energy difference between the<br>
conditionable participant and the conditioned participant and at least a portion of the<br>
calculated spectral energy conditioning pattern (e.g., electromagnetic spectral conditioning<br>
pattern) in the form of a spectral energy conditioning (e.g., a spectral conditioning pattern) of<br>
a spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e.g., a spectral conditioning catalyst) can be applied<br>
to the desired conditionable participant in a conditioning reaction system to subsequently<br>
result in a desired reaction in the reaction system once the conditioned participant is<br>
introduced and/or activated in the reaction system. The specific frequency or frequencies of<br>
the calculated spectral energy conditioning pattern (e.g., a spectral conditioning pattern)<br>
corresponding to the spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e.g., spectral conditioning<br>
catalyst) required to form a conditioned participant, will provide the necessary energy input<br>
into the desired reaction in the reaction system to affect and initiate a desired reaction<br>
pathway.<br>
Performing the waveform analysis calculation to arrive at, for example, the correct<br>
electromagnetic energy frequency or frequencies can be accomplished by using complex<br>
algebra, Fourier transformation or Wavelet Transforms, which is available through<br>
commercial channels under the trademark Mathematica® and supplied by Wolfram, Co. It<br><br>
should be noted that only a portion of a calculated spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e.g.,<br>
spectral conditioning catalyst) used to form a conditioned participant may be sufficient to<br>
catalyze a reaction or a substantially complete spectral energy conditioning catalyst (e.g.,<br>
spectral conditioning catalyst) used to form a conditioned participant may be applied<br>
depending on the particular circumstances in the holoreaction system.<br>
In addition, at least a portion of the spectral energy conditioning pattern (e.g.,<br>
electromagnetic pattern of the required spectral catalyst) may be generated and applied to the<br>
conditioning reaction system by, for example, the electromagnetic radiation emitting sources<br>
defined and explained earlier.<br>
The specific physical catalysts that may be replaced or augmented by a conditioned<br>
participant in the present invention may include any solid, liquid, gas or plasma catalyst,<br>
having either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalytic activity. A homogeneous physical<br>
catalyst is defined as a catalyst whose molecules are dispersed in the same phase as the<br>
reacting chemicals. A heterogeneous physical catalyst is defined as one whose molecules are<br>
not in the same phase as the reacting chemicals. In addition, enzymes which are considered<br>
biological catalysts are to be included in the present invention. Some examples of physical<br>
catalysts that may be replaced or augmented comprise both elemental and molecular<br>
catalysts, including, not limited to, metals, such as silver, platinum, nickel, palladium,<br>
rhodium, ruthenium and iron; semiconducting metal oxides and sulfides, such as N1O2, Zn),<br>
MgO, Bi2O3/MoO3, TiO2, SiTiO3, CdS, CdSe, SiC, GaP, Wo2 and MgO3; copper sulfate;<br>
insulating oxides such as Al2O3, SiO2 and MgO; and Ziegler-Natta catalysts, such as titanium<br>
tetrachloride, and trialkyaluminum.<br>
III. TARGETING<br>
The frequency and wave nature of energy has been discussed herein. Additionally,<br>
Section I entitled "Wave Energies" disclosed the concepts of various potential interactions<br>
between different waves. The general concepts of "targeting", "direct resonance targeting",<br>
"harmonic targeting" and "non-harmonic heterodyne targeting" (all defined terms herein)<br>
build on these and other understandings.<br>
Targeting has been defined generally as the application of a spectral energy provider<br>
(e.g., spectral energy catalyst, spectral catalyst, spectral energy pattern, spectral pattern,<br>
catalytic spectral energy pattern, catalytic spectral pattern, spectral environmental reaction<br>
conditions and applied spectral energy pattern) to a desired reaction in a reaction system. The<br><br>
application of these types of energies to a desired reaction can result in interaction(s) between<br>
the applied spectral energy provider(s) and matter (including all components thereof) in the<br>
reaction system. This targeting can result in at least one of direct resonance, harmonic<br>
resonance, and/or non-harmonic heterodyne resonance with at least a portion, for example, at<br>
least one form of matter in a reaction system. In this invention, targeting should be generally<br>
understood as meaning applying a particular spectral energy provider (e.g., a spectral energy<br>
pattern) to another entity comprising matter (or any component thereof) to achieve a<br>
particular desired result (e.g., desired reaction product and/or desired reaction product at a<br>
desired reaction rate). Further, the invention provides techniques for achieving such desirable<br>
results without the production of, for example, undesirable transients, intermediates, activated<br>
complexes and/or reaction products. In this regard, some limited prior art techniques exist<br>
which have applied certain forms of energies (as previously discussed) to various reactions.<br>
These certain forms of energies have been limited to direct resonance and harmonic<br>
resonance with some electronic frequencies and/or vibrational frequencies of some reactants.<br>
These limited forms of energies used by the prior art were due to the fact that the prior art<br>
lacked an adequate understanding of the spectral energy mechanisms and techniques<br>
disclosed herein. Moreover, it has often been the case in the prior art that at least some<br>
undesirable intermediate, transient, activated complex and/or reaction product was formed,<br>
and/or a less than optimum reaction rate for a desired reaction pathway occurred. The present<br>
invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by specifically targeting, for example,<br>
various forms of matter in a reaction system (and/or components thereof), with, for example,<br>
an applied spectral energy pattern. Heretofore, such selective targeting of the invention was<br>
never disclosed or suggested. Specifically, at best, the prior art has been reduced to using<br>
random, trial and error or feedback-type analyses which, although may result in the<br>
identification of a single spectral catalyst frequency, such approach may be very costly and<br>
very time-consuming, not to mention potentially unreproducible under a slightly different set<br>
of reaction conditions. Such trial and error techniques for determining appropriate catalysts<br>
also have the added drawback, that having once identified a particular catalyst that works,<br>
one is left with no idea of what it means. If one wishes to modify the reaction, including<br>
simple reactions using size and shape, another trial and error analysis becomes necessary<br>
rather than a simple, quick calculation offered by the techniques of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, whenever use of the word "targeting" is made herein, it should be<br>
understood that targeting does not correspond to undisciplined energy bands being applied to<br>
a reaction system; but rather to well defined, targeted, applied spectral energy patterns, each<br>
of which has a particular desirable purpose in, for example, a reaction pathway to achieve a<br>
desired result and/or a desired result at a desired reaction rate.<br>
IV. CONDITIONING TARGETING<br>
Conditioning targeting has been defined generally as the application of a spectral<br>
energy conditioning provider (e.g., spectral energy conditioning catalyst, spectral<br>
conditioning catalyst, spectral energy conditioning pattern, spectral conditioning pattern,<br>
catalytic spectral energy conditioning pattern, catalytic spectral conditioning pattern, spectral<br>
conditioning environmental reaction conditions and applied spectral energy conditioning<br>
pattern) to a conditionable participant to form at least one conditioned participant, prior to the<br>
conditioned participant becoming involved in (e.g., introduced into and/or activated in) a<br>
reaction system. The application of these types of conditioning energies to conditionable<br>
participants to form conditioned participants, prior to the conditioned participants being<br>
introduced to a reaction system, can result in interaction(s) between the conditioned<br>
participant matter, and the components(s) in the reaction system (including all components<br>
thereof) so that the conditioned matter can then initiate and/or direct desirable reaction<br>
pathways and/or desirable reaction rates within a reaction system. This conditioning<br>
targeting can result in at least one of direct conditioning resonance, harmonic conditioning<br>
resonance, and/or non-harmonic conditioning heterodyne resonance with at least a portion of,<br>
for example, at least one form of conditionable participant matter (of any form) to form<br>
conditioned participant matter, which is later introduced into, or activated in, a reaction<br>
system. In this invention, conditioning targeting should be generally understood as meaning<br>
applying a particular spectral energy conditioning provider (e.g., a spectral energy<br>
conditioning pattern) to another conditionable entity comprising conditionable matter (or any<br>
component thereof) to achieve a particular desired result (e.g., ultimately achieve a desired<br>
reaction product and/or desired reaction product at a desired reaction rate in the reaction<br>
system due to the conditioned matter being introduced into the reaction system.). It should be<br>
noted that introduction into the reaction system should not be construed as meaning only a<br>
physical introduction of a conditioned participant that has been conditioned in a conditioning<br>
reaction vessel, but should also be understood as meaning that a conditionable participant can<br>
be conditioned in situ in a reaction vessel (or the reaction vessel per se can be conditioned)<br>
and the reaction system is thereafter initiated, activated, or turned on (e.g., initiated by the<br>
application of, for example, temperature, pressure, etc.) once the conditioned participant is<br>
present in the reaction vessel. Thus, the invention provides techniques for achieving such<br>
desirable results without the production of, for example, undesirable transients, intermediates,<br>
activated complexes and/or reaction products by using a conditioned participant. In this<br>
regard, some limited prior art techniques exist which have applied certain forms of energies<br>
directly to reaction systems. These certain forms of energies directly applied to reaction<br>
systems have been limited to direct resonance and harmonic resonance with some electronic<br>
frequencies and/or vibrational frequencies of some reactants in the reaction system. These<br>
limited forms of energies used by the prior art were due to the fact that the prior ait lacked an<br>
adequate understanding of the spectral energy mechanisms and techniques disclosed herein.<br>
Moreover, it has often been the case in the prior art that at least some undesirable<br>
intermediate, transient, activated complex and/or reaction product was formed, and/or a less<br>
than optimum reaction rate for a desired reaction pathway occurred. The present invention<br>
overcomes the limitations of the prior art by specifically targeting, for example, various<br>
forms of conditionable matter (and/or components thereof) to form conditioned matter prior<br>
to the conditioned matter being involved with reactions in a reaction system. Heretofore,<br>
such selective conditioning targeting of the invention was never disclosed or suggested.<br>
Specifically, at best, the prior art has been reduced to using random, trial and error or<br>
feedback-type analyses in various reactions which, although may result in the identification<br>
of a single spectral energy conditioning provider, such approach may be very costly and very<br>
time-consuming, not to mention potentially unreproducible under a slightly different set of<br>
reaction conditions and further, not to mention the simplicity of the application of a<br>
conditioning energy to a conditionable participant that eventually becomes involved in a<br>
reaction system. Such trial and error techniques for determining appropriate conditioning<br>
providers also have the added drawback, that having once identified a particular conditioning<br>
provider that works, one is left with no idea of what it means. If one wishes to modify the<br>
reaction, including simple reactions using size and shape, another trial and error analysis<br>
becomes necessary rather than a simple, quick calculation offered by the techniques of the<br>
present invention.<br>
 Accordingly, whenever use of the word "conditioning targeting" is made herein, it<br>
should be understood that conditioning targeting does not correspond to undisciplined energy<br>
bands being applied to a conditionable participant to form a conditioned participant which<br>
then becomes involved in a reaction system; but rather to well defined, targeted, applied<br>
spectral energy conditioning patterns, each of which has a particular desirable purpose to<br>
form a conditioned participant so that the conditioned participant can, for example, permit a<br>
desired reaction pathway to be followed, and/or achieve a desired result and/or a desired<br>
result at a desired reaction rate in a reaction system. These results include conditioning<br>
targeting a single form of conditionable participant matter to form conditioned matter which,<br>
when such conditioned matter is activated or initiated in a reaction system, causes the<br>
conditioned matter to behave favorably, or conditioning targeting multiple forms of<br>
conditionable participant matter to achieve desirable results.<br>
V. ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS<br>
Environmental reaction conditions are important to understand because they can<br>
influence, positively or negatively, reaction pathways in a reaction system. Traditional<br>
environmental reaction conditions include temperature, pressure, surface area of catalysts,<br>
catalyst size and shape, solvents, suppoit materials, poisons, promoters, concentrations,<br>
electromagnetic radiation, electric fields, magnetic fields, mechanical forces, acoustic fields,<br>
reaction vessel size, shape and composition and combinations thereof, etc<br>
The following reaction can be used to discuss the effects of environmental reaction<br>
conditions which may need to be taken into account in order to cause the reaction to proceed<br>
along the simple reaction pathway shown below.<br>
C<br>
a?b<br>
Specifically, in some instances, reactant A will not form into reaction product B in the<br>
presence of any catalyst C unless the environmental reaction conditions in the reaction<br>
system include certain maximum or minimum conditions of environmental reaction<br>
conditions such as pressure and/or temperature. In this regard, many reactions will not occur<br>
in the presence of a physical catalyst unless the environmental reaction conditions include,<br>
for example, an elevated temperature and/or an elevated pressure. In the present invention,<br>
such environmental reaction conditions should be taken into consideration when applying a<br>
particular spectral energy catalyst (e.g., a spectral catalyst). Many specifics of the various<br><br>
environmental reaction conditions are discussed in greater detail in the Section herein entitled<br>
'"Description of the Preferred Embodiments".<br>
VI. CONDITIONING ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS<br>
Conditioning environmental reaction conditions are also important to understand<br>
because they can also influence, positively or negatively, the energy dynamics and<br>
conditioning of a conditionable participant and can ultimately lead to different reaction<br>
pathways in a reaction system when a conditioned participant is introduced into, or activated<br>
in, the reaction system. The same traditional environmental reaction conditions listed above<br>
also apply here, namely temperature, pressure, surface area of catalysts, catalyst size and<br>
shape, solvents, support materials, poisons, promoters, concentrations, electromagnetic<br>
radiation, electric fields, magnetic fields, mechanical forces, acoustic fields, reaction vessel<br>
size, shape and composition and combinations thereof, etc.<br>
In the present invention, such conditioning environmental reaction conditions should<br>
be taken into consideration when applying a particular spectral energy conditioning catalyst<br>
(e.g., a spectral conditioning catalyst) to a conditionable participant. Similar environmental<br>
considerations to those discussed above need to be taken into account when the conditioned<br>
participant is introduced into a reaction system. Many specifics of the various environmental<br>
and/or conditioning environmental reaction conditions are discussed in greater detail in the<br>
Section herein entitled "Description of the Preferred Embodiments".<br>
VII. SPECTRAL ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS<br>
If it is known that certain reaction pathways will not occur within a reaction system<br>
(or not occur at a desirable rate) even when a catalyst is present unless, for example, certain<br>
minimum or maximum environmental reaction conditions are present (e.g., the temperature<br>
and/or pressure is/are elevated), then an additional frequency or combination of frequencies<br>
(i.e., an applied spectral energy pattern) can be applied to the reaction system. In this regard,<br>
spectral environmental reaction condition(s) can be applied instead of, or to supplement,<br>
those environmental reaction conditions that are naturally present, or need to be present, in<br>
order for a desired reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate to be followed. The<br>
environmental reaction conditions that can be supplemented or replaced with spectral<br>
environmental reaction conditions include, for example, temperature, pressure, surface area<br>
of catalysts, catalyst size and shape, solvents, support materials, poisons, promoters,<br>
concentrations, electric fields, magnetic fields, etc.<br><br>
Still further, a particular frequency or combination of frequencies and/or fields that<br>
can produce one or more spectral environmental reaction conditions can be combined with<br>
one or more spectral energy catalysts and/or spectral catalysts to generate an applied spectral<br>
energy pattern which can be focussed on a particular area in a reaction system. Accordingly,<br>
various considerations can be taken into account for what particular frequency or<br>
combination of frequencies and/or fields may be desirable to combine with (or replace)<br>
various environmental reaction conditions, for example.<br>
As an example, in a simple reaction, assume that a first reactant "A" has a frequency<br>
or simple spectral pattern of 3 THz and a second reactant "B" has a frequency or simple<br>
spectral pattern of 7 THz. At room temperature, no reaction occurs. However, when<br>
reactants A and B are exposed to high temperatures, their frequencies, or simple spectral<br>
patterns, both shift to 5 THz. Since their frequencies match, they transfer energy and a<br>
reaction occurs. By applying a frequency of 2 THz, at room temperature, the applied 2 THz<br>
frequency will heterodyne with the 3 THz pattern to result in, both 1 Thz and 5 THz<br>
heterodyned frequencies; while the applied frequency of 2 THz will heterodyne with the<br>
spectral pattern of 7 THz of reactant "B" and result in heterodyned frequencies of 5 THz and<br>
9 THz in reactant "B". Thus, the heterodyned frequencies of 5 THz are generated at room<br>
temperature in each of the reactants "A" and "B". Accordingly, frequencies in each of the<br>
reactants match and thus energy can transfer between the reactants "A" and "B". When the<br>
energy can transfer between such reactants, all desirable reactions along a reaction pathway<br>
may be capable of being achieved. However, in certain reactions, only some desirable<br>
reactions along a reaction pathway are capable of being achieved by the application of a<br>
singular frequency. In these instances, additional frequencies and/or fields may need to be<br>
applied to result in all desirable steps along a reaction pathway being met, including but not<br>
limited to, the formation of all required reaction intermediates and/or transients.<br>
Thus, by applying a frequency, or combination of frequencies and/or fields (i.e.,<br>
creating an applied spectral energy pattern) which corresponds to at least one spectral<br>
environmental reaction condition, the spectral energy patterns (e.g., spectral patterns of, for<br>
example, reactant(s), intermediates, transients, catalysts, etc.) can be effectively modified<br>
which may result in broader spectral energy patterns (e.g., broader spectral patterns), in some<br>
cases, or narrower spectral energy patterns (e.g., spectral patterns) in other cases. Such<br>
broader or narrower spectral energy patterns (e.g., spectral patterns) may correspond to a<br>
broadening or narrowing of line widths in a spectral energy pattern (e.g., a spectral pattern).<br>
As stated throughout herein, when frequencies match, energy transfers. In this particular<br>
embodiment, frequencies can be caused to match by, for example, broadening the spectral<br>
pattern of one or more participants in a reaction system. For example, as discussed in much<br>
greater detail later herein, the application of temperature to a reaction system typically causes<br>
the broadening of one or more spectral patterns (e.g., line width broadening) of, for example,<br>
one or more reactants in the reaction system. It is this broadening of spectral patterns that can<br>
cause spectral patterns of one or more reactants to, for example, overlap. The overlapping of<br>
the spectral patterns can cause frequencies to match, and thus energy to transfer. When<br>
energy is transferred, reactions can occur. The scope of reactions which occur, include all of<br>
those reactions along any particular reaction pathway. Thus, the broadening of spectral<br>
pattem(s) can result in, for example, formation of reaction product, formation of and/or<br>
stimulation and/or stabilization of reaction intermediates and/or transients, catalyst<br>
frequencies, poisons, promoters, etc. All of the environmental reaction conditions that are<br>
discussed in detail in the section entitled "Detailed Description of the Preferred<br>
Embodiments" can be at least partially simulated in a reaction system by the application of a<br>
spectral environmental reaction condition.<br>
Similarly, spectral patterns can be caused to become non-overlapping by changing,<br>
for example, at least one spectral environmental reaction condition, and thus changing the<br>
applied spectral energy pattern. In this instance, energy will not transfer (or the rate at which<br>
energy transfers can be reduced) and reactions will not occur (or the rates of reactions can be<br>
slowed).<br>
Finally, by controlling spectral environmental reaction conditions, the energy<br>
dynamics within a holoreaction system may be controlled. For example, with a first spectral<br>
environmental reaction condition, a first set of frequencies may match and hence energy may<br>
transfer at a first set of energy levels and types. When the spectral environmental reaction<br>
condition is changed, a second set of frequencies may match, resulting in transfer of energy at<br>
different levels or types.<br>
Spectral environmental reaction conditions can be utilized to start and/or stop<br>
reactions in a reaction pathway. Thus, certain reactions can be started, stopped, slowed<br>
and/or speeded up by, for example, applying different spectral environmental reaction<br>
conditions at different times during a reaction and/or at different intensities. Thus, spectral<br><br>
environmental reaction conditions are capable of influencing, positively or negatively,<br>
reaction pathways and/or reaction rates in a reaction system.<br>
VIII. SPECTRAL CONDITIONING ENVIRONMENTAL REACTION CONDITIONS<br>
Similarly, spectral conditioning environmental reaction conditions considerations<br>
apply in a parallel manner in this section as well. Specifically, if it is known that certain<br>
conditioning of a conditioned participant will not occur (or not occur at a desirable rate),<br>
unless for example, certain minimum or maximum conditioning environmental reaction<br>
conditions are present (e.g., the temperature and/or pressure is/are elevated), then an<br>
additional frequency or combination of frequencies (i.e., an applied spectral energy<br>
conditioning pattern) can be applied to the conditionable participant. In this regard, spectral<br>
conditioning environmental reaction condition(s) can be applied instead of, or to supplement,<br>
those conditioning environmental reaction conditions that are naturally present, or need to be<br>
present, in order for a desired conditioning of a conditionable participant to occur (i.e., to<br>
form a desired conditioned participant). The conditioning environmental reaction conditions<br>
that can be supplemented or replaced with spectral conditioning environmental reaction<br>
conditions include, for example, temperature, pressure, surface area of catalysts, catalyst size<br>
and shape, solvents, support materials, poisons, promoters, concentrations, electric fields,<br>
magnetic fields, etc.<br>
Still further, a particular frequency or combination of frequencies and/or fields that<br>
can produce one or more spectral conditioning environmental reaction conditions can be<br>
combined with one or more spectral energy conditioning catalysts and/or spectral<br>
conditioning catalysts to generate an applied spectral energy conditioning pattern.<br>
Accordingly, various considerations can be taken into account for what particular frequency<br>
or combination of frequencies and/or fields may be desirable to combine with (or replace)<br>
various conditioning environmental reaction conditions, for example.<br>
Thus, by applying a frequency, or combination of frequencies and/or fields (i.e.,<br>
creating an applied spectral energy conditioning pattern) which corresponds to at least one<br>
spectral environmental conditioning reaction condition, the spectral energy conditioning<br>
patterns of a conditionable participant can be effectively modified which may result in<br>
broader spectral energy conditioning patterns (e.g., broader spectral conditioning patterns), in<br>
some cases, or narrower spectral energy conditioning patterns (e.g., spectral conditioning<br>
patterns) in other cases. Such broader or narrower spectral energy conditioning patterns (e.g.,<br><br>
spectral conditioning patterns) may correspond to a broadening or narrowing of line widths in<br>
a spectral conditioning energy pattern (e.g., a spectral conditioning pattern). As stated<br>
throughout herein, when frequencies match, energy transfers. In this particular embodiment,<br>
frequencies can be caused to match by, for example, broadening the spectral conditioning<br>
pattern of one or more participants in a holoreaction system. For example, as discussed in<br>
much greater detail later herein, the application of temperature to a conditioning reaction<br>
system typically causes the broadening of one or more spectral conditioning patterns (e.g.,<br>
line width broadening) of, for example, one or more conditionable participants in a<br>
conditioning reaction system. It is this broadening of spectral conditioning patterns that can<br>
cause spectral conditioning patterns of one or more constituents in a conditioning reaction<br>
system to, for example, overlap. The overlapping of the spectral conditioning patterns can<br>
cause frequencies to match, and thus energy to transfer to result in a conditioned participant.<br>
The same conditionable participant may be conditioned with different spectral energy<br>
patterns or amounts to result in conditioned participants with different energy dynamics (e.g.,<br>
energized electronic level versus energized rotation). The scope of reactions which occur<br>
once a conditioned participant is introduced into a reaction system, include all of those<br>
reactions along any particular reaction pathway. Thus, the broadening of spectral conditioned<br>
pattern(s) in a conditioned participant can result in, for example, formation of reaction<br>
product, formation of and/or stimulation and/or stabilization of reaction intermediates and/or<br>
transients, catalyst frequencies, poisons, promoters, etc., in a reaction system. All of the<br>
conditioning environmental reaction conditions that are discussed in detail in the section<br>
entitled "Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments" can be at least partially<br>
simulated in a conditioning reaction system by the application of a spectral conditioning<br>
environmental reaction condition.<br>
Spectral conditioning environmental reaction conditions can be utilized to start direct,<br>
contain and/or appropriately condition a conditionable participant so that the conditioned<br>
participant can stop reactions or reaction pathways in a reaction system. Thus, certain<br>
reactions can be started, stopped, slowed and/or speeded up in a reaction system by. for<br>
example, applying different spectral conditioning environmental reaction conditions to a<br>
conditionable participant and introducing the conditioned participant into a reaction system at<br>
different times during a reaction and/or at different intensities. Thus, spectral conditioning<br>
environmental reaction conditions are capable of influencing, positively or negatively,<br>
reaction pathways and/or reaction rates in a reaction system by providing different spectral<br>
energy patterns in one or more conditioned participants.<br>
IX. DESIGNING PHYSICAL AND SPECTRAL CATALYSTS<br>
Moreover, by utilizing the above techniques to design (e.g., calculate or determine) a<br>
desirable spectral energy pattern, such as a desirable spectral pattern for a spectral energy<br>
catalyst rather than applying the spectral energy catalyst (e.g., spectral catalyst) per se, for<br>
example, the designed spectral pattern can be used to design and/or determine an optimum<br>
physical and/or spectral catalyst that could be used in the reaction system to obtain a<br>
particular result. Further, the invention may be able to provide a recipe for a physical and/or<br>
spectral catalyst for a particular reaction where no catalyst previously existed. For example in<br>
a reaction where:<br>
A?I?B<br>
where A = reactant, B = product and I = known intermediate, and there is no known catalyst,<br>
either a physical or spectral catalyst could be designed which, for example, resonates with the<br>
intermediate "I", thereby catalyzing the formation of one or more desirable reaction<br>
produces).<br>
As a first step, the designed spectral pattern could be compared to known spectral<br>
patterns for existing materials to determine if similarities exist between the designed spectral<br>
pattern and spectral patterns of known materials. If the designed spectral pattern at least<br>
partially matches against a spectral pattern of a known material, then it is possible to utilize<br>
the known material as a physical catalyst to obtain a desired reaction and/or desired reaction<br>
pathway or rate in a reaction system. In this regard, it may be desirable to utilize the known<br>
material alone or in combination with a spectral energy catalyst and/or a spectral catalyst.<br>
Still further, it may be possible to utilize environmental reaction conditions and/or spectral<br>
environmental reaction conditions to cause the known material to behave in a manner which<br>
is even closer to the designed energy pattern or spectral pattern. Further, the application of<br>
different spectral energy patterns may cause the designed catalyst to behave in different<br>
manners, such as, for example, encouraging a first reaction pathway with the application of a<br>
first spectral energy pattern and encouraging a second reaction pathway with the application<br>
of a second spectral energy pattern. Likewise, the changing of one or more environmental<br>
reaction conditions could have a similar effect.<br>
Further, this designed catalyst has applications in all types of reactions including, but<br>
not limited to, chemical (organic and inorganic), biological, physical, energy reactions, etc.<br>
Still further, in certain cases, one or more physical species could be used or combined<br>
in a suitable manner, for example, physical mixing or by a chemical reaction, to obtain a<br>
physical catalyst material exhibiting the appropriate designed spectral energy pattern (e.g.,<br>
spectral pattern) to achieve a desired reaction pathway. Accordingly, a combination of<br>
designed catalyst(s) (e.g., a physical catalyst which is known or manufactured expressly to<br>
function as a physical catalyst), spectral energy catalyst(s) and/or spectral catalyst(s) can<br>
result in a resultant energy pattern (e.g., which in this case can be a combination of physical<br>
catalyst(s) and/or spectral catalyst(s)) which is conducive to forming desired reaction<br>
product(s) and/or following a desired reaction pathway at a desired reaction rate. In this<br>
regard, various line width broadening and/or narrowing of spectral energy pattern(s) and/or<br>
spectral pattern(s) may occur when the designed catalyst is combined with various spectral<br>
energy patterns and/or spectral patterns.<br>
It is important to consider the energy interactions between all components involved in<br>
the desired reaction in a reaction system when calculating or determining an appropriate<br>
designed catalyst. There will be a particular combination of specific energy pattern(s) (e.g.,<br>
electromagnetic energy) that will interact with the designed catalyst to form an applied<br>
spectral energy pattern. The particular frequencies, for example, of electromagnetic radiation<br>
that should be caused to be applied to a reaction system should be as many of those<br>
frequencies as possible, when interacting with the frequencies of the designed catalyst, that<br>
can result in desirable effects to one or more participants in the reaction system, while<br>
eliminating as many of those frequencies as possible which result in undesirable effects<br>
within the reaction system.<br>
X. DESIGNING CONPITIONABLE PARTICIPANTS<br>
Moreover, by utilizing the above techniques to design (e.g., calculate or determine) a<br>
desirable spectral energy pattern, such as a desirable spectral pattern for a spectral energy<br>
catalyst (e.g., spectral catalyst) rather than applying the spectral energy catalyst (e.g., spectral<br>
catalyst) per se, for example, the designed spectral pattern can be achieved in a conditioned<br>
participant (e.g., appropriately conditioning a conditionable participant) which may function<br>
as an optimum physical and/or spectral catalyst that could be used in the reaction system<br>
when the conditioned participant is introduced into or activated m the reaction system.<br>
Further, the invention may be able to provide a recipe for a conditioned physical participant<br>
for a particular reaction system where no catalyst previously existed. For example in a<br>
reaction where:<br>
A? I? B<br>
where A = reactant, B = product and I = known intermediate, and there is no known catalyst,<br>
a conditionable physical participant could be conditioned which, for example, resonates with<br>
the intermediate "I", when the conditioned participant is, for example, introduced into the<br>
reaction system. Thus, the conditioned physical participant could catalyze the reaction when<br>
the conditioned physical participant is introduced to the reaction system.<br>
As a first step, the desired spectral pattern for resonating with known intermediate "I"<br>
could be compared to known spectral patterns for existing conditionable materials to<br>
determine if similarities exist between the desired spectral pattern and spectral patterns of<br>
known conditionable materials. If the desired spectral pattern at least partially matches<br>
against a spectral pattern of a known conditionable material, then it may be possible to<br>
condition the known conditionable material to form a conditioned material which then could<br>
function as, for example, a physical catalyst, in a reaction system. In this regard, it may be<br>
desirable to utilize the conditioned material(s) alone or in combination with a spectral energy<br>
catalyst and/or a spectral catalyst in a reaction system. Still further, it may be possible to<br>
utilize, environmental reaction conditions and/or spectral environmental reaction conditions to<br>
cause the conditioned material to behave in a manner which is even closer to the desired<br>
energy pattern or spectral pattern required in a reaction system. Further, the application of<br>
different spectral energy patterns may cause the conditioned material to behave in different<br>
manners, such as, for example, encouraging a first reaction pathway with the application of a<br>
first spectral energy pattern and encouraging a second reaction pathway with the application<br>
of a second spectral energy pattern once the conditioned material is introduced to the reaction<br>
system. Thus, various phases, compositions, products, etc., could be achieved from the same<br>
or similar reaction system(s) merely by altering the spectral energy conditioning pattern<br>
which is exposed to the conditionable participant prior to the conditionable participant being<br>
introduced into the reaction system as a conditioned participant. In addition, various<br>
desirable results may occur when the conditioned participant is introduced into the reaction<br>
system and thereafter various spectral energy patterns and/or spectral patterns are introduced<br>
into the reaction system along with the conditioned participant.<br>
Further, this designed conditioned participant has applications in all types of reactions<br>
including, but not. limited to, chemical (organic and inorganic), biological, physical, energy,<br>
etc.<br>
Still further, in certain cases, one or more physical species could be used or combined<br>
in a suitable manner, for example, physical mixing or by a chemical reaction, to obtain a<br>
physical conditionable material exhibiting the appropriate designed spectral energy<br>
conditioned pattern (e.g., once suitably conditioned) to achieve a desired reaction pathway<br>
once the conditioned matter is introduced into a reaction system. Accordingly, a combination<br>
of designed conditionable participant(s) (e.g., a physical conditionable material which is<br>
known or manufactured expressly to function as a physical catalyst once it is suitably targeted<br>
with a conditioning energy), spectral energy conditioning catalyst(s) and/or spectral<br>
conditioning catalyst(s) can result in a resultant conditioned energy pattern (e.g., which in this<br>
case can be a combination of physical material(s) and/or spectral conditioned catalyst(s))<br>
which is conducive to forming desired reaction product(s) and/or following a desired reaction<br>
pathway at a desired reaction rate once the conditioned material is introduced into the<br>
reaction system. In this regard, various line width broadening and/or narrowing of spectral<br>
energy pattem(s) and/or spectral pattem(s) may occur when the designed conditionable<br>
participant is combined with various spectral energy conditioning patterns and/or spectral<br>
conditioning patterns to form a conditioned participant.<br>
It is important to consider the energy interactions between all components of the<br>
holoreaction system when calculating or determining an appropriate designed conditionable<br>
participant. There will be a particular combination of specific energy pattern(s) (e.g.,<br>
electromagnetic energy) that will interact with the conditioned participant to result in an<br>
applied spectral energy pattern once the conditioned participant is introduced into the reaction<br>
system. The particular frequencies, for example, of electromagnetic radiation that should be<br>
caused to be applied to a conditioning reaction system should be as many of those<br>
frequencies as possible, when interacting with the frequencies of the conditionable<br>
participant, that can result in desirable effects in the reaction system when the conditioned<br>
participant is introduced therein, while eliminating as many of those frequencies as possible<br>
which result in undesirable effects within the reaction system.<br>
XI. SPECTRAL PHARMACEUTICALS<br>
Many pharmaceutical agents act as catalysts in biochemical reactions. While there<br>
are several types of exceptions, the effects of the preponderance of drugs result from their<br>
interaction with functional macromolecular components of the host organism. Such<br>
interaction alters the function of the pertinent cellular components and thereby initiates the<br>
series of biochemical and physiological changes that are characteristic of the response to the<br>
drug.<br>
A drug is usually described by its prominent effect or by the action thought to be the<br>
basis of that effect. However, such descriptions should not obscure the fact that no drug<br>
produces only a single effect. Morphine is correctly described as an analgesic, but it also<br>
suppresses the cough reflex, causes sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, bronchiolar<br>
constriction, release of histamine, antiduresis, and a variety of other side effects. A drug is<br>
adequately characterized only in terms of its full spectrum of effects and few drugs are<br>
sufficiently selective to be described as specific.<br>
One of the objects of this invention is to provide a more targeted mode for achieving a<br>
desired response from a biological system by introducing a spectral energy catalyst (e.g., a<br>
spectral catalyst) in place of, or to augment, pharmaceutical agents which may mimic the<br>
effect or mechanism of action of a given enzyme, and thereby, limit the occurrence of<br>
unwanted side effects commonly associated with pharmaceutical agents. Moreover, certain<br>
reactions can be achieved with spectral catalysts that are not achievable with any specific<br>
physical catalyst pharmaceutical.<br>
A first embodiment of this aspect of the invention involves DHEA and melatonin<br>
which are both pharmaceuticals thought to be involved in slowing and/or reversing the aging<br>
process. The electromagnetic spectral pattern for DHEA and melatonin could be emitted<br>
from light bulbs present in the home or the workplace. The resultant EM radiation can be<br>
absorbed directly into the central nervous system via the optic nerves and tracts, producing<br>
anti-aging effects at the site of the genesis of the aging phenomenon, namely, the central<br>
nervous system and the pineal-hypothalamus-pituitary system.<br>
A second embodiment of this aspect of the invention involves a lowering of LDL<br>
cholesterol levels with pharmaceutical spectral patterns emitted by, for example, coils in the<br>
mattress of a bed or in a mattress pad that negatively catalyzes HMG CoA reductase. Thus,<br>
desirable effects can be achieved by targeting appropriate biologies with unique spectral<br>
patterns designed to produce a desired reaction product.<br>
A third embodiment of this aspect of the invention involves the treatment of bacterial,<br>
fungal, parasitic, and viral illnesses using spectral pharmaceuticals. Specifically, by<br>
generating the catalytic spectral pattern of known drug catalysts, similar effects to physical<br>
drug catalysts can be achieved.<br>
Another embodiment of this aspect of the invention provides a treatment for asthma<br>
which involves the autonomic nervous system playing a key role in the control of<br>
bronchometer tone both in normal airways and in those of individuals with bronchospastic<br>
disease. The effects of the autonomic nervous system are thought to be mediated through<br>
their action on the stores of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and cyclic guanosine<br>
monophosphate (GMP) in bronchial smooth muscle cells. Further, acetylcholine, or<br>
stimulation by the vagus nerve, is thought to provide an increase in the amounts of cyclic<br>
GMP relative to cyclic AMP, leading to smooth muscle contraction and asthma attacks.<br>
Conversely, an increase within bronchial smooth muscle cells in the levels of cyclic AMP<br>
relative to cyclic GMP leads to relaxation of the bronchial muscles and thus provides a<br>
treatment for asthma. The enzyme, adenylate cyclase, catalyses the formation of cyclic AMP.<br>
Accordingly, by applying (e.g. a pendant worn around the neck) the catalytic spectral pattern<br>
for adenylate cyclase, relief from asthma could be achieved.<br>
Some of the most amazing physical catalysts are enzymes and antibodies which<br>
catalyze the multitudinous reactions in living organisms. Enzymes can increase the rate of<br>
biochemical reactions by factors ranging from 10b to 1012, and enzymes, as well as<br>
antibodies, are also highly specific. Enzymes and antibodies act only on certain molecules<br>
while leaving the rest of the system unaffected. Some enzymes have been found to have a<br>
high degree of specificity while others can catalyze a number of reactions. If a biological<br>
reaction can be catalyzed by only one enzyme, then the loss of activity or reduced activity of<br>
that enzyme could greatly inhibit the specific reaction and could be detrimental to a living<br>
organism. If this situation occurs, a catalytic spectral energy pattern could be determined for<br>
the exact enzyme or mechanism, then genetic deficiencies could be augmented by providing<br>
the spectral energy catalyst to replace the enzyme. Many enzymes contain active sites,<br>
typically, with metal atoms bonded in the active sites. It is not necessary to use the catalytic<br>
spectral energy pattern for the entire enzyme, but rather the spectral energy pattern for the<br>
active site, or a portion of it, may sufficiently catalyze the reaction.<br>
XII. SPECTRAL CONDITIONING FOR PHARMACEUTICALS<br>
Many pharmaceutical agents act as catalysts in biochemical reactions. While there<br>
are several types of exceptions, the effects of the preponderance of drugs result from their<br>
interaction with functional macromolecular components of the host organism. Such<br>
interaction alters the function of the pertinent cellular components and thereby initiates the<br>
series of biochemical and physiological changes that are characteristic of the response to the<br>

A drug is usually described by its prominent effect or by the action thought to be the<br>

One of the objects of this embodiment of the invention is to provide a more targeted<br>
mode for achieving a desired response from a biological system by introducing a spectral<br>
conditioning pattern (e.g., a spectral conditioning catalyst) to augment pharmaceutical agents,<br>
and thereby limit the occurrence of unwanted side effects commonly associated with<br>
pharmaceutical agents. Moreover, certain reactions can be achieved with conditioned<br>
participants that are not achievable with any specific physical catalyst pharmaceutical. For<br>
example, it may be possible to condition at least a portion of a biological organism prior to<br>
introducing a drug or treatment therapy into the biological system.<br>
XIII. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
All of the above information disclosing the invention should provide a comprehensive<br>
understanding of the main aspects of the invention. However, in order to understand the<br>
invention further, the invention shall now be discussed in terms of some of the representative<br>
objects or goals to be achieved.<br>
1. One object of this invention is to control or direct a reaction pathway in a reaction<br>
system by applying a spectral energy pattern in the form of a spectral catalyst having at least<br>
one electromagnetic energy frequency which may initiate, activate, and/or affect at least one<br>
of the participants involved in the reaction system.<br>
2. Another object of the invention is to provide an efficient, selective and economical<br>
process for replacing a known physical catalyst in a reaction system comprising the steps of:<br>
duplicating at least a portion of a spectral pattern of a physical catalyst (e.g., at least<br>
one frequency of a spectral pattern of a physical catalyst) to form a catalytic spectral pattern;<br>
and<br>
applying to at least a portion of the reaction system at least a portion of the catalytic<br>
spectral pattern.<br>
3. Another object of the invention is to provide a method to augment a physical<br>
catalyst in a reaction system with its own catalytic spectral pattern comprising the steps of:<br>

frequency can be applied by at least one of: (1) an electromagnetic wave guide: (2) an optical<br>
fiber array; (3) at least one element added to the reaction system which permits<br>
electromagnetic energy to be radiated therefrom; (4) an electric field; (5) a magnetic field;<br>
and/or (6) an acoustic field.<br>
4. Another object of the invention is to provide an efficient, selective and economical<br>
process for replacing a known physical catalyst in a reaction system comprising the steps of:<br>
duplicating at least a portion of a spectral pattern of a physical catalyst (e.g., at least<br>
one frequency of a spectral pattern of a physical catalyst) to form a catalytic spectral pattern;<br>
and<br>
applying to the reaction system at least a portion of the catalytic spectral pattern; and,<br>
applying at least one additional spectral energy pattern which forms an applied<br>
spectral energy pattern when combined with said catalytic spectral pattern.<br>
5. Another object of the invention is to provide a method to replace a physical catalyst<br>
in a reaction system comprising the steps of:<br>
determining an electromagnetic spectral pattern of the physical catalyst;<br>
duplicating at least one frequency of the electromagnetic spectral pattern of the<br>
physical catalyst with at least one electromagnetic energy emitter source to form a catalytic<br>
spectral pattern;<br>
applying to the reaction system at least one frequency of the catalytic spectral pattern;<br>
and<br>
applying at least one additional spectral energy pattern to form an applied spectral<br>
energy pattern, said applied spectral energy pattern being applied at a sufficient intensity and<br>
for a sufficient duration to catalyze the formation of at least one reaction product in the<br>
reaction system.<br>
6. Another object of this invention is to provide a method to affect and/or direct a<br>
particular reaction pathway in a reaction system with a spectral catalyst by augmenting a<br>
physical catalyst comprising the steps of:<br>
duplicating at least a portion of a spectral pattern of a physical catalyst (e.g., at least<br>
one frequency of a spectral pattern of the physical catalyst) with at least one energy emitter<br>
source to form a catalytic spectral pattern;<br>
applying to the reaction system, (e.g., irradiating) at least a portion of the catalytic<br>
spectral pattern (e.g., an electromagnetic spectral pattern having a frequency range of from<br>
about radio frequency to about ultraviolet frequency) at a sufficient intensity and for a<br>
sufficient duration to catalyze one or more particular reactions in the reaction system; and<br>
introducing the physical catalyst into the reaction system.<br>
The above method may be practiced by introducing the physical catalyst into the<br>
reaction system before, and/or during, and/or after applying said catalytic spectral pattern to<br>
the reaction system.<br>
7. Another object of this invention is to provide a method to affect and/or direct a<br>
particular reaction in a reaction system with a spectral energy catalyst by augmenting a<br>

participant in said reaction system to at least partially overlap with a spectral energy pattern<br>
of at least one other participant and/or component in said reaction system to permit the<br>
transfer of energy between the said conditioned participant and said participant and/or<br>
components, thereby causing the formation of said at least one reaction product.<br>
51. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for catalyzing a reaction<br>
system with a conditioned participant resulting in at least one reaction product comprising:<br>
applying at least one frequency and/or field to cause a conditioned spectral energy<br>
pattern (e.g., conditioned spectral pattern) broadening of said conditioned participant to cause<br>
a transfer of energy to occur between the conditioned participant and at least one participant<br><br>
in the holoreaction system, resulting in transformation (e.g., chemically, physically, phase or<br>
otherwise) of at least one participant and/or at least one component in said reaction system.<br>
In this regard, the transformation may result in a reaction product which is of a<br>
different chemical composition and/or different physical composition and/or phases than any<br>
of the chemical and/or physical compositions and/or phases of any starting reactant and/or<br>
conditioned participant. Thus, only transients may be involved in the conversion of a reactant<br>
into a reaction product.<br>
52. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for controlling a reaction<br>
and/or directing a reaction pathway by utilizing at least one conditioned participant and at<br>
least one spectral environmental reaction condition, comprising:<br>
forming a reaction system comprising said conditioned participant; and<br>
applying at least one spectral environmental reaction condition to direct said reaction<br>
system along a desired reaction pathway.<br>
In this regard, the applied spectral environmental reaction condition can be used alone<br>
or in combination with other environmental reaction conditions to achieve desired results.<br>
Further, additional spectral energy patterns may also be applied, simultaneously and/or<br>
continuously with said spectral environmental reaction condition.<br>
53. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for designing a<br>
conditionable participant to be used as a catalyst, once conditioned, in a reaction system<br>
where no catalyst previously existed (e.g., a physical catalyst and/or spectral energy catalyst),<br>
to be used in a reaction system, comprising:<br>
determining a required spectral pattern to obtain a desired reaction and/or desired<br>
reaction pathway and/or desired reaction rate; and<br>
designing a conditionable participant (e.g., material or combination of materials), that<br>
exhibit(s) a conditioned spectral pattern that approximates the required spectral pattern, when<br>
exposed to a suitable spectral energy conditioning pattern.<br>
In this regard, the designed conditionable participant may comprise a physical<br>
admixing of one or more materials and/or more materials that have been combined by an<br>
appropriate reaction, such as a chemical reaction. The designed conditionable participant<br>
material may be enhanced in function by one or more spectral energy conditioning patterns<br>
that may also be applied to the conditioning reaction system. Moreover, the application of<br>
different spectral energy conditioning patterns may cause the designed conditionable<br>
material, once conditioned, to behave in different manners in a reaction system, such as, for<br>
example, encouraging a first reaction pathway in a reaction system with the application of a<br>
first spectral energy conditioning pattern in a conditioning reaction system and encouraging a<br>
second reaction pathway in a reaction system with the application of a second spectral energy<br>
conditioning pattern in a conditioning reaction system. Likewise, the changing of one or<br>
more environmental conditioning reaction conditions could have a similar effect.<br>
Further, this designed conditionable participant or material has applications in all<br>
types of reactions (once conditioned) including, but not limited to, chemical (organic and<br>
inorganic), biological, physical, etc.<br>
54. It should be understood that in each of 29-53 Objects of the Invention, that<br>
reaction systems also include preventing certain reaction phenomena from occurring, when<br>
desirable.<br>
55. Another object of the invention is to use at least one conditioned participant with<br>
each of the techniques set forth in Objects 1-28 above; and to use at least one additional<br>
spectral energy pattern with each of the techniques set forth in Objects 29-54 above.<br>
In each of the above-mentioned 55 Objects of the Invention, the particular energy or<br>
energies can be applied by at least one of the following techniques: (1) a waveguide; (2) an<br>
optical fiber array; (3) at least one element added adjacent to, on and/or in at least one of the<br>
participants in a reaction system which permits energy t be radiated therefrom; and/or a<br>
transducer, etc.<br>
While not. wishing to be bound by any particular theory or explanation of operation, it<br>
is believed that when frequencies match, energy transfers. The transfer of energy can be a<br>
sharing of energy between two entities and, for example, a transfer of energy from one entity<br>
into another entity. The entities may both be, for example, matter, or one entity may be matter<br>
and the other energy (e.g. energy may be a spectral energy pattern such as electromagnetic<br>
frequencies, and/or an electric field and/or a magnetic field). Reactions and transformation of<br>
matter may be controlled and directed, by controlling the resonant exchange of energy within<br>
a holoreaction system.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In general, thermal energy is used to drive chemical reactions by applying heat and<br>
increasing the temperature. The addition of heat increases the kinetic (motion) energy of the<br>
chemical reactants. A reactant with more kinetic energy moves faster and farther, and is<br>
more likely to take part in a chemical reaction. Mechanical energy likewise, by stirring and<br>
moving the chemicals, increases their kinetic energy and thus their reactivity. The addition of<br>
mechanical energy often increases temperature, by increasing kinetic energy.<br>
Acoustic energy is applied to chemical reactions as orderly mechanical waves.<br>
Because of its mechanical nature, acoustic energy can increase the kinetic energy of chemical<br>
reactants, and can also elevate their temperature(s). Electromagnetic (EM) energy consists of<br>
waves of electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic en erg)' may also increase the kinetic<br>
energy and heat in holoreaction systems. It may energize electronic orbitals or vibrational<br>
motion in some reactions.<br>
Both acoustic and electromagnetic energy may consist of waves. The number of<br>
waves in a period of time can be counted. Waves are often drawn, as in Figure la. Usually,<br>
time is placed on the horizontal X-axis. The vertical Y-axis shows the strength or intensity of<br><br>
the wave. This is also called the amplitude. A weak wave will be of weak intensity and will<br>
have iow amplitude (see Figure 2a). A strong wave will have high amplitude (see Figure 2b).<br>
Traditionally, the number of waves per second is counted, to obtain the frequency.<br>
Frequency = Number of waves/time = Waves/second = Hz.<br>
Another name for "waves per second", is "hertz" (abbreviated "Hz"). Frequency is<br>
drawn on wave diagrams by showing a different number of waves in a period of time (see<br>
Figure 3a which shows waves having a frequency of 2 Hz and 3 Hz). It is also drawn by<br>
placing frequency itself, rather than time, on the X-axis (see Figure 3b which shows the same<br>
2 Hz and 3Hz waves plotted differently).<br>
Energy waves and frequency have some interesting properties, and may interact in<br>
some interesting ways. The manner in which wave energies interact, depends largely on the<br>
frequency. For example, when two waves of energy interact, each having the same<br>
amplitude, but one at a frequency of 400 Hz and the other at 100 Hz, the waves will add their<br>
frequencies, to produce a new frequency of 500 Hz (i.e., the "sum" frequency). The<br>
frequency of the waves will also subtract to produce a frequency of 300 HZ (i.e., the<br>
"difference" frequency). All wave energies typically add and subtract in this manner, and<br>
such adding and subtracting is referred to as heterodyning. Common results of heterodyning<br>
are familiar to most as harmonics in music.<br>
There is a mathematical, as well as musical basis, to the harmonics produced by<br>
heterodyning. Consider, for example, a continuous progression of heterodyned frequencies.<br>
As discussed above, beginning with 400 Hz and 100 Hz, the sum frequency is 500 Hz and the<br>
difference frequency is 300 Hz. If these frequencies are further heterodyned (added and<br>
subtracted) then new frequencies of 800 (i.e.. 500 + 300) and 200 (i.e., 500-300) are obtained.<br>
The further heterodyning of 800 and 200 results in 1,000 and 600 Hz as shown in Figure 4.<br>
A mathematical pattern begins to emerge. Both the sum and the difference columns<br>
contain alternating series of numbers that double with each set of heterodynes. In the sum<br>
column, 400 Hz, 800 Hz, and 1,600 Hz, alternates with 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz. The<br>
same sort of doubling phenomenon occurs in the difference column.<br>
Heterodyning of frequencies is the natural process that occurs whenever waveform<br>
energies interact. Heterodyning results in patterns of increasing numbers that are<br>
mathematically derived. The number patterns are integer multiples of the original<br>
frequencies. These multiples are called harmonics. For example, 800 Hz and 1600 Hz are<br>
harmonics of 400 Hz. In musical terms, 800 Hz is one octave above 400 Hz, and 1600 Hz is<br>
two octaves higher. It is important to understand the mathematical heterodyne basis for<br>
harmonics, which occurs in all waveform energies, and thus in all of nature.<br>
The mathematics of frequencies is very important. Frequency heterodynes increase<br>
mathematically in visual patterns (see Figure 5). Mathematics has a name for these visual<br>
patterns of Figure 5. These patterns are called fractals. A fractal is defined as a mathematical<br>
function which produces a series of self-similar patterns or numbers. Fractal patterns have<br>
spurred a great deal of interest historically because fractal patterns are found everywhere in<br>
nature. Fractals can be found in the patterning of large expanses of coastline, all the way<br>
down to microorganisms. Fractals are found in the behavior of organized insects and in the<br>
behavior of fluids. The visual patterns produced by fractals are very distinct and<br>
recognizable. A typical fractal pattern is shown in Figure 6.<br>
A heterodyne is a mathematical function, governed by mathematical equations, just<br>
like a fractal. A heterodyne also produces self-similar patterns of numbers, like a fractal. If<br>
graphed, a heterodyne series produces the same familiar visual shape and form which is so<br>
characteristic of fractals. It is interesting to compare the heterodyne series in Figure 5, with<br>
the fractal series in Figure 6.<br>
Heterodynes are fractals; the conclusion is inescapable. Heterodynes and fractals are<br>
both mathematical functions which produce a series of self-similar patterns or numbers.<br>
Wave energies interact in heterodyne patterns. Thus, all wave energies interact as fractal<br>
patterns. Once it is understood that the fundamental process of interacting energies is itself a<br>
fractal process, it becomes easier to understand why so many creatures and systems in nature<br>
also exhibit fractal patterns. The fractal processes and patterns of nature are established at a<br>
fundamental or basic level.<br>
Accordingly, since energy interacts by heterodyning, matter should also be capable of<br>
interacting by a heterodyning process. All matter whether in large or small forms, has what is<br>
called a natural oscillatory frequency. The natural oscillatory frequency ("NOF') of an<br>
object, is the frequency at which the object prefers to vibrate, once set in motion. The NOF<br>
of an object is related to many factors including size, shape, dimension, and composition.<br>
The smaller an object is, the smaller the distance it has to cover when it oscillates back and<br>
forth. The smaller the distance, the faster it can oscillate, and the higher its NOF.<br><br>
For example, consider a wire composed of metal atoms. The wire has a natural<br>
oscillatory frequency. The individual metal atoms also have unique natural oscillatory<br>
frequencies. The NOF of the atoms and the NOF of the wire heterodyne by adding and<br>
subtracting, just the way energy heterodynes.<br><br>
If the wire is stimulated with the Difference Frequencyatom-wire, the difference<br>
frequency will heterodyne (add) with the NOFwire to produce NOFatom, (natural oscillatory<br>
frequency of the atom) and the atom will absorb with the energy, thereby becoming<br>
stimulated to a higher energy level. Cirac and Zoeller reported this phenomenon in 1995, and<br>
they used a laser to generate the Difference Frequency.<br><br>
Matter heterodynes with matter in a manner similar to the way in which wave<br>
energies heterodyne with other wave energies. This means that matter in its various states<br>
may also interact in fractal processes. This interaction of matter by fractal processes assists<br>
in explaining why so many creatures and systems in nature exhibit fractal processes and<br>
patterns. Matter, as well as energy, interacts by the mathematical equations of heterodynes,<br>
to produce harmonics and fractal patterns. That is why there are fractals everywhere around<br>
us.<br>
Thus, energy heterodynes with energy, and matter heterodynes with matter.<br>
However, perhaps even more important is that matter can heterodyne with energy (and visa<br>
versa). In the metal wire discussion above, the Difference Frequencyatom-wire in the<br>
experiment by Cirac and Zoeller was provided by a laser which used electromagnetic wave<br>
energy at a frequency equal to the Difference Frequencyatom-wire. The matter in the wire, via<br>
its natural oscillatory frequency, heterodyned with the electromagnetic wave energy<br>
frequency of the laser to produce the frequency of an individual atom of matter. This shows<br>
that energy and matter do heterodyne with each other.<br>
In general, when energy encounters matter, one of three possibilities occur. The<br>
energy either bounces off the matter (i.e., is reflected energy), passes through the matter (i.e.,<br>
is transmitted energy), or interacts and/or combines with the matter (e.g., is absorbed or<br>
heterodynes with the matter). If the energy heterodynes with the matter, new frequencies of<br>
enevgy and/or matter will be produced by mathematical processes of sums and differences. If<br>
the frequency thus produced matches an NOF of the matter, the energy will be, at least<br>
partially, absorbed, and the matter will be stimulated to, for example, a higher energy level,<br>
(i.e., it possesses more energy). A crucial factor which determines which of these three<br>
possibilities will happen is the frequency of the energy compared to the frequency of the<br>
matter. If the frequencies do not match, the .energy will either be reflected, or will pass on<br>
through as transmitted energy. If the frequencies of the energy and the matter match either<br>
directly (e.g., are close to each other, as discussed in greater detail later herein), or match<br>
indirectly (e.g., heterodynes), then the energy is capable of interacting and/or combining with<br>
the matter.<br>
Another term often used for describing the matching of frequencies is resonance. In<br>
this invention, use of the term resonance will typically mean that frequencies of matter and/or<br>
energy match. For example, if the frequency of energy and the frequency of matter match,<br>
the energy and matter are in resonance and the energy is capable of combining with the<br>
matter. Resonance, or frequency matching, is merely an aspect of heterodyning that permits<br>
the coherent transfer and combination of energy with matter.<br>
In the example above with the wire and atoms, resonance could have been created<br>
with the atom, by stimulating the atom with a laser frequency exactly matching the NOF of<br>
the atom. In this case, the atom would be energized with its own resonant frequency and the<br>
energy would be transferred to the atom directly. Alternatively, as was performed in the<br>
actual wire/laser experiment, resonance could also have been created with the atom by using<br>
the heterodyning that naturally occurs between differing frequencies. Thus, the resonant<br>
frequency of the atom (NOFatom) can be produced indirectly, as an additive (or subtractive)<br>
heterodyned frequency, between the resonant frequency of the wire (NOFwire) and the applied<br>
frequency of the laser. Either direct resonance, or indirect resonance through heterodyned<br>
frequency matching, produces resonance and thus permits the combining of matter and<br>
energy. When frequencies match, energy transfers and amplitudes may increase.<br>
Heterodyning produces indirect resonance. Heterodyning also produces harmonics,<br>
(i.e., frequencies that are integer multiples of the resonant (NOF) frequency. For example,<br>
the music note "A" is approximately 440 Hz. If that frequency is doubled to about 880 Hz,<br>
the note "A" is heard an octave higher. This first octave is called the first harmonic.<br>
Doubling the note or frequency again, from 880 Hz to 1,760 Hz (i.e., four times the<br><br>
frequency of the original note) results in another "A", two octaves above the original note.<br>
This is called the third harmonic. Every time the frequency is doubled another octave is<br>
achieved, so these are the even integer multiples of the resonant frequency.<br>
In between the first and third harmonic is the second harmonic, which is three times<br>
the original note. Musically, this is not an octave like the first and third harmonics. It is an<br>
octave and a fifth, equal to the second "E" above the original "A". All of the odd integer<br>
multiples are fifths, rather than octaves. Because harmonics are simply multiples of the<br>
fundamental natural oscillatory frequency, harmonics stimulate the NOF or resonant<br>
frequency indirectly. Thus by playing the high "A" at 880 Hz on a piano, the string for<br>
middle "A" at 440 Hz should also begin to vibrate due to the phenomenon of harmonics.<br>
Matter and energy in chemical reactions respond to harmonics of resonant frequencies<br>
much the way musical instruments do. Thus, the resonant frequency of the atom (NOFatom)<br>
can be stimulated indirectly, using one or more of its' harmonic frequencies. This is because<br>
the harmonic frequency heterodynes with the resonant frequency of the atom itself (NOFatom).<br>
For example, in the wire/atom example above, if the laser is tuned to 800 THz and the atom<br>
resonates at 400 THz, heterodyning the two frequencies results in:<br>
800 THz - 400 THz = 400 THz<br>
The 800 THz (the atom's first harmonic), heterodynes with the resonant frequency of<br>
the atom, to produce the atom's own resonant frequency. Thus the first harmonic indirectly<br>
resonates with the atom's NOF, and stimulates the atom's resonant frequency as a first<br>
generation heterodyne.<br>
Of course, the two frequencies will also heterodyne in the other direction, producing:<br>
800 THz + 400 THz = 1,200 THz<br>
The 1,200 THz frequency is not the resonant frequency of the atom. Thus, part of the<br>
energy of the laser will heterodyne to produce the resonant frequency of the atom. The other<br>
part of the energy of the laser heterodynes to a different frequency, that does not itself<br>
stimulate, the resonant frequency of the atom. That is why the stimulation of an object by a<br>
harmonic frequency of particular strength of amplitude, is typically less than the stimulation<br>
by its' own resonant (NOF) frequency at the same particular strength.<br>
Although it appears that half the energy of a harmonic is wasted, that is not<br>
necessarily the case. Referring again to the exemplary atom vibrating at 400 THz, exposing<br><br>
the atom to electromagnetic energy vibrating at 800 THz will result in frequencies subtracting<br>
and adding as follows:<br>
800 THz - 400 THz = 400 THz<br>
and<br>
800 THz + 400 THz = 1,200 THz<br>
The 1,200 THz heterodyne, for which about 50% of the energy appears to be wasted,<br>
will heterodyne with other frequencies also, such as 800 THz. Thus,<br>
1,200 THz - 800 THz = 400 THz<br>
Also, the 1,200 THz will heterodyne with 400 THz:<br>
1,200 THz - 400 THz = 800 THz,<br>
thus producing 800 THz, and the 800 THz will heterodyne with 400 THz:<br>
800 THz - 400 THz = 400 THz,<br>
thus producing 400 THz frequency again. When other generations of heterodynes of the<br>
seemingly wasted energy are taken into consideration, the amount of energy transferred by a<br>
first harmonic frequency is much greater than the previously suggested 50% transfer of<br>
energy. There is not as much energy transferred by this approach when compared to direct<br>
resonance, but this energy transfer is sufficient to produce a desired effect (see Figure 14).<br>
As stated previously, Ostwald's theories on catalysts and bond formation were based<br>
on the kinetic theories of chemistry from the turn of the century. However, it should now be<br>
understood that chemical reactions are interactions of matter, and that matter interacts with<br>
other matter through resonance and heterodyning of frequencies; and energy can just as easily<br>
interact with matter through a similar processes of resonance and heterodyning. With the<br>
advent of spectroscopy (discussed in more detail elsewhere herein), it is evident that matter<br>
produces, for example, electromagnetic energy at the same or substantially the same<br>
frequencies at which it vibrates. Energy and matter can move about and recombine with<br>
other energy or matter, as long as their frequencies match, because when frequencies match,<br>
energy transfers. In many respects, both philosophically and mathematically, both matter and<br>
energy can be fundamentally construed as corresponding to frequency. Accordingly, since<br>
chemical reactions are recombinations of matter driven by energy, chemical reactions are in<br>
effect, driven just as much by frequency.<br>
Analysis of a typical chemical reaction should be helpful in understanding the normal<br>
processes disclosed herein. A representative reaction to examine is the formation of water<br><br>
from hydrogen and oxygen gases, catalyzed by platinum. Platinum has been known for some<br>
time to be a good hydrogen catalyst, although the reason for this has not been well<br>
understood.<br><br>
This reaction is proposed to be a chain reaction, depending on the generation and<br>
stabilization of the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates. The proposed reaction chain is:<br><br>
Generation of the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates are thought to be crucial to<br>
this reaction chain. Under normal circumstances, hydrogen and oxygen gas can be mixed<br>
together for an indefinite amount of time, and they will not form water. Whenever the<br>
occasional hydrogen molecule splits apart, the hydrogen atoms do not have adequate energy<br>
to bond with an oxygen molecule to form water. The hydrogen atoms are very short-lived as<br>
they simply re-bond again to form a hydrogen molecule. Exactly how platinum catalyzes this<br>
reaction chain is a mystery to the prior art.<br>
The present invention teaches that an important step to catalyzing this reaction is the<br>
understanding now provided that it is crucial not only to generate the intermediates, but also<br>
to energize and/or stabilize (i.e., maintain the intermediates for a longer time), so that the<br>
intermediates have sufficient energy to, for example, react with other components in the<br>
reaction system. In the case of platinum, the intermediates react with the reactants to form<br>
product and more intermediates (i.e., by generating, energizing and stabilizing the hydrogen<br>
intermediate, it has sufficient energy to react with the molecular oxygen reactant, forming<br>
water and the hydroxy intermediate, instead of falling back into a hydrogen molecule).<br>
Moreover, by energizing and stabilizing the hydroxy intermediates, the hydroxy<br>
intermediates can react with more reactant hydrogen molecules, and again water and more<br>
intermediates result from this chain reaction. Thus, generating energizing and/or stabilizing<br>
the intermediates, influences this reaction pathway. Paralleling nature in this regard would be<br>
desirable (e.g., nature can be paralleled by increasing the energy levels of the intermediates).<br>
Specifically, desirable, intermediates can be energized and/or stabilized by applying at least<br>
one appropriate electromagnetic frequency resonant with the intermediate, thereby<br>
stimulating the intermediate to a higher energy level. Interestingly, that is what platinum<br>
does (e.g., various platinum frequencies resonate with the intermediates on the reaction<br>
pathway for water formation). Moreover, in the process of energizing and stabilizing the<br>
reaction intermediates, platinum fosters the generation of more intermediates, which allows<br>
the reaction chain to continue, and thus catalyzes the reaction.<br>
As a catalyst, platinum takes advantage of many of the ways that frequencies interact<br>
with each other. Specifically, frequencies interact and resonate with each other: 1) directly,<br>
by matching a frequency; or 2) indirectly, by matching a frequency through harmonics or<br>
heterodynes. In other words, platinum vibrates at frequencies which both directly match the<br>
natural oscillatory frequencies of the intermediates, and which indirectly match their<br>
frequencies, for example, by heterodyning harmonics with the intermediates.<br>
Further, in addition to the specific intermediates of the reaction discussed above<br>
herein, it should be understood that in this reaction, like in all reactions, various transients or<br>
transient states also exist. In some cases, transients or transient states may only involve<br>
different bond angles between similar chemical species or in other cases transients may<br>
involve completely different chemistries altogether. In any event, it should be understood that<br>
numerous transient states exist between any particular combination of reactant and reaction<br>
product.<br>
It should now be understood that physical catalysts produce effects by generating,<br>
energizing and/or stabilizing all manner of transients, as well as intermediates. In this regard,<br>
Figure 8a shows a single reactant and a single product. The point "A" corresponds to the<br>
reactant and the point "B" corresponds to the reaction product. The point "C" corresponds to<br>
an activated complex. Transients correspond to all those points on the curve between<br>
reactant "A" and product "B", and can also include the activated complex "C".<br>
In a more complex reaction which involves formation of at least one intermediate, the<br>
reaction profile looks somewhat different. In this regard, reference is made to Figure Sb,<br>
which shows reactant "A", product "B", activated complex "C and C", and intermediate<br>
"D". In this particular example, the intermediate "D" exists as a minimum in the energy<br>
reaction profile of the reaction, while it is surrounded by the activated complexes C and C".<br>
However, again, in this particular reaction, transients correspond to anything between the<br>
reactant "A" and the reaction product "B", which in this particular example, includes the two<br>
activated complexes "C" and "C"," as well as the intermediate "D". In the particular<br>
example of hydrogen and oxygen combining to form water, the reaction profile is closer to<br>
that shown in Figure 8c. In this particular reaction profile, "D"' and "D"" could correspond<br>
generally to the intermediates of the hydrogen atom and hydroxy molecule.<br>
Now, with specific reference to the reaction to form water, both intermediates are<br>
good examples of how platinum produces resonance in an intermediate by directly matching<br>
a frequency. Hydroxy intermediates vibrate strongly at frequencies of 975 THz and 1,060<br>
THz. Platinum also vibrates at 975 THz and 1,060 THz. By directly matching the<br>
frequencies of the hydroxy intermediates, platinum can cause resonance in hydroxy<br>
intermediates, enabling them to be energized, stimulated and/or stabilized long enough to<br>
take part in chemical reactions. Similarly, platinum also directly matches frequencies of the<br>
hydrogen intermediates. Platinum resonates with about 10 out of about 24 hydrogen<br>
frequencies in its electronic spectrum (see Figure 69). Specifically, Figure 69 shows the<br>
frequencies of hydrogen listed horizontally across the Table and the frequencies of platinum<br>
listed vertically on the Table. Thus, by directly resonating with the intermediates in the<br>
above-described reaction, platinum facilitates the generation, energizing, stimulating, and/or<br>
stabilizing of the intermediates, thereby catalyzing the desired reaction.<br>
Platinum's interactions with hydrogen are also a good example of matching<br>
frequencies through heterodyning. It is disclosed herein, and shown clearly in Figure 69, that<br>
many of the platinum frequencies resonate indirectly as harmonics with the hydrogen atom<br>
intermediate (e.g., harmonic heterodynes). Specifically, fifty-six (56) frequencies of<br>
platinum (i.e., 33 % of all its frequencies) are harmonics of nineteen (19) hydrogen<br>
frequencies (i.e., 80% of its 24 frequencies). Fourteen (14) platinum frequencies are first<br>
harmonics (2X) of seven (7) hydrogen frequencies. And, twelve (12) platinum frequencies<br>
are third harmonics (4X) of four (4" hydrogen frequencies. Thus, the presence of platinum<br><br>
causes massive indirect harmonic resonance in the hydrogen atom, as well as significant<br>
direct resonance.<br>
Further focus on the individual hydrogen frequencies is even more informative.<br>
Figures 9-10 show a different picture of what hydrogen looks like when the same information<br>
used to make energy level diagrams is plotted as actual frequencies and intensities instead.<br>
Specifically, the X-axis shows the frequencies emitted and absorbed by hydrogen, while the<br>
Y-axis shows the relative intensity for each frequency. The frequencies are plotted in<br>
terahertz (THz, 1012 Hz) and are rounded to the nearest THz. The intensities are plotted on a<br>
relative scale of 1 to 1,000. The highest intensity frequency that hydrogen atoms produce is<br>
2,466 THz. This is the peak of curve I to the far right in Figure 9a. This curve I shall be<br>
referred to as the first curve. Curve I sweeps down and to the right, from 2,466 THz at a<br>
relative intensity of 1,000 to 3,237 THz at a relative intensity of only about 15.<br>
The second curve in Figure 9a, curve II, starts at 456 THz with a relative intensity of<br>
about 300 and sweeps down and to the right. It ends at a frequency of 781 THz with a<br>
relative intensity of five (5). Every curve in hydrogen has this same downward sweep to the<br>
right. Progressing from right to left in Figure 9, the curves are numbered I through V; going<br>
from high to low frequency and from high to low intensity.<br>
The hydrogen frequency chart shown in Figure 10 appears to be much simpler than<br>
the energy level diagrams. It is thus easier to visualize how the frequencies are organized<br>
into the different curves shown in Figure 9. In fact, there is one curve for each of the series<br>
described by Rydberg. Curve "I" contains the frequencies in the Lyman series, originating<br>
from what quantum mechanics refers to as the first energy level. The second curve from the<br>
right, curve "II", equates to the second energy level, and so on.<br>
The curves in the hydrogen frequency chart of Figure 9 are composed of sums and<br>
differences (i.e., they are heterodyned). For example, the smallest curve at the far left,<br>
labeled curve "V", has two frequencies shown, namely 40 THz and 64 THz; with relative<br>
intensities of six (6) and four (4), respectively (see also Figure 10). The next curve, IV,<br>
begins at 74 THz, proceeds to 114 THz and ends with 138 THz. The summed heterodyne<br>
calculations are thus:<br>
40 + 74 = 114<br>
64 + 74 + 138.<br>
The frequencies in curve IV are the sum of the frequencies in curve V plus the peak<br>
intensity frequency in curve IV.<br>
Alternatively, the frequencies in curve IV, minus the frequencies in curve V, yield the<br>
peak of curve IV:<br>
114 -40 = 74<br>
138 - 64 = 74.<br>
This is not just a coincidental set of sums or differences in curves IV and V. Every<br>
curve in hydrogen is the result of adding each frequency in any one curve, with the highest<br>
intensity frequency in the next curve.<br>
These hydrogen frequencies are found in both the atom itself, and in the<br>
electromagnetic energy it radiates. The frequencies of the atom and its energy, add and<br>
subtract in regular fashion. This is heterodyning. Thus, not only matter and energy<br>
heterodyne interchangeably, but matter heterodynes its' own energy within itself.<br>
Moreover, the highest intensity frequencies in each curve are heterodynes of<br>
heterodynes. For example, the peak frequency in Curve I of Figure 9 is 2,466 THz, which is<br>
the third harmonic of 616 THz;<br>
4 x 616 THz = 2,466 THz.<br>
Thus, 2,466 THz is the third harmonic of 616 THz (Recall that for heterodyned<br>
harmonics, the result is even multiples of the starting frequency, i.e., for the first harmonic<br>
2X the original frequency and the third harmonic is 4X the original frequency. Multiplying a<br>
frequency by four (4) is a natural result of the heterodyning process.) Thus, 2,466 THz is a<br>
fourth generation heterodyne, namely the third harmonic of 616 THz.<br>
The peak of curve II of Figure 9, a frequency corresponding to 456 THz, is the third<br>
harmonic of 114 THz in curve IV. The peak of curve HI, corresponding to a frequency of<br>
160 THz, is the third harmonic of 40 THz in curve V. The peaks of the curves shown in<br>
Figure 9 are not only heterodynes between the curves but are also harmonics of individual<br>
frequencies which are themselves heterodynes. The whole hydrogen spectrum turns out to be<br>
an incestuously heterodyned set of frequencies and harmonics.<br>
Theoretically, this heterodyne process could go on forever. For example, if 40 is the<br>
peak of a curve, that means the peak is four (4) times a lower number, and it also means that<br>
the peak of the previous curve is 24 (64-40 = 24). It is possible to mathematically extrapolate<br>
backwards and downwards this way to derive lower and lower frequencies. Peaks of<br><br>
successive curves to the left are 24.2382, 15.732, and 10.786 THz, all generated from the<br>
heterodyne process. These frequencies are in complete agreement with the Rydberg formula<br>
for energy levels 6, 7 and S, respectively. Not much attention has historically been given by<br>
the prior art to these lower frequencies and their heterodyning.<br>
This invention teaches that the heterodyned frequency curves amplify the vibrations<br>
and energy of hydrogen. A low intensity frequency on curve IV or V has a very high<br>
intensity by the time it is heterodyned out to curve I. In many respects, the hydrogen atom is<br>
just one big energy amplification system. Moving from low frequencies to high frequencies,<br>
(i.e., from curve V to curve I in Figure 9), the intensities increase dramatically. By<br>
stimulating hydrogen with 2,466 THz at an intensity of 1,000, the result will be 2,466 THz at<br>
1,000 intensity. However, if hydrogen is stimulated with 40 THz at an intensity of 1,000, by<br>
the time it is amplified back out to curve I of Figure 9, the result will be 2,466 THz at an<br>
intensity of 167,000. This heterodyning turns out to have a direct bearing on platinum, and<br>
on how platinum interacts with hydrogen. It all has to do with hydrogen being an energy<br>
amplification system. That is why the lower frequency curves are perceived as being higher<br>
energy levels. By understanding this process, the low frequencies of low intensity suddenly<br>
become potentially very significant.<br>
Platinum resonates with most, if not all, of the hydrogen frequencies with one notable<br>
exception, the highest intensity curve at the far right in the frequency chart of Figure 9 (i.e.,<br>
curve I) representing energy level 1, and beginning with 2,466 THz. Platinum does not<br>
appear to resonate significantly with the ground state transition of the hydrogen atom.<br>
However, it does resonate with multiple upper energy levels of lower frequencies.<br>
With this information, one ongoing mystery can be solved. Ever since lasers were<br>
developed, the prior art chemists believed that there had to be some way to catalyze a<br>
reaction using lasers. Standard approaches involved using the single highest intensity<br>
frequency of an atom (such as 2,466 THz of hydrogen) because it was apparently believed<br>
that the highest intensity frequency would result in the highest reactivity. This approach was<br>
taken due to considering only the energy level diagrams. Accordingly, prior art lasers are<br>
typically tuned to a ground state transition frequency. This use of lasers in the prior art has<br>
been minimally successful for catalyzing chemical reactions. It is now understood why this<br>
approach was not successful. Platinum, the quintessential hydrogen catalyst, does not<br>
resonate with the ground state transition of hydrogen. It resonates with the upper energy<br><br>
level frequencies, in fact, many of the upper level frequencies. Without wishing to be bound<br>
by any particular theory or explanation, this is probably why platinum is such a good<br>
hydrogen catalyst.<br>
Platinum resonates with multiple frequencies from the upper energy levels (i.e., the<br>
lower frequencies). There is a name given to the process of stimulating many upper energy<br>
levels, it is called a laser.<br>
Einstein essentially worked out the statistics on lasers at the turn of the century when<br>
atoms at the ground energy level (E1) are resonated to an excited energy level (E2). Refer to<br>
the number of atoms in the ground state as "N1" and the number of excited atoms as "N2",<br>
with the total "Ntotal. Since there are only two possible states that atoms can occupy.<br><br>
After all the mathematics are performed, the relationship which evolves is:<br><br>
In a two level system; it is predicted that there will never by more than 50% of the<br>
atoms in the higher energy level, E2, at the same time.<br>
If, however, the same group of atoms is energized at three (3) or more energy levels<br>
(i.e., a multi-level system), it is possible to obtain more than 50% of the atoms energized<br>
above the first level. By referring to the ground and energized levels as E1, E2, and E3,<br>
respectively, and the numbers of atoms as Ntotal, N1, N2, and N3, under certain circumstances,<br>
the number of atoms at an elevated energy level (N3) can be more than the number at a lower<br>
energy level (N2). When this happens, it is referred to as a "population inversion".<br>
Population inversion means that more of the atoms are at higher energy levels that at the<br>
lower energy levels.<br>
Population inversion in lasers is important. Population inversion causes amplification<br>
of light energy. For example, in a two-level system, one photon in results in one photon out.<br>
In a system with three (3) or more energy levels and population inversion, one photon in may<br>
result in 5, 10, or 15 photons out (see Figure 11). The amount of photons out depends on the<br>
number of levels and just how energized each level becomes. All lasers are based on this<br>
simple concept of producing a population inversion in a group of atoms, by creating a multi-<br>
level energized system among the atoms. Lasers are simply devices to amplify<br>
electromagnetic wave energy (i.e., light). Laser is actually an abbreviation for Light<br>
Amplification System for Emitting Radiation.<br>
By referring back to the interactions discussed herein between platinum and<br>
hydrogen, platinum energizes 19 upper level frequencies in hydrogen (i.e., 80% of the total<br>
hydrogen frequencies). But only three frequencies are needed for a population inversion.<br>
Hydrogen is stimulated at 19. This is a clearly multi-level system. Moreover, consider that<br>
seventy platinum frequencies do the stimulating. On average, every hydrogen frequency<br>
involved is stimulated by three or four (i.e., 70/19) different platinum frequencies; both<br>
directly resonant frequencies and/or indirectly resonant harmonic frequencies. Platinum<br>
provides ample stimulus, atom per atom, to produce a population inversion in hydrogen.<br>
Finally, consider the fact that every time a stimulated hydrogen atom emits some<br>
electromagnetic energy, that energy is of a frequency that matches and stimulates platinum in<br>
return.<br>
Platinum and hydrogen both resonate with each other in their respective multi-level<br>
systems. Together, platinum and hydrogen form an atomic scale laser (i.e., an energy<br>
amplification system on the atomic level). In so doing, platinum and hydrogen amplify the<br>
energies that are needed to stabilize both the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates, thus<br>
catalyzing the reaction pathway for the formation of water. Platinum is such a good<br>
hydrogen catalyst because it forms a lasing system with hydrogen on the atomic level,<br>
thereby amplifying their respective energies.<br>
Further, this reaction hints that in order to catalyze a reaction system and/or control<br>
the reaction pathway in a reaction system it is possible for only a single transient and/or<br>
intermediate to be formed and/or energized by an applied frequency (e.g., a spectral catalyst)<br>
and that by forming and/or stimulating at least one transient and/or at least one intermediate<br>
that is required to follow for a desired reaction pathway (e.g., either a complex reaction or a<br>
simple reaction), then a frequency, or combination of frequencies, which result in such<br>
formation or stimulation of only one of such required transients and/or intermediates may be<br>
all that is required. Accordingly, the present invention recognizes that in some reaction<br>
systems, by determining at least one required transient and/or intermediate, and by applying<br>
at least one frequency which generates, energizes and/or stabilizes said at least one transient<br>
and/or intermediate, then all other transients and/or intermediates required for a reaction to<br>
proceed down a desired reaction pathway may be self-generated. However, in some cases,<br>
the reaction could be increased in rate by applying the appropriate frequency or spectral<br>
energy pattern, which directly stimulates all transients and/or intermediates that are required<br>
in order for a reaction to proceed down a desired reaction pathway. Accordingly, depending<br>
upon the particulars of any reaction system, it may be desirable for a variety of reasons,<br>
including equipment, environmental reaction conditions, etc., to provide or apply a frequency<br>
or spectral energy pattern which results in the formation and/or stimulation and/or<br>
stabilization of any required transients and/or intermediates. Thus, in order to determine an<br>
appropriate frequency or spectral energy pattern, it is first desirable to determine which<br>
transients and/or intermediates are present in any reaction pathway. Similarly, a conditioned<br>
participant could be formulated to accomplish a similar task.<br>
Specifically, once all known required transients and/or intermediates are determined,<br>
then, one can determine experimentally or empirically which transients and/or intermediates<br>
are essential to a reaction pathway and then determine, which transients and or intermediates<br>
can be self-generated by the stimulation and/or formation of a different transient or<br>
intermediate. Once such determinations are made, appropriate spectral energies (e.g.,<br>
electromagnetic frequencies) can then be applied to the reaction system to obtain the<br>
desirable reaction product and/or desirable reaction pathway.<br>
It is known that an atom of platinum interacts with an atom of hydrogen and/or a<br>
hydroxy intermediate. And, that is exactly what modern chemistry has taught for the last one<br>
hundred years, based on Ostwald's theory of catalysis. However, the prior art teaches that<br>
catalysts must participate in the reaction by binding to the reactants, in other words, the prior<br>
art teaches a matter:matter bonding interaction is required for physical catalysts. As<br>
previously stated, these reactions follow these steps:<br>
1. Reactant diffusion to the catalyst site;<br>
2. Bonding of reactant to the catalyst site;<br>
3. Reaction of the catalyst-reactant complex;<br>
4. Bond rupture at the catalytic site (product); and<br>
5. Diffusion of the product away from the catalyst site.<br>
However, according to the present invention, for example, energy:energy frequencies<br>
can interact as well as energy: matter frequencies. Moreover, matter radiates energy, with the<br>
energy frequencies being substantially the same as the matter frequencies. So platinum<br>
vibrates at the frequency of 1,060 THz, and it also radiates electromagnetic energy at 1,060<br>
THz. Thus, according to the present invention, the distinction between energy frequencies<br>
and matter frequencies starts to look less important.<br>
Resonance can be produced in, for example, the reaction intermediates by permitting<br>
them to come into contact with additional matter vibrating at substantially the same<br>
frequencies, such as those frequencies of a platinum atom (e.g., platinum stimulating the<br>
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to form water). Alternatively, according to the<br>
present invention, resonance can be produced in the intermediates by introducing<br>
electromagnetic energy corresponding to one or more platinum energies, which also vibrate<br>
at the same frequencies, thus at least partially mimicking (an additional mechanism of<br>
platinum is resonance with the H2 molecule, a pathway reactant) the mechanism of action of a<br>
platinum catalyst. Matter, or energy, it makes no difference as far as the frequencies are<br>
concerned, because when the frequencies match, energy transfers. Thus, physical catalysts<br>
are not required. Rather, the application of at least a portion of the spectral pattern of a<br>
physical catalyst may be sufficient (i.e. at least a portion of the catalytic spectral pattern).<br>
However, in another preferred embodiment, substantially all of a spectral pattern can be<br>
applied.<br>
Still further, by understanding the catalyst mechanism of action, particular frequencies<br>
can be applied to, for example, one or more reactants in a reaction system and, for example,<br>
cause the applied frequencies to heterodyne with existing frequencies in the matter itself to<br>
result in frequencies which correspond to one or more platinum catalyst or other relevant<br>
spectral frequencies. For example, both the hydrogen atom and the hydrogen molecule have<br>
unique frequencies. By heterodyning the frequencies a subtractive frequency can be<br>
determined: <br>
The Difference hatom-molecule frequency applied to the H2 molecule reactant will<br>
heterodyne with the molecule and energize the individual hydrogen atoms as intermediates.<br>
Similarly, any reaction participant can serve as the heterodyning backboard for stimulation of<br>
another participant. For example,<br><br>
This approach enables greater flexibility for choice of appropriate equipment to apply<br>
appropriate frequencies. However, the key to this approach is understanding catalyst<br>
mechanisms of action and the reaction pathway so that appropriate choices for application of<br>
frequencies can be made.<br>
Specifically, whenever reference is made to, for example, a spectral catalyst<br>
duplicating at least a portion of a physical catalyst's spectral pattern, this reference is to all<br>
the different frequencies produced by a physical catalyst; including, but not necessarily<br>
limited to, electronic, vibrational, rotational, and NOF frequencies. To catalyze, control,<br>
and/or direct a chemical reaction then, all that is needed is to duplicate one or more<br>
frequencies from a physical catalyst, with, for example, an appropriate electromagnetic<br>
energy. The actual physical presence of the catalyst is not necessary. A spectral catalyst can<br>
substantially completely replace a physical catalyst, if desired.<br>
A spectra] catalyst can also augment or promote the activity of a physical catalyst.<br>
The exchange of energy at particular frequencies, between hydrogen, hydroxy, and platinum<br>
is primarily what drives the conversion to water. These participants interact and create a<br>
miniature atomic scale lasing system that amplify their respective energies. The addition of<br>
these same energies to a holoreaction system, using a spectral catalyst, does the same thing.<br>
The spectral catalyst amplifies the participant energies by resonating with them and when<br>
frequencies match, energy transfers and the chemicals (matter) can absorb the energy. Thus, a<br>
spectral catalyst can augment a physical catalyst, as well as replace it. In so doing, the<br>
spectral catalyst may increase the reaction rate, enhance specificity, and/or allow for the use<br>
of less physical catalyst.<br>
Figure 12 shows a basic bell-shaped curve produced by comparing how much energy<br>
an object absorbs, as compared to the frequency of the energy. This curve is called a<br>
resonance curve. As elsewhere herein stated, the energy transfer between, for example,<br>
atoms or molecules, reaches a maximum at the resonant frequency (fo). The farther away an<br>
applied frequency is from the resonant frequency, fo, the lower the energy transfer (e.g.,<br>
matter to matter, energy to matter, etc.). At some point the energy transfer will fall to a value<br>
representing only about 50% of that at the resonant frequency fo. The frequency higher than<br>
the resonant frequency, at which energy transfer is only about 50% is called "f2." The<br>
frequency lower than the resonant frequency, at which about 50% energy transfer occurs, is<br>
labeled "f1."<br>
The resonant characteristics of different objects can be compared using the<br>
information from the simple exemplary resonance curve shown in Figure 12. One such<br>
useful characteristic is called the "resonance quality" or "Q" factor. To determine the<br>
resonance quality for an object the following equation is utilized:<br><br>
Accordingly, as shown from the equation, if the bell-shaped resonance curve is tall and<br>
narrow, then (f2 - f1) will be a very small number and Q, the resonance quality, will be high<br>
(see Figure 13a). An example of a material with a high "Q" is a high quality quartz crystal<br>
resonator. If the resonance curve is low and broad, then the spread or difference between f2<br>
and f1 will be relatively large. An example of a material with a low "Q" is a marshmallow.<br>
The dividing of the resonant frequency by this large number will produce a much lower Q<br>
value (see Figure 13b).<br>
Atoms and molecules, for example, have resonance curves which exhibit properties<br>
similar to larger objects such as quartz crystals and marshmallows. If the goal is to stimulate<br>
atoms in a reaction (e.g., hydrogen in the reaction to produce water as mentioned previously)<br>
a precise resonant frequency produced by a holoreaction system component or environmental<br>
reaction condition (e.g., hydrogen) can be used. It is not necessary to use the precise<br>
frequency, however. Use of a frequency that is near a resonant frequency of, for example,<br>
one or more holoreaction system components or environmental reaction conditions is<br>
adequate. There will not be quite as much of an effect as using the exact resonant frequency,<br>
because less energy will be transferred, but there will still be an effect. The closer the applied<br>
frequency is to the resonant frequency, the more the effect. The farther away the applied<br>
frequency is from the resonant frequency, the less effect that is present (i.e., the less energy<br>
transfer that occurs).<br>
Harmonics present a similar situation. As previously stated, harmonics are created by<br>
the heterodyning (i.e., adding and subtracting) of frequencies, allowing the transfer of<br>
significant amounts of energy. Accordingly, for example., desirable results can be achieved in<br>
chemical reactions if applied frequencies (e.g., at least a portion of a spectral catalyst) are<br>
harmonics (i.e., matching heterodynes) with one or more resonant frequency(ies) of one or<br>
more holoreaction system components or environmental reaction conditions.<br>
Further, similar to applied frequencies being close to resonant frequencies, applied<br>
frequencies which are close to the harmonic frequency can also produce desirable results.<br>
The amplitude of the energy transfer will be less relative to a harmonic frequency, but an<br>
effect will still occur. For example, if the harmonic produces 70% of the amplitude of the<br>
fundamental resonant frequency and by using a frequency which is merely close to the<br>
harmonic, for example, about 90% on the harmonic's resonance curve, then the total effect<br>
will be 90% of 70%, or about 63% total energy transfer in comparison to a direct resonant<br>
frequency. Accordingly, according to the present invention, when at least a portion of the<br>
frequencies of one or more holoreaction system components or environmental reaction<br>
conditions at least partially match, then at least some energy will transfer and at least some<br>
reaction will occur (i.e., when frequencies match, energy transfers).<br>
DUPLICATING THE CATALYST MECHANISMS OF ACTION<br>
As stated previously, to catalyze, control, and/or direct a chemical reaction, a spectral<br>
catalyst can be applied. The spectral catalyst may correspond to at least a portion of a<br>
spectral pattern of a physical catalyst or the spectral catalyst may correspond to frequencies<br>
which form or stimulate required participants (e.g., heterodyned frequencies) or the spectral<br>
catalyst may substantially duplicate environmental reaction conditions such as temperature or<br>
pressure. Thus, as now taught by the present invention, the actual physical presence of a<br>
catalyst is not required to achieve the desirable chemical reactions. The removal of a<br>
physical catalyst is accomplished by understanding the underlying mechanism inherent in<br>
catalysis, namely that desirable energy can be exchanged (i.e., transferred) between, for<br>
example, (1) at least one participant (e.g., reactant, transient, intermediate, activated complex,<br>
reaction product, promoter and/or poison) and/or at least one component in a reaction system<br>
and (2) an applied electromagnetic energy (e.g., spectral catalyst) when such energy is<br>
present at one or more specific frequencies. In other words, the targeted mechanism that<br>
nature has built into the catalytic process can be copied according to the teachings of the<br>
present invention. Nature can be further mimicked because the catalyst process reveals<br>
several opportunities for duplicating catalyst mechanisms of action, and hence improving the<br>
use of spectral catalysts, as well as the control of countless chemical reactions.<br>
For example, the previously discussed reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to produce<br>
water, which used platinum as a catalyst, is a good starting point for understanding catalyst<br>
mechanisms of action. For example, this invention discloses that platinum catalyzes the<br>
reaction in several ways not contemplated by the prior an:<br>
Platinum directly resonates with and energizes reaction intermediates and/or<br>
transients (e.g., atomic hydrogen and hydroxy radicals);<br>
Platinum harmonically resonates with and energizes at least one reaction<br>
intermediate and or transient (e.g., atomic hydrogen); and<br>
Platinum energizes multiple upper energy levels of at least one reaction intermediate<br>
and or transient (e.g., atomic hydrogen).<br>
This knowledge can be utilized to improve the functioning of the spectral catalyst<br>
and/or spectral energy catalyst to design spectral catalysts and spectral energy catalysts which<br>
differ from actual catalytic spectral patterns, and to design physical catalysts, (or<br>
conditionable participants that can be conditioned to function as physical catalysts) and to<br>
optimize environmental reaction conditions. For example, the frequencies of atomic<br>
platinum are in the ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared regions of the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum. The electronic spectra of virtually all atoms are in these same regions. However,<br>
these very high electromagnetic frequencies can be a problem for large-scale and industrial<br>
applications because wave energies having high frequencies typically do not penetrate matter<br>
very well (i.e., do not penetrate far into matter). The tendency of wave energy to be absorbed<br>
rather than transmitted, can be referred to as attenuation. High frequency wave energies<br>
have a high attenuation, and thus do not penetrate far into a typical industrial scale reaction<br>
vessel containing typical reactants for a chemical reaction. Thus, the duplication and<br>
application of at least a portion of the spectral pattern of platinum into a commercial scale<br>
reaction vessel will typically be a slow process because a large portion of the applied spectral<br>
pattern of the spectral catalysts may be rapidly absorbed near the edges of the reaction vessel.<br>
Thus, in order to input energy into a large industrial-sized commercial reaction vessel,<br>
a lower frequency energy could be used that would penetrate farther into the reactants housed<br>
within the reaction vessel. The present invention teaches that this can be accomplished in a<br>
unique manner by copying nature. As discussed herein, the spectra of atoms and molecules<br>
are broadly classified into three (3) different groups: electronic, vibrational, and rotational.<br>
The electronic spectra of atoms and small molecules are said to result from transitions of<br>
electrons from one energy level to another, and have the corresponding highest frequencies,<br>
typically occuring in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) regions of the EM<br>
spectrum. The vibrational spectra are said to result primarily from this movement of bonds<br>
between individual atoms within molecules, and typically occur in the infrared and<br>
microwave regions. Rotational spectra occur primarily in the microwave and radiowave<br>
regions of the EM spectrum due, primarily, to the rotation of the molecules.<br>
Microwave or radiowave radiation could be an acceptable frequency to be used as a<br>
spectral catalyst because it would penetrate well into a large reaction vessel. Unfortunately,<br>
platinum atoms do not produce frequencies in the microwave or radiowave portions of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum because they do not have vibrational or rotational spectra.<br>
However, by copying the mechanism of action platinum, selected platinum frequencies can<br>
be used as a model for a spectral catalyst in the microwave portion of the spectrum.<br>
Specifically, as previously discussed, one mechanism of action of platinum in the<br>
holoreaction system to produce water involves energizing at least one reaction intermediate<br>
and/or transient. Reaction intermediates in this reaction are atomic hydrogen and the hydroxy<br>
radical. Atomic hydrogen has a high frequency electronic spectrum without vibrational or<br>
rotational spectra. The hydroxy radical, on the other hand, is a molecule, and has vibrational<br>
and rotational spectra as well as an electronic spectrum. Thus, the hydroxy radical emits,<br>
absorbs and heterodynes frequencies in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum.<br>
Thus, to copy the mechanism of action of platinum in the reaction to form water,<br>
namely resonating with at least one reaction intermediate and/or transient, the hydroxy<br>
intermediate can be specifically targeted via resonance. However, instead of resonating with<br>
the hydroxy radical in its electronic spectrum, as physical platinum catalyst does, at least one<br>
hydroxy frequency in the microwave portion of the EM spectrum can be used to resonate<br>
with the hydroxy radical. Hydroxy radicals heterodyne at a microwave frequency of about<br>
21.4 GHz. Energizing a reaction system of hydrogen and oxygen gas with a spectral<br>
catalyst at about 21.4 GHz will catalyze the formation of water. In this instance, the<br>
mechanism of action of the physical catalyst platinum has been partially copied and the<br>
mechanism has been shifted to a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
The second method discussed above for platinum catalyzing a reaction, involves<br>
harmonically energizing at least one reaction intermediate in the reaction system. For<br>
example, assume that one or more lasers was available to catalyze the hydrogen-oxygen<br>
reaction to form water, however, the frequency range of such lasers was only from, for<br>
example, 1,500 to 2,000 THz. Platinum does not produce frequencies in that portion of the<br>
EM spectrum. Moreover, the two hydroxy frequencies that platinum resonates with, 975 and<br>
1,060 THz, are outside the frequency range that the lasers, in this example, can generate.<br>
Likewise, the hydrogen spectrum does not have any frequencies between 1,500 and 2,000<br>
THz (see Figures 9-10).<br>
However, according to the present invention, by again copying the mechanism of<br>
action of platinum, frequencies can be adapted or selected to be convenient and/or efficient<br>
for the equipment available. Specifically, harmonic frequencies corresponding to the reaction<br>
intermediates and/or transients, and also corresponding to frequencies capable of being<br>
generated by the lasers of this example, can be utilized. For the hydroxy radical, having a<br>
resonant frequency of 975 THz, the first harmonic is 1,950 THz. Thus, a laser of this<br>
example could be tuned to 1,950 THz to resonate harmonically with the hydroxy<br>
intermediate. The first harmonics of three different hydrogen frequencies also fall within the<br>
operational range of the lasers of this example. The fundamental frequencies are 755, 770<br>
and 781 THz and the first harmonics are 1,510, 1,540, and 1,562 THz, respectively. Thus, a<br>
laser of this example could be tuned to the first harmonics 1,510, 1,540, and 1,562 THz in<br>
order to achieve a heterodyned matching of frequencies between electromagnetic energy and<br>
matter and thus achieve a transfer and absorption of said energy.<br>
Thus, depending on how many lasers are available and the frequencies to which the<br>
lasers can be tuned, third or fourth harmonics could also be utilized. The third harmonic of<br>
the hydrogen frequency, 456 THz, occurs at 1,824 THz, which is also within the operating<br>
range of the lasers of this example. Similarly, the fourth harmonic of the hydrogen<br>
frequency, 314 THz, occurs at 1,570 THz, which again falls within the operating range of the<br>
lasers of this example. In summary, a mechanism of action of a physical catalyst can be<br>
copied, duplicated or mimicked while moving the relevant spectral catalyst frequencies, to a<br>
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that matches equipment available for the reaction<br>
system and the application of electromagnetic energy.<br>
The third method discussed above for platinum catalyzing this reaction involves<br>
energizing at least one reaction intermediate and/or transient at multiple upper energy levels<br>
and setting up, for example, an atomic scale laser system. Again, assume that the same lasers<br>
discussed above are the only electromagnetic energy sources available and assume that there<br>
are a total of ten (10) lasers available. There are four (4) first harmonics available for<br>
targeting within the operating frequency range of 1,500 to 2,000 THz. Some portion of the<br>
lasers should be adjusted to four (4) first harmonics and some should be adjusted to the third,<br>
fourth, and higher harmonics. Specifically, the present invention has discovered that a<br>
mechanism of action that physical platinum uses is to resonate with multiple upper energy<br>
levels of at least one reaction participant. It is now understood that the more upper energy<br>
levels that are involved, the better. This creates an atomic scale laser system with<br>
amplification of the electromagnetic energies being exchanged between the atoms of<br>
platinum and hydrogen. This amplification of energy catalyzes the reaction at a much faster<br>
rate than the reaction would ordinarily proceed. This mechanism of action can also be<br>
exploited to catalyze, for example, the reaction with the available lasers discussed above.<br>
For example, rather than setting all ten (10) lasers to the four (4) first harmonics and<br>
energizing only four (4) levels, it should now be understood that it would be desirable to<br>
energize as many different energy levels as possible. This task can be accomplished by<br>
setting each of the ten (10) lasers to a different frequency. Even though the physical catalyst<br>
platinum is not present, the energizing of multiple upper energy levels in the hydrogen will<br>
amplify the energies being exchanged between the atoms, and the reaction system will form<br>
its' own laser system between the hydrogen atoms. This will permit the reaction to proceed<br>
at a much faster rate than it ordinarily would. Once again, nature can be mimicked by<br>
duplicating one of her mechanisms of action by specifically targeting multiple energy levels<br>
with a spectral catalyst to achieve energy transfer in a novel manner.<br>
The preceding discussion on duplicating catalyst mechanisms of action is just the<br>
beginning of an understanding of many variables associated with the use of spectral catalysts.<br>
These additional variables should be viewed as potentially very useful tools for enhancing the<br>
performance of spectral energy, and/or physical catalysts. There are many factors and<br>
variables that affect both catalyst performance, and chemical reactions in general. For<br>
example, when the same catalyst (or conditioned participant) is mixed with the same reactant,<br>
but exposed to different environmental reaction conditions such as temperature or pressure,<br>
different products can be produced. Consider the following example:<br>
The same catalyst with the same reactant, produces quite different products in these<br>
two reactions, namely molecular hydrogen or cyclohexane, depending on the reaction<br>
temperature.<br>
Many factors are known in the art which affect the direction and intensity with which<br>
a physical catalyst guides a reaction or with which a reaction proceeds in general.<br>
Temperature is but one of these factors. Other factors include pressure, volume, surface area<br>
of physical catalysts, solvents, support materials, contaminants, catalyst size and shape and<br>
composition, reactor vessel size, shape and composition, electric fields, magnetic fields, and<br>
acoustic fields, whether a conditioning energy was introduced to a conditionable participant<br>
prior to the conditioned participant being involved or activated in a reaction system, etc.. The<br>
present invention teaches that these factors all have one thing in common. These factors are<br>
capable of changing the spectral patterns (i.e., frequency pattern) of, for example, participants<br>
and/or reaction system components. Some changes in spectra are very well studied and thus<br>
much information is available for consideration and application thereof. The prior art does<br>
not contemplate, however, the spectral chemistry basis for each of these factors, and how<br>
they relate to catalyst mechanisms of action, and chemical reactions in general. Further,<br>
alternatively, effects of the aforementioned factors can be enhanced or diminished by the<br>
application of additional spectral, spectral energy, and/or physical catalyst frequencies.<br>
Moreover, these environmental reaction conditions can be at least partially simulated in a<br>
holoreaction system by the application of one or more corresponding spectral environmental<br>
reaction conditions (e.g., a spectral energy pattern which duplicates at least a portion of one<br>
or more environmental reaction conditions). Alternatively, one spectral environmental<br>
reaction condition (e.g., a spectral energy pattern corresponding to temperature) could be<br>
substituted for another (e.g., spectral energy pattern corresponding to pressure) so long as the<br>
goal of matching of frequencies was met.<br>
TEMPERATURE<br>
At very low temperatures, the spectral pattern of an atom or molecule has clean, crisp<br>
peaks (see Figure 15a). As the temperature increases, the peaks begin to broaden, producing<br>
a bell-shaped curve of a spectral pattern (see Figure 15b). At even higher temperatures, the<br>
bell-shaped curve broadens even more, to include more and more frequencies on either side<br>
of the primary frequency (see Figure 15c). This phenomenon is called "broadening".<br>
These spectral curves are very much like the resonance curves discussed in the<br>
previous section. Spectroscopists use resonance curve terminology to describe spectral<br>
frequency curves for atoms and molecules (see Figure 16). The frequency at the top of the<br>
curve, fo, is called the resonance frequency. There is a frequency (f2) above the resonance<br>
frequency and another (f1) below it (i.e., in frequency), at which the energy or intensity (i.e.,<br>
amplitude) is 50% of that for the resonance frequency fo. The quantity f2 - f1 is a measure of<br>
how wide or narrow the spectral frequency curve is. This quantity (f2 - f1) is the "line<br>
width". A spectrum with narrow curves has a small line width, while a spectrum with wide<br>
curves has a large line width.<br>
Temperature affects the line width of spectral curves. Line width can affect catalyst<br>
performance, chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways. At low temperatures, the spectral<br>
curves of chemical species will be separate and distinct, with a lesser possibility for the<br>
transfer of resonant energy between potential holoreaction system components (see Figure<br>
17a). However, as the line widths of potentially reactive chemical species broaden, their<br>
spectral curves may start to overlap with spectral curves of other chemical species (see Figure<br>
17b). When frequencies match, or spectral energy patterns overlap, energy transfers. Thus,<br>
when temperatures are low, frequencies do not match and reactions are slow. At higher<br>
temperatures, resonant transfer of energy can take place and reactions can proceed very<br>
quickly or proceed along a different reaction pathway than they otherwise would have at a<br>
lower temperature.<br>
Besides affecting the line width of the spectral curves, temperature also can change,<br>
for example, the resonant frequency of holoreaction system components. For some chemical<br>
species, the resonant frequency will shift as temperature changes. This can be seen in the<br>
infrared absorption spectra in Figure 18a and blackbody radiation graphs shown in Figure<br>
18b. Further, atoms and molecules do not all shift their resonant frequencies by the same<br>
amount or in the same direction, when they are at the same temperature. This can also affect<br>
catalyst performance. For example, if a catalyst resonant frequency shifts more with<br>
increased temperature than the resonant frequency of its targeted chemical species, then the<br>
catalyst could end up matching the frequency of a chemical species, and resonance may be<br>
created where none previously existed (see Figure 18c). Specifically, Figure 18c shows<br>
catalyst "C" at low temperature and "C*" at high temperature. The catalyst "C*" resonates<br>
with reactant "A" at high temperatures, but not at low temperatures.<br>
The amplitude or intensity of a spectral line may be affected by temperature also. For<br>
example, linear and symmetric rotor molecules will have an increase in intensity as the<br>
temperature is lowered while other molecules will increase intensity as the temperature is<br>
raised. These changes of spectral intensity can also affect catalyst performance. Consider the<br>
example where a low intensity spectral curve of a catalyst is resonant with one or more<br>
frequencies of a specific chemical target. Only small amounts of energy can be transferred<br>
from the catalyst to the target chemical (e.g., a hydroxy intermediate). As temperature<br>
increases, the amplitude of the catalyst's curve increases also. In this example, the catalyst<br>
can transfer much larger amounts of energy to the chemical target when the temperature is<br>
raised.<br>
If the chemical target is the intermediate chemical species for an alternative reaction<br>
route, the type and ratio of end products may be affected. By examining the above<br>
cyclohexene/palladium reaction again, at temperatures below 300°C, the products are<br>
benzene and hydrogen gas. However, when the temperature is above 300°C, the products are<br>
benzene and cyclohexane. Temperature is affecting the palladium and/or other constituents<br>
in the holoreaction system (including, for example, reactants, intermediates, and/or products)<br>
in such a way that an alternative reaction pathway leading to the formation of cyclohexane is<br>
favored above 300°C. This could be a result of, for example, increased line width, altered<br>
resonance frequencies, or changes in spectral curve intensities for any of the components in<br>
the holoreaction system.<br>
It is important to consider not only the spectral catalyst frequencies one may wish to<br>
use to catalyze a reaction, but also the reaction conditions under which those frequencies are<br>
supposed to work. For example, in the palladium/cyclohexene reaction at low temperatures,<br>
the palladium may match frequencies with an intermediate for the formation of hydrogen<br>
molecules (H2). At temperatures above 300ºC the reactants and transients may be unaffected,<br>
but the palladium may have an increased line width, altered resonant frequency and/or<br>
increased intensity. The changes in the line width, resonant frequency and/or intensity may<br>
cause the palladium to match frequencies and transfer energy to an intermediate in the<br>
formation of cyclohexane instead. If a spectral catalyst was to be used to assist in the<br>
formation of cyclohexane at room temperature, the frequency for the cyclohexane<br>
intermediate would be more effective if used, rather than the spectral catalyst frequency used<br>
at room temperature.<br>
Thus, it may be important to understand the holoreaction system dynamics in<br>
designing and selecting an appropriate spectral catalyst. The transfer of energy between<br>
different reaction system components will vary, depending on temperature. Once understood,<br>
this allows one to knowingly adjust temperature to optimize a reaction, reaction product,<br>
interaction and/or formation of reaction product at a desirable reaction rate, without the trial<br>
and error approaches of prior art. Further, it allows one to choose catalysts such as physical<br>
catalysts, spectral catalysts, and/or spectral energy patterns to optimize a desired reaction<br>
pathway. This understanding of the spectral impact of temperature allows one to perform<br>
customarily high temperature (and, sometimes high danger) chemical processes at safer,<br>
room temperatures. It also allows one to design physical catalysts which work at much<br>
broader temperature ranges (e.g., frigid arctic temperatures or hot furnace temperatures), as<br>
desired.<br>
PRESSURE<br>
Pressure and temperature are directly related to each other. Specifically, from the<br>
ideal gas law, we know that<br>
PV = nRT<br>
where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and<br>
T is the absolute temperature. Thus, at equilibrium, an increase in temperature will result in a<br>
corresponding increase in pressure. Pressure also has an effect on spectral patterns.<br>
Specifically, increases in pressure can cause broadening and changes in spectral curves, just<br>
as increases in temperature do (see Figure 19 which shows the pressure broadening effects on<br>
the NH3 3.3 absorption line).<br>
Mathematical treatments of pressure broadening are generally grouped into either<br>
collision or statistical theories. In collision theories, the assumption is made that most of the<br>
time an atom or molecule is so far from other atoms or molecules that their energy fields do<br>
not interact. Occasionally, however, the atoms or molecules come so close together that they<br>
collide. In this case, the atom or molecule may undergo a change in wave phase (spectral)<br>
function, or may change to a different energy level. Collision theories treat the matter's<br>
emitted energy as occurring only when the atom or molecule is far from others, and is not<br>
involved in a collision. Because collision theories ignore spectral frequencies during<br>
collisions, collision theories fail to predict accurately chemical behavior at more than a few<br>
atmospheres of pressure, when collisions are frequent.<br>
Statistical theories, however, consider spectral frequencies before, during and after<br>
collisions. They are based on calculating the probabilities that various atoms and/or<br>
molecules are interacting with, or perturbed by other atoms or molecules. The drawback with<br>
statistical treatments of pressure effects is that the statistical treatments do not do a good job<br>
of accounting for the effects of molecular motion. In any event, neither collision nor<br>
statistical theories adequately predict the rich interplay of frequencies and heterodynes that<br>
take place as pressure is increased. Experimental work has demonstrated that increased<br>
pressure can have effects similar to those produced by increased temperature, by:<br>
1) broadening of the spectral curve, producing increased line width; and<br>
2) shifting of the resonant frequency (fo).<br>
Pressure effects different from those produced by temperatures are: (1) pressure<br>
changes typically do not affect intensity, (see Figure 20 which shows a theoretical set of<br>
curves exhibiting an unchanged intensity for three applied different pressures) as with<br>
temperature changes; and (2) the curves produced by pressure broadening are often less<br>
symmetric than the temperature-affected curves. Consider the shape of the three theoretical<br>
curves shown in Figure 20. As the pressure increases, the curves become less symmetrical,<br>
A tail extending into the higher frequencies develops. This upper frequency extension is<br>
confirmed by the experimental work shown in Figure 21. Specifically, Figure 21a shows a<br>
pattern for the absorption by water vapor in air (10g of H2O per cubic meter); and Figure 21b<br>
shows the absorption in NH3 at 1 atmosphere pressure<br>
Pressure broadening effects on spectral curves are broadly grouped into two types:<br>
resonance or "Holtsmark" broadening, and "Lorentz" broadening. Holtsmark broadening is<br>
secondary to collisions between atoms of the same element, and thus the collisions are<br>
considered to be symmetrical. Lorentz broadening results from collisions between atoms or<br>
molecules which are different. The collisions are asymmetric, and the resonant frequency, fo,<br>
is often shifted to a lower frequency. This shift in resonant frequency is shown in Figure 20.<br>
The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany changes in pressure can<br>
affect catalysts, both physical and spectral, and chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways.<br>
At low pressures, the spectral curves tend to be fairly narrow and crisp, and nearly<br>
symmetrical about the resonant frequency. However, as pressures increase, the curves may<br>
broaden, shift, and develop high frequency tails.<br>
At low pressures the spectral frequencies in the holoreaction system might be so<br>
different for the various atoms and molecules that there may be little or no resonant effect,<br>
and thus little or no energy transfer. At higher pressures, however, the combination of<br>
broadening, shifting and extension into higher frequencies can produce overlapping between<br>
the spectral curves, resulting in the creation of resonance, where none previously existed, and<br>
thus, the transfer of energy. The holoreaction system may proceed down one reaction<br>
pathway or another, depending on the changes in spectral curves produced by various<br>
pressure changes. One reaction pathway may be resonant and proceed at moderate pressure,<br>
while another reaction pathway may be resonant and predominate at higher pressures. As<br>
with temperature, it is important to consider the holoreaction system frequencies and<br>
mechanisms of action of various catalysts under the environmental reaction conditions one<br>
wishes to duplicate. Specifically, in order for an efficient transfer of energy to occur<br>
between, for example, a spectral catalyst and at least one reactant in a holoreaction system,<br>
there must be at least some overlap in frequencies.<br>
For example, a reaction with a physical catalyst at 400 THz and a key transient at 500<br>
THz may proceed slowly at atmospheric pressure. Where the frequency pressure is raised to<br>
about five (5) atmospheres, the catalyst broadens out through the 500 THz, for example, of<br>
the transient. This allows the transfer of energy between the catalyst and transient by, for<br>
example, energizing and stimulating the transient. The reaction then proceeds very quickly.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory or explanation, it appears that, the<br>
speed of the reaction has much less to do with the number of collisions (as taught by the prior<br>
art) than it has to do with the spectral patterns of the holoreaction system components. In the<br>
above example, the reaction could be energized at low pressures by applying the 500 THz<br>
frequency to directly stimulate the key transient. This could also be accompanied indirectly<br>
using various heterodynes, (e.g., @ 1,000 THz harmonic, or a 100 THz non-harmonic<br>
heterodyne between the catalyst and transient (500 THz - 400 THz = 100 THz.).<br>
As shown herein, the transfer of energy between different holoreaction system<br>
components will vary, depending on pressure. Once understood, this allows one to<br>
knowingly adjust pressure to optimize a reaction, without the trial and error approaches of<br>
prior art. Further, it allows one to choose catalysts such as physical catalysts, spectral<br>
catalysts, and/or spectral energy patterns to optimize one or more desired reaction pathways.<br>
This understanding of the spectral impact of pressure allows one to perform customarily high<br>
pressure (and thus, typically, high danger) chemical processes at safer, room pressures. It<br>
also allows one to design physical catalysts which work over a large range of acceptable<br>
pressures (e.g., low pressures approaching a vacuum to several atmospheres of pressure).<br>
SURFACE AREA<br>
Traditionally, the surface are of a catalyst has been considered to be important<br>
because the available surface area controls the number of available binding sites.<br>
Supposedly, the more exposed binding sites, the more catalysis. In light of the spectral<br>
mechanisms disclosed in the present invention, surface area may be important for another<br>
reason.<br>
Many of the spectral catalyst frequencies that correspond to physical catalysts are<br>
electronic frequencies in the visible light and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. These high<br>
frequencies have relatively poor penetrance into, for example, large reaction vessels that<br>
contain one or more reactants. The high frequency spectral emissions from a catalyst such as<br>
platinum or palladium (or the equivalent spectral catalyst) will thus not travel very far into<br>
such a holoreaction system before such spectral emissions (or spectral catalysts) are<br>
absorbed. Thus, for example, an atom or molecule must be fairly close to a physical catalyst<br>
so that their respective electronic frequencies can interact.<br>
Thus, surface area primarily affects the probability that a particular chemical species,<br>
will be close enough to the physical catalyst to interact with its electromagnetic spectra<br>
emission(s). With small surface area, few atoms or molecules will be close enough to<br>
interact. However, as surface area increases, so too does the probability that more atoms or<br>
molecules will be within range for reaction. Thus, rather than increasing the available<br>
number of binding sites, larger surface area probably increases the volume of the reaction<br>
system exposed to the spectral catalyst frequencies or patterns. This is similar to the concept<br>
of assuring adequate penetration of a spectral catalyst into a holoreaction system (e.g.,<br>
assuming that there are adequate opportunities for species to interact with each other).<br>
An understanding of the effects of surface area on catalysts and reaction system<br>
components allows one to knowingly adjust surface area and other reaction system<br>
components to optimize a reaction, reaction pathway and/or formation of reaction product(s),<br>
at a desirable reaction rate, without the drawbacks of the prior art. For instance, surface area<br>
is currently optimized by making catalyst particles as small as possible, thereby maximizing<br>
the overall surface area. The small particles have a tendency to, for example, sinter (merge or<br>
bond together) which decreases the overall surface area and catalytic activity. Rejuvenation<br>
of a large surface area catalyst can be a costly and time-consuming process. This process can<br>
be avoided with an understanding of the herein presented invention in the field of spectral<br>
chemistry. For example, assume a reaction is quickly catalyzed by a 3 m2 catalyst bed (in a<br>
transfer of energy from catalyst to a key reactant and product). After sintering takes place,<br>
however, the surface area is reduced to 1 m". Thus, the transfer of energy from the catalyst is<br>
dramatically reduced, and the reaction slows down. The costly and time-consuming process<br>
of rejuvenating the surface area can be avoided (or at least delayed) by augmenting the<br>
reaction system with one or more desirable spectral energy patterns. In addition, because<br>
spectral energy patterns can affect the final physical form or phase of a material, as well as its<br>
chemical formula, the sintering process itself may be reduced or eliminated.<br>
CATALYST SIZE AND SHAPE<br>
In a related line of reasoning, catalyst size and shape are classically thought to affect<br>
physical catalyst activity. Selectivity of reactions controlled by particle size has historically<br>
been used to steer catalytic pathways. As with surface area, certain particle sizes are thought<br>
to provide a maximum number of active binding sites and thus maximize the reaction rate.<br>
The relationship between size and surface area has been previously discussed.<br>
In light of the current understanding of the spectral mechanisms underlying the<br>
activity of physical catalysts and reactions in general, catalyst size and shape may be<br>
important for other reasons. One of those reasons is a phenomenon called "self absorption".<br>
When a single atom or molecule produces its' classical spectral pattern it radiates<br>
electromagnetic energy which travels outward from the atom or molecule into neighboring<br>
space. Figure 22a shows radiation from a single atom versus radiation from a group of atoms<br>
as shown in Figure 22b. As more and more atoms or molecules group together, radiation<br>
from the center of the group is absorbed by its' neighbors and may never make it out into<br>
space. Depending on the size and shape of the group of atoms, self absorption can cause a<br>
number of changes in the spectral emission pattern (see Figure 23). Specifically, Figure. 23a<br>
shows a normal spectral curve produced by a single atom; Figure 23b shows a resonant<br>
frequency shift due to self absorption; Figure 23c shows a self-reversal spectral pattern<br>
produced by self absorption in a group of atoms and Figure 23d shows a self-reversal spectral<br>
pattern produced by self absorption in a group of atoms. These changes include a shift in<br>
resonant frequency and self-reversal patterns.<br>
The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany changes in catalyst<br>
size and shape can affect catalysts, chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways. For<br>
example, atoms or molecules of a physical catalyst may produce spectral frequencies in the<br>
reaction system which resonate with a key transient and/or reaction product. With larger<br>
groups of atoms, such as in a sintered catalyst, the combination of resonant frequency shifting<br>
and self-reversal may eliminate overlapping between the spectral curves of chemical species,<br>
thereby minimizing or destroying conditions of resonance.<br>
A reaction system may proceed down one reaction pathway or another, depending on<br>
the changes in spectral curves produced by the particle sizes. For example, a catalyst having<br>
a moderate particle size may proceed down a first reaction pathway while a larger size<br>
catalyst (or a conditioned participant) may direct the reaction down another reaction pathway.<br>
The changes in spectral curves and frequencies that accompany changes in catalyst<br>
size and shape are relevant for practical applications. Industrial catalysts are manufactured in<br>
a range of sizes and shapes, depending on the design requirements of the process and the type<br>
of reactor used. Catalyst activity is typically proportional to the. surface area of the catalyst<br>
bed in the reactor. Surface area increases as the size of the catalyst particles decreases.<br>
Seemingly, the smaller the catalyst particles, the better for industrial applications. This is not<br>
always the case, however. When a very fine bed of catalyst particles is used, high pressures<br>
may be required to force the reacting chemicals across or through the catalyst bed. The<br>
chemicals enter the catalyst bed under high pressure, and exit the bed (e.g., the other side) at<br>
a lower pressure. This large difference between entry and exit pressures is called a "pressure<br>
drop". A compromise is often required between catalyst size, catalyst activity, and pressure<br>
drop across the catalyst bed.<br>
The use of spectral catalysts according to the present invention allows for much finer<br>
tuning of this compromise. For example, a large catalyst size can be used so that pressure<br>
drops across the catalyst bed are minimized. At the same time, the high level of catalyst<br>
activity obtained with a smaller catalyst size can still be obtained by, for example,<br>
augmenting the physical catalyst with at least a portion of one or more spectral catalyst(s).<br>
For example, assume that a 10mm average particle size catalyst has 50% of the<br>
activity of a 5mm average particle size catalyst. With a 5mm-diameter catalyst, however, the<br>
pressure drop across the reactor may be so large that the reaction cannot be economically<br>
performed. The compromise in historical processes has typically been to use twice as much<br>
of the 10mm catalyst, to obtain the same, or approximately the same, amount of activity as<br>
with the original amount of 5mm catalyst. However, an alternative desirable approach is to<br>
use the original amount of 10mm physical catalyst and augment the physical catalyst with at<br>
least a portion of at least one spectral catalyst. Catalyst activity can be effectively doubled<br>
(or increased even more) by the spectral catalyst, resulting in approximately the same degree<br>
of activity (or perhaps even greater activity) as with the 5mm catalyst. Thus, the present<br>
invention permits the size of the catalyst to be larger, while retaining favorable reactor vessel<br>
pressure conditions so that the reaction can be performed economically, using half as much<br>
(or less) physical catalyst as compared to traditional prior art approaches.<br>
Another manner to approach the problem of pressure drops in physical catalyst beds,<br>
is to eliminate the physical catalyst completely. For example, in another embodiment of the<br>
invention, a fiberoptic sieve, (e.g., one with very large pores) can be used in a flow-through<br>
reactor vessel. If the pore size is designed to be large enough there can be virtually no<br>
pressure drop across the sieve, compared to a pressure drop accompanying the use of a 5 mm<br>
diameter or even a 10 mm diameter physical catalyst discussed above. According to the<br>
present invention, the spectral catalyst can be emitted through the fiberoptic sieve, thus<br>
catalyzing the reacting species as they flow by. This improvement over the prior art<br>
approaches has significant processing implications including lower costs, higher rates and<br>
improved safety, to mention only a few.<br>
Industrial catalysts are also manufactured in a range of shapes, as well as sizes.<br>
Shapes include spheres, irregular granules, pellets, extrudate, and rings. Some shapes are<br>
more expensive to manufacture than others, while some shapes have superior properties (e.g.,<br>
catalyst activity, strength, and less pressure drop) than others. While spheres are inexpensive<br>
to manufacture, a packed bed of spheres produces high-pressure drops and the spheres are<br>
typically not very strong. Physical catalyst rings on the other hand, have superior strength<br>
and activity and produce very little pressure drop, but they are also relatively expensive to<br>
produce.<br>
"Spectral energy catalysts permit a greater flexibility in choosing catalyst shape. For<br>
example, instead of using a packed bed of inexpensive spheres, with the inevitable high<br>
pressure drop and resulting mechanical damage to the catalyst particles, a single layer of<br>
spheres augmented, for example, with a spectral energy catalyst can be used. This catalyst is<br>
inexpensive, activity is maintained, and large pressure drops are not produced, thus<br>
preventing mechanical damage and extending the useful life of physical catalyst spheres.<br>
Similarly, far smaller numbers of catalyst rings can be used while obtaining the same or<br>
greater catalyst activity by, for example, supplementing with at least a portion of a spectral<br>
catalyst. The process can proceed at a faster flow-through rate because the catalyst bed will<br>
be smaller relative to a bed that is not augmented with a spectral catalyst.<br>
The use of spectral energy catalysts and/or spectral environmental reaction conditions<br>
to augment existing physical catalysts has the following advantages:<br>
- permit: the use of less expensive shaped catalyst particles;<br>
- permit the use of fewer catalyst particles overall;<br>
- permit the use of stronger shapes of catalyst particles; and<br>
- permit the use of catalyst particle shapes with better pressure drop characteristics.<br>
Their use to replace existing physical catalysts has similar advantages:<br>
- eliminate the use and expense of catalyst particles altogether;<br>
- allow use of spectral catalyst delivery systems that are stronger; and<br>
- delivery systems can be designed to incorporate superior pressure drop<br>
characteristics.<br>
Catalyst size and shape are also important to spectral emission patterns because all<br>
objects have an NOF depending on their size and shape. The smaller an object is in<br>
dimension, the higher its NOF will be in frequency (because speed = length x frequency).<br>
Also, two (2) objects of the same size, but different shape will have different NOF's (e.g., the<br>
resonant NOF frequency of a 1.0 m diameter sphere, is different from the NOF for a 1.0 m<br>
edged cube). Wave energies (both acoustic and EM) will have unique resonant frequencies<br>
for particular objects. The objects, such as physical catalyst particles or powder granules of<br>
reactants in a slurry, will act like antennas, absorbing and emitting energies at their<br>
structurally resonant frequencies. With this understanding, one is further able to manipulate<br><br>
and control the size and shape of holoreaction system components (e.g., physical catalysts,<br>
reactants, etc.) to achieve desired effects. For example, a transient for a desired reaction<br>
pathway may produce a spectral rotational frequency of 30 GHz. Catalyst spheres lcm in<br>
diameter with structural EM resonant frequency of 30 GHz (3x108m/s lx10-2m = 30x109Hz),<br>
can be used to catalyze the reaction. The catalyst particles will structurally resonate with the<br>
rotational frequency of the transient, providing energy to the transient and catalyzing the<br>
reaction. Likewise, the structurally resonant catalyst particles may be further energized by a<br>
spectral energy catalyst, such as, for example, 30 GHz microwave radiation. Thus<br>
understood, the spectral dynamics of chemical reactions can be much more precisely<br>
controlled than in prior art trial and error approaches.<br>
SOLVENTS<br>
Typically, the term solvent is applied to mixtures for which the solvent is a liquid,<br>
however, it should be understood that solvents may also comprise solids, liquids, gases or<br>
plasmas and/or mixtures and/or components thereof. The prior art typically groups liquid<br>
solvents into three broad classes: aqueous, organic, and non-aqueous. If an aqueous solvent<br>
is used, it means that the solvent is water. Organic solvents include hydrocarbons such as<br>
alcohols and ethers. Non-aqueous solvents include inorganic non-water substances. Many<br>
catalyzed reactions take place in solvents.<br>
Because solvents are themselves composed of atoms, molecules and/or ions they can<br>
have pronounced effects on chemical reactions. Solvents are comprised of matter and they<br>
emit their own spectral frequencies. The present invention teaches that these solvent<br>
frequencies undergo the same basic processes discussed earlier, including heterodyning,<br>
resonance, and harmonics. Spectroscopists have known for years that a solvent can<br>
dramatically affect the spectral frequencies produced by its' solutes. Likewise, chemists have<br>
known for years that solvents can affect catalyst activity. However, the spectroscopists and<br>
chemists in the prior art have apparently not associated these long studied changes in solute<br>
frequencies with changes in catalyst activity. The present invention recognizes that these<br>
changes in solute spectral frequencies can affect catalyst activity and chemical reactions<br>
and/or reaction pathways in general, changes include spectral curve broadening. Changes of<br>
curve intensity, gradual or abrupt shifting of the resonant frequency fo, and even abrupt<br>
rearrangement of resonant frequencies.<br>
Further, the present invention recognizes that one or more spectral frequencies in a<br>
solvent may be targeted by a spectral energy pattern or spectral energy conditioning pattern to<br>
change one or more properties of the solvent, and hence may change the reaction and energy<br>
dynamics in a holoreaction system. Similarly, a spectral energy pattern or a spectral energy<br>
conditioning pattern may be applied to a solute, causing a change in one or more properties of<br>
the solute, solvent, or solute/solvent system, and hence may change the reaction and energy<br>
dynamics in a holoreaction system.<br>
When reviewing Figure 24a, the solid line represents a portion of the spectral pattern<br>
of phthalic acid in alcohol while the dotted line represents phthalic acid in the solvent hexane.<br>
Consider a reaction taking place in alcohol, in which the catalyst resonates with phthalic acid<br>
at a frequency of 1,250, the large solid curve in the middle. If the solvent is changed to<br>
hexane, the phthalic acid no longer resonates at a frequency of 1,250 and the catalyst can not<br>
stimulate and energize it. The change in solvent will render the catalyst ineffective.<br>
Similarly, in reference to Figure 24b, iodine produces a high intensity curve at 580<br>
when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride, as shown in curve B. In alcohol, as shown by curve<br>
A the iodine produces instead, a moderate intensity curve at 1,050 and a low intensity curve<br>
at 850. Accordingly, assume that a reaction uses a spectral catalyst that resonates directly<br>
with the iodine in carbon tetrachloride at 580. If the spectral catalyst does not change and the<br>
solvent is changed to alcohol, the spectral catalyst will no longer function because<br>
frequencies no longer match and energy will not transfer. Specifically, the spectral catalyst's<br>
frequency of 580 will no longer match and resonate with the new iodine frequencies of 850<br>
and 1,050.<br>
However, there is the possibility that the catalyst will change its spectral pattern with<br>
a change in the solvent. The catalyst could change in a similar manner to the iodine, in which<br>
case the catalyst may continue to catalyze the reaction regardless of the change in solvent.<br>
Conversely, the spectral catalyst pattern could change in a direction opposite to the spectral<br>
pattern of the iodine. In this instance, the catalyst will again fail to catalyze the original<br>
reaction. There is also the possibility that the change in the catalyst could bring the catalyst<br>
into resonance with a different chemical species and help the reaction proceed down an<br>
alternative reaction pathway.<br>
Finally, consider the graph in Figure 24c, which shows a variety of solvent mixtures<br>
ranging from 100% benzene at the far left, to a 50:50 mixture of benzene and alcohol in the<br>
center, to 100% alcohol at the far right. The solute is phenylazophenol. The<br>
phenylazophenol has a frequency of S55-860 for most of the solvent mixtures. For a 50:50<br>
benzene:alcohol mixture the frequency is 855; or for a 98:2 benzene:alcohol mixture the<br>
frequency is still 855. However, at 99.5:0.5 benzene:alcohol mixture, the frequency abruptly changes to about 865. A catalyst active in 100% benzene by resonating with the<br>
phenylazophenol at 865, will lose its activity if there is even a slight amount of alcohol (e.g.,<br>
0.5%) in the solvent.<br>
Thus understood, the principles of spectral chemistry presented herein can be applied<br>
to catalysis, and reactions and/or reaction pathways in general. Instead of using the prior art<br>
trial and error approach to the choice of solvents and/or other holoreaction system<br>
components, solvents can be tailored and/or modified to optimize the spectral environmental<br>
reaction conditions. For example, a reaction may have a key reaction participant which<br>
resonates at 400 THz, while the catalyst resonates at 800 THz transferring energy<br>
harmonically. Changing the solvent may cause the resonant frequencies of both the<br>
participant and the catalyst to abruptly shift to 600 THz. There the catalyst would resonate<br>
directly with the participant, transferring even more energy, and catalyzing the holoreaction<br>
system more efficiently.<br>
Fuither, the properties of solvents, solutes, and solvent/solute systems may be affected<br>
by spectral energy providers. Water is the universal solvent It is commonly known and<br>
understood that if water is heated, its kinetic energy increases, and hence, the rate at which<br>
solutes dissolve also increases. After a solute has been added to a solvent, such as water,<br>
physical properties such as pH and conductivity change at a rate related to their kinetic<br>
energy and the temperature of the solute/solvent system.<br>
A novel aspect of the present invention is the understanding that the properties of<br>
solvents, solutes and solvent/solute systems may be affected and controlled by spectral<br>
energy providers outside the realm of simple thermal or kinetic mechanisms. For example,<br>
water at about 28°C will dissolve salt (sodium chloride) at a particular rate. Water at about<br>
28°C which has been conditioned with its own vibrational overtones will dissolve salt faster,<br>
even though there is no apparent difference in temperature. Similarly, if salt is added to<br>
water, there is a predictable rate of change in the pH and conductivity of the solution. If the<br>
water is conditioned or spectrally activated with its own vibrational overtones, either before<br>
or after, respectively, the addition of the salt, the rate of change of pH and conductivity is<br>
enhanced even though there is no difference in temperature. These effects are shown in<br>
greater detail in the Examples section herein.<br>
Further, if the salt is conditioned with some of its own electronic frequencies prior to<br>
adding it to water, the rate of change of conductivity is again enhanced, even though there is<br>
again no apparent difference in temperature. These effects are shown in greater detail in the<br>
Examples section herein.<br>
In general, delivery of spectral energy patterns and/or spectral energy conditioning<br>
patterns to solvents, solutes, and solvents/solute systems change the energy conditioning<br>
patterns to solvents, solutes; and solvent/solute systems may change the energy dynamics of<br>
the solvent and/or solute and hence their properties in a holoreaction system. These spectral<br>
techniques disclosed herein can be used to control many aspects of matter transformations<br>
such as chemical reactions, phase changes, and material properties (all of which are described<br>
in the Examples section herein).<br>
SUPPORT MATERIALS<br>
Catalysts can be either unsupported or supported. An unsupported catalyst is a<br>
formulation of the pure catalyst, with substantially no other molecules present. Unsupported<br>
catalysts are rarely used industrially because these, catalysts generally have low surface area<br>
and hence low activity. The low surface area can result from, for example, sintering, or<br>
coalescence of small molecules of the catalyst into larger particles in a process which reduces<br>
surface tension of the particles. An example of an unsupported catalyst is platinum alloy<br>
gauze, which is sometimes used for the selective oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide.<br>
Another example is small silver granules, sometimes used to catalyze the reaction of<br>
methanol with air, to form formaldehyde. When the use of unsupported catalysts is possible,<br>
their advantages include straightforward fabrication and relatively simple installation in<br>
various industrial processes.<br>
A supported catalyst is a formulation of the catalyst with other particles, the other<br>
particles acting as a supporting skeleton for the catalyst. Traditionally, the support particles<br>
are thought to be inert, thus providing a simple physical scaffolding for the catalyst<br>
molecules. Thus, one of the traditional functions of the support material is to give the<br>
catalyst shape and mechanical strength. The support material is also said to reduce sintering<br>
rates. If the catalyst support is finely divided similar to the catalyst, the support will act as a<br>
"spacer" between the catalyst particles, and hence prevent sintering. An alternative theory<br>
holds that an interaction takes place between the catalyst and support, thereby preventing<br>
sinteiing. This theory is supported by the many observations that catalyst activity is altered<br>
by changes in support material structure and composition.<br>
Supported catalysts are generally made by one or more of the following three<br>
methods: impregnation, precipitation, and/or crystallization. Impregnation techniques use<br>
preformed support materials, which are then exposed to a solution containing the catalyst or<br>
its precursors. The catalyst or precursors diffuse into the pores of the support. Heating, or<br>
another conversion process, drives off the solvent and transforms the catalyst or precursors<br>
into the final catalyst. The most common support materials for impregnation are refractory<br>
oxides such as aluminas and aluminum hydrous oxides. These support materials have found<br>
their greatest use for catalysts that must operate under extreme conditions such as steam<br>
reforming, because they have reasonable mechanical strengths.<br>
Precipitation techniques use concentrated solutions of catalyst salts (e.g., usually<br>
metal salts). The salt solutions are rapidly mixed and then allowed to precipitate in a finely<br>
divided form. The precipitate is then prepared using a variety of processes including<br>
washing, filtering, drying, heating, and pelleting. Often a graphitic lubricant is added.<br>
Precipitated catalysts have high catalytic activity secondary to high surface area, but they are<br>
generally not as strong as impregnated catalysts.<br>
Crystallization techniques produce support materials called zeolites. The structure of<br>
these crystallized catalyst zeolites is based on SiO4 and AlO4 (see Figure 25 a which shows<br>
the tetrahedral units of silicon; and Figure 25b which shows the tetrahedral units of<br>
aluminum). These units link in different combinations to form structural families, which<br>
include rings, chains, and complex polyhedra. For example, the SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahderal<br>
units can form truncated octahedron structures, which form the building blocks for A, X, and<br>
Y zeolites (see Figure 26a which shows a truncated octahedron structure with lines<br>
representing oxygen atoms and comers are Al or Si atoms; Figure 26b which shows zeolite<br>
with joined truncated octahedrons joined by oxygen bridges between square faces; and Figure<br>
26c which shows zeolites X and Y with joined truncated octahedrons joined by oxygen<br>
bridges between hexagonal faces).<br>
The crystalline structure of zeolites gives them a well defined pore size and structure.<br>
This differs from the varying pore sizes found in impregnated or precipitated support<br>
materials. Zeolite crystals are made by mixing solutions of silicates and aluminates and the<br>
catalyst. Crystallization is generally induced by heating (see spectral effects of temperature<br>
in the Section entitled "Temperature"). The structure of the resulting zeolite depends on the<br>
silicon/aluminum ratio, their concentration, the presence of added catalyst, the temperature,<br>
and even the size of the reaction vessels used, all of which are environmental reaction<br>
conditions. Zeolites generally have greater specificity than other catalyst support materials<br>
(e.g., they do not just speed up the reaction). They also may steer the reaction towards a<br>
particular reaction pathway.<br>
Support materials can affect the activity of a catalyst. Traditionally, the prior art has<br>
attributed these effects to geometric factors. However, according to the present invention,<br>
there are spectral factors to consider as well. It has been well established that solvents affect<br>
the spectral patterns produced by their solutes. Solvents can be liquids, solids, gases and/or<br>
plasmas Support materials can, in many cases, be viewed as nothing more than solid solvents<br>
for catalysts. As such, support materials can affect the spectral patterns produced by their<br>
solute catalysts.<br>
Just as dissolved sugar can be placed into a solid phase solvent (ice), catalysts can be<br>
placed into support materials that are solid phase solvents. These support material solid<br>
solvents can have similar spectral effects on catalysts that liquid solvents have. Support<br>
materials can change spectral frequencies of their catalyst solutes by, for example, causing<br>
spectral curve broadening, changing of curve intensity, gradual or abrupt shifting of the<br>
resonant frequency fo, and even abrupt rearrangement of resonant frequencies.<br>
Further, use of spectral techniques to affect matter transformations are not limited to<br>
solvent/solute or support/catalysts systems, but rather apply broadly to all material systems<br>
and phases of matter, and their respective properties (e.g., chemical, physical, electrical,<br>
magnetic, thermal, etc.).<br>
The use of targeted spectral techniques in numerous materials systems (including<br>
solid, liquid, and gas) to control chemical reactions, phase changes and material properties<br>
(e.g., chemical, physical, electrical, thermal, etc.) is described more fully in the Examples<br>
section later herein.<br>
Support materials can be simply viewed as solid solvents for their catalyst solutes.<br>
The present invention teaches that spectral techniques can be used to control many aspects of<br>
matter transformation in solvent/solute systems such as chemical reactions, phase changes,<br>
and material properties. Similarly, spectral techniques can be used to control many aspects<br>
such as chemical reactions, phase changes, and material properties of support/catalyst<br>
systems. These spectral techniques can be used to affect the synthesis of support/catalyst<br>
systems, or to affect the subsequent properties of the support/catalyst system in a holoreaction<br>
system.<br>
Thus, due to the disclosure herein, it should become clear to an artisan of ordinary<br>
skill that changes in support materials (or conditioning support materials) can have dramatic<br>
effects on catalyst activity. The support materials affect the spectral frequencies produced by<br>
the catalysts. The changes in catalyst spectral frequencies produce varying effects on<br>
chemical reactions and catalyst activity, including accelerating the rate of reaction and also<br>
guiding the reaction on a particular reaction path. Thus support materials can potentially<br>
influence the matching of frequencies and can thus favor the possibility of transferring energy<br>
between reaction system components and/or spectral energy patterns, thus permitting certain<br>
reactions to occur and/or favorably modify reaction rates.<br>
POISONING<br>
Poisoning of catalysts occurs when the catalyst activity is reduced by adding a small<br>
amount of another constituent, such as a chemical species. The prior art has attributed<br>
poisoning to chemical species that contain excess electrons (e.g., electron donor materials)<br>
and to adsorption of poisons onto the physical catalyst surface where the poison physically<br>
blocks reaction sites. However, neither of these theories satisfactorily explains poisoning.<br>
Consider the case of nickel hydrogenation catalysts. These physical catalysts are<br>
substantially deactivated if only 0.1% sulphur compounds by weight are adsorbed onto them.<br>
It is difficult to believe that 0.1% sulphur by weight could contribute so many electrons as to<br>
inactivate the nickel catalyst. Likewise, it is difficult to believe that the presence of 0.1%<br>
sulphur by weight occupies so many reaction sites that it completely deactivates the catalyst.<br>
Accordingly, neither prior art explanation is satisfying.<br>
Poisoning phenomena can be more logically understood in terms of spectral<br>
chemistry. In reference to the example in the Solvent Section using a benzene solvent and<br>
phenylazophenol as the solute, in pure benzene the phenylazophenol had a spectral frequency<br>
of S65 Hz. The addition of just a few drops of alcohol (0.5%) abruptly changed the<br>
phenylazophenol frequency to 855. If the expectation was for the phenylazophenol to<br>
resonate at 865, then the alcohol would have poisoned that particular reaction. The addition<br>
of small quantities of other chemical species can change the resonant frequencies (fo) of<br>
catalysts and reacting chemicals. The addition of another chemical species can act as a<br>
poison to take the catalyst and reacting species out of resonance (i.e., the presence of the<br>
additional species can remove any substantial overlapping of frequencies and thus prevent<br>
any significant transfer of energy).<br>
Besides changing resonant frequencies of chemical species, adding small amounts of<br>
other chemicals can also affect the spectral intensities of the catalyst and, for example, other<br>
atoms and molecules in the holoreaction system by either increasing or decreasing the<br>
spectral intensities. Consider cadmium and zinc mixed in an alumina-silica precipitate (see<br>
Figure 27 which shows the influences of copper and bismuth on the zinc/cadmium line ratio).<br>
A normal ratio between the cadmium3252.5 spectral line and the zinc 3345.0 spectral line<br>
was determined. The addition of sodium, potassium, lead, and magnesium had little or no<br>
effect on the Cd/Zn intensity ratio. However, the addition of copper reduced the relative<br>
intensity of the zinc line and increased the cadmium intensity. Conversely, addition of<br>
bismuth increased the relative intensity of the zinc line while decreasing cadmium.<br>
Also, consider the effect of small amounts of magnesium on a copper-aluminum<br>
mixture (see Figure 28 which shows the influence of magnesium on the copper aluminum<br>
intensity ratio). Magnesium present at 0.6%, caused significant reductions in line intensity<br>
for copper and for aluminum. At 1.4% magnesium, the spectral intensities for both copper<br>
and aluminum were reduced by about a third. If the copper frequency is important for<br>
catalyzing a reaction, adding this small amount of magnesium would dramatically reduce the<br>
catalyst activity. Thus, it could be concluded that the copper catalyst had been poisoned by<br>
the magnesium.<br>
In summary, poisoning effects on catalysts are due to spectral changes. Adding a<br>
small amount of another chemical species to a physical catalyst and/or reaction system can<br>
change the resonance frequencies or the spectral intensities of one or more chemical species<br>
(e.g., reactant). The catalyst might remain the same, while a crucial intermediate is changed.<br>
Likewise, the catalyst might change, while the intermediate stays the same. They might both<br>
change, or they might both stay the same and be oblivious to the added poison species. This<br>
understanding is important to achieving the goals of the present invention which include<br>
targeting species to cause an overlap in frequencies, or in this instance, specifically targeting<br>
one or more species so as to prevent any substantial overlap in frequencies and thus prevent<br>
reactions from occurring by blocking the transfer of energy.<br>
PROMOTERS<br>
Just as adding a small amount of another chemical species to a catalyst and<br>
holoreaction system can poison the activity of the catalyst, the opposite can also happen.<br>
When an added species enhances the activity of a catalyst, it is called a promoter. For<br>
instance, adding a few percent calcium and potassium oxide to iron-alumina compounds<br>
promotes activity of the iron catalyst for ammonia synthesis. Promoters act by all the<br>
mechanisms discussed previously in the Sections entitled Solvents, Support Materials, and<br>
Poisoning. Not surprisingly, some support materials actually are promoters. Promoters<br>
enhance catalysts and specific reactions and/or reaction pathways by changing spectral<br>
frequencies and intensities. While a catalyst poison takes the reacting species out of<br>
resonance (i.e., the frequencies do not overlap), the promoter brings them into resonance (i.e.,<br>
the frequencies do overlap). Likewise, instead of reducing the spectral intensity of crucial<br>
frequencies, the promoter may increase the crucial intensities.<br>
Thus, if it was desired for phenylazophenol to react at 85.5 in a benzene solvent,<br>
alcohol could be added and the alcohol would be termed a promoter. If it was desired for the<br>
phenylazophenol too react at 865, alcohol could be added and the alcohol could be<br>
considered a poison. Thus understood, the differences between poisons and promoters are a<br>
matter of perspective, and depend on which reaction pathways and/or reaction products are<br>
desired. They both act by the same underlying spectral chemistry mechanisms of the present<br>
invention.<br>
CONCENTRATIONS<br>
Concentrations of chemical species are known to affect reaction rates and dynamics.<br>
Concentration also affects catalyst activity. The prior art explains these effects by the<br>
probabilities that various chemical species will collide with each other. At high<br>
concentrations of a particular species, there are many individual atoms or molecules present.<br>
The more atoms or molecules present, the more likely they are to collide with something else.<br>
However, this statistical treatment by the prior art does not explain the entire situation.<br>
Figure 29 shows various concentrations of N-methyl urethane in a carbon tetrachloride<br>
solution. At low concentrations, the spectral lines have a relatively low intensity. However,<br>
as the concentration is increased, the intensities of the spectral curves increase also. At 0.01<br>
molarity, the spectral curve at 3,460 cm-1 is the only prominent frequency. However, at 0.15<br>
molarity, the curves at 3,370 and 3,300 cm-1 are also prominent.<br>
As the concentration of a chemical species is changed, the spectral character of that<br>
species in the reaction mixture changes also. Suppose that 3,300 and 3,370 cm-1 are<br>
important frequencies for a desired reaction pathway. At low concentrations the desired<br>
reaction pathway will not occur. However, if the concentrations are increased (and hence the<br>
intensities of the relevant frequencies) the reaction will proceed down the desired pathway.<br>
Concentration is also related to solvents, support structures, poisons and promoters, as<br>
previously discussed.<br>
FINE STRUCTURE FREQUENCIES<br>
The field of science concerned generally with measuring the frequencies of energy<br>
and matter, known as spectroscopy, has already been discussed herein. Specifically, the three<br>
broad classes of atomic and molecular spectra were reviewed. Electronic spectra, which are<br>
due to electron transitions, have frequencies primarily in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and<br>
infrared (IR) regions, and occur in atoms and molecules. Vibrational spectra, which are due<br>
to, for example, bond motion between individual atoms within molecules, are primarily in the<br>
IR, and occur in molecules. Rotational spectra are due primarily to rotation of molecules in<br>
space and have microwave or radiowave frequencies, and also occur in molecules.<br>
The previous discussion of various spectra and spectroscopy has been oversimplified.<br>
There are actually at least three additional sets of spectra, which comprise the spectrum<br>
discussed above herein, namely, the fine structure spectra and the hyperfine structure spectra<br>
and the superfine structure spectra. These spectra occur in atoms and molecules, and extend,<br>
for example, from the ultraviolet down to the low radio regions. These spectra are often<br>
mentioned in prior art chemistry and spectroscopy books typically as an aside, because prior<br>
art chemists typically focus more on the traditional types of spectroscopy, namely, electronic,<br>
vibrational, and rotational.<br>
The fine and hyperfine spectra are quite prevalent in the areas of physics and radio<br>
astronomy. For example, cosmologists map the locations of interstellar clouds of hydrogen,<br>
and collect data regarding the origins of the universe by detecting signals from outerspace,<br>
for example, at 1.420 GHz, a microwave frequency which is one of the hyperfine splitting<br>
frequencies for hydrogen. Most of the large databases concerning the microwave and radio<br>
frequencies of molecules and atoms have been developed by astronomers and physicists,<br>
rather than by chemists. This apparent gap between the use by chemists and physicists, of the<br>
fine and hyperfine spectra in chemistry, has apparently resulted in pnor art chemists not<br>
giving much, if any, attention to these portentially useful spectra.<br>
Referring again to Figures 9a and 9b, the Balmer series (i.e., frequency curve II),<br>
begins with a frequency of 456 THz (see Figure 30a). Closer examination of this individual<br>
frequency shows that instead of there being just one crisp narrow curve at 456 THz, there are<br>
really seven different curves very close together that comprise the curve at 456 THz. The<br>
seven (7) different curves are fine structure frequencies. Figure 30b shows the emission<br>
spectrum for the 456 THz curve in hydrogen. A high-resolution laser saturation spectrum,<br>
shown in Figure 31, gives even more detail. These seven different curves, which are<br>
positioned very close together, are generally referred to as a multiplet.<br>
Although there are seven different fine structure frequencies shown, these seven<br>
frequencies are grouped around two major frequencies. These are the two, tall, relatively<br>
high intensity curves shown in Figure 30b. These two high intensity curves are also shown in<br>
Figure 31 at zero cm-1 (456.676 THz), and at relative wavenumber 0.34 cm-1 (456.686 THz).<br>
What appears to be a single frequency of (456 THz), is actually composed predominantly of<br>
two slightly different frequencies (456.676 and 456.686 THz), and the two frequencies are<br>
typically referred to as doublet and the frequencies are said to be split. The difference or split<br>
between the two predominant frequencies in the hydrogen 456 THz doublet is 0.010 THz<br>
(100 THz) or 0.34 cm-1 wavnumbers. This difference frequency, 10 GHz, is called the fine<br>
splitting frequency for the 456 THz frequency of hydrogen.<br>
Thus, the individual frequencies that are typically shown in ordinary electronic<br>
spectra are composed of two or more distinct frequencies spaced very close together. The<br>
distinct frequencies spaced very close together are called fine structure frequencies. The<br>
difference, between two fine structure frequencies that are split apart by a very slight amount,<br>
is a fine splitting frequency (see Figure 32 which shows f1 and f2 which comprise fo and<br>
which are shown as underneath fo. The difference between f1 and f2 is known as the fine<br>
splitting frequency). This "difference" between two fine structure frequencies is important<br>
because such a difference between any two frequencies is a heterodyne.<br>
Almost all the hydrogen frequencies shown in Figures 9a and 9b are doublets or<br>
multiplets. This means that almost all the hydrogen electronic spectrum frequencies have<br>
fine structure frequencies and fine splitting frequencies (which means that these heterodynes<br>
are available to be used as spectral catalysts, if desired). The present invention discloses that<br>
these "(differences" or heterodynes can be quite useful for certain reactions. However, prior<br>
to discussing the use of these heterodynes, in the present invention, more must be understood<br>
about these heterodynes. Some of the fine splitting frequencies (i.e., heterodynes) for<br>
hydrogen are listed in Table 3. These fine splitting heterodynes range from the microwave<br>
down into the upper reaches of the radio frequency region.<br>
There are more than 23 fine splitting frequencies (i.e , heterodynes) for just the first<br>
series or curve I in hydrogen. Lists of the fine splitting heterodynes can be found, for<br>
example, in the classic 1949 reference "Atomic Energy Levels" by Charlotte Moore. This<br>
reference also lists 133 fine splitting heterodyned intervals for carbon, whose frequencies<br>
range from 14.1 THz (473.3 cm-1) down to 12.2. GHz (0.41 cm-1). Oxygen has 287 fine<br>
splitting heterodynes listed from 15.9 THz (532.5 cm-1) down to 3.88 GHz (0.13 cm-1). The<br>
23 platinum fine splitting intervals detailed are from 23.3 THz (775.9 cm-1) to 8.62 THz in<br>
frequency (287.9 cm-1).<br>
Diagrammatically, the magnification and resolution of an electronic frequency into<br>
several closely spaced fine frequencies is depicted in Figure 33. The electronic orbit is<br>
designated by the orbital number n = 0, 1, 2. etc. The fine structure is designated as a. A<br>
quantum diagram for the hydrogen fine structure is shown in Figure 34. Specifically, shown<br>
is the fine structure of the n = 1 and n = 2 levels of the hydrogen atom. Figure 35 shows the<br>
multiplet splittings for the lowest energy levels of carbon, oxygen, and fluorine, as<br>
represented by "C", "O" and "F", respectively.<br>
In addition to the fine splitting frequencies for atoms (i.e., heterodynes), molecules<br>
also have similar fine structure frequencies. The origin and derivation for molecular fine<br>
structure and splitting is different from that for atoms, however, the graphical and practical<br>
results are quite similar. In atoms, the fine structure frequencies are said to result from the<br>
interaction of the spinning electron with its' own magnetic field. Basically, this means the<br>
electron cloud of a single atomic sphere, rotating and interacting with its' own magnetic field,<br>
produces the atomic fine structure frequencies. The prior art refers to this phenomena as<br>
"spin-orbit coupling". For molecules, the fine structure frequencies correspond to the actual<br>
rotational frequencies of the electronic or vibrational frequencies. So the fine structure<br>
frequencies for atoms and molecules both result from rotation. In the case of atoms, it is the<br>
atom spinning and rotating around itself, much the way the earth rotates around its axis. In<br>
the case of molecules, it is the molecule spinning and rotating through space.<br>
Figure 36 shows the infrared absorption spectrum of the SF6 vibration band near 28.3<br>
THz (10.6 um wavelength, wavenumber 948 cm-1) of the SF6 molecule. The molecule is<br>
highly symmetrical and rotates somewhat like a top. The spectral tracing was obtained with a<br>
high resolution grating spectrometer. There is a broad band between 941 and 952 cm"1 (28.1<br>
and 23.5 THz) with three sharp spectral curves at 946, 947, and 948 cm-1 (28.3, 28.32, and<br>
23.834 THz).<br>
Figure 37 a shows a narrow slice bemg taken from between 949 and 950 cm" , which<br>
is blown up to show more detail in Figure 37b. A tunable semiconductor diode laser was<br>
used to obtain the detail. There are many more spectral curves which appear when the<br>
spectrum is reviewed in finer detail. These curves are called the fine structure frequencies for<br>
this molecule. The total energy of an atom or molecule is the sum of its' electronic,<br>
vibrational, and rotational energies. Thus, the simple Planck equation discussed previously<br>
herein:<br>
E = hv<br>
can be rewritten as follows:<br>
E = Ee + Ev + E r<br>
where E is the total energy, Ee is the electronic energy, E? is the vibrational energy, and Er is<br>
the rotational energy. Diagrammatically, this equation is shown in Figure 38 for molecules.<br>
The electronic energy, Ee, involves a change in the orbit of one of the electrons in the<br>
molecule. It is designated by the orbital number n = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. The vibrational energy,<br>
Ev, is produced by a change in the vibration rate between two atoms within the molecule, and<br>
is designated by a vibrational number v = 1, 2, 3, etc. Lastly, the rotational energy, Er, is the<br>
energy of rotation caused by the molecule rotating around its' center of mass. The rotational<br>
energy is designated by the quantum number J = 1, 2, and 3, etc., as determined from angular<br>
momentum equations.<br>
Thus, by examining the vibrational frequencies of SF6 in more detail, the fine<br>
structure molecular frequencies become apparent. These fine structure frequencies are<br>
actually produced by the molecular rotations, "J", as a subset of each vibrational frequency.<br>
Just as the rotational levels "J" are substantially evenly separated in Figure 38, they are also<br>
substantially evenly separated when plotted as frequencies.<br>
This concept may be easier to understand by viewing some additional frequency<br>
diagrams. For example, Figure 39a shows the pure rotational absorption spectrum for<br>
gaseous hydrogen-chloride and Figure 39b shows the same spectrum at low resolution. In<br>
Figure 39a, the separate waves, that look something like teeth on a "comb", correspond to the<br>
individual rotational frequencies. The complete wave (i.e.. that wave comprising the whole<br>
comb) that extends in frequency from 20 to 500 cm-1 corresponds to the entire vibrational<br>
frequency. At low resolution or magnification, this set of rotational frequencies appear to be<br>
a single frequency peaking at about 20 cm-1 (598 GHz) (see Figure 39b). This is very similar<br>
to the way atomic frequencies such as the 456 THz hydrogen frequency appear (i.e., just one<br>
frequency at low resolution, that turn out to be several different frequencies at higher<br>
magnification).<br>
In Figure 40, the rotational spectrum (i.e., fine structure) of hydrogen cyanide is<br>
shown, where "J" is the rotational level. Note again, the regular spacing of the rotational<br>
levels. (Note that this spectrum is oriented opposite of what is typical). This spectrum uses<br>
transmission rather than emission on the horizontal Y-axis, thus, intensity increases<br>
downward on the Y-axis, rather than upwards.<br>
Additionally, Figure 41 shows the v1 - v5 vibrational bands for FCCF (where v1 is<br>
vibrational level 1 and V5 vibrational level 5) which includes a plurality of rotational<br>
frequencies. All of the fine sawtooth spikes are the fine structure frequencies which<br>
correspond to the rotational frequencies. Note the substantially regular spacing of the<br>
rotational frequencies. Also note, the undulating pattern of the rotational frequency intensity,<br>
as well as the alternating pattern of the rotational frequency intensities.<br>
Consider the actual rotational frequencies (i.e., fine structure frequencies) for the<br>
ground state of carbon monoxide listed in Table 4.<br>
Each of the rotational frequencies is regularly spaced at approximately 115 GHz<br>
apart. Prior art quantum theorists would explain this regular spacing as being due to the fact<br>
that the rotational frequencies are related to Planck's constant and the moment of inertia (i.e.,<br>
center of mass for the molecule) by the equation:<br><br>
where B is the rotational constant, h is Planck's constant, and I is the moment of inertia for<br>
the molecule. From there the prior art established a frequency equation for the rotational<br>
levels that corresponds to: <br>
where f is the frequency, B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational level. Thus, the<br>
rotational spectrum (i.e., fine structure spectrum) for a molecule turns out to be a harmonic<br>
series of lines with the frequencies all spaced or split (i.e., heterodyned) by the same amount.<br>
This amount has been referred to in the prior art as "2B", and "B" has been referred to as the<br>
"rotational constant". In existing charts and databases of molecular frequencies, "B" is<br>
usually listed as a frequency such as MHz. This is graphically represented for the first four<br>
rotational frequencies for CO in Figure 42.<br>
This fact is interesting for several reasons. The rotational constant "B", listed in many<br>
databases, is equal to one half of the difference between rotational frequencies for a molecule.<br><br>
That means that B is the first subharmonic frequency, to the fundamental frequency "2JB",<br>
which is the heterodyned difference between all the rotational frequencies. The rotational<br>
constant B listed for carbon monoxide is 57.6 GHz (57,635.970 MHz). This is basically half<br>
of the 115 GHz difference between the rotational frequencies. Thus, according to the present<br>
invention, if it is desired to stimulate a molecule's rotational levels, the amount "2B" can be<br>
used, because it is the fundamental first generation heterodyne. Alternatively, the same "B"<br>
can be used because "B" corresponds to the first subharmonic of that heterodyne.<br>
Further, the prior art teaches that if it is desired to use microwaves for stimulation, the<br>
microwave frequencies used will be restricted to stimulating levels at or near the ground state<br>
of the molecule (i.e., n = 0 in Figure 38). The prior art teaches that as you progress upward in<br>
Figure 38 to the higher electronic and vibrational levels, the required frequencies will<br>
correspond to the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet: regions. However, the prior art is wrong<br>
about this point.<br>
By referring to Figure 38 again, it is clear that the rotational frequencies are evenly<br>
spaced out no matter what electronic or vibrational level is under scrutiny. The even spacing<br>
shown in Figure 3S is due to the rotational frequencies being evenly spaced as progression is<br>
made upwards through all the higher vibrational and electronic levels. Table 5 lists the<br>
rotational frequencies for lithium fluoride (LiF) at several different rotational and vibrational<br>
levels.<br>
It is clear from Table 5 that the differences between rotational frequencies, no matter<br>
what the vibrational level, is about 86,000 to about 89,000 MHz (i.e., 86-89 GHz). Thus,<br>
according to the present invention, by using a microwave frequency between about 86,000<br>
MHz and 89,000 MHz, the molecule can be stimulated from the ground state level all the way<br>
up to its' highest energy levels. This effect has not been even remotely suggested by the prior<br>
art. Specifically, the rotational frequencies of molecules can be manipulated in a unique<br>
manner. The first rotational level has a natural oscillatory frequency (NOF) of 89,740 MHz.<br>
The second rotational level has an NOF of 179,470 MHz. Thus,<br><br>
Thus, the present invention has discovered that the NOF's of the rotational<br>
frequencies heterodyne by adding and subtracting in a manner similar to the manner that all<br>
frequencies heterodyne. Specifically, the two rotational frequencies heterodyne to produce a<br>
subtracted frequency. This subtracted frequency happens to be exactly twice as big as the<br>
derived rotational constant "B" listed in nuclear physics and spectroscopy manuals. Thus,<br>
when the first rotational frequency in the molecule is stimulated with the Subtracted<br>
Frequency rotational 2-1, the first rotational frequency will heterodyne (i.e., in this case add) with<br>
the NOFrotational o?1 (i.e., first rotational frequency) to produce NOFrotationai1?2, which is the<br>
natural oscillatory frequency of the molecule's second rotational level. In other words:<br><br>
Since the present invention has disclosed that the rotational frequencies are actually<br>
evenly spaced harmonics, the subtracted frequency will also add with the second level NOF<br>
to produce the third level NOF. The subtracted frequency will add with the third level NOF<br>
to produce the fourth level NOF. This procedure can be repeated over and over. Thus,<br>
according to the present invention, by using one single microwave frequency, it is possible to<br>
stimulate all the rotational levels in a vibratory band.<br>
Moreover, if all the rotational levels for a vibrational frequency are excited, then the<br>
vibrational frequency will also be correspondingly excited. Further, if all the vibrational<br>
levels for an electronic level are excited, then the electronic level will be excited as well.<br>
Thus, according to the teachings of the present invention, it is possible to excite the highest<br>
levels of the electronic and vibrational structure of a molecule by using a single microwave<br>
frequency. This is contrary to the prior art teachings that the use of microwaves is restricted<br>
to the ground state of the molecule. Specifically, if the goal is to resonate directly with an<br>
upper vibrational or electronic level, the prior art teaches that microwave frequencies can not<br>
be used. If, however, according to the present invention, a catalytic mechanism of action is<br>
initiated by, for example, resonating with target species indirectly through heterodynes, then<br>
one or more microwave frequencies can be used to energize at least one upper level<br>
vibrational or electronic state. Accordingly, by using the teachings of the present invention in<br>
conjunction with the simple processes of heterodyning it becomes readily apparent that<br>
microwave frequencies are not limited to the ground state levels of molecules.<br>
The present invention has determined that catalysts cam actually stimulate target<br>
species indirectly by utilizing at least one heterodyne frequency (e.g., harmonic). However,<br>
catalysts can also stimulate the target species by direct resonance with at least one<br>
fundamental frequency of interest. However, the rotational frequencies can result in use of<br>
both mechanisms. For example, Figure 42 shows a graphical representation of fine structure<br>
spectrum showing the first four rotational frequencies for CO in the ground state. The first<br>
rotational frequency for CO is 115 GHz. The heterodyned difference between rotational<br>
frequencies is also 115 GHz. The first rotational frequency and the heterodyned difference<br>
between frequencies are identical. All of the upper level rotational frequencies are harmonics<br>
of the first frequency. This relationship is not as apparent when one deals only with the<br>
rotational constant "B" of the prior art. However, frequency-based spectral chemistry<br>
analyses, like those of the present invention, makes such concepts easier to understand.<br>
Examination of the first level rotational frequencies for LiF shows that it is nearly<br>
identical to the heterodyned difference between it and the second level rotational frequency.<br>
The rotational frequencies are sequential harmonics of the first rotational frequency.<br>
Accordingly, if a molecule is stimulated with a frequency equal to 2B (i.e., a heterodyned<br>
harmonic difference between rotational frequencies) the present invention teaches that energy<br>
will resonate with all the upper rotational frequencies indirectly through heterodynes, and<br>
resonate directly with the first rotational frequency. This is an important discovery.<br>
The prior art discloses a number of constants used in spectroscopy that relate in some<br>
way or another to the frequencies of atoms and molecule, just as the rotational constant "B"<br>
relates to the harmonic spacing of rotational fine structure molecular frequencies. The alpha<br>
(a) rotation-vibration constant is a good example of this. The alpha rotation-vibration<br>
frequency constant is related to slight changes in the frequencies for the same rotational level,<br>
when the vibrational level changes. For example, Figure 43a shows the frequencies for the<br>
same rotational levels, but different vibrational levels for LiF. The frequencies are almost the<br>
same, but vary by a few percent between the different vibrational levels.<br>
Referring to Figure 43b, the differences between all the frequencies for the various<br>
rotational transitions at different vibrational levels of Figure 43a are shown. The rotational<br>
transition 0? 1 in the top line of Figure 43b has a frequency of 89,740.46 MHz at<br>
vibrational level 0. At vibrational level 1, the 0 -» 1 transition is 88,319.18 MHz. The<br>
difference between these two rotational frequencies is 1,421.28 MHz. At vibrational level 2,<br>
the 0 ? 1 transition is 86,921.20 MHz. The difference between it and the vibrational level 1<br>
frequency (88,319.18 MHz) is 1,397.98 MHz. These slight differences for the same J<br>
rotational level between different vibrational levels are nearly identical. For the J = 0 ? 1<br>
rotational level they center around a frequency of 1,400 MHz.<br>
For the J = 1 ? 2 transition, the differences center around 2,800 Hz, and for the<br>
J = 2 ? 3 transition, the differences center around 4,200 Hz. These different frequencies of<br>
1,400, 2,800 and 4,200,Hz etc., are all harmonics of each other. Further, they are all<br>
harmonics of the alpha rotation-vibration constant. Just as the actual molecular rotational<br>
frequencies are harmonics of the rotational constant B, the differences between the rotational<br>
frequencies are harmonics of the alpha rotation-vibration constant. Accordingly, if a<br>
molecule is stimulated with a frequency equal to the alpha vibration-rotation frequencies, the<br>
present invention teaches that energy will resonate with all the rotational frequencies<br>
indirectly through heterodynes. This is an important discovery.<br>
Consider the rotational and vibrational states for the triatomic molecule OCS shown<br>
in Figure 44. Figure 44 shows the same rotational level (J - 1 ? 2) for different vibrational<br>
states in the OCS molecule. For the ground vibrational (000) level, J = 1 ? 2 transition; and<br>
the excited vibrational state (100) J = 1 ? 2 transition, the difference between the two<br>
frequencies is equal to 4 X alphal (4a1). In another excited state, the frequency difference<br>
between the ground vibrational (000) level, J = 1 ? 2 transition, and the center of the two l-<br>
type doublets is 4 X alphas (4a1). In a higher excited vibrational state, the frequency<br>
difference between (000) and (02°0) is 8 X alpha2 (8a2). Thus, it can be seen that the<br>
rotation-vibration constants "a" are actually harmonics of molecular frequencies. Thus,<br>
according to the present invention, stimulating a molecule with an "a" frequency, or a<br>
harmonic of "a", will either directly resonate with or indirectly heterodyne harmonically<br>
with various rotational-vibrational frequencies of the molecule.<br>
Another interesting constant is the l-type doubling constant. This constant is also<br>
shown in Figure 44. Specifically, Figure 44 shows the rotational transition J = 1? 2 for the<br>
triatomic molecule OCS. Just as the atomic frequencies are sometimes split into doublets or<br>
multiplets, the rotational frequencies are also sometimes split into doublets. The difference<br>
between them is called the l-type doubling constant. These constants are usually smaller (i.e.,<br>
of a lower frequency) than the a constants. For the OCS molecule, the a constants are 20.56<br>
and 10.56 MHz while the l-type doubling constant is 6.3 MHz. These frequencies are all in<br>
the radiowave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
As discussed previously herein, energy is a-ansferred by two fundamental frequency<br>
mechanisms. If frequencies are substantially the same or match, then energy transfers by<br>
direct resonance. Energy can also transfer indirectly by heterodyning, (i.e., the frequencies<br>
substantially match after having been added or subtracted with another frequency). Further,<br>
as previously stated, the direct or indirect resonant frequencies do not have to match exactly.<br>
If they are merely close, significant amounts of energy will still transfer. Any of these<br>
constants or frequencies that are related to molecules or other matter via heterodynes, can be<br>
used to transfer, for example, energy to the matter and hence can directly interact with the<br>
matter.<br>
In the reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to form water, the<br>
present invention teaches that the energizing of the reaction intermediates of atomic hydrogen<br>
and the hydroxy radical are crucial to sustaining the reaction. In this regard, the physical<br>
catalyst platinum energizes both reaction intermediates by directly and indirectly resonating<br>
with them. Platinum also energizes the intermediates at multiple energy levels, creating the<br>
conditions for energy amplification. The present invention also teaches how to copy<br>
platinum's mechanism of action by making use of atomic fine structure frequencies.<br>
The invention has previously discussed resonating with the fine structure frequencies<br>
with only slight variations between the frequencies (e.g., 456.676 and 456.686 THz).<br>
However, indirectly resonating with the fine structure frequencies, is a significant difference.<br>
Specifically, by using the fine splitting frequencies, which are simply the differences or<br>
heterodynes between the fine structure frequencies, the present invention teaches that indirect<br>
resonance can be achieved. By examining the hydrogen 456 THz fine structure and fine<br>
splitting frequencies (see, for example, Figures 30 and 31 and Table 3 many heterodynes are<br>
shown). In other words, the difference between the fine structure frequencies can be<br>
calculated as follows:<br>
456.686 THz - 456.676 THz = 0.0102 THz = 10.2 GHz<br>
Thus, if hydrogen atoms are subjected to 10.2 GHz electromagnetic energy (i.e., energy<br>
corresponding to microwaves), then the 456 THz electronic, spectrum frequency is energized<br>
by resonating with it indirectly. In other words, the 10.2 GHz, will add to 456.676 THz to<br>
produce the resonant frequency of 456.686 THz. The 10.2 GHz will also subtract from the<br>
456.686 THz to produce the resonant frequency of 456.676 THz. Thus, by introducing 10.2<br>
GHz to a hydrogen atom, the hydrogen atom is excited at the 456 THz frequency. A<br>
microwave frequency can be used to stimulate an electronic level.<br>
According to the present invention, it is also possible to use a combination of<br>
mimicked catalyst mechanisms. For example, it is possible to: 1) resonate with the hydrogen<br>
atom frequencies indirectly through heterodynes (i.e., fine splitting frequencies); and/or 2)<br>
resonate with the hydrogen atom at multiple frequencies. Such multiple resonating could<br>
occur using a combination of microwave frequencies either simultaneously, in sequence,<br>
and/or in chirps or bursts. For example, the individual microwave fine splitting frequencies<br>
for hydrogen of 10.87 GHz, 10.2 GHz, 3.23 GHz, 1.38 GHz, and 1.06 GHz could be used in<br>
a sequence. Further, there are many fine splitting frequencies for hydrogen that have not<br>
been expressly included herein, thus, depending on the frequency range of equipment<br>
available, the present invention provides a means for tailoring the chosen frequencies to the<br>
capabilities of the available equipment. Thus, the flexibility according to the teachings of the<br>
present invention is enormous.<br>
Another method to deliver multiple electromagnetic; energy frequencies according to<br>
the present invention, is to use a lower frequency as a carrier wave for a higher frequency.<br>
This can be done, for example, by producing 10.2 GHz EM energy in short bursts, with the<br>
bursts coming at a rate of about 239 MHz. Both of these frequencies are fine splitting<br>
frequencies for hydrogen. This can also be achieved by continuously delivering EM energy<br>
and by varying the amplitude at a rate of about 239 MHz. These techniques can be used<br>
alone or in combination with the various other techniques disclosed herein.<br>
Thus, by mimicking one or more mechanisms of action of catalysts and by making<br>
use of the atomic fine structure and splitting frequencies, it is possible to energize upper<br>
levels of atoms using microwave and radiowave frequencies. Accordingly, by selectively<br>
energizing or targeting particular atoms, it is possible to catalyze and guide desirable<br>
reactions to desired end products. Depending on the circumstances, the option to use lower<br>
frequencies may have many advantages. Lower frequencies typically have much better<br><br>
penetration into large reaction spaces and volumes, and may be better suited to large-scale<br>
industrial applications. Lower frequencies may be easier to deliver with portable, compact<br>
equipment, as opposed to large, bulky equipment which delivers higher frequencies (e.g.,<br>
lasers). The choice of frequencies of a spectral catalyst may be for as simple a reason as to<br>
avoid interference from other sources of EM energy. Thus, according to the present<br>
invention, an understanding of the basic processes of heterodyning and fine structure splitting<br>
frequencies confers greater flexibility in designing and applying spectral energy catalysts in a<br>
targeted manner. Specifically, rather than simply reproducing the spectral pattern of a<br>
physical catalyst, the present invention teaches that is possible to make full use of the entire<br>
range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum, so long as the teachings of the present<br>
invention are followed. Thus, certain desirable frequencies can be applied while other not so<br>
desirable frequencies could be left out of an applied spectral energy catalyst targeted to a<br>
particular participant and/or component in the reaction system.<br>
As a further example, reference is again made to the hydrogen and oxygen reaction<br>
for the formation of water. If it is desired to catalyze the water reaction by duplicating the<br>
catalyst's mechanism of action in the microwave region, the present invention teaches that<br>
several options are available. Another such option is use of the knowledge that platinum<br>
energizes the reaction intermediates of the hydroxy radical. In addition to the hydrogen atom,<br>
the B frequency for the hydroxy radical is 565.8 GHz. That means that the actual<br>
heterodyned difference between the rotational frequencies is 2B, or 1,131.6 GHz.<br>
Accordingly, such a frequency could be utilized to achieve excitement of the hydroxy radical<br>
intermediate.<br>
Further, the a constant for the hydroxy radical is 21.4 GHz. Accordingly, this<br>
frequency could also be applied to energizing the hydroxy radical. Thus, by introducing<br>
hydrogen and oxygen gases into a chamber and irradiating the gases with 21.4 GHz, water<br>
will be formed. This particular gigahertz energy is a harmonic heterodyne of the rotational<br>
frequencies for the same rotational level but different vibrational levels. The heterodyned<br>
frequency energizes all the rotational frequencies, which energize the vibrational levels,<br>
which energize the electronic frequencies, which catalyze the reaction. Accordingly, the<br>
aforementioned reaction could be catalyzed or targeted with a spectral catalyst applied at<br>
several applicable frequencies, all of which match with one or more frequencies in one or<br>
more participants and thus permit energy to transfer.<br>
Still further, delivery of frequencies of 565.8 GHz, or even L131.6 GHz, would result<br>
in substantially all of the rotational levels in the molecule becoming energized, from the<br>
ground state all the way up. This approach copies a catalyst mechanism of action in two<br>
ways. The first way is by energizing the hydroxy radical and sustaining a crucial reaction<br>
intermediate to catalyze the formation of water. The second mechanism copied from the<br>
catalyst is to energize multiple levels in the molecule. Because the rotational constant "B"<br>
relates to the rotational frequencies, heterodynes occur at all levels in the molecule. Thus,<br>
using the frequency "B" energizes all levels in the molecule. This potentiates the<br>
establishment of an energy amplification system such as that which occurs with the physical<br>
catalyst platinum.<br>
Still further, if a molecule was energized with a frequency corresponding to an Z-type<br>
doubling constant, such frequency could be used in a substantially similar manner in which a<br>
fine splitting frequency from an atomic spectrum is used. The difference between the two<br>
frequencies in a doublet is a heterodyne, and energizing the doublet with its' heterodyne<br>
frequency (i.e., the splitting frequency) would energize the basic frequency and catalyze the<br>
reaction.<br>
A still further example utilizes a combination of frequencies for atomic fine structure.<br>
For instance, by utilizing a constant central frequency of 1,131.6 GHz (i.e., the heterodyned<br>
difference between rotational frequencies for a hydroxy radical) with a vibrato varying<br>
around the central frequency by ± 21.4 GHz (i.e., the a constant harmonic for variations<br>
between rotational frequencies), use could be made of 1.131.6 GHz EM energy in short<br>
bursts, with the bursts coming at a rate of 21.4 GHz.<br>
Since there is slight variation between rotational frequencies for the same level, that<br>
frequency range can be used to construct bursts. For example, if the largest "B" is 565.8<br>
GHz, then a rotational frequency heterodyne corresponds to 1,131.6 GHz. If the smallest "B"<br>
is 551.2 GHz, this corresponds to a rotational frequency heterodyne of 1,102 GHz. Thus,<br>
"chirps" or bursts of energy starting at 1,100 GHz and increasing in frequency to 1,140 GHz,<br>
could be used. In fact, the transmitter could be set to "chirp" or burst at a rate of 21.4 GHz.<br>
In any event, there are many ways to make use of the atomic and molecular fine<br>
structure frequencies, with their attendant heterodynes and harmonics. An understanding of<br>
catalyst mechanisms of action enables one of ordinary skill armed with the teachings of the<br>
present invention to utilize a spectral catalyst from the high frequency ultraviolet and visible<br>
light regions, down into the sometimes more manageable microwave and radiowave regions.<br>
Moreover, the invention enables an artisan of ordinary skill to calculate and/or determine the<br>
effects of microwave and radiowave energies on chemical reactions and/or reaction<br>
pathways.<br>
HYPERFINE FREQUENCIES<br>
Hyperfine structure frequencies are similar to the fine structure frequencies. Fine<br>
structure frequencies can be seen by magnifying a portion of a standard frequency spectrum.<br>
Hyperfine frequencies can be seen by magnifying a portion of a fine structure spectrum. Fine<br>
}<br>
structure splitting frequencies occur at lower frequencies than the electronic spectra,<br>
primarily in the infrared and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Hypeifine<br>
splitting frequencies occur at even lower frequencies than the fine structure spectra, primarily<br>
in the microwave and radio wave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Fine structure<br>
frequencies are generally caused by at least the electron interacting with its' own magnetic<br>
field. Hyperfine frequencies are generally caused by at least the electron interacting with the<br>
magnetic field of the nucleus.<br>
Figure 36 shows the rotation-vibration band frequency spectra for an SF6 molecule.<br>
The rotation-vibration band and fine structure are shown again in Figure 45. However, the<br>
fine structure frequencies are seen by magnifying a small section of the standard vibrational<br>
band spectrum (i.e., the lower portion of Figure 45 shows some of the fine structure<br>
frequencies). In many respects, looking at fine structure frequencies is like using a<br>
magnifying glass to look at a standard spectrum. Magnification of what looks like a flat and<br>
uninteresting portion of a standard vibrational frequency band shows many more curves with<br>
lower frequency splitting. These many other curves are the fine structure curves. Similarly,<br>
by magnifying a small and seemingly uninteresting portion of the fine structure spectrum of<br>
the result is yet another spectrum of many more curves known as the hyperfine spectrum.<br>
A small portion (i.e., from zero to 300) of the SF6 fine structure spectrum is magnified<br>
in Figure 46. The hyperfine spectrum includes many curves split part by even lower<br>
frequencies. This time the fine structure spectrum was magnified instead of the regular<br>
vibrational spectrum. What is found is even more curves, even closer together. Figures 47a<br>
and 47b show a further magnification of the two curves marked with asterisks (i.e., "*" and<br>
"**") in Figure 46.<br>
What appears to be a single crisp curve in Figure 46, turns out to be a series of several<br>
curves spaced very close together. These are the hyperfine frequency curves. Accordingly,<br>
the fine structure spectra is comprised of several more curves spaced very close together.<br>
These other curves spaced even closer together correspond to the hyperfine frequencies.<br>
Figures 47a and 47b show that the spacing of the hyperfine frequency curves are very<br>
close together and at somewhat regular intervals. The small amount that the hyperfine curves<br>
are split apart is called the hyperfine splitting frequency. The hyperfine splitting frequency is<br>
also a heterodyne. This concept is substantially similar to the concept of the fine splitting<br>
frequency. The difference between two curves that are split apart is called a splitting<br>
frequency. As before, the difference between two curves is referred to as a heterodyne-<br>
frequency. So, hyperfine splitting frequencies are all heterodynes of hyperfine frequencies.<br>
Because the hyperfine frequency curves result from a magnification of the fine<br>
structure curves, the hyperfine splitting frequencies occur at only a fraction of the fine<br>
structure splitting frequencies. The fine structure splitting frequencies are really just several<br>
curves, spaced very close together around the regular spectrum frequency. Magnification of<br>
fine structure splitting frequencies results in hyperfine splitting frequencies. The hyperfine<br>
splitting frequencies are really just several more curves, spaced very close together. The<br>
closer together the curves are, the smaller the distance or frequency separating them. Now<br>
the distance separating any two curves is a heterodyne frequency. So, the closer together any<br>
two curves are, the smaller (lower) is the heterodyne frequency between them. The distance<br>
between hyperfine splitting frequencies<br>
(i.e., the amount that hyperfine frequencies are split apart) is the hypeifine splitting<br>
frequency. It can also be called a constant or interval.<br>
The electronic spectrum frequency of hydrogen is 2,466 THz. The 2,466 THz<br>
frequency is made up of fine structure curves spaced 10.87 GHz (0.01087 THz) apart. Thus,<br>
the fine splitting frequency is 10.87 GHz. Now the fine stracture curves are made up of<br>
hyperfine curves. These hyperfine curves are spaced just 23.68 and 59.21 MHz apart. Thus,<br>
23 and 59 MHz are both hyperfine splitting frequencies for hydrogen. Other hyperfine<br>
splitting frequencies for hydrogen include 2.71, 4.21, 7.02, 17.55, 52.63, 177.64, and 1,420.0<br>
MHz. The hyperfine splitting frequencies are spaced even closer together than the fine<br>
structure splitting frequencies, so the hyperfine splitting frequencies are smaller and lower<br>
than the fine splitting frequencies.<br>
Thus, the hyperfine splitting frequencies are lower than the fine splitting frequencies.<br>
This means that rather than being in the infrared and microwave regions, as the fine splitting<br>
frequencies can be, the hyperfine splitting frequencies are ir. the microwave and radiowave<br>
regions. These lower frequencies are in the MHz (106 hertz) and Khz (103 hertz) regions of<br>
the electromagnetic spectrum. Several of the hyperfine splitting frequencies for hydrogen are<br>
shown in Figure 4S. (Figure 48 shows hyperfine structure in the n = 2 to n = 3 transition of ¦<br>
hydrogen).<br>
Figure 49 shows the hyperfine frequencies for CH3I. These frequencies are a<br>
magnification of the fine structure frequencies for that molecule. Since fine structure<br>
frequencies for molecules are actually rotational frequencies, what is shown is actually the<br>
hyperfine splitting of rotational frequencies. Figure 49 shows the hyperfine splitting of just<br>
the J = 1? 2 rotational transition. The splitting between the two tallest curves is less than<br>
100 MHz.<br>
Figure 50 shows another example of the molecule ClCN. This set of hyperfine<br>
frequencies is from the J = 1 ? 2 transition of the ground vibrational state for ClCN. Notice<br>
that the hyperfine frequencies are separated by just a few megahertz, (MHz) and in a few<br>
places by less than even one megahertz.<br>
The energy-level diagram and spectrum of the J = ½ ? 3/2 rotational transition for<br>
NO is shown if Figure 51.<br>
In Figure 52, the hyperfine splitting frequencies for NH3 are shown. Notice that the<br>
frequencies are spaced so close together that the scale at the bottom is in kilohertz (Kc/sec).<br>
The hyperfine features of the lines were obtained using a beam spectrometer.<br>
Just as with fine splitting frequencies, the hyperfine splitting frequencies are<br>
heterodynes of atomic and molecular frequencies. Accordingly, if an atom or molecule is<br>
stimulated with a frequency equal to a hyperfine splitting frequency (a heterodyned<br>
difference between hyperfine frequencies), the present invention teaches that the energy will<br>
equal to a hyperfine splitting frequency will resonate with the hyperfine frequencies<br>
indirectly through heterodynes. The related rotational, vibrational, and/or electronic energy<br>
levels will, in turn, be stimulated. This is an important discovery. It allows one to use more<br>
radio and microwave frequencies to selectively stimulate and target specific holoreaction<br>
system components (e.g., atomic hydrogen intermediates can be stimulated with, for example.<br>
(2.55, 23.68 59.2 and/or 1,420 MHz).<br>
Hyperfine frequencies, like fine frequencies, also contain features such as doublets.<br>
Specifically, in a region where one would expect to find only a single hyperfine frequency<br>
curve, there are two curves instead, typically, one on either side of the location where a single<br>
hyperfine frequency was expected. Hyperfine doubling is shown in Figures 53 and 54. This<br>
hyperfine spectrum is also from NH3. Figure 53 corresponds to the J = 3 rotational level and<br>
Figure 54 corresponds to the J = 4 rotational level. The doubling can be seen most easily in<br>
the J = 3 curves (i.e., Figure 53). There are two sets of short curves, a tall one, and then two<br>
more short sets. Each of the short sets of curves is generally located where one would expect<br>
to find just one curve. There are two curves instead, one on either side of the main curve<br>
location. Each set of curves is a hyperfine doublet.<br>
There are different notations to indicate the source of the doubling such as l-type<br>
doubling, K doubling, and A doubling, etc., and they all have their own constants or intervals.<br>
Without going into the detailed theory behind the formation of various types of doublets, the<br>
interval between any two hyperfine multiplet curves is also a heterodyne, and thus all of these<br>
doubling constants represent frequency heterodynes. Accordingly, those frequency<br>
heterodynes (i.e., hyperfine constants) can also be used as spectral energy catalysts according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
Specifically, a frequency in an atom or molecule can be stimulated directly or<br>
indirectly. If the goal was to stimulate the 2,466 THz frequency of hydrogen for some<br>
reason, then, for example, an ultraviolet laser could irradiate the hydrogen with 2,466 THz<br>
electromagnetic radiation. This would stimulate the atom directly. However, if such a laser<br>
was unavailable, then hydrogen's fine structure splitting frequency of 10.87 GHz could be<br>
achieved with microwave equipment. The gigahertz frequency would heterodyne (i.e., add or<br>
subtract) with the two closely spaced fine structure curves at 2,466, and stimulate the 2,466<br>
THz frequency band. This would stimulate the atom indirectly.<br>
Still further, the atom could be stimulated by using the hyperfine splitting frequency<br>
for hydrogen at 23.68 MHz as produced by radiowave equipment. The 23.68 MHz frequency<br>
would heterodyne (i.e., add or subtract) with the two closely spaced hyperfine frequency<br>
curves at 2,466, and stimulate the fine structure curves at the 2,466 THz. Stimulation of the<br>
fine structure curves would in turn lead to stimulation of the 2,466 THz electronic frequency<br>
for the hydrogen atom.<br>
Still further, additional hyperfine splitting frequencies for hydrogen in the radio wave<br>
and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum could also be used to stimulate the<br>
atom. For example, a radio wave pattern with 2.7 MHz, 4.2 MHz, 7 MHz, 18 MHz, 23 MHz,<br>
52 MHz, and 59 MHz could be used. This would stimulate several different hyperfine<br>
frequencies of hydrogen, and it would stimulate them essentially all at the same time. This<br>
would cause stimulation of the fine structure frequencies, which in turn would stimulate the<br>
electronic frequencies in the hydrogen atom.<br>
Still further, depending on available equipment and/or design, and/or processing<br>
constraints, some delivery mode variations can also be used. For example, one of the lower<br>
frequencies could be a carrier frequency for the upper frequencies. A continuous frequency<br>
of 52 MHz could be varied in amplitude at a rate of 2.7 MHz. Or, a 59 MHz frequency could<br>
be pulsed at a rate of 4.2 MHz. There are various ways in v/hich these frequencies can be<br>
combined and/or delivered, including different wave shapes durations, intensity shapes, duty<br>
cycles, etc. Depending on which of the hyperfine splitting frequencies are stimulated, the<br>
evolution of, for example, various and specific transients may be precisely tailored and<br>
controlled, allowing precise control over holoreaction systems using the fine and/or hyperfine<br>
splitting frequencies.<br>
Accordingly, a major point of the present invention is once it is understood the energy<br>
transfers when frequencies match, then determining which frequencies are available for<br>
matching is the next step. This invention discloses precisely how to achieve that goal.<br>
Interactions between equipment limitations, processing constraints, etc., can decide which<br>
frequencies are best suited for a particular purpose. Thus, both direct resonance and indirect<br>
resonance are suitable approaches for the use of spectral energy catalysts.<br>
ELECTRIC FIELDS<br>
Another means for modifying the spectral pattern of substances, is to expose a<br>
substance to an electric field. Specifically, in the presence of an electric field, spectral<br>
frequency lines of atoms and molecules can be split, shifted, broadened, or changed in<br>
intensity. The effect of an electric field on spectral lines is known as the "Stark Effect", in<br>
honor of its' discoverer, J. Stark. In 1913, Stark discovered that the Balmer series of<br>
hydrogen (i.e., curve II of Figures 9a and 9b) was split into several different components,<br>
while Stark was using a high electric field in the presence of a hydrogen flame. In the<br>
intervening years, Stark's original observation has evolved into a separate branch of<br>
spectroscopy, namely the study of the structure of atoms and molecules by measuring the<br>
changes in their respective spectral lines caused by an electric field.<br>
The electric field effects have some similarities to fine and hyperfine splitting<br>
frequencies. Specifically, as previously discussed herein, fine structure and hyperfine<br>
structure frequencies, along with their low frequency splitting or coupling constants, were<br>
caused by interactions inside the atom or molecule, between the electric field of the electron<br>
and the magnetic field of the electron or nucleus. Electric field effects are similar, except that<br>
instead of the electric field coming from inside the atom, the electric field is applied from<br>
outside the atom. The Stark effect is primarily the interaction of an external electric field,<br>
from outside the atom or molecule, with the electric and magnetic fields already established<br>
within the atom or molecule.<br>
When examining electric field effects on atoms, molecules, ions and/or components<br>
thereof, the nature of the electric field should also be considered (e.g., such as whether the<br>
electric field is static or dynamic). A static electric field may be produced by a direct current.<br>
A dynamic electric field is time varying, and may be produced by an alternating current. If<br>
the electric field is from an alternating current, then the frequency of the alternating current<br>
compared to the frequencies of the, for instance atom or molecule, should also be considered.<br>
In atoms, an external electric field disturbs the charge distribution of the atom's<br>
electrons. This disturbance of the electron's own electric field induces a dipole moment in it<br>
(i.e., slightly lopsided charge distribution). This lopsided electron dipole moment then<br>
interacts with the external electric field. In other words, the external electric field first<br>
induces a dipole moment in the electron field, and then interacts with the dipole. The end<br>
result is that the atomic frequencies become split into several different frequencies. The<br>
amount the frequencies are split apart depends on the strength of the electric field. In other<br>
words, the stronger the electric field, the farther apart the splitting.<br>
If the splitting varies directly with the electric field strength, then it is called first<br>
order splitting (i.e., Av = AF where Av is the splitting frequency, A is a constant and F is the<br>
electric field strength. When the splitting varies with the square of the field strength, it is<br>
called a second order or quadriatic effect (i.e., Dv = BF2). One or both effects may be seen in<br>
various forms of matter. For example, the hydrogen atom exhibits first order Stark effects at<br>
low electric field strengths, and second order effects at high field strengths. Other electric<br>
field effects which vary with the cube or the fourth power, etc., of the electric field strength<br>
are less -studied, but produce splitting frequencies nonetheless. A second order electric field<br>
effect for potassium is shown in Figures 55 and 56. Figure 55 shows the schematic<br>
dependence of the 4s and 5p energy levels on the electric field. Figure 56 shows a plot of the<br>
deviation from zero-field positions of the 5p2 Pl/2.3/2 +- 4s2 Sl/2 transition wavenumbers<br>
against the square of the electric field. Note that the frequency splitting or separation of the<br>
frequencies (i.e., deviation from zero-field wavenumber) varies with the square of the electric<br>
field strength (v/cm)2.<br>
The mechanism for the Stark effect in molecules is simpler than the effect is in atoms.<br>
Most molecules already have an electric dipole moment (i.e., a slightly uneven charge<br>
distribution). The external electric field simply interacts with the electric dipole moment<br>
already inside the molecule. The type of interaction, a first or a second order Stark effect, is<br>
different for differently shaped molecules. For example, most symmetric top molecules have<br>
first-order Stark effects. Asymmetric rotors typically have second-order Stark effects. Thus,<br>
in molecules, as in atoms, the splitting or separation of the frequencies due to the external<br>
electric field, is proportional either to the electric field strength itself, or to the square of the<br>
electric field strength.<br>
An example of this is shown in Figure 57, which diagrams how frequency<br>
components of the J = 0? 1 rotational transition for the molecule CH3Cl respond to an<br>
external electric field. When the electric field is very small (e.g., less than 10 E2 esu2/cm2),<br>
the primary effect is shifting of the three rotational frequencies to higher frequencies. As the<br>
field strength is increased (e.g., between 10 and 20 E2 esu2/crn2), the three rotational<br>
frequencies split into five different frequencies. With continued increases in the electric field<br>
strength, the now five frequencies continue to shift to even higher frequencies. Some of the<br>
intervals or differences between the five frequencies remain the same regardless of the<br>
electric field strength, while other intervals become progressively larger and higher. Thus, a<br>
heterodyned frequency might stimulate splitting frequencies at one electric field strength, but<br>
not at another.<br>
Another molecular example is shown in Figure 58. (This is a diagram of the Stark<br>
Effect in the same OCS molecule shown in Figure 44 for the J = 1 ? 2). The J= 1 ? 2<br>
rotational transition frequency is shown centered at zero on the horizontal frequency axis in<br>
Figure 58. That frequency centered at zero is a single frequency when there is no external<br>
electric field. When an electric field is added, however, the single rotational frequency splits<br>
into two- The stronger the electric field is, the wider the splitting is between the two<br>
frequencies. One of the new frequencies shifts up higher and higher, while the other<br>
frequency shifts lower and lower. Because the difference between the two frequencies<br>
changes when the electric field strength changes, a heterodyned splitting frequency might<br>
stimulate the rotational level at one electric field strength, but not at another. An electric field<br>
can effect the spectral frequencies of reaction participants, and thus impact the spectral<br>
chemistry of a reaction.<br>
Broadening and shifting of spectral lines also occurs with the intermolecular Stark<br>
effect. The intermolecular Stark effect is produced when the electric field from surrounding<br>
atoms, ions, or molecules, affects the spectral emissions of the species under study. In other<br>
words, the external electric field comes from other atoms and molecules rather than from a<br>
DC or AC current. The other atoms and molecules are in constant motion, and thus their<br>
electric fields are inhomogeneous in space and time. Instead of a frequency being split into<br>
several easily seen narrow frequencies, the original frequency simply becomes much wider,<br>
encompassing most, if not all, of what would have been the split frequencies, (i.e., it is<br>
broadened). Solvents, support materials, poisons, promoters, etc., are composed of atoms and<br>
molecules and components thereof. It is now understood that many of their effects are the<br>
result of the intermolecular Stark effect.<br>
The above examples demonstrate how an electric field splits, shifts, and broadens<br>
spectral frequencies for matter. However, intensities of the lines can also be affected. Some<br>
of these variations in intensity are shown in Figures 59a and 59b. Figure 59a shows patterns<br>
of Stark components for transitions in the rotation of an asymmetric top molecule for the J =<br>
4 ? 5 transition; whereas Figure 59b corresponds to J = 4 ? 4. The intensity variations<br>
depend on rotational transitions, molecular structure, etc., and the electric field strength.<br>
An interesting Stark effect is shown in a structure such as a molecule, which has<br>
hyperfine (rotational) frequencies. The general rule for the creation of hyperfine frequencies<br>
is that the hyperfine frequencies result from an interaction between electrons and the nucleus.<br>
This interaction can be affected by an external electric field. If the applied external electric<br>
field is weak, then the Stark energy is much less than the energy of the hyperfine. energy (i.e.,<br>
rotational energy). The hyperfine lines are split into various new lines, and the separation<br>
(i.e., splitting) between the lines is very small (i.e., at radio frequencies and extra low<br>
frequencies).<br>
If the external electric field is very strong, then the Stark energy is much larger than<br>
the hyperfine energy, and the molecule is tossed, sometimes violently, back and forth by the<br>
electric field. In this case, the hyperfine structure is radically changed. It is almost as though<br>
there no longer is any hyperfine structure. The Stark splitting is substantially the same as that<br>
which would have been observed if there were no hyperfine frequencies, and the hyperfine<br>
frequencies simply act as a small perturbation to the Stark splitting frequencies.<br>
If the external electric field is intermediate in strength, then the Stark and hyperfine<br>
energies are substantially equivalent. In this case, the calculations become very complex.<br>
Generally, the Stark splitting is close to the same frequencies as the hyperfine splitting, but<br>
the relative intensities of the various components can vary rapidly with slight changes in the<br>
strength of the external electric field. Thus, at one electric field strength one splitting<br>
frequency may predominate, while at an electric field strength just 1% higher, a totally<br>
different Stark frequency could predominate in intensity.<br>
All of the preceding discussion on the Stark effect has concentrated on the effects due<br>
to a static electric field, such as one would find with a direct current. The Stark effects of a<br>
dynamic, or time-varying electric field produced by an alternating current, are quite<br>
interesting and can be quite different. Just which of those affects appear, depends on the<br>
frequency of the electric field (i.e., alternating current) compared to the frequency of the<br>
matter in question. If the electric field is varying very slowly, such as with 60 Hz wall outlet<br>
electricity, then the normal or static type of electric field effect occurs. As the electric field<br>
varies from zero to maximum field strength, the matter frequencies vary from their unsplit<br>
frequencies to their maximally split frequencies at the rate of the changing electric field.<br>
Thus, the electric field frequency modulates the frequency of the splitting phenomena.<br>
However, as the electrical frequency increases, the first frequency measurement it will<br>
begin to overtake is the line width (see Figure 16 for a diagram of line width). The line width<br>
of a curve is its' distance across, and the measurement is actually a very tiny heterodyne<br>
frequency measurement from one side of the curve to the othsr side. Line width frequencies<br>
are typically around 100 KHz at room temperature. In practical terms, line width represents a<br>
relaxation time for molecules, where the relaxation time is the time required for any transient<br>
phenomena to disappear. So, if the electrical frequency is significantly smaller than the line<br>
width frequency, the molecule has plenty of time to adjust to the slowly changing electric<br>
field, and the normal or static-type Stark effects occur.<br>
If the electrical frequency is slightly less than the line width frequency, the molecule<br>
changes its' frequencies substantially in rhythm with the frequency of the electric field (i.e., it<br>
entrains "to the frequency of the electric field). This is shown in Figure 60 which shows the<br>
Stark effect for OCS on the J = 1 ? 2 transition with applied electric fields at various<br>
frequencies. The letter "a" corresponds to the Stark effect with a static DC electric field; "b"<br>
corresponds to a broadening and blurring of the Stark frequencies with a 1 KHz electric field;<br>
and "c" corresponds to a normal Stark effect with an electric field of 1,200 KHz. As the<br>
electric field frequency approaches the KHz line width range, the Stark curves vary their<br>
frequencies with the electric field frequency and become broadened and somewhat blurred.<br>
When the electric field frequency moves up and beyond the line width range to about 1,200<br>
KHz, the normal Stark type curves again become crisp and distinguishable. In many<br>
respects, the molecule cannot keep up with the rapid electrical field variation and simply<br>
averages the Stark effect. In all three cases, the cyclic splitting of the Stark frequencies is<br>
modulated with the electrical field frequency, or its' first harmonic (i.e., 2X the electrical<br>
field frequency).<br>
The next frequency measurement that an ever-increasing electrical frequency will<br>
overtake in a molecule is the transitional frequency between two rotational levels (i.e.,<br>
hyperfine frequencies). As the electric field frequency approaches a transitional frequency<br>
between two levels, the radiation of the transitional frequency in the molecule will induce<br>
transitions back and forth between the levels. The molecule oscillates back and forth<br>
between both levels, at the frequency of the electric field. When the electric field and<br>
transition level frequencies are substantially the same (i.e., in resonance), the molecule will<br>
be oscillating back and forth in both levels, and the spectral lines for both levels will appear<br>
simultaneously and at approximately the same intensity. Normally, only one frequency level<br>
is seen at a time, but a resonant electric field causes the molecule to be at both levels at<br>
essentially the same time, and so both transitional frequencies appear in its' spectrum.<br>
Moreover, for sufficiently large electric fields (e.g., those used to generate plasmas)<br>
additional transition level frequencies can occur at regular spacings substantially equal to the<br>
electric field frequency. Also, splitting of the transition level frequencies can occur, at<br>
frequencies of the electric field frequency divided by odd numbers (e.g., electric field<br>
frequency "fs" divided by 3, or 5, or 7, i.e., fE/3 or fE/5, etc.).<br>
All the varied effects of electric fields cause new frequencies, new splitting<br>
frequencies and new energy level states.<br>
Further, when the electric field frequency equals a transition level frequency of for<br>
instance, an atom or molecule, a second component with an opposite frequency charge and<br>
equal intensity can develop. This is negative Stark effect, with the two components of equal<br>
and opposite frequency charges destructively canceling each other. In spectral chemistry<br>
terms this amounts to a negative catalyst or poison in the holoreaction system, if the transition<br>
thus targeted was important to the reaction pathway. Thus, electric fields cause the Stark<br>
effect, which is the splitting, shifting, broadening, or changing intensity and changing<br>
transitional states of spectral frequencies for matter, (e.g., atoms and molecules). As with<br>
many of the other mechanisms that have been discussed herein, changes in the spectral<br>
frequencies of holoreaction systems can affect the reaction rate and/or reaction pathway. For<br>
example, consider a holoreaction system like the following:<br><br>
where A&amp;B are reactants, C is a physical catalyst, I stands for the intermediates, and D&amp;F<br>
are the products.<br>
Assume arguendo that the reaction normally progresses at only a moderate rate, by<br>
virtue of the fact that the physical catalyst produces several frequencies that are merely close<br>
to harmonics of the intermediates. Further assume that when an electric field is added, the<br>
catalyst frequencies are shifted so that several of the catalyst frequencies are now exact or<br>
substantially exact harmonics of the intermediates. This will result in, for example, the<br>
reaction being catalyzed at a faster rate. Thus, the Stark effect can be used to obtain a more<br>
efficient energy transfer through the matching of frequencies (i.e., when frequencies match,<br>
energies transfer).<br>
If a reaction normally progresses at only a moderate rate, many "solutions" have<br>
included subjecting the reaction system to extremely high pressures. The high pressures<br>
result in a broadening of the spectral patterns, which improves the transfer of energy through<br>
a matching of resonant frequencies. By understanding the underlying catalyst mechanisms of<br>
action, high-pressure systems could be replaced with, for example, a simple electric field<br>
which produces broadening. Not only would this be less costly to an industrial manufacturer,<br>
it could be much safer for manufacturing due to the removal of, for example, high-pressure<br>
equipment.<br>
Some reactants when mixed together do not react very quickly at all but when an<br>
electric field is added they react rather rapidly. The prior art may refer to such a reaction as<br>
being catalyzed by an electric field and the equations would look like this:<br><br>
where E is the electric field. In this case, rather than applying a catalyst "C" (as discussed<br>
previously) to obtain the products "D + F", an electric: field "E" can be applied. In this<br>
instance, the electric field works by changing the spectral frequencies (or spectral pattern) of<br>
one or more components in the reaction system so that the frequencies come into resonance,<br>
and the reaction can proceed along a desired reaction pathway (i.e., when frequencies match,<br>
energy is transferred). Understood in this way, the electric field becomes just another tool to<br>
change spectral frequencies of atoms and molecules, and thereby affect reaction rates in<br>
spectral chemistry.<br>
Reaction pathways are also important. In the absence of an electrical field, a reaction<br>
pathway will progress to one set of products:<br><br>
However, if an electrical field is added, at some particular strength of the field, the<br>
spectral frequencies may change so much, that a different intermediate is energized and the<br>
reaction proceeds down a different reaction pathway:<br><br>
This is similar to the concept discussed earlier herein, regarding the formation of different<br>
products depending on temperature. The changes in temperature caused changes in spectral<br>
frequencies, and hence different reaction pathways were favored at different temperatures.<br>
Likewise, electric fields cause changes in spectral frequencies, and hence different reactions<br>
pathways are favored by different electric fields. By tailoring an electric field to a particular<br>
holoraaction system, one can control not only the raie of the reaction but also the reaction<br>
products produced.<br>
The ability to tailor reactions, with or without a physical catalyst, by varying the<br>
strength of an electric field should be useful in many manufacturing situations. For example,<br>
it might be more cost effective to build only one physical set-up for a reaction system and to<br>
use one or more electric fields to change the reaction dynamics and products, depending on<br>
which product is desired. This would save the expense of having a separate physical set-up<br>
for production of each group of products.<br>
Besides varying the strength of an electric field, the frequency of an electric field can<br>
also be varied. Assuming that a reaction will proceed at a much faster rate if a particular<br>
strength static electric field (i.e., direct current) is added as in the following:<br><br>
But further assume, that because of reactor design and location, it is much easier to<br>
deliver a time-varying electric field with alternating current. A very low frequency field,<br>
such as with a 60 Hz wall outlet, can produce the normal or static-type Stark effect. Thus, the<br>
reactor could be adapted to the 60 Hz electric field and enjoy the same increase in reaction<br>
rate that would occur with the static electric field.<br>
If a certain physical catalyst produces spectral frequencies that are close to<br>
intermediate frequencies, but are not exact, it is possible that the activity of the physical<br>
catalyst in the past may have been improved by using higher temperatures. As disclosed<br>
earlier herein, the higher temperatures actually broadened the physical catalyst's spectral<br>
pattern to cause the frequency of the physical catalyst to be at least a partial match for at least<br>
one of the intermediates. What is significant here is that high temperature boilers can be<br>
minimized, or eliminated altogether, and in their stead a moderate frequency electric field<br>
which, for example, broadened the spectral frequencies, could be used. For example, a<br>
frequency of around 100 Khz, equivalent to the typical line width frequencies at room<br>
temperature, could broaden substantially all of the spectral curves and cause the physical<br>
catalyst's spectral curves to match those of, for example, required intermediates. Thus, the<br>
electric field could cause the matter to behave as though the temperature had been raised,<br>
even though it had not been. (Similarly, any spectral manipulation, (e.g., electric fields<br>
acoustics, heterodynes, etc., that cause changes in the spectral line width, may cause a<br>
material to behave as though its temperature had been changed).<br>
The cyclic splitting of the Stark frequencies can be modulated with the electrical field<br>
frequency or its' first harmonic (i.e., first-order Stark effects are modulated with the electrical<br>
field frequency, while second-order Stark effects are modulated by two times the electrical<br>
field, frequency). Assume that a metallic platinum catalyst is used in a hydrogen reaction and<br>
it is desired to stimulate the 2.7 MHz hyperfine frequency of the hydrogen atoms. Earlier<br>
herein it was disclosed that electromagnetic radiation could be used to deliver the 2.7 MHz<br>
frequency. However, use of an alternating electric field at 2.7 MHz could be used instead.<br>
Since platinum is a metal and conducts electricity well, the platinum can be considered to be<br>
a part of the alternating current circuit. The platinum will exhibit a Stark effect, with all the<br>
frequencies splitting at a rate of 2.7 MHz. At sufficiently strong electric fields, additional<br>
transition frequencies or "sidebands" will occur at regular spacings equal to the electric field<br>
frequency. There will be dozens of split frequencies in the platinum atoms that are<br>
heterodynes of 2.7 MHz. This massive heterodyned output may stimulate the hydrogen<br>
hyperfine frequency of 2.7 MHz and direct the reaction.<br>
Another way to achieve this reaction, of course, would be to leave the platinum out of<br>
the reaction altogether. The 2.7 MHz field will have a resonant Stark effect on the hydrogen,<br>
separate and independent of the platinum catalyst. Copper is not normally catalytic for<br>
hydrogen, but copper could be used to construct a reaction vessel like a Stark waveguide to<br>
energize the hydrogen. A Stark waveguide is used to perform Stark spectroscopy. It is<br>
shown as Figures 61a and 61b. Specifically, Figure 61a shows the construction of the Stark<br>
waveguide, whereas Figure 61b shows the distribution of fields in the Stark waveguide. The<br>
electrical field is delivered through the conducting plate. A reaction vessel could be made for<br>
the flow-through of gases and use an economical metal such as copper for the conducting<br>
plate. When the 2.7 MHz alternating current is delivered through the electrical connection to<br>
the copper conductor plate, the copper spectral frequencies, none of which are particularly<br>
resonant with hydrogen, will exhibit a Stark effect with normal-type splitting. The Stark<br>
frequencies will be split at a rate of 2.7 MHz. At a sufficiently strong electric field strength,<br>
additional sidebands will appear in the copper, with regular spacings (i.e., heterodynes) of 2.7<br>
MHz even though none of the actual copper frequencies matches the hydrogen frequencies,<br>
the Stark splitting or heterodynes will match the hydrogen frequency. Dozens of the copper<br>
split frequencies may resonate indirectly with the hydrogen hyperfine frequency and direct<br>
the reaction (i.e., when frequencies match, energies transfer).<br>
With sophisticated equipment and a good understanding of a particular system, Stark<br>
resonance can be used with a transition level frequency. For example, assume that to achieve<br>
a particular reaction pathway, a molecule needs to be stimulated with a transition level<br>
frequency of 500 MHz. By delivering the 500 MHz electrical field to the molecule, this<br>
resonant electrical field may cause the molecule to oscillate back and forth between the two<br>
levels at the rate of 500 MHz. This electrically creates the conditions for light amplification<br>
(i.e., laser via stimulation of multiple upper energy levels) and any added electromagnetic<br>
radiation at this frequency will be amplified by the molecule. In this manner, an electrical<br>
field may substitute for the laser effects of physical catalysts.<br>
In summary, by understanding the underlying spectral mechanisms of chemical<br>
reactions, electric fields can be used as yet another tool to catalyze and modify those<br>
chemical reactions and/or reaction pathways by modifying the spectral characteristics, for<br>
example, at least one participant and/or one or more components in the holoreaction system.<br>
Thus, another tool for mimicking catalyst mechanisms of reactions can be utilized.<br>
MAGNETIC FIELDS<br>
In spectral terms, magnetic fields behave similar to electric fields in their effect.<br>
Specifically, the spectral frequency lines, for instance of atoms and molecules, can be split<br>
and shifted by a magnetic field. In this case, the external magnetic field from outside the<br>
atom or molecule, interacts with the electric and magnetic fields already inside the atom or<br>
molecule.<br>
This action of an external magnetic field on spectral lines is called the "Zeeman<br>
Effect", in honor of its' discoverer, Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman. In 1896, Zeeman<br>
discovered that the yellow flame spectroscopy "D" lines of sodium were broadened when the<br>
flame was held between strong magnetic poles. It was later discovered that the apparent,<br>
broadening of the sodium spectral lines was actually due to their splitting and shifting.<br>
Zeeman's original observation has evolved into a separate branch of spectroscopy, relating to<br>
the study of atoms and molecules by measuring the changes in their spectral lines caused by a<br>
magnetic field. This in turn has evolved into the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy<br>
and magnetic resonance imaging used in medicine, as well as the laser magnetic resonance<br>
and electron spin resonance spectroscopy used in physics and chemistry.<br>
The Zeeman effect for the famous "D" lines of sodium is shown in Figures 62a and<br>
62b. Figure 62a shows the Zeeman effect for sodium "D" lines; whereas Figure 62b shows<br>
the energy level diagram for the transitions in the Zeeman effect for the sodium "D" lines.<br>
The "D" lines are traditionally said to result from transition between the 3p2P and 3s2S<br>
electron orbitals. As is shown, each of the single spectral frequencies is split into two or<br>
more slightly different frequencies, which center around the original unsplit frequency.<br>
In the Zeeman effect, the amount that the spectral frequencies are split apart depends<br>
on the strength of the applied magnetic field. Figure 63 shows Zeeman splitting effects for<br>
the oxygen atom as a function of magnetic field. When there is no magnetic field, there are<br>
two single frequencies at zero and 4.8. When the magnetic field is at low strength (e.g., 0.2<br>
Tesla) there is just slight splitting and shifting of the original two frequencies. However, as<br>
the magnetic field is increased, the frequencies are split and shifted farther and farther apart.<br>
The degree of splitting and shifting in the Zeeman effect, depending on magnetic field<br>
strength, is shown in Figure 64 for the 3P state of silicon.<br>
As with the Stark effect generated from an external electric field, the Zeeman effect,<br>
generated from an external magnetic field, is slightly different depending on whether an atom<br>
or molecule is subjected to the magnetic field. The Zeeman effect on atoms can be divided<br>
into three different magnetic field strengths: weak; moderate; and strong. If the magnetic<br>
field strength is weak, the amount that the spectral frequencies will be shifted and split apart<br>
will be very small. The shifting away from the original spectral frequency will still stimulate<br>
the shifted frequencies. This is because they will be so close to the original spectral<br>
frequency that they will still be well within its resonance curve. As for the splitting, it is so<br>
small, that it is even less than the hyperfine splitting that normally occurs. This means that in<br>
a weak magnetic field, there will be only very slight splitting of spectral frequencies,<br>
translating into very low splitting frequencies in the lower regions of the radio spectrum and<br>
down into the very low frequency region. For example, the Zeeman splitting frequency for<br>
the hydrogen atom, which is caused by the earth's magnetic field, is around 30 KHz. Larger<br>
atoms have even lower frequencies in the lower kilohertz and even hertz regions of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
Without a magnetic field, an atom can be stimulated by using direct resonance with a<br>
spectral frequency or by using its fine or hyperfine splitting frequencies in the infrared<br>
through/microwave, or microwave through radio regions, respectively. By merely adding a<br>
very weak magnetic field, the atom can be stimulated with an even lower radio or very low<br>
frequency matching the Zeeman splitting frequency. Thus, by simply using a weak magnetic<br>
field, a spectral catalyst range can be extended even lower into the radio frequency range.<br>
The weak magnetic field from the Earth causes Zeeman splitting in atoms in the hertz and<br>
kilohertz ranges. This means that all atoms, including those in biological organisms, are<br>
sensitive to hertz and kilohertz EM frequencies, by virtue of being subjected to the Earth's<br>
magnetic field.<br>
At the other end of magnetic field strength, is the very strong magnetic field. In this<br>
case, the splitting apart and shifting of the spectral frequencies will be very wide. With this<br>
wide shifting of frequencies, the difference between the split frequencies will be much larger<br>
than the difference between the hyperfine splitting frequencies. This translates to Zeeman<br>
effect splitting frequencies at higher frequencies than the hyperfine splitting frequencies. This<br>
splitting occurs somewhere around the microwave region. Although the addition of a strong<br>
magnetic field does not extend the reach in the electromagnetic spectrum at one extreme or<br>
the other, as a weak magnetic field does, it still does provide an option of several more<br>
potential spectral catalyst frequencies that can be used in the microwave region.<br>
The moderate magnetic field strength case is more complicated. The shifting and<br>
splitting caused by the Zeeman effect from a moderate magnetic field will be approximately<br>
equal to the hyperfine splitting. Although not widely discussed in the prior art, it is possible<br>
to apply a moderate magnetic field to an atom, to produce Zeeman splitting which is<br>
substantially equivalent to its' hyperfine splitting. This presents interesting possibilities.<br>
Methods for guiding atoms in chemical reactions were disclosed earlier herein by stimulating<br>
atoms with hyperfine splitting frequencies. The Zeeman effect provides a way to achieve<br>
similar effects without introducing any spectral frequencies at all. For example, by<br>
introducing a moderate magnetic field, resonance may be set-up within the atom itself, that<br>
stimulates and/or energizes and/or stabilizes the atom.<br>
The moderate magnetic field causes low frequency Zeeman splitting that matches and<br>
hence energizes the low frequency hyperfine splitting frequency in the atom. However, the<br>
low hyperfine splitting frequencies actually correspond to the heterodyned difference<br>
between two vibrational or fine structure frequencies. When the hyperfine splitting frequency<br>
is stimulated, the two electronic frequencies will eventually be stimulated. This in turn<br>
causes the atom to be, for example, stimulated. Thus, the Zeeman effect permits a spectral<br>
energy catalyst stimulation of an atom by exposing that atom to a precise strength of a<br>
magnetic field, and the use of spectral EM frequencies is not required (i.e., so long as<br>
frequencies match, energies will transfer). The possibilities are quite interesting because an<br>
inert holoreaction system may suddenly spring to life upon the application of the proper<br>
moderate strength magnetic field.<br>
There is also a difference between the "normal" Zeeman effect and the "anomalous"<br>
Zeeman effect. With the "normal" Zeeman effect, a spectral frequency is split by a magnetic<br>
field into three frequencies, with expected even spacing between them (see Figure 65a which<br>
shows the "normal" Zeeman effects and Figure 65b which shows the "anomalous" Zeeman<br>
effects). One of the new split frequencies is above the original frequency, and the other new<br>
split frequency is below the original frequency. Both new frequencies are split the same<br>
distance away from the original frequency. Thus, the difference between the upper and<br>
original and the lower and original frequencies is about the same. This means that in terms of<br>
heterodyne differences, there are at most, two new heterodyned differences with the normal<br>
Zeeman effect. The first heterodyne or splitting difference is the difference between one of<br>
the new split frequencies and the original frequency. The other splitting difference is<br>
between the upper and lower new split frequencies. It is, of course, twice the frequency<br>
difference between either of the upper or lower frequencies and the original frequency.<br>
In many instances the Zeeman splitting produced by a magnetic field results in more<br>
than three frequencies, or in splitting that is spaced differently than expected. This is called<br>
the "anomalous" Zeeman effect (see Figures 65 and 66; wherein Figure 66 shows an<br>
anomalous Zeeman effect for zinc 3p ? 3s.<br>
If there are still just three frequencies, and the Zeeman effect is anomalous because<br>
the spacing is different than expected, the situation is similar to the normal effect. However,<br>
there are at most, two new splitting frequencies that can be used. If, however, the effect is<br>
anomalous because more than three frequencies are produced, then there will be a much more<br>
richly varied situation. Assume an easy case where there are four Zeeman splitting<br>
frequencies (see Figures 67a and Figure 67b). Figure 67a shows four Zeeman splitting<br>
frequencies and Figure 67b shows four new heterodyned differences.<br>
In this example of anomalous Zeeman splitting, there are a total of four frequencies,<br>
where once existed only one frequency. For simplicity's sake, the new Zeeman frequencies<br>
will be labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Frequencies 3 and 4 are also split apart by the same difference<br>
"w". Thus, "w" is a heterodyned splitting frequency. Frequencies 2 and 3 are also split apart<br>
by a different amount "x". So far there are two heterodyned splitting frequencies, as in the<br>
normal Zeeman effect.<br>
However, frequencies 1 and 3 are split apart by a third amount "y", where "y" is the<br>
sum of "w" and "x". And, frequencies 2 and 4 are also split apart by the same third amount<br>
"y". Finally, frequencies 1 and 4 are split even farther apart by an amount "z". Once again,<br>
"z" is a summation amount from adding "w + x + w". Thus, the result is four heterodyned<br>
frequencies: w, x, y, and z in the anomalous Zeeman effect.<br>
If there were six frequencies present from the anomalous Zeeman effect, there would<br>
be even more heterodyned differences. Thus, the anomalous Zeeman effect results in far<br>
greater flexibility in the choice of frequencies when compared to the normal Zeeman effect.<br>
In the normal Zeeman effect the original frequency is split into three evenly spaced<br>
frequencies, with a total of just two heterodyned frequencies. In the anomalous Zeeman<br>
effect the original frequency is split into four or more unevenly spaced frequencies, with at<br>
least four or more heterodyned frequencies.<br>
Similar Zeeman effects can occur in molecules. Molecules come in three basic<br>
varieties: ferromagnetic; paramagnetic; and diamagnetic. Ferromagnetic molecules are<br>
typical magnets. The materials typically hold a strong magnetic field and are composed of<br>
magnetic elements such as iron, cobalt, and nickel.<br>
Paramagnetic molecules hold only a weak magnetic field. If a paramagnetic material<br>
is put into an external magnetic field, the magnetic moment of the molecules of the material<br>
are lined up in the same direction as the external magnetic field. Now, the magnetic moment<br>
of the molecules is the direction in which the molecules own magnetic field is weighted.<br>
Specifically, the magnetic moment of a molecule will tip to whichever side of the molecule is<br>
more heavily weighted in terms of its own magnetic field. Thus, paramagnetic molecules<br>
will typically tip in the same direction as an externally applied magnetic field. Because<br>
paramagnetic materials line up with an external magnetic field, they are also weakly attracted<br>
to sources of magnetic fields.<br>
Common paramagnetic elements include oxygen, aluminum, sodium, magnesium,<br>
calcium and potassium. Stable molecules such as oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO) are also<br>
paramagnetic. Molecular oxygen makes up approximately 20% of our planet's atmosphere.<br>
Both molecules play important roles in biologic organisms. In addition, unstable molecules,<br>
more commonly known as free radicals, chemical reaction intermediates or plasmas, are also<br>
paramagnetic. Paramagnetic ions include hydrogen, manganese, chromium, iron, cobalt, and<br>
nickel. Many paramagnetic substances occur in biological organisms. For instance the blood<br>
flowing in our veins is an ionic solution containing red blood cells. The red blood cells<br>
contain hemoglobin, which in turn contains ionized iron. The hemoglobin, and hence the red<br>
blood cells, are paramagnetic. In addition, hydrogen ions can be found in a multitude of<br>
organic compounds and reactions. For instance, the hydrochloric acid in a stomach contains<br>
hydrogen ions. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy system of nearly all biological<br>
organisms, requires hydrogen and manganese ions to function properly. Thus, the very<br>
existence of life itself depends on paramagnetic materials.<br>
Diamagnetic molecules, on the other hand, are repelled by a magnetic field, and line<br>
up what little magnetic moments they have away from the direction of an external magnetic<br>
field. Diamagnetic substances do not typically hold a magnetic field. Examples of<br>
diamagnetic elements include hydrogen, helium, neon, argon, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus,<br>
chlorine, copper, zinc, silver, gold, lead, and mercury. Diamagnetic molecules include water,<br>
most gases, organic compounds, and salts such as sodium chloride. Salts are really just<br>
crystals of diamagnetic ions. Diamagnetic ions include lithium, sodium, potassium,<br>
rubidium, caesium, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, ammonium, and sulphate. Ionic<br>
crystals usually dissolve easily in water, and as such the ionic water solution is also<br>
diamagnetic. Biologic organisms are filled with diamagnetic materials, because they are<br>
carbon-based life forms. In addition, the blood flowing in our veins is an ionic solution<br>
containing blood cells. The ionic solution (i.e., blood plasma) is made of water molecules,<br>
sodium ions, potassium ions, chlorine ions, and organic protein compounds. Hence, our blood<br>
is a diamagnetic solution carrying paramagnetic blood cells.<br>
With regard to the Zeeman effect, first: consider the case of paramagnetic molecules.<br>
As with atoms, the effects can be categorized on the basis of magnetic field strength. If the<br>
external magnetic field applied to a paramagnetic molecule is weak, the Zeeman effect will<br>
produce splitting into equally spaced levels. In most cases, the amount of splitting will be<br>
directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, a "first-order" effect. A general<br>
rule of thumb is that a field of one (1) oersted (i.e., slightly larger than the earth's magnetic<br>
field) will produce Zeeman splittings of approximately 1.4 MHz in paramagnetic molecules.<br>
Weaker magnetic fields will produce narrower splittings, at lower frequencies. Stronger<br>
magnetic fields will produce wider splittings, at higher frequencies. In these first order<br>
Zeeman effects, there is usually only splitting, with no shifting of the original or center<br>
frequency, as was present with Zeeman effects on atoms.<br>
In many paramagnetic molecules there are also second-order effects where the<br>
Zeeman splitting is proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength. In these cases,<br>
the splitting is much smaller and of much lower frequencies. In addition to splitting, the<br>
original or center frequencies shift as they do in atoms, proportional to the magnetic field<br>
strength.<br>
Sometimes the direction of the magnetic field in relation to the orientation of the<br>
molecule makes a difference. For instance, p frequencies are associated with a magnetic field<br>
parallel to an exciting electromagnetic field, while o frequencies are found when it is<br>
perpendicular. Both n and a frequencies are present with a circularly polarized<br>
electromagnetic field. Typical Zeeman splitting patterns for a paramagnetic molecule in two<br>
different transitions are shown in Figure 68a and 68b. The p frequencies are seen when AM<br>
= 0, and are above the long horizontal line. The a frequencies are seen when AM = ± 1, and<br>
are below the long horizontal line. If a paramagnetic molecule was placed in a weak<br>
magnetic field, circularly polarized light would excite both sets of frequencies in the<br>
molecule. Thus, it is possible to control which set of frequencies are excited in a molecule by<br>
controlling its orientation with respect to the magnetic field.<br>
When the magnetic field strength is intermediate, the interaction between the<br>
paramagnetic molecule's magnetic moments and the externally applied magnetic field<br>
produces Zeeman effects equivalent to other frequencies and energies in the molecule. For<br>
instance, the Zeeman spitting may be near a rotational frequency and disturb the end-over-<br>
end rotational motion of the molecule. The Zeeman splitting and energy may be particular or<br>
large enough to uncouple the molecule's spin from its molecular axis.<br>
If the magnetic field is very strong, the nuclear magnetic moment spin will uncouple<br>
from the molecular angular momentum. In this case, the Zeeman effects overwhelm the<br>
hyperfine structure, and are of much higher energies at much higher frequencies. In spectra<br>
1 £TO<br>
of molecules exposed to strong magnetic fields, hyperfine splitting appears as a small<br>
perturbation of the Zeeman splitting.<br>
Next, consider Zeeman effects in so called "ordinary molecules" or diamagnetic<br>
molecules. Most molecules are of the diamagnetic variety, hence the designation "ordinary".<br>
This includes, of course, most organic molecules found in biologic organisms. Diamagnetic<br>
molecules have rotational magnetic moments from rotation of the positively charged nucleus,<br>
and this magnetic moment of the nucleus is only about 1/1000 of that from the paramagnetic<br>
molecules. This means that the energy from Zeeman splitting in diamagnetic molecules is<br>
much smaller than the energy from Zeeman splitting in paramagnetic molecules. The<br>
equation for the Zeeman energy in diamagnetic molecules is:<br><br>
where J is the molecular rotational angular momentum, I is the nuclear-spin angular<br>
momentum, gj is the rotational g factor, and g1 is the nuclear-spin g factor. This Zeeman<br>
energy is much less, and of much lower frequency, than the paramagnetic Zeeman energy. In<br>
terms of frequency, it falls in the hertz and kilohertz regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
Finally, consider the implications of Zeeman splitting for catalyst and chemical<br>
reactions and for spectral chemistry. A weak magnetic field will produce hertz and kilohertz<br>
Zeeman splitting in atoms and second order effects in paramagnetic molecules. Virtually any<br>
land of magnetic field will produce hertz and kilohertz Zeeman splitting in diamagnetic<br>
molecules. All these atoms and molecules will then become sensitive to radio and very low<br>
frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves. The atoms and molecules will absorb the radio or<br>
VLF energy and become stimulated to a greater or lesser degree. This could be used to add<br>
spectral energy to, for instance, a particular molecule or intermediate in a chemical<br>
holoreaction system. For instance, for hydrogen and oxygen gases turning into water over a<br>
platinum catalyst, the hydrogen atom radical is important for maintaining the reaction. In the<br>
earth's weak magnetic field, Zeeman splitting for hydrogen is around 30 KHz. Thus, the<br>
hydrogen atoms in the holoreaction system, could be energized by applying to them a<br>
Zeeman splitting frequency for hydrogen (e.g., 30 KHz). Energizing the hydrogen atoms in<br>
the holoreaction system will duplicate the mechanisms of action of platinum, and catalyze the<br>
reaction. If the reaction was moved into outer space, away from the earth's weak magnetic<br>
field, hydrogen would no longer have a 30 KHz Zeeman splitting frequency, and the 30 KHz<br>
would no longer as effectively catalyze the reaction.<br>
The vast majority of materials on this planet, by virtue of existing within the earth's<br>
weak magnetic field, will exhibit Zeeman splitting in the hertz and kilohertz regions. This<br>
applies to biologies and organics as well as inorganic or inanimate materials. Humans are<br>
composed of a wide variety of atoms, diamagnetic molecules, and second order effect<br>
paramagnetic molecules. These atoms and molecules all exist in the earth's weak magnetic<br>
field. These atoms and molecules in humans all have Zeeman splitting in the hertz and<br>
kilohertz regions, because they are in the earth's magnetic; field. Biochemical and<br>
biocatalytic processes in humans are thus sensitive to hertz and kilohertz electromagnetic<br>
radiation, by virtue of the fact that they are in the earth's weak magnetic field. As long as<br>
humans continue to exist on this planet, they will be subject to spectral energy catalyst effects,<br>
from hertz and kilohertz EM waves because of the Zeeman effect from the planet's magnetic<br>
field. This has significant implications for low frequency communications, as well as<br>
chemical and biochemical reactions, diagnostics, and treatment of diseases.<br>
A strong magnetic field will produce splitting greater than the hyperfine frequencies,<br>
in the microwave and infrared regions of the EM spectrum in atoms and paramagnetic<br>
molecules. In the hydrogen/oxygen reaction, a strong field could be added to the<br>
holoreaction system and transmit MHz and/or GHz frequencies into the reaction to energize<br>
the hydroxy radical and hydrogen reaction intermediates. If physical platinum was used to<br>
catalyze the reaction, the application of a particular magnetic field strength could result in<br>
both the platinum and the reaction intermediate spectra having frequencies that were split and<br>
shifted in such a way that even more frequencies matched than without the magnetic field. In<br>
this way, Zeeman splitting can be used to improve the effectiveness of a physical catalyst, by<br>
copying its mechanism of action (i.e., more frequencies could be caused to match and thus<br>
more energy could transfer).<br>
A moderate magnetic field will produce Zeeman splitting in atoms and paramagnetic<br>
molecules at frequencies on par with the hyperfine and rotational splitting frequencies. This<br>
means that a holoreaction system can be energized without even adding electromagnetic<br>
energy. Similarly, by placing the holoreaction system in a moderate magnetic field that<br>
produces Zeeman splitting equal to the hyperfine or rotational splitting, increased reaction<br>
would occur. For instance, by using a magnetic field that causes hyperfine or rotational<br>
splitting in hydrogen and oxygen gas, that matches the Zeeman splitting in hydrogen atom or<br>
hydroxy radicals, the hydrogen or hydroxy intermediate would be energized and would<br><br>
proceed through the reaction cascade to produce water. By using the appropriately tuned<br>
moderate magnetic field, the magnetic field could be used to turn the reactants into catalysts<br>
for their own reaction, without the addition of physical catalyst platinum or the spectral<br>
catalyst of platinum. Although the magnetic field would simply be copying the mechanism<br>
of action of platinum, the reaction would have the appearance of being catalyzed solely by an<br>
applied magnetic field.<br>
Finally, consider the direction of the magnetic field in relation to the orientation of the<br>
molecule. When the magnetic field is parallel to an exciting electromagnetic field, n<br>
frequencies are produced. When the magnetic field is perpendicular to an exciting<br>
electromagnetic field, s frequencies are found. Assume that there is an industrial chemical<br>
holoreaction system that uses the same (or similar) starting reactants, but the goal is to be<br>
able to produce different products at will. By using magnetic fields combined with spectral<br>
energy or physical catalysts, the reaction can be guided to one set of products or another. For<br>
the first set of products, the electromagnetic excitation is oriented parallel to the magnetic<br>
field, producing one set of p frequencies, which leads to a first set of products. To achieve a<br>
different product, the direction of the magnetic field is changed so that it is perpendicular to<br>
the exciting electromagnetic field. This produces a different set of a frequencies, and a<br>
different reaction pathway is energized, thus producing a different set of products. Thus,<br>
according to the present invention, magnetic field effects, Zeeman splitting, splitting and<br>
spectral energy catalysts can be used to fine-tune the specificity of many holoreaction<br>
systems.<br>
In summary, by understanding the underlying spectral mechanism to chemical<br>
reactions, magnetic fields can be used as yet another tool to catalyze and modify those<br>
chemical reactions by modifying the spectral characteristics of at least one participant and/or<br>
at least one component in the holoreaction system.<br>
REACTION VESSEL AND CONDITIONING REACTION VESSEL SIZE. SHAPE AND<br>
COMPOSITION<br>
An important consideration in the use of spectral chemistry is the reaction vessel size,<br>
shape and composition. The reaction vessel size and shape can affect the vessel's NOF to<br>
various wave energies (e.g., electromagnetic, acoustic, electrical current, etc). This in turn<br>
may affect holoreaction system dynamics. For instance, a particularly small bench-top<br>
reaction vessel may have an electromagnetic NOF of 1,420 MHz related to a 25 cm<br>
dimension, When a reaction with an atomic hydrogen intermediate is performed in the small<br>
bench-top reaction the reaction proceeds quickly, due in part to the fact that the reactor vessel<br>
and the hydrogen hyperfine splitting frequencies match (1,420 MHz). This allows the<br>
reaction vessel and hydrogen intermediates to resonate, thus transferring energy to the<br>
intermediate and promoting the reaction pathway.<br>
When the reaction is scaled up for large industrial production, the reaction would<br>
occur in a much larger reaction vessel with an electromagnetic NOF of, for example, 100<br>
MHz. Because the reaction vessel is no longer resonating with the hydrogen intermediate,<br>
the reaction proceeds at a slower rate. This deficiency in the larger reaction vessel can be<br>
compensated for, by, for example, supplementing the reaction with 1,420 MHz radiation,<br>
thereby restoring the faster reaction rate.<br>
Likewise, reaction vessel (or conditioning reaction vessel) composition may play a<br>
similar role in holoreaction system dynamics. For example, a stainless steel bench-top<br>
reaction vessel may produce vibrational frequencies which resonate with vibrational<br>
frequencies of a reactant, thus, for example, promoting disassociation of a reactant into<br>
reactive intermediates. When the reaction is scaled up for industrial production, it may be<br>
placed into, for example, a ceramic-lined metal reactor vessel. The new reaction vessel<br>
typically will not produce the reactant vibrational frequency, and the reaction will proceed at<br>
a slower rate. Once again, this deficiency in the new reaction vessel, caused by its different<br>
composition, can be compensated for either by returning the reaction to a stainless steel<br>
vessel, or by supplementing, for example, the vibrational frequency of the reactant into the<br>
ceramic-lined vessel; and/or conditioning the reaction vessel with a suitable conditioning<br>
energy prior to some or all of the other components of the reaction system being introduced<br>
into the reaction vessel.<br>
It should now be understood that all the aspects of spectral chemistry previously<br>
discussed (resonance, targeting, poisons, promoters, supporters, electric and magnetic-fields<br>
both endogenous and exogenous to holoreaction system components, etc.) apply to the<br>
reaction vessel (or conditioning reaction vessel), as well as to. for example, any participant<br>
(or conditionable participant) placed inside it. The reaction vessel (or conditioning reaction<br>
vessel) may be comprised of matter (e.g.. stainless steel, plastic, glass, and/or ceramic, etc.)<br>
or it may be comprised of a field or energy (e.g., magnetic bottle, light trapping, etc.) A<br>
reaction vessel (or conditioning reactor vessel), by possessing inherent properties such as<br>
frequences, waves, and/or fields, may interact with other components in the holoreaction<br>
system and/or at least one participant. Likewise, holding vessels, conduits, etc., some of<br>
which may interact with the holoreaction system, but in which the reaction does not actually<br>
take place, may interact with one or more components in the holoreaction system and may<br>
potentially affect them, either positively or negatively. Accordingly, when reference is made<br>
to the reaction vessel, it should be understood that all portions associated therewith may also<br>
be involved in desirable reactions.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention will be more clearly perceived and better understood from the<br>
following specific examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST<br>
IN A GAS PHASE REACTION<br>
2H2 + O2 »» platinum catalyst»» 2H2O<br>
Water can be produced by the method of exposing H2 and O2 to a physical platinum<br>
(Pt) catalyst but there is always the possibility of producing a potentially dangerous explosive<br>
risk. This experiment replaced the physical platinum catalyst with a spectral catalyst<br>
comprising the spectral pattern of the physical platinum catalyst, which resonates with and<br>
transfers energy to the hydrogen and hydroxy intermediates.<br>
To demonstrate that oxygen and hydrogen can combine to form water utilizing a<br>
spectral catalyst, electrolysis of water was performed to provide stoichiometric amounts of<br>
oxygen and hydrogen starting gases. A triple neck flask was fitted with two (2) rubber<br>
stoppers on the outside necks, each fitted with platinum electrodes encased in glass for a four<br>
(4) inch length. The flask was filled with distilled water and a pinch of salt so that only the<br>
glass-encased portion of the electrode was exposed to air, and the unencased portion of the<br>
electrode was completely under water. The central neck was connected via a rubber stopper<br>
to vacuum tubing, which led to a Drierite column to remove any water from the produced<br>
gases.<br>
After vacuum removal of all gases in the system (to about 700 mm Hg), electrolysis<br>
was conducted using a 12 V power source attached to the two electrodes. Electrolysis was<br>
commenced with the subsequent production of hydrogen and oxygen gases in stoichiometric<br>
amounts. The gases passed through the Drierite column, through vacuum tubing connected<br><br>
to positiye and negative pressure gauges and into a sealed 1,000 ml, round quartz flask. A<br>
strip of filter paper, which contained dried cobalt, had been placed in the bottom of the sealed<br>
flask. Initially the cobalt paper was blue, indicating the absence of water in the flask. A<br>
similar cobalt test strip exposed to the ambient air was also blue.<br>
- The traditional physical platinum catalyst was replaced by spectral catalyst platinum<br>
electronic frequencies (with their attendant fine and hyperfine frequencies) from a Fisher<br>
Scientific Hollow Cathode Platinum Lamp which was positioned approximately one inch<br>
(about 2 cm) from the flask. This allowed the oxygen and hydrogen gases in the round quartz<br>
flask to be irradiated with emissions from the spectral catalyst. A Cathodeon Hollow<br>
Cathode Lamp Supply C610 was used to power the Pt lamp at 80% maximum current (12<br>
mAmps). The reaction flask was cooled using dry ice in a Styrofoam container positioned<br>
directly beneath the round quartz flask, offsetting any effects of heat from the Pt lamp. The<br>
Pt lamp was turned on and within two days of irradiation, a noticeable pink color was evident<br>
on the cobalt paper strip indicating the presence of water in the round quartz flask. The<br>
cobalt test strip exposed to ambient air in the lab remained blue. Over the next four to five<br>
days, the pink colored area on the cobalt strip became brighter and larger. Upon<br>
discontinuation of the Pt emission, H2O diffused out of the cobalt strip and was taken up by<br>
the Drierite column. Over the next four to five days, the pink coloration of the cobalt strip in<br>
the quartz flask faded. The cobalt strip exposed to the ambient air remained blue.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect chemical reactions in a<br>
gas phase.<br>

REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRL CATALYST<br>
IN A LIQUID PHASE REACTION<br>
H2O2 »» platinum catalyst»» H2O + O2<br>
The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is an extremely slow reaction in the absence<br>
of catalysts. Accordingly, an experiment was performed which showed that the physical<br>
catalyst, finely divided platinum, could be replaced with the spectral catalyst having the<br>
spectral pattern of platinum. Hydrogen peroxide, 3%, filled two (2) nippled quartz tubes,<br>
(the nippled quartz tubes consisted of a lower portion about 17 mm internal diameter and<br>
about 150 mm in length, narrowing over about a 10 mm length to an upper capillary portion<br>
being about 2.0 mm internal diameter and about 140 mm m length and were made from<br>
Photo Vac Laser quartz tubing). Both quartz tubes were inverted in 50 ml beaker reservoirs<br>
filled with (3%) hydrogen peroxide to about 40 ml and were shielded from incident light<br>
(cardboard cylinders covered with aluminum foil). One of the light shielded tubes was used<br>
as a control. The other shielded tube was exposed to a Fisher Scientific Hollow Cathode<br>
Lamp for platinum (Pt) using a Cathodeon Hollow Cathode Lamp Supply C610, at 80%<br>
maximum current (12 mA). The experiment was performed several times with an exposure<br>
time ranging from about 24 to about 96 hours. The shielded tubes were monitored for<br>
increases in temperature (there was none) to assure that any reaction was not due to thermal<br>
effects. In a typical experiment the nippled tubes were prepared with hydrogen peroxide<br>
(3%) as described above herein. Both tubes were shielded from light, and the Pt tube was<br>
exposed to platinum spectral emissions, as described above, for about 24 hours. Gas<br>
production in the control tube A measured about four (4) mm in length in the capillary (i.e.,<br>
aboutl2.5 mm3), while gas in the Pt (tube B) measured about 50 mm (i.e.. about 157 mm3).<br>
The platinum spectral catalyst thus increased the reaction rate about 12.5 times.<br>
The tubes were then switched and tube A was exposed to the platinum spectral<br>
catalyst, for about 24 hours, while tube B served as the control. Gas production in the control<br>
(tube B) measured about 2 mm in length in the capillary (i.e., about 6 mm3) while gas in the<br>
Pt tube (tube A) measured about 36 mm (i.e., about 113 mm3), yielding about a 19 fold<br>
difference in reaction rate.<br>
As a negative control, to confirm that any lamp would not cause the same result, the<br>
experiment was repeated with a sodium lamp at 6 mA (80% of the maximum current). Na in<br>
a traditional reaction would be a reactant with water releasing hydrogen gas, not a catalyst of<br>
hydrogen peroxide breakdown. The control tube measured gas to be about 4 mm in length<br>
(i.e., about 12 mm3) in the capillary portion, while the Na tube gas measured to be about<br>
1 mm in length (i.e., about 3 mm3). This indicated that while spectral emissions can<br>
substitute for catalysts, they cannot yet substitute for reactants. Also, it indicated that the<br>
simple effect of using a hollow cathode tube emitting heat and energy into the hydrogen<br>
peroxide, was not the cause of the gas bubble formation, but instead, the spectral pattern of Pt<br>
replacing the physical catalyst caused the reaction.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect a chemical reaction in a<br>
liquid phase and subsequent transformation to a gas phase.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST<br>
IN A SOLID PHASE REACTION<br>
It is well known that certain microorganisms have a toxic reaction to silver (Ag). The<br>
silver electronic spectrum consists of essentially two ultraviolet frequencies that fall between<br>
UV-A and UV-B. It is now understood through this invention, that the high intensity spectral<br>
frequencies produced in the silver electronic spectrum are ultraviolet frequencies that inhibit<br>
bacterial growth (by creation of free radicals and by causing bacterial DNA damage). These<br>
UV frequencies are essentially harmless to mammalian cells. Thus, it was theorized that the<br>
known medicinal and anti-microbial uses of silver are due to a spectral catalyst effect. In this<br>
regard, an experiment was conducted which showed that the spectral catalyst emitting the<br>
spectrum of silver demonstrated a toxic or inhibitory effect on microorganisms.<br>
Bacterial cultures were placed onto standard growth medium in two petri dishes (one<br>
control and one Ag) using standard plating techniques covering the entire dish. Each dish<br>
was placed at the bottom of a light shielding cylindrical chamber. A light shielding foil-<br>
covered, cardboard disc with a patterned slit was placed over each culture plate. A Fisher<br>
Scientific Hollow Cathode Lamp for Silver (Ag) was inserted through the top of the Ag<br>
exposure chamber so that only the spectral emission pattern from the silver lamp was<br>
irradiating the bacteria on the Ag culture plate (i.e., through the patterned slit). A Cathodeon<br>
Hollow Cathode Lamp Supply C610 was used to power the Ag lamp at about 80% maximum<br>
current (3.6 mA). The control plate was not exposed to emissions of an Ag lamp, and<br>
ambient light was blocked. Both control and Ag plates were maintained at room temperature<br>
(e.g., about 70 - 74T) during the silver spectral emission exposure time, which ranged from<br>
about 12-24 hours in the various experiments. Afterwards, both plates were incubated using<br>
standard techniques (37°C, aerobic Forma Scientific Model 3157. Water-Jacketed Incubator)<br>
for about 24 hours.<br>
The following bacteria (obtained from the Microbiology Laboratory at People's<br>
Hospital in Mansfield, Ohio, US), were studied for effects of the Ag lamp spectral emissions:<br>
1. E. coli;<br>
2. Strep, pneumoniae;<br>
3. Staph, aureus; and<br>
4. Salmonella typhi.<br>
This group included both Gram+ and Gram- species, as well as cocci and rods.<br>
Results were as follows:<br>
1. Controls - all controls showed full growth covering the culture plates;<br>
2. The Ag plates<br>
- areas unexposed to the Ag spectral emission pattern showed full growth.<br>
- areas exposed to the Ag spectral emission pattern showed:<br>
a. E. coli - no growth;<br>
b. Strep, pneumoniae - no growth;<br>
c. Staph, aureus - no growth; and<br>
d. Salmonella tyhli - inhibited growth.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to catalyze chemical reactions in<br>
in biological organisms. These reactions inhibited growth of the biological organisms.<br>

COMPARING RESULTS TO PHYSICAL CATALYST RESULTS IN A BIOLOGIC<br>
PREPARATION<br>
To further demonstrate that certain susceptible organisms which have a toxic reaction<br>
to silver would have a similar reaction to the spectral catalyst emitting the spectrum of silver,<br>
cultures were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) which included<br>
Escherichia coli #25922, and Klebsiella pneumonia, subsp Pneumoniae, # 13883. Control<br>
and Ag plate cultures were performed as described above. After incubation, plates were<br>
examined using a binocular microscope. The E. coli exhibited moderate resistance to the<br>
bactericidal effects of the spectral silver emission, while the Klebsiella exhibited moderate<br>
sensitivity. All controls exhibited full growth.<br>
Accordingly, an experiment was performed which demonstrated a similar result using<br>
the physical silver catalyst as was obtained with the Ag spectral catalyst. Sterile test discs<br>
were soaked in an 80 ppm, colloidal silver solution. The same two (2) organisms were again<br>
plated, as described above. Colloidal silver test discs were placed on each Ag plate, while the<br>
control plates had none. The plates were incubated as described above and examined under<br>
the binocular microscope. The colloidal silver E. coli. exhibited moderate resistance to the<br>
bactericidal effects of the physical colloidal silver, while the Klebsiella again exhibited<br>
moderate sensitivity. All controls exhibited full growth.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
AUGMENTING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST<br>
To demonstrate that oxygen and hydrogen can combine to form water utilizing a<br>
spectral catalyst to augment a physical catalyst, electrolysis of water was performed to<br>
provide the necessary oxygen and hydrogen starting gases, as in Example 1.<br>
Two quartz flasks (A and B) were connected separately after the Drierite column,<br>
each with its own set of vacuum and pressure gauges. Platinum powder (about 31 mg) was<br>
placed in each flask. The flasks were filled with electrolytically produced stoichiometric<br>
amounts of H2 and O2 to 120 mm Hg. The flasks were separated by a stopcock from the<br>
electrolysis system and from each other. The pressure in each flask was recorded over time<br>
as the reaction proceeded over the physical platinum catalyst. The reaction combines three<br>
(3) moles of gases, (i.e., two (2) moles H2 and one (1) mole O2), to produce two (2) moles<br>
H2O. This decrease in molarity, and hence progress of the reaction, can be monitored by a<br>
decrease in pressure "P" which is proportional, via the ideal gas law, (PV = nRT), to molarity<br>
"n". A baseline rate of reaction was thus obtained. Additionally, the test was repeated filling<br>
each flask with H2 and O2 to 220 mm Hg. Catalysis of the reaction by only the physical<br>
catalyst yielded two baseline reaction curves which were in good agreement between flasks A<br>
and B, and for both the 110 mm and 220 mm Hg tests.<br>
Next, the traditional physical platinum catalyst in flask A was augmented with<br>
spectral catalyst platinum emissions from two (2) parallel Fisher Scientific Hollow Cathode<br>
Platinum Lamps, as in Example 1, which were positioned approximately two (2) cm from<br>
flask A. The test was repeated as described above, separating the two (2) flasks from each<br>
other and monitoring the rate of the reaction via the pressure decrease in each. Flask B<br>
served as a control flask. In flask A, the oxygen and hydrogen gases, as well as the physical<br>
platinum catalyst, were directly irradiated with emissions from the Pt lamp spectral catalyst.<br>
Rate of reaction in the control flask B, was in good agreement with previous baseline<br>
rates. Rate of reaction in flask "A", wherein physical platinum catalyst was augmented with<br>
the platinum spectral pattern, exhibited an overall mean increase of 60%, with a maximal<br>
increase of 70% over the baseline and flask B.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to change the chemical reaction<br>
properties of a solid catalyst in a gas phase (heterogeneous) reaction system.<br>

FREQUENCY<br>
AND<br>
REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A FINE STRUCTURE FREQUENCY<br>
THE ALPHA ROTATION-VIBRATION CONSTANT<br>
Water was electrolyzed to produce stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and oxygen<br>
gases as described above herein. Additionally, a dry ice cooled stainless steel coil was placed<br>
immediately after the Drierite column. After vacuum removal of all gases in the system,<br>
electrolysis was accomplished using a 12 V power source attached to the two electrodes,<br>
resulting in a production of hydrogen and oxygen gases. After passing through the Drierite<br>
column, the hydrogen and oxygen gases passed through vacuum tubing connected to positive<br>
and negative pressure gauges, through the dry ice cooled stainless steel coil and then to a<br>
1,000 ml round, quartz flask. A strip of filter paper impregnated with dry (blue) cobalt was in<br>
the bottom of the quartz flask, as an indicator of the presence or absence of water.<br>
The entire system was vacuum evacuated to a pressure of about 700 mm Hg below<br>
atmospheric pressure. Electrolysis was performed, producing hydrogen and oxygen gases in<br>
stoichiometric amounts, to result in a pressure of about 220 mm Hg above atmospheric<br>
pressure. The center of the quartz flask, now containing hydrogen and oxygen gases, was<br>
irradiated for approximately 12 hours with continuous microwave electromagnetic radiation<br>
emitted from a Hewlett Packard microwave spectroscopy system which included an HP<br>
83350B Sweep Oscillator, an HP 851 OB Network Analyzer and an HP 8513A Reflection<br>
Transmission Test Set. The frequency used was 21.4 GHz, which corresponds to a fine<br>
splitting constant, the alpha rotation-vibration constant, of the hydroxy intermediate, and is<br>
thus a harmonic resonant heterodyne for the hydroxy radical. The cobalt strip changed<br>
strongly in color to pink which indicated the presence of water in the quartz flask, whose<br>
creation was catalyzed by a harmonic resonant heterodyne frequency for the hydroxy radical.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control a gas phase chemical<br>
reaction.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A HYPERFINE SPLITTING FREQUENCY<br>
An experimental dark room was prepared, in which there is no ambient light, and<br>
which can be totally darkened. A shielded, ground room (Ace Shielded Room, Ace,<br>
Philadelphia, PA, US, Model A6H3-16; 8 feet wide, 17 feet long, and 8 feet high (about 2.<br>
meters x 5.2 meters x 2.4 meters) copper mesh) was installed inside the dark room.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide (3%) was placed in nippled quartz tubes, which were then<br>
inverted in beakers filled with (3%) hydrogen peroxide, as described in greater detail herein.<br>
The tubes were allowed to rest for about 18 hours in the dark room, covered with non-<br>
metallic light blocking hoods (so that the room could be entered without exposing the tubes<br>
to light). Baseline measurements of gases in the mppled tubes were then performed.<br>
Three nippled RF tubes were placed on a wooden grid table in the shielded room, in<br>
the center of grids 4, 54, and 127; corresponding to distances of about 107 cm, 187 cm, and<br>
312 cm respectively, from a frequency-emitting antenna (copper tubing 15 mm diameter,<br>
4.7 m octagonal circumference, with the center frequency at approximately 6.5 MHz. A 25<br>
watt, 17 MHz signal was sent to the antenna. This frequency corresponds to a hyperfine<br>
splitting frequency of the hydrogen atom, which is a transient in the dissociation of hydrogen<br>
peroxide. The antenna was pulsed continuously by a BK Precision RF Signal Generator<br>
Model 2005A, and amplified by an Amplifier Research amplifier, Model 25A-100. A control<br>
tube was placed on a wooden cart immediately adjacent to the shielded room, in the dark<br>
room. All tubes were covered with non-metallic light blocking hoods.<br>
After about 18 hours, gas production from dissociation of hydrogen peroxide and<br>
resultant oxygen formation in the nippled tubes was measured The RF tube closest to the<br>
antenna produced 11 mm length gas in the capillary (34 mm3), the tube intermediate to the<br>
antenna produced a 5 mm length (10 mm3) gas, and the RF tube farthest from the antenna<br>
produced no gas. The control tube produced 1 mm gas. Thus, it can be concluded that the. RF<br>
hyperfine splitting frequency for hydrogen increased the reaction rate approximately five (5)<br>
to ten (10) times.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energy was used to control a chemical reaction in a<br>
liquid phase, resulting in a transformation to a gas phase.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
REPLACING A PHYSICAL CATALYST WITH A MAGNETIC FIELD<br>
Hydrogen peroxide (15%) was placed in nippled quartz tubes, which were then<br>
inverted in beakers filled with (15%) hydrogen peroxide, as described above. The tubes were<br>
allowed to rest for about four (4) hours on a wooden table in a shielded cage, in a dark room.<br>
Baseline measurements of gases in the nippled tubes were then performed.<br>
Remaining in the shielded cage, in the dark room, two (2) control tubes were left on a<br>
wooden table as controls. Two (2) magnetic field tubes were placed on the center platform of<br>
an ETS Helmholtz single axis coil, Model 6402, 1.06 gauss/Ampere, pulsed at about S3 Hz<br>
by a BK Precision 20 MHz Sweep/Function Generator, Model 4040. The voltage output of<br>
the function generator was adjusted to produce an alternating magnetic field of about 19.5<br>
milliGauss on the center platform of the Helmholtz Coil, as measured by a Holaday Model<br>
HI-3627, three (3) axis ELF magnetic field meter and probe. Hydrogen atoms, which are a<br>
transient in the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide, exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance via<br>
Zeeman splitting at this applied frequency and applied magnetic field strength. Thus,<br>
frequency of the alternating magnetic field was resonant with the hydrogen transients.<br>
After about 18 hours, gas production from dissociation of hydrogen peroxide and<br>
resultant oxygen formation in the nippled tubes was measured. The control tubes averaged<br>
about 180 mm gas formation (540mm3) while the tubes exposed to the alternating magnetic<br>
field produced about 810 mm gas (2,430 mm3), resulting in an increase in the reaction rate of<br>
approximately four (4) times.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
NEGATIVELY CATALYZING A REACTION WITH AN ELECTRIC FIELD<br>
Hydrogen peroxide (15%) was placed in four (4) nippled quartz tubes which were<br>
inverted in hydrogen peroxide (15%) filled beakers, as described in greater detail above<br>
herein. The tubes were placed on a wooden table, in a shielded room, in a dark room. After<br>
four (4) hours, baseline measurements were taken of the gas in the capillary portion of the<br>
tubes.<br>
An Amplifier Research self-contained electromagnetic mode cell ("TEM") Model<br>
TC1510A had been placed in the dark, shielded room. A sine wave signal of about 133 MHz<br>
was provided to the TEM cell by a BK Precision RF Signal Generator, Model 2005 A, and an<br>
Amplifier Research amplifier, Model 25A100. Output levels on the signal generator and<br>
amplifier wave adjusted to produce an electric field (E-field) of about five (5) V/m in the<br>
center of the TEM cell, as measured with a Holaday Industries electric field probe, Model HI-<br>
4433GRE, placed in the center of the lower chamber.<br>
Two of the hydrogen peroxide filled tubes were placed- in the center of the upper<br>
chamber of the TEM cell, about 35 cm from the wall of the shielded room. The other two (2)<br>
tubes served as controls and were placed on a wooden table, also about 35 cm from the same<br>
wall of the shielded, dark room, and removed from the immediate vicinity of the TEM cell,<br>
so that there was no ambient electric field, as confirmed by E-field probe measurements.<br>
The 133 MHz alternating sine wave signal delivered to the TEM cell was well above<br>
the typical line width frequency at room temperature (e.g., about 100 KHz) and was theorized<br>
to be resonant with an n=20 Rydberg state of the hydrogen atom as derived from<br><br>
where E is the change in energy in cm-1, c is 7.51 +/- 0.02 for the hydrogen state n = 20 and E<br>
is the electric field intensity in (Kv/cm)2.<br>
After about five (5) hours of exposure to the electric field, the mean gas production in<br>
the tubes subjected to the E-field was about 17.5 mm, while mean gas production in the<br>
control tubes was about 58 mm.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory or explanation, it is believed<br>
that the alternating electric field resonated with an upper energy level in the hydrogen atoms,<br>
producing a negative Stark effect, and thereby negatively catalyzing the reaction.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
AUGMENTATION OF A PHYSICAL CATALYST BY IRRADIATING<br>
REACTANTS/TRANSIENTS WITH A SPECTRAL CATALYST<br>
Hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced in stoichiometric amounts by electrolysis,<br>
as previously described in greater detail above herein. A stainless steel coil cooled in dry ice<br>
was placed immediately after the Drierite column. Positive and negative pressure gauges<br>
were connected after the coil, and then a 1,000 ml round quartz flask was sequentially<br>
connected with a second set of pressure gauges.<br>
At the beginning of each experimental run, the entire, system was vacuum evacuated<br>
to a pressure of about minus 650 mm Hg. The system was sealed for about 15 minutes to<br>
confirm the maintenance of the generated vacuum and integrity of the connections.<br>
Electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases was performed, as described<br>
previously.<br>
Initially, about 10 mg of finely divided platinum was placed into the round quartz<br>
flask. Reactant gases were allowed to react over the platinum and the reaction rate was<br>
monitored by increasing the rate of pressure drop over time, as previously described. The<br>
starting pressure was approximately in the mid-90's mm Hg positive pressure, and the ending<br>
pressure was approximately in the low 30's over the amount of time that measurements were<br>
taken. Two (2) control runs were performed, with reaction rates of about 0.47 mm Hg/minute<br>
and about 0.48 mm Hg/minute.<br>
For the third run, a single platinum lamp was applied, as previously described, except<br>
that the operating current was reduced to about eight (8) mA and the lamp was positioned<br>
through the center of the flask to irradiate only the reactant/transient gases, and not the<br>
physical platinum catalyst. The reaction rate was determined, as described above, and was<br>
found to be about 0.63 mm Hg/minute, an increase of 34%.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
APPARENT POISONING OF A REACTION BY THE SPECTRAL PATTERN<br>
OF A PHYSICAL POISON<br>
The conversion of hydrogen and oxygen gases to water, over a stepped platinum<br>
physical catalyst, is known to be poisoned by gold. Addition of gold to this platinum<br>
catalyzed reaction reduces reaction rates by about 95%. The gold blocks only about one sixth<br>
of the platinum binding sites, which according to prior art, would need to be blocked to<br>
poison the physical catalyst to this degree. Thus, it was theorized that a spectral interaction<br>
of the physical gold with the physical platinum and/or reaction system could also be<br>
responsible for the poisoning effects of gold on the reaction It was further theorized that<br>
addition of the gold spectral pattern to the reaction catalyzed by physical platinum could also<br>
poison the reaction.<br>
Hydrogen and oxygen gases were produced by electrolysis, as described above in<br>
greater detail. Finely directed platinum, about 15 mg, was added to the round quartz flask.<br>
Starting pressures were about in the 90's mm Hg positive pressure, and ending pressures<br>
were about in the 2O's mm Hg over the amount of time that measurements were taken.<br>
Reaction rates were determined as previously described. The first control run revealed a<br>
reaction rate of about 0.81 mm Hg/minute.<br>
In the second run, a Fisher Hollow Cathode Gold lamp was applied, as previously<br>
described, at an operating frequency of about eight (8) niA, (S0% maximum current),<br>
through about the center of the round flask. The reaction rate increased to about 0.S7 mm<br>
Hg/minute.<br>
A third run was then performed on the same reaction flask and physical platinum that<br>
had been in the flask exposed to the gold spectral pattern. The reaction rate decreased to<br>
about 0.75 mm Hg/minute.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control an environmental<br>
reaction condition (poison) and change the chemical reaction properties of a physical catalyst<br>
in a heterogeneous catalyst reaction system.<br>

U. S. Model A6H3-16, copper mesh, with a width of about eight feet, a length of about 17<br>
feet and a height of about eight feet (about 2.4 meters x 5.2 meters x 2.4 meters).<br>
b) Preparation of Solutions<br>
i) Classical Solution - The apparatus used to make a classical solution is shown<br>
schematically in Figure 70. Water (about 800 ml) was placed into a glass Beaker 104 and<br>
was heated with a Bunsen burner 101 from room temperature to about 55°C in about 6-12<br>
minutes. Salt was added in about 50 gram amounts and the solution 105 was stirred with a<br>
glass stir rod (not shown) until no more salt would dissolve and undissolved salt remained on<br>
the bottom of the Beaker 104. The solution 105 was then allowed to equilibrate overnight<br>
(about 16 hours) before being decanted for use in the various crystallization experiments<br>
discussed later herein.<br>
ii) Conditioned Solution - The apparatus used to make a conditioned solution is<br>
shown in Figure 71. Water (about 800 ml) was heated by the sodium lamp 112 and housing<br>
111, which together were positioned below the Beaker 104. The light from the bulb 112 was<br>
made to be incident on the bottom of the Beaker 104 through an aluminum foil cylinder 110<br>
which functioned as a light guide. The temperature of the solution 105 was raised to about<br>
55°C in about 40 minutes. Salt was added in about 50 gram amounts and the solution 105<br>
was stirred with a glass stir rod until no more salt would dissolve and undissolved salt<br>
remained on the bottom of the Beaker 104. The solution 105 was allowed to equilibrate<br>
overnight (about 16 hours) before being decanted for use in the various crystallization<br>
experiments discussed later herein.<br>
The D lines in the sodium electronic spectrum are resonant with vibrational overtones<br>
of water. Engineering, these vibrational overtones of water changes its material properties as<br>
a solvent. Thus, the sodium lamp can be used to condition the water and change its material<br>
properties before it is used in a crystallization solution.<br>
c) Crystallization Procedures<br>
i) Classical Crystallization - Saturated solution was placed in a beaker or in a<br>
crystallization dish and left undisturbed in the presence of ambient overhead fluorescent<br>
lighting.<br>
ii) Spectral Crystallization - Prepared solution (both saturated and slightly diluted<br>
solutions - depending on the specific example) was placed in a beaker or in a crystallization<br>
dish and left undisturbed in the presence of irradiation from one or more positioned sodium<br>
or potassium lamps (as discussed in each Example). The sodium electronic spectrum<br>
produced by the sodium lamp affected NaCl phase changes.<br>
d) Spectral Delivery Configurations<br>
i) Cone - Aluminum foil cone light guide fitted around a sodium light bulb, extending<br>
about 23 cm from the bulb, with the distal end formed around a uniform diameter of about<br>
1.8 cm.<br>
ii) Cylinder - Aluminum foil cylinder light guide fitted around a sodium light bulb,<br>
extending about 23 cm from the bulb, with a uniform diameter of about 6 cm.<br>
iii) Parabolic - Aluminum dish (e.g., from a small stove-top burner) fitted around a<br>
sodium light bulb without a foil light guide.<br>
e) Ambient Lighting<br>
All experimental conditions described in the Examples occurred in the presence of<br>
standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe<br>
Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts, and were each about eight (8) feet long (about 2.4 meters long).<br>
The lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above the laboratory counter on<br>
which the experimental set-up was located. There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a<br>
room which measured approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (7.6 meters x 12.1 meters).<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml) at room temperature (22°C) was<br>
placed into Beaker #1. A spectral saturated NaCl solution (about 100 ml) at room<br>
temperature (22°C) was placed into Beaker #2. Beaker #3 with about 100 ml classical<br>
solution and Beaker #4 with about 100 ml of spectral solution were placed into an aluminum<br>
foil-wrapped bucket as controls. Beakers #1 and #2 were eacn placed under a single<br>
overhead sodium lamp 112 with a cone delivery configuration 120 (as shown in Figure 72).<br>
Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 20 hours) under ambient overhead fluorescent<br>
lighting.<br>
Results: Beakers #1 and #2 showed increased primary nucleation, and increased<br>
growth rate compared to the controls. Beaker #2, with a spectral solution, showed<br>
substantially increased primary nucleation and more overall crystallization (about 3.8 grams<br>
total) compared to the classical solution in Beaker #1 (about 3.3 grams total). In addition,<br>
crystals from the spectral solution had an altered morphology which included glass sheets,<br>
pyramid structures, and hollow pyramids inside cubic structures.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control phase changes and<br>
material properties in liquid and solid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Classical saturated NaCl solution (about 50 ml) made about seven 7 days before and<br>
made on a counter about 10 feet away from the nearest sodium lamp during Example 12, was<br>
placed into each of three separate beakers in a dark, shielded room. Spectral cone<br>
crystallization in various configurations, with no ambient light, proceeded overnight as<br>
follows: 1) single horizontal sodium lamp (Figure 75a); 2) two horizontal sodium lamps at<br>
right angles to each other (Figure 75b); and 3) two horizontal lamps at right angles to each<br>
other and one overhead lamp (Figure 75c).<br>
Results: Compared to classical solutions not exposed to ambient sodium spectral<br>
irradiation, this solution grew crystals that exhibited substantially increased primary<br>
nucleation and all crystals were small (e.g., less than 1 mm) sand-like crystals.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control phase changes and<br>
material properties in liquid and solid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Classical saturated NaCl solution prepared as above was; filtered and about 50 ml was<br>
placed into each of three beakers which were then placed into the aforementioned shielded<br>
room. Beaker #1 had four horizontal sodium lamps with cones (Figure 75d), and all at<br>
approximate right angles to each other. Beaker #2 had four overhead sodium lamps with<br>
cones, and positioned at right angles to each other and at about a 45 degree angle from the<br>
horizontal (Figure 75e). Beaker #3 was placed in a control bucket. Crystallization proceeded<br>
overnight (about 18 hours) with no ambient light present in the shielded room.<br>
Results: Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps at right angles and as shown in<br>
Figure 75d) grew cubes (about 4-11 mm on a side) and large crystals with significant<br>
twinning (about 16 mm on a side). Four overhead sodium lamps at approximate 45° angles<br>
(Figure 75e), grew twinned cubes (about 5-10 mm) and large hoppers (with the largest<br>
measuring about 13x13x7 mm). Figures 81a and 81b show some of the crystals grown<br>
according to this Example, with Figure 81b showing the largest crystal grown. The control in<br>
total darkness showed no growth.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control phase changes,<br>
structures, and material properties in solid and liquid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
The experimental procedure was identical to the experimental procedure of Example<br>
14, except that spectral NaCl solution was used rather than classical NaCl solution.<br>
Results: Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps at approximate right angles<br>
(Figure 75d), grew many small twinned cubes (about 3-4 mm on a side). Beaker #2 (four<br>
overhead sodium lamps at approximately 45° angles from horizontal and substantially equally<br>
spaced from each other (Figure 75e), grew many small twinned cubes (about 4-5 mm on a<br>
side) and a few twinned crystals. The control maintained in total darkness showed no<br>
growth. The spectral solution exhibited increased nucleation.<br>
Twinned cubic crystals from Beakers 1 and 2 were removed and placed in fresh<br>
spectral, saturated, filtered NaCl solution in the shielded room with the same spectral cone<br>
crystallization overnight.<br>
Results: Crystals in both Beakers #1 and #2 grew pyramidal corners and rims onto<br>
the twinned cubes with substantially increased primary nucleation.<br><br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control phase changes,<br>
structure, and material properties in solid and liquid materials.<br>
Example 16<br>
Classical saturated NaCl solution was both prepared and stored in the dark. Beakers<br>
with 100 ml filtered solution were placed into the dark, shielded room with the following setup:<br>
1) four horizontal sodium lamps with cones at approximate right angles (Figure 75d); 2)<br>
four overhead sodium lamps with cones at about 45° angles (Figure 75e); 3) on a table about<br>
8 feet from the sodium lamps; and 4) in an aluminum foil-covered bucket. Crystallization<br>
proceeded overnight (about 20 hours) with no ambient light present.<br>
Results: - Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps), "Figure 75d, grew many<br>
twinned cubes (about 3-4 mm), pyramids, rods, twinned crystals, and a cubic corner, with a<br>
total weight of 6.1 grams. Beaker #2 (four sodium lamps at about 45°), Figure 75e, grew<br>
twinned cubes and crystals (about 4-5 mm on a side), and a large twinned crystal (about 18 x<br>
11 mm) with a total weight of about 9.5 grams. Beaker #3 (i.e., on the table 8 feet away)<br>
grew many small (about 1 mm) crystals, with a total weight of about 2.7 grams. Beaker #4<br>
(aluminum foil-covered bucket) grew about 0.2 grams of very small crystals (less than about<br>
1 mm).<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control phase changes,<br>
structure, and material properties in solid and liquid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
The experimental procedure was identical to the experimental procedure of Example<br>
14, except that a spectral NaCl solution prepared in the dark was used.<br>
Results: Beaker #1 (four horizontal sodium lamps), Figure 75d, grew many (greater<br>
than 50) small cubes (about 2-4 mm on a side). Beaker #2 (four sodium lamps oriented at<br>
about 45°), Figure 75e, grew fewer (approximately 30) but larger cubes (about 5-7 mm on a<br>
side) and pyramids. The crystals in both Beakers #1 and #2 were growing above a layer of<br>
more than 100 sandy consistency crystals. The control, maintained in total darkness in the<br>
aluminum foil-wrapped bucket, showed no crystallization. The crystals grown from the<br>
spectral solutions appear to produce many more nucleations and this solution preparation<br>
technique should be applicable when a polycrystalline phase or thin film may be useful.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to control phase changes,<br>
structure, and material properties in solid and liquid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
A spectral NaCl solution was prepared and filtered and about 50 ml of solution was<br>
placed into each of five different sized beakers #'s 1-5 as follows: 1) 50 ml beaker; 2) 150 ml<br>
beaker; 3) 250 ml beaker; 4) 400 ml beaker; and 5) 600 ml beaker. About 50 ml of solution<br>
was also placed into each of control Beakers #'s 6-10 as follows: 6) 50 ml beaker: 7) 150 ml<br>
beaker; 8) 250 ml beaker; 9) 400 ml beaker; and 10) 600 ml beaker. Beakers #'sl-5 were<br>
placed under overhead sodium lamps 112 with cone delivery configuration 120, as shown in<br>
Figure 94. Beakers #'s 6-10 were placed in a cabinet with the doors covered with aluminum<br>
foil to block light from entering into the cabinet. Crystallization proceeded overnight (about<br>
16 hours) with no ambient light present.<br>
Results, For the spectral crystallizations, the following results were achieved:<br>
1) approximately 25 cubes (about 1.5-2 mm); 2) approximately 12 cubes (about 3-5 mm);<br>
3) approximately 25 cubes (about 3-6 mm); 4) approximately 20 cubes (up to about 9 mm);<br>
5) approximately 25 cubes (about 3-6 mm).<br>
For the controls, the following results were achieved: 6) approximately 15 cubes<br>
(most about 1 mm); 7) approximately 10 cubes (about 1.5 mm); 8) approximately 4 cubes<br>
(about 3 mm) and a rod (about 1.5 x 9 mm); 9) approximately 8 cubes (about 2-4 mm);<br>
10) approximately 12 cubes (about 3-6 mm). Thus, with the same solution and amount and<br>
crystallization process, crystal yields and growth are affected by the size and/or shape of the<br>
beaker (e.g., container or reaction vessel effects).<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect phase changes, material<br>
properties, and structure in solid and liquid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>
Classical NaCl solution prepared in the dark was filtered and about 100 ml placed into<br>
three separate beakers (about 600 ml in size) in the dark, shielded room. Beaker #1 was<br>
illuminated by two horizontal sodium lamps and one overhead sodium lamp (Figure 75c).<br>
Beaker #2 was illuminated by one horizontal lamp, one overhead lamp at about 90 degrees to<br>
the horizontal lamp, and one lamp at about 45 degrees between the horizontal and overhead<br>
lamps (Figure 75g). The control Beaker #3 was placed in an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket.<br>
Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 20 hours) with no ambient light present.<br>
Results: The control in the aluminum, foil-wrapped bucket showed no crystallization.<br>
Beaker #1 (2 horizontal/1 overhead; Figure 75c) grew more than 50 cubes (2 about 4 mm)<br>
and approximately 10 rods (about 3-11 mm in length). Beaker #2 (horizontal, 45 degrees,<br>
overhead; Figure 75g) grew approximately 15 cubes (about 5-12 mm) many of which were<br>
twinned and/or hoppers, a few rods (up to about 22 x 2 mm) and two polycrystalline clusters.<br>
Thus, it appears that direction and orientation of the spectral input during crystallization<br>
affects crystal growth and morphology.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect phase changes,<br>
structure, and material properties of solid and liquid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
Water in its original clear plastic packaging was conditioned overnight (about 19<br>
hours) by irradiation with a sodium lamp. Classic NaCl solution was prepared using the<br>
conditioned water under ambient fluorescent lighting. The saturated classic solution was<br>
filtered and about 100 ml was placed into three beakers (about 600 ml in size) in a dark,<br>
shielded room at about 24°C. Beaker #1 was illuminated by two horizontal sodium lamps<br>
and one overhead sodium lamp (Figure 75c). Beaker #2 was illuminated by one horizontal<br>
lamp, one overhead lamp at about 90 degrees to the horizontal lamp, and one lamp at about<br>
45 degrees between the horizontal and overhead lamp (Figure 75g). The control Beaker #3<br>
was placed in an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket. Crystallization proceeded with no ambient<br>
light for Beakers 1-3.<br>
Results: The control in the aluminum foil-wrapped bucket showed a few pinpoints<br>
of crystallization (too little to collect and weigh). Beaker #1 (two horizontal/one overhead;<br>
Figure 75c) grew hundreds of small cubic (about 1.5 mm) crystals and some small rods,<br>
about 5.9 grams. Beaker #1 fluid level was about 90 ml and the solution temperature was<br>
about 27°C. Beaker #2 (horizontal, 45 degrees, overhead; Figure 75g) grew hundreds of<br>
small cubic (about 1.5 mm) crystals with some rods, total weight about 5.6 grams. The<br>
solution level was approximately 80 ml and the solution temperature was about 27°C. Thus,<br>
solutions prepared classically from irradiated water showed an increase in nucleation.<br>
In this Example, water was conditioned with a spectral conditioning pattern and a<br>
spectral pattern (both comprising sodium lamp) and crystal growth was affected relative to<br>
the control.<br>
EXAMPLE 21<br>
Classical NaCl solution, prepared under ambient fluorescent lights and stored in<br>
aluminum foil, was filtered and about 100 ml was placed into two beakers (about 600 ml in<br><br>
size) in a shielded, dark room at about 25°C. Beaker #1 was placed under an overhead<br>
sodium lamp with cone (Figure 72), and Beaker #2 was placed into an aluminum foil-<br>
wrapped bucket. Classic NaCl solution, prepared with sodium lamp-conditioned water under<br>
ambient fluorescent lights and stored in aluminum foil, was also filtered and about 100 ml<br>
was placed into two beakers (about 600 ml in size) in a shielded room at about 24°C. Beaker<br>
#3 was placed under an overhead sodium lamp with cone (Figure 72). and Beaker #4 was<br>
placed into an aluminum foil-wrapped bucket. Crystallization proceeded overnight (about 21<br>
hours) with no ambient light present<br>
Results: Beaker #1 with classic solution grew about 7.0 grams total of about 1 mm<br>
cubic crystals. Beaker #3 with conditioned water solution grew about 6.2 grams total of<br>
about 1.5 mm crystals. Control Beakers #2 and #4 had essentially no growth.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect phase changes,<br>
structure, and material properties of solid and liquid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
The procedure in Example 21 was repeated. Results were similar.<br>
Results: Beaker #1 with classic solution grew about 2.5 grams of about 1 mm cubic<br>
crystals. Beaker #3 with conditioned water solution grew about 2.3 grams of about 1.5 mm<br>
crystals. Control Beakers #2 and #4 had essentially no growth. Both solutions crystallized<br>
the same weight of NaCl, but the crystals from the irradiated water solution were larger (and<br>
hence fewer in number). Thus, it appears that sodium spectral conditioning of water prior to<br>
preparing classical saturated NaCl solutions affects subsequent crystal size and nucleation.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect phase change,<br>
structure, and material properties of solid and liquid materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 23<br>
Classical NaCl solution stored in aluminum foil was filtered and about 100 ml was<br>
placed into Beakers #1 and #2 (about 600 ml in size). Classical NaCl solution stored<br>
wrapped in a black plastic bag was filtered and about 100 ml was placed into Beakers #3 and<br>
#4 (about 600 ml in size). Classical NaCl solution stored wrapped in clear plastic was<br>
filtered and about 100 ml was placed into Beakers #5 and #6 (about 600 ml in size). Beakers<br>
#1, #3, and #5 were placed under an overhead sodium lamp with cone Figure 72). Control<br>
Beakers #2, #4, and #6 were placed in a light-tight cabinet. Crystallization proceeded<br>
overnight (about 20 hours) with no ambient light present.<br><br>
Results:<br>
1. (foil, sodium lamp) - about 1 mm crystals, about 0.8 grams total weight<br>
2. (foil, control) - no growth<br>
3. (black plastic, sodium lamp) - about 3-7 mm cubic crystals, some twinning, about<br>
1.2 grams total weight<br>
4. (black plastic, control) - less than 0.4 mm crystals, about 0.25 grams total weight<br>
5. (clear plastic, sodium lamp) - about 3-4 mm cubic crystals, no twinning, about 1.7<br>
grams total weight<br>
6. (clear plastic, control) - about 1.5 mm crystals, about 0.38 g total weight<br>
Thus, aluminum foil coverings on the outside of the Pyrex beaker during storage conditioned<br>
the saturated solution and inhibited subsequent NaCl crystal nucleation and growth.<br>
Solutions exposed to ambient light during solution equilibration overnight have more crystal<br>
growth by weight. Accordingly, it appears that storage containers and/or spectral conditions<br>
and/or conditioning of solutions preparation before, during, and after affect subsequent<br>
crystallization from solutions.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies and environmental reaction conditions<br>
were used to affect phase changes in solid and liquid materials.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE<br>
EXAMPLE 24a<br>
Figure 76 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to generate baseline<br>
measured pH information at about 55°C as a function of time. In this Example 24a, the<br>
Bunsen burner 101 was supplied with propane fuel from the fuel source 100 via a flexible<br>
rubber tube 115. The flame from the Bunsen burner 101 was caused to be incident upon a<br>
cast iron hot plate 103 which was attached to a ring stand 102. A 1000 ml Pyrex<br>
cylindrical beaker 104 was placed on top of the cast iron hot plate 103. The beaker 104<br>
contained approximately 800 ml of distilled water obtained from American Fare. An AR20<br>
pH/mV/ºc/Conductivity meter 107 from Accumet Research communicated with the 800 ml<br>
of distilled water and later with the solution 105 through a temperature probe 108 and a pH<br>
electrode 109. More details of the pH electrode can be seen ir. Figure 79. The pH meter was<br>
elevated to a convenient height by the use of a support structure 106.<br>
The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured at room<br>
temperature and then heated to about 55°C in about 15-20 minutes by use of the Bunsen<br>
burner heating the hot plate 103 and the hot plate 103 radiating its conditioning energy to the<br>
beaker 104 containing the distilled water. The water temperature was monitored by the<br>
Accumet meter 107. Once a temperature of about 55°C was obtained, about 50 grams of<br>
sodium chloride (certified A. C. S. and as discussed above herein), were added to the 800 ml<br>
of distilled water in the beaker 104 to form the solution 105. The sodium chloride was stirred<br>
into the 800 ml of distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and complete dissolution of the<br>
sodium chloride occurred within about 30-45 seconds. The temperature, of the solution 105<br>
was reduced by approximately 1/2 to 1°C, but was quickly brought back to about 55°C by the<br>
Bunsen burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter of a few seconds. The electrodes<br>
108 and 109 were temporarily removed from the solution 105 to permit the stilling, mixing<br>
and dissolution of the sodium chloride into the distilled water. However, the electrodes 10S<br>
and 109 were immediately reinserted into the solution 105 upon completion of the stirring.<br>
Figure 80a shows the results of three (3) separate experiments corresponding to the<br>
experimental apparatus of Figure 76. The plotted data show the change in measured pH of the solution 105 as a function of time at a temperature of about 55ºC. In particular, the pH of<br>
the distilled water alone was first measured at room temperature and then measured at about<br>
55°C, and thereafter the pH of the solution 105 was measured about every two minutes after<br>
the addition and dissolution of sodium chloride. The time measurements were all at intervals<br>
of about two minutes with a final measurement after about 40 minutes.<br>
 The AR20 meter 107, which used the pH electrode 109 (the electrode being shown in<br>
more detail in Figure 79), were together calibrated by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/- 0.01 at 25"C, and was a solution of potassium<br>
bipthalate. A second buffer solution had a pH of 7.00 +/- 0.01 at 25°C, and was a solution of<br>
potassium phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide. Both solutions were 0.05 Molar, both<br>
were certified and both were obtained from Fisher Chemicals. The use of these buffer<br>
solutions was intended to insure accuracy of the readings from the pH electrode.<br>
All experimental conditions described in the Example occurred in the presence of<br>
standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe<br>
Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts and were each eight (8) feet (about 2.4 meters) long. The lamps<br>
were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above the laboratory counter on which the<br>
experimental set-up was located. There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a room which<br>
measured approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (about 7.6 meters x 12.1 meters).<br>
EXAMPLE 24b<br>
Figure 77 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to generate measured pH<br>
information at about 55°C as a function of time. In this Example 24b, the Bunsen burner 101<br>
was supplied with propane fuel from the fuel source 100 via a flexible rubber tube 115. The<br>
flame from the Bunsen burner 101 was caused to be incident upon a cast iron hot plate 103<br>
which was attached to a ring stand 102. A 1000 ml Pyrex™ cylindrical beaker 104 was<br>
placed on top of the cast iron hot plate 103. The beaker 104 contained approximately 800 ml<br>
of distilled water obtained from American Fare. An AR20 pH/mV/ºC/Conductivity meter<br>
107 from Accumet Research communicated with the 800 ml of distilled water and later with<br>
the solution 105 through a temperature probe 108 and a pH electrode 109. More details of<br>
the pH electrode can be seen in Figure 79. The pH meter was elevated to a convenient height<br>
by the use of a support structure 106.<br>
The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured at room<br>
temperature and then heated to about 55°C in about 15-20 minutes by use of the Bunsen<br>
burner heating the hot plate 103. The water temperature was monitored by the Accumet<br>
meter 107. Once a temperature of about 55°C was obtained, about 50 grams of sodium<br>
chloride (certified A. C. S. and discussed above herein), were added to the 800 ml of distilled<br>
water in the beaker 104 to form the solution 105. The sodium chloride was stirred into the<br>
800 ml of distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and complete dissolution of the sodium<br>
chloride occurred within about 30-45 seconds. The temperature of the solution 105 was<br>
reduced by approximately 1/2 to 1°C, but was quickly brought back to about 55ºC by the<br>
Bunsen burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter of a few seconds. The electrodes<br>
108 and 109 were temporarily removed from the solution 105 to permit the stirring, mixing<br>
and dissolution of the sodium chloride into the distilled water. However, the electrodes 108<br>
and 109 were immediately reinserted upon completion of the stirring.<br>
A ring stand 113 was positioned adjacent to the ring stand 102 such that a high<br>
pressure sodium light 112 contained within a housing 111, and surrounded by an aluminum<br>
foil tube 110 permitted light emitted from the bulb 112 to be transmitted through the<br>
aluminum foil tube 110 and become incident upon a side of the beaker 104. The ring stand<br>
113 was positioned such that the end of the aluminum tube 110 adjacent to the side of the<br>
beaker 104 was about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch away from the side of the beaker 104. The tube<br>
110 measured about eight (8) inches long and was about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. The top<br>
end of the sodium light bulb 112 was about five (5) inches from the end of the tube 110. In<br>
this Example 24b, the sodium light bulb 112 was actuated at about the same time that the<br>
electrodes 108 and 109 were reinserted into the solution 105 which is after the sodium<br>
chloride had been mixed into and dissolved in the distilled water. The light fixture 111 was<br>
fixed to the ring stand 113 by use of a chain clamp 114.<br>
Figure 80b shows the results of three (3) separate experiments corresponding to the<br>
experimental apparatus of Figure 77. The plotted data show the change in measured pH of<br>
the solution 105 as a function of time at a temperature of about 55 ºC. In particular, the pH of<br>
the distilled water alone was first measured at room temperature and then measured at about<br>
55°C, and thereafter measured about every two minutes after the addition and dissolution of<br>
sodium chloride and the activation of the high pressure sodium light 112. The time<br>
measurements were all at intervals of about two minutes.<br>
The AR20 meter 107, which used the pH electrode 109 (the electrode being shown in<br>
more detail in Figure 79) were together calibrated by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/- 0.01 at about 25°C, and was a solution of<br>
potassium bipthalate. A second buffer solution had a pH of 7.00 +/- 0.01 at about 25°C, and<br>
was a solution of potassium phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide. Both solutions were<br>
0.05 Molar, both were certified and both were obtained from Fisher Chemicals. The use of<br>
these buffer solutions was intended to insure accuracy of the pH readings from the pH<br>
electrode.<br>
All experimental conditions described in the Example occurred in the presence of<br>
standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe<br>
Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts and were each about eight (8) feet (about 2.4 meters) long. The<br>
lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above the laboratory counter on<br>
which the experimental set-up was located. There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a<br>
room which measured approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (about 7.6 meters x 12.1 meters).<br>
EXAMPLE 24c<br>
Figure 78 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to generate measured pH<br>
information where the temperature of the distilled water in the beaker 104, and later in the<br>
solution 105, in the beaker 104 was heated exclusively by use of a high pressure sodium bulb<br>
112 contained in a fixture 111.<br>
This Example 24c differs from the previous Examples 24a and 24b in that no Bunsen<br>
burner was provided for heating. In this regard, the only heat that was generated from the<br>
energy emitted by the combination of the high pressure sodium bulb 112, and the fixture 111.<br>
In particular, the energy was transmitted to the bottom of the beaker 104 initially containing<br>
the distilled water, and later to the solution 105, through the use of the aluminum foil tube<br>
110. Specifically, the ring stand 102 supported the beaker 104 by the use of the chain clamp<br>
114. The beaker 104 was initially lowered into the aluminum foil tube 110 such that<br>
approximately 150-200 ml of the distilled water contained in the beaker 104 was physically<br>
located inside of the aluminum foil tube 110. The tube 110 measured about seven (7) inches<br>
long and was about four (4) inches in diameter. The top end of the sodium light bulb 112 was<br>
about four (4) inches from the end of the tube 110. Once the distilled water temperature<br>
achieved about 55°C after about 11/4-1 1/2 hours, the sodium chloride was added, as<br>
discussed above. The chain clamp 114 was then raised vertically slightly upon the ring stand<br>
102 so that the bottom of the beaker 104 was now positioned slightly outside of the aluminum<br>
foil tube 110 (as shown in Figure 78). Experience caused (he precise final location of the<br>
bottom of the beaker 104 to be about 1/2 inch - 3/4 inch above the end of the aluminum foil<br>
tube 110. The primary difference between this Example 24c and the previous two Examples<br>
24a and 24b is that the only energy provided to the distilled water and the solution 105 came<br>
from the combination of the sodium bulb 112 and the fixture 111.<br>
Figure 80c shows the results of three (3) separate experiments corresponding to the<br>
experimental apparatus of Figure 78. The plotted data show the change in measured pH of<br>
the solution 105 as a function of time at a temperature of about 55°C. In particular, the pH of<br>
the distilled water alone was first measured at room temperature and then measured at about<br>
55°C, and thereafter the pH of the solution 105 was measured about every two minutes after<br>
the addition and dissolution of sodium chloride. The time measurements were all at intervals<br>
of about two minutes.<br>
The AR20 meter 107, which used the pH electrode 109 (the electrode being shown in<br>
more detail in Figure 79) were together calibrated by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/- 0.01 at about 25ºC, and was a solution of<br>
potassium bipthalate. A second buffer solution had a pH of 7.00 +/- 0.01 at about 25°C, and<br>
was a solution of potassium phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide. Both solutions were<br>
0.05 Molar, both were certified and both were obtained from Fisher Chemicals. The use of<br>
these buffer solutions was intended to insure accuracy of the pH readings from the pH<br>
electrode.<br>
All experimental conditions described in the Example occurred in the presence of<br>
standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe<br>
Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts and were each about eight (8) feet (about 2.4 meters) long. The<br>
lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 meters above the laboratory counter on<br>
which the experimental set-up was located. There were six (6) of lamps present in a room<br>
which measured approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (about 7.6 meters x 12.1 meters).<br>
EXAMPLE 24d<br>
Figure 71 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to generate measured pH<br>
information at about 55°C as a function of time. In this Example 24d, a ring stand 113 was<br>
positioned adjacent to the ring stand 102 such that a high pressure sodium light 112 contained<br>
within a housing 111, and surrounded by an aluminum foil tube 110 permitted light emitted<br>
from the bulb 112 to be transmitted through the aluminum foil tube 110 and become incident<br>
upon a side of the beaker 104. The ring stand 113 was positioned such that the end of the<br>
aluminum tube 110 adjacent to the side of the beaker 104 was about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch<br>
(about 2.0 cm to about 2.5 cm) away from the side of the beaker 104. The tube 110 measured<br>
about eight (8) inches (about 2.4 meters) long and was about 3 1/2 inches (about 8.5 cm) in<br>
diameter. The top end of the sodium light bulb 112 was about five (5) inches (about 12.5 cm)<br>
from the end of the tube 110. In this Example 24d, the sodium light bulb 112 was actuated<br>
about 40 minutes before heating the water with the Bunsen burner and irradiated the solution<br>
continuously throughout the pH measurements. The light fixture 111 was fixed to the ring<br>
stand 113 by use of a chain clamp 114.<br>
The Bunsen burner 101 was supplied with propane fuel from the fuel source 100 via a<br>
flexible rubber tube 115. The flame from the Bunsen burner 101 was caused to be incident<br>
upon a cast iron hot plate 103 which was attached to a ring stand 102. A 1000 ml Pyrex™<br>
cylindrical beaker 104 was placed on top of the cast iron hot plate 103. The beaker 104<br>
contained approximately 800 ml of distilled water obtained from American Fare. An AR20<br>
pH/mVrC/Conductivity meter 107 from Accumet Research communicated with the 800 ml<br>
of distilled water and later with the solution 105 through a temperature probe 108 and a pH<br>
electrode 109. More details of the pH electrode can be seen in Figure 79. The pH meter was<br>
elevated to a convenient height by the use of a support structure 106.<br>
The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured at room<br>
temperature before actuating the sodium lamp. After the 40 minute Na lamp conditioning,<br>
the water was then heated to about 55°C in about 15-20 minutes by use of the Bunsen burner<br>
heating the hot plate 103. The water temperature was monitored by the Accumet meter 107.<br>
Once a temperature of about 55 °C was obtained, about 50 grams of sodium chloride (certified<br>
A. C. S. and discussed above herein), were added to the 800 ml of distilled water in the<br>
beaker 104 to form the solution 105. The sodium chloride was stirred into the 800 ml of<br>
distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and complete dissolution of the sodium chloride<br>
occurred within about 30-45 seconds. The temperature of the solution 105 was reduced by<br>
approximately 1/2 to 1ºC, but was quickly brought back to about 55°C by the Bunsen burner<br>
101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter of a few seconds. The electrodes 108 and 109<br>
were temporarily removed from the solution 105 to permit the stirring, mixing and<br>
dissolution of the sodium chloride, into the distilled water. However, the electrodes 108 and<br>
109 were immediately reinserted upon completion of the stirring.<br>
Figure 80e shows the results of three (3) separate experiments corresponding to the<br>
experimental apparatus of Figure 77. The plotted data show the change in measured pH of<br>
the solution 105 as a function of time at a temperature of about 55°C. In particular, the pH of<br>
the distilled water alone was first measured at room temperature and then measured at about<br>
55°C, and thereafter measured about every two minutes after the addition and dissolution of<br>
sodium chloride and the activation of the high pressure sodium light 112. The time<br>
measurements were all at intervals of about two minutes.<br>
The AR20 meter 107, which used the pH electrode 109 (the electrode being shown in<br>
more detail in Figure 79) were together calibrated by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/- 0.01 at about 25ºC, and was a solution of<br>
potassium bipthalate. A second buffer solution had a pH of 7.00 +/- 0.01 at about 25°C, and<br>
was a solution of potassium phosphate monobasic-sodium hydroxide. Both solutions were<br>
0.05 Molar, both were certified and both were obtained from Fisher Chemicals. The use of<br>
these buffer solutions was intended to insure accuracy of the pH readings from the pH<br>
electrode.<br>
All experimental conditions described in the Example occurred in the presence of<br>
standard fluorescent lighting. The fluorescent lamps were Sylvania Cool White Deluxe<br>
Fluorescent Lamps, 75 watts and were each about eight (8) feet (about 2.4 meters) long. The<br>
lamps were suspended in pairs approximately 3.5 feet above the laboratory counter on which<br>
the experimental set-up was located. There were six (6) pairs of lamps present in a room<br>
which measured approximately 25 feet by 40 feet (about 2.6 meters x 12.1 meters).<br>
EXAMPLE 24e<br>
Figure 77 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to generate measured pH<br>
information at about 55°C as a function of time. In this Example 24e, a ring stand 113 was<br>
positioned adjacent to the ring stand 102 such that a high pressure sodium light 112 contained<br>
within a housing 111, and surrounded by an aluminum foil tube 110 permitted light emitted<br>
from the bulb 112 to be transmitted through the aluminum foil tube 110 and become incident<br>
upon a side of the beaker 104. The ring stand 113 was positioned such that the end of the<br>
aluminum tube 110 adjacent to the side of the beaker 104 was about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch<br>
(about 2.0 cm to about 2.5 cm) away from the side of the beaker 104. The tube 110 measured<br>
about eight (8) inches (about 2.4 cm) long and was about 3 1/2 inches (about 8.5 cm) in<br>
diameter. The top end of the sodium light bulb 112 was about five (5) inches (about 12.5 cm)<br>
from the end of the tube 110. In this Example 24e, the sodium light bulb 112 was actuated about 40 minutes and then terminated, before heating the water with the Bunsen burner. The<br>
light fixture 111 was fixed to the ring stand 113 by use of a chain clamp 114.<br>
The Bunsen burner 101 was supplied with propane fuel from the fuel source 100 via a<br>
flexible rubber tube 115. The flame from the Bunsen burner 101 was caused to be incident<br>
upon a cast iron hot plate 103 which was attached to a ring stand 102. A 1000 ml Pyrex™ cylindrical beaker 104 was placed on top of the cast iron hot plate 103. The beaker 104<br>

electrode 109. More details of the pH electrode can be seen in Figure 79. The pH meter was elevated to a convenient height by the use of a support structure 106.<br>
The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured at room<br>
temperature, before actuating the sodium lamp conditioning. After the 40 minutes of sodium<br>
lamp conditioning of the water, the water was then heated to about 55°C in about 15-20<br>
minutes by use of the Bunsen burner heating the hot plate 103. The water temperature was monitored by the Accumet meter 107. Once a temperature of about 55°C was obtained, about<br>
50 grams of sodium chloride (certified A. C. S. and discussed above herein), were added to<br>
the 800 ml of distilled water in the beaker 104 to form the solution 105. The sodium chloride<br>
was stirred into the 800 ml of distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and complete<br>
dissolution of the sodium chloride occurred within about 30-45 seconds. The temperature of<br>
the solution 105 was reduced by approximately 1/2 to 1°C, but was quickly brought back to<br>
about 55°C by the Bunsen burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter of a few seconds.<br>
The electrodes 108 and 109 were temporarily removed from the solution 105 to permit the<br>
stirring, mixing and dissolution of the sodium chloride into the distilled water. However, the<br>
electrodes 108 and 109 were immediately reinserted upon completion of the stirring.<br>
Figure 80f shows the results of three (3) separate experiments corresponding to the<br>
experimental apparatus of Figure 77. The plotted data show the change in measured pH of<br>
the solution 105 as a function of time at a temperature of about 55°C. In particular, the pH of<br><br>
the distilled water alone was first measured at room temperature and then measured at about<br>
55°C, and thereafter measured about every two minutes after the addition and dissolution of<br>

more detail in Figure 79) were together calibrated by using two different buffer solutions.<br>
The first buffer solution had a pH of 4.00 +/- 0.01 at about 25°C, and was a solution of<br>

EXAMPLE 24f<br>
Figure 77 is a schematic of the experimental apparatus used to generate measured pH<br>
information at about 55°C as a function of time. In this Example 24f, a ring stand 113 was<br>
positioned adjacent to the ring stand 102 such that a high pressure sodium light 112 contained<br>
within a housing 111, and surrounded by an aluminum foil tube 110 permitted light emitted<br>
from the bulb 112 to be transmitted through the aluminum foil tube 110 and become incident<br>
upon a side of the beaker 104. The ring stand 113 was positioned such that the end of the<br>
aluminum tube 110 adjacent to the side of the beaker 104 was about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch<br>
(about 1 cm to about 1.5 cm) away from the side of the beaker 104. The tube 110 measured<br>
about eight (8) inches long (about 20 cm) and was about 3 1/2 inches (about 8.5 cm) in<br>
diameter. The top end of the sodium light bulb 112 was about five (5) inches (about 12.5 cm)<br>
from the end of the tube 110. In this Example 28f, the sodium light bulb 112 was actuated<br>
about 40 minutes, terminated, and pH was measured. The light fixture 111 was fixed to the<br>
ring stand 113 by use of a chain clamp 114.<br>
The Bunsen burner 101 was supplied with propane fuel from the fuel source 100 via a<br>
flexible rubber tube 115. The flame from the Bunsen burner 101 was caused to be incident<br>
upon a cast iron hot plate 103 which was attached to a ring stand 102. A 1000 ml Pyrex™<br>
cylindrical beaker 104 was placed on top of the cast iron hot plate 103. The beaker 104<br>
contained approximately 800 ml of distilled water obtained from American Fare. An AR20<br>
pH/mV/°C/Conductivity meter 107 from Accumet Research communicated with the 800 ml<br>
of distilled water and later with the solution 105 through a temperature probe 108 and a pH<br>
electrode 109. More details of the pH electrode can be seen in Figure 79. The pH meter was<br>
elevated to a convenient height by the use of a support structure 106.<br>
The pH of the distilled water in the beaker 104 was first measured at room<br>
temperature, before actuating the sodium lamp conditioning. After the 40 minutes sodium<br>
lamp conditioning of the water, the following time intervals elapsed before heating the water<br>
to 55°C with the Bunsen burner: 1) 0 minutes; 2) 20 minutes; 3) 40 minutes; 4) 60 minutes;<br>
and 5) 120 minutes. The water was then heated to about 55ºC in about 5 minutes by use of<br>
the Bunsen burner heating the hot plate 103. The water temperature was monitored by the<br>
Accumet meter 107. Once a temperature of about 55°C was obtained, about 50 grams of<br>
sodium chloride (certified A. C. S. and discussed above herein), were added to the 800 ml of<br>
distilled water in the beaker 104 to form the solution 105. The sodium chloride was stirred<br>
into the 800 ml of distilled water by use of glass stirring rod and complete dissolution of the<br>
sodium chloride occurred within about 30-45 seconds. The temperature of the solution 105<br>
was reduced by approximately 1/2 to 1°C, but was quickly brought back to about 55°C by the<br>
Bunsen burner 101 and cast iron hot plate 103 in a matter of a few seconds. The electrodes<br>
108 and 109 were temporarily removed from the solution 105 to permit the stirring, mixing<br>
and dissolution of the sodium chloride into the distilled water. However, the electrodes 108<br>
and 109 were immediately reinserted upon completion of the stirring.<br>
Figure SOh shows the results of three (3) separate experiments (#'s 3, 4, and 5)<br>
corresponding to the experimental apparatus of Figure 77, representing decay curves for the<br>
Na lamp conditioning effect in water. The plotted data show the change in measured pH of<br>
the solution 105 as a function of time at a temperature of about 55°C. In particular, the pH of<br>
the distilled water alone was first measured at room temperature and then measured when the<br>
sodium lamp was terminated, and thereafter measured about every two minutes after the<br>
addition and dissolution of sodium chloride. The time measurements were all at intervals of<br>
about two (2) minutes for 20 minutes, with a final measurement at about 40 minutes.<br>

DISCUSSION OF EXAMPLES 24a. 24h. 24c. 24d. 24e and 24f<br>
Figure 80d shows the averages calculated from the data from each of the three (3)<br>
series of experiments from each of Examples 24a, 24b and 24c. The data show that the<br>
Bunsen burner- only heating corresponding to Example. 24a and Figure 76 had the smallest<br>
overall measured rise in pH after a period of time of approximately 4-6 minutes. The data<br>
generated from Example 24b, and corresponding to Figure 77, showed an intermediate rise in<br>
measured pH with time after about 4-6 minutes. In Example 24b, the sodium spectral pattern<br>
was added only at the point when the solution 105 had attained a temperature of about 55 ºC.<br>
The greatest overall increase in measured pH from a time of about 2-40 minutes was<br>
shown in the data corresponding to Example 24c, which corresponds to the experimental<br>
apparatus shown in Figure 78. In this Example 24c, the distilled water in the beaker 104, was<br>
exposed to the sodium spectral pattern emitted from the sodium light bulb 112 for the longest<br>
amount of time (e.g., energy was provided to the distilled water and the solution 105<br>
exclusively through the combination of the sodium light bulb 112 and the fixture 111) which<br>
was about 1 1/4-1 1/2 hours to heat the water to about 55°C end then for an additional 40<br>
minutes while the pH measurements were made.<br>
Accordingly, the data shown in Figure 80d clearly show the effect of a sodium<br>
spectral pattern upon the measured pH of the sodium chloride/water solution 105, as<br>
measured by an AR20 meter from Accumet Research used in combination with a pH<br>
electrode 109 (as shown in more detail in Figure 79).<br>
Figure 80g shows the averages calculated from the data from each of the three (3)<br>
series of experiments from each of Examples 24a, 24b and 24e. The data show that the<br>
Bunsen burner-only heating corresponding to Example 24a and Figure 76 had the smallest<br>
overall measured rise in pH after a period of time of approximately 4-6 minutes. The data<br>
generated from Example 24b, and corresponding to Figure 77, showed an intermediate rise in<br>
measured pH with time after about 4-6 minutes. In Example 24e, the water was conditioned<br>
by the sodium spectral pattern, after which it was heated to 55°C and the NaCl was added and<br>
dissolved.<br>
The greatest overall increase in measured pH from a time of about 2-40 minutes was<br>
shown in the data corresponding to Example 24e, which corresponds to the experimental<br>
apparatus shown in Figure 77. In this Example 24e, the distilled water in the beaker 104, was<br>
exposed to the conditioning sodium spectral pattern emitted from the sodium light bulb 112<br>
for about forty (40) minutes (e.g., conditioning energy was provided to the distilled water 105<br>
exclusively with the sodium light bulb 112 for about 40 minutes).<br>
Accordingly, the data shown in Figure 80g clearly show the pH effect of a<br>
conditioning sodium spectral pattern upon distilled water, which is later used to make a<br>
sodium chloride/water solution 105, as measured by an AR20 meter from Accumet Research<br>
used in combination with a pH electrode 109 (as shown in more detail in Figure 79).<br>
Figure 80h shows the experimental data from each of the three (3) experiments from<br>
Example 24f3, 24f4, and 24f5. The data (24f5) show that the 120 minute interval between<br>
conditioning of the distilled water and dissolution of the NaCl salt had the smallest overall<br>
measured rise in pH after a period of time of approximately 40 minutes. The data generated<br>
from Example 24f4, after about a 60 minute interval between conditioning of the distilled<br>
water and dissolution of the NaCl salt, showed an intermediate rise in measured pH with time<br>
after about 40 minutes. In Example 24f3, the water was conditioned by the sodium spectral<br>
pattern, and the interval between conditioning and dissolution of the NaCl salt was only about<br>
40 minutes. Example 24f3 showed the greatest rise in pH.<br>
Accordingly, the data shown in Figure 80h clearly show a time-related decay effect of<br>
a conditioning sodium spectral pattern upon distilled water, which is later used to make a<br>
sodium chloride/water solution 105, as measured by an AR20 meter from Accumet Research<br>
used in combination with a pH electrode 109 (as shown in more detail in Figure 79). The<br>
conditioning effects of a sodium spectral pattern upon distilled water remained in the water<br>
for a period of time approximately equal to the conditioning time. After an interval of 1.5<br>
times the conditioning time, the conditioning effects of a sodium spectral pattern upon<br>
distilled water were beginning to decline. Finally, after an interval of 3.0 times the<br>
conditioning time, the conditioning effects of a sodium spectral pattern upon distilled water<br>
declined still further.<br>
Figure 80i shows the experimental data from each of the three (3) experiments from<br>
Example 24f 1 24f2, and 241f3. The data (24f2 and 24f3) shows that the 20 and 40 minute<br>
intervals between conditioning of the distilled water and dissolution of the NaCl salt had the<br>
greatest overall measured rise in pH after a period of time of approximately 40 minutes. The<br>
data generated from Example 24fl, after a zero (0) minute interval between conditioning of<br>
the distilled water, and heating of the water and dissolution of the NaCl salt, showed a lower<br>
rise in measured pH with time after about 40 minutes.<br>
Accordingly, the data shown in Figure 80i clearly show a time-related activation<br>
effect of a conditioning sodium spectral pattern upon distilled water, which is later used to<br>
make a sodium chloride/water solution 105, as measured by an AR20 meter from Accumet<br>
Research used in combination with a pH electrode 109 (as shown in more detail in Figure<br>
79). The conditioning effects of a sodium spectral pattern upon distilled water reach their<br>
peak in the water after a period of time approximately equal to about 0.5-1.0 times the<br>
conditioning time.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to affect phase change in solid<br>
and material properties of a liquid.<br>
EXAMPLE 24g<br>
Changes in pH Due to Effects of Na Lamp Conditioned NaCl on pH<br>
Sodium chloride (about 50 grams) was spread into a thin layer under a sodium lamp<br>
in an otherwise dark room overnight. The next day the salt was used in a pH experiment.<br>
Overhead fluorescent lighting was present continuously throughout both experiments.<br>
Water (about 800 ml) was placed in a 1000 ml beaker and the pH was measured. The water<br>
was next heated to about 55°C and pH was measured again. The water temperature was<br>
maintained at about 55°C for the remainder of the experiment. NaCl (about 50 grams) was<br>
added and stirred with a glass stir rod. Ten additional pH measurements were taken about<br>
every two (2) minutes after the addition of the NaCl, for a total of about 20 minutes. Final<br>
pH was measured about 40 minutes after addition of the NaCl. Figure SOj shows pH as a<br>
function of time for two sets of experiments where sodium chloride solid was conditioned<br>
prior to being dissolved in water.<br>
One series of pH tests was performed on a solution made with the regular salt (which<br>
had not been conditioned), and one series of tests was performed on the solution made with<br>
the conditioned salt.<br>
Results: The pH increased more when the salt had been conditioned with its own Na<br>
spectral energy pattern. This same effect was seen in other similar experiments. When<br>
significantly larger amounts of salt in a much thicker layer were irradiated with the same<br>
intensity, this effect was not nearly so pronounced, or was not seen at all.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used to change the material<br>
properties of a solid upon subsequent phase change into a liquid solution.<br>

Sodium Chloride Solubility in Water at Room Temperature (22° C)<br>
Distilled water (about 500 ml, at about 20°C) was placed into each of six beakers<br>
(each about 1000 ml in size). One Beaker "EE" was placed under a sodium lamp 12, as<br>

in an incubator. Approximately, one hour later, about 500 ml of water was again placed into<br>
two separate beakers. Beaker "CC" was placed under another sodium lamp as Beaker "EE";<br>
and Beaker "DD" was placed into the same incubator as Beaker "FF". The process was<br>
repeated a third time, about one hour later. Specifically, Beaker "AA" was placed under<br>
another sodium lamp as Beakers "EE" and "CC"; and Becker "BB" was placed into the same<br>
incubator as Beaker "FF" and "DD". Thus, the result was three sets of beakers exposed to<br>
the sodium lamp and three sets of beakers in the incubator, one set each for one, two, or three<br>
hours. Water temperatures were as follows:<br>
1) Beaker AA sodium lamp about 1 hour, at about 21°C:<br>
2) Beaker CC sodium lamp about 2 hours, at about 22°C;<br>
3) Beaker EE sodium lamp about 3 hours, at about 23°C;<br>
4) Beaker BB, a control beaker, about 1 hour, at about 21°C;<br>
5) Beaker DD, a control beaker, about 2 hours, at about 22° C; and<br>
6) Beaker FF, a control beaker, about 3 hours, at about 23°C.<br>
Sodium chloride (about 250 grams) was then added to each beaker and stirred. The<br>
beakers were covered with wax paper, placed in a darkened cabinet, and covered with a thick,<br>
black, opaque, light-blocking drape.<br>
Twenty hours later the solutions in the beakers were filtered over their salt into 1000<br>
ml beakers. Two hours later each of the solutions (about 85 ml.) was pipetted into the Kimex<br>
hydrometer testing tube, and temperature and hydrometer measurements were determined.<br>
The solutions were finally pipetted (about 50 ml) into each of five petri dishes, dried, and the<br>
dry sodium chloride weight per 100 ml solution determined.<br>
Results: The rate of NaCl dissolution increased with exposure of the solvent water to<br>
the conditioning sodium lamp, as compared to unconditioned control water. After two hours<br>
exposure to the sodium lamp, the conditioned water dissolved approximately 7 % more NaCl<br>
than the untreated control water. After three hours exposure to the sodium lamp, the<br>
conditioned water dissolved approximately 9% more NaCl than the untreated control water.<br>
The rate of NaCl dissolution also increased with increasing time of exposure to the<br>
sodium lamp from one hour to two hours. After two hours conditioned water dissolved about<br>
3.5% more NaCl than the one hour conditioned water.<br>

EXAMPLE 25b<br>
Sodium Chloride Solubility in Water at Elevated Temperature ("55°C)<br>
Distilled water (about 500 ml, at about 20°C) was placed in each of two beakers 104<br>
as shown in Figure 70 (about 1000 ml) and heated to about 55°C on an iron ringplate 103,<br>
over a Bunsen burner 101. One beaker 105 was then irradiated with a sodium lamp 112 from<br>
the side (as shown in Figure 75a), while the other control water beaker 105 was exposed<br>
simply to the ambient laboratory lighting. One hour later, water was placed into a second set<br>
of beakers 105, which were treated exactly the same as the first set of beakers. The process<br>
was repeated a third time with a third set of beakers 105, one hour later, producing three sets<br>
of beakers, each set having been exposed to the sodium lamp and ambient lighting for one<br>
hour, two hours and three hours. Temperatures were maintained at about 55°C for all three<br>
sets of beakers for the entire time prior to sodium chloride being added thereto.<br>
Specifically, sodium chloride (about 250 grams) was added to each beaker and stirred<br>
after the treatments discussed above occurred. Each of the six the beakers were covered with<br>
wax paper, placed in a darkened cabinet, and covered with a thick, black, opaque, light-<br>
blocking, cloth drape.<br>
Twenty hours later the solutions in the beakers were filtered over their salt into 1000<br>
ml beakers. Each of the solutions (about 85 ml) was pipetted into the Kimex hydrometer<br>
testing tube, and temperature and hydrometer measurements were determined.<br>
Results: Results were virtually identical for all six solutions, which were all fully<br>
saturated. Temperature was about 23.5°C , salinity was about 99.5-100%, specific gravity<br>
was about 1.195 and NaCl percent was about 25.5-26%.<br>
EXAMPLE 25c<br>
Sucrose Solubility in Water at Room Temperature (22° C)<br>
Distilled water (about 500 ml, at about 20°C) was placed in each of six beakers (each<br>
about 1000 ml). One beaker "KK" was placed under a sodium lamp 12, as configured in<br>
Figure 75f, while the other Beaker "LL" functioning as the control was placed in an<br>
incubator. Approximately, one hour later, about 500 ml of water was again placed into the<br>
separate beakers. Beaker "II" was placed under another sodium lamp 12 as like Beaker<br>
"KK"; and Beaker "JJ" was placed in the same incubator as Beaker "LL". The process was<br>
repeated a third time, about one hour later. Specifically, Beaker "GG" was placed under<br>
another sodium lamp 12 as like Beaker "KK" and Beaker "II"; and Becker "HFT was placed<br>
into the same incubator as Beaker "LL" and "II". Thus, the result was three sets of beakers<br>
exposed to three sodium lamps and three sets of beakers in the incubator, one each for one,<br>
two, or three hours.<br>
Sucrose (about 300 grams) was then added to each beaker and stirred. The beakers<br>
were covered with wax paper, placed in a darkened cabinet, and covered with a thick, black,<br>
opaque, light-blocking, cloth drape.<br>
Twenty hours later the solutions in the beakers were filtered over their crystals into<br>
1000 ml beakers. Each of the solutions (about 85 ml) was pipetted into the Kimex<br>
hydrometer testing tube, and temperature and hydrometer measurements were determined.<br>
The solutions were finally pipetted (50 ml) into each of 5 petri dishes, dried, and the dry<br>
sucrose weight per 100 ml solution determined.<br>
Results: The rate of sucrose dissolution increased with exposure of the solvent water<br>
to the sodium lamp, as compared to unconditioned control water. After two hours exposure<br>
to the sodium lamp, the conditioned water dissolved about 7% more sucrose than the<br>
untreated control water.<br>

Example 25d<br>
Phenyl Solicvlate Solubility in Acetone at Room Temperature (22°C)<br>
Acetone (about 1 ml) was pipetted into small glass test tubes and stoppers placed in<br>
the tube. Tubes were placed under a neon lam; (about 8m/cm2) in an otherwise dark room<br>
for about 1-5 hours at about 28°C ambient temperature. Tubes were also placed<br>
simultaneously in an incubator at 28°C for about 1.5 hours.<br>
Phenyl solicylate (about 3.50 grams) was added to each tube leaving a layer<br>
undissolved on the bottom of each tube. The solutions were allowed to equilibrate (about 20<br>
hours). Solution was filtered over the crystals and 0.500 ml pipetted into fresh tubes.<br>
After the acetone evaporated, dry weights of phenyl solicylate per ml dissolved in<br>
conditioned and unconditioned acetone were determined.<br>
Results: Average amounts of phenyl salicylate dissolved in conditioned acetone was<br>
0.78g/ml. Average amount dissolved in unconditioned acetone was 0.68 g/ml.<br>

Example 26a<br>
Spectral Enhancement of Mercury-Silver Metal Alloy Crystallization<br>
Silver nitrate (about 2.0 grams) was added to about 80 ml distilled water (stored in<br>
white, semi-opaque plastic one-gallon jugs in cardboard boxes with thick black opaque<br>
drapes, in a darkened, shielded room). The solution was allowed to equilibrate for about 1.5<br>
hours in ambient laboratory lighting before pipetting about two (2) ml into each of 36 small<br>
test tubes. Mercury (about 2 drops) was added to each tube. Eighteen of the test tubes were<br>
placed into the incubator as controls at about 28°C. Eighteen test tubes were placed on a<br>
black non-reflective surface about 14 inches (about 35 cm) from the mercury lamp<br>
(47 mW/cm2). Ambient room temperature was about 28°C, in an otherwise dark room.<br>
About four hours later the ambient temperature under the mercury lamp was noted to<br>
be about 30°C and the test tubes on the black non-reflective surface were moved to a distance<br>
of about 29.5 inches (about 75 cm) from the Hg lamp at a light intensity of about 4.5<br>
mW/cm2, where ambient temperature remained at about 28°C. Crystals in test tubes under<br>
the mercury lamp measured up to about 10 mm long at this time, while crystals in the<br>
incubator measured up to about 3 mm long.<br>
Results: The crystals were evaluated after about 20 hours after the addition of the<br>
mercury. Photomicrographs were taken at about 10X magnification (not shown herein).<br>
Heights of the crystals formed were determined from measurements taken from the<br>
photomicrographs and plotted in graphs shown in Figures 82a and 82b. The average height<br>
of the incubator control metal alloy crystals was about 7 mm, with branched dendrites in one<br>
tube. The average height of the mercury spectrally irradiated metal alloy crystals was about<br>
12 mm, with branched dendrites in 7 tubes, six of which contained excessively branched<br>
dendrites. Three of the spectrally grown crystals were about 22-25 mm high. The mercury<br>
spectral pattern catalyzed enhanced growth of the mercury-silver alloy and morphology was<br>
significantly different.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energy was used to affect phase change and<br>
structure.<br>
Example 26b<br>
Mercurv-Silver Metal Alloy Crystallization Using Water Conditioned for One Hour<br>
Distilled water (about 40 ml) at about 18°C (stored in a white, semi-opaque plastic<br>
one-gallon jug in a dark, shielded cabinet) was pipetted into a 125 ml Pyrex beaker and was<br>
conditioned by irradiation under a sodium lamp for about one hour. Another 125 ml Pyrex<br>
beaker with distilled water (about 40 ml) at about 1S°C was placed into the incubator at 28°C<br>
at the same time. At the end of about one hour, water temperatures in both beakers were<br>
21°C and the volume unchanged. Silver nitrate (about 1.00 gram) was added to each beaker.<br>
The solutions (about 2 ml) were each pipetted into 16 small test tubes and mercury (about<br>
100 µl) was added to each tube. All of the test tubes were placed in the incubator at about<br>
2S°C.<br>
Results: The crystals were evaluated after about 17 hours after addition of the<br>
mercury. Photomicrographs were taken at about 10X magnification (not shown herein). The<br>
heights of the formed crystals were determined from measurements taken from the<br>
photomicrographs and plotted in graphs shown in Figures 83a and S3b. The average height<br>
of the control metal alloy crystals was about 8 mm, the tallest being about 13 mm, and one<br>
tube contained a simple branched dendritic crystal. The average height of the mercury-silver<br>
metal alloy crystals grown from conditioned water was about 9 mm, the tallest about 25 mm.<br>
Three tubes contained excessively branched dendritic crystals.<br>
Growth of the mercury-silver alloy was slightly greater in the solution made with<br>
sodium lamp conditioned water, and morphology was different compared to the control<br>
solution.<br>
In this Example, targeted spectral energies were used, to change the material<br>
properties of a solvent and influenced phase and structure in formed crystals.<br>

Conductivity of Sodium Chloride Aqueous Solution<br>
Procedures similar to those discussed in detail in Example 24 were followed with the<br>
following specific differences.<br>
Water (about 800 ml) was placed in a 1000ml beaker and room temperature<br>
measurements were obtained for conductivity (S/cm), dissolved solids (ppm), and resistance<br>
(kOhms), after allowing about 10 minutes for the probe to equilibrate to the water. The water<br>
was then heated to about 56.1°C, and measurements were repeated. Sodium chloride (about<br>
0.01 gram) was added and stirred with a glass stir rod for about 30 seconds. Measurements<br>
of conductivity were obtained about every 2 minutes for about 20 minutes, and a final<br>
measurement was taken at about 40 minutes. Dissolved solids and resistance measurements<br>
were also obtained at about 4 minutes, at about 14 minutes, and at about 20 minutes after<br>
adding the salt.<br>
The experimental apparatuses used to obtain data are shown in Figures 76 and 77. A<br>
conditioning probe was substituted for the pH probe of Example 24.<br>
Four sets of parameters were evaluated, with three tests within each set:<br>
1. Bunsen burner heating only (apparatus corresponding to Figure 76);<br>
2. Sodium lamp irradiation of water about 40 minutes before adding the salt<br>
(apparatus corresponding to Figure 77);<br>

corresponding to Figure 77);<br>
