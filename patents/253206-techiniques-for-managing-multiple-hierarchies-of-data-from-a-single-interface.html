TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING MULTIPLE HIERARCHIES OF<br>
DATA FROM A SINGLE INTERFACE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit of Provisional Appln. 60/424,543, filed<br>
November 6,2002, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if<br>
fully set forth herein, under 35 U.S.C. ยง119(e).<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to techniques for managing hierarchical data,<br>
and, in particular, to techniques for managing multiple hierarchies of data from a single<br>
integrated interface.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Some data are naturally organized as hierarchies. Hierarchies are well-known<br>
mathematical constructs. In general, a hierarchy is composed of nodes at multiple levels.<br>
The nodes at each level are each linked to one or more nodes at a different level. Each<br>
node at a level below the top level is a child node of one or more of the parent nodes at<br>
the level above. In a tree hierarchy, each child node has only one parent node, but a parent<br>
node may have multiple child nodes. In a tree hierarchy, a node that has no parent node<br>
linked to it is the root node, and a node that has no child nodes linked to it is a leaf node.<br>
A tree hierarchy typically has a single root node.<br>
[0004] For example, a flexible file system used by a computer operating system to<br>
store contents on a computer readable medium is often organized into a hierarchy of<br>
"folders" or "directories." Each folder can contain any number of files that store data on<br>
a computer readable medium and any number of other folders. The folder that contains<br>
the files and other folders is the parent node of those files and folders. The files and other<br>
folders are the child nodes of that folder. The system typically has one root folder.<br>
[0005] Also, data elements in the extensible markup language (XML) are arranged<br>
into a tree hierarchy. XML is widely used to store data and exchange data between<br>
independent applications. Each data element in XML may be composed of zero or more<br>
child elements. Each element also has an element name and zero or more additional<br>
element attributes. The XML document is the single root element.<br>
[0006] While convenient for many purposes, operations on data organized by<br>
hierarchies, such as file systems and XML documents, can be difficult to express.<br><br>
Operations may include, for example, creating, retrieving data from, writing data to,<br>
copying, moving and deleting the nodes of the hierarchies, such as files or XML<br>
elements. The expression of the nodes and operations may vary from one hierarchical<br>
data system to another. It would be convenient to operate on data spread among multiple<br>
hierarchies with a single integrated interface that uses a single set of expressions for the<br>
nodes and operations.<br>
[0007] In one approach, nodes from multiple hierarchies are assembled into one<br>
system with an established and convenient interface that functions on a user's equipment<br>
(called hereinafter the user's "native system"). For example, in one native system, nodes<br>
in a hierarchy are stored in a node table in a relational database, and the parent-child<br>
relationships are stored in a hierarchical index. Such an index may list, for example,<br>
every parent node, and for each parent node, all of the child nodes that are immediately<br>
below the parent node in the hierarchy. ID such a system, SQL commands can be used to<br>
list the nodes that satisfy certain criteria. Operations on the nodes can be performed by<br>
one or more stored procedures.<br>
[0008] Maintaining a node table and hierarchical index in this manner enables one to<br>
use an SQL query on a file system to find the path from a root folder to a particular folder<br>
or file that satisfies certain criteria on the folder or file attributes. For example, one can<br>
get the file names and the paths from the root folder for all files that are owned by user<br>
Scott and were created between January 1,2001 and January 10,2001, assuming "owner"<br>
and "creation date" are attributes of the files in the node table. Then, one can copy those<br>
files to a new folder or otherwise operate on those files.<br>
[0010] While this approach works well for many kinds of data organized in<br>
hierarchies, the approach has some shortcomings. For example, in many cases, the non-<br>
native (i.e., foreign) hierarchical data systems provide resources for storing and retrieving<br>
the data. To import that data into the native system causes the native system to devote its<br>
own resources to store data that are already stored elsewhere. This can greatly increase<br>
the expense of mamtaining the native system.<br>
[0011] Furthermore, the number of nodes in the foreign systems may be large, yet the<br>
users of the native system may wish to operate on those nodes infrequently. Importing all<br>
those nodes into the native system may bloat the hierarchical index of the native system.<br>
A bloated index can lead to increased response time and overall degraded performance by<br>
the native system.<br>
[0012] In addition, incorporating a new foreign system consumes resources on the<br>
user's systems that increase with the amount of data in the new foreign system. The data<br><br>
contents of the new system have to be copied from the new system to the native system,<br>
and the native indexes have to be updated. Similarly, detaching a foreign system also<br>
consumes resources that increase with the amount of the data in the foreign system. The<br>
data contents may have to be deleted from the native system and the native indexes have<br>
to be updated. If the contents of the foreign system are changed, the native system may<br>
have to both detach the old version of the foreign system and incorporate the new version.<br>
Consuming so many resources to attach and detach foreign systems can lead to overall<br>
degraded performance by the native system.<br>
[0013] Furthermore, there may be aspects of data security that preclude importing the<br>
foreign data into the native system. For example, the foreign system may control access<br>
to data in the foreign hierarchy based on an unusual or proprietary security model that<br>
might be difficult or impermissible to express or enforce in the native system.<br>
[0014] Based on the foregoing, there is a clear need for techniques to manage<br>
hierarchical data in multiple hierarchies with a single interface, which do not suffer the<br>
above deficiencies. In particular, there is a need for techniques to manage data distributed<br>
among multiple hierarchies with a single interface without importing all the data into a<br>
single hierarchical data system.<br>
[0015] The past approaches described in this section could be pursued, but are not<br>
necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore,<br>
unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not to be<br>
considered prior art to the claims in this application merely due to the presence of these<br>
approaches in this background section.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021] Techniques are described for managing data containers arranged in multiple<br>
hierarchies. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous<br>
specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present<br>
invention. It will be apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced<br>
without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are<br>
shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0022] In the following, embodiments of the invention are described in the context of<br>
managing multiple hierarchical file systems from a native hierarchical file system stored<br>
in a relational database. However, the techniques and mechanisms described herein are<br>
not limited to this context. In other embodiments, the native system is another<br>
management system for a hierarchy of data containers.<br>
[0023] As used herein, the term "data container" designates the data associated with a<br>
node, whether that data is a folder, a file, an XML element, or some other grouping of<br>
data in the hierarchy, such as an entry in one or more columns of a relational database<br>
table. In some embodiments, other hierarchical data, such as an XML document, may<br>
form one or more of the hierarchies of data containers.<br>
[0024] According to one embodiment, a technique for managing multiple hierarchies<br>
of data containers from a single native hierarchy includes:<br>
โข	Register a set of routines for each hierarchy that is not the native hierarchy. For each<br>
hierarchy, the set of routines performs a set of operations on a data container in the<br>
hierarchy.<br>
โข	Receive user requests that indicate a particular operation on a particular data container<br>
that does not correspond to a node of the native hierarchy.<br>
โข	Based on the user request, determine a first operation on a first set of one or more<br>
nodes of a first hierarchy that is not the native hierarchy.<br>
โข	Select a particular routine that corresponds to the first operation from a first set of<br>
routines registered for the first hierarchy during the registering step.<br>
โข	Invoke the particular routine to operate on the first set of one or more nodes.<br>
[0025] The techniques described herein allow a user to employ a consistent interface<br>
with the native hierarchy in order to reach a data container in any of the hierarchies<br>
registered with the system that manages the native hierarchy. Because registered<br><br>
functions are invoked to reach foreign data containers, the data contained in the foreign<br>
data containers do not need to be incorporated into the native hierarchy. Thus, fewer<br>
resources of the system that manages the native hierarchy are consumed for searching the<br>
data in the foreign data containers or for incorporating or detaching the contents of all the<br>
foreign data containers.<br>
EXAMPLE HIERARCHICAL FILE SYSTEMS<br>
[0026] FIG.' 1 is a block diagram that illustrates multiple hierarchies 100 of nodes<br>
and links in multiple file systems, according to an embodiment. A native hierarchy 101<br>
includes multiple nodes 110 that each corresponds to a folder or a file in a native file<br>
system. Nodes 110a, 110b, 110c, 110e, 110f, correspond to folders in the file system and<br>
are parent nodes to one or more other nodes; and nodes 110d, 110g, correspond to files in<br>
the file system, which are always leaf nodes that are not parents to any other nodes. The<br>
term "resource" is used hereinafter to refer to an item that may be either a folder or a file;<br>
thus all nodes 110 correspond to resources. Ellipsis 111 indicates other nodes 110 in the<br>
hierarchy 101 that correspond to other resources in the file system.<br>
[0027] The nodes 110 are connected to other nodes 110 by links 120. A link 120<br>
associates one node 110 with a different, single node 110. Link 120a associates parent<br>
node 110a with child node 110b. Similarly, links 120b, 120c, 120d, 120e, 120f, 120g,<br>
and 120h associate one parent node 110 with one child node 110. Ellipsis 121 indicates<br>
other links 120 in the hierarchy 101 that correspond to one-to-one associations among<br>
other resources in the file system.<br>
[0028] FIG. 1 also depicts two foreign hierarchies 102,103, which include resources<br>
managed in two independent, foreign file systems. Foreign hierarchy 102 includes nodes<br>
130a, 130b, and 130c, among other nodes indicated by ellipsis 131, collectively<br>
referenced hereinafter as foreign nodes 130, that each correspond to a resource in one of<br>
the foreign filing systems. Nodes 130a and 130b correspond to folders in the foreign file<br>
system and are parent nodes to one or more other nodes; and node 130c corresponds to a<br>
file in the foreign file system, which is a leaf node. Foreign hierarchy 102 includes links<br>
140a, and 140b, among other links indicated by ellipsis 141, collectively referenced<br>
hereinafter as foreign links 140.<br>
[0029] Foreign hierarchy 103 includes nodes 150a, 150b, and 150c, among other<br>
nodes indicated by ellipsis 151, collectively referenced hereinafter as foreign nodes 150,<br>
that each correspond to a resource in a second foreign filing system. Nodes 150a and<br>
150c correspond to folders in the second foreign file system and are parent nodes to one<br><br>
or more other nodes; and node 150b corresponds to a file in the foreign file system, which<br>
is a leaf node. Foreign hierarchy 103 includes links 160a, and 160b, among other links<br>
indicated by ellipsis 161, collectively referenced hereinafter as foreign links 160.<br>
[0030] Each node 110,130,150 has one or more attributes that correspond to<br>
properties of the corresponding resource. For example, node attributes may correspond to<br>
one or more of a resource name, a resource type (indicating whether file or folder, or<br>
indicating a file type or a folder type), a resource creation date, a resource modification<br>
date, a resource owner, a resource size, and a list of one or more resource authors, among<br>
other properties of the resource.<br>
[0031J Each link 120,140,160 has one or more attributes that describe the<br>
association between the nodes that the link connects. For example, link attributes may<br>
correspond to one or more of a link name, a link type (indicating, for example whether the<br>
link represents a parent-child relationship or another relationship, such a sibling<br>
relationship, a grandparent-grandchild relationship, or an aunt-niece relationship), a link<br>
creation date, a link modification date, a link owner, a link owner type (e.g., a soft link<br>
with only one owner who creates or deletes the child, or a hard link with multiple owners<br>
any of whom may create and all of whom must delete the child), and a link descriptive<br>
text, among other properties of the link.<br>
[0032] In many file systems, all links are implied. The implied links are of the same<br>
types ( e.g., parent-child soft links), have no names independent of the nodes, and do not<br>
have any attributes.<br>
[0033] A path represents a sequence of links from one node (start node) to another<br>
node (finish node) in a hierarchy. Any method known in the art to specify the path may<br>
be used. Often, a path is specified by a path name that lists the links between the start<br>
node and the finish node. In many file systems, a path name is constructed by combining<br>
link names of the links, separated by a delimiting set of one or more special characters, in<br>
the order of traversal from start node to finish node. Often the start node is the root node<br>
of the hierarchy. For example, a path from folder 110a to file 110d is given by the path<br>
name:<br>
/L120a/L120c<br>
where LX denotes the name of the link "X", where X is replaced by the numeral<br>
representing the link in FIG. 1; and the character "/" is used to delimit the link names. In<br>
file systems that employ implied links, or, at least, implied link names, the name of the<br>
parent node and child node associated with the link is used instead of the link name. . In<br>
a path name, the name of an intermediate node along the path is not repeated for its role<br><br>
as the child in one link and the parent in the next link, but is used only once. In such a<br>
file system, the path from folder 110a to file 1 lOd is given by the path name:<br>
/N110a/N110b/N110d<br>
where NY denotes the name of the node "Y", where Y is replaced by the numeral<br>
representing the node in FIG. 1.<br>
[0034] A path is useful as output from the relational database system, because<br>
resources in different folders can have the same name, and those resources are<br>
distinguished by the paths leading to them. A particular resource is indicated by the path<br>
name and the resource name. The file systems operate on data (such as data in a file or<br>
lists of files in a folder) from the resource uniquely specified by the path.<br>
[0035] As shown in FIG. 1, in some hierarchies, there may be more than one path<br>
leading to the same node. For example, three paths lead to file 110g from the root node<br>
110a:<br>
/L120a/L120d/L120g<br>
/L120b/L120f/L120h<br>
/L120b/L120e/L120g<br>
[0036] Hierarchies in which more than one path leads to a child node are said to<br>
include cycles. Such hierarchies are represented as graphs rather than as trees.<br>
[0037] FIG. 1 also depicts two virtual links, 190a and 190b, hereinafter referenced<br>
collectively as virtual links 190. A virtual link 190 includes a reference to a foreign file<br>
system that manages a foreign hierarchy. The virtual link 190 renders a folder in the<br>
native hierarchy as a parent node for a node of the foreign hierarchy.<br>
FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW<br>
[0038] According to embodiments of the invention, resources 130,150 and links 140,<br>
160 in the foreign hierarchies 102,103 are considered virtual resources in the native<br>
hierarchy 101. The foreign hierarchies 102,103 are connected to the native hierarchy<br>
through corresponding virtual links, 190a, 190b, collectively referenced hereinafter as<br>
virtual links 190. Functions, to perform a set of basic file system operations on resources<br>
and links in a foreign hierarchy, are registered for each foreign hierarchy connected by a<br>
virtual link 190.<br>
[0039] When traversing one of the virtual links from a native folder to a virtual<br>
resource during an operation involving a target virtual resource, one of the registered<br>
functions is invoked. The registered function that is invoked corresponds to a particular<br><br>
operation to perform on the target virtual resource. An input parameter of the invoked<br>
function indicates the target virtual resource.<br>
[0040] By invoking registered functions, file systems operations can be performed on<br>
nodes and links in the foreign file systems without importing those nodes or links into the<br>
native file system. Since nodes and links are not imported into the native system, the<br>
native system does not expend native system resources to manage these foreign nodes and<br>
links. This allows a user to employ a consistent interface with the native hierarchy in<br>
order to reach a data container in any of the foreign hierarchies registered with the native<br>
hierarchy without importing the nodes or links of the foreign file system.<br>
STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW<br>
[0041] FIG. 2 is a block diagram that illustrates a system 200, for managing resources<br>
in multiple hierarchies, according to an embodiment The system 200 includes a resource<br>
management server 220, one or more resource clients 210, and one or more foreign<br>
hierarchies servers 240.<br>
[0042] In the illustrated embodiment, the resource management server 220 is an<br>
application that provides file system services for resources in a file system. Well known<br>
file system services include listing contents of a folder, creating a resource in a folder,<br>
deleting a resource from a folder, getting data from a file, getting properties of a resource,<br>
moving a resource from one folder to another, and copying a resource from one folder to<br>
another.<br>
[0043] Resource clients 210 include any application that requests file system services<br>
involving resources in one or more hierarchies from resource management server 220. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, resource clients 210 include resource client 210a and resource<br>
client 210b, among other resource clients represented by ellipsis 211.<br>
[0044] Foreign hierarchies servers 240 include any application that provides file<br>
system services on resources in a foreign file system. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
foreign hierarchy servers 240 include foreign hierarchy server 240a and foreign hierarchy<br>
server 240b, among other foreign hierarchy servers represented by ellipsis 241. Each<br>
foreign hierarchy server 240 includes data representing the resources and links that<br>
correspond to the nodes and links of a corresponding foreign hierarchy. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, foreign hierarchy server 240a includes the resources and links of foreign<br>
hierarchy 102 in FIG. 1, and foreign hierarchy server 240b includes the resources and<br>
links of foreign hierarchy 103 in FIG. 1. One or more of the foreign hierarchy servers<br>
240 may reside on the same host as the resource management server 220. Any or all of<br><br>
foreign hierarchy servers 240 may reside on one or more hosts different from the host of<br>
resource management server 220.<br>
[0045] In other embodiments, resource management server 220 is replaced by a data<br>
container management server, which is an application that provides services for data<br>
containers in other hierarchical systems that might not be file systems, such as XML<br>
documents. Services for data containers may include services similar to file system<br>
services, such as listing contents of a parent container, creating a child container in a<br>
parent container, deleting a child container from a parent container, getting data from a<br>
container, getting properties of a container, moving a container from one parent container<br>
to another, and copying a container from one parent container to another, In other<br>
embodiments, resource clients 210 are replaced by data container clients, which are<br>
applications that request data container services involving one or more hierarchies. In<br>
other embodiments, foreign hierarchy servers are foreign systems that manage<br>
hierarchical data containers, such as foreign file systems and different systems for editing<br>
contents of XML documents.<br>
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SERVER<br>
[0046] The resource management server 220 includes native hierarchy data 222, a<br>
hierarchical processing engine 230, a client interface 232, and registered function sets<br>
234, including registered function set 234a and registered function set 234b, among other<br>
registered function sets represented by ellipsis 231.<br>
[0047] The native hierarchy data 222 includes the resources and links that correspond<br>
to the nodes and links of the native hierarchy, such as hierarchy 101 in FIG. 1. Any<br>
method known in the art for representing the native hierarchy, when the resource<br>
management server 220 is implemented, may be employed. For example, the data<br>
representing resources and links are arranged as described in Agarwal.<br>
[0048] The client interface 232 provides access to one or more clients for sending<br>
requests for the services of the resource management server 220. The requests sent by<br>
clients 210 can be expressed in any manner known in the art. In some embodiments, the<br>
requests are messages sent from a client 210 executing on one host to the resource<br>
management server 220 executing on a different host over a network using a message<br>
exchange protocol. For example, in some embodiments, the requests are file transfer<br>
protocol (FTP) requests, well known in the art. In some embodiments, the requests are<br>
hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests. In some embodiments, the requests use a<br>
protocol called web-based distributed authoring and versioning ("WebDAV") that<br><br>
extends HTTP to support hierarchical operations over the internet that mimic popular file<br>
systems. In the system of Agarwal, the messages include a statement in a structured<br>
query language (SQL) of a relational database management system that manages<br>
hierarchical data representing resources and links in a file system.<br>
[0049] In some embodiments, the client requests are not expressed as messages, but<br>
as calls to routines specified in an application programming interface (API). Each API is<br>
specified for a high level programming language, such as JAVA (hereinafter, called<br>
"Java"), C, and a SQL procedural language called PL/SQL. The use of APIs is well<br>
known in the art. The API names a routine that can be called by the client and lists the<br>
parameter and parameter types used as arguments when the routine is called. According<br>
to some embodiments, APIs in several programming languages are provided for obtaining<br>
file system services from resource management server 220.<br>
[0050] The hierarchical processing engine 230 is a process that determines and<br>
executes operations on one or more resources or links of the native hierarchy and the<br>
foreign hierarchies, which operations are involved in satisfying the request received from<br>
the client 210. The hierarchical processing engine 230 is described in more detail in a<br>
later section with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
[0051] The registered function sets 234 are processes that make requests for services<br>
from the foreign hierarchy servers 240. Data modules, which include instructions that<br>
cause a processor to perform the processes of each registered functions set, are registered<br>
with the resource management server 220; and those instructions are executed when the<br>
hierarchical processing engine 230 invokes a function from the function set. Such<br>
modules of instructions that are executed by another process are well known in the art as<br>
"plug-in" modules. A method for registering a module for each registered function set is<br>
described in a later section with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
[0052] In some embodiments, each of one or more of the foreign hierarchies servers<br>
240 is a resource management server, like resource management server 220, which has its<br>
own native hierarchy data and registered function sets' for one or more hierarchy servers<br>
foreign to it.<br>
[0053] Using the resource management server 220, a client may interact with the<br>
single interface 232 and obtain resources from any of several hierarchies, including the<br>
native hierarchy and one or more foreign hierarchies.<br><br>
METHOD FOR MANAGING MULTIPLE HIERARCHIES<br>
[0054] FIG. 3 is a flow diagram that illustrates, at a high level, a method for<br>
managing resources in multiple hierarchies, according to an embodiment. Although steps<br>
are presented in FIG. 3, in a particular order, in other embodiments the steps may be<br>
performed in a different order or overlapping in time.<br>
REGISTER FUNCTION SET<br>
[0055] In step 310, a function set 234 is registered for each foreign hierarchy of<br>
resources to be managed by the resource management server 220. Any method for<br>
registering a set of one or more functions with another application may be used. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, an API for function calls made by the hierarchical processing<br>
engine 230 is established, and a module that includes instructions matched to that API is<br>
provided to resource management server 220 by an integration administrator who wishes<br>
to incorporate a foreign hierarchy. Resource management server 220 stores an<br>
association between each foreign hierarchy and the corresponding module.<br>
[0056] In an illustrated embodiment, the function set includes functions to perform<br>
the basic file system operations listed in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
[0057] In other embodiments, more or fewer operations and corresponding functions<br>
may be included in each function set. For example, operations and corresponding<br>
functions may be included in each function set. For example, operations for deleting,<br>
renaming, and copying links may be added; or operations for copy and rename can be<br>
omitted by substituting a combination of delete and create operations.<br>
[0058] In some embodiments, each function in the module has a name that matches<br>
the basic operation name and a parameter list that matches the operands. Each function<br>
then includes one or more instructions to generate commands that cause the<br>
corresponding foreign hierarchy server to perform the operation described in Table 1 for<br>
that operation.<br>
[0059] During step 310, one or more modules with functions to perform the<br>
operations of Table 1 are registered with the resource management server 220 for each<br>
foreign hierarchy managed by foreign hierarchy servers 240. In some embodiments, the<br>
name of the path or folder where the foreign node is to be linked to the native hierarchy is<br>
also specified. In some embodiments, other properties of the foreign hierarchy are also<br>
specified when the module is registered. For example, it is specified whether resources in<br>
the foreign hierarchy may be modified or not; a resource that can not be modified is said<br>
to be "read-only," a resource that can be modified is said to be "modifiable." It may be<br>
specified whether a resource or link of the foreign hierarchy can be found by searching on<br>
properties or contents of the resource or link; a foreign hierarchy that allows such<br>
searches is said to be "searchable." If the foreign hierarchy is searchable, then, in some<br><br>
embodiments, one or more search functions are added to the function set, and a module to<br>
invoke the foreign hierarchy's search capability is provided during registration. If the<br>
resources or links of the foreign hierarchy can be modified, then it may be specified<br>
whether such modifications are committed automatically when made (called "auto-<br>
committed"), or are committed only when a transaction of several steps is completed and<br>
an explicit commit action is taken, such as invoking a commit function (called<br>
"transactional"). In some embodiments, the root node of the foreign hierarchy is<br>
associated, by default, with the specified path name to the virtual link. In some<br>
embodiments a non-root node of the foreign hierarchy is associated with the virtual link;<br>
in such embodiments the path name in the foreign hierarchy to the associated non-root<br>
node is also included during registration in step 310.<br>
[0060] In some embodiments a mapping is generated during step 310 that associates<br>
the function set for one foreign hierarchy with the path name to the virtual link 190 that<br>
associates a folder in the native hierarchy with a node in that foreign hierarchy. In some<br>
embodiments, the mapping is done at the level of individual functions in the module, so<br>
that the functions may be spread over one or more modules, and the function names may<br>
differ from the basic operation names in Table 1.<br>
[0061] In some embodiments, the link properties of the native hierarchy include<br>
attributes that indicate whether the link is a virtual link 190, and, if so, the name of the<br>
module where the function set is stored, or a list of the module and functions names of<br>
each function in the function set. While traversing a path, when the virtual link is<br>
encountered, the operation is performed using the associated module or function on a<br>
resource on the portion of the path following the virtual link.<br>
[0062] For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that the registration of a function set<br>
is done by invoking a routine of the resource management server 220 called<br>
"create _virtual_folder" and specifying the following information as parameters of that<br>
routine in the following order:<br>
1.	path name where the virtual folder is associated with the native folder;<br>
2.	modules and function names for the basic operations in the order of Table 1;<br>
3.	flags indicating whether searchable, read-only, and transactional.<br>
In this embodiment, the virtual folder is always the root node of the foreign hierarchy. It<br>
is further assumed, for purposes of illustration, that the modules named "Basicl02A" and<br>
"Basicl02B" contain the function set for the foreign hierarchy 102 shown in FIG. 1, and<br>
foreign hierarchy 102 is neither searchable nor modifiable. Then, foreign hierarchy 102<br><br>
can be registered with the resource management server 220 for native hierarchy 101<br>
under folder 1 lOe, as shown in FIG. 1, with the following statement:<br>
create_virtual_folder ( /L120a/L120d/L190a,<br>
Basicl02A.get_folder,<br>
Basicl02A.begin_fblder_list,<br>
Basicl02A.next_in_folder_list,<br>
Basicl 02A.end_folder_list,<br>
Basicl02A.get_file,<br>
Basic 102 A.get_attributes,<br>
Basicl02B.get_link_attributes,<br>
Basic 102 A.no_operation,<br>
Basic 102 A.no_operation,<br>
Basicl 02A.no_operation,<br>
Basic 102A.no_operation,<br>
Basic 102 A.no_operation,<br>
Basic l02A.no_operation,<br>
Basic 102 A.no_operation,<br>
NOT_SEARCHABLE,<br>
READ_ONLY,<br>
NULL)<br>
In some embodiments, link names are implied by the resource name of the parent<br>
resource and child resource. In such' embodiments, the path name "/L120a/L120d/L190a"<br>
as the first argument of the create_virtual_folder routine is replaced by the path name<br>
"/Nl10a/Nl10b/N110e/N130a".<br>
[0063] It is further assumed, for purposes of illustration, that the module named<br>
"BasicOpl03" contains the function set for the foreign hierarchy 103 shown in FIG. 1,<br>
and foreign hierarchy 103 is modifiable but not searchable, where the modifications are<br>
automatically committed. Then, foreign hierarchy 103 can be registered with the resource<br>
management server 220 for native hierarchy 101 under folder 110f, as shown in FIG. 1,<br>
with the following statement:<br>
create_virtual_folder ( /L120b/L120f/L190b,<br>
BasicOp 103 .folder_contents,<br>
BasicOp 103 .begjn_list,<br>

BasicOpl03.rename,<br>
BasicOp 103 .copy,<br>
NOT_SEARCHABLE,<br>

AUTO_COMMIT)<br>
The result of these registrations is a mapping as summarized in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
PROCESS CLIENT REQUESTS<br>
[0064] In step 320, a file system request is received at resource management server<br>
220 from a client 210 to operate on the files and folders in the multiple hierarchies 100.<br>
For example, a request is received at interface 232 to list all contents under folder 110e.<br>
The request may be received in any manner known in the art, for example in an<br>
HTTP/WebDAV message. For example, the request includes the expression, "list all<br>
under folder /L120a/L120d/N110e." The desired result of this request is a listing of the<br>
names of the resources under that folder, e.g. the name N110g of native file 110g, the<br>
name N130a of foreign folder 130a, the name N130b of foreign folder 130b, the name<br>
N130c of foreign file 130c, and the names of other resources indicated by ellipsis 131,<br>
preceded by appropriate path names.<br><br>
{0065] In step 330, the hierarchical processing engine 230 determines a native<br>
operation on a native resource or link, if any, and a foreign operation on foreign resource<br>
or link, if any, based on the request. For example, the engine 230 determines that the<br>
request to list all involves a next native operation to get contents of folder 110e.<br>
[0066] In step 350, the next native operation is performed, which returns<br>
identifications for native link 120g to native file 110g and virtual link 190a to foreign<br>
folder 130a. It is assumed, for purposes of illustration, that the virtual link 190a is stored<br>
in the native hierarchy data 222 and includes the name of the root node of the foreign<br>
hierarchy 102. The name of the links and resources are inserted into a results data<br>
structure for returning to the client. It is assumed, for purposes of illustration, that the<br>
results data structure is updated to include the following, designated Rl:<br>
/L120g/N110g, /L190a/N130a	(R1)<br>
[0067] In the illustrated embodiment, step 330 overlaps step 350 in time, so that after<br>
the native operation is performed in step 350, as described above, the processing engine<br>
230 determines the next foreign operation in step 330. In step 330, the hierarchical<br>
processing engine 230 recognizes that native file 1 lOg has no children but that folder<br>
130a might. In the illustrated embodiment, during registration in step 310, described<br>
above, a mapping was stored that associates a path ending in link 190a with a function set<br>
for foreign hierarchy 102. Thus the hierarchical processing engine 230 knows that folder<br>
130a is a foreign folder for hierarchy 102, because it is under link 190a. Therefore, in the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the next foreign operation is a get-folder-contents operation on<br>
/L190a/N130a. Using the path name in the mapping in Table 2, it is determined that the<br>
foreign operations are those in the middle column of Table 2, which are associated with<br>
path name /L120a/120d/L190a.<br>
[0068J In step 360, a particular function is selected that corresponds to the next<br>
foreign operation from the function set registered for the particular foreign hierarchy. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, the function "Basic 102A.get_folder" is selected. As shown in<br>
Table 2, "Basic 102A.get_folder" corresponds to the basic operation "get-folder-contents"<br>
registered for the foreign hierarchy 102 under link 190a.<br>
[0069J In step 370, the selected function is invoked, In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
the function "Basic 102A.get_folder" is invoked with the operand specified for the basic<br>
operation, the path name and folder name of the folder. The path name and file name in<br>
the operand is below the virtual path 190a that indicates which foreign hierarchy. For<br>
example, the function is invoiced in the following expression, designated foreign function<br>
invocation 1 (FFI1)<br><br>
Basicl02A.get_folder("/N130a")	(FFI1)<br>
which returns /L140a/130b, L140b/130c.<br>
[0070] In step 380, the results from the native and foreign operations are combined<br>
with any extant results, adding path names as desired. For example, after step 380, the<br>
result data structure includes the following, designated R2.<br>
/L120g/N110g, /L190a/N130a, /L190a/L140a/130b, /L190a/L140b/130c (R2)<br>
[0071] In step 390, it is determined whether the operations performed in steps 350<br>
and 370 are the last operations involved in fulfilling the request from the client. If not,<br>
control passes back to step 330 to determine the next native and foreign operations to<br>
perform. For example, after getting the contents of folder 130a in step 370, the<br>
hierarchical processing engine 230, should still get the contents of the folder 130b, so<br>
control passes back to step 330. In step 330, it is determined that the next operation is to<br>
get the contents of folder /L190a/140a/130b. Because this folder is under /L1 90a, it is a<br>
foreign folder in hierarchy 102. Control passes to step 360 to select the correct function to<br>
get the folder contents, which again is "Basic 102A.get_folder." In step 370, the function<br>
is invoked to get the contents of folder /L190a/L140a/N130b using the portion of the path<br>
name below L190a, as shown in the following expression, FFI2.<br>
Basic 102A.get_folder("/L140a/N130b")	(FFI2)<br>
Any results obtained are added to the results data structure, in step 380. The loop from<br>
steps 330 to step 390 continues until no folder remains in foreign hierarchy 102.<br>
[0072] If it is determined in step 390 that the last operation has been performed to<br>
satisfy the client request, control passes to step 395. In step 395, the results are returned<br>
to the client 210 from the resource management server 220.<br>
[0073] In other embodiments, the results of the native operation to get the contents of<br>
folder 11 Oe, yields the links to the next nodes but not the node names. The names<br>
associated with a node are obtained from the get-resource-properties operation. To get the<br>
name of child node on link 120g, a native operation on native node 110g is performed.<br>
To get the name of the child node on virtual link 190a, a function associated with a<br>
foreign hierarchy has to be invoked. In this case, step 330 involves 1) determining the<br>
native function get-resource-properties to obtain the name for node 110g; and 2)<br>
determining that a corresponding foreign function should be used to obtain the name for<br>
node 130a. Thus a native operation and a foreign operation are determined based on the<br>
client request to list the contents of folder 110e.<br><br>
EXAMPLE REQUEST: GET FILE<br>
[0074] To further illustrate the use of method 300 for managing resources on multiple<br>
hierarchies, a client request to get the contents of a file on hierarchy 102 is described. It<br>
is assumed that a user of client 210a knows that file 130c exists on path<br>
/L120a/L120d/L190a/L140b/ as a result of the "list all" request described above. In a<br>
subsequent request considered here, client 210a sends a request to obtain the contents of<br>
this file from resource management server 220.<br>
[0075] In step 330, the hierarchical processing engine 230 receives a request to get<br>
file contents for /L120a/L120d7L190a/L140b/N130c, and breaks this into a native<br>
operation on a native resource and a foreign operation on a foreign resource. Specifically,<br>
the hierarchical processing engine 230 determines the native operation:<br>
get-file-contents from /L120a/L120d/L190a<br>
and the foreign operation:<br>
get-file-contents from /L140b/N130c.<br>
[0076] In step 350, the native operation is performed, if any. Since the path<br>
/L120a/L120d/L190a does not indicate a file, no file contents are obtained during step<br>
350.<br>
[0077] In step 360, the foreign function corresponding to get-file-contents is selected<br>
from the mapping in Table 2. The hierarchy under L190a is hierarchy 102. Under<br>
hierarchy 102, the corresponding foreign function is Basicl02A.get_file.<br>
[0078] In step 370, the foreign function is invoked on the foreign target<br>
/L140b/N130c. The expression formed by the hierarchical processing engine is given by<br>
FFD.<br>
Basicl02A.get_file(/L140b/N130c)	(FFI3)<br>
The result of FF13 is a data stream of contents from file 130c.<br>
[0079] In step 380, that data stream is placed into the results data structure. In step<br>
390, it is determined that there are no other operations to perform to satisfy the user<br>
request. In step 395, the data stream is sent to the client 210a in one or more messages to<br>
client 210a.<br>
[0080] Thus a native operation and a foreign operation are determined based on the<br>
client request to get the contents of file 130c.<br>
EXAMPLE REQUEST: COPY FILE<br>
[0081] To further illustrate the use of method 300 for managing resources on multiple<br>
hierarchies, a client request to copy a file on hierarchy 102 into a folder in hierarchy 103<br><br>
is described. It is assumed that a user of client 210a knows that file 130c exists on path<br>
/L120a/L120d/L190a/L140b/ as a result of the "list all" request described above. It is<br>
further assumed that a user of client 210a knows that folderl50c exists on path<br>
/L120b/L120f/L190b/L160b/ as a result of a list all request on folder 110f.<br>
[0082] In the request considered here, client 210a sends a request to resource<br>
management server 220, to copy a file 130c to folder 150c, using the expression Q1:<br>
Copy/L120a/L120d/L190a/L140b/N130c to /L120b/L120f/L190b/L160b/<br>
(Q1)<br>
[0083] In step 330, the hierarchical processing engine 230 receives the request Q1,<br>
and breaks this into a sequence of native operations on native resources and foreign<br>
operations on foreign resources. Because the source and destination files are not in the<br>
same foreign hierarchy, a copy operation cannot be performed in the foreign hierarchy.<br>
Instead, a file has to be created in the destination foreign hierarchy 103 based on the file<br>
contents in the source foreign hierarchy. In the illustrated embodiment, the hierarchical<br>
processing engine 230 determines the following specific sequence of operations:<br>
1.	native operation get-resource-properties from /L120a/L120d/L190a;<br>
2.	foreign operation get-resource-properties/L140b/N130c under L190a;<br>
3.	native operation get-file-contents from /L120a/L120d/L190a;<br>
4.	foreign operation get-file-contents from /L140b/N130c under L190a;<br>
5.	native operation create-file in folder /L120b/L120f/L190b, with name N130c,<br>
current properties, and the data stream from the get-file-contents operation;<br>
6.	foreign operation create-file in folder /L160b/150c, with name N130c, current<br>
properties, and the data stream from the get-file-contents operation under L190b;<br>
[0084] In step 350, the next native operation (1) is performed, if any. Since the path<br>
/L120a/L120d/L190a does not indicate a resource, no resource properties are obtained<br>
during step 350.<br>
[0085] In step 360, the foreign function corresponding to the next foreign operation<br>
(2), which is get-resource-properties, is selected from the mapping in Table 2. The<br>
hierarchy under L190a is hierarchy 102. Under hierarchy 102, the corresponding foreign<br>
function is Basic 102A.get_attributes.<br>
[0086] In step 370, the foreign function is invoked on the foreign target<br>
/L140b/N130c. The expression formed by the hierarchical processing engine is given by<br>
FFI4.<br>
Basic 102A.get_attributes(/L140b/N130c)	(FFI4)<br><br>
The result of FFI4 is a current attributes data structure of values for attributes for file<br>
130c, such as the owner, the date of creation, among others.<br>
[0087] In step 380, no results are stored in the results data structure. No results are<br>
returned to a client when a copy operation is performed.<br>
[0088] In step 390, it is determined that there are other operations to perform to<br>
satisfy the user request; specifically there are the operations 3,4, 5,6 listed above.<br>
[0089] In the next iteration of step 350, the next native operation (3) is performed.<br>
Since the path /L120a/L120d/L190a does not indicate a file, no file contents are obtained<br>
during step 350.<br>
[0090] In the next iteration of step 360, the foreign function corresponding to the next<br>
foreign operation (4), which is get-file-contents, is selected from the mapping in Table 2.<br>
The hierarchy under L190a is hierarchy 102. Under hierarchy 102, the corresponding<br>
foreign function is Basic 102A.get_file.<br>
[0091] In step 370, the foreign function is invoked on the foreign target<br>
/L140b/N130c. The expression formed by the hierarchical processing engine is given by<br>
FFI5 (similar to FFI3, described in the previous section).<br>
Basicl02A.get_file(/L140b/N130c)	(FFI5)<br>
The result of FFI5 is a data stream of contents from file 130c.<br>
[0092] In step 390, it is determined that there are other operations to perform to<br>
satisfy the user request; specifically there are the operations 5,6 listed above.<br>
[0093] In the next iteration of step 350, the next native operation (5) is performed,<br>
which is a create-file operation. Since the path /L120a/L120d/L190a does not indicate a<br>
folder, no file is created during step 350.<br>
[0094] In the next iteration of step 360, the foreign function corresponding to the next<br>
foreign operation (6), which is create-file, is selected from the mapping in Table 2. The<br>
hierarchy under L190b is hierarchy 103. Under hierarchy 103, the corresponding foreign<br>
function is BasicOp103.new_file.<br>
[0095] In step 370, the foreign function is invoked on the foreign target<br>
/L160b/N150c. The expression formed by the hierarchical processing engine is given by<br>
FFI6.<br>
BasicOp 103.new_file (/L160b/N150c,N130, properties, data stream)	(FFI6)<br>
Where properties indicates the values in the current attributes data structure. The result of<br>
FFI6 is a new file in hierarchy 103 based on the attributes and data stream of contents<br>
from file 130c.<br><br>
[0096] Thus several native operations and several foreign operations are determined<br>
based on the client request to copy the contents of file 130c in foreign hierarchy 102 to<br>
folder 150c in foreign hierarchy 103.<br>
HARDWARE OVERVIEW<br>
[0097] FIG. 4 is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system 400 upon which<br>
an embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Computer system 400 includes a<br>
bus 402 or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a<br>
processor 404 coupled with bus 402 for processing information. Computer system 400<br>
also includes a main memory 406, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other<br>
dynamic storage device, coupled to bus 402 for storing information and instructions to be<br>
executed by processor 404. Main memory 406 also may be used for storing temporary<br>
variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be<br>
executed by processor 404. Computer system 400 further includes a read only memory<br>
(ROM) 408 or other static storage device coupled to bus 402 for storing static information<br>
and instructions for processor 404. A storage device 410, such as a magnetic disk or<br>
optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus 402 for storing information and instructions.<br>
[0098] Computer system 400 may be coupled via bus 402 to a display 412, such as a<br>
cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device<br>
414, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus 402 for communicating<br>
information and command selections to processor 404. Another type of user input device<br>
is cursor control 416, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for<br>
cornmunicating direction information and command selections to processor 404 and for<br>
controlling cursor movement on display 412. This input device typically has two degrees<br>
of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the<br>
device to specify positions in a plane.<br>
[0099] The invention is related to the use of computer system 400 for implementing<br>
the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those<br>
techniques are performed by computer system 400 in response to processor 404 executing<br>
one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory 406. Such<br>
instructions may be read into main memory 406 from another computer-readable<br>
medium, such as storage device 410. Execution of the sequences of instructions<br>
contained in main memory 406 causes processor 404 to perform the process steps<br>
described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place<br>
of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus,<br><br>
embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware<br>
circuitry and software.<br>
[0100] The term "computer-readable medium" as used herein refers to any medium<br>
that participates in providing instructions to processor 404 for execution. Such a medium<br>
may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media,<br>
and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic<br>
disks, such as storage device 410. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as<br>
main memory 406. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber<br>
optics, including the wires that comprise bus 402. Transmission media can also take the<br>
form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio-wave and infra-red<br>
data communications.<br>
[0101] Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy<br>
disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-<br>
ROM, any other optical medium, punchcards, papertape, any other physical medium with<br>
patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory<br>
chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from<br>
which a computer can read.<br>
[0102] Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or<br>
more sequences of one or more instructions to processor 404 for execution. For example,<br>
the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The<br>
remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the<br>
instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system<br>
400 can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert<br>
the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the<br>
infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus 402. Bus 402 carries<br>
the data to main memory 406, from which processor 404 retrieves and executes the<br>
instructions. The instructions received by main memory 406 may optionally be stored on<br>
storage device 410 either before or after execution by processor 404.<br>
[0103] Computer system 400 also includes a communication interface 418 coupled to<br>
bus 402. Communication interface 418 provides a two-way data communication coupling<br>
to a network link 420 that is connected to a local network 422. For example,<br>
communication interface 418 may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card<br>
or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of<br>
telephone line. As another example, communication interface 418 may be a local area<br>
network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN.<br><br>
Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication<br>
interface 418 sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry<br>
digital data streams representing various types of information.<br>
[0104] Network link 420 typically provides data communication through one or more<br>
networks to other data devices. For example, network link 420 may provide a connection<br>
through local network 422 to a host computer 424 or to data equipment operated by an<br>
Internet Service Provider (ISP) 426. ISP 426 in turn provides data communication<br>
services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly<br>
referred to as the "Internet" 428. Local network 422 and Internet 428 both use electrical,<br>
electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the<br>
various networks and the signals on network link 420 and through communication<br>
interface 418, which carry the digital data to and from computer system 400, are<br>
exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.<br>
[0105] Computer system 400 can send messages and receive data, including program<br>
code, through the network(s), network link 420 and communication interface 418. In the<br>
Internet example, a server 430 might transmit a requested code for an application program<br>
through Internet 428, ISP 426, local network 422 and communication interface 418.<br>
[0106] The received code may be executed by processor 404 as it is received, and/or<br>
stored in storage device 410, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this<br>
manner, computer system 400 may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.<br>
[0107] In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference<br>
to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications<br>
and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of<br>
the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an<br>
illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.<br><br>

Abstract<br>
TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING MULTIPLE HIERARCHIES OF DATA FROM A<br>
SINGLE INTERFACE<br>
A computer system (220 of FIG. 2 &amp; 400 of FIG. 4) having one or more processors (e.g., 404 of FIG. 4) for managing multiple hierarchies (100 of FIG. 1) of data from a single native hierarchy (101 of FIG. 1) includes registering a set of routines for each foreign hierarchy (102, 103 of FIG. 1). The set of routines performs a set of operations on data in the hierarchy associated with a node (e.g., 110a-110f, 130a-130c, of FIG. 1). In response to receiving a user request indicating a particular operation on particular data that does not correspond to a node of the native hierarchy, a first operation on a first set of one or more nodes of a first hierarchy that is not the native hierarchy is determined. A particular routine corresponding to the first operation is invoked from a first set of routines registered for the first hierarchy.<br></td>
