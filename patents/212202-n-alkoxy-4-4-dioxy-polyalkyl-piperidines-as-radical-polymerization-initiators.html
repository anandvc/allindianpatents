N-ALK0Xy-4,4-DI0XY-P0LyALICYL-PIPERIDINES AS RADICAL POLYMERIZATION INITIATORS<br>
The present invention relates to selected glycidyl or carbonyl functional N-alkoxy-4,4-dioxy-polyalkyl-piperidine compounds forming an open chain or cyclic ketal structure, a polymerizabie composition comprising a) at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer and b) a glycidyl or carbonyl functional N-alkoxy-4,4-dioxy-polyalkyl-piperidine nitroxide initiator compound. Further aspects of the present invention are a process for polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers and the use of glycidyl or carbonyl functional N-alkoxy-4,4-dioxy-polyalkyl-piperidine nitroxide initiators for radical polymerization.<br>
The compounds of the present invention provide polymeric resin products having low polydispersity and the polymerization process proceeds with good monomer to polymer conversion efficiency. In particular, this invention relates to stable free radical-mediated polymerization processes which provide homopolymers, random copolymers, block copolymers, multiblock copolymers, graft copolymers and the like, at enhanced rates of polymerization and enhanced monomer to polymer conversions.<br>
US-A-4 581 429 to Solomon et al., issued April 8, 1986. discloses a free radical polymerization process which controls the growth of polymer chains to produce short chain or oligo-meric homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. The process employs an initiator having the formula (in part) R'R-N-0-X, where X is a free radical species capable of polymerizing unsaturated monomers. The reactions typically have low conversion rates. Specifically mentioned radical R'R-N-0« groups are derived from 1,1,3,3 tetraethylisoindoline, 1,1,3,3 tetrapropyiisoindoline. 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine, 2,2,5,5 tetramethylpyrrolidine or di-t-butylamine. However, the suggested compounds do not fulfill all requirements. Particulariy the polymerization of acrylates does not proceed fast enough and/or the monomer to polymer conversion is not as high as desired.<br>
The radical initiators, polymerization processes and resin products of the present invention have an additional glycidyl or carbonyl group, which can be used for further reactions. The resulting resins are useful in many applications.<br><br>
The glycidyl or alkylcarbonyl group of the present initiators remains essentially unchanged during the radical polymerization reaction. Therefore the radical initiators of the present invention offer the possibility, after the radical polymerization is accomplished or stopped, to react the glycidyl group of the oligomers or polymers in a second step with nucleophiles such as alcohols, mercaptanes, amines, metal organic compounds or the like, thereby changing the properties of the oligomers or polymers.<br>
The glycidyl group of the initiators can also be reacted in a first step for example by anionic polymerization in the presence of for example dicyandiamide, butyl-Lithium or other strong bases leading to oligomeric/polymeric radical initiators.<br>
S. Kobatake et al, Macromolecules 1997, 30. 4238-4242 and in WO 97/36894 disclose the anionic polymerization of butadiene in the presence of compound (a) which contains a glycidyl group in a side chain. This compound acts as a terminating reagent for the anionic polymerization of butadiene.<br><br>
The resulting macromolecule can be further used as a macroinitiator for radical polymerization and for preparing block copolymers containing a poylbutadiene segment. Typical copolymers which can be produced are acrylnitriie/butadiene/styrene (ABS) copolymers.<br>
The present invention provides initiators for radical polymerization which contain the glycidyl or alkylcarbonyl group attached to the phenyl group. The initiators show a high reactivity, good rates of polymerization and good monomer to polymer conversions.<br><br>
The remaining glycidyl or carbonyl group is highly reactive towards nucleophiles and can readily be transformed into other chemical groups if desired.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful as terminating agents in the anionic polymerization of for example butadiene as described in WO 97/36894. With the instant compounds termination of anionic polymerization of for example butadiene proceeds fast and complete.<br>
Glycidyl or carbonyl functional alkoxyamines containing a tetramethyl-piperidine group and their use as functionaiized radical initiators/regulators have already been described in WO 99/46261. The instant compounds differ from those disclosed in WO 99/46261 in that they have a ketal structure in 4 position of the piperidine moiety. Such compounds and their use as polymerization initiators/regulators have neither been disclosed as specific compounds nor generically in the prior art.<br>
It has now been found, that amongst those 2,2,6.6-tetraalkylpiperidines described in the prior art those are of particular value which are derivatives of 2,2,6.6 tetramethyl piperidine, 2,2 diethyl-6,6 dimethyl piperidine and of 2,6-diethyl-2,3,6-trimethyl piperidine which are substituted in the 4 position by two oxygen atoms forming an open chain or cyclic ketal structure.<br>
The ketal stnjcture in 4 position ensures high thermal stability which is important for storage, particulariy at elevated temperatures. The ketal structure is themially significantly more • stable compared to the corresponding 4-oxo compound.<br>
The compounds exhibit an unchanged initiating/regulating activity even after storage at elevated temperatures as for example used in conventional stability tests.<br>
Another problem associated with nitroxyl or nitroxyl ether mediated free radical polymerization is the formation of a significant color of the resulting polymer. The compounds of the present invention which have a ketal structure in 4-position impart less color to the polymer compared to other prior art compounds of similar structure.<br><br>
The steric hindrance introduced by the two diethyl groups instead of two methyl groups further leads to an optimized balance in temis of stability of the compounds, initiating activity and control of polymerization.<br>
The particular substitution pattern in 2 and 6 position of the piperidine ring allows high monomer to polymer conversions in short times and low polydispersities which are generally below 2. High monomer to polymer conversions are even achieved with acrylates, such as ethyl- or butyl-acrylate. The temperature necessary to achieve high conversion in short times may be for example as low as 120°C.<br>
The present invention provides compounds useful as initiators/regulators for controlled radical polymerization which in addition have a highly reactive functional group allowing polymer analogous reactions or anionic polymerization termination, which can be adjusted in their initiating/controlling efficiency by adjusting the steric hindrance at the nitrogen atom and which have an excellent storage stability and impart none or only little color to the final polymer.<br><br><br>

Preferred ethylenically unsaturated monomers or oligomers are selected from the group consisting of styrene, substituted styrene, conjugated dienes, acrolein, vinyl acetate, (alkyl)acrylic acidanhydrides, (alkyl)acrylic acid salts, (alkyl)acrylic esters or (alkyl)acrylamides.<br>
Particularly preferred ethylenically unsaturated monomers are styrene. a-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, butadiene, methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, propyjacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert.-butyl acrylate and acrylnitril.<br>
In a most preferred composition the ethylenically unsaturated monomer is styrene.<br>

Examples for C8-C16 ethylenically unsaturated phenolics, which may also be used as comonomers include 4-hydroxy styrene, 4-hydroxy-a-methyl styrene, and 2,6-ditert, butyl, 4-vinyl phenol.<br>
Another class of carboxylic acid monomers suitable for use as comonomers in this invention are the alkali metal and ammonium salts of C4-C6-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids. Suitable examples include maleic acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, fumaric acid and citraconic acid. Maleic anhydride (and itaconic acid are) is the preferred monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid monomer(s).<br>
The acid monomers suitable for use in this invention are in the form of the alkali metal salts or ammonium salts of the acid.<br><br>
The polymerizable composition of the present invention may additionally comprise a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, alcohols, esters, ethers, ketones, amides, sulfoxides, hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons.<br>
The invention also relates to a free radical polymerization process and polymers obtained thereby, which process overcomes many of the problems and disadvantages of the afore mentioned prior art processes.<br>
Preferably the initiator compound is present in an amount of from 0.01 mol-% to 20 mol-% , more preferably in an amount of from 0.01 mol-% to 10 mol-% and most preferred in an amount of from 0.05 mol-% to 10 mol-% based on the monomer or monomer mixture.<br>
When monomer mixtures are used mol-% is calculated on the average molecular weight of the mixture.<br>
Another subject of the present invention is a process for preparing an oligomer, a cooligomer, a polymer or a copolymer (block or random) by free radical polymerization of at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer, which comprises (co)polymerizing the monomer or monomers/oligomers in the presence of an initiator compound of formula la, lla or Ilia under reaction conditions capable of effecting scission of the 0-C bond to form two<br><br><br>
The process may be carried out in the presence of an organic solvent or in the presence of water or in mixtures of organic solvents and water. Additional cosolvents or surfactants, such as glycols or ammonium salts of fatty acids, may be present. Other suitable cosolvents are described hereinafter.<br>
Prefen-ed processes use as little solvents as possible. In the reaction mixture it is preferred to use more than 30% by weight of monomer and initiator, particularly preferably more than 50% and most prefen-ably more than 80%.<br>
If organic solvents are used, suitable solvents or mixtures of solvents are typically pure alkanes (hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane), hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), esters (ethyl acetate, propyl, butyl or hexyl acetate) and ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether), or mixtures thereof.<br>
The aqueous polymerization reactions can be supplemented with a water-miscible or hydrophilic cosolvent to help ensure that the reaction mixture remains a homogeneous single phase throughout the monomer conversion. Any water-soluble or water-miscible cosolvent may be used, as long as the aqueous solvent medium is effective in providing a solvent system which prevents precipitation or phase separation of the reactants or polymer products until after all polymerization reactions have been completed. Exemplary cosolvents useful in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyn-olidines, N-alkyI pyn-olidinones, N-alkyI pyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, carboxylic acids and salts thereof, esters, organosulfides, sulfoxides, sulfones, alcohol derivatives, hydroxyether derivatives such as butyl carbitol or cellosolve, amino alcohols, ketones, and the like, as well as derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof. Specific examples include methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, dipropylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, and other water-soluble or water-miscible materials, and mixtures thereof. When mixtures of water and water-soluble or water-miscible organic liquids are selected as the aqueous reaction media, the water to cosolvent weight ratio is typically in the range of about 100:0 to about 10:90.<br>
When monomer mixtures or monomer/oligomer mixtures are used, the calculation of mol-% is based on an average molecular weight of the mixture.<br><br>
Hydrophilic monomers, polymers and copolymers of the present invention can be separated from one another or from the polymerization reaction mixture by, for example, changing the pH of the reaction media and by other well known conventional separation techniques.<br>
The polymerization temperature may range from about 50°C to about 180°C, preferably from about 80°C to about 150°C. At temperatures above about 180°G, the controlled conversion of the monomer into polymer decreases, and uncertain and undesirable by-products like thermally initiated polymer are formed or destruction of the polymerization regulator may occur. Frequently, these by-products discolor the polymer mixture and a purification step may be required to remove them, or they may be intractable.<br>
Therefore high reactivity of the present initiators which are already active at relatively low temperatures leads to short reaction times. The resulting polymers are usually colouriess and they can be used in most cases without any further purification step. This is an important advantage when industrial scale-up is considered.<br>
After the polymerizing step is complete, the formed (co)polymer obtained is isolated. The isolating step of the present process is conducted by known procedures, e.g. by distilling off the unreacted monomer or by precipitation in a suitable nonsolvent, filtering the precipitated polymer followed by washing and drying the polymer.<br>
Furthermore, block copolymers of this invention, wherein the blocks alternate between polar monomers and non-polar monomers, are useful in many applications as amphiphilic surfactants or dispersants for preparing highly uniform polymer blends.<br>
The (co)polymers of the present invention may have a number average molecular weight from 1 000 to 400 000 g/mol, preferably from 2 000 to 250 000 g/mol and, more preferably, from 2 000 to 200 000 g/mo1. When produced in bulk, the number average molecular weight may be up to 500 000 (with the same minimum weights as mentioned above). The number average molecular weight may be determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) or, if the initiator carries a group which can be easily distinguished from the monomer(s), by NMR spectroscopy or other conventional methods.<br>
Thus, the present invention also encompasses in the synthesis novel block, multi-block, star, gradient, random, hyperbranched and dendritic copolymers, as welf as graft or copolymers.<br><br>
The polymers prepared by the present invention are useful for example in following applications:<br>
adhesives. detergents, dispersants, emulsifiers, surfactants, defoamers, adhesion promoters, corrosion inhibitors, viscosity improvers, lubricants, rheology modifiers, impact modifiers, thickeners, crosslinkers, paper treatment, water treatment, electronic materials, paints, coatings, photography, ink materials, imaging materials, superabsorbants, cosmetics, hair products, preservatives, biocide materials or modifiers for asphalt, leather, textiles, ceramics and wood.<br>
Because the present polymerizaton is a -living- polymerization, it can be started and stopped practically at will. Furthermore, the polymer product retains the functional alkoxyamine group allowing a continuation of the polymerization in a living matter. Thus, in one embodiment of this invention, once the first monomer is consumed in the initial polymerizing step a second monomer can then be added to form a second block on the growing polymer chain in a second polymerization step. Therefore it is possible to carry out additional polymerizations with the same or different monomer(s) to prepare multi-block copolymers. Furthermore, since this is a radical polymerization, blocks can be prepared in essentially any order. One is not necessarily restricted to preparing block copolymers where the sequential polymerizing steps must flow from the least stabilized polymer intermediate to the most stabilized polymer intermediate, such as is the case in ionic polymerization. Thus it is possible to prepare a multi-block copolymer in which a polyacrylonitrile or a poly(meth)-acrylate block is prepared first, then a styrene or butadiene block is attached thereto, and so on.<br>
Furthermore, there is no linking group required for joining the different blocks of the present block copolymer. One can simply add successive monomers to form successive blocks.<br>
A plurality of specifically designed polymers and copolymers are accessible by the present invention, such as star and graft (co)polymers as described, inter alia, by C. J. Hawker in Angew. Chemie, 1995, 107, pages 1623-1627, dendrimers as described by K. Matyaszewski et al. in Macromolecules 1996, Vol 29, No. 12, pages 4167-4171, graft (co)polymers as described by C. J. Hawker et al. in Macromol. Chem. Phys. 198, 155-166(1997), random copolymers as described by C. J. Hawker in Macromolecules 1996, 29, 2686-2688, or<br><br><br>
Also subject of the invention is the use of a compound of formula la, ila or Ilia for terminating the anionic polymerization of a diene or vinyl monomer.<br>
When the compounds are used for such termination reactions they are usually used in an  -equimolar amount or in excess to the initiating base, such as for example sec. butyl-litium.<br>
The preparation of the compounds of the present invention is carried out according to known reaction steps.
