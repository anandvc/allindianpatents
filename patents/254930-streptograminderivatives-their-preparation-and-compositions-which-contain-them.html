				<td>The present invention relates to group A streptogramin derivatives of general formula:<br><br>
which have particularly advantageous antibacterial activity.<br>
Among the known streptogramins, pristinamycin (RP 7293), an antibacterial agent of natural origin produced by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis,   was isolated for the first time in 1955. The pristinamycin sold under the name Pyostacine® consists mainly of pristinamycin IIA combined with pristinamycin IA.<br>
Another antibacterial agent of the streptogramin class, virginiamycin, was isolated from Streptomyces virgxniae,   ATCC 13161 [Antibiotics and Chemotherapy, 5, 632 (1955) ] . Virginiamycin (Staphylomycine®) consists mainly of factor M1 (VM1) combined with factor S (VS).<br><br>
F. Le Goffic et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem.-Chimica Therapeutica, 16(1), 69-72 (1981) have disclosed the preparation of dihydroxy derivatives of pristinamycin IIA.<br>
Patent application GB-A-2 206 879 discloses modified group A streptogramin derivatives of structure:<br><br>
however, these derivatives show no activity orally.<br>
It has now been found that the group A streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) in which:<br>
-	R1  represents alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radicals<br>
which may be mono- or polyfluoro radicals, or<br>
cycloalkyl radicals containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
phenylmethyl radicals or heterocyclylmethyl radicals<br>
in which the heterocyclyl portion is aromatic,<br>
-	R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl<br>
radical, and<br>
-	the bond ---represents a single bond (27R stereo<br>
chemistry) or a double bond,<br><br>
the alkyl radicals containing 1 to 6 carbons in a straight or branched chain and the alkenyl and/or alkynyl radicals containing 3 to 6 carbons in a straight or branched chain, have particularly advantageous antibacterial activity, alone or combined with a group B streptogramin derivative.<br>
According to the invention, when R2 is a heterocyclylmethyl radical, the heterocyclyl radical is advantageously chosen from pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl and pyridyl.<br>
According to the invention, when R1 is alkyl mono- or polysubstituted with a fluorine atom, the alkyl radical preferably contains 1 or 2 carbon atoms; when R1 represents alkenyl, it preferably represents allyl, and when it represents alkynyl, it preferably represents propargyl.<br>
The streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) may be prepared by the action of a derivative of general formula:<br><br>
for which R1 is defined as above and X represents a halogen atom or a methylsulphonyloxy, p-toluene-sulphonyloxy or trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy radical, in<br><br>
the presence of a phase-transfer agent, on a dibydroxy derivative of the streptogramin of general formula:<br><br>
in which R2 is defined as above, the bond	represents<br>
a single bond (27R stereochemistry) or a double bond, and for which derivative the hydroxyl function in position 14 and/or the amide function in position 8 have been optionally protected beforehand, followed, where appropriate, by removal of the protecting radical(s).<br>
Preferably, when X is a halogen atom, a derivative of general formula (Ila) for which X is a bromine or iodine atom is reacted.<br>
The phase-transfer agent is advantageously chosen from quaternary ammonium derivatives (for example salts of tetraalkylammonium or trialkylbenzyl-ammonium such as the chloride, bromide or sulphate) .<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in basic medium, for example in the presence of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or in the presence of potassium carbonate or caesium carbonate, at a temperature of<br><br>
between 10°C and 60°C, in aqueous-organic medium, for example in a hydrocarbon (for example toluene), a halogenated solvent (for example dichloromethane) or an ester (in particular ethyl acetate). The process is preferably performed at about 20°C. Preferably also, the process is performed in the presence of an excess of the derivative of general formula (Ila).<br>
The protection and deprotection of the hydroxyl radical in position 14 or of the amide radical in position 8 are carried out according to the usual methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, in particular by applying the methods described by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (2nd edition), A. Wiley - Interscience Publication (1991) or by Mc Omie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press (1973). For example, the protection of the hydroxyl radical is carried out with an allyl radical which is installed and removed by analogy with the methods described below in the examples. The protection of the amide may be carried out in particular with the t-butoxycarbonyl radical.<br>
When the reaction leads to a mixture of the 14- and 16-0-alkyl isomers, these isomers may be separated according to the usual methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, in particular by chromatography [high performance liquid chromatography<br><br>
(HPLC) on a normal or reverse phase, on a chiral or non-chiral phase, or by flash chromatography] or by crystallization.<br>
According to the invention, the streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) may also be prepared by desilylation and then 37-O-alkylation using a derivative of general formula (Ila), of a silyl and 14-0-allyl derivative of general formula:<br><br>
in which R2 is defined as above, the bond	represents<br>
a single bond (27R stereochemistry) or a double bond, and the radical R3 represents a protecting radical and R4 represents a silyl radical, followed by removal of the allyl radical and the protecting radical R3 according to the known methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule.<br>
The protecting radical R3 is advantageously t-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
The silyl radical R4 may be chosen in particular from trialkylsilyl, dialkylphenylsilyl and<br><br>
alkyldiphenylsilyl (for example t-butyldiphenylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl).<br>
The desilylation is carried out according to the usual methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule. The process is performed in particular in the presence of a source of fluoride ions such as tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride or a hydrofluoric acid/amine complex, the amine possibly being, for example, triethylamine or pyridine. The reaction is carried out in a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane) or in an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran) at a temperature of between 20°C and 80°C.<br>
The 37-O-alkylation reaction is carried out by the action of a derivative of general formula (Ila) as defined above, on the desilylated streptogramin of general formula (III). Preferably, the process is performed under an inert atmosphere (for example under nitrogen or argon) in basic medium, for example in the presence of sodium hydride, alkali metal (lithium, sodium or potassium) hexamethyldisilylamide or in the presence of an organolithium reagent (for example n-butyllithium) or alternatively in the presence of an amide (for example lithium diisopropylamide) , in an inert solvent such as an amide (for example dimethyl-formamide) or an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran) , at a temperature of between -20°C and 60°C.<br><br>
The removal of the allyl radical is carried out, for example, in the presence of a proton donor such as 4-methylphenylsulphinic acid, in the presence of a palladium catalyst (for example tetrakis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium) , in a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane), at a temperature of between 0°C and 60°C. It is also possible to perform the process according to the methods described in the references cited above. The t-butoxycarbonyl radical is removed according to the methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, in particular in a solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide or diphenyl ether, at a temperature of between 130°C and 170°C.<br>
The streptogramin derivative of general formula (III) may be prepared by 36-O-allylation and then 37-O-silylation and protection of the amide in position 8 with a radical R3.<br>
The allylation is carried out according to<br>
the usual methods as cited in the above references. In<br>
particular, it is carried out by the action of an allyl<br>
halide (preferably bromide) or of a methylsulphonyloxy,<br>
p-toluenesulphonyloxy or trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy<br>
derivative in the presence of a base such as a<br>
carbonate (in particular potassium carbonate or caesium<br>
carbonate), in a solvent such as a ketone (for example<br><br><br>
methyl ethyl ketone), a nitrile (for example acetonitrile) or a hydrocarbon (in particular toluene), at a temperature of between 40°C and 80°C, preferably 70°C.<br>
The silylation is carried out according to the methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, in particular using a halide (preferably a chloride) of the silyl radical R4. For example, the process is performed using trialkylsilyl chloride, dialkylphenylsilyl chloride or alkyldiphenylsilyl chloride (for example t-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride or t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride), working in a solvent such as a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloro-methane) , an amide (for example dimethylformamide) , an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran) or a nitrile (for example acetonitrile) , at a temperature of between 0°C and 60°C, and preferably at room temperature.<br>
The installation of the protecting radical R3 is carried out according to the methods mentioned above. For example, it is carried out in the presence of an excess of di-t-butyl dicarbonate, a base (triethylamine or pyridine) and optionally a catalyst such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine, in a chlorinated solvent (dichloromethane) or an ether (tetrahydrofuran) at a temperature of between 0°C and 80°C.<br><br>
The dihydroxylated group A streptogramin derivative of general formula (II) may be obtained by selective reduction of the natural pristinamycin component of general formula:<br><br>
in which R2 is defined as above and the bond	<br>
represents a single bond (27R stereochemistry) or a double bond, followed by separation of the 16S epimer form.<br>
The reduction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a reducing agent such as an alkali metal borohydride, for example sodium borohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, in an organic solvent chosen from chlorinated solvents (for example dichloro-methane, dichloroethane or chloroform), tetrahydro-furan, acetic acid and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or 2-propanol, at a temperature of between -78°C and 40°C.<br>
The separation of the 16R epimer form and of<br>
the 16S epimer form is carried out according to the<br>
11<br><br>
usual methods; for example, the separation of the epimer forms may be carried out by chromatography, flash chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), on a chiral or non-chiral phase, or centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), starting with the mixture of the 16R and 16S epimers. Alternatively, the separation may be carried out by crystallization.<br>
The pristinamycin derivatives of general formula (IV) correspond, respectively, to pristinamycin IIA (PIIA) , pristinamycin IIB (PUB) , pristinamycin IIC (PIIC) , pristinamycin I ID (PIID), pristinamycin IIF (PIIF) and pristinamycin IIG (PIIG), which are known components of natural pristinamycin. The components PIIF and PIIG have been disclosed in European patent EP-A-0 614 910- Pristinamycin IIC (PIIC) and pristinamycin IID (PIID) may be obtained as described by J.C. Barriere et al. , Expert- Opin. Invest. Drugs, 3(2), 115-31 (1994).<br>
The pristinamycin derivatives of general formula (III) are novel products.<br>
The preparation and separation of the natural group A streptogramin components [streptogramins of general formula (IV)] is carried out by fermentation and isolation of the constituents from the fermentation must according to or by analogy with the method described by J. Preud'homme et al. , Bull. Soc. Chim,<br><br>
Fr., vol. 2, 585 (1968) or in European patent EP-A-0 614 910. Alternatively, the preparation of the natural group A components may be carried out by specific fermentation, as disclosed in patent application FR-A-2 689 518.<br>
The streptogramin derivatives of general formula (I) may be purified, where appropriate, by physical methods such as crystallization, chromatography or CPC.<br>
The streptogramin derivatives according to the present invention have antibacterial properties and synergistic properties with respect to the antibacterial activity of the group B streptogramin derivatives- They are particularly advantageous on account of their powerful activity alone or in combination.<br>
When they are combined with a group B<br>
streptogramin component or derivative, this component<br>
or derivative may be chosen, depending on whether it is<br>
desired to obtain a form for oral or parenteral<br>
administration, from the following natural components:<br>
