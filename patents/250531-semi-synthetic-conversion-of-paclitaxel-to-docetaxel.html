SEMI-SYNTHETIC CONVERSION OF PACLITAXEL TO DOCETAXEL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a semi-synthesis of taxane derivatives useful in the preparation of docetaxel, from pure or crude paclitaxel or related taxane starting material, in particular, the semi-synthesis of protected taxane derivatives in a one pot reaction and its conversion to docetaxel.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The taxane family of terpenes has received much attention in the scientific and medical community because the members of this family have demonstrated broad spectrum anti-leukemic and tumor-inhibitory activity. Docetaxel (1, Taxotere), a semi-synthetic analog, and paclitaxel (2, Taxol), a complex diterpene isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia) are arguably the most outstanding cancer chemotherapeutic substances discovered in recent times. For example, paclitaxel has been found to have activity against different forms of leukemia and against solid tumors in the breast, ovary, brain, and lung in humans. While paclitaxel can be obtained from the yew tree or semi-synthetically, only the latter option is currently available for the formation of non-natural docetaxel. The partial synthesis of this important compound has generally been accomplished through esterification of a derivative of the (2R, 3S) phenylisoserine side chain with a protected form of 10-deacetylbaccatin III, a comparatively abundant natural product also present in the yew tree.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br><br>
TAXOL, (2)<br>
As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,814,470, taxotere has been found to have very good anti-tumor activity and better bio-availability than paclitaxel. Taxotere is similar in structure to paclitaxel, having t-butoxycarbonyl instead of benzoyl on the amino group at the 3' position, and a hydroxy group instead of the acetoxy group at the C-10 position.<br>
Docetaxel and paclitaxel may be prepared semi-synthetically from 10-deacetylbaccatin III or baccatin III as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,924,011 and 4,924,012, by the reaction of a p-lactam and a suitably protected 10-deacetylbaccatin III or baccatin III derivative as set forth in U.S. Pat. No.5,175,315, by a method using an oxazoline compound as set forth in International Patent Kokai No. Hei 7-504444, by a method using thioester compound as set forth in International Patent Kokai No. Hei 10-505360 or by a method using cinnamic acid as set forth in Tetrahedron, Vol. 42, p.4451,1986, etc. 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB, 3) and Baccatin III (4) can be separated from mixtures extracted from natural sources such as the needles, stems, bark or heartwood of numerous Taxus species and have the following structures.<br><br>
Although much of the research towards the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel and taxotere has involved 10-deacetylbaccatin HI as the starting<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>

material, other taxanes from the Taxus species, such as 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III (9-DHB, 5), present in the Canadian yew (Taxus Canadensis), cephalomannine (6), 10-deacetyl taxol (10-DAT, 7), 7-xylosyl taxol (8), 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol (9) and a number of 7-epi-taxanes have been collected and identified.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br><br>
As disclosed in U.S. Pat. Application No. 10/695,416, which application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, docetaxel and paclitaxel may also be prepared semi-synthetically from 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III.<br>
However, the above methods thus far developed involve subjects such as reaction under the conditions of extremely low temperatures, generation of diastereomers, use of asymmetry controlling agents, and the reaction under strongly alkaline conditions, which cause problems upon the industrialization thereof.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need for new and improved processes for the preparation of taxane derivatives and their conversion to docetaxel, and also for the preparation of such taxane intermediates from crude and partially purified mixtures comprising a plurality of taxanes. The present invention addresses these needs and provides further related advantages.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a simple process for conversion of paclitaxel or a paclitaxel-containing material to its synthetic analog - docetaxel. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention provides a process for<br>

wherein, R1 is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl; and X, Y and Z are the same or different and independently hydroxy or protected hydiroxy, the process comprising: protecting one or more hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions of the taxane; introducing a t-Boc group at the nitrogen of the amide group at the C-3' position of the taxane to provide a protected paclitaxel derivative having an urea linkage at the C-3' position; selectively removing the -C(O)R1 group from the urea linkage to provide a protected docetaxel; and converting the protected docetaxel to docetaxel by removing the hydroxy-protecting groups at the C-21, C-7 and C-10 positions, wherein the step of protecting one or more hydroxy groups at C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions, and introducing the t-Boc group at the nitrogen site of the amide group of the taxane comprises combining, in a one pot reaction, the taxane of Formula (I) with a hydroxy protecting agent and a t-Boc agent, and wherein the step of selectively removing the -C(O)R1 group comprises subjecting the protected paclitaxel derivative having the urea linkage to a first base.<br>
In another embodiment, the hydroxy protecting groups at the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions can be the same or different.<br>
In another embodiment, the step of protecting one or more hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions of the taxane is carried out in the presence of a second base.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the step of protecting one or more hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions of the taxane is carried out in the presence of an acid.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a simplified and efficient process for preparing docetaxel from an initial mixture of taxanes, wherein the<br>

WO2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
initial mixture comprises paclitaxel and at least one additional taxane selected from the group of 10-deacetylbaccatin III, 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-deacetyltaxol, 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyltaxol, the process comprising the steps of: protecting the hydroxy groups at the C-2' and C-7 positions of paclitaxel; introducing a t-Boc group at the nitrogen of the amide group at the C-3' position of paclitaxel to provide a protected paclitaxel derivative having an urea linkage at the C-3' position; selectively removing the benzoyl group from the urea linkage to provide a protected docetaxel; and converting the protected docetaxel to docetaxel by removing the hydroxy-protecting groups at the C-7, C-2' and C-10 positions, wherein the step of protecting the hydroxy groups at C-2' and C-7 positions, and introducing a t-Boc group at the nitrogen site of the amide group of paclitaxel are carried out in a one pot reaction wherein the mixture containing paclitaxel is combined with a hydroxy protecting agent and a t-Boc agent; and wherein the step of selectively removing the benzoyl group comprises subjecting the protected paclitaxel derivative having the urea linkage to a first base.<br>
In another embodiment, the step of protecting the hydroxy group at the C-2' and C-7 position of paclitaxel further comprises protecting one or more hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions of each taxane in the initial mixture having a hydroxy group at these positions.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a process of converting a taxane of Formula (I)<br><br>
wherein, R1 is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl, and X, Y and Z are the same or different and independently hydroxy or protected hydroxy, to docetaxel, via a primary amine<br>

WO2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
intermediate. The process comprises: introducing a nitroso group (-NO) at the nitrogen of the amide group at the C-3' position of the taxane to provide a N-nitrosoamide intermediate; hydrolyzing the N-nitrosoamide intermediate to provide a N-nitrosoamine intermediate; reducing the N-nitrosoamine intermediate to provide a primary amine intermediate; and converting the primary amine derivative to docetaxel,<br>

The reaction intermediate generated is not isolated but serves directly as a reactant in a next step of reaction. For example, in one embodiment of the instant invention, one or more free hydroxy groups of a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel) are protected, the protected taxane intermediate is not isolated<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
and is used directly in a next step of N-acylation whereby a t-butoxycarbonyl (t-Boc) group is attached to the nitrogen of the amide group at the C-3' position.<br>
II. Process for protecting a paclitaxel or a related taxane thereof<br>
As noted above, the present invention relates to a semi-synthesis of paclitaxel derivatives useful in the preparation of docetaxel. In particular, one embodiment of the present invention provides a process comprising protecting one or more of the free hydroxy groups at any of the C-7, C-10 and C-2' positions, and introducing a t-Boc group at the nitrogen of the amide group at the C-3' position of a compound of Formula (I) to provide a protected paclitaxel derivative having an urea linkage therein. One embodiiment provides a process of protecting the hydroxy group(s) and introducing the t-Boc group, the process comprising, in one reaction vessel, combining a compound of Formula (I) with a base, a hydroxy protecting agent and a t-Boc agent. The phrase "t-Boc agent" as used herein refers to a reagent that introduces a t-Boc group to the nitrogen of the amide group at the C-3' position, in other words, the t-Boc agent further acylates the nitrogen of the amide group. Suitable "t-Boc agent" can be the same as those hydroxy protecting agents having a t-Boc moiety, for example, BoC2O. The t-Boc agent is selected to react with the amide group in the presence of a base after the reactive hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 positions have been protected. Reaction Scheme 1 is shown below to illustrate this process:<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
REACTION SCHEME 1<br><br>
wherein,<br>
R1 is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl;<br>
R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and independently a hydroxy protecting group; and<br>
X, Y and Z are the same or different and independently hydroxy or protected hydroxy.<br>
The protecting step provides protection to one or more reactive hydroxy groups in a compound of Formula (I). In one embodiment, when X and Z are free hydroxy groups, as in paclitaxel (2) orcephalomannine (6), the protection step comprises protecting the hydroxy groups at both the C-7 and C-2' positions. In another embodiment, X, Y and Z are all free hydroxy groups, as in 10-DAT (7), the protection step comprises protecting all three hydroxy groups at C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions. In yet another embodiment, X and Y are free hydroxy, and Z is already a protected hydroxy, as in 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol (9), the protection step comprises protecting the free hydroxy groups at C-2' and C-10 positions.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
In one embodiment, the same hydroxy protecting agent is used to protect all the available reactive hydroxy groups. In another embodiment, different hydroxy protecting agents can be used to protect the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 positions. Typically, the free hydroxy group at the C-2' position is more reactive than the hydroxy group at the C-7, which is in turn more reactive than the hydroxy group at the C-10 positions. This leads to the preferential protection whereby the hydroxy group at C-2' will be protected first, followed by those at the C-7 and C-10 positions. Thus, it is possible that the hydroxy protecting step comprises sequential steps of protecting the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions, with a different protecting agent for each step. For example, C-2' can be protected, using about one equivalent of a first hydroxy protecting agent, followed by the protection of the C-7 position using a second hydroxy protecting agent and, if necessary, followed by the protection of the C-10 position using a third protecting agent. The reaction can be carried out in the same reaction vessel without isolating any of the protected intermediates.<br>
In a further embodiment, it is possible that the hydroxy protecting agent is the same as the t-Boc agent. For example, BoC2O can be employed as a hydroxy protecting agent to protect, where appropriate, one or more of the reactive hydroxy groups at any of the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions. After the protection is completed, without isolating the protected taxane intermediate, BoC2O can be used to introduce a t-Boc group to the nitrogen of the amide group at the C-3' position in the presence of a base.<br>
The foregoing steps of protecting hydroxy groups and introducing the t-Boc group are further described below in details.<br>
General method of protection<br>
The hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 positions of a taxane of Formula (I) can be selectively protected using any of a variety of hydroxy protecting agents, such as silylating, acylating, alkylating agents and those agents forming acetal and ketal with the hydroxy group. The hydroxy protecting step can<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
be carried out in the presence of a base or an acid, depending on the hydroxy protecting agent(s) used.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides the protection of one or more hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 in the presence of a base. Formula (I) is:<br><br>
wherein,<br>
R1 is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl; and<br>
X, Y and Z are the same or different and independently hydroxy or protected hydroxy.<br>
In particular, the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 hydroxy group may be silylated using any of a variety of common silylating agents including, but not limited to, tri(hydrocarbonyl)silyl halides and tri(hydrocarbonyl)silyl triflates. The hydrocarbonyl moieties of these compounds may be optionally substituted and preferably are substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl. Representative silylating agents include, tribenzylsilyl chloride, trimethylsilyl chloride, triethylsilyl chloride, dimethylisopropylsilyl chloride, dimethylphenylsilyl chloride and the like.<br>
Alternatively, selective acylation of the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 hydroxy group can be achieved using any of a variety of common acylating agents, but not limited to substituted and unsubstituted carboxylic acid derivatives, e.g., carboxylic acid halides, anhydrides, dicarbonates, isocyanates and haloformates. Representative acylating agents include, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc2O), dibenzyl dicarbonate, diallyl dicarbonate, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate, benzyl chloroformate, dichloroacetyl chloride, acetyl chloride or another common acylating agent.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
Alternatively, selective alkylation of the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 hydroxy group can be achieved using any of a variety of common alkylating agents, such as benzyl chloride and benzyl bromide.<br>
According to the present invention, the protecting step is carried out in the presence of a base, such as, for example, DMAP, pyridine, TEA, LiOH, Li-t-OBu, n-BuLi, LiH, LiHMDS, KHMDS, K-t-OBu, NaH, NaHMDS, Na-t-OBu and mixtures of any two or more of the foregoing, such as a mixture of n-BuLi/Li-t-OBu, and the hydroxy-protecting group is an alkylating agent, silylating agent or acylating agent.<br>
Exemplary reaction conditions are as follows: a taxane of Formula (I), or a mixture of taxanes, is dissolved in an organic solvent, such as anhydrous DCM (dichloromethane) orTHF (tetrahydrofuran) or DMF (dimethyl formamide) or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) or acetonitrile under an argon atmosphere at low to around room temperature. To this solution is added DMAP (dimethylaminopyridine) or any of the lithium, sodium or potassium base, such as Li-t-OBu, K-t-OBu, n-BuLi, a mixture of n-BuLi/K-t-OBu or LiOH, followed by an hydroxy protecting agent, such as an acylating agent (e.g., di-tert-butyl dicarbonate), or an silylating agent (e.g., triethyl silyl chloride) or any other hydroxy-protecting agents as described herein. The mixture is left at low to around room temperature until complete consumption of the starting material, as visualized by TLC to afford a C-7, C-2' and/or C-10 protected taxane or a mixture of C-7, C-21 and/or C-10 protected taxanes. "Low temperature" as used herein refers to temperature between -78"C to room temperature.<br>
As noted above, the protecting step can be carried out using the same hydroxy protecting agent for all the available reactive hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 positions, or using different hydroxy protecting agent for each of the hydroxy groups to be protected. In light of the different reactivities of the hydroxy groups at the C-2, C-7 and C-10 positions as described above, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that by controlling the equivalency of a<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
hydroxy protecting agent in each step, C-2\ C-7 and/or C-10 can be protected by different hydroxy protecting groups.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides the protection of one or more hydroxy groups at the C-2', C-7 and/or C-10 in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid. Formula (I) is:<br><br>
wherein,<br>
R1 is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl; and<br>
X, Y and Z are the same or different and independently hydroxy or protected hydroxy.<br>
In particular, the C-2' C-7 and/or C-10 hydroxy group may be alkylated with an alkylating agent such as ethyl vinyl ether and methoxymethyl chloride. Suitable acid includes r-toluenesulfonic acid and other protic acid. Protic acid refers to an acid that yields an H+ ion. Only catalytic amount of the acid is needed to initiate the protecting step. Typically, less than 1 equivalent of the acid is used, more typically, less than 0.5 equivalent of the acid is used, more typically, less than 0.2 equivalent of the acid is used.<br>
It is possible that one hydroxy group is protected in the presence of an acid, while the others are protected in the presence of a base. For example, C-2' paclitaxel can be first protected using about one equivalent of ethyl vinyl ether in the presence of a catalytic amount of r-toluenesulfonic acid. Without isolating the C-2' protected paclitaxel (i.e., 2'-OEE paclitaxel), a base and another hydroxy protecting agent are added. Advantageously, the amount of the base used is selected with the expectation that some of it will be consumed by the acid that might still be present in the reaction mixture. In any event, one skilled in the art will<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
readily appreciate that all the reactive hydroxy groups of a taxane of Formula (I) are to be protected by the same or different hydroxy protecting groups.<br>
Following protection of the hydroxy groups at the C-7, C-2' and/or C-10 positions of a taxane using the foregoing process, the introduction of a t-Boc group at the nitrogen of the amide group of the taxane may be performed in the same vessel without isolating the product of the hydroxy-protecting step according to the following method.<br>
General Method of Introducing t-BOC at the nitrogen of the amide group<br>
The introduction of a tert-butoxycarbonyl (t-Boc) to the above protected taxane is also referred herein as a N-acyiation step, whereby a t-Boc group replaces the hydrogen of the -NHC(O)R1 group to provide a taxane intermediate having an urea linkage at the C-3' position, as represented by Formula (II) in Reaction Scheme 1. According to the present invention, the N-acylation step is carried out in a combined step by adding to the hydroxy-protected taxane in the same reaction vessel, a base and a t-Boc agent. Representative bases include DMAP, TEA, LiOH, n-BuLi, LiH, LiHMDS, KHMDS, NaH, NaHMDS or a mixture of any two or more of the foregoing. In addition, the combined step may further comprise combining the taxane with a metal alkoxide, wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of Group I, II and III metals and transition metals. Representative metal alkoxide includes, but is not limited to Li-t-Bu, Na-t-Bu and K-t-Bu. Representative t-Boc agent includes, but is not limited to, Boc2O.<br>
An exemplary reaction condition for introducing the t-Boc group includes, dissolving a C-7, C-2' and/or C-10 protected taxane or a mixture of C-7, C-2' and/or C-10 protected taxanes in an organic solvent under an argon atmosphere at low to around room temperature. To this solution is added a base, such as DMAP, TEA, LiOH, Li-t-OBu, n-BuLi, LiH, LiHMDS, KHMDS, K-t-OBu, NaH, NaHMDS, Na-t-Bu or a mixture of any two or more of the foregoing, followed by addition of a t-Boc agent. The mixture is left to react at low to room<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
temperature until complete consumption of the starting material, as visualized by TLC. A solution of an acid, such as AcOH, in an organic solvent is added to the mixture, and the mixture is partitioned between saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and mixtures of DCM and ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts are dried and evaporated to give the crude protected taxane derivative, which can be further purified by column chromatography or crystallized from a suitable solvent.<br>
III. Taxane Starting Material<br>
As noted above, the processes of the present invention may be utilized to convert taxanes of Formula (I), and mixtures of taxanes, into protected taxane derivatives as represented by Formula (II), which can then be used to further synthesize docetaxel. Representative taxanes of Formula (I) include paclitaxel (2), cephalomannine (6), 10-cleacetyltaxol (7), 7-xylosyl taxol (8) and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol (9). However, other taxanes may also be present in the taxane starting material without affecting the conversion of Formula (I) to Formula (III), as illustrated in Reaction Scheme 1. For example, in addition to one or more taxanes of Formula (I), other taxanes from a crude taxane extract or in a waste taxane solution may also be present in the starting material. These taxanes are a plurality of compounds of a generic tetracyclic baccatin molecular framework as represented by Formula (IV):<br><br>
wherein RA, RB, RC and RD represent substituents which vary between the taxanes. More specifically, RA is -OH, RB is -OH or -OAc, Rc is =0, and RD is -OH or xylosyl. For example, when RA is -OH, RB is -OH, Rc is =0 and RD is -OH, the foregoing structure represents 10 deacetylbaccatin III (3), and when RA is -OH,<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
RB is -OAc, Rc is =0 and RD is -OH, the foregoing structure represents baccatin III (4), when RA is -OAc, RB is -OAc, Rc is -OH, and RD is -OH, the forgoing structure represents 9-DHB (5).<br>
It is desirable to adjust the amounts of the base and hydroxy protecting in order to fully protect all the reactive hydroxy groups in the taxane starting material before the introduction of the t-Boc group to the nitrogen of the amide group. It can be readily appreciated by one skilled in the art that, in doing so, the t-Boc agent for acylating the amide group is less likely to be consumed by any reactive free hydroxy group.<br>
In certain embodiments, thetaxanes utilized in the processes of the present invention may be pure, purified or partially purified taxanes. Such purified and partially purified taxanes may be obtained by any of a number of different methods well known in the art. For example, paclitaxel can be obtained by the methods described in U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989 to Foo et al. and references incorporated therein.<br>
In other embodiments, the mixture of taxane utilized in the processes of the present invention may be a plurality of taxanes present in a crude taxane extract or in a waste taxane solution or from synthesis. In this way, the disclosed processes may be utilized for high yield and large scale conversion of taxanes present in a waste taxane solution into protected taxane derivatives, which can be used to further synthesize docetaxel. Such waste taxane solutions may comprise (1) pooled waste stream fractions collected following the chromatographic separation and collection of paclitaxel enriched fractions from a crude or partially purified taxane extract, and/or (2) pooled waste mother liquors collected following the recrystallization of a crude or partially purified taxane extract of paclitaxel.<br>
Representative waste taxane solutions may be obtained by a number of different methods, such as, for example, the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989 to Foo et al., and other references cited therein, which patent is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/831,648, which application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A representative method of obtaining a waste taxane solution, which comprises pooled waste stream fractions, comprises the following extraction and column chromatography steps.<br>
Preparation of the Taxane-Containing Material<br>
A suitable taxane-containing material is any tissue that contains a high taxane content. Examples of suitable taxane-containing material include tissues from various species of Yew plants comprising the genus Taxus, most preferably the roots and needles of ornamental Yew plants such as T. canadensis, T. x media spp Hicksii, T. x dark green spreader and Hill., T. chinensis, T. wallichiana, T. cuspidata, T. globosa, T. sumatrana, T. mare/and T. floridana, and the bark of T. brevifolia or T. yunnanensis. Other suitable material include cultures of plant tissues obtained from a Taxus species.<br>
In a typical practice, such as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,139,989, the taxane-containing material is either pulverized, chipped or otherwise ground into small pieces so as to increase efficiency of a solvent extraction. The taxane-containing material may also optionally be dried. Taxane-containing cell culture, cells, microorganisms and fermentation broths will typically be concentrated prior to solvent extraction. Cells and microorganisms can be processed as whole cells or cell paste or pulver.<br>
Extraction<br>
The taxane-containing material may be initially extracted by contacting the material with an organic solvent, usually for a prolonged period of at least 8 hours and typically for about 3 days with or without physical agitation to promote formation of a crude organic extract containing a plurality of taxanes. The extraction may employ any of the solvent systems that are known to be used for the extraction of paclitaxel, including but not limited to, acetone, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, chloroform, mixtures thereof, and mixtures containing an aqueous component of up to 60%. These solvents are typically<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
added in an amount of about 4-20 liter per kg of the taxane-containing material to prepare the crude organic extract. Reference is made for example, to U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989 and the publications cited therein which provide a non-exclusive description of several solvent systems that may be used to prepare an organic extract containing a plurality of taxanes.<br>
In one embodiment, the organic solvent is a polar organic solvent, typically an alcohol. For some embodiments, methanol is preferred because of its low cost, ease of removal and efficiency of taxane extraction. In one embodiment, about 6-15 liters of methanol is added for every kg of taxane-containing material to be extracted. The extraction is accelerated by agitating the taxane-containing material, for example, by stirring or percolating the methanol with the taxane-containing material for about 1-5 days at a temperature between room temperature and about 60°C, most typically at about 40°C. When the taxane-containing material contains a paclitaxel content of at least 0.005%, methanol extraction for three days as described above recovers at least 90% of the available paclitaxel from the taxane-containing material, in addition to a plurality of other taxanes, to form a crude methanol extract containing about 0.1-0.5% paclitaxel and having an overall solid content of about 0.5-5% (w/v).<br>
The large volume of methanol extract thus obtained is optionally concentrated, typically about 10-30 fold by evaporation to obtain a methanol extract concentrate having a solid content of about 100-400 g/L.<br>
Liquid-Liquid Extraction<br>
The crude organic extract may be subsequently enriched for taxanes by performing 1-3 liquid-liquid extractions by mixing the organic extract with a non-miscible, organic solvent to form a two phase system wherein one phase contains the plurality of taxanes. Generally, the two phase system includes a polar phase. Optionally, the taxane-containing phase is selected and concentrated by evaporation to form a concentrated extract having a solid content of about 100-400 g/L and a paclitaxel purity of about 1 -4%. In some embodiments, water is included<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
to help remove preferentially water soluble materials and the less polar solvent is selected to remove undesirable compounds such as waxes, lipids, pigments, and sterols that are found in different amounts depending on the taxane-containing material used. Typical solvents for liquid-liquid partitioning include hexane, and methylene chloride. Methylene chloride has generally been found to be suitable for liquid-liquid extraction of taxane-containing material especially when the solvent used for the crude organic extract is an alcohol.<br>
The concentrated extract obtained is optionally evaporated and the residue is re-dissolved in a solvent for loading onto a silica chromatography matrix.<br>
Other example methods of performing a liquid-liquid extraction are illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,475,120, 5,380,916, and 5,670,673 to Rao and references cited therein, and also in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,618,538 and 5,480,639 to ElSohly et al. and references cited therein. These methods or variants thereof may alternatively be used in lieu of the embodiments described. Furthermore, liquid-liquid extraction may be omitted altogether when a plant extract containing high taxane levels is obtained by other methods such as for example, by intervening precipitation, crystallization or chromatography steps. One example of such a method is found in PCT Publication Nos. WO 98/07712 by Zamir et al, which uses a precipitation step immediately after obtaining an initial organic extract to obtain a paclitaxel fraction that may be about 1 % or higher.<br>
Silica Gel Column Chromatoqraphv<br>
As further set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989, the concentrated extract may be further purified by normal phase silica chromatography. As used herein, silica chromatography generally refers to the process of contacting a sample dissolved in a feed solvent with a silica matrix then eluting the silica matrix with an eluting solvent to obtain a fraction enriched with a desired component.<br>
The dimensions of the first silica column are selected according to the quantity and purity of the solids to be separated. In one embodiment of a pilot scale process, about 250 grams of solids are dissolved in about 0.75 liters of feed<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
solvent which is then chromatographed over a Silica column of about 1.5-inches x 10-feet. In another embodiment, about 40-50 kg of solids are dissolved in about 100-200 liters of feed solvent, and chromatographed over a Silica column of about 18-inches x 10-feet.<br>
It has also been shown that a layer of about 1-15 cm of Celite, preferably about 2-8 cm, on top of the silica column is recommended as a column prefilter which substantially decreases the loading time of the sample. It has further been shown that the optimal eluting solvent for the Silica column should be a hexane/acetone mixture at a ratio of about 3:1 or a DCM/ethyl acetate mixture at a ratio of about 7:3. The 'heart cut1 fractions containing at least 2% paclitaxel are pooled and further purified, for example, according to the process set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989. The remaining waste stream fractions, which contain a plurality of taxanes, including, paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB), baccatin III (BACC III), 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III (9-DHB), cephalomannine, 10-deacetyl taxol (10-DAT), 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol are pooled into a waste taxane solution for further processing according to the present invention.<br>
Further Purification Steps<br>
As set forth in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,139,989, the paclitaxel enriched 'heart cut1 fractions obtained from the foregoing chromatography step may be further purified through one or more additional chromatographic or recrystallization steps. Any waste stream fractions or waste mother liquors collected during such additional purification steps may also be pooled and added to the waste taxane solution for further processing according to the present invention.<br>

IV. Process of N-deacvlation of the protected taxane intermediate having an<br>
urea linkage<br>
According to the present invention, a protected taxane of Formula (II) having an urea linkage at the C-3' position further undergoes a N-deacylation step to remove the -C(O)R1 group in the presence of a base. As illustrated in Reaction Scheme 2, a protected docetaxel, as represented by Formula (III) is thus provided:<br>
REACTION SCHEME 2<br><br>
wherein,<br>
R1 is alkyl, alkenyl or aryl; and<br>
R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and independently a hydroxy protecting group.<br>
In one embodiment, R1 is phenyl. In another embodiment, R1 is 2-(2-butenyl). In particular, when R1 is 2-(2-butenyl), compound of Formula (II) is a protected cephalomannine, whose subsequent conversion to docetaxel has been described in U.S. Application No. 10/790,622 (hereafter referred as the '622<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
application). The '622 application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples disclose a representative process for synthesizing a protected taxane derivative from paclitaxel or paclitaxel containing material, and the subsequent conversion of such derivatives to docetaxel. Unless otherwise noted, all scientific and technical terms have the meanings as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 PROTECTION OF C-7, C-2' AND/OR C-10 HYDROXY GROUPS IN A ONE POT REACTION<br>
As shown in Figure 1, to a stirred solution of paclitaxel or paclitaxel containing material, in an organic solvent, such as THF, at around low to room temperature under an argon atmosphere was treated with a hydroxy-protecting agent, such as Boc2O, dichloroacetyl chloride, acetyl chloride, TESCI or like reagents in the presence of a base, such as 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine or n-BuLi or a mixture of n-BuLi/Li-t-OBu or like bases. The reaction was stirred at this temperature for a period between 30 minutes to 2 hours until complete consumption of the starting materials, as evidenced by TLC.<br>
Alternatively, to a stirred solution of paclitaxel or paclitaxel containing material, in an organic solvent, such as THF, at around low to room temperature under an argon atmosphere can be treated with a hydroxy-protecting agent such as ethyl vinyl ether, in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonicacid.<br>

36<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
Preparation of N-acyl paclitaxel derivative<br>
To a solution of the C-7, C-2' and/or C-10 protected paclitaxel derivative in an organic solvent, such as the freshly distilled THF, under argon atmosphere at low to around room temperature most preferably at 20°C, was added drop wise a solution of a base, such as DMAP or n-BuLi in hexanes or like bases. After stirring for 30 min to 1 hr at this temperature, a solution of BoC2O in anhydrous THF was added drop wise to the mixture. The solution was kept at that temperature for an additional 1 to 3 hrs, or until complete consumption of the starting material, as evidenced by TLC, before addition of a solution of an acid in an organic solvent, such as 5% AcOH in THF. The mixture was then partitioned between saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and mixtures of dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. Evaporation of the organic layer yielded a crude paclitaxel derivative having an urea linkage, i.e., a paclitaxel N-t-Boc derivative, which could be further purified by either column chromatography or crystallization to yield a pure protected paclitaxel derivative or used directly for the next step in the synthesis.<br>
Alternatively, DMAP (0,1 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of the paclitaxel (1.0 mmol) in dry acetonitrile followed by BoC2O (1.1 mmol). After stirring for 4 h at room temperature, all starting material was consumed (TLC). The reaction mixture was evaporated at room temperature and the residue partitioned between ether and aqueous KHSO4. The organic extract was thoroughly washed in turn with aqueous solution of KHSO4 and NaHCO3 and finally brine and dried over MgSO4. Evaporation to complete dryness left a light yellow residue that was purified by column chromatography to afford the paclitaxel N-t-Boc derivative.<br>
N-debenzoylation of the paclitaxel N-t-Boc derivative<br>
To the above solution in tetrahydrofuran was added a 1.0 N solution of lithium hydroxide. The solution was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. After removal of tetrahydrofuran in vacuo, the basic aqueous residue was acidified by<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>

Drying (MgSO4) and concentration afforded the crude material that was purified by column chromatography to afford the pure white C-2', C-7 and C-10 protected docetaxel. (Note: The following could also be used: 10 equiv. LiOH, 20 equiv. 30% H2O2,3:1 THF:H2O, 0°C).<br>
EXAMPLE 2 SYNTHESIS OF DOCETAXEL<br>
As further shown in Figure 1, C-2', C-7 and C-10 protected docetaxel was hydrolyzed using formic acid to remove the C-7 and/or C-10 t-Boc protecting group and then with a mixture of NaHCO3/Na2CO3/H2O2 to deprotect the C-2' and/or C-10 acetate groups to yield docetaxel. In the event that the C-2' protecting group is ethoxyethyl, the deprotection is carried out under acidic condition, such as in the presence of acetic acid. Detailed description of deprotection at the C-2', C-7 and C-10 positions are described in U.S. Patent Application No. Application No. 10/790,622, which application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

Nitrosation<br>
To a solution of paclitaxel (0.76 mmol) or a paclitaxel containing material in glacial acetic acid (2.5 ml) and acetic anhydride (5 ml) at 0°C is added NaNO2 (7.6 mmol). The resulting solution can be stirred under argon at 0°C for 16 h and then poured over ice and extracted with diethyl ether. The combined organic extracts can be washed with water, 5% Na2CO3, water and saturated NaCI and dried over MgSO4. The dry extracts can be filtered and then concentrated in<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/004898	PCT/US2005/023224<br>
vacuo, and the crude product is purified by column chromatography using mixtures of hexane-ethyl acetate to afford the pure product.<br>
Hydrolysis<br>
To the above solution in tetrahydrofuran is added a 1.0 N solution of lithium hydroxide. The solution was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. After the removal of tetrahydrofuran in vacuo, the basic aqueous residue can be acidified by the addition of 10% acetic acid and extracted with ether. Drying (MgSO4) and concentration afforded the crude material which can be purified by column chromatography to afford the pure primary amine taxane intermediate. (Note: The following can also be used: 10 equiv. LiOH, 20 equiv. 30% H2O2, in 3:1 THF:H2O)<br>
Reduction<br>
The above hydrolyzed product can then be dissolved in ethanol at room temperature and Raney-Nickel is added in one portion to the stirred solution. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature and treated with hydrogen, until the complete consumption of the starting material. The reaction mixture can be filtered and the filtrate evaporated. The residue is then dissolved in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane and worked up as usual. The crude product can be purified by column chromatography using mixtures of dichloromethane and ethyl acetate to afford the pure primary amine derivative of paclitaxel.<br>
Conversion to Docetaxel<br>
The primary amine derivative of paclitaxel (0.091 mmol) can be dissolved in ethyl acetate (9.1 ml) and a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (9.1 ml) was added. To this biphasic mixture Boc2O (0.18 mmol) can be added. The mixture is stirred for 12 h at room temperature and TLC showed complete consumption of the starting material. The reaction can be worked up as usual and the residue purified by column chromatography using mixtures of dichloromethane and ethyl acetate or acetone to give docetaxel.<br>
