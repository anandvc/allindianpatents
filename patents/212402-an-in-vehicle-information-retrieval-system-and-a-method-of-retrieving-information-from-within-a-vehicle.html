CAR DISPLAY CAPTURE APPARATUS	 <br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an in-vehicle information retrieval system and to a method of retrieving information from within a vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND TO INVENTION<br>
In many modern motor vehicles, it is becoming mcreasingly common to incorporate some form of display facility such as an LCD panel. The LCD panel may be integrated into the car in one of a number of available locations such as above a rear-view mirror of the vehicle, in a center console or in the backrests of front seats of the vehicle. These display facilities may have a number of applications including such things as television, viewing of DVD or video content, vehicle navigation systems or video game displays.<br>
Currently, any displayed image may only appear on the LCD for as long as the video source outputs that image. This means that, if information that viewer deemed to be useful was presented in some form on the LCD, and the viewer decided that information was to be revisited at some later time, then the viewer would either need to copy the information by writing it down or trying to remember the content.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1 of the drawings, an in-vehicle information retrieval system is illustrated and is designated generally by the reference numeral 10. The system 10 includes a data generating module in the form of a video output module 12. Video images output from the module 12 are sent to a display facility 18 via a data line 20. The display facility 18 is, conveniently, an LCD panel mounted in a suitable location in the vehicle.<br>
Video data from the module 12 are also output on line 22 to a data capture module or image capture module 14. The image capture module 14 encodes received video data from the module 12 into a compressed image format such as JPEG. Supplementary information such as text representing the time and date at which the image was captured which is required to be overlaid or inserted in some fashion into the printed output hard-copy may also be included in the compressed output from the image capture module 14.<br>
Compressed data are transmitted on line 24 to a printer controller 42 of a printing unit 16 of the system 10. The printer controller 42 controls a printer 100 of the printing unit 16.<br><br>
Compressed data from the image capture module are also transmitted on line 28 to a wireless communications sub-system 50 for transferring a copy of the captured data to a remote storage database or server for later retrieval or for publication on a website, or the like.<br>
If desired, the system 10 could include a data storage means (not shown), such as a flash memory card, or other suitable storage media with the necessary capacity, for storing the captured image,<br>
The system 10 includes a user terminal 26 which is operated by a user, normally an occupant of the vehicle, to activate the image capture module 14 for capturing an image output by the video output module 12.<br>
Certain of the components of the system 10 are now described in greater detail.<br>
Referring to Figure 15 of the drawings, various forms of wireless communications sub-system 50 could be employed. One technique is to use a combination of satellite communications and a mobile telephone network.<br>
The sub-system 50 includes a mobile station 52 (being the motor vehicle in this invention) and a fixed station 54. A satellite is designated generally by the reference numeral 56. The satellite 56 communications with the mobile station 52 via a satellite receiver 5S. The satellite 56 also communications with the base station 54 via a satellite up link 60,<br>
In addition, the mobile station 52 includes a mobile phone network based transmitter 64 which communicates with a mobile phone network based receiver 66 at the bay station 54.<br>
To enable data to be transmitted from the mobile station 52 to the base station 54, satellite transmission via the satellite 56 is employed as well as the mobile telephone network using the transmitter 64 and the receiver 66.<br>
The printer controller 42 is responsible for handling the hardware specific aspects of the printing process. This enables a number of different types of printing mechanisms or printers 100 .to be adopted without changing details of the system further up the chain of print modules.<br>
The printer controller 42 receives a compresses version of each image. The image may be received in its entirety or in a band-wise fashion depending on the size of the image.<br>
In the printer controller 42, the image data are progressively accessed in printer order, decompressed if required and organised into a format suitable for hardware of the printer 100 to enable the hardware of the printer 100 to program its printhead 300. This recognition may include such factors as may be necessary to account for special characteristics of a particular printhead 300 such as up scaling and dithering of the print data and adjustments, if necessary, for the markers and paper being used.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 to 7 of the drawings, the printer 100 is described in greater detail.<br>
The printer 100 includes a chassis 112 (Figure 3) which is covered by atop cover 116 that has an access opening 118 closed off by a flap 120. The flap 120 is spring biased so that, when a cartridge 122 has been removed from the printer 100, the flap is urged upwards to close off the access opening 118.<br>
The device which sends commands to the printer 100 can either be hard wired to the printer 100, for example, via a wiring loom of the motor vehicle or, instead, the device may send commands to the printer 100<br><br>
in a wireless manner. For this purpose, the printer 100 includes a port 124 able to detect wireless communications, such as infra-red communications.<br>
The printer 100 incorporates a printhead 300 (Figure 3). The printhead 300 is a pagewidth ink jet prinlhead. More particularly, the printhead 300 is a four color printhead, or three color plus infra red ink, printhead which prints photo quaHty prints on print media stored in the cartridge 122. The printhead 300 comprises an array of nozzles to provide printing at 1600 dpi, The nozzles of the printhead 300 are manufactured using the applicant's Vlemjet technology. The printhead is described in greater detail below.<br>
The prmthead 300 receives commands from a printed circuit board (PCB) 136 secured to the chassis 112.<br>
A pair of dri\e motors 138 and 140 is. mounted on a sidewall 142 of the chassis 1 12. The drive motor 138, which is m the form of a stepper motor, drives a first drive arrangement in the form of a first gear train 144. The first gear train 144 is mounted on a side molding 146 of the chassis I 12.<br>
The drive motor 140, which is also in the form of a stepper motor, drives a drive roller 148 via a second drive arrangement in the form of a second gear train 150.<br>
The printhead 300 receives ink from ink hoses 152 which communicate vvith an ink supply reservoir 154 (Figure 7) of the cartridge 122 via an ink supply manifold 156, as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
Referring to Figure 4 of the drawings, an exploded view of the printer 100 is illustrated.  It is to be noted that the printhead 300 communicates with the PCB 136 via a TAB film 154.<br>
A slot 158 is defined in the side molding 146. The slot 158 receives a corresponding formation of the cartridge 122 in it. Further, a roller set 160 is mounted on a base 162 of the printer 100. The roller set 160 comprises a rotatable axle 162. A cog 164 is mounted proximate each end of the axle 162.  Each cog 164 engages ajongitudinally extending rack 200, 202, one on each side of the cartridge 122, for inhibiting skewing of the cartridge 122 as it is inserted into, or withdrawn from, the printer 100.<br>
The first gear train 144 engages a pick up roller 168 of the printer 100. The pick up roller 168 picks up print media in the form of a sheet of paper from a stack 170 of paper (Figure 5) in the cartridge 122 for feeding to the printhead 300 of the printer 100 when printing is to be effected.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figure 4 of the drawings, the first gear train 144 is powered by the stepper motor 138 via an axle 172 extending across the printer 100 to convey power from the stepper motor 138 to the first gear train 144. A gear 174 is mounted against the molding 146 at one end of the axl^ 172. The gear 174 drives a reduction gear set 176. Further, the reduction gear set 176 communicates with a reversing mechanism 178. Accordingly, the gear train 144 performs two functions. When the reversing mechanism 178 is not selected, the gear train 144 engages an upper rack 180 on the cartridge 122 for feeding the cartridge 122 into the printer 100 or ejecting the cartridge 122 from the printer 100. Instead, when the reversing mechanism has been selected, it engages the pick up roller 168 or, more particularly, a gear 182 mounted at an end of the pick up roller 168. The gear train 144 then serves to feed the paper to the drive roller 148 for conveying to the printhead 300.<br><br>
Referring now to Figures 6 and 7 of the drawings, the cartridge 122 is described in greater detail.<br>
The cartridge 122 comprises a base molding 190. The base molding 190 is closed off by a metal cover 192. The cover 192 has a pair of transversely spaced openings 194 defined in a front edge thereof. These openings 194 permit the pick up roller 168 of the printer 100 to engage a topmost sheet of the stack 170 of paper within the cartridge 122.<br>
A toothed rack 196 is provided on one side of the cartridge 122. The toothed rack 196 defines the upper rack 180 which is engaged by a gear of the first gear train 144 for insertion of the cartridge 122 into, or its ejection from, the printer 100. A rib 198 extends longitudinally along the side of the toothed rack 196. The rib 198 is received in the slot 158 in the side molding 146 of the printer 100, A lower surface of the toothed rack 196 also has one of the longitudinally extending racks 200 (Figure 7) for engagement with one of the cogs 164. An opposed side of the base molding 190 of the cartridge 122 carries the other of the longitudinally extending racks 202 which engages the other cog 164 for inhibiting skewing of the cartridge 122 when it is inserted into, or ejected from, the printer 100.<br>
A feed slot 204 is defined at a front edge of the metal cover through which a sheet of paper to be printed is passed in use. The feed slot 204 is partially defined by a plastics strip 206 which inhibits more than one sheet of paper being fed to the printhead 300 at any one time.<br>
A transversely extending trough 208 is defined outwardly of the strip 206. The trough 208 accommodates a sprung roller 210 therein. The roller 210 is supported in the trough 208 via a plurality of clips 212.<br>
The roller 210 is biased upwardly relative to a base of the trough 208 via a plurality of leaf springs 214. The leaf springs 214 are formed integrally with an L-shaped metal bracket 216 which partially forms the trough 208. The roller 210 is a snap-fit in the clips 212.<br>
A platen 218 is accommodated in the base molding 190. The platen 218 is spring biased via a plurality of leaf springs 220 which engage a floor 222 of the base molding 190 for urging the stack 170 of paper against the cover 192.<br>
The ink supply reservoir 154 includes an ink supply molding 224 formed integrally with the base molding 190. The ink supply molding 224 defines a plurality of ink supply channels 226.  Each ink supply channel 226 contains a particular color of ink. In this context, the term "color" is to be understood as including inks which are invisible in the visible spectrum such as, for example, infra red inks.<br>
The channels 226 are closed off by a flexible bladder-like membrane 228 which is heat-sealed to the molding 224. It will be appreciated that, as ink is withdrawn from each channel 226, the associated membrane 228 collapses into the channel 226 thereby inhibiting the ingress of air into that channel 226.<br>
Each channel 226 communicates with an ink outlet 230. Each ink outlet 230 is in the form of a rupturable seal.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figure 4 of the drawings, the ink supply manifold 156 of the printer 100 includes pins 232. These pins 232 communicate with the ink supply hoses 152. When the cartridge 122 is<br><br>
inserted into the printer 100, and the cartridge 122 is driven home by the gear train 144, the pins 232 pierce the seals 230 to place the hoses 152 in communication with their associated ink supply channels 226.<br>
The cartridge 122 includes a quality assurance chip 234. This chip 234 ensures correct communications between the cartridge 122 and the printer 100 and that the cartridge 122 is of the required quality. The chip 234 communicates with the printer 100 via chip contacts 236 mounted on the ink supply manifold 156 of the printer 100. Thus, when the cartridge 122 is driven home by the gear train 144, the chip 234 engages the contacts 236 for enabling communications to be established between the chip 234 and the circuit board 136 of the printer 100.<br>
The cartridge 122 is a disposable unit so that, once its ink supply and paper supply ha\e been depleted, the cartridge is disposed of Instead, the cartridge 122 may be re-useable. In the latter case, once the supply of ink and paper in the cartridge 122 have been depleted and the cartridge 122 is ejected from the printer 100, the used, empty cartridge 122 can be taken by a user to a supplier for a refund. It is to be noted that the cartridge 122 is automatically ejected from the printer 100 once its supply of paper and or ink has been depleted.<br>
Referring to Figures 8 to 14 of the drawings, the printhead 300 is described in greater detail. The printhead 300 comprises an array, which will be described in greater detail below, of nozzle assemblies. .  In a particularly preferred form, the printhead includes Memjet technology as described in the patent applications and patents listed in the paragraph headed "Related Patent Applications and Patents", at page 2, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by way of explicit reference.<br>
Referring to Figure 8 of the drawings, a nozzle assembly is illustrated and is designated generally by the reference numeral 400<br>
The assembly 400 includes a silicon substrate or wafer 416 on which a dielectric layer 418 is deposited. A CMOS passivation layer 420 is deposited on the dielectric layer 418.<br>
Each nozzle assembly 400 includes a nozzle 422 defining a nozzle opening 424, a connecting member in the form of a lever arm 426 and an actuator 428. The lever arm 426 connects the actuator 428 to the nozzle 422.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figures 9 to 11 of the drawings, the nozzle 422 comprises a crown portion 430 with a skirt portion 432 depending from the crown portion 430. The skirt portion 432 forms part of a peripheral wall of a nozzle chamber 434. The nozzle opening 424 is in fluid communication with the nozzle chamber 434. It is to be noted that the nozzle opening 424 is surrounded by a raised rim 436 vvhich "pins" a meniscus 438 (Figure 9) of a body of ink 440 in the nozzle chamber 434.<br>
An ink inlet aperture 442 (shown most clearly in Figure 13 of the drawings) is defined in a floor 446 of the nozzle chamber 434. The aperture 442 is in fluid communication with an ink inlet channel 448 defined through the substrate 416.<br>
A wall portion 450 bounds the aperture 442 and extends upwardly from the floor portion 446. The skirt portion 432, as indicated above, of the nozzle 422 defines a first part of a peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 434 and the wall portion 450 defines a second part of the peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 434.<br><br>
/<br>
The wall 450 has an inwardly directed hp 452 at its free end which serves as a fluidic seal which inhibits the escape of ink when the nozzle 422 is displaced, as will be described in greater detail below. It will be appreciated that, due to the viscosity of the ink 440 and the small dimensions of the spacing between the lip 452 and the skirt portion 432, the inwardly directed lip 452 and surface tension function as a seal for inhibiting the escape of ink from the nozzle chamber 434.<br>
The actuator 428 is a thermal bend actuator and is connected to an anchor 454 extending upwardly from the substrate 416 or, more particularly, from the CMOS passivation layer 420. The anchor 454 is mounted on conductive pads 456 which form an electrical connection with the actuator 428.<br>
The actuator 428 comprises a pair of first, active beams 458 arranged above a pair of second, passive beams 460.  In a preferred embodiment, both pairs of beams 458 and 460 are of, or include, a conductive ceramic material such as titanium nitride (TiN).<br>
Both pairs of beams 458 and 460 have their first ends anchored to the anchor 454 and their opposed ends connected to the arm 426. When a current is caused to flow through the active beams 458 thermal expansion of the beams 458 result. As the passive beams 460, through which there is no current flow, do not expand at the same rate, a bending moment is created causing the arm 426 and, hence, the nozzle 422 to be displaced downwardly towards the substrate 416 as shown in Figure 10 of the drawings. This causes ejection of ink through the nozzle opening 424 as shown at 462 in Figure 10 of the drawings. When the source of heat is removed from the active beams 458, i.e. by stopping current flow, the nozzle 422 returns to its quiescent position as shown in Figure 11 of the drawings. When the nozzle 422 returns to its quiescent position, an ink droplet 464 is formed as a result of the breaking of an ink droplet neck as illustrated at 466 in Figure 1 1 of the drawings. The ink droplet 464 then travels on to the print media such as a sheet of paper. As a result of the formation of the ink droplet 464, a "negative" meniscus is formed as shown at 468 in Figure 1 I of the drawings. This "negative" meniscus 468 results in an inflow of ink 440 into the nozzle chamber 434 such that a new meniscus 438 is formed in readiness for the next ink drop ejection from the nozzle assembly 400.<br>
Referring now to Figures 12 to 14 of the drawings, a part of the printhead 300 is described in greater detail. The printhead 300 is a four color printhead. Accordingly, the printhead 300 includes four groups 370 of nozzle assemblies, one for each color. Each group 370 has its nozzle assemblies 400 arranged in two rows 372 and 374. One of the groups 370 is shown in greater detail in Figure 13 of the drawings.<br>
To facilitate close packing of the nozzle assemblies 400 in the rows 372 and 374, the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 374 are offset or staggered with respect to the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 372. Also, the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 372 are spaced apart sufficiently far from each other to enable the lever arms 426 of the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 374 to pass between adjacent nozzles 422 of the assemblies 400 in the row 372. It is to be noted that each nozzle assembly 400 is substantially dumbbell shaped so that the nozzles 422 in the row 372 nest between the nozzles 422 and the actuators 428 of adjacent nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 374.<br>
Further, to facilitate close packing of the nozzles 422 in the rows 372 and 374, each nozzle 422 is substantially hexagonally shaped.<br><br>
The substrate 416 has bond pads 376 arranged thereon which provide the electrical connections, via the pads 456, to the actuators 428 of the nozzle assemblies 400. These electrical connections are formed via the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
A nozzle guard 380 is mounted on the substrate 416 of the printhead 300. The nozzle guard 380 includes a body member 382 having a plurality of passages 384 defined therethrough. The passages 384 are in register with the nozzle openings 424 of the nozzle assemblies 400 of the printhead 300 such that, when ink is ejected from any one of the nozzle openings 424, the ink passes through the associated passage 384 before striking the print media.<br>
The body member 382 is mounted in spaced relationship relative to the nozzle assemblies 400 by limbs or struts 386. One of the struts 836 has air inlet openings 388 defined therein.<br>
When the printhead 300 is in operation, air is charged through the inlet openings 388 to be forced through the passages 384 together with ink travelling through the passages 384. The purpose of the air is to maintain the passages 384 clear of foreign particles. A danger exists that these foreign particles, such as dust particles, could fall onto the nozzle assemblies 400 adversely affecting their operation. With the provision of the air inlet openings 388 in the nozzle guard 380 this problem is, to a large extent, obviated.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the printer 100 is built into and forms part of an in-car entertainment unit 500, as shown in Figure 16 of the drawings.<br>
The ICE unit 500, in addition to a CD player 502 and a radio having controls 504, includes a full color LCD 506. The unit 500 functions as a satellite navigation unit and may also be used for receiving television signals. The unit 500 incorporates a printer 100 of the type described above. The unit 500 includes a bank of control buttons 508. This bank of buttons 508 constitutes GPS controls and is used for satellite navigation purposes. In addition, the unit includes the user terminal 26 which is provided for controlling the printer 100 and the content printed by the printer 100.<br>
In use, when it is desired to capture content of the video output module 12, the user terminal 26 is activated by the user. Activation of the user terminal, in turn, causes activation of the image capture module 14 so that data which are output by the video output module are captured via data line 22. Image compression techniques are then used in the image capture module 14 so that compressed image data are output on data line 24 to the printer controller 42. The printer controller 42 manipulates the compressed image data into a suitable format to be printed by the printer 100 so that a hard copy of the captured image is printed. As indicated above, supplementary information may be overlayed or inserted in some other fashion into the printed image.<br>
If desired, the captured image can also be output on data line 28 to the wireless communications subsystem 50 for onward transmission to a remote server.<br>
One class of application where the present system 10 is useful is in the capture of video game screens. For example, a player of the video game may wish to have a hard copy of that player's highest score in a particular game. By means of the system 10 such an image can be captured and printed.<br><br>
Thus, if one or more players are playing a video game in a vehicle making use of the built-in display facility 18 and one of the players were to achieve a highest score or a score that was of significance based on previous game play then by actuating the user terminal 26 a printed record of that achievement can be produced for future reference.<br>
Another application in which the present system is of use is in the capture of frames from television broadcasts such as a weather broadcast or to obtain hard copies of information broadcast in a television program, for example, the location of a restaurant.<br>
Thus, the wireless communications sub-system 50 can be used to receive broadcast signals which are displayed via the video output module 12 on the display facility 18.<br>
Often, these television broadcasts contain information that a viewer is interested in sa\mg for later reference. For example, whilst watching a weather program, the amount of information presented in a single display may be too great for a user to comprehend at once.<br>
The same is also true for some programs, for example, that provide restaurant reviews, or the like. This problem is compounded if a viewer happens to be in a vehicle where there is a likelihood of other distractions being present.<br>
By means of the system 10, should a viewer see a television program which the viewer wishes to save for later reference, by appropriately actuating the user terminal 26, images relating to the program can be saved and printed.<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the invention, that a system 10 is provided which facilitates printing of images displayed on a display facility in a motor vehicle. This obviates the need for either trying to memorise content of images displayed on such a display facility or attempt to write down details regarding such images which necessitates finding paper and pen to record the information.  It will be appreciated that, even if it is not the driver of the vehicle that is attempting to find such paper and pen, this can be distracting to the driver which can be dangerous.<br>
It is another advantage of the invention that a system 10 is provided that enables occupants of the vehicle to record images that they have seen and that they desire to print out for later reference.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to a number of specific embodiments, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms. It will fijrther be understood that any reference herein to known prior art does not, unless the contrary indication appears, constitute an admission that such prior art is commonly known by those skilled in the art to which the invention/elates.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
