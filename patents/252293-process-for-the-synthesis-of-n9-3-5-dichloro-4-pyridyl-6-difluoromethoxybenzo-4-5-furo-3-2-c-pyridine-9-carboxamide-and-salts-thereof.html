AND SALTS THEREOF<br>
This application claims the benefit of Indian Patent Application Nos. 2087/MUM/2006, filed December 20, 2006, and 1304/MUM/2007, filed July 6, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/896,579, filed March 23, 2007, and 60/950,642, filed July 19, 2007, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of N9-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridyl)-6-difluoromethoxybenzo[4,5]furo[3,2-c]pyridine-9-carboxamide and salts thereof which are useful as PDE4 inhibitors. The invention also relates to a process for the synthesis of methyl-2-formyl-7-cyclopentyloxybenzo[b]furan-4-carboxyIate and salts thereof, which are useful as intermediates in preparing compounds with PDE4 inhibitory activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The phosphodiesterase enzymes play an integral role in cell signaling mechanisms by hydrolyzing cAMP and cGMP to their inactive 5' forms. Inhibition of PDE enzymes thus results in an elevation of cAMP and/or cGMP levels and alters intracellular responses to extra cellular signals by affecting the processes mediated by cyclic nucleotides. It has been demonstrated that increasing cAMP levels within these cells results in suppression of cell activation, which in turn inhibits the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a. Since eosinophils are believed to be a critical pro-inflammatory target for asthma, identification of the expression of the PDE4 gene family in eosinophils led to PDE4 as a potential therapeutic target for asthma [Rogers, D.F., Giembycz, M.A., Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 19, 160-164, (1998); Barnes, P.J., Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 19, 415-423, (1998)].<br>
PCT Publication No. WO 2006/064355 discloses compounds of Formula I,<br><br>
Formula I as     PDE4     inhibitors     including,     for     example     N9-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridyl)-6-difluoromethoxybenzo[4,5]furo[3,2-c]pyridine-9-carboxamide   sodium   as   a   selective PDE4 inhibitor. WO 2006/064355 discloses processes for preparing compounds of Formula I.<br>
The inventors have found that the processes described in these references are not suitable from a commercial point of view because these processes involve protection and deprotection steps which substantially reduce the yield and are also difficult to scale-up.<br>
The present invention provides an alternative process, which is economical, convenient, efficient and easily scalable. Furthermore, the yields and purity of the intermediates and final products are high.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for preparing N9-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridyl)-6-difluoromethoxybenzo[4,5]furo[3&gt;2-c]pyridine-9-carboxamide sodium which is useful as a PDE4 inhibitor.<br>
