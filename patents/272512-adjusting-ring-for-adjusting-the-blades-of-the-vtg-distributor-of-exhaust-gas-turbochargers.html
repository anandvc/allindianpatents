Adjusting ring for adjusting the blades of the VTG distributor of exhaust gas turbochargers<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to an adjusting ring for adjusting the blades of the VTG distributor of exhaust gas turbochargers.<br>
The term "VTG distributor" is to be understood to mean an arrangement which serves to provide exhaust gas turbochargers with a variable turbine geometry. An adjusting ring of the type specified in the preamble of claim 1 serves to adjust said variable turbine geometry, which adjusting ring has a bearing ring for holding bearing bodies and a lever engagement ring. The lever engagement ring is provided with grooves into which the levers of the VTG blades engage.<br>
Such known adjusting rings are formed as fully-cut components which are conventionally produced in turning or milling processes or combined working steps. For this purpose, the adjusting ring with its bearing ring and a lever engagement ring is formed as an integral part from a solid material. This is however a relatively time-consuming and expensive production method.<br>
Casting a complete adjusting ring raw part with subsequent cutting machining also does not lead to significant cost advantages.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to create an adjusting ring of the type specified in the preamble of claim 1, which adjusting ring can be produced in a simple and cost-effective manner.<br><br>
WO 2006/122596	PCT/EP2006/002233<br>
- 2 -<br>
It is also an object of the invention to create a method for producing an adjusting ring of said type.<br>
The achievement of said object is provided by means of the features of claim 1 and of claim 9.<br>
According to the invention, the adjusting ring is produced from a plurality of separately produced individual parts, at least two separately produced individual parts, which are connected to one another by means of a suitable connecting device. Here, the individual parts can be produced completely by primary forming (fine casting or sintering), shaping (pressing) or separating methods, preferably punching, or require a small degree of cutting finishing such as turning or milling.<br>
The individual parts can be composed of different materials which are adapted to the specific bearing function of the bearing ring or bearing section of the adjusting ring, and to the guidance of the blade levers of the lever engagement ring or lever engagement section.<br>
There is also the advantage that the bearing ring and the lever engagement ring can be adapted to said functions in a simple manner in terms of their geometry. Targeted hardening of the surface according to the required properties is for example possible.<br>
Subclaims 2 to 6 contain advantageous refinements of the adjusting ring according to the invention.<br>
Claims 8 to 11 define a method according to the invention for producing an adjusting ring as explained above.<br><br>
WO 2006/122596	PCT/EP2006/002233<br>
- 3 -<br>
According to said claims, the bearing ring and the lever engagement ring are produced in each case in a separate production step as separate individual parts.<br>
The two rings are thereafter connected to one another by means of a suitable connecting device.<br>
In principle, all suitable cohesive or form-fitting connections can be considered as a connecting device.<br>
In the method according to the invention, however, flanging or overturning processes and also welding or soldering are particularly preferred for connecting the bearing ring and the production ring.<br>
In principle, a screw connection or a rivet connection would also be conceivable.<br>
Further details, advantages and features of the invention can be gathered from the following description of an exemplary embodiment on the basis of the drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a front view of an adjusting ring according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 2 shows a section illustration of the adjusting ring as per figure 1 along the line A-A in figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an adjusting ring 1 according to the invention for adjusting the blades of a VTG distributor of exhaust gas turbochargers.<br>
The adjusting ring 1 has a bearing ring 2 which is provided for guiding suitable bearing bodies (rolling bodies).<br><br>
WO 2006/122596	PCT/EP2006/002233<br>
- 4 -<br>
In addition, the adjusting ring 1 has a lever engagement ring 2 which has a plurality of grooves arranged on the periphery, one of which grooves is denoted by the reference symbol 5.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the adjusting ring with its two components, the bearing ring and the lever engagement ring 3, is a circular component which is illustrated again in figure 2 along the section line A-A.<br>
Here, figure 2 shows that the bearing ring 2 and the lever engagement ring 3, after their production as individual parts, are connected to one another by means of a connecting device 4 in order to form the adjusting ring 1 in its entirety. The connecting device 4 is shown here by the separating line between the bearing ring 2 and the lever engagement ring 3 and can be generated by means of one of the production methods explained in the introduction.<br><br>
