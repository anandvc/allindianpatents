				<td>The present invention relates to a diketopiperazine compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
This invention relates to the use of a class of diketopiperazine derivatives as potent and selective antagonists of oxytocin, to novel compounds within that class and to processes for their preparation.<br>
USP5817751 describes combinatorial and solid phase methods for the synthesis of diverse diketopiperazine derivatives and the use of these methods to create libraries of diverse diketopiperazine derivatives.<br>
W099/47549 describes diketopiperazine derivatives including 3-benzyl-2,5 diketopiperazine derivatives as inhibitors of fructose 1,6-bisphospate (FBPase). W099/38844 describes a method for preparing N-[aliphatic or aromatic) carbonyl]-2-aminoacetarnide compounds and their cyclisation to give inter alia diketopiperazine derivatives.<br>
WO99/37304 describes oxaheterocyclyl compounds including oxapiperazinyl compounds that are inhibitors of Factor Xa.<br>
The hormone oxytocin is potent contractor of the uterus and is used for the induction or augmentation of labour. Also the density of uterine oxytocin receptors increases significantly by &gt;100 fold during pregnancy and peaks in labour (pre-term and term). Pre-term births/labour (between 24 and 37 weeks) causes about 60% of infant mortality/morbidity and thus a compound which inhibits the uterine actions of oxytocin e.g. oxytocin antagonists, should be useful for the prevention or control of pre-term labour.<br>
We have found a class of diketopiperazine derivatives which exhibit a particularly useful level of activity as selective antagonists at the oxytocin receptor. <br>
The present invention thus a method of treating or preventing diseases or conditions mediated through the action of oxytocin which comprises administering to a mammal in need thereof of an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I)<br>

The ability of the compounds of formula (I) to inhibit the actions of oxytocin may be determined using a variety of conventional procedures.<br>
Thus, compounds of formula (1) have a high affinity for the oxytocin receptors on the uterus of rats and humans and this may be determined using conventional procedure. For example the affinity for the oxytocin receptors on the rat uterus may be determined by the procedure olTetlibone et al, Drug Development Research 30. 129-142 (1993). The compounds of the invention also exhibit high affinity at the human recombinant oxytocin roceplor in C11O cells and this may be conveniently demonstrated using the procedure described by Wyatt et al.

The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and diluted with ethyl acetate. This was washed with IN hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and brine. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacua. The residue was diluted with ethyl acetate (100ml) and acetic acid (10ml) and hydrogenated at atmospheric pressure over 1 0% palladium on activated carbon (1 .5g).
