				<td>The present invention relates to a diketopiperazine compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
This invention relates to the use of a class of diketopiperazine derivatives as potent and selective antagonists of oxytocin, to novel compounds within that class and to processes for their preparation.<br>
USP5817751 describes combinatorial and solid phase methods for the synthesis of diverse diketopiperazine derivatives and the use of these methods to create libraries of diverse diketopiperazine derivatives.<br>
W099/47549 describes diketopiperazine derivatives including 3-benzyl-2,5 diketopiperazine derivatives as inhibitors of fructose 1,6-bisphospate (FBPase). W099/38844 describes a method for preparing N-[aliphatic or aromatic) carbonyl]-2-aminoacetarnide compounds and their cyclisation to give inter alia diketopiperazine derivatives.<br>
WO99/37304 describes oxaheterocyclyl compounds including oxapiperazinyl compounds that are inhibitors of Factor Xa.<br>
The hormone oxytocin is potent contractor of the uterus and is used for the induction or augmentation of labour. Also the density of uterine oxytocin receptors increases significantly by &gt;100 fold during pregnancy and peaks in labour (pre-term and term). Pre-term births/labour (between 24 and 37 weeks) causes about 60% of infant mortality/morbidity and thus a compound which inhibits the uterine actions of oxytocin e.g. oxytocin antagonists, should be useful for the prevention or control of pre-term labour.<br>
We have found a class of diketopiperazine derivatives which exhibit a particularly useful level of activity as selective antagonists at the oxytocin receptor. <br>
The present invention thus a method of treating or preventing diseases or conditions mediated through the action of oxytocin which comprises administering to a mammal in need thereof of an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I)<br>
