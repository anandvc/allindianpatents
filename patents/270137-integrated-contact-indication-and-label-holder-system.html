INDIA<br><br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
NATURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
INTEGRATED CONTACT INDICATION AND LABEL HOLDER<br>
A) Technical field<br>
[0001] The embodiments herein generally relate to the switching devices and more particularly it relates to the contact indication and label holder for switching devices such as miniature circuit breaker, residual current circuit breaker, and isolator to provide safety indications to the technicians or end users.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] Switching devices such as miniature circuit breakers, residual circuit breakers and isolators etc are used in domestic and industrial applications for protection against over currents. It is generally required to control electrical power networks by switching circuit "ON", by carrying load and by switching circuit "OFF" under manual or automatic suspension. When there is an over current resulting in an electrical circuits, the contacts in the switching devices open or trips to block the current which is greater then the rating of the current device.<br>
[0003] There are several provisions available to control the electrical contacts. In some cases it includes manual operation, where the moving contact is moved in conjunction with the fixed contact to open or close the electrical<br><br><br>
connection. In other cases, whenever the over current occurs in the power circuits, the circuit breakers trips automatically to break the contacts. The function of the circuit breakers is to maintain two stable conditions close and open.<br>
[0004] However in certain cases the switching devices operate due to fault. During operation of switching devices like miniature circuit breaker, residual current circuit breaker, and isolator there are chances that due to high currents contact gets welded and current still flows through circuit even if knob of device showing it in "OFF" state. So in case of maintenance if someone comes in direct contact with circuit, thinking breaker is "OFF", it may result in serious shock and can be fatal. In some circumstances the moving contact remains stuck on fixed contact with an adhesive force such that the mechanism is not enough to break the joint. In such exceptional circumstances, it is necessary that the switch control indicates the closed position of the switch.<br>
[0005] Generally operating knob of mese switching devices is hinged about an axis rotating between certain angles. The operating knob has two stable states, "OFF" and "ON" between which it gets toggled. However in certain cases when switching devices operates due to fault i.e. knob changes its position from "ON" to "OFF", sometimes the contacts gets welded and current still flows through device, and due to this wrong indication of contacts accident can occur with operator. In order to notice such a condition there should be some means to detect the status of the circuit breaker i.e. either "ON" or OFF. In industrial and domestic applications it is very important for the technicians and<br><br><br>
the end users to know the working of an electrical load or appliance connected to the power circuit before working on it. When several technicians are engaged in serving the electrical equipment there is a need to identify if switching devices is turned "OFF" and "ON". So there should be provision for proper identification in device itself.<br>
[0006] The prior methods for contact indication for circuit breaker include an operating mechanism for opening and closing the contacts. It includes a shuttle means with operating handle that blocks the manual movement of operating handle upon the contacts being closed. A switch control mechanism to control if the contact sticks, which has a spring and a connecting rod assembly articulated between moving contact and automatic trip lever. None of the prior art gives the method for true contact indication and identification of switching devices on the same platform. In conventional indication system, if seen from a distance, many times it is difficult to differentiate red and green colour in indication window as both look as black due to small size which creates confusion. Many switching devices are having either contact indication or label holder for identification, which are much complexion in assemblies and time and cost consuming.<br>
[0007] It is very essential that switching device should indicate its true or actual contact positions i.e. either "ON" or "OFF". In domestic or industrial applications there are chances that due to lack of proper identification on switching devices operator switches "ON" or "OFF" wrong device which can be   problematic   sometimes.   So   there   should   be   provision   for   proper<br><br><br>
identification in device itself. Technicians find difficult to identify the true contact of the switching devices and also in identifying the switching devices which is time consuming. Each time technicians are required to inspect the switching devices for proper identification. Hence there is a need to develop an improved means for contact indication and identification of switching devices for user reliability which consumes less time. There is a further need to provide both features (contact indication and label holder) for identification using same component to reduce cost and improve efficiency of assembly.<br>
B) Object of the invention<br>
[0008] An object of the embodiment is to provide an improved means for contact indication and identification of switching devices for user reliability which consumes less time and maintenance cost.<br>
[0009] Another object of the embodiment is to provide an identification mechanism for identification of switching device so as to avoid the manual switching of unwanted breakers.<br>
[0010] Another object of the embodiment is to provide both features (contact indication and label holder) for identification using same component reducing cost and time for assembly.<br><br><br>
C) Summary<br>
[0011] The present invention deals with the field of electrical power supply and controllers (switching devices) used for domestic as well industrial purpose. Switching devices such as miniature circuit breaker, residual current circuit breaker, and isolator &amp; like are generally used to provide protection against over current, under current supply and or line leakages to the end product. Generally operating knob of these switching devices is hinged about an axis rotating between certain angles. The operating knob has two stable states, "OFF" and "ON" between which it gets toggled. However in certain cases when switching devices operates due to fault i.e. knob changes its position from "ON" to "OFF", sometimes the contacts gets welded and current still flows through device, and due to this wrong indication of contacts accident can occur with operator.<br>
[0012] The present invention provides an assembly of contact indication and label holder using the same component for switching devices to provide safety indications to the technicians or end users. The present invention also deals with the identification of switching device so as to avoid the manual switching of unwanted breakers. The user can put small paper strip in label holder mentioning the name i.e. with which place it is connected e.g. kitchen, store, bedroom etc and other details. In case of accidents or fire in electric wiring or appliances of a particular area or room user can easily identify which switch is needed to be switched "OFF".<br><br><br>
[0013] The assembly comprises of a tag and label holder. Tagging arrangement consists of an indication window for indication status of MCB i.e. ON/OFF and two hinges for holding label holder. The component also has two windows, which are intended for locking of label holder and groove for holding indicating paper. The label holder revolves about the two hinges. Label holder consists of two holes to be fitted in tag and two locks for locking in windows of tag while holding paper. This label holder is made up of transparent material.

When knob is in "OFF" position green indication flag (4) is visible through the indication window (lb). When the breaker is switched "ON" i.e. knob is pushed up, moving contact (6) moves towards right or becomes inclined. As green indication flag (4) is direcdy connected to moving contact (6) with pivot (8), it moves up making red indication flag (5) visible through the indication window (lb) (shown in FIG. 1). When indication tag assembly is on the housing (7) then red indication flag (5) or green indication flag (4) is visible through the indication window (lb) (shown in FIG. 1) depending upon the status of switch<br><br><br>
i.e. "ON" or 'OFF".<br>
[0030] FIG. 4 shows how tag (1) and label holder (2) assembly will be assembled to MCB and how flags (red flag (5) and green flag (4)) indicate true contact position of moving contact (6). FIG. 5 shows the MCB in "ON" condition and the indication link showing red flag (5) in the indication window (la). The green flag (4) moves upwards along with the mechanism pivot (8) as the MCB is turned "ON" from "OFF'. So red flag (5) is seen in the indication window (la). Moving contact (6) is that contact of switch which makes and breaks contacts. In FIG. 4 moving contact is in vertical position and no contact is made, and in FIG. 5 as knob of switch is pushed then due to mechanism coupling moving contact (6) becomes inclined and makes contact. If indication tag assembly is removed from the housing (7), red indication flag (5) and green indication flag (4) will be visible completely i.e. in FIG. 4 indication tag assembly is partially removed from housing and in FIG. 5 it is completely removed and red indication flag (5) and green indication flag (4) are completely visible. Green indication flag (4) will also come under indication tag assembly. Green indication flag (4) is directly connected to moving contact (6) with pivot (8). When moving contact (6) becomes inclined (i.e. switch in ON position) as shown in FIG. 5, green indication flag (4) also moves up making red indication flag (5) visible through the indication window (lb).<br>
