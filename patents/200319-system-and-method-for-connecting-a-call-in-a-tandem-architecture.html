A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR CONNECTING A CALL OVER TANDEM CONNECTIONS AND A METHOD THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The	present     invention     relates     to     the     field     of<br>
telecommunications call	switching and transport and, more particularly, to a<br>
communication   system	and   method   for  connecting   a   call   over tandem<br>
connections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Broadband systems provide telecommunications providers with many benefits, including greater bandwidth, more efficient use of bandwidth, and the ability to integrate voice, data, and video communications. These brbadband systems provide callers with increased capabilities at lower costs.<br>
Telecommunications systems often have a hierarchy of switching<br>
systems for connecting calls through local and long distance networks.<br>
Typically, a series of edge switching systems connect to a more core-<br>
type switching system. The edge switching systems connect calls to the<br>
core switching system, and the core switching system	<br>
-1-<br><br>
connects calls to another edge switching system. These core-type switching systems are sometimes referred to as tandem switches.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates such a prior system which has two edge switches 102 and 104 and a tandem switch 106. It will be appreciated that the first edge switch 102 transmits the call to the tandem switch 106, and the tandem switch 106 transmits the call to the edge switch 104.<br>
Typically, tandem switching systems do not provide distributed call processing and call connecting functions. In these systems, the switching matrix is coresident with the call processing. Thus, a system is needed for providing distributed call processing.<br>
In addition, prior systems do not provide telephony call services. Moreover, a tandem-type switching system is needed for asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) call connection systems. Increased speed and efficiencies of cost and processing time can be realized by such a system. The present invention fulfills these needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises a system for connecting a call having call signaling and user communications. The system comprises a signaling processor that receives and processes the call signaling to select an  synchronous transfer mode (ATM) connection for the user communications. The signaling processor transmits a control message identifying the selected ATM connection. An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) matrix receives the user communications over another ATM connection and receives the control message from the signaling processor. In response to the control<br>
2<br><br>
message, the ATM matrix connects the user communications over the selected ATM connection.<br>
The present invention also comprises a system for connecting a call having call signaling and user communications. The system comprises a first switching system that transports the user communications over a first connection. A signaling processor receives and processes the caJI signaling to select a second connection for the user communications. The signaling processor transmits a control message identifying the selected second connection. An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) matrix receives the user communications that were transported over the first connection and receives the control message from the signaling processor. In response to the control message, the ATM matrix connects the user communications over the selected second connection A second switching system receives the user communications that were transported over the second connection.<br>
The present invention also is directed to a system for connecting a call having call signaling and user communications. The system comprises a signaling processor that receives and processes; the call signaling to select a first, second, and third connection for the user communications. The signaling processor transmits a first, second, and third control message identifying the selected first, second, and third connections, respectively. A first interworking unit receives the user communications, receives the first control message, and, in response toe:the first control message, interworks the user communications over the first connection. An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) matrix receives the user communications that were transported over the first connection, receives the second control message, and, in response to the second control<br>
3<br><br>
message, connects the user communications over the selected second connection. A second interworking unit receives the user communications that were connected over the second connection, receives the third control message, and, in response to the third control message, interworks the user communications over the third connection.<br>
Further, the present invention is directed to a method for connecting a call having call signaling and user communications. The method comprises receiving and processing the call signaling to select an ATM connection for the user communications. A control message identifying the selected ATM connection is transmitted. The user communications, are received over another ATM connection at an asynchronous transfer mode matrix, and the control message is received at the asynchronous transfer mode matrix. The user communications are connected over the selected ATM connection in response to the control message using the ATM matrix.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Telecommunication systems have a number of communication devices in<br>
local exchange and interexchange environments that interact to provide call services to<br>
customers. Both traditional and intelligent network (IN) services and resources are used<br>
to process, route, or connect a call to a designated connection.<br>
A   call   has   user   communications   and   call   signaling.   The   user<br>
communications contain the caller's information, such as a voice communication or data communication, and they are transported over a connection. Call signaling contains information that facilitates call processing, and it is communicated over a link. Call signaling, for example, contains information describing the called number and the calling number. Examples of call signaling are standardized signaling, such as signaling system #7 (SS7), C7, integrated services digital network (ISDN), and digital private network signaling system (DPNSS), which are based on ITU recommendation Q.931. A call can . be connected to and from communication devices.<br>
Connections are used to transport user communications and other device information between communication devices and between the elements and devices of the system. The term "connection" as used herein means the transmission media used to carry user communications between elements of the various telecommunications networks and systems. For example, a connection could carry a user's voice, computer<br>
9<br><br>
data, or other communication device data. A connection can be associated with either in-band communications or out-of-band communications.<br>
Links are used to transport call signaling and control messages. The term "link" as used herein means a transmission media used to carry call signaling and control messages. For example, a Jink would carry call signaling or a device control message<br>
containing device instructions and data, A link can carry, for example, out-of-band signaling such as that used in 5S7, C7, ISDN, DPNSS, B-BDN, GR-3G3, or could be via<br>
local area network (LAN), or data bus call signaling. A link cart be, for example, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) adaptation layer 5 (AAL5) data link, user datagram protocol/internet protocol (UDP/EP), ethemet, digital signal level zero (DSO), or digital<br>
signal level one (DSD- lit addition, a link, as shown in the figures, can represent a single physical Jink or muiiiple links, such as one link or a combination of finks of ISDN, SS7» transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IPX or some other data link. The terra "control message" as used herein means a control or signaling message, a coniroi or signaling instruction, or a control or signaling signal, whether proprietary or standardized, that conveys information from one point to another.<br>
The system of the present invention provides distributed call processing and connection functionalities. The present invention includes a system and method for implementing the tandem-type switching system with a switching matrix that can be nonresident from the call processing portion. In addition, the present invention includes a system for providing a tandem switching system for an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network.<br>
10<br><br>
Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a call connection system 202 of the present invention. The call connection system 202 has a tandem system 204 connected to a first switching system 206 and a second switching system 208 through connections 210 and 212, respectively. A connection 214 connects the switching systems 206 and 208. Connections 216 and 218 connect to the first switching system 206, and connections 220 and 222 connect to the second switching system 208.<br>
The tandem system. 204 connects calls between the switching systems 206 and 208 and with other communications devices (not shown). The tandem system 204 switches calls at the ATM layer. In addition, time division multiplex (TDM) based calls can be connected by the tandem system 204.<br>
The tandem system 204 provides real time call control for telephony services on a switching platform. In addition, the tandem system 204 provides overflow routing so that it handles calls from other switching systems and devices which have an actual or potential degradation of quality of service (QoS). Moreover, in addition to providing basic tandem routing functions, the tandem system 204 provides survivability for networks so that alternate routes between the switching systems 206 and 208 and between other system devices (not shown) are,available. <br>
The switching systems 206 and 208 connect calls to and from the tandem system 204 and to and from each other. The switching systems 206 and 208 comprise a tandem system, such as the tandem system 204 or the tandem system to be described below, customer premises equipment (CPE), an ATM switch, a TDM switch, a remote digital terminal, a cross connect, an interworking unit, an ATM gateway, or any other devicexapable of handling a call. CPE can be, for example, a computer,a private branch<br>
11<br><br>
exchange, or other communication device. An ATM gateway is a device that changes ATM cell header virtual path/virtual channel (VP/VC) identifiers.<br>
In one embodiment, the tandem system 204 comprises a signaling processor 224 and an ATM matrix 226 linked by a link 228. A first link 230 and a second link 232 extend from the signaling processor 224.<br>
The signaling processor 224 is a signaling platform that can receive, process, and generate call signaling. Based on the processed call signaling, the signaling processor 224 selects processing options, services, or resources for the user communications and generates and transmits control messages that identify the communication device, processing option, service, or resource that is to be used. The signaling processor 224 also selects virtual connections and circuit-based connections for call routing and generates and transports control messages that identify the selected connections. The signaling processor 224 can process various forms of signaling, including ISDN, GR-303, B-ISDN, SS7, and C7.<br>
The ATM matrix 226 is a controllable ATM matrix that establishes<br>
connections in response to control messages received from the signaling processor 224.<br>
The ATM matrix 226 is able to interwork between ATM connections and time division<br>
multiplex (TDM) connections.  The ATM  matrix 226  also cross connects  ATM<br>
connections with other ATM connections. In addition, the ATM matrix 226 can switch<br>
calls from TDM connections to other TDM connections. The ATM matrix 226 transmits<br>
 and receives call signaling and user communications over the connections. Typically, the<br>
 ATM matrix 226 transmits call signaling to and from the signaling processor 224.<br>
12<br><br>
The system of Figure 2 operates as follows. In a first example, a call is handled by the first switching system 206. In this example, the first switching system 206 is a local exchange carrier (LEC) switch. The user communications are transported from the first switching system 206 to the ATM matrix over the connection 210, Call signaling is received by the signaling processor 224 over the link 230.<br>
The signaling processor 224 processes the call signaling to determine a connection for the call. The signaling processor 224 selects the connection 212 for the call and transmits a control message to the ATM matrix 226 identifying the selected connection. The signaling processor 224 also transmits new call signaling over the link 232.<br>
The ATM matrix 226 receives the user communications over the connection 210 and receives the control message over the link 228. In response to the control message, the ATM matrix 226 connects the user communications to the selected connection 212, and the call is received by the second switching system 208. In this example, the connection 212 is an ATM connection.<br>
In another example, the first switching system 206 is a tandem system of the present invention, such as the tandem system 204 or- the tandem system to be described below, and the second switching system 208. is another type of switch. In this example, the connection 214 would be the preferable connection from the first switching system 206 to the second switching system 208. However, the connection 214 is not available. As a survivability measure, the call is alternately routed through the tandem system 204.<br>
13<br><br>
The first switching system 206 transports user communications to the ATM matrix 226 over the connection 210. In this example, the connection 210 is an ATM connection. The call signaling is transmitted from the first switching system 206 to the signaling processor 224 through a link (not shown).<br>
The signaling processor 224 processes the call signaling to determine a connection for the call. The signaling processor 224 selects the connection 212 for the call and transmits a control message to the ATM matrix 226 identifying the selected connection. In addition, the signaling processor 224 transmits new call signaling to the second switching system 208 over a link (not shown) identifying the connection 212 over which the user communications will be transported.<br>
The ATM matrix 226 receives the user communications over the connection 210 and receives the control message over the link 228. In response to the control message, the ATM matrix 226 connects the call to the selected connection 212. The second switching system 208 receives the user communications over the connection 212 and the call signaling over a link (not shown). In this example, the connection 212 is an ATM connection.<br>
In another example, the first and second switching systems 206 and 208 are tandem systems of the present invention, such as the tandem system 204 or the tandem system to be described below. In this example, the connection 210 is an ATM connection. Also, in this example, the connection 214 would be the preferable connection from the switching system 206 to the second switching system 208. However, the connection 214 is not available due to high traffic usage and degradation of QoS. As a call control measure, the call is routed through the tandem system 204.<br>
14<br><br>
The switching system 206 transports the user communications to the ATM matrix 226 over a VP/VC on the connection 210 to the ATM matrix 226. The first switching system 206 transmits the call signaling over another VP/VC on the connection 210 to the ATM matrix 226. The ATM matrix 226 then transmits the call signaling to the signaling processor 224 over the link 228.<br>
The signaling processor 224 processes the call signaling to determine a connection for the call. The signaling processor 224 selects the connection 212 for the call. The signaling processor 224 transmits call signaling to the ATM matrix 226 and transmits a control message to the ATM matrix 226 identifying the selected connection for the user communications and, in some instances, a connection for the call signaling.<br>
The ATM matrix 226 receives the user communications over the connection 210 and receives the control message and the call signaling over the link 228. In response to the control message, the ATM matrix 226 connects the user communications to the selected VP/VC on the connection 212 and transmits the call signaling on another VP/VC on the connection 212. In this example, the connection 212 is an ATM connection. The second switching system 208 receives the call signaling and the user communications over the respective VP/VCs on the connection 212.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates another embodiment of a call connection system 202A with a tandem system 204A of the present invention. The tandem system 204A comprises a signaling processor 224A, an ATM matrix 226A, a first interworking unit 302, and a second interworking unit 304. The signaling processor 224A and the ATM matrix 226A are the same as those elements described above.<br>
15<br><br>
The ATM matrix is connected to the first interworking unit 302 by a connection 306 and to the second interworking unit 304 by a connection 308. Two connections 310 and 312 extend from the ATM matrix 226A. A connection 314 connects the first interworking unit 302 wilh the second interworking unit 304. A connection 316 i connects to the first interworking unit 302, and a connection 318 connects to the second interworking unit 304.<br>
The interworking units 302 and 304 interwork traffic between various protocols. Preferably, the interworking units 302 and 304 interwork between ATM traffic and non-ATM traffic. The interworking units 302 and 304 operate in accordance with control messages received from the call processor 224A. These control messages typically are provided on a call-by-call basis and typically identify an assignment between a DS0 and a VP/VC for which user communications are interworked. In some instances, the interworking units 302 and 304 may transport control messages which may include data to the call processor 224A.<br>
The system of Figure 3 operates as follows. In a first example, the signaling processor 224A receives call signaling, and the first interworking unit 302 receives the user communications over the connection 316.<br>
The signaling processor 224A processes the call signaling to determine connections for the call. In this example, the connection 314 is the preferred connection for-the call, but it is not available. The signaling processor 224A selects the connections 306, 308, and 318 for the call. The signaling processor 224A transmits a control message to each of the first interworking unit 302, the ATM matrix 226A, and the second<br>
16<br><br>
interworking unit 304 identifying the respective connections 306, 308, and 318 for the call.<br>
The first interworking unit 302 receives the user communications and the control message. In response to the control message, the first interworking unit 302 interworks the user communications to the selected connection 306. Preferably, the first intenvorking unit 302 interworks the user communications from TDM to ATM.<br>
The ATM matrix 226A receives the user communications and the control message. In response to the control message, the ATM matrix 226A connects the user communications from the connection 306 to the selected connection 308.<br>

The control interface 504 receives control messages originating from the signaling processor 522, identifies DS0 and virtual connection assignments in the control messages, and provides these assignments to the AAL 514 or the matrix 516 for implementation.

The call signaling may be connected on a connection or transmitted to the control interface directly or via an interface as explained above.<br>
The AAL 514 comprises both a convergence sublayer and a segmentation and reassembly (SAR) sublayer. The AAL 514 obtains the identity of the DSO and the ATM VP/VC from the control interface 504. The AAL 514 is operational to convert between the DSO format and the ATM format. AALs are known in the artT and information about AALs is provided by International Telecommunications Union (ITU) documents in the series of 1.363, which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, ITU document 1.363.1 discusses AAL1. An AAL for voice calls is described in U.S. Patent Number 5,806,553 entitled "Cell Processing for Voice Transmission," which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Calls with multiple 64 Kilo-bits per second (Kbps) DSOs are known as Nx64 calls. If desired, the AAL 514 can be configured to accept control messages through the control interface 504 for Nx64 calls. The CAM 502 is able to interwork, multiplex, and demultiplex for multiple DSOs.

23<br><br>
entitled "Telecommunications System with a Connection Processing System," and which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
DSO connections are bi-directional and ATM connections are typically uni-directional. As a result, two virtual connections in opposing directions typically will be required for each DSO. Those skilled in the art will appreciate how this can be accomplished in the context of the invention. For example, the cross-connect can be provisioned with a second set of VP/VCs in the opposite direction as the original set of VP/VCs.<br>
The matrix 516 is a controllable ATM matrix that provides cross connect functionality in response to control messages from the signaling processor 522. The matrix 516 has access to VP/VCs over which it can connect calls.

In these embodiments, a signal processor may be included. The signaling processor 522 is configured to send control messages to the CAM 502 to implement particular features on particular DSO or VP/VC circuits. Alternatively,<br>

THE SIGNALING PROCESSOR<br>
The signaling processor receives and processes telecommunications call signaling, control messages, and customer data to select connections that establish communication paths for calls. In the preferred embodiment, the signaling processor processes SS7 signaling to select connections for a call. An example of call processing in a call processor and the associated maintenance that is performed for call processing is described in a U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 09/026,766 entitled "System and Method for Treating a Call for Call Processing," which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
30<br><br>
In addition to selecting connections, the signaling processor performs many other functions in the context of call processing. It not only can control routing and select the actual connections, but it also can validate callers, control echo cancellers, generate accounting information, invoke intelligent network functions, access remote databases, manage traffic, and balance network loads. One skilled in the art will appreciate how the signaling processor described below can be adapted to operate in the above embodiments.<br>
Figure 8 depicts an embodiment of a signaling processor. Other versions also are contemplated. In the embodiment of Figure 8, the signaling processor 802 has a signaling interface 804, a call processing control system 806 (CPCS), and a call processor 808. It will be appreciated that the signaling processor 802 may be constructed as modules in a single unit or as multiple units.<br>
The signaling interface 804 is coupled externally to signaling systems -preferably to signaling systems having a message transfer part (MTP), an ISDN user part (ISUP), a signaling connection control part (SCCP), an intelligent network application part (INAP), and a transaction capabilities application part (TCAP). The signaling interface 804 preferably is a platform that comprises an MTP level 1 810, an MTP level 2 812, an MTP level 3 814, an SCCP process 816, an ISUP process 818, and a TCAP process 820. The signaling interface 804 also has INAP functionality.<br>
The signaling interface 804 may be linked to a communication device (not shown). For example, the communication device may be an SCP which is queried by the signaling interface with a TCAP query to obtain additional call-associated data. The<br>
31<br><br>
answer message may have additional information parameters that are required to complete call processing. The communication device also may be an STP or other device. The signaling interface 804 is operational to transmit, process, and receive call signaling. The TCAP, SCCP, ISUP, and INAP functionality use the services of the MTP to transmit and receive the messages. Preferably, the signaling interface 804 transmits and receives SS7 messages for MTP, TCAP, SCCP, and ISUP. Together, this functionality is referred to as an "SS7 stack," and it is well known. The software required by one skilled in the art to configure an SS7 stack is commercially available. One example is the OMNI SS7 stack from Dale, Gesek , McWilliams &amp; Sheridan, Inc. (the DGM&amp;S company).<br>
The processes of the signaling interface 804 process information that is received in message signal units (MSUs) and convert the information to call information elements that are sent to the call processor 808 to be processed. A call information element may be, for example, an ISUP IAM message parameter from the MSU. The signaling interface 804 strips the unneeded header information from the MSU to isolate the message information parameters and passes the parameters to the call processor 808 as the call information eIements.\Examples of these parameters are the called number, the calling number, and user service information. Other examples of messages with information elements are an ANM, an ACM, an REL, an RLC, and an INF. bi addition, call information elements are transferred from the call processor 808 back to the signaling interface 804, and the information elements are reassembled into MSUs and transferred to a signaling point.<br>
32<br><br>
The CPCS 806 is a management and administration system. The CPCS 806 is the user interface and external systems interface into the call processor 808. The CPCS 806 serves as a collection point for call-associated data such as logs, operational measurement data, statistical information, accounting information, and other call data. The CPCS 806 can configure the call-associated data and/or transmit it to reporting centers.<br>
The CPCS 806 accepts data, such as the translations, from a source such as an operations system and updates the data in the tables in the call processor 808. The CPCS 806 ensures that this data is in the correct format prior to transferring the data to the call processor 808. The CPCS 806 also provides configuration data to other devices including the call processor 808, the signaling interface 804, the interworking unit (not shown), and the controllable ATM matrix (not shown). In addition, the CPCS 806 provides for remote control of call monitoring and call tapping applications from the call processor 808.<br>
The CPCS 806 also serves as a collection point for alarms. Alarm information is transferred to the CPCS 806. The CPCS 806 then transports alarm messages to the required communication device. For example, the CPCS 806 can transport alarms to an operations center.<br>
The CPCS 806 also has a human-machine interface (HMI). This allows a person to log onto the CPCS 806 and manage data tables or review data tables in the CPCS or provide maintenance services.<br>
The call processor 808 processes call signaling and controls an ATM interworking unit,  such as  an ATM  interworking  multiplexer (mux) that performs<br>
33<br><br>
interworking of DSOs and VP/VCs, and an ATM matrix. However, the call processor 808 may control other communications devices and connections in other embodiments.<br>
The  call   processor  808  comprises  a  control   platform   822   and   an application platform 824. Each platform 822 and 824 is coupled to the other platform.<br>
The control platform 822 is comprised of various external interfaces including an interworking unit interface, a controllable ATM matrix, an echo interface, a resource control interface, a call information interface, and an operations interface. The control platform 822 is externally coupled to an interworking unit control, a controllable ATM matrix control, an echo control, a resource control, accounting, and operations. The interworking unit interface exchanges messages with at least one interworking unit. These messages   comprise   DSO   to   VP/VC   assignments,   acknowledgments,   and   status information. The controllable ATM matrix interface exchanges messages with at least one controllable ATM matrix. These messages comprise DSO to VP/VC assignments, VP/VC to VP/VC assignments, acknowledgments, and status information. The echo control interface exchanges messages with echo control systems. Messages exchanged with  echo control  systems  might include  instructions  to enable or disable echo cancellation on particular DSOs, acknowledgments, and status information.<br>
The   resource   control   interface   exchanges   messages   with   external. resources. Examples of such resources are devices that implement continuity testing,. encryption,   compression,   tone   detection/transmission,   voice   detection,   and   voice messaging. The messages exchanged with resources are instructions to apply the resource to particular. DSOs, acknowledgments, and status information. For example,-a message<br>
34<br><br>
may instruct a continuity testing resource to provide a loopback or to send and detect a tone for a continuity test.<br>
The call information interface transfers pertinent call information to a call information processing system, such as to the CPCS 806. Typical call information includes accounting information, such as the parties to-the call, time points for the call, and any special features applied to the call. One skilled in the art will appreciate how to produce the software for the interfaces in the control platform 822.<br>
The application platform 824 processes signaling information from the signaling interface 804 to select connections. The identity of the selected connections are provided to the control platform 822 for the interworking unit interface and/or for the controllable ATM matrix interface. The application platform 824 is responsible for validation, translation, routing, call control, exceptions, screening, and error handling. In addition to providing the control requirements for the interworking unit and the controllable ATM matrix, the application platform 824 also provides requirements for echo control and resource control to the appropriate interface of the control platform 822. In addition, the application platform 824 generates signaling information for transmission by the signaling interface 804. The signaling information might be for ISUP, INAP, or TCAP messages to.external network elements. Pertinent information for each call is stored in an enhanced circuit data block (ECDB) for the call. The ECDB can be used for tracking and accounting the call.<br>
The application platform 824 preferably operates in general accord with the Basic Call State Model (BCSM) defined by the ITU. An instance of the BCSM is created to handle each call. The BCSM includes an originating process and a terminating<br>
35<br><br>
process. The application platform 824 includes a service switching function (SSF) that is used to invoke the service control function (SCI7). Typically, the SCF is contained in an SCP. The SCF is queried with TCAP or INAP messages that are transported by the signaling interface 804 and which are initiated with information from the SSF in the application platform 824. The originating or terminating processes will access remote databases with intelligent network (IN) functionality via the SSF.<br>
Software requirements for the application platform 824 can be produced in specification and description language (SDL) defined in ITU-T Z.100 or similar logic or description languages. The SDL can be converted into C code. A real time case tool such as SDT from Telelogic, Inc. or Object Time from Object Time, Inc. can be used. Additional C and C++ code can be added as required to establish the environment. It will be appreciated that other software languages and tools may be used.<br>
The call processor 808 can be comprised of the above-described software loaded onto a computer. The computer can be a generally available fault-tolerant Unix computer, such as those provided by Sun, Tandem, or Hewlett Packard. It may be desirable to utilize the multi-threading capability of a Unix operating system.<br>
From Figure-8. it can be seen that the application platform 824 processes signaling information to control numerous systems and facilitate call connections and services. The SS7 signaling is exchanged between the call processor 808 and external components through the signaling interface 804, and control information is exchanged with external systems through the control platform 822. Advantageously, the signaling interface 804, the CPCS 806, and the call processor 808 are not integrated into a switch central processing unit (CPU) that is coupled to a switching matrix. Unlike an SCP, the<br>
36<br><br>
components of the signaling processor 802 are capable of processing ISUP messages independently of TCAP queries.<br>

CALL PROCESSOR TABLES<br>
38<br><br>
Call processing typically entails two aspects. First, an incoming-or "originating" connection is recognized by an originating call process. For example, the initial connection that a call uses to enter a network is the originating connection in that network. Second, an outgoing or "terminating" connection is selected by a terminating call process. For example, the terminating connection, is coupled to the originating connection in order to extend the call through the network. These two aspects of call processing are referred to as the originating side of the call and the terminating side of the call.<br>
Figure 9 depicts an exemplary data structure preferably used by the call processor 802 of Figure 8 to execute the BCSM. This is accomplished through a series of tables that point to one another in various ways. The pointers typically are comprised of next function and next label designations. The next function points to the next table, and the next label points to an entry or a range of entries in that table. It will be appreciated that the pointers for the main call processing are illustrated in Figure 9.<br>
The primary data structure has a TDM trunk circuit table 902, an ATM trunk circuit table 904, a trunk group table 906, a carrier table 908, an exception table 910, an originating line information (OLI) table 912, an automatic number identification (ANI) table 914, a called number screening table 916, a called number table 918/a routing table 920, a trunk group class of service (COS) table 922, and a message mapping table. 924. Also included in the data structure are a day of year table 926, a day of week table 928, a time of day table 930, and a time zone table 932.<br>
The TDM trunk circuit table 902 contains information required to provision the TDM side of a connection from the call processor site. Each circuit on the<br>
39<br><br>
TDM side of a connection has an entry. The TDM trunk circuit table 902 is accessed from the trunk group table 906 or an external call process, and it points to the trunk group table.<br>
The ATM trunk circuit table 904 contains information required to provision the ATM side of a connection. Typically, one record appears in this table per ATM trunk group. Although, the system can be configured alternately for multiple records per trunk group. The ATM trunk circuit table 904 is accessed from the trunk group table 906 or an external call process, and it points to the trunk group table.<br>
The trunk group table 906 contains information that is required to build trunk groups out of different trunk members identified in the TDM and ATM trunk circuit tables 902 and 904. The trunk group table 906 contains information related to the originating and terminating trunk groups. The trunk group table 906 typically points to the carrier table 908. Although, the trunk group table 906 may point to the exception table 910, the OU table 912, the ANI table 914, the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the routing table 920, the day of year table 926, the day of week table 928, the time of day table 930, and the treatment table (see Figure 10).<br>
For default processing of an IAM of an outgoing call in the forward direction, when the call process determines call setup and routing parameters for user communications on the originating portion, the trunk group table 906 is the next table after the TDM and ATM trunk circuit tables 902 and 904, and the trunk group table points to the carrier table 908. For default processing of-an IAM of an outgoing call in the forward direction, when the call process determines call setup and routing parameters for user communications on the terminating portion, the trunk group table 906 is the next<br>
40<br><br>
table after the routing table 920, and the trunk group table points to the TDM or ATM trunk circuit table 902 or 904. For default processing of an ACM or an ANM of an outgoing call in the originating direction, when the call process determines parameters for signaling, the trunk group table 906 is the next table after the TDM or ATM trunk circuit table 902 or 904, and the trunk group table points to the message mapping table 924. It will be appreciated that this is the default method, and, as explained herein, other implementations of table processing occur.<br>
The carrier table 908 contains information that allows calls to be screened based, at least in part, on the carrier information parameter and the carrier selection parameter. The carrier table 908 typically points to the exception table 910. Although, the carrier table 908 may point to the OLI table 912, the ANI table 914, the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the routing table 920, the day of year table 926, the day of week table 928, the time of day table 930, the treatment table (see Figure 10), and the database services table (see Figure 11).<br>
The exception table 910 is used to identify various exception conditions related to the call that may influence the routing or handling of the call. The exception table 910 contains information that allows cal&amp;to be screened based, at least in part, on the called party number and the calling party's category. The exception table 910 typically points to the OLI table 912. Although, the exception table 910 can point to the ANI table 914^ihe called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the routing table 920, the day of year table 926, the day of week table 928, the time of day table 930, the call rate table, the percent control table, the treatment table (see Figure 10), and the database services table (see Figure 11).<br>
41<br><br>
The OLI table 912 contains information that allows calls to be screened based, at least in part, on originating line information in an IAM. The OLI table 912 typically points to the ANI table 914. Although, the OLI table can point to the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the routing table 920, the day of year table 926, the day of week table 928, the time of day table 930, and the treatment table (see Figure 10).<br>
The ANI table 914 is used to identify any special characteristics related to the caller's number, which is commonly known as automatic number identification. The ANI table 914 is used to screen and validate an incoming ANI. ANI specific requirements such as queuing, echo cancellation, time zone, and treatments can be established. The ANI table 914 typically points to the called number screening table 916. Although, the ANI table 914 can point to the called number table 918, the routing table 920, the day of year table 926, the day of week table 928, the time of day table 930, and the treatment table (see Figure 10).<br>
The called number screening table 916 is used to screen called numbers. The called number screening table 916 determines the disposition of the called number and the nature of the called number. The called number screening table 916 is used to provide the trigger detection point (TDP) for an AIN SCP TCAP query. It is used, for example, with the local number portability (LNP) feature. The called number screening table can invoke a TCAP. The called number screening table 916 typically points to the called number table 918. Although, the called number screening table 916 can point to the routing table 920, the treatment table, the call rate table, the percent table (see Figure 10), and the database services table (see Figure 11).<br>
42<br><br>
The called number table 918 is used to identify routing requirements based on, for example, the called number. This will be the case for standard calls. The called number table 918 typically points to the routing table 910. In addition, the called number table 926 can be configured to alternately point to the day of year table 926. The called number table 918 can also point to the treatment table (see Figure 10) and the database services table (see Figure 1 1).<br>
The routing table 920 contains information relating to the routing of a call for various connections. The routing table 920 typically points to the treatment table (see Figure 10), Although, the routing table also can point to the trunk group table 906 and the database services table (see Figure II).<br>
For default processing of an IAM of an outgoing call in the forward direction, when the call process determines call setup and routing parameters for user communications, the routing table 920 is the next table after the called number table 918, and the routing table points to the trunk group table 906. For default processing of an IAM of an outgoing call in the forward direction, when the call process determines parameters for signaling, the routing table 920 is the next table after the called number table 918, and the routing table points to the message mapping table 924. It will be appreciated that this is the default method, and, as explained herein, other implementations of table processing occur.<br>
The trunk group COS table 922 contains information that allows calls to be routed differently based on the class of service assigned to the originating trunk group and to the terminating trunk group. The trunk group COS table can point to the routing table 920 or the treatment table (see Figure 10).<br>
43<br><br>
When (he trunk group COS table 922 is used in processing, after the routing table 920 and the trunk group table 906 are processed, the trunk group table points to the trunk group COS table. The trunk group COS table points back to the routing table 920 for further processing. Processing then continues with the routing table 920 which points to the trunk group table 906, and the trunk group table which points to the TDM or ATM trunk circuit table 902 or 904. It will be appreciated that this is the default method, and, as explained herein, other implementations of table processing occur.<br>
The message mapping table 924 is used to provide instructions for the formatting of signaling messages from the call processor. It typically can be accessed by the routing table 920 or the trunk group table 906 and typically determines the format of the outgoing messages leaving the call processor.<br>
The day of year table 926 contains information that allows calls to be routed differently based on the day of the year. The day of year table typically points to the routing table 920 and references the time zone table 932 for information. The day of year table 926 also can point to the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the routing table 920, the day of week table 928, the time of day table 930, and the treatment table (see Figure 10).<br>
The day of week table 928 contains information that allows calls to be routed differently based on the day of the week. The day of week table typicaJly points to the routing table 920 and references the time zone table 932 for information. The day of week table.928 also can point to the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the time of day table 930, and the treatment table (see Figure 10).<br>
44<br><br>
The time of day table 930 contains information that allows calls to be routed differently based on the time of me day. The time of day table 930 typically points to the routing table 920 and references the time zone table 932 for information. The time of day table 930 also can point to the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, and the treatment table (see Figure 10).<br>
The time zone table 932 contains information that allows call processing to determine if the time associated with the call processing should be offset based on the time zone or daylight savings time. The time zone table 932 is referenced by, and provides information to, the day of year table 926, the day of week table 928, and the time of day table 930.<br>
Figure 10 is an overlay of Figure 9. The tables from Figure 9 are present. However, for clarity, the table's pointers have been omitted, and some tables have not been duplicated in Figure 10. Figure 10 illustrates additional tables that can be accessed from the tables of Figure 9. These include an outgoing release table 1002, a treatment table 1004, a call rate table 1006, and a percent control table 1008, and time/date tables 1010.<br>
The outgoing release table 1002 contains information that allows call processing to determine how an outgoing release message is to be formatted. The outgoing release table 1002 typically points to the treatment table 1006.<br>
The treatment table 1004 identifies various special' actions to be taken in the course of call processing. For example, based on the incoming trunk group or ANI, different treatments or cause codes are used to convey problems to the called and calling parties. This typically will result in the transmission of a release message (REL) and a<br>
45<br><br>
cause value. The treatment table 1004 typically points to the outgoing release table 1002 and the database services table (see Figure 11).<br>
The call rate table 1006 contains information that is used to control call attempts on an attempt per second basis. Preferably, attempts from 100 per second to I per minute are programmable. The call rate table 1006 typically points to the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the routing table 920, and the treatment table 1004.<br>
The percent control .table 1008 contains information that is used to control call attempts based upon a percent value of the traffic that is processed through call processing. The percent control table 1008 typically points to the called number screening table 916, the called number table 918, the routing table 920, and the treatment table 1004.<br>
The date/time tables 1010 have been identified in Figure 9 as the day of year table 926, the day of week table 928, the time of day table 926, and the time zone table 932. They are illustrated in Figure 10 as a single location for ease and clarity but need not be so located.<br>
Figure 11 is an overlay of Figures 9-10. The tables from Figures 9-10 are present. However, for clarity, the table's pointers have been omitted, and some tables have not been duplicated in Figure 11.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates additional tables that can be accessed from the tables of Figures 9-10 and which are directed to the TCAP and the SCCP message processes. These include a database services table 1102, a signaling connection control part (SCCP) table   1104,  an  intermediate signaling  network  identification   (ISNI)  table   1106,  a<br>
46<br><br>
transaction capabilities application part (TCAP) table 1108, and an advanced intelligent network (AIN) event parameters table 1110.<br>
The database services table 1102 contains information about the type of database service requested by call processing. The database services table 1102 references and obtains information from the SCCP table 1104 and the TCAP table 1108. After the database function is performed, the call is returned to normal call processing. The database services table 1102 points to the called number table 918.<br>
The SCCP table 1104 contains information and parameters required to build an SCCP message. The SCCP table 1104 is referenced by the database services table 1102 and provides information to the database services table.<br>

Figure 12 is an overlay of Figures 9-11. The tables from Figures 9-11 are present. However, for clarity, the tables have not been duplicated in Figure 12. Figure 12 illustrates additional tables that can be used to setup the cail process so that the tables of<br>
47<br><br>
Figures 9-11 may be used. These setup tables 1202 include a site office table 1204, an external echo canceller table 1206, an interworking unit (IWU) table 1208, a controllable ATM matri_x (CAM) interface table 1210, and a controllable ATM matrix (CAM) table 1212.<br>
;	The site office table 1204 contains information which lists office-wide<br>
parameters, some of which are information-based and others which affect call processing.<br>
The site office table 1204 provides information to the call processor or switch during<br>
initialization  or other setup  procedures,  such  as population  of data or transfer of<br>
information to one or more memory locations for use during call processing,<br>
	The external echo canceller 1206 contains information that provides the<br>
interface identifier and the echo canceller type when an external echo canceller is required. The external echo canceller table 1206 provides information to the call processor or switch during initialization or other setup procedures, such as population of data or transfer of information to one or more memory locations for use during call processing.<br>
The IWU table 1208 contains the internet protocol (IP) identification numbers for interfaces to the interworking units at the call processor or switch site. The IWU table 1208 provides information to the call processor or switch during initialization or other setup procedures, such as population of data or transfer of information to one or more memory locations for use during call processing.<br>
The CAM interface table 1210 contains information for the logical interfaces associated with the CAM. The CAM interface table 1210 provides information to the call processor or switch during initialization or other setup procedures, such as.<br>
48<br><br>
population of data or transfer of information to one or more memory locations for use during call processing.<br>
The CAM table 1212 contains information associated with the logical and physical setup properties of the CAM. The CAM table 1212 provides information to the call processor or switch during initialization or other setup procedures, such as population of data or transfer of information to one or more memory locations for use during call processing.<br>
Figures 13-42 depict examples of the various tables described above. It will be appreciated that other versions of tables may be used. In addition, information from the identified tables may be combined or changed to form different tables.<br>
Figure 13 depicts an example of a TDM trunk circuit table. The TDM trunk circuit table is used to access information about the originating circuit for originating circuit call processing. It also is used to provide information about the terminating circuit for terminating circuit call processing. The trunk group number of the circuit associated with the call is used to enter the table. The group member is the second entry that is used as a key to identifyor fill information in the table. The group member identifies the member number or the trunk group to which the circuit is assigned, and it is used for the circuit selection control.<br>
The table also contains the trunk circuit identification code (TCIC). The TCIC identifies the trunk circuit which is typically a DSOj.The echo canceller (EC) label entry identifies the echo canceller, if any, which  is connected to the circuit. The" interworking unit (IWU) label and the interworking unit (IWU) port identify the hardware location and the port number, respectively, of the interworking unit. The DS1/E1 label<br>
49<br><br>
and the DS1/E1 channel denote the DS1 or (he HI and the channel within the DS1 or El, respectively, that contains the circuit. The initial state specifies the slate of the circuit when it is installed. Valid states include blocked if the circuit is installed and blocked from usage, unequipped if the circuit is reserved, and normal if the circuit is installed and available from usage.<br>
Figure 14 depicts an example of an ATM trunk circuit table. The ATM trunk circuit table is used to access information about the originating circuit for originating circuit call processing. It also is used to provide information about the terminating circuit for terminating circuit call processing.<br>
The trunk group number of the circuit associated with the call is used to enter the table. The group size denotes the number of members in the trunk group. The starting trunk circuit identification code (TCIC) is the starting TCIC for the trunk group, and it is used in the routing label of an ISUP message. The transmit interface label identifies the hardware location of the virtual path on which the call will be transmitted. The transmit interface label may designate either an interworking unit interface or a CAM interface for the designated trunk members. The transmit virtual path identifier (VPI) is the VP that will be used on the transmission circuit side of the call. The receive interface label identifies the hardware location of the virtual path on which the call will be received. The receive interface label may designate either an interworking unit interface or a^CAM interface for the designated trunk members. The receive virtual path identifier (VPI) is the VP that will be used on the reception circuit side of the call. The initial state specifies the state of the circuit when it is installed. Valid states include blocked if the<br>
50<br><br>
circuit is installed and blocked from usage, unequipped if the circuit is reserved, and normal if the circuit is installed and available from usage.<br>
Figure 15A depicts an example of a trunk group table. The trunk group number of the trunk group associated with the circuit is used to key into the trunk group table. The administration information field is used for information purposes concerning the trunk group and typically is not used in call processing. The associated point code is the point code for the far end switch or call processor to which the trunk group is connected. The common language location identifier (CLLI) entry is a standardized Bellcore entry for the associated office to which the trunk group is connected. The trunk type identifies the type of the trunk in the trunk group. The trunk type may be a TDM trunk, an ATM trunk from the interworking unit, or an ATM trunk from the CAM.<br>
The associated numbering plan area (NPA) contains information identifying the switch from which the trunk group is originating or to which the trunk group is terminating. The associated jurisdiction information parameter (JIP) contains information identifying the switch from which the trunk group is originating or to which the trunk group is terminating. If an ISUP JIP is not received in an IAM, the default JIP is a value recorded on the call processor ECDB. If an incoming IAM does not have a JIP, call processing will populate the JIP of the outgoing IAM with the default value from the trunk group table. If a JEP is not data filled, an outgoing JIP is not transmitted.<br>
The time zone label identifies the time zone that should be used when computing a local date and a local time for use with a day of year table, the day of week table, and the time of day table. The echo canceller information field describes the trunk group echo cancellation requirements. Valid entries for the echo canceller information<br>
51<br><br>
include normal for a trunk group that uses internal echo cancellation, external for a trunk group that requires external echo cancellers, and disable for a trunk group that requires no echo cancellation for any call passing over the group.<br>
Figure I5B is a continuation of Figure 15A for the trunk group table. The satellite entry specifies that the trunk group for the circuit is connected through a satellite. If the trunk group uses too many satellites, then a call should not use the identified trunk group. This field is used in conjunction with the nature of connection satellite indicator field from the incoming IAM to determine if the outgoing call can be connected over this trunk group. The select sequence indicates the methodology that will be used to select a connection. Valid entries for the select sequence field include the following: most idle, least idle, ascending, or descending. The interworking unit (IWU) priority signifies that outgoing calls will attempt to use a trunk circuit on the same interworking unit before using a trunk circuit on a different interworking unit.<br>
Glare resolution indicates how a glare situation is to be resolved. Glare is the dual seizure of the same circuit. If the glare resolution entry is set to "even/odd," the switch or the call processor with the higher point code value will control the even number TCICs within the trunk group. The switch or call processor with the lower point code value will control the odd number TCICs. If the glare resolution entry is set to "all," the call processor controls all of the TCICs within the trunk group. If the glare resolution entry is set to "none," the call processor will have no glare control and will yield to all double seizures within the trunk group.<br>
Continuity control indicates whether continuity is to be -checked. Continuity for outgoing calls on the originating call processor are controlled on a trunk<br>
52<br><br>
group basis. This field specifies whether continuity is not required or whether continuity is required and the frequency of the required check. The field identifies a percentage of the calls that require continuity check.<br>
The reattempt entry specifies how many times the outgoing call will be re-attempted using a different circuit from the same trunk group after a continuity check failure, a glare, or other connection failure. The ignore local number portability (LNP) information specifies whether or not the incoming LNP information is ignored. The treatment label is a label into the treatment table for the trunk group used on the call. Because specific trunk group connections may require specific release causes or treatments for a specific customer, this field identifies the type of treatment that is required. The message mapping label is a label into the message mapping table which specifies the backward message configuration that will be used on the trunk group.<br>
Figure 15C is a continuation of Figure I5B for the trunk group table. The queue entry signifies that the terminating part of the trunk group is capable of queuing calls originating from a subscriber that called a number which terminates in this trunk group. The ring no answer entry specifies whether the trunk group requires ring no answer timing. If the entry is set to 0, the call processing will not use the ring no answer timing for calls terminated on the trunk group. A number other than 0 specifies the ring no answer timing in seconds for calls terminating on this trunk group. The voice path cut through entry identifies how and when the terminating call's voice path will be cut through on the trunk group. The options for this field include the following: connect for a cut through in both directions after receipt of an AGM, answer for cut through in the backward direction upon receipt of an ACM, then cut through in the forward direction<br>
53<br><br>
upon receipt of an ANM, or immediate for cut through in both directions immediately after an IAM has been sent<br>
The originating class of service (COS) label provides a label into a class of service table that determines how a call is handled based on the combination of the originating COS and the terminating COS from another trunk group. Based on the combination of this field and the terminating COS of another trunk group's field, the call will be handled differently.
