				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to fluid-operated power<br>
tools. More particularly, it relates to power tools with interchangeable, lever-<br>
drive mechanisms for a variety of bolting applications.<br>
Fluid operated powertools of this general type are known in the<br>
art. Some of such tools are disclosed in U.S. patents nos. 6,260,444 and<br>
6,427,559. In such tools lever-drive mechanisms can be interchanged for<br>
different bolting operations. Limited clearance, fluid-operated tools have an<br>
attachable hex link which contains a lever-drive mechanism and forms one<br>
housing, while another motor housing contains a fluid-operated drive unit.<br>
In all such tools the exchangeable link of one housing is connected to the<br>
other motor housing via screws and pins after the housings are assembled<br>
with one another. As a result, such screws and pins can loosen during the'<br>
operation and end up inside a turbine, a compressor, or another equipment<br>
if they fall off during assembly. There are very strict requirements for such<br>
equipment, for example for turbines in that the turbine can not be fired up if<br>
there is any foreign material inside it, since it can cause the turbine blades<br>
to break off at high speeds and destroy the entire turbine. If pins or screws<br>
or other parts drop during assembly into the interior of the turbine, the<br><br>
recovery of such parts from an inner bottom of the turbine is extremely<br>
expensive, and in many instances requires robots which are not on site and<br>
can cause on-line delay by days.<br>
Presently, all power stations use duct tape to tape all screws<br>
and pins onto the tool housing. As hydraulic devices are, however, subject<br>
to grease and oil, the tape sometimes loosens up and the parts drop anyway.<br>
Some users wire-connect pins to the tool housing, so that the pins do not<br>
drop into the interior of the tubing. However, when the connecting pin comes<br>
off, the link or the motor housing can fall down.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fluid-<br>
operated power tool, which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
In keeping with these objects and with others which will<br>
become apparent hereinafter, the present invention provides a fluid-<br>
operated power tool, comprising drive means including a fluid-operated<br>
cylinder-piston unit; a first housing accommodating said drive means; a<br>
lever-drive mechanism connected with said drive means and powered by<br>
the latter and also engageable with a fastener for bolting applications; a<br>
second housing accommodating said lever-drive mechanism, said housings<br>
being interconnected so as to turn a fastener when said lever-drive<br>
mechanism is connected to said fastener and powered by said drive<br>
means; and connecting means for releasably connecting said housings<br>
with one another so that said housings are connectable with one another and<br>
disconnectable from one another, said connecting means comprising a female<br>
portion provided in one of said housings and a male portion provided in the other<br>
of said housings and engageable with said female portion for operatably<br>
connecting said first housing and said second housing with one another<br><br>
without subsequently requiring additional pins, screws and other means to<br>
provide a connection between the housings.<br>
When the fluid-operated power tool is designed in accordance<br>
with the present invention, then during and after assembly of the housings<br>
with one another, no additional pins, screws, or other means are needed to<br>
form the connection, which could be lost during or after assembly and drop<br>
inside a corresponding equipment.<br>
In accordance with an additional feature of the present<br>
invention the connecting means is formed so that they counteract forces<br>
created by the drive means during operation so as to counteract a tendency<br>
of the first housing accommodating the cylinder-piston unit to move along its<br>
axis away from the second housing and also to counteract a tendency of the<br>
first housing accommodating the cylinder-piston unit to move transversely to'<br>
the axis.<br>
When the fluid-operated tool is designed in accordance with<br>
these features, it solves a very important problem. There are two forces<br>
created by the cylinder-piston unit that push the lever/drive mechanism. The<br>
housing which accommodates the cylinder-piston unit wants to move back<br><br>
away from the housing which accommodates the lever-drive mechanism<br>
along the axis of the cylinder-piston unit. It also wants to move, depending<br>
on an angle between the axis of the cylinder-piston unit and the transverse<br>
lever arm axis, which changes during operation from, for example 110° at the<br>
beginning of the stroke to 75°. Under power, the cylinder-piston unit wants<br>
to twist relative to the housing accommodating the lever-drive mechanism.<br>
This means that not only the cylinder housing has to be stopped to slide<br>
backwards, but also upwards. When the fluid-operated power tool is<br>
designed in accordance with this new inventive feature, it solves this problem<br>
by stopping the housing accommodating the cylinder-piston unit from sliding<br>
backwards and upwards.<br>
The novel features which are considered as characteristic for<br>
the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The<br>
invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of<br>
operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be<br>
best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when<br>
read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A fluid-operated power tool in accordance with the present<br>
invention has a first housing which is identified with reference numeral 1 and<br>
accommodates a drive means formed, for example, as a fluid-operated<br>
cylinder-piston unit. The fluid-operated cylinder-piston unit includes a<br>
cylinder 2 and a piston 3 provided with a piston rod 4 and displaceable in the<br>
cylinder 2.<br>
The fluid-operated power tool further has a second housing<br>
which is identified with reference numeral 5 and accommodates a lever-drive<br>
mechanism. The lever-drive mechanism includes a lever 6 displaceable by<br>
the piston rod 4 and carrying a pawl 7 which engaging with teeth of a ratchet<br>
8 arranged turnably in the lever 6. The lever 6 is movable between side<br>
plates 9, which together with a spacer 10 form the housing 5.<br>
The above described construction of the fluid-operated power<br>
tool is known in the art and operates as follows:<br>
During an advance stroke of the fluid-operated power tool, a<br>
power fluid is supplied into the cylinder 2, for example to the right side of the<br><br>
piston 3, and displaces the piston 3 with the piston rod 4 to the left, the lever<br>
6 is turned by the piston rod and the pawl 7 turns the ratchet 8, so that a<br>
corresponding element, for example a socket, a projection, etc. cooperating<br>
with the ratchet engages a fastener and turns the fastener. During a return<br>
stroke the power fluid is withdrawn from the cylinder at the right side of the<br>
piston 3 or introduced into the cylinder at the left side of the piston 3, and the<br>
piston 3 together with the piston rod 4 is displaced in an opposite direction,<br>
so that the lever 6 is turned in an opposite direction and the pawl 7 is<br>
disengaged from the teeth of the ratchet. With a plurality of advance and<br>
return strokes, the fastener is tightened or loosened correspondingly.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the fluid-operated<br>
power tool is provided with connecting means which connects the housings<br>
1 and 5 with one another, so that during an assembly of the housings 1 and<br>
5 with one another, or after the assembly, no additional pins, screws or other'<br>
parts have to be inserted into the housings to form the connection.<br>
In the shown embodiment of the invention, the connecting<br>
means include two connection units which are preferably spaced from one<br>
another in a substantially vertical direction and in a substantially horizontal<br>
direction, on the view of Figure 1. In other words they are spaced from one<br><br>
another preferably in the direction of an axis A1 of the cylinder-piston unit<br>
and also in the direction which is transverse to the axis.<br>
The first connection unit of the connecting means includes a<br>
pin 13 which extends through throughgoing openings 14 in side portions 15<br>
of the housing 1 and is fixed in the openings 14 by retaining rings 16. The<br>
first connection unit further includes upwardly open slots 17 provided in side<br>
plates 9 of the housing 5, into which the pin 13 is insertable. The slots 17 of<br>
the side plates 9 of the housing 5 form a female formation, while the pins 13<br>
fixed in the side portions 15 of the housing 1 form a male formation which is<br>
insertable in the female formation.<br>
The second connection unit of the connecting means includes<br>
a downwardly extending loop-shaped projection 18 provided in the cylinder<br>
2 and holding a pin 19, and also slots 20 provided in the side plates 9 of the<br>
housing 5. The slots 20 in the side plates 9 of the housing 5 form a female<br>
formation, while the pin 19 in the cylinder 2 of the housing 1 forms a male<br>
formation which is insertable in the female formation.<br>
As can be seen from the drawings, the two connection units are<br>
spaced from one another in two transverse directions, for example in the<br><br>
direction of the axis A1 and in the direction which is transverse to the axis<br>
A1. The same is true for the male and female formations. The male<br>
formations 13 and 19 are spaced from one another in two mutually<br>
transverse directions, and the female formations 17 and 20 are also spaced<br>
from one another in two mutually transverse directions.<br>
In order to assemble the housings 1 and 5 with one another,<br>
the housing 5 is moved toward the housing 1, so that the pin 13 is inserted<br>
into the slots 17 and the pin 19 is inserted into the slots 20.<br>
A locking mechanism is provided for locking the housings 1 and<br>
5 with one another in the assembled condition. The locking mechanism<br>
includes a lever 21 which is turnable about an axis 22. The lever 21 has one<br>
arm 23 having for example a cam-shaped end, and another arm 24, so that<br>
the arms are located at opposite sides of the axis 22. A spring 25 pulls the<br>
arm 24 of the lever 21 upwardly in Figure 1, so that the cam-shaped end of<br>
the arm 23 abuts against the pin 13 and prevents disengagement of the pin<br>
13 from the slots 17.<br>
In order to release the housings 1 and 5 from one another, a<br>
user depresses the arm 23 of the lever 21 downwardly so that its cam-<br><br>
shaped end no longer acts on the pin 13, thus allowing the pin 13 to move<br>
upwardly in the slots 17, so that the housing 1 can be displaced upwardly<br>
and the pins 13 and 19 can be disengaged from the slots 17 and 20 of the<br>
housing 5.<br>
The fluid-operated power tool in accordance with the present<br>
invention is designed so that the tendency of the housing 1 during operation<br>
to move axially in direction of the axis A1 from the housing 5 and to move<br>
transversely to the axis A1 is counteracted. In particular, as shown in Figure<br>
3, each of the slots 17 and 20 is formed so that it has one part extending in<br>
one direction, in particular in a vertical direction in Figure 3 as identified with<br>
reference numerals 17' and 20', and another part which is offset in direction<br>
of the axis A1 from the first mentioned part 17' and 20' as identified with<br>
reference numerals 17" and 20". The slots 17 and 20 can have substantially<br>
the shape of letter J.<br>
During the operation of the fluid-operated power tool the<br>
housing 1 can not move relative to the housing 5 in the axial direction of the<br>
axis A1 away from the housing 5 because the pins 13 and 19 abut against<br>
a side surface 26 of the slots 17 and 20. At the same time, the housing 1<br>
can not move relative to the housing 5 transversely to the axis A1 upwardly,<br><br>
because the pins 13 and 19 abut against an upper surface 27 of the parts<br>
17" and 20" of the slots 17 and 20.<br>
It will be understood that each of the elements described<br>
above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other<br>
types of constructions differing from the types described above.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described as<br>
embodied in fluid-operated power tool, it is not intended to be limited to the<br>
details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be<br>
made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the<br>
gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge,<br>
readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from'<br>
the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the<br>
generic or specific aspects of this invention.<br>
