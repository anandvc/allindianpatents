Z is a divalent moiety bound to both A' and M via a-bonds, said Z comprising boron, or a member of Group 14 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, and also comprising nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur or oxygen;<br>
X is an anionic or dianionic ligand group having up to 60 atoms exclusive of the class of ligands that are cyclic, delocalized, n-bound ligand groups;<br>
X' independently each occurrence is a neutral Lewis base ligating compound, having up to 20 atoms;<br>
p is 0,1 or 2, and is two less than the formal oxidation state of M, with the proviso that when X is a dianionic ligand group, p is 1; and<br>
q is 0,1 or 2.<br>
The above complexes may exist as isolated crystals optionally in pure form or as a mixture with other complexes, in the form of a solvated adduct, optionally in a solvent, especially an organic liquid, as well as in the form of a dimer or chelated derivative thereof, wherein the<br><br>
chelating agent is an organic material, preferably a neutral Lewis base, especially a trihydrocarbylamine, trihydrocarbylphosphine, or halogenated derivative thereof.<br>
Further according to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing polymers of olefin monomers comprising contacting one or more such monomers with a catalyst comprising:<br>
1)	a metal complex corresponding to the formula Z A' M XpXq,<br>
wherein:<br>
M is titanium, zirconium or hafnium in the +2, +3 or +4 formal oxidation state;<br>
A' is a substituted indenyl group substituted in at least the 2 or 3 position with a group selected from hydrocarbyl, fluoro-substituted hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxy-substituted hydrocarbyl, dialkylamino- substituted hydrocarbyl, silyl, germyl and mixtures thereof, said group containing up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms, and said A' further being covalently bonded to M by means of a divalent Z group;<br>
Z is a divalent moiety bound to both A' and M via a-bonds, said z comprising boron, or a member of Group 14 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, and also comprising nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur or oxygen;<br>

X' independently each occurrence is a neutral Lewis base ligating compound, having up to 20 atoms;<br>
p is 0,1 or 2, and is two less than the formal oxidation state of M, with the proviso that when X is a dianionic ligand group, p is 1; and<br>
q is 0,1 or 2;<br>
and<br>
2)	an activating cocatalyst<br>
the molar ratio of 1) to 2) being from 1:10,000 to 100:1, or<br>
the reaction product formed by converting 1) to an active catalyst by use of an activating technique.<br>
The present catalysts and process result in the highly efficient production of high molecular weight olefin polymers over a wide range of polymerization conditions, and especially at elevated temperatures. They are especially useful for the solution polymerization of ethylene/propylene (EP polymers) and ethylene/propylene/diene (EPDM polymers) wherein the<br><br>
diene is ethyiidenenorbornene, 1,4-hexadiene or similar nonconjugated diene. The use of elevated temperatures dramatically increases the productivity of such process due to the fact that increased polymer solubility at elevated temperatures allows the use of increased conversions (higher concentration of polymer product) without exceeding solution viscosity limitations of the polymerization equipment as well as reduced energy costs needed to devolatilize the reaction product.<br>

The complexes can be prepared by use of well known synthetic techniques. Optionally a reducing agent can be employed to produce the lower oxidation state complexes. Such a process is disclosed in USSN 8/241,523, filed May 13, 1994, published as WO95-00526. The reactions are conducted in a suitable noninterfering solvent at a temperature from -100 to 300 °C, preferably from -78 to 100 °C, most preferably from 0 to 50 °C. By the term "reducing agent" herein is meant a metal or compound which, under reducing conditions causes the metal M, to be reduced from a higher to a lower oxidation state. Examples of suitable metal reducing agents are alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, aluminum and zinc, alloys of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as sodium/mercury amalgam and sodium/potassium alloy. Examples of suitable reducing agent compounds are sodium naphthaienide, potassium graphite, lithium alkyls, lithium or potassium alkadienyls; and Grignard reagents. Most preferred reducing agents are the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, especially lithium and magnesium metal.<br>
Suitable reaction media for the formation of the complexes include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and cyclic ethers, particularly branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; aromatic and hydrocarbyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, C1.4 dialkyi ethers, C1.4 dialkyi ether derivatives of (poly)alkylene glycols, and tetrahydrofuran. Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br>
The complexes are rendered catalytically active by combination with an activating cocatalyst or by use of an activating technique. Suitable activating cocatalysts for use herein include polymeric or oligomeric alumoxanes, especially methylalumoxane, triisobutyl aluminum modified methylalumoxane, or isobutylalumoxane; neutral Lewis acids, such as C1.30 hydrocarbyl substituted Group 13 compounds, especially tri{hydrocarbyl)aluminum- or tri(hydrocarbyl)boron compounds and halogenated (including perhalogenated) derivatives thereof, having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or halogenated hydrocarbyl group, more especially perfluorinated tri(aryl)boron compounds, and most especially tris(pentafluoro-phenyl)borane; nonpolymeric, compatible, noncoordinating, ion forming compounds (including the use of such compounds under oxidizing conditions), especially the use of ammonium-, phosphonium-, oxonium-, carbonium-, silylium- or sulfonium- salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions, or ferrocenium salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions; bulk electrolysis (explained in more detail hereinafter); and combinations of the foregoing activating cocatalysts and techniques. The foregoing activating cocatalysts and activating techniques have been previously taught with respect to different metal complexes in the following<br><br><br>
references: EP-A-277,003, US-A-5,153,157, US-A-5,064,802, EP-A-468,651 (equivalent to U. S. Serial No. 07/547,718), EP-A-520,732 (equivalent to U. S. Serial No. 07/876,268), and EP-A-520,732 (equivalent to U. S. Serial Nos. 07/884,966 filed May 1, 1992).<br>
Combinations of neutral Lewis acids, especially the combination of a trialkyl aluminum compound having from 1 to 4 carbons in each alkyl group and a halogenated tri(hydrocarbyl)boron compound having from 1 to 20 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, especially tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, further combinations of such neutral Lewis acid mixtures with a polymeric or oligomeric alumoxane, and combinations of a single neutral Lewis acid, especially tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with a polymeric or oligomeric alumoxane are especially desirable activating cocatalysts. A benefit according to the present invention is the discovery that the most efficient catalyst activation using such a combination of tris(pentafluoro-phenyl)borane/alumoxane mixture occurs at reduced levels of alumoxane. Preferred molar ratios of Group 4 metal complex:tris(pentafluoro-phenylborane:alumoxane are from 1:1:1 to 1:5:5, more preferably from 1:1:1.5 to 1:5:3. The surprising efficient use of lower levels of alumoxane with the present invention allows for the production of olefin polymers with high catalytic efficiencies using less of the expensive alumoxane cocatalyst. Additionally, polymers with lower levels of aluminum residue, and hence greater clarity, are obtained.<br>
Suitable ion forming compounds useful as cocatalysts in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible, noncoordinating anion. A'. As used herein, the term "noncoordinating" means an anion or substance which either does not coordinate to the Group 4 metal containing precursor complex and the catalytic derivative derived therefrom, or which is only weakly coordinated to such complexes thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. A noncoordinating anion specifically refers to an anion which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in a cationic metal complex does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment thereof to said cation thereby forming neutral complexes. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
Preferred anions are those containing a single coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, and silicon. Compounds containing anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal or metalloid atom are, of<br><br>
course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially.<br>

Examples of suitable hydrocarbyloxide Q groups are disclosed in U. S. Patent 5,296,433.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, d is one, that is, the counter ion has a single negative charge and is A'. Activating cocatalysts comprising boron which are particularly useful in the preparation of catalysts of this invention may be represented by the following general formula: (L*-H)"(BQ4)-;<br>

Preferred silylium salt activating cocatalysts are trimethylsilylium tetrakispentafluorophenylborate, triethylsilylium tetrakispentafluorophenylborate and ether substituted adducts thereof. Silylium salts have been previously generically disclosed in J. Chem Soc. Chem. Comm., 1993, 383-384, as well as Lambert, J. B., et a!., Organometallics, 1994,13, 2430-2443. The use of the above silylium salts as activating cocatalysts for addition polymerization catalysts is claimed in United States Patent Application entitled, Silylium Cationic Polymerization Activators For Metallocene Complexes, filed in the names of David Neithamer, David Devore, Robert LaPointe and Robert Mussell on September 12,1994.<br>
Certain complexes of alcohols, mercaptans, silanols, and oximes with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane are also effective catalyst activators and may be used according to the present invention. Such cocatalysts are disclosed in USP 5,296,433.<br>
The technique of bulk electrolysis involves the electrochemical oxidation of the metal complex under electrolysis conditions in the presence of a supporting electrolyte comprising a noncoordinating, inert anion. In the technique, solvents, supporting electrolytes and electrolytic potentials for the electrolysis are used such that electrolysis byproducts that would render the metal complex catalytically inactive are not substantially formed during the reaction. More particularly, suitable solvents are materials that are: liquids under the conditions of the electrolysis (generally temperatures from 0 to 100 °C), capable of dissolving the supporting electrolyte, and inert. "Inert solvents" are those that are not reduced or oxidized under the reaction conditions employed for the electrolysis. It is generally possible in view of the desired electrolysis reaction to choose a solvent and a supporting electrolyte that are unaffected by the electrical potential used for the desired electrolysis. Preferred solvents include difluorobenzene (all isomers), dimethoxyethane (DME), and mixtures thereof.<br>
The electrolysis may be conducted in a standard electrolytic cell containing an anode and cathode (also referred to as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively). Suitable materials of construction for the cell are glass, plastic, ceramic and glass coated metal. The electrodes are prepared from inert conductive materials, by which are meant conductive<br><br>
materials that are unaffected by the reaction mixture or reaction conditions. Platinum or palladium are preferred inert conductive materials. Normally an ion permeable membrane such as a fine glass frit separates the cell into separate compartments, the working electrode compartment and counter electrode compartment. The working electrode is immersed in a reaction medium comprising the metal complex to be activated, solvent, supporting electrolyte, and any other materials desired for moderating the electrolysis or stabilizing the resulting complex. The counter electrode is immersed in a mixture of the solvent and supporting electrolyte. The desired voltage may be determined by theoretical calculations or experimentally by sweeping the cell using a reference electrode such as a silver electrode immersed in the cell electrolyte. The background cell current, the current draw in the absence of the desired electrolysis, is also determined. The electrolysis is completed when the current drops from the desired level to the background level. In this manner, complete conversion of the initial metal complex can be easily detected.<br>
Suitable supporting electrolytes are salts comprising a cation and a compatible, noncoordinating anion, A-. Preferred supporting electrolytes are salts corresponding to the formula G'*"A'; wherein:<br>
G* is a cation which is nonreactive towards the starting and resulting complex, and<br>
A' is as previously defined.<br>
Examples of cations, G*, include tetrahydrocarbyl substituted ammonium or phosphonium cations having up to 40 nonhydrogen atoms. Preferred cations are the tetra(n-butylammonium)- and tetraethylammonium- cations.<br>
During activation of the complexes of the present invention by bulk electrolysis the cation of the supporting electrolyte passes to the counter electrode and A- migrates to the working electrode to become the anion of the resulting oxidized product. Either the solvent or the cation of the supporting electrolyte is reduced at the counter electrode in equal molar quantity with the amount of oxidized metal complex formed at the working electrode. Preferred supporting electrolytes are tetrahydrocarbylammonium salts of tetrakis(perfluoroaryl) borates having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or perfluoroaryl group, especially tetra(n-butylammonium)tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate.<br>
A further recently discovered electrochemical technique for generation of activating cocatalysts is the electrolysis of a disilane compound in the presence of a source of a noncoordinating compatible anion. This technique is more fully disclosed and claimed in the previously mentioned United States Patent application entitled, "Silylium Cationic Polymerization Activators For Metallocene Complexes", filed on September 12,1994.<br><br>
The foregoing electrochemical activating technique and activating cocatalysts may also be used in combination. An especially preferred combination is a mixture of a tri(hydrocarbyl)aluminum or tri(hydrocarbyl)borane compound having from 1 to 4 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group with an oligomeric or polymeric alumoxane compound.<br>
The molar ratio of catalyst/cocatalyst employed preferably ranges from 1:10,000 to 100:1, more preferably from 1:5000 to 10:1, most preferably from 1:1000 to 1:1. Alumoxane, when used by itself as an activating cocatalyst, is employed in large quantity, generally at least 100 times the quantity of metal complex on a molar basis. Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, where used as an activating cocatalyst is employed in a molar ratio to the metal complex of form 0.5:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 6:1 most preferably from 1:1 to 5:1. The remaining activating cocatalysts are generally employed in approximately equimolar quantity with the metal complex.<br>
The process may be used to polymerize ethylenically unsaturated monomers having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms either alone or in combination. Preferred monomers include monovinylidene aromatic monomers, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinylcyclohexane, norbornadiene and C3.10 aliphatic a-olefins (especially ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-octene), C4.40 dienes, and mixtures thereof. Most preferred monomers are ethylene, and mixtures of ethylene, propylene and a nonconjugated diene, especially ethylidenenorbornene.<br>
In general, the polymerization may be accomplished at conditions well known in the prior art for Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn type polymerization reactions, that is, temperatures from 0-250 °C, preferably 30 to 200 °C and pressures from atmospheric to 10,000 atmospheres. Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase, solid state powder polymerization or other process condition may be employed if desired. A support, especially silica, alumina, or a polymer (especially poly(tetrafluoroethylene) or a polyolefin) may be employed, and desirably is employed when the catalysts are used in a gas phase polymerization process. The support is preferably employed in an amount to provide a weight ratio of catalyst (based on metal) :support from 1:100,000 to 1:10, more preferably from 1:50,000 to 1:20, and most preferably from 1:10,000 to 1:30.<br>
In most polymerization reactions the molar ratio of catalyst:polymerizable compounds employed is from 10":1 to 10\-1, more preferably from 10-1 to 10':1.<br>
Suitable solvents for polymerization are inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and mixtures thereof; cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof; perfluorinated hydrocarbons<br><br>
such as perfluorinated C4.10 alkanes, and the like and aromatic and alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene and the like. Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers including ethylene, propylene, butadiene, cyclopentene, 1-hexene, 1-hexane, 4-vinylcyclohexene, vinylcyclohexane, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1-octene, 1-decene, styrene, divinylbenzene, allylbenzene, vinyltoluene (including all isomers alone or in admixture), and the like. Mixtures of the foregoing are also suitable.<br>
The catalysts may be utilized in combination with at least one additional homogeneous or heterogeneous polymerization catalyst in separate reactors connected in series or in parallel to prepare polymer blends having desirable properties. An example of such a process is disclosed in WO 94/00500, equivalent to U. S. Serial Number 07/904,770, as well as U. S. Serial Number 08/10958, filed January 29,1993.<br>
Utilizing the catalysts of the present invention copolymers having high comonomer incorporation and correspondingly low density, yet having a low melt index may be readily prepared. That is, high molecular weight polymers are readily attained by use of the present catalysts even at elevated reactor temperatures. This result is highly desirable because the molecular weight of a-olefin copolymers can be readily reduced by the use of hydrogen or similar chain transfer agent, however increasing the molecular weight of a-olefin copolymers is usually only attainable by reducing the polymerization temperature of the reactor. Disadvantageously, operation of a polymerization reactor at reduced temperatures significantly increases the cost of operation since heat must be removed from the reactor to maintain the reduced reaction temperature, while at the same time heat must be added to the reactor effluent to vaporize the solvent. In addition, productivity is increased due to improved polymer solubility, decreased solution viscosity, and a higher polymer concentration. Utilizing the present catalysts, a-olefin homopolymers and copolymers having densities from 0.85 g/cm to 0.96 g/cm, and melt flow rates from 0.001 to 10.0 dg/min are readily attained in a high temperature process.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention are particularly advantageous for the production of ethylene homopolymers and ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having high levels of long chain branching. The use of the catalysts of the present invention in continuous polymerization processes, especially continuous, solution polymerization processes, allows for elevated reactor temperatures which favor the formation of vinyl terminated polymer chains that may be incorporated into a growing polymer, thereby giving a long chain branch. The use of the present catalysts system advantageously allows for the economical production of ethylene/a-olefin copolymers having processability similar to high pressure, free radical produced low density polyethylene.<br><br>
The present catalysts system may be advantageously employed to prepare olefin polymers having improved processing properties by polymerizing ethylene alone or ethylene/a-olefin mixtures with low levels of a "H" branch inducing diene, such as norbornadiene, 1,7-octadiene, or 1,9-decadiene. The unique combination of elevated reactor temperatures, high molecular weight (or low melt indices) at high reactor temperatures and high comonomer reactivity advantageously allows for the economical production of polymers having excellent physical properties and processability. Preferably such polymers comprise ethylene, a C3-20 a-olefin and a "H"-branching comonomer. Preferably, such polymers are produced in a solution process, most preferably a continuous solution process.<br>
As previously mentioned, the present catalyst system is particularly useful in the preparation of EP and EPDM copolymers in high yleld and productivity. The process employed may be either a solution or slurry process both of which are previously known in the art. Kaminsky, J. Poly. Sci.. Vol. 23, pp. 2151-64 (1985) reported the use of a soluble bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dimethyl-alumoxane catalyst system for solution polymerization of EP and EPDM elastomers. USP 5,229,478 disclosed a slurry polymerization process utilizing similar bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium based catalyst systems.<br>
In general terms, it is desirable to produce such EP and EPDM elastomers under conditions of increased reactivity of the diene monomer component. The reason for this was explained in the above identified '478 patent in the following manner, which still remains true despite the advances attained in such reference. A major factor affecting production costs and hence the utility of an EPDM is the diene monomer cost. The diene is a more expensive monomer material than ethylene or propylene. Further, the reactivity of diene monomers with previously known metallocene catalysts is lower than that of ethylene and propylene. Consequently, to achieve the requisite degree of diene incorporation to produce an EPDM with an acceptably fast cure rate, it has been necessary to use a diene monomer concentration which, expressed as a percentage of the total concentration of monomers present, is in substantial excess compared to the percentage of diene desired to be incorporated into the final EPDM product. Since substantial amounts of unreacted diene monomer must be recovered from the polymerization reactor effluent for recycle the cost of production is increased unnecessarily.<br>
Further adding to the cost of producing an EPDM is the fact that, generally, the exposure of an olefin polymerization catalyst to a diene, especially the high concentrations of diene monomer required to produce the requisite level of diene incorporation in the final EPDM product, often reduces the rate or activity at which the catalyst will cause polymerization of ethylene and propylene monomers to proceed. Correspondingly, lower throughputs and longer<br><br>
reaction times have been required, compared to the production of an ethylene-propylene co|Dolymer elastomer or other a-olefin copolymer elastomer.<br>
The present catalyst system advantageously allows for increased diene reactivity thereby preparing EPDM polymers in high yleld and productivity. Additionally, the catalyst system of the present invention achieves the economical production of EPDM polymers with diene contents of up to 20 weight percent or higher, which polymers possess highly desirable fast cure rates.<br>
The non-conjugated diene monomer can be a straight chain, branched chain or cyclic hydrocarbon diene having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable non-conjugated dienes are straight chain acyclic dienes such as 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene: branched chain acyclic dienes such as 5-methyl-1,4-hexadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadiene; 3,7-dimethyl-1,7-octadiene and mixed isomers of dihydromyricene and dihydroocinene: single ring alicyclic dienes such as 1,3-cyclopentadiene; 1,4-cyclohexadiene; 1,5-cyclooctadiene and 1,5-cyclododecadiene: and multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes such as tetrahydroindene, methyl tetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene; bicyclo-(2,2,1)-hepta-2, 5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB); 5-propenyl-2-norbornene,5-isopropylidene-2-norbornene,5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbornene,5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbornene, 5-vinyl-2-norbornene and norbornadiene.<br>
Of the dienes typically used to prepare EPDMs, the particularly preferred dienes are 1,4-hexadiene (HD), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-vinylidene-2-norbornene (VNB), 5-methylene-2-norbornene (MNB), and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). The especially preferred dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) and 1,4-hexadiene (HD).<br>
The preferred EPDM elastomers may contain 20 up to 90 weight percent ethylene, more preferably 30 to 85 weight percent ethylene, most preferably 35 to 80 weight percent ethylene.<br>
The alpha-olefins suitable for use in the preparation of elastomers with ethylene and dienes are preferably C3.16 alpha-olefins. Illustrative non-limiting examples of such alpha-olefins are propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, and 1-dodecene. The alpha-olefin is generally incorporated into the EPDM polymer at 10 to 80 weight percent, more preferably at 20 to 65 weight percent. The non-conjugated dienes are generally incorporated into the EPDM at 0.5 to 20 weight percent; more, preferably at 1 to 15 weight percent, and most preferably at 3 to 12 weight percent. If desired, more than one diene may be incorporated simultaneously, for example HD and ENB, with total diene incorporation within the limits specified above.<br><br>
The catalyst system may be prepared as a homogeneous catalyst by addition of the requisite components to a solvent in which polymerization will be carried out by solution polymerization procedures. The catalyst system may also be prepared and employed as a heterogeneous catalyst by adsorbing the requisite components on a catalyst support material such as silica gel, alumina or other suitable inorganic support material. When prepared in heterogeneous or supported form, it is preferred to use silica as the support material. The heterogeneous form of the catalyst system is employed in a slurry polymerization. As a practical limitation, slurry polymerization takes place in liquid diluents in which the polymer product is substantially insoluble. Preferably, the diluent for slurry polymerization is one or more hydrocarbons with less than 5 carbon atoms. If desired, saturated hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane or butane may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Likewise the a-olefin monomer or a mixture of different a-olefin monomers may be used in whole or part as the diluent. Most preferably the diluent comprises in at least major part the a-olefin monomer or monomers to be polymerized.<br>
In contrast, solution polymerization conditions utilize a solvent for the respective components of the reaction, particularly the EP or EPDM polymer. Preferred solvents include mineral oils and the various hydrocarbons which are liquid at reaction temperatures. Illustrative examples of useful solvents include alkanes such as pentane, iso-pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and nonane, as well as mixtures of alkanes including kerosene and Isopar E", available from Exxon Chemicals Inc.; cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane; and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene and diethylbenzene.<br>
At all times, the individual ingredients as well as the recovered catalyst components must be protected from oxygen and moisture. Therefore, the catalyst components and catalysts must be prepared and recovered in an oxygen and moisture free atmosphere. Preferably, therefore, the reactions are performed in the presence of an dry, inert gas such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
Ethylene is added to the reaction vessel in an amount to maintain a differential pressure in excess of the combined vapor pressure of the a-olefin and diene monomers. The ethylene content of the polymer is determined by the ratio of ethylene differential pressure to the total reactor pressure. Generally the polymerization process is carried out with a differential pressure of ethylene of from 10 to 1000 psi (70 to 7000 kPa), most preferably from 40 to 400 psi (30 to 300 kPa). The polymerization is generally conducted at a temperature of from 25 to 200 °C, preferably from 75 to 170 °C, and most preferably from greater than 95 to 140 °C.<br>
The polymerization may be carried out as a batchwise or a continuous polymerization process A continuous process is preferred, in which event catalyst, ethylene, a-olefin, and<br><br>
optionally solvent and diene are continuously supplied to the reaction zone and polymer product continuously removed therefrom.<br>
Without limiting in any way the scope of the invention, one means for carrylng out such a polymerization process is as follows: In a stirred-tank reactor propylene monomer is introduced continuously together with solvent, diene monomer and ethylene monomer. The reactor contains a liquid phase composed substantially of ethylene, propylene and diene monomers together with any solvent or additional diluent. If desired, a small amount of a "H"-branch inducing diene such as norbornadiene, 1,7-octadiene or 1,9=-decadiene may also be added. Catalyst and cocatalyst are continuously introduced in the reactor liquid phase. The reactor temperature and pressure may be controlled by adjusting the solvent/monomer ratio, the catalyst addition rate, as well as by cooling or heating coils, jackets or both. The polymerization rate is controlled by the rate of catalyst addition. The ethylene content of the polymer product is determined by the ratio of ethylene to propylene in the reactor, which is controlled by manipulating the respective feed rates of these components to the reactor. The polymer product molecular weight is controlled, optionally, by controlling other polymerization variables such as the temperature, monomer concentration, or by a stream of hydrogen introduced to the reactor, as is well known in the art. The reactor effluent is contacted with a catalyst kill agent such as water. The polymer solution is optionally heated, and the polymer product is recovered by flashing off gaseous ethylene and propylene as well as residual solvent or diluent at reduced pressure, and, if necessary, conducting further devolatiiization in equipment such as a devolatilizing extruder. In a continuous process the mean residence time of the catalyst and polymer in the reactor generally is from 5 minutes to 8 hours, and preferably from 10 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
In a preferred manner of operation, the polymerization is conducted in a continuous solution polymerization system comprising two reactors connected in series or parallel. In one reactor a relatively high molecular weight product (Mw from 300,000 to 600,000, more preferably 400,000 to 500,000) is formed while in the second reactor a product of a relatively low molecular weight (Iw 50,000 to 300,000) is formed. The final product is a blend of the two reactor effluents which are combined prior to devolatiiization to result in a uniform blend of the two polymer products. Such a dual reactor process allows for the preparation of products having improved properties. In a preferred embodiment the reactors are connected in series, that is effluent from the first reactor is charged to the second reactor and fresh monomer, solvent and hydrogen is added to the second reactor. Reactor conditions are adjusted such that the weight ratio of polymer produced in the first reactor to that produced in the second reactor is from 20:80 to 80:20. In addition the temperature of the second reactor is controlled to produce the lower molecular weight product. This system beneficially allow for production of<br><br>
EPDI\/1 products having a large range of Mooney viscosities, as well as excellent strength and processabiiity. Preferably the Mooney viscosity (ASTM D1646-94, ML1+4 @125 °C) of the resulting product is adjusted to fall in the range from 1 to 200, preferably from 5 to 150m and most preferably from 10 to 110.<br>

Polymerizations<br>
A two-liter Parr reactor was charged with 740 g of Isopar-E™ mixed alkanes solvent (available from Exxon Chemicals Inc.) and 118 g of 1-octene comonomer. Hydrogen was added as a molecular weight control agent by differential pressure expansion from a 75 mL addition tank at 25 psi (2070 kPa). The reactor was heated to the polymerization temperature of 140 C and saturated with ethylene at 500 psig (3.4 MPa). 2.0 imol each of catalyst and cocatalyst at 0.005 M solutions in toluene were premixed in the drybox. After the desired premix time, the solution was transferred to a catalyst addition tank and injected into the reactor. The polymerization conditions were maintained for 15 minutes with ethylene on demand. The resulting solution was removed from the reactor, and a hindered phenol antioxidant (Irganox™ 1010 from Ciba Geigy Corporation) was added to the resulting solution. Polymers formed were dried in a vacuum oven set at 120 -C for 20 hours. Results are contained in Table 1.<br><br>

Efficiencies in runs 1-8 of the above polymerizations averaged approximately 80 percent of those attained in comparative run 9. The results of the above polymerizations indicate that significantly higher molecular weight polymers are formed by the use of the present, substituted indenyl containing metal complexes compared to previously known constrained geometry or amidosilane bridged monocyclopentadienyl based metal complexes at the same reaction conditions. Such a result is highly desirable, particularly in a solution polymerization reaction, due to the fact that the operator is now able to obtain a given molecular weight polymer at a higher reaction temperature, thereby increasing productivity and reducing processing costs. Moreover, previously unattainable, low melt index, high comonomer content, high molecular weight, ethylene/a-olefin copolymers, especially EP and EPDM copolymers can be readily produced using such catalyst systems.<br><br>
