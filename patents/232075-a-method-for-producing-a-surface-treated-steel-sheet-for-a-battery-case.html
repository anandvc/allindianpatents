				<td>A surface treated steel sheet for battery container, a battery container and a battery using thereof<br>
(Field of the invention)<br>
The present invention concerns a surface treated steel sheet for<br>
battery container, a battery container and a battery using thereof.<br>
(Prior art)<br>
•v<br>
A method of post-plating, that is barrel plating, after press forming cold-rolled steel strip into a battery container or a method of pre-plating, that is press forming nickel-plated steel strip into a battery container, have been adopted for manufacturing a battery container for primary battery such as alkali-manganesie batteries and secondary battery such as nickel cadmium batteries and nickel-hydrogen battery of which extending demand is expected in which strong alkaline solution is packed. Prom these points of view, the inventors of the present application previously proposed a surface treated steel sheet excellent for a battery container having small<br>
internal resistance (WO 95/1152?) .<br><br><br>
Recently, DI (drawing and ironing) forming method is increasingly used as a method of thinning wall to increase the capacity cf the battery replacing the past multi step deep drawing method (see Published Japanese Patent Hel 7-99686) . This DI forming method and DTK (drawing thin and redraw) forming method is capable of increasing the battery capac-<br><br>
tive materials to be contained. Moreover, the thick bottom has an advantage to improve the pressure resistance of the battery. (Objective of the present invention )<br>
By the way, although the DI forming method and the DTR forming method are effective for increasing battery capacity as mentioned above, there is a disadvantage when they are used for continuous forming because the deformation resistance of the material in those methods is greater than in the conventional multi step deep-drawing forming method. Concretely, when the powdering quality (powdery dropout of the plating layer) in the cupping process of the DI forming method and the DTR forming method is inferior, the powder adheres to the die and the punch in the ironing process causing a defect in the container side wall. Although the similar phenomenon happens in the deep-drawing forming, the above-mentioned defect is more remarkable in the DI form-Ing method and the DTR forming method because the container wall has small surface roughness, which produced more lustrous appearance. Moreover, powdering quality is more critical in the DI forming method and the DTR forming method. Also, because the contact pressure of the material and the tool is greater in the DI forming m«thod and the DTR forming method than that in the drawing method, favoiable lubrication is requested for tool life. Therefore, materials which have a favorable powdering quality and retention of the press lubricant are requested.<br><br>
For the surface to be the outside of a battery container, as-plated steel sheet by the gloss nickel plating has been adopted. However, as it produces a hard and brittle gloss plating layer, it has inferior powdering quality at the press-forming. In addition, since gloss plating involves organic additives containing sulfir (for example, sulfomic acid havlng=C-SO 2 -group) to make electrolytically deposited crystal grains fine, sulfur is absorbed in the plating layer, which causes the em-brittlement with sulfur promoted by the temperature rise Of the material in the ironing and the stretching process of the Dl forming and the DTR forming resulting in a deteriorated powdering quality.<br>
The present Invention is based on such findings and it is aimed at a battery container having a surface treated layer with the small internal resistance at the inner surface of it and high quality and excellent continuous formability at the outer surface of it. And it is further aimed at a surface treated steel sheet which is suitable for producing the said battery container. Another objective of the present invention is to improve the removability of container (strippability) after the DI forming and the DTR forming. This is taken into consideration since the difficulty of stripping the container from the punch (strippability) in the final pressing process is critical in the container manufacturing in addition to the above-mentioned powdering quality. At stripping where the container is pulled out from the punch hitching fingernails or the edge of the container, there was a problem that an inferior stripping caused<br><br>
breaking and split at the open edge portion of the container more frequently, which deteriorated the productivity. (The best manner realizing the present invention )<br>
A surface treated steel sheet of the present invention is explained below.<br>
A surface treated steel sheet of the present invention has the different component of the surface treated layer at the side to be the inner surface of a battery container and that to be the outer surface of it. At first, the composition of the surface treated layer at the<br>
x<br>
surface to be the inner surface of a battery container is explained in detail. A nickel-tin diffusion layer or a iron-nlckal-tin diffusion layer is formed on the surface to be the inner surface. The formation of these diffusion layer on the inner surface of a battery container can reduce the internal resistance and improve the battery performance. The thickness of the above-mentioned nickel-tin diffusion layer or iron-nickel-tin diffusion layer is preferably 0.15 to 3.0 LL m. more preferably 0.2 to 2.0 U, m. When it is less than 0.15 IL m, the internal resistance of a battery can not be reduced. On the other hand, when it is more than 3.0 µm, the improvement of the adhesion to the positive electrode mix is saturated, which is not economical.<br>
In order to form a nickel-tin diffusion layer, nickel tin alloy is plated or nickel is plated and subsequently tin is plated, then followed by heat treatment. In addition, it is favorable to form a nickel layer or a iron-nickel diffusion layer unde:r the nickel-tin diffusion layer in order to improve the corrosion resistance of the<br><br>
Whole surface treated steel sheet. The thickness of these layers are<br>
not particularly defined, but they are preferably 3 µm or less taking<br>
into the economical consideration.<br>
Next, a nickel-cobalt layer is formed on the outermost surface of the<br>
surface treated layer at the side to be the outer surface of a battery<br>
container for the following reason. Namely, it is because that a<br>
nickel-cobalt diffusion layer has superior powdering quality and<br>
formability by DI forming and DTK forming to the usual nickel layer<br>
alone.<br>
Next, the manufacturing process of a surface treated steel sheet of the<br>
present invention is explained referring to Figure 1.<br>
(Steel sheet)<br>
In general, a low carbon aluminum killed steel sheet is favorably used<br>
as a substrate for plating. A non-aging hyper low carbon steel sheet<br>
added by niobium, boron or titanium is also available. A steel strip<br>
electrolytically degreased, annealed and skin-parsed after cold<br>
rolling is usually used as a substrate.<br>
(Nickel plating)<br>
After the pre-treatment consisting of electrolytecal degreasing,<br>
rinsing,  pickling in sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid<br>
( electrolytieal or dipping)  and rinsing is practiced on the<br>
above-mentioned steel substrate, nickel is plated on both sides of the<br>
steel sheet. Since the nickel plating is diffused by the post heat<br>
treatment, the usual problem can be solved. In the present invention.<br>
any of known Watt bath, sulfamic bath or chloride bath is available. In<br><br>
addition, any of non-gloss plating, semi-gloss plating or gloss<br>
plating is available. The sulfur content involved in :he brightener is<br>
rejected during the post heat treatment.<br>
The plating thickness can be different on either side. The thickness of<br>
the nickel plating is 0.5 to 5 Mm, preferably 1 to 4 u m.<br>
When the above-mentioned thickness of the nickel placing is less than<br>
0.5 At m, a lot of pin-holes are formed in the nickel plating layer,<br>
which causes the increasing dissolving of iron (steel) into alkali<br>
v<br>
solution that is packed in the battery container and the formation of iron oxide, that is unfavorable. Furthermore, i: increases the deterioration of the corrosion resistance at the out«r surface of the battery container, that is unfavorable.<br>
Next, the formation of a nickel-cobalt alloy plating in the above-mentioned battery container and the surface treated steel sheet is explained. When cobalt sulfate is added into Watt bath or sulfamic bath, a surface treated layer in which cobalt co-deposiites with nickel is formed.<br>
By the way, the suitable cobalt content of the nickel-cobalt alloy plating is from 0.5% to 10%. When the cobalt content is less than 0.5%, it is not effective for hardening the cobalt plating layer. On the other hand, when the cobalt content is exceeding 10%, it is uneconomical because the hardening effect on the surface treated steel sheet is saturated and also because cobalt is expensive precious metal. (Tin plating) After the afore-mentioned plating, tin is plated on the side of the<br><br>
steel sheet to be the inner surface of a. battery container. The bath<br>
composition can be any of usual acid bath or alkali bath, however,<br>
stannous sulfate bath or phenol-sulfonic acid bath are preferably used<br>
in the present invention.<br>
In this formation of the tinplating layer, tin plating weight is<br>
determined on the following view point. Namely, all the tin plating<br>
layer should be changed into a nickel-tin diffusion :.ayer by the heat<br>
treatment which forms a nickel-tin diffusion layer in the present<br>
invention, since the layer of tin remains, tin dissolves into alkali<br>
solution which i« an electrolyte of an alkali battery, which generates<br>
hydrogen and possibly deteriorates the battery performance.<br>
When heated at 700 C or less in the heat treatment process, nickel-tin<br>
alloy is mainly composed of Ni 3 Sn, Ni 3 Sn 2 and Ni a Sn 1<br>
The above-mentioned method is the first one which forms nickel-tin<br>
diffusion layer comprising forming tin plating layer after forming<br>
nickel plating layer followed by heat treatment.<br>
There is the second method comprising directly plating nickel-tin<br>
alloy plating on the steel sheet followed by heat treatment.<br>
Next, the steel substrate on which nickel-tin alloy plating is formed<br>
is selected from the following two of them.<br>
(D cold rolled steel sheet<br>
(2) steel sheet previously plated with nickel<br>
There are 2 methods in which nickel-tin diffusion layer is formed as<br>
mentioned above. In the present invention, disregarding the adoption<br>
of the first or the second method, the heat treatment should be<br><br>
practiced after plating.<br>
It is because that the formation of the diffusion layer involving<br>
nickel and tin can reduce the internal resistance at the inner surface<br>
of the battery container.<br>
Next, the latter method of nickel-tin alloy plating (the second one in<br>
which the diffusion layer is formed after alloy plating) is explained<br>
in detail.<br>
Chloride-fluoride bath or pyro-phosphate bath are adopted as the<br>
plating bath for nickel-tin alloy plating. The thickness of the<br>
nickel-tin alloy plating is preferably 0.15 to 3,0 µ m.<br>
(Heat treatment)<br>
The post heat treatment is practiced in order to form a diffusion layer.<br>
The heat treatment is preferably practiced under the non oxidizing or<br>
reducing protective gas atmosphere in order to prevent the formation<br>
of the oxide film on the surface. The diffusion layer is formed at<br>
300 C or more. The heating duration is ranged from 30 seconds to 15<br>
hours.<br>
Batch annealing or continuous annealing are available for the heat<br>
treatment of the steel in the present invention. The heating<br>
conditions are preferably 30 seconds to 5 minutes at (500 to 850 * C for<br>
continuous annealing and 5 to 15 hours at 300 to 650  C for batch<br>
annealing. Furthermore, a diffusion layer of iror-niclcel- tin (3<br>
components) can also be formed between the steel substrate and nickel<br>
and tin plating layer in the present invention. In this case, tin<br>
plating layer is formed on the nickel plating layer after nickel<br><br>
plating followed by heating at a higher temperature for a longer duration. In which 3 components diffuse each other. (Skin-pass)<br>
Skin-pass is practiced for the purpose of preventing the stretcher-strain caused by the heat treatment after nickel plating. Another purpose of the practice of skin-pass Is th<a control of the surface roughness or appearance such as bright finish dull finish. it is last finish-rolling they can be controlled></a>
V<br>
selecting the work roil having various surface roughness in the<br>
skin-pass.<br>
(Explanation of a battery container)<br>
Next, the manufacturing of the battery container using the<br>
above-mentioned surface treated steel sheet is explained.<br>
The battery container of the present invention is manufactured<br>
press-forming the surface treated steel sheet manufactured as<br>
mentioned above into cylindrical shape.<br>
The inventors of the present invention founds out that when the<br>
above-mentioned surface treated steel sheet was applied to a battery<br>
container for an alkali battery, the more excellent battery<br>
performance could be obtained rather than that using the usual battery<br>
container.<br>
(Composition of the outer surface of a battery container)<br>
Tn the present invention, a nickel-cobalt diffusion liyer is formed on<br>
the outermost surface of the surface treated layer of l:he outer surface<br>
of a battery container. The formation of the nickel-cobalt diffusion<br><br>
layer on the outermost surface can suppress the powdering when it is press-formed in comparison with the case where the surface treated steel sheet covered with a single layer of niokel plating is press-formed. Furthermore, nickel-cobalt diffusion layer has excellent corrosion resistance.<br>
In addition, a nickel layer is favorably formed under the nickel-cobalt diffusion layer in the present invention. It is favorable to form the nickel layer because it further can improve the corrosion resistance of the nickel-cobalt diffusion layer and also improve the whole outer surface of the battery container. The thickness of the nickel-cobalt diffusion layer formed on the outer surface of the battery container is preferably 0.1 to I u. m, more preferably 0 . 2 to 0.6 li m.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for producing a surface treated steel sheet for a battery case comprising the steps of:<br>
plating the steel sheet with metal , wherein the inner side of the battery case is coated with Ni plating Ni-Sn alloy plating and the outer side of battery case is coated with Ni plating Ni-Co alloy plating,<br>
heating the said plated steel sheet at a temperature of from 300 to 850°C to obtain surface treated steel sheet.<br>

(Manufacturing of battery container)<br>
As for the battery container formed by the DI forming method, the above-mentioned plated steel sheet having the thickness of 0.38 mm was punched out into a blank 41 mm in diameter, drawn into a cup 20. 5 mm in diameter, and then formed into 13.8 mm in outside diameter, 0.20 mm in container wall thickness and 56 mm in height by redrawing and two-step ironing using DI forming machine. Finally, the upper part was trimmed<br><br>
off to shape a LR-6 type battery container 49.3 mm in height. On the other hand, as for the battery container formed by the DTR forming method, the plated steel sheet 0.25 mm in sheet thickness was punched out into a blank 58 mm in diameter, and then shaped into a LR-6 type battery container 13.8 mm in outside diameter, 0.20 mm in container wall thickness and 49.3 mm in height by several times of drawing and redrawing.<br>
(Production of battery)<br>
After manufacturing battery container as described above, LR-6 type alkali-manganese battery was produced as follows.<br>
At first, positive electrode mix was prepared mixing manganese dioxide and graphite at the 10 : 1 by weight ratio and etdding potassium hydroxide (8 mole) to them. After that, the positive electrode mix wag pressed in the did and shaped into a doughnut shaped positive electrode mix pellet having prescribed dimensions, and then it was pressed and fitted into the battery container. Then, the batte:ry container was formed by necked-in forming at just below the open edge portion of it in<br><br>
order to fit a negative electrode board on which a negative electrode collector rod into the battery container.<br>
After that, a separator made of unwoven vinylon cloth was inserted along the inner circuit of the pellet pressed and fitted into the battery container, and then negative electrode gel composed of zinc granules and potassium hydroxide saturated with zinc dioxide was inserted into the battery container. After that, the negative electrode board fitted with an insulating gasket was .inserted into the battery container, and then it was calked around the open edge portion of the battery container.<br>
In case where graphite is coated on the inner surface of the battery container, graphite 80 part (by weight) and thermoset.tlng epoxy resin 20 part (by weight) are mixed and diluted with methyl-ethyl fcetone, and then it is air-sprayed onto the inner surface of the battery container followed by drying at 150 ° C for 15 minutes. (Evaluation of powdering quality)<br>
Furthermore, the powdering quality was evaluated in the 3 forming method, which are drawing. DI forming and DTR forming, in order to evaluate the continuous productivity of the battery ccntainer. The powdering quality was evaluated by the decrease in weight at the following weight measurements of (l) and (2) after forming in the manufacturing process of the above-mentioned battery container. The process was comprising blanking → cupping → degraasing → weight measurement (l) → forming → degreasing → weight measurement (2) . Furthermore, the whole evaluation of powdering quality was evaluated<br><br>
observing the mass of powder fallen off from the plating, that was glued to a cellophane tape after the lubricant on the inner and the outer surfaces of the battery container was rejected by organic solvent, using a microscope of 25 magnification.<br>
Degreasing was conducted by alkali dipping degreasing followed by ultrasonic cleaning in acetone.<br>
Since the error might be large if the weight decrease was measured every one container, 30 of them as one measurement unit  were repeated three times. Table 2 shows the result.<br><br>

As la apparent in Table 2, while in the comparative example of 1 and 2, which were formed using a surface treated steel sheet of which one side to be the outer surface of a battery container was covered with mono layer of nickel plating, a large number of powders fell off from the containers (from 74 to 160 mg/30 containers) , in the examples of the present invention, a small number of powders fell oi:f (from 23 to 33 mg/30 containers) . This shows that the battery container of the present Invention is excellent in powdering quality.<br>
By the way, in the present invention, the powdering quality and the anti-scratch quality can be improved not only using VI forming or DTK forming, which are the methods to reduce the wall thickness of a battery container, but also using the conventional multistage drawing. Therefore, it can preferably be used, also. ( Effect of the invention )<br>
In the battery container as claimed in Claim 1 to 6, the low internal resistance is revealed on the inner surface, and powdering can remarkably be reduced during the forming by DI or DTR, which can suppress the scratch occurrence by metal contact, prolong the life span of the die, and improve the continuous productivity of the battery container.<br>
In the surface treated steel sheet as claimed in Claim 7 to 11, they can be used as the material for the battery container as claimed In Claim 1 to 6.<br>
Moreover, in the battery of the present invention using them, excellent: battery performance such as low internal resistance and<br><br>
large short circuit current can be obtained.<br>
(Brief explanation of figures)<br>
Figure 1 shows the manufacturing process of the surface treated steel<br>
sheet of the present invention.<br>
(Summary)<br>
(Objective)<br>
The present invention aims to produce the material for a battery<br>
container having the improved battery performance^ wherein the<br>
