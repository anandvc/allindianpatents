CATALYSTS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/971,715, filed September 12, 2007.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The field to which the disclosure generally relates includes<br>
catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells that reduce corrosion on<br>
cathode catalyst layers.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	Recently, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells have<br>
generated significant interest for automotive applications. Automotive<br>
competitiveness requires a catalyst-related cell voltage loss less than about<br>
50 mV over the entire current density range over an automotive lifetime<br>
greater than 10 years. This may include about 300,000 large load cycles and<br>
about 30,000 start/stop cycles. Such durability goals have been limited by<br>
cathode electrode degradation, in particular due to carbon corrosion. Factors<br>
that impact carbon corrosion include the many startup/shutdown cycles and<br>
localized H2 starvation. Startup/shutdown associated carbon corrosion may<br>
be due to a local high potential between parts of the cathode and the adjacent<br>
electrolyte while an air/ H2 front is passing through the anode when the<br>
cathode is still filled with air. This local high potential drives rapid carbon<br>
corrosion.<br>
 <br>
[0004]	A hydrogen fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that includes<br>
an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte therebetween. The anode<br>
receives hydrogen-rich gas or pure hydrogen and the cathode receives<br>
oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to generate free<br>
protons and electrons. The protons pass through the electrolyte to the<br>
cathode. The protons react with the oxygen and the electrons in the cathode<br>
to generate water. The electrons from the anode cannot pass through the<br>
electrolyte, and thus are directed through a load to perform work before being<br>
sent to the cathode. The work may be used to operate a vehicle, for example.<br>
[0005]	PEM fuel cells are popular for vehicle applications. The PEM<br>
fuel cell generally includes a solid-polymer-electrolyte proton-conducting<br>
membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane. The anode and<br>
cathode typically include finely divided catalytic particles, usually platinum<br>
(Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an ionomer. The catalytic<br>
mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane. The combination of<br>
the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture, and the membrane<br>
defines a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEAs are relatively<br>
expensive to manufacture and require certain conditions for effective<br>
operation. These conditions include proper water management and<br>
humidification, and control of catalyst poisoning constituents, such as carbon<br>
monoxide (CO).<br>
[0006]	Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack to<br>
generate the desired power. The fuel cell stack includes a series of flow field<br>
or bipolar plates positioned between the several MEAs in the stack. The<br>
bipolar plates include an anode side and a cathode side for adjacent fuel cells<br>
 <br>
in the stack. The fuel cell stack receives an anode hydrogen reactant gas that<br>
flows into the anode side of the stack. Anode gas flow channels are provided<br>
on the anode side of the bipolar plates that allow the anode gas to flow to the<br>
anode side of the MEA. The fuel cell stack receives a cathode reactant gas,<br>
typically a flow of air forced through the stack by a compressor. Cathode gas<br>
flow channels are provided on the cathode side of the bipolar plates that allow<br>
the cathode gas to flow to the cathode side of the MEA. Not all of the oxygen<br>
is consumed by the stack and some of the air is output as a cathode exhaust<br>
gas that may include liquid water as a stack by-product. The bipolar plates<br>
may also include flow channels for a cooling fluid. An automotive fuel cell<br>
stack, for example, may include about two hundred or more bipolar plates.<br>
[0007]	The bipolar plates are typically made of a conductive material,<br>
such as stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, polymeric carbon composites, or<br>
graphite etc., so that they conduct the electricity generated by the fuel cells<br>
from one cell to the next cell and out of the stack. Metal bipolar plates<br>
typically produce a natural oxide on their outer surface that makes them<br>
resistant to corrosion. However, this oxide layer is not conductive, and thus<br>
increases the internal resistance of the fuel cell, reducing its electrical<br>
performance. Also, the oxide layer may frequently make the plates more<br>
hydrophobic.<br>
SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018]	The following description of the embodiment(s) is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
[0019]	Referring to FIG. 1, reactions that occur during startup and<br>
shutdown of the fuel cell in both the anode compartment and the cathode<br>
compartment are shown. Carbon corrosion may occur in the fuel during<br>
startup and shutdown operations.<br>
[0020]	In one embodiment, the cathode may include an oxygen<br>
evolution reaction (OER) catalyst and an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)<br>
catalyst. Each of the OER catalyst and the ORR catalyst may be supported<br>
on carbon, for example graphitized carbon. In one embodiment, the ORR<br>
catalyst may be Pt, and the ORR catalyst loading may be 50% or higher,<br>
where the loading is the weight percentage of Pt with respect to the total mass<br>
of Pt and carbon support material. In one embodiment, start/stop related<br>
degradation may be reduced by the incorporation of the OER catalyst into the<br>
cathode that is more active than the ORR catalyst, where the ORR catalyst<br>
may be Pt. In one embodiment, the start/stop related degradation may<br>
include carbon corrosion caused by startup/shutdown of the fuel cell and/or<br>
Global/local hydrogen starvation. In one embodiment, the OER catalyst may<br>
improve startup/shutdown durability without compromising fuel cell<br>
performance.<br>
 <br>
[0021]	The addition of OER catalyst in the cathode may enhance the<br>
activity of oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode. During fuel cell system<br>
start/stop, the H2/air front is generated in the anode as the H2 or air is flushed<br>
into the anode when the cathode is filled with air. The H2/air front in the<br>
anode results in the generation of the currents of hydrogen oxidation reaction<br>
(HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in different sections of the anode<br>
electrode. This ORR in the anode induces carbon corrosion reaction current<br>
in the cathode, which is to the right of ORR in the anode shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The current of HOR or ORR in the anode is equally balanced with the<br>
summation of the current of COR and OER in the cathode area, which is right<br>
opposite side of ORR in the anode. According to the charge conservation, the<br>
more OER current, the less the COR current. Therefore, the addition of active<br>
OER catalyst improves start/stop durability.<br>
[0022]	FIG. 2 shows cathode kinetics for a fuel cell cathode at 80°C,<br>
21kPa O2, 100kPa H2. As shown in FIG. 2, such a catalyst (OER catalyst)<br>
may allow the evolution of oxygen from electrolysis of water to occur at a<br>
lower potential than the OER on Pt. This results in an increase in current from<br>
OER and a reduction in current from carbon oxidation, thereby decreasing<br>
carbon corrosion. Referring to FIG. 2, line A is the carbon oxidation reaction<br>
(COR) with a platinum/carbon catalyst; line B is the carbon oxidation reaction<br>
(COR) with a platinum/graphitized carbon catalyst (Pt/Gr-C); and line C is the<br>
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a platinum/graphitized carbon catalyst<br>
(Pt/Gr-C). In one embodiment, the OER catalyst may have a higher activity<br>
than Pt at significantly lower loadings. In one embodiment, the carbon<br>
catalyst includes a conventional non-corrosion resistant carbon. In another<br>
 <br>
embodiment, the graphitized carbon catalyst includes a corrosion resistant<br>
carbon.<br>
[0023]	In one embodiment, membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs)<br>
with electrodes comprised of an OER catalyst supported on a corrosion-<br>
resistant carbon mixed with either conventional Pt/Vulcan or with Pt/corrosion-<br>
resistant carbon catalysts have been prepared and tested. In one<br>
embodiment, the OER catalyst may comprise an oxide of iridium or derivative<br>
thereof. In an embodiment the OER catalyst may comprise IrOx (iridium<br>
oxide), wherein x may range from 0 to 2. Start/stop degradation and relative<br>
carbon corrosion rates have been measured.<br>
[0024]	In one embodiment, a method of fabricating MEAs is provided<br>
including mixing an OER catalyst, for example IrOx, directly into a cathode<br>
catalyst ink. The cathode catalyst ink may include a first catalyst, an<br>
electrically conductive material, and a solvent. In one embodiment, the first<br>
catalyst may be an ORR catalyst. The ORR catalyst may be platinum. In<br>
various embodiments, the OER catalyst may be present in an amount ranging<br>
from about 0.1 wt% to about 10wt% of the first catalyst. In one embodiment,<br>
the catalyst ink may include an ionomer and a carbon support. The carbon<br>
support may be, for example, graphitized carbon. The ratio of ionomer to<br>
carbon may be between 0.6 and 2.0. In another embodiment, the ratio of<br>
ionomer to carbon may be between 0.8 to 1.0.<br>
[0025]	The cathode catalyst ink may then be applied and the MEA<br>
prepared according to methods known in the art. The cathode catalyst ink<br>
may be deposited on a polymer electrolyte membrane, a gas diffusion media<br>
layer, or a decal backing.<br>
 <br>
[0026]	In another embodiment, the OER catalyst may be deposited as<br>
a separate layer over the cathode. For example, in one embodiment the OER<br>
catalyst may be IrOx which may be formed as a separate layer on top of a Pt<br>
catalyst layer. The OER catalyst layer may be positioned between the<br>
electrode and the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM).<br>
[0027]	In one embodiment, IrOx loadings of 2wt% of the Pt loading (or<br>
1wt% with respect to total catalyst and carbon weight) have been found to<br>
significantly reduce start/stop degradation rates without compromising fuel cell<br>
performance. FIG. 3 shows model predictions of startup/shutdown<br>
degradation rates for an MEA containing 2wt% IrOx with respect to Pt loading<br>
using carbon oxidation reaction (COR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)<br>
kinetics. Based on the model predictions, the Pt/C (platinum/conventional<br>
carbon) + 2%lrOx has an improvement of four times that of Pt/C with no IrOx,<br>
and the PtGr-C (platinum/ graphitized carbon) + 2%lrOx has an improvement<br>
of twelve times that of Pt/Gr-C with no IrOx.<br>
[0028]	FIG. 4 shows polarization curves for the beginning of life<br>
performance of MEAs made with Pt/Vulcan with and without added IrOx. The<br>
conditions of FIG. 4 are 60°C, 100% RH, 270 kPa, and 2/2 H2/Air Stoic. FIG.<br>
5	shows polarization curves for the beginning of life performance of MEAs<br>
made with Pt/C with and without added IrOx, wherein there was no significant<br>
loss in performance with the addition of 0.008mglr/cm2 (2%lrOx), The<br>
conditions of FIG. 5 are 80°C, 32% RH, 150 kPa, and 1.5/2 H2/Air Stoic. FIG.<br>
6	shows polarization curves for beginning of life performance of MEAs made<br>
with Pt/Gr-C with and without added IrOx, wherein there was no significant<br>
<br>
 <br>
loss in performance with the addition of 0.008mglr/cm2 (2%lrOx). The<br>
conditions of FIG. 6 are 80°C, 32% RH, 150 kPa, and 1.5/2 H2/Air Stoic.<br>
[0029]	In one embodiment, an accelerated corrosion test was<br>
performed for Pt/C with and without IrOx. The corrosion potential for Pt/C at<br>
10mA/cm2 was about 150 mV higher than for Pt/C at 1 mA/cm2. The Tafel<br>
slope was about 150 mV/dec. The corrosion potential for Pt/C + IrOx at<br>
10mA/cm2 was about 80 mV higher than for Pt/C at 1 mA/cm2. In one<br>
embodiment, the OER may carry 67% of the corrosion current and the C-<br>
corrosion 33%. The addition of 2wt% IrOx/C to Pt/C resulted in a 3x<br>
improvement based on corrosion current and a 4x improvement based on<br>
time. In another embodiment, an accelerated corrosion test was performed<br>
for Pt/Gr-C with and without IrOx. The corrosion potential for Pt/Gr-C at<br>
10mA/cm2 was about 150 mV higher than for Pt/Gr-C at 1 mA/cm2. The Tafel<br>
slope was about 130 mV/dec. The corrosion potential for Pt/Gr-C + IrOx at<br>
lOmA/cm2 was approximately equivalent to the corrosion potential for Pt/Gr-C<br>
at 1 mA/cm2. In one embodiment, the OER may carry 90% of the corrosion<br>
current and the C-corrosion 10%. The addition of 2wt% IrOx/Gr-C to Pt/Gr-C<br>
resulted in a 10x improvement based on corrosion current and a 13x<br>
improvement based on time.<br>
[0030]	Referring to FIG. 7, one embodiment of the invention includes a<br>
product 10 comprising a fuel cell 12. The fuel cell 12 includes a first fuel cell<br>
bipolar plate 14 including a first face 16 having a reactant gas flow field<br>
defined therein by a plurality of lands 18 and channels 20. The reactant gas<br>
flow field may deliver a fuel on one side of the bipolar plate and an oxidant on<br>
the other side of the bipolar plate. The fuel cell 12 includes a second fuel cell<br>
 <br>
bipolar plate 22 including a first face 24 having a reactant gas flow field<br>
defined therein by a plurality of lands 26 and channels 28. The lands 18 or 26<br>
and channels 20 or 28 may be formed in the bipolar plate 14 or 22 by<br>
machining, etching, stamping, molding or the like. A soft goods portion 30<br>
may be provided between the first fuel cell bipolar plate 14 and the second<br>
fuel cell bipolar plate 22. The first fuel cell bipolar plate 14 and the second<br>
fuel cell bipolar plate 22 may include a variety of materials including, but not<br>
limited to, a metal, metal alloy, and/or electrically conductive composite. In<br>
one embodiment, the first fuel cell bipolar plate 14 and the second fuel cell<br>
bipolar plate 22 may be stainless steel.<br>
[0031]	The soft goods portion 30 may include a polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane (PEM) 32 comprising a first face 34 and a second face 36. A<br>
cathode electrode 38 may overlie the first face 34 of the polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane 32. In one embodiment, the cathode electrode 38 may include an<br>
OER catalyst, as described above. For example, the OER catalyst IrOx may<br>
be mixed with Pt catalyst as a single cathode electrode 38 layer. In another<br>
embodiment, the OER catalyst may form a separate oxygen evolution catalyst<br>
layer 39 positioned between the cathode electrode 38 and the membrane 32.<br>
A first gas diffusion media layer 40 may overlie the cathode electrode 38, and<br>
optionally a first microporous layer 42 may be interposed between the first gas<br>
diffusion media layer 40 and the cathode electrode 38. The first gas diffusion<br>
media layer 40 may be hydrophobic. The first fuel cell bipolar plate 14 may<br>
overlie the first gas diffusion media layer 40.<br>
[0032]	An anode electrode 46 may underlie the second face 36 of the<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane 32. A second gas diffusion media layer 48<br>
<br>
 <br>
may underlie the anode layer 46, and optionally a second microporous layer<br>
50 may be interposed between the second gas diffusion media layer 48 and<br>
the anode electrode 46. The second gas diffusion media layer 48 may be<br>
hydrophobia The second fuel cell bipolar plate 22 may overlie the second<br>
gas diffusion media layer 48.<br>
[0033]	In various embodiments, the polymer electrolyte membrane 32<br>
may comprise a variety of different types of membranes. The polymer<br>
electrolyte membrane 32 useful in various embodiments of the invention may<br>
be an ion-conductive material. Examples of suitable membranes are<br>
disclosed in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,272,353 and 3,134,689, and in the Journal of<br>
Power Sources, Volume 28 (1990), pages 367-387. Such membranes are<br>
also known as ion exchange resin membranes. The resins include ionic<br>
groups in their polymeric structure; one ionic component for which is fixed or<br>
retained by the polymeric matrix and at least one other ionic component being<br>
a mobile replaceable ion electrostatically associated with the fixed<br>
component. The ability of the mobile ion to be replaced under appropriate<br>
conditions with other ions imparts ion exchange characteristics to these<br>
materials.<br>
[0034]	The ion exchange resins can be prepared by polymerizing a<br>
mixture of ingredients, one of which contains an ionic constituent. One broad<br>
class of cationic exchange, proton conductive resins is the so-called sulfonic<br>
acid cationic exchange resin. In the sulfonic acid membranes, the cationic<br>
exchange groups are sulfonic acid groups which are attached to the polymer<br>
backbone.<br>
<br>
 <br>
[0035]	The formation of these ion exchange resins into membranes or<br>
chutes is well-known to those skilled in the art. The preferred type is<br>
perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer electrolyte in which the entire membrane<br>
structure has ionic exchange characteristics. These membranes are<br>
commercially available, and a typical example of a commercial sulfonic<br>
perfluorocarbon proton conductive membrane is sold by E. I. DuPont D<br>
Nemours &amp; Company under the trade designation NAFION. Other such<br>
membranes are available from Asahi Glass and Asahi Chemical Company.<br>
The use of other types of membranes, such as, but not limited to,<br>
perfluorinated cation-exchange membranes, hydrocarbon based cation-<br>
exchange membranes as well as anion-exchange membranes are also within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
[0036]	In one embodiment, the first gas diffusion media layer 40 or the<br>
second gas diffusion media layer 48 may include any electrically conductive<br>
porous material. In various embodiments, the gas diffusion media layer may<br>
include non-woven carbon fiber paper or woven carbon cloth which may be<br>
treated with a hydrophobic material, such as, but not limited to, polymers of<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), fluroethylene propylene, or<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The gas diffusion media layer may have an<br>
average pore size ranging from 5-40 micrometers. The gas diffusion media<br>
layer may have a thickness ranging from about 100 to about 500 micrometers.<br>
[0037]	In one embodiment, the electrodes (cathode layer 38 and anode<br>
layer 46) may be catalyst layers which may include catalyst particles such as<br>
platinum, and an ion conductive material such as a proton conducting<br>
ionomer, intermingled with the particles. The proton conductive material may<br>
<br>
 <br>
be an ionomer such as a perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer. The catalyst<br>
materials may include metals such as platinum, palladium, molybdenum,<br>
cobalt, ruthenium, nickel, or tin, or mixtures of metals such as platinum and<br>
molybdenum, platinum and cobalt, platinum and ruthenium, platinum and<br>
nickel, platinum and tin, other platinum transition-metal alloys, and other fuel<br>
cell electrocatalysts known in the art. The catalyst materials may be finely<br>
divided if desired. The catalyst materials may be unsupported or supported<br>
on a variety of materials such as but not limited to finely divided carbon<br>
particles. In one embodiment, the cathode electrode 38 may be formed from<br>
a cathode catalyst ink including a first catalyst, an oxygen evolution reaction<br>
catalyst, and a solvent. The cathode electrode 38 may also include an<br>
electrically conductive material for supporting the catalyst such as carbon or<br>
other conductive materials in the form of particles having solid or hollow<br>
cores.<br>
[0038]	In one embodiment, the first microporous layer 42 or the second<br>
microporous layer 50 may be made from materials such as carbon blacks and<br>
hydrophobic constituents such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and may have a thickness ranging from about<br>
2 to about 100 micrometers. In one embodiment the microporous layer may<br>
include a plurality of particles, for example including graphitized carbon, and a<br>
binder. In one embodiment the binder may include a hydrophobic polymer<br>
such as, but not limited to, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), fluoroethylene<br>
