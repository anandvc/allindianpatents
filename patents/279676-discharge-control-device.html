[Title of the Invention] Discharge Control Device<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a discharge control device of an electrically-driven vehicle, and more particularly to a discharge control device which discharges a charge stored in a smoothing capacitor connected to an inverter circuit for driving a traveling-use electrically-operated motor of an electrically-driven motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
In an electrically-driven vehicle, a rated voltage (for example, 72V) of a battery for driving an electrically-operated motor and a rated voltage (for example, 12V) for operating control equipment such as an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) or a motor controller largely differ from each other. Accordingly, the electrically-driven vehicle includes a main battery (high-voltage battery) which generates a high voltage (72V) for a drive motor as well as a sub battery (low-voltage battery) which generates a low voltage (12V) for control equipment. Further, general-use electrical equipment such as a headlight mounted on the electrically-driven vehicle is usually constituted of an ordinary part (a part used in a motorcycle which mounts an internal combustion engine thereon) driven by a low-voltage battery from a viewpoint of general-use property.<br>
 [0003]<br>
In the electrically-driven vehicle, the electrically-operated motor is driven by converting a DC voltage from the high-voltage battery into a three.-phase AC voltage by an inverter circuit. A smoothing capacitor (a charge storing means) of large capacity which mainly aims at the absorption of fluctuation of power source voltage is connected to an input side of the inverter circuit, and the smoothing capacitor is charged when the traveling of the electrically-driven vehicle starts. <br>
[0004]<br>
On the other hand, when the traveling of the electrically-driven vehicle in a state where the smoothing capacitor is charged is not expected, the smoothing capacitor is left for a long time in a charged state thus giving rise to a drawback that a lifetime of the smoothing capacitor is shortened. <br>
[0005]<br>
To overcome such a drawback, there has been proposed an idea where a drive control device of an electrically-driven vehicle includes a discharge circuit for discharging a charge stored in a smoothing capacitor (see patent document 1).<br>
[Prior art literature]<br>

An output shaft 43 is supported on a bearing 60 which is fitted in a power transmission casing 68 of the swing arm 12 on a right side of the electrically-operated motor 50 in the drawing. Further, as described above, the motor drive shaft 53 is supported on the bearing 59 on a left side of the electrically-operated motor 50 in the drawing. Accordingly, the motor drive shaft 53 and the output shaft 43 are supported at two points, that is, on left and right sides of the electrically-operated motor 50 in the vehicle width direction and hence, for example, compared to the structure in which the respective shafts are supported at only one point on one side, it is possible to miniaturize the bearings 59, 60. Here, an oil seal 77 is arranged on a left side of the bearing 60 in the drawing.<br>
 [0037]<br>
The centrifugal clutch 40 is constituted of a drive plate 42 on which a clutch shoe 44 is mounted, and a clutch outer 41 which is rotated by a frictional resistance force of the clutch shoe 44. The drive plate 42 is fixed to a left end portion of the motor drive shaft 53 in the drawing, while the clutch outer 41 is fixed to the output shaft 43 which is rotatably inserted into the motor drive shaft 53 using a nut 66. Here, the motor drive shaft 53 and the output shaft 43 are constituted so as to allow the relative rotation therebetween using two needle roller bearings 75, 76.<br>
 [0038]<br>
The centrifugal clutch 40 is constituted such that, when the motor drive shaft 53 is rotated at a predetermined rotational speed or more, that is, when the drive plate 42 is rotated at a predetermined rotational speed or more, the clutch shoe 44 is moved radially outward thus generating a frictional resistance force so that the clutch outer 41 is rotated. Due to such a constitution, a rotational drive force of the electrically-operated motor 50 is transmitted to the output shaft 43.                                                               <br>
[0039]<br>
The rotational drive force transmitted to the output shaft 43 is transmitted to a final output shaft 48 (axle 19) by way of the speed reduction mechanism 70. To be more in detail, the rotational drive force transmitted to the output shaft 43 is transmitted to the final output shaft 48 which is fixed to the second speed-reduction gear 47 and is rotatably and pivotally supported on a bearing 80 fitted in the power transmission casing 68 and a bearing 82 fitted in a speed-reduction-gear casing 67 by way of the first speed-reduction gear 46 which is meshed with a speed-reduction gear 43a formed on a right end portion of the output shaft 43 in the drawing, a first speed-reduction shaft 45 which is fixed to the first speed-reduction gear 46 and is rotatably and pivotally supported on a bearing 79 fitted in the speed-reduction-gear casing 67 and a bearing 78 fitted in the power transmission casing 68, and the second speed-reduction gear 47 which is meshed with a speed reduction gear 45a formed on the first speed-reduction shaft 45. <br>
[0040]<br>
A wheel 56 of the rear wheel WR is fixed to a right end portion of the final output shaft 48 in the drawing by way of a collar 69 using a nut 72. A brake drum which includes a liner 85 is formed on a radially inner side of the wheel 56, and a pair of upper and lower brake shoes 83 which is driven by a brake cam 49 using an anchor pin 84 as an axis is housed in the brake drum. Here, an oil seal 81 is arranged on a left side of the bearing 82 in the drawing. Further, a swing arm casing 12a which is formed as an integral body is arranged outside the smoothing capacitor 3 6 and the centrifugal clutch 40 in the vehicle width direction.<br>
[0041]<br>
Next/ the drive control device of the electrically-driven vehicle which includes a discharge control device of the present invention is explained in conjunction with block diagrams shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respectively. Fig. 5 is the block diagram of the drive control device when the main switch 110 is in a closed state, and Fig. 6 is the block diagram of the drive control device when the main switch 110 is in an open state.<br>
[0042]<br>
The drive control device is constituted of the low-voltage battery (sub battery) 30 which generates a low voltage (12V) for the control equipments, the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 which generates a high-voltage(72V) for the drive motor, the electrically-operated motor 50 which is driven based on a voltage supplied from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31, the drive part<br>
(motor driver) 35 which includes an inverter circuit 350 which converts a DC voltage supplied from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 into an AC voltage and drives the electrically-operated motor 50, and the MGU (control device) 34 which performs a control of the drive part<br>
(motor driver) 35.<br>
[0043]<br>
A high voltage (72V) is supplied to the inverter circuit 350 of the drive part (motor driver) 35 from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 and, at the same time, the smoothing capacitor 36 which absorbs voltage fluctuation by smoothing a DC voltage which flows between the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 and the inverter circuit 350 is connected to the inverter circuit 350. <br>
[0044]<br>
The electrically-operated motor 50 is driven by a three-phase AC voltage (U-phase line 27, V-phase line 28, W-phase line 29) which is obtained by converting a DC voltage supplied from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 by the inverter circuit 350. [0045]<br>
The high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 is connected to a circuit means 100 which is constituted of the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 and a lighting equipment 90 by way of a relay switch (switch means) 120 which is turned on or off in response to a contactor operation based on an ON/OFF operation of the main switch 110. Further, the power converter (DC-DC converter; down converter) 32 is connected to the drive part (motor driver) 35 and the MGU (control device) 34.<br>
The relay switch (switch means) 120 is controlled such that the relay switch 120 assumes a closed state when the main switch 110 is turned on so that the contactor operation is turned on/ and the relay switch 120 assumes an open state when the main switch 110 is turned off so that the contactor operation is turned off.<br>
In the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32, an output voltage (72V) of the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 is dropped to 12V using a DC/DC converter and the dropped voltage is supplied to the MGU (control device) 34 and the drive part (motor driver) 35 and, at the same time, the dropped voltage is applied to the low-voltage battery (sub battery) 30 thus charging the low-voltage battery (sub battery) 30. <br>
[0046]<br>
The high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 is connected to a charger 310. By connecting the charger 310 to a household-use commercial power source (external power source) or the like via a plug socket 320, it is possible to charge the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31.<br>
 [0047]<br>
Further, the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 includes a battery management substrate (BMU) 330 so that the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 monitors a charging state of the battery charged by the charger 310 and, at the same time, monitors a charging state of the low-voltage battery (sub battery) 30 by receiving a signal<br>
from the MGU (control device) 34 through CAN communication.<br>
 [0048]<br>
The low-voltage battery (sub battery) 30 is connected to general-use electrical equipment 150 which is constituted of a blinker, a stop lamp, a horn, meters and the like via the main switch 110. The respective equipment are configured to be operated (lit) when the main switch 110 is turned on so that a voltage of 12V is supplied to the respective equipment. Further, the low-voltage battery (sub battery) 30 operates the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 by supplying a voltage of 12V to the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 and, at the same time, is also connected to the drive part (motor driver) 35 and the MGU (control device) 34 so as to supply a voltage of ;12V to the drive part (motor driver) 35 and the MGU (control device) 34 as an auxiliary power source. <br>
[0049]<br>
To the smoothing capacitor 36 which is connected to the inverter circuit 350 of the drive part (motor driver) 35, the circuit means 100 which is constituted of the 12V-use lighting equipment 90 consisting of the headlight 10 and the taillight device 16 and the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 is connected. By connecting the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 to the smoothing capacitor 36, a voltage generated by the smoothing capacitor 36 can be converted into a voltage to be supplied to the above-mentioned electrical equipment load of the electrically-driven vehicle.<br>
The 12V-use lighting equipment 90 is constituted of a headlight 91 which allows the selection of a high-beam light 91a or a low beam light 91b by the switch 92 and is mounted on a front side of the electrically-driven motorcycle, a taillight 93 which is mounted on a rear side of the electrically-driven motorcycle, and a position light 94 which is arranged in the vicinity of the headlight. The high beam light 91(a and the low beam light 91b which constitute the headlight (91) of the lighting equipment<br>
(90) are configured such that either one of the high beam light 91a and the low beam light 91b is always lit when the main switch (110) is turned on.<br>
A light emitting diode 95 which is connected in parallel to the high beam light 91a of the headlight 91 is an indicator lamp which is lit in the meter unit 8 when a high beam mode is selected. The headlight 91 requires the high illuminance compared to the taillight 93 and hence, a light having a large resistance value (load) is used as the headlight 91.<br>
[0050]<br>
Further, to the smoothing capacitor 36 which is connected to the inverter circuit 350 of the drive part (motor driver) 35, the lighting equipment 90 is connected via the power converter (DC-DC converter; down converter) 32 and hence, a charge stored in the smoothing capacitor 36 can be discharged via the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32.<br>
Here, a voltage which is supplied to the lighting equipment 90 is dropped to a low voltage (12V) from a high voltage (72V) by the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 and hence, it is possible to use lighting equipment manufactured based on a usually-used standard (rated voltage 12V). <br>
[0051]<br>
The MGU (control device) 34 performs monitoring of a voltage level of the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 or the like by receiving inputting of a control signal from the TH sensor (throttle opening sensor) 341 which detects throttle opening, a control signal from the stand switch 342 which detects a lifting/lowering state of the center stand 18, and a control signal from the seat switch 343 which recognizes whether or not the rider rides on the vehicle. The MGU 34 also controls driving of the electrically-operated motor 50 by performing an electricity supply control to the inverter circuit 350 of the drive part (motor driver) 35 corresponding to a detection value of the above-mentioned TH sensor (throttle opening sensor) 341 and a detection value of the motor rotational speed sensor 72 of the electrically-operated motor 50 thus controlling driving of the electrically-operated motor 50.<br>
 [0052]<br>
Next, the manner of operation of the above-mentioned discharge control device is explained. When the main switch 110 is turned on and assumes the closed state shown in Fig. 5, the relay switch (switch means) 120 is turned on so that an electric current flows in a path indicated by a dotted line in Fig. 5 from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31. Accordingly, the 12V-use lighting equipment 90 is lit based on a voltage supplied via the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 and, at the same time, the electrically-operated motor 50 assumes a driving ready state via the drive part (motor driver) 35. A voltage of 12V is supplied to the general-use electrical equipment 150 from the low-voltage battery (sub battery) 30 via the main switch 110 so as to operate (turn on) the respective electrical equipments. <br>
[0053]<br>
When a start switch (not shown in the drawing) is turned on in such a state, the electrically-operated motor 50 is started so that a DC voltage supplied from the high-<br>
voltage battery (main battery) 31 is converted into a three-phase AC voltage by the inverter circuit 350 whereby the electrically-operated motor 50 is driven. Here, a charge is stored in the smoothing capacitor (charge storing means) 36 which is connected to an input side of the inverter circuit 350 to absorb fluctuation of power supply voltage mainly.  <br>
[0054]<br>
When the main switch 110 is turned off and assumes an open state as shown in Fig. 6, the relay switch (switch means) 120 is turned off so that the supply of electricity to the lighting equipment 90 from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 via the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32 and the supply of electricity to the electrically-operated motor 50 from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 via the drive part (motor driver) 35 are interrupted and, at the same time, charging of the smoothing capacitor 36 side is also interrupted. <br>
[0055]<br>
Further, a charge which is charged in the smoothing capacitor 36 flows into the lighting equipment (headlight 91, taillight 93 and position light 94) 90 side via the power converter (DC-DC converter; down converter) 32 along a path indicated by a dotted line in Fig. 6, and the charge is discharged when a dropped voltage is applied to the<br>
lighting equipment 90 so that the lighting equipment 90 is lit.<br>
[0056]<br>
Accordingly, at the time of "traveling" of the electrically-driven vehicle, at the time of stopping traveling" of the electrically-driven vehicle, at the time of "turning off the main switch" where the main switch 110 assumes an open state, at the time of "outputting a charge to the H/L (headlight)" where a charge of the smoothing capacitor 36 flows into the lighting equipment 90 side, and at the time of "system down" where a discharge by the discharge control device is completed, (1) a state of "output DownREG to H/L" which indicates the presence or the absence of an output from the power converter (DC-DC converter: down converter) 32, (2) a state of "output to general-use electrical equipment" which indicates the presence or the absence of the output to the general-use electrical equipment 150, (3) a state of "contactor operation" which indicates an operation state of the relay switch 120, and (4) a state of "system started or down" which indicates an activation state of the drive control device including the discharge control device become as shown in Fig. 7. <br>
[0057]<br>
That is, at the time of "traveling" of the electrically-driven vehicle 1, the main switch 110 and the relay switch (switch means) 120 assume a closed state and hence, the "output DownREG to H/L" is in an ^^ON" (present) state, the state "output to general-use electrical equipment" is in an "ON" (present) state. The relay switch (switch means) 120 assumes a closed state, accordingly, the "contactor operation" is in an "ON" state, and the "system started or down" is in a start state.<br>
At the time of "stopping traveling" of the electrically-driven vehicle where the traveling of the electrically-driven vehicle 1 is stopped, only the electrically-operated motor 50 is stopped and the above-mentioned states are maintained.<br>
[0058]<br>
At the time of "turning off the main switch" where the main switch 110 is turned off, the supply of voltage of 12V to the general-use electrical equipment 150 is interrupted based on the above-mentioned state. Accordingly, the "output to general-use electrical equipment" state assumes an "OFF" (absent) state and, at the same time, the "contactor operation" assumes an "OFF" state so that the relay switch (switch means) 120 assumes an open state whereby the supply of voltage from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 is interrupted. However, the "outputting a charge to the H/L (headlight)" state<br>
where the charge flows from the smoothing capacitor 36 assumes an ON state and hence, the "output DownREG to H/L" is maintained at an "ON" (present) state.<br>
At the time of ''system down" where the discharge of a charge stored in the smoothing capacitor 36 by the discharge control device is completed, all of the "output DownREG to H/L" state, the "output to general-use electrical equipment" state and the "contactor operation" state assume an OFF state.<br>
 [0059]<br>
In the motorcycle, the lighting equipment (the headlight 91, the taillight 93 and the position light 94) 90 is lit during traveling even during the daytime and hence, a voltage of 12V is supplied to the lighting equipment 90 when the main switch 110 is turned on. According to the above-mentioned structure, when the main switch 110 is turned off, although the supply of voltage from the high-voltage battery (main battery) 31 is interrupted, a charge stored in the smoothing capacitor 36 flows via the power converter (DC-DC converter; down converter) 32 and hence, a voltage of 12V is supplied to the lighting equipment 90.<br>
 [0060]<br>
In this example, an electric current flows into all lighting equipment 90 consisting of the headlight 91, the taillight 93 and the position light 94 at the time of discharging a charge stored in the smoothing capacitor 36. However, it may be possible to allow an electric current to flow into any one of the headlight 91, the taillight 93 and the position light 94. Further, by incorporating the headlight 91 into the lighting equipment 90 into which a discharged current flows, the resistance having a large load (a load which exhibits large power consumption) can be used and hence, it is possible to discharge a charge of the smoothing capacitor 36 readily. <br>
[0061]<br>
Further, to inform a rider who rides on the electrically-driven vehicle of discharging of a charge to the lighting equipment 90 such as the headlight 91, it may be possible to arrange an indicator (not shown in the drawing) which is lit at the time of discharging a charge to the lighting equipment 90 in the inside of the meter unit 8 of the electrically-driven vehicle 1. Due to such a constitution, the rider can recognize that the lighting of the lighting equipment 90 after the main switch 110 is turned off is generated by the discharge.
