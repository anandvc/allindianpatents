SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING FUEL INJECTORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to internal combustion<br>
engines, and more particularly to control systems for fuel injectors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Fuel and air injection quantities delivered to an engine are<br>
controlled to meet fuel economy requirements and emission standards.<br>
Closed loop control systems sense oxygen levels in exhaust flowing from the<br>
engine in order to control air and fuel quantities flowing into the engine.<br>
[0004] When engine components such as fuel injectors function<br>
improperly, fuel injection quantities delivered to the engine may vary from<br>
desired levels. Variations and/or degradation among the fuel injectors may<br>
result in inaccurate fuel injection quantities being delivered to the engine. The<br>
delivery of inaccurate fuel injection quantities to the engine may increase<br>
emissions and/or decrease fuel economy.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
2<br>
[0006] An injector control system and method for an engine includes<br>
a distribution module that calculates a difference between a first average<br>
engine speed and a second average engine speed of an engine and a fuel<br>
offset module that offsets a learned fuel amount of a first fuel injector of a<br>
plurality of fuel injectors based on the difference. The learned fuel amount<br>
corresponds to an engine fueling range.<br>
[0007] In other features, the distribution module maintains current<br>
fueling quantities of the plurality of fuel injectors. The distribution module<br>
determines the first average engine speed. The distribution module<br>
distributes an injector fuel removal amount removed from the first fuel injector<br>
to other fuel injectors of the plurality of injectors. The distribution module<br>
determines the second average engine speed after the distribution of the<br>
injector fuel removal amount.<br>
[0008] In other features, the control system further comprises an<br>
activation module that enables the control system when the activation module<br>
determines that the engine is operating at a steady-state operating point. The<br>
activation module determines that the engine is operating at a steady-state<br>
condition based on a set of stability conditions that include at least one of an<br>
engine coolant temperature exceeding a calibrated engine coolant<br>
temperature, a torque output demand on the engine remaining stable for a<br>
first period of time, and the control system remaining inactive for a second<br>
period of time.<br>
[0009] In other features, the distribution module determines the first<br>
and second average engine speeds based on a calibrated number of<br>
revolutions of the engine and the distribution module reads the fuel removal<br>
amount from a fuel removal array based on a speed variation of the engine.<br>
The fuel offset module compares the difference to an engine speed variation<br>
value read from an engine speed variation array and the fuel offset module<br>
decrements a fueling level value when the difference exceeds the engine<br>
speed variation value and increments the fueling level value when the<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
3<br>
difference is less than the engine speed variation value. The distribution<br>
module releases control of the current fueling quantities of the plurality of fuel<br>
injectors.<br>
[0010] In other features, the fuel offset module increments an<br>
injector sample value and the fuel offset module adjusts the learned fuel<br>
amount when the injector sample value exceeds a sample threshold. The fuel<br>
offset module subtracts a calibrated fuel amount from the learned fuel amount<br>
when the fueling level value falls below a fueling level threshold and the fuel<br>
offset module adds the calibrated fuel amount to the learned fuel amount<br>
when the fueling level exceeds the fueling level threshold. The fuel offset<br>
module adds the learned fuel amount to a desired fueling quantity of the first<br>
fuel injector at the engine fueling range.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein,<br>
activated refers to operation using all of the engine cylinders. Deactivated<br>
refers to operation using less than all of the cylinders of the engine (one or<br>
more cylinders not active). As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor<br>
(shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software<br>
or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable<br>
components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary engine system 10<br>
includes an engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive<br>
torque. Air is drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a compressor 16. Air<br>
within the intake manifold 14 is distributed into cylinders 18. Although four<br>
cylinders 18 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine system can<br>
be implemented in diesel engines having a plurality of cylinders including, but<br>
not limited to, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders.<br>
[0017] Air is drawn into the cylinder 18 through an intake port. A<br>
fuel rail 20 supplies fuel to fuel injectors 22. The fuel injector 22 directly<br>
injects fuel into the cylinder 18. An intake valve 24 selectively opens and<br>
closes to enable air to enter the cylinder 18. A piston (not shown)<br>
compresses the air/fuel mixture within the cylinder 18. Heat from the<br>
compressed mixture ignites the fuel generating force to drive the piston. The<br>
piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque.<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
5<br>
[0018] Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 18 is forced out<br>
through an exhaust manifold 26 when an exhaust valve 28 is in an open<br>
position. Exhaust is treated in an exhaust system (not shown). Although<br>
single intake and exhaust valves 24 and 28 are illustrated, it can be<br>
appreciated that the engine 12 can include multiple intake and exhaust valves<br>
24 and 28 per cylinder 18.<br>
[0019] A control module 30 determines and controls a fuel injection<br>
quantity to be supplied to each cylinder 18 based on engine operating<br>
conditions. The control module 30 communicates with various components of<br>
the engine system 10 including, but not limited to, an engine speed sensor 32<br>
and an engine coolant temperature sensor 34. The engine speed sensor 32<br>
is responsive to a rotational speed of the engine 12 and generates an engine<br>
speed signal in revolutions per minute (RPM). The coolant temperature<br>
sensor 34 senses the coolant temperature within the engine 12 and generates<br>
a coolant temperature signal indicating an operating temperature of the<br>
engine 12. The control module 30 determines an operating point of the<br>
engine 12 based on at least one of the engine speed signal, the Tcool signal,<br>
and a fuel demand level of the engine 12.<br>
[0020] An injector control system of the present disclosure supplies<br>
learned fuel amounts to offset the desired fueling quantity of each of the fuel<br>
injectors 22 at various fueling ranges of the engine 12, thereby compensating<br>
for physical and functional variations and/or degradation of the injectors 22<br>
that typically result in over or under fueling. Although an injector control<br>
system is shown operating in a diesel engine 12, those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the present disclosure contemplates the use of the injector<br>
control system in an internal combustion engine.<br>
[0021] Referring now to FIG. 2, the control module 30 includes a<br>
memory module 40. The memory module 40 includes a fuel removal array<br>
42, an engine speed variation array 44, and fuel learn arrays 46. The fuel<br>
removal array 42 stores a set of injector fuel amounts based on engine speed<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
6<br>
variation over a calibrated number of revolutions of the engine 12. The<br>
engine speed variation array 44 stores engine speed variation values based<br>
on engine operation conditions that include, but are not limited to, desired<br>
fueling ranges of the engine 12 and engine speed. The fuel learn arrays 46<br>
store "learned" fuel amounts for the fuel injectors 22 calculated by an injector<br>
control system 50.<br>
[0022] The control module 30 supplies the learned fuel amounts to<br>
offset the desired fueling quantity of the fuel injectors 22 at various fueling<br>
ranges of the engine 12. In the present implementation, the control module<br>
30 stores one of the fuel learn arrays 46 for each of the fuel injectors 22.<br>
Additionally, each of the fuel learn arrays 46 include a plurality of cells<br>
respectively associated with each fueling range of the engine 12.<br>
[0023] An activation module 48 communicates with the engine<br>
speed sensor 32 and the engine coolant temperature sensor 34. The<br>
activation module 48 determines whether the engine 12 is operating at a<br>
steady-state operating point by checking three stability conditions: (1) whether<br>
the engine coolant temperature exceeds a calibrated engine coolant<br>
temperature; (2) whether the torque output demanded by a driver/operator of<br>
the engine system 10 remains stable for a period of time; and (3) whether the<br>
injector control system 50 has remained inactive for a period of time. If all<br>
three conditions are met, the activation module 48 enables the injector control<br>
system 50.<br>
[0024] The injector control system 50 includes a distribution module<br>
52 and a fuel offset module 54. The injector control system 50 operates on<br>
each of the fuel injectors 22 individually and in identical fashion. In the<br>
present implementation, the injector control system 50 cycles through each of<br>
the fuel injectors 22 during a single operating cycle of the injector control<br>
system 50 as described below.<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
7<br>
[0025] The distribution module 52 "freezes", or maintains, the<br>
current fueling quantities of each of the fuel injectors 22 and determines a first<br>
average engine speed over a calibrated number of revolutions of the engine<br>
12. The distribution module 52 then reads an injector fuel removal amount<br>
from the fuel removal array 42 based on a current speed variation of the<br>
engine 12 determined by the distribution module 52. The distribution module<br>
52 transmits a fuel removal command to remove the injector fuel removal<br>
amount from a first fuel injector of the fuel injectors 22. The distribution<br>
module 52 equally distributes the injector fuel removal amount to other fuel<br>
injectors of the fuel injectors 22.<br>
[0026] The distribution module 52 determines a second average<br>
engine speed experienced by the engine system 10 after the injector fuel<br>
removal amount is distributed to the other fuel injectors 22. In the present<br>
implementation, the distribution module 52 calculates the second average<br>
engine speed over the calibrated number of revolutions. Preferably, during<br>
the calibrated number of revolutions, the engine system 10 does not respond<br>
to changes in speed (i.e. torque output) demanded by the driver/operator.<br>
The distribution module 52 calculates a difference between the first and<br>
second average engine speeds.<br>
[0027] The fuel offset module 54 compares an absolute value of the<br>
difference in average engine speeds to a corresponding engine speed<br>
variation value read from the engine speed variation array 44. In the present<br>
implementation, the engine speed variation values can be calibrated. If the<br>
absolute value exceeds the engine speed variation value, the fuel offset<br>
module 54 determines whether the second average engine speed exceeds<br>
the first average engine speed. If the second average engine speed exceeds<br>
the first average engine speed, the fuel offset module 54 determines that the<br>
first fuel injector is operating in an under fueling state at the current desired<br>
fueling range and increments a fueling level value. If the second average<br>
engine speed falls below the first average engine speed, the fuel offset<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
8<br>
module 54 determines that the first fuel injector is operating in an over fueling<br>
state at the current desired fueling range and decrements the fueling level<br>
value.<br>
[0028] The fuel offset module 54 then increments an injector<br>
sample value and determines whether the injector sample value exceeds a<br>
calibrated sample threshold. If the injector sample value exceeds the sample<br>
threshold, the<br>
fuel offset module 54 adjusts a learned fuel amount associated with the first<br>
fuel injector at the current desired fueling range based on the fueling level<br>
value. If an absolute value of the fueling level value exceeds a fueling level<br>
threshold, the fuel offset module 54 determines whether the fueling level value<br>
exceeds a fueling level threshold. If the fueling level value exceeds a fueling<br>
level threshold, the fuel offset module 54 adds a calibrated fuel amount to the<br>
learned fuel amount. If the fueling level value falls below the fueling level<br>
threshold, the fuel offset module 54 subtracts the calibrated fuel amount from<br>
the learned fuel amount.<br>
[0029] Upon adjusting the learned fuel amount of the first fuel<br>
injector, the fuel offset module 54 adds the learned fuel amount to the desired<br>
fueling quantity at the current fueling range of the first fuel injector. The<br>
distribution module releases control over the fueling quantities of the fuel<br>
injectors 22. The fuel offset module 54 proceeds to clear the values of the<br>
sample value and the fueling level value of the first fuel injector. In other<br>
words, the fuel offset module 54 adjusts the learned fuel amount supplied to<br>
the first fuel injector based on whether the first fuel injector is over fueling or<br>
under fueling at a current desired fueling range.<br>
[0030] In the present implementation, the injector control system 50<br>
operates on each of the fuel injectors 22 consecutively. Additionally, the<br>
injector control system 50 remains inactive for a period of time between<br>
operations of the injector control system 50.<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
9<br>
[0031] Referring now to FIG. 3, an exemplary method 300 for<br>
operating the injector control system 50 will be described in more detail. The<br>
method 300 is executed for each of the fuel injectors 22. Control begins the<br>
method 300 at step 302. In step 304, control determines whether the engine<br>
12 is operating at a steady-state operating point. If the engine 12 is not<br>
operating at steady-state operating point, the method 300 returns to step 304.<br>
If the engine 12 is operating at a steady-state operating point, control<br>
proceeds to step 306. In step 306, control freezes the fueling quantities of the<br>
injectors 22. In step 308, control determines a first average engine speed of<br>
the engine 12. In step 310, control removes an injector fuel amount from a<br>
first injector and distributes the injector fuel amount to the other fuel injectors<br>
of the fuel injectors 22.<br>
[0032] In step 312, control determines a second average engine<br>
speed of the engine 12. In step 314, control determines a difference between<br>
the first and second average engine speeds. In step 316, control determines<br>
whether an absolute value of the difference between the first and second<br>
average engine speeds exceeds an engine speed variation value. If the<br>
absolute value exceeds the engine speed variation value, control proceeds to<br>
step 318. In step 318, control determines whether second average engine<br>
speed exceeds the first average engine speed. If the second average engine<br>
speed falls below the first average engine speed, control decrements a fueling<br>
level value in step 320. If the second average engine speed exceeds the first<br>
average engine speed, control increments the fueling level value in step 322.<br>
[0033] In step 324, control increments a sample value. In step 326,<br>
control determines whether the sample value exceeds a sample threshold. If<br>
the sample value does not exceed the sample threshold, control returns to<br>
step 308. If the sample value does exceed the sample threshold, control<br>
proceeds to step 328. In step 328, control determines whether an absolute<br>
value of the fueling level value exceeds a fueling variation. If the absolute<br>
value does not exceed the fueling variation, control proceeds to step 340. If<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
10<br>
the absolute value does exceed the fueling variation, control proceeds to step<br>
330. In step 330, control determines whether the fueling level value exceeds<br>
a fueling threshold (e.g. zero). If the fueling exceeds the fueling threshold,<br>
control adds a calibrated fuel amount to a learned fuel amount for the first<br>
injector at the current fueling range in step 332. If the fueling level value falls<br>
below the fueling threshold, control subtracts the calibrated fuel amount from<br>
the learned fuel amount. In step 336, control unfreezes the fueling quantities<br>
of the fuel injectors 22 and offsets the desired fueling quantity of the first<br>
injector with the learned fuel amount. In step 338, control clears the sample<br>
and fueling level values associated with the first fuel injector at the current<br>
fueling range. In step 340, the method 300 ends.<br>
[0034] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>

distribution of said injector fuel removal amount.<br>
13.	The method of claim 11 further comprising enabling said method<br>
when said engine operates at a steady-state operating point.<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
14<br>
14.	The method of claim 13 further comprising determining that said<br>
engine is operating at a steady-state condition based on a set of stability<br>
conditions that include at least one of an engine coolant temperature<br>
exceeding a calibrated engine coolant temperature, a torque output demand<br>
5 on said engine remaining stable for a first period of time, and said control<br>
system remaining inactive for a second period of time.<br>
15.	The method of claim 11 further comprising determining said first<br>
and second average engine speeds based on a calibrated number of<br>
revolutions of said engine and reading said fuel removal amount from a fuel<br>
removal array based on a speed variation of said engine.<br>
16.	The method of claim 11 further comprising comparing said<br>
difference to an engine speed variation value read from an engine speed<br>
variation array and decrementing a fueling level value when said difference<br>
exceeds said engine speed variation value and incrementing said fueling level<br>
5 value when said difference is less than said engine speed variation value.<br>
17.	The method of claim 16 further comprising incrementing an<br>
injector sample value and adjusting said learned fuel amount when said<br>
injector sample value exceeds a sample threshold.<br>
18.	The method of claim 17 further comprising subtracting a<br>
calibrated fuel amount from said learned fuel amount when said fueling level<br>
value falls below a fueling level threshold and adding said calibrated fuel<br>
amount to said learned fuel amount when said fueling level exceeds said<br>
5 fueling level threshold.<br><br>
GP-308234-PTT-CD<br>
15<br>
19.	The method of claim 18 further comprising adding said learned<br>
fuel amount to a desired fueling quantity of said first fuel injector at said<br>
engine fueling range.<br>
20.	The method of claim 12 further comprising releasing control of<br>
said current fueling quantities of said plurality of fuel injectors.<br><br>
An injector control system and method for an engine includes a<br>
distribution module that calculates a difference between a first average engine<br>
speed and a second average engine speed of an engine and a fuel offset<br>
module that offsets a learned fuel amount of a first fuel injector of a plurality of<br>
fuel injectors based on the difference. The learned fuel amount corresponds<br>
to an engine fueling range.<br></td>
