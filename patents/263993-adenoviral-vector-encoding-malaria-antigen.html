				<td>Field of the invention<br><br>
The invention relates to recombinant adenoviral vectors which are capable of eliciting immunity against the pre- erythrocytic stage of the life cycle of the malaria parasite. In particular, the invention provides a recombinant simian adenoviral vector which encodes an antigen comprising the thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP), and also immunogenic compositions (e.g. vaccines) comprising the vector and methods of using such compositions .<br><br>
Background to the invention<br><br>
Malaria remains a major health problem in the world. It has been estimated that at least 3,000 million people, nearly half of the world' s population, are living in malaria endemic areas and between 300 and 500 million clinical cases and about 1.5 million deaths are reported annually [I]. The development of an effective vaccine would be an important achievement to help decrease the problem of this disease. The pre-erythrocytic vaccination approach has shown some efficacy in clinical trials with immunity to this stage of the malaria life cycle directed towards both the sporozoite and subsequent intrahepatic schizont [2] . The cellular immune response has previously been shown to be important in pre-erythrocytic immunity with CD8+ T cells and IFN? production playing a major role in protection against liver stage malaria [3] . <br><br>
The thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) is an antigen expressed on the sporozoites which has previously been shown to induce protective CD8+ T cell responses [4]. TRAP has been extensively tested in vaccine clinical trials as a fusion protein with a multiepitope string containing additional B-cell, CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes from several malaria antigens, known as ME. TRAP [5, 6] .<br><br>
Vaccine vectors based on plasmid DNA or modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) encoding the ME. TRAP antigen have been tested in the field (Moorthy et al. (2004) PLoS, Med 1(2): e33) and shown to induce high frequencies of effector T cells when used in a prime-boost regime.<br><br>
Nevertheless, there remains a need for improved antimalarial vaccines which are capable of preventing natural infection with Plasmodium falciparum in human subjects as well as inducing stronger T cell responses, particularly of the CD8+ type. In clinical trials of ME. TRAP as an insert in both DNA and poxvirus vectors, such as MVA and fowlpox, responses have been predominantly of the CD4+ type which are probably less protective than CD8+ T cell responses.<br><br>
Adenoviral vectors of the human serotype 5 have previously been used in a P. yoelii mouse model of malaria and have shown outstanding immunogenicity and significant protection after just a single dose [7]. However, one major limitation preventing the use of this serotype in humans is the ubiquitous presence of AdH5, with frequent childhood infections resulting in seroconversion. To circumvent the problem of pre-existing immunity to AdH5, there has been increased interest in the use of adenoviral serotypes of <br><br>
simian origin that do not circulate in human populations, with a number of studies demonstrating the ability of these vectors to elicit CD8+ T-cell responses in both mice and nonhuman primate models of SARS [8] and HIV [9, 10].<br><br>
Si"T"t»ary of the invention<br><br>
The present inventors have now shown that simian adenoviral vectors (particularly those derived from the chimpanzee adenovirus isolate AdCh63) encoding the ME. TRAP antigen can elicit outstanding CD8+ T-cell responses, as well as a high titer antibody response against TRAP, over a long period of time. Moreover, immunogenicity can be boosted by a subsequent administration of an MVA vector coding for the same transgene, and strong immunogenicity is observed in rhesus macaques, a species used as a good predictor of likely human immunogenicity. Immunogenicity has also been demonstrated in a Phase I human clinical study. Protective efficacy studied with the AdCh63 vector encoding ME. TRAP in a mouse challenge model was unexpectedly greater than with other adenoviral vectors. Efficacy in this mouse model is widely seen in- the field as being a useful and predictive indicator for humans.<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br><br>
In the following paragraphs the various aspects of the invention are described in further detail. Any feature described as preferred in connection with one aspect of the invention is also preferred in relation to other aspects of the invention unless otherwise stated.<br><br>
The present inventors have constructed simian adenovirus vectors which express a heterologous antigen comprising the pre-erythrocytic malarial (sporozoite) antigen thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) and have observed that such vectors are capable of eliciting strong CD8+ T cell responses in two different animal models. The level of T cell response elicited using simian adenoviral vector to express the TRAP antigen was unexpectedly high, particularly when tested in a primate model, indicating that the combination of simian adenoviral vector and TRAP antigen is particularly potent in eliciting immunity to this pre- erythrocytic malarial antigen.<br><br>
A major aspect of the invention is therefore the provision of a recombinant replication-defective simian adenoviral vector which encodes an antigen comprising TRAP or at least one epitope thereof (preferably at least one T cell epitope of TRAP) . The recombinant replication-defective simian adenoviral vector will typically comprise a simian adenovirus genome into which is stably integrated a transgene which encodes at least one antigen operably linked to regulatory sequences which direct expression of the transgene in mammalian cells, wherein the antigen comprises <br><br>
a thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) or at least one T cell epitope thereof.<br><br>
Adenoviral vectors, and specifically simian adenoviral vectors, are generally known in the art. A number of replication-defective recombinant simian adenoviruses are described in WO 2005/071093, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br><br>
The simian adenoviral vectors of the invention typically comprise a simian adenoviral genome which is modified by stable insertion of a transgene expression cassette which comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TRAP antigen operably linked to regulatory sequences which are capable of directing expression of the TRAP antigen in a mammalian cell.<br><br>
The recombinant simian adenoviral vectors of the invention are typically "replication defective", meaning that they have been rendered incapable of replication because of a functional deletion, or complete removal, of a gene encoding a gene product essential for viral replication. By way of example, the vectors of the invention may be rendered replication defective by removal of all or a part of the El gene, and optionally also the E3 region and/or the E4 region. The native E4 region of the simian adenovirus may be replaced by that of a human adenovirus, e.g. Ad5E4orf6. The general features of "replication-defective" simian adenoviral vectors are known in the art, for example from WO 2005/071093, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. <br><br>
In one particular, but non-limiting, embodiment the recombinant adenoviral vector of the invention may be based on the genome of the chimpanzee adenovirus isolate AdCh63. This particular viral serotype is known in the art (e.g. from WO 2005/071093) but has never before been described as a vaccine carrier for the pre-erythrocytic TRAP antigen of Plasmodium sp. The inventors have observed that the combination of the AdCh63 vector backbone expressing a TRAP antigen induces a spectacular CD8+ T cell response, and has the additional advantage of eliciting a strong TRAP-specific antibody (IgG) response.<br><br>
The vector of the invention may express a full length TRAP antigen, or a fragment thereof which comprises at least one T cell epitope. Typically the fragment comprising at least one T cell epitope will be at least nine amino acids in length, and may be any length up to the full length of TRAP or ME. TRAP. For example, the fragment may be in the range of from 9 to 200, or from 9 to 100, of from 9 to 50 amino acids in length. The positions of T cell epitopes within the TRAP sequence have been described previously in the literature and will be well known to persons skilled in the art. Example T cell epitopes of TRAP are described in the following publications: Aidoo M, Lalvani A, Allsopp CE, Plebanski M, Meisner SJ, Krausa P, Browning M, Morris-Jones S, Gotch F, Fidock DA, et al. Lancet. 1995; 345 : 1003-7; Flanagan KL, Plebanski M, Akinwunmi P, Lee EA, Reece WH, Robson KJ, Hill AV, Pinder M. Eur J Immunol. 1999 Jun; 29: 1943-54; and Flanagan KL, Plebanski M, Odhiambo K, Sheu E, Mwangi T,<br><br>
Gelder C, Hart K, Kortok M, Lowe B, Robson KJ, Marsh K, Hill AV. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2006 Mar; 74 (3) : 367-75, the contents <br><br>
of which documents are expressly incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of describing known T cell epitopes of TRAP.<br><br>
The TRAP antigen may be derived from any Plasmodium sp., but will typically be a TRAP antigen from a strain of Plasmodium falciparum. The TRAP antigen sequence may be from any Plasmodium falciparum strain, but in a particular (non- limiting) embodiment the TRAP antigen is from Plasmodium falciparum strain T9/96. The TRAP antigens of different strains of Plasmodium falciparum display a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (typically greater than 90% across the full length TRAP sequence) . Thus, it is contemplated to use any TRAP amino acid sequence which shares greater than 90%, greater than 95% or greater than 99% amino acid sequence identity with the TRAP antigen of Plasmodium falciparum strain T9/96.<br><br>
The TRAP antigen (or T cell epitope fragment thereof) may be expressed alone or in combination with additional polypeptide sequences, for example as a fusion protein. These additional polypeptide sequences may comprise B-cell, CD8+ T cell or CD4+ T cell epitopes, and specifically B-cell or T cell epitopes from Plasmodium falciparum antigens other than TRAP. A particularly advantageous combination is the construct denoted ME. TRAP, which comprises a full length TRAP antigen fused to a multiepitope string of B-cell, CD8+ T cell and CD4+ T cell epitopes from other pre-erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum antigens, (5,6). The ME. TRAP antigen described in the literature (and shown in SEQ ID NO: 2) contains the full length TRAP sequence taken from Plasmodium falciparum strain T9/96. However, it will be appreciated <br><br>
that the TRAP portion of this ME. TRAP construct may be replaced with TRAP sequences taken from other strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Skilled readers will also appreciate that the TRAP sequence (and/or the ME sequence) may be modified by one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions or deletions without substantially altering T cell (or B cell) immunogenicity.<br><br>
In one specific, non-limiting embodiment the ME. TRAP antigen may comprise or consist of the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 2. Other suitable TRAP antigen sequences are described by Robson KJ, et al. Nature. 1988; 335 : 79-82, incorporated herein by reference. The ME epitope string is described by Gilbert SC, et al., Nat Biotechnol. 1997; 15 (12) : 1280-4, incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The regulatory sequences directing expression of the TRAP antigen may include transcription initiation sequences, promoter sequences or enhancer sequences, and combinations thereof. The promoter sequence is typically a heterologous promoter (with respect to both the adenovirus and the expressed antigen) and can be any promoter which is recognised by eukaryotic RNA polymerase (e.g. RNA polll) .<br><br>
A preferred promoter is the immediate early (IEl) promoter of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) , which is described by Chapman et al. NAR, 19: 3979-3986, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. This promoter may be used in a "long" form which includes a fragment of the 51 untranslated region of the IEl gene comprising the intron A sequence, or in a "short" form which lacks the intron A sequence. The "long" CMV promoter is generally preferred and will <br><br>
typically exclude exon B. However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the use of the "long" HCMV promoter to direct expression of the TRAP antigen. Other heterologous promoters which direct a suitable level of expression of the antigen may be used, including promoters which expression levels substantially equivalent to those achieved using the HCMV "long" promoter. Suitable promoters include, for example, the murine CMV promoter, Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter, SV40 early/late promoters and the beta-actin promoter.<br><br>
The transgene expression cassette (encoding the antigen comprising TRAP) will typically also include a heterologous transcription terminator sequence. Any suitable RNApolII terminator sequence may be used, for example the BGH poly A sequence. The combination of HCMV "long" promoter and BGH polyA sequence is particularly advantageous and is preferred for use with the AdCh63 vector backbone.<br><br>
The transgene expression cassette (encoding the antigen comprising TRAP) will typically be inserted into the El- deleted region of the simian adenoviral genome. However, it should be understood that the precise location of the insertion site and the orientation of the transgene expression cassette in the vector are not critical provided that 1) the transgene expression cassette is functional, in the sense that it is capable of directing expression of the antigen comprising TRAP following insertion into the adenoviral genome and 2) insertion of the transgene does not prevent replication and/or packing of the adenoviral vector into infective viral particles in a suitable host cell line. <br><br>
The simian adenovirus vectors of the invention are typically supplied and used as infectious viral particles comprising the recombinant adenovirus genome encoding the TRAP antigen. Replication-defective adenoviruses can be grown in tissue culture to produce high titres of infectious viral particles, using cell lines that provide the missing gene products essential for viral replication and packaging in trans. The adenoviral backbone (genome) sequences may be cloned into bacterial plasmid vectors in order to facilitate cloning and manipulation using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Such plasmids represent "molecular clones" of the corresponding adenovirus vector, and contain the entire recombinant adenoviral genome. Following restriction enzyme digestion of the plasmid vector to remove bacterial sequences and expose the inverted terminal repeats, the resulting nucleic acid may be used to transfect a suitable host cell line which supplies the essential gene function deleted from the viral genome sequence (e.g. the El gene product), this generating pure recombinant virus particles. A suitable example is the cell line HEK 293, which supports the growth of El-deleted adenoviruses. Another suitable cell line is that called PerCß.<br><br>
Although the invention primarily relates to recombinant simian adenoviral particles which can be administered in immunogenic compositions, e.g. vaccines, it is to be understood that the corresponding plasmid vectors, which comprise the simian adenoviral backbone with a stably integrated TRAP (or ME. TRAP) expression cassette in plasmid vector form, also form part of the invention. Such plasmid vectors are useful in the production of high titer stocks of <br><br>
adenoviral particles comprising the recombinant adenovirus genome encoding the TRAP (or ME. TRAP) antigen.<br><br>
Immunogenic compositions<br><br>
The invention also provides immunogenic compositions comprising the simian adenovirus vector according to the first aspect of the invention. Such compositions typically comprise the simian adenovirus vector in the form of infective adenoviral particles admixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles, diluents, carriers or adjuvants .<br><br>
In one embodiment the composition may be a vaccine composition which is suitable for human administration and which can be used to elicit a protective immune response (such as by CD8+, often cytotoxic, T cells) against at least the TRAP antigen.<br><br>
The preferred features of the simian adenoviral vectors described in connection with the first aspect of the invention apply also to the compositions of the invention.<br><br>
The compositions of the invention will typically be formulated as liquid dosage forms comprising adenoviral particles in a suitable liquid carrier, for example an aqueous carrier such as 1OmM Histidine, 7.5%sucrose, 35mM NaCI, ImM MgCl2 , 0.1% PS80, 0. ImM EDTA, 0.5% ethanol, pH 6.6, endotoxin-free PBS or any other suitable carrier. Preferred dosage forms are formulated for intramuscular or intradermal administration, although other routes of administration, such as oral, intravenous, mucosal, <br><br>
transdermal etc. are not excluded. Immunogenic or vaccine compositions intended for human administration typically contain viral particles at a titre in the range of from 1-3 x 1011 vp/mL.<br><br>
Methods of eliciting immune response<br><br>
Compositions comprising the simian adenoviral vector of the invention may be administered to human subjects in order to elicit an immune response against the encoded TRAP antigen. The inventors have shown that vectors according to the invention (and in particular AdCh63 or AdC9 vectors encoding the ME. TRAP antigen) can elicit a strong CD8+ T cell response in animal models. In particular, the protective efficacy shown with the AdCh63 Vector encoding ME. TRAP in a mouse challenge model is quite unexpectedly greater than with other adenoviral vectors. Efficacy in this model is widely seen in the field as being a useful and predictive indicator for humans and thus the vaccine comprising AdCh63 encoding ME. TRAP will be useful in protecting humans against malaria. Indeed, the inventors have already demonstrated that an example vaccine comprising AdCh63 encoding ME. TRAP is immunogenic in humans.<br><br>
The invention therefore provides for administration of the compositions according to the invention (and in particular compositions comprising the AdCh63 vector encoding the ME. TRAP antigen) to human subjects in either a single immunization or as part of a broader dosing regimen, for example a prime-boost regime. <br><br>
The human subjects receiving immunisations with the simian adenoviral vectors of the invention may be any human subjects that it is desired to immunise against malaria.<br><br>
For single immunization regimes, subjects will typically receive a dose in the range of from 1 x 108 to 5 x 1010 viral particles. This dose will generally be administered intradermally, but other treatment regimes involving alternative dosages and routes of administration are not to be excluded.<br><br>
Prime-boost regimes will typically involve administration of a priming dose of recombinant simian adenovirus expressing the antigen comprising TRAP (and in particular ME. TRAP) at a first time point, followed by administration of a boosting dose of a non-adenoviral vector encoding an antigen comprising TRAP (or ME. TRAP) at a second time point. The first and second time points will be separated by at least two weeks, and typically by approximately 8 weeks.<br><br>
The non-adenoviral vector1 used to administer the boosting dose can be any non-adenoviral vector encoding an antigen comprising TRAP (or ME. TRAP) . Suitable examples include viral vectors, particularly recombinant pox virus vectors (e.g. MVA), and plasmid DNA vectors.<br><br>
A preferred (but non-limiting) combination utilises recombinant AdCh63 encoding the ME. TRAP antigen for the priming dose and MVA encoding ME. TRAP for the boosting dose (e.g. at a dose in the range of from IxIO7 to IxIO8 pfu) .<br><br>
In a preferred (but again non-limiting) regime, both doses <br><br>
are administered intradermally and the priming and boosting doses are separated by a period of 8 weeks.<br><br>
The T cells induced by the vaccine and vaccination regimes described herein may be useful for malaria prevention or treatment. But they also have other applications. They may be used to generate reagents of use in malaria diagnostics such as in the use of T cells to diagnose malaria infection. Or the T cells used may be of value in T cell transfer protocols for malaria immunotherapy. Also the ability of a n individual to generate a sufficient immune responses after vaccination may be used as a measure of immunocompetence, for the exclusion of specific immune or genetic defects.<br><br>
The invention will be further understood with reference to the following non-limiting experimental examples.<br><br>
Example 1<br><br>
Production of AdCh63ME . TRAP vector<br><br>
AdCh63 ME-TRAP is a replication defective simian adenoviral vector expressing ME-TRAP to be used for vaccination to prevent malaria.<br><br>
AdCh63 ME-TRAP, consists of the simian adenovirus, chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63, containing a sequence of genes which express a series of known cytotoxic T lymphocytes, (CTL) , epitopes from Plasmodium falciparum pre- erythrocytic stage antigens fused to a complete pre- <br><br>
erythrocytic stage antigen, Thrombospondin Related Adhesion Protein (TRAP) .<br><br>
The individual CTL epitopes which constitute the 'multiple epitope' part of ME-TRAP, represent a variety of potentially protective target antigens and are included to ensure an immune response to the vaccine in the majority of the population vaccinated. TRAP is an abundant pre- erythrocytic stage antigen. Human volunteers immunised with irradiated sporozoites and protected against malaria develop T cell responses against TRAP making it a strong candidate for inclusion in a malaria vaccine.<br><br>
The nucleotide sequence of the vaccine insert is shown as SEQ ID N0:l.<br><br>
Plasmid pChAd63 ME-TRAP was used as the starting material for AdCh63 ME-TRAP production. To produce this plasmid a ME-TRAP expression cassette was cloned into a linearised pre adeno-acceptor vector via homologous recombination.<br><br>
Construction of this plasmid is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.<br><br>
The plasmid pSG2 ME-TRAP (Fig. Ia) was cleaved with Afel and Sail to excise a 4.7Kb fragment containing the HCMV promoter, METRAP and BGHpolyA sequence.<br><br>
The resulting ME-TRAP 4.7 Kb fragment (Fig. Ib) which also contains the HCMV promoter, Intron A and the BGH polyA sequence was recombined into a preChAd63NSmut acceptor vector carrying the non structural region (NS) of hepatitis C virus under control of HCMV and BGHpA (Fig. Ic) . The <br><br>
pChAd63 vector is derived from the wild type Chimp Adenovirus 63 genome cloned in a plasmid vector carrying the following modifications in different regions of pChAd63 viral backbone:<br><br>
1) deletion of the El region (from bp 455 to bp 3421) of the viral genome<br><br>
2) deletion of the E3 region from bp 27207 to bp 31788<br><br>
3) deletion of the E4 region from bp 33834 to bp 36216 4) insertion of the Ad5E4orf6 from bp 33319 to bp34200<br><br>
The acceptor vector, ChAd63 (c) NSmut was linearised by cleaving with Hpal and Snabl. The ME-TRAP cassette was cloned in to the pre-adeno vector by homologous recombination in E.coli. BJ 5183 cells were co-transformed with ~30ng of linearised acceptor vector (?Hpal, ?SnabI) and -100 ng of digested pSG2 ME-TRAP (?Afel, ?Sall) . Recombination occurred between the 4.7 kb fragment and the pre adeno ChAd63NSmut acceptor vector resulting in the insertion of the 4.7kb fragment (containing the HCMV promoter, the ME-TRAP gene and the BGH polyA sequence) into the adenoviral vector, exploiting the homology existing between HCMV promoter and BGH polyA sequences. Positive clones were identified by restriction digestion analysis with HindIII and EcoRI .<br><br>
Figure Id is a map of the novel ChAd63 vector containing the ME-TRAP antigen. HindIII and EcoRI sites are shown. Confirmation of the identity of plasmid DNA was obtained by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. The expected Hindlll-EcoRI restriction enzyme profiles were observed on agarose gel electrophoresis for ME-TRAP containing <br><br>
fragments. Sequence analysis was performed with different oligos confirming that the sequence of the ME-TRAP insert was correct.<br><br>
Manufacture of the Primary Virus Stock, (PVS)<br><br>
Preparation of HEK 293 Cells<br><br>
I Linearisation of plasmid DNA j, transfection Initiating Adenovirus infection<br><br>
I Harvesting Adenovirus<br><br>
The Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line is a permanent line of primary human embryonal kidney transformed by sheared human adenovirus type 5 DNA. The cells are particularly sensitive to human adenoviruses and will support the growth of ElA deleted replication deficient adenoviruses. HEK 293 cells were obtained from Bio Reliance, Todd Campus, West of Scotland Science Park, Glasgow G20 OXA.<br><br>
The HEK 293 cell line was cultured as adherent cells. The cells were grown without antibiotics in DMEM supplemented with glutamine and 10% qualified foetal bovine serum, (FBS) in sterile conditions.<br><br>
To produce the PVS, log phase HEK 293 cells were transfected with 5 µg of Pmel linearised plasmid DNA using the cationic liposome transfection reagent chemically defined, <br><br>
Lipofectamine, 2000, from Invitrogen (18 hours post seeding) .<br><br>
The restriction enzyme Pmel and specific buffer were purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB) .. The BSA in this buffer was defined as of US origin. Four units of Pmel (10, 000U/mL) were used to linearise lµg of DNA. Sterile water was used for dilution. Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium, (DMEM) without foetal bovine serum, (FBS) was used for the transfection stage (the presence of FBS reduces the transfection efficiency) . The transfected cells were harvested on day 10 when maximum cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. The virus was harvested from the cells by three rounds of freeze thawing and pooled with the cell supernatant in 10% sterile glycerol with a final volume of<br><br>
4.1 mL. Vials of PVS were snap frozen and stored at -800C. A retest date of 6 months was assigned to this stock.<br><br>
Manufacture of Pre Working Vector Stock A single vial of HEK 293 cells was thawed and expanded in DMEM plus glutamine containing 10% FBS to generate after 5 passages, 2 Cellbind rollers of evenly dispersed adherent cells. On the day of infection, the cells in 1 roller were suspended using recombinant trypsin and counted. The cell density was 1.06 x 105 cells/cm2. The cells in the second roller were infected with primary virus stock at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.64 pfu/cell in 113 mL of inoculum. The required amount of stock virus (1.25 mL) was thawed on wet ice and diluted to 115 mL with cell culture medium, (DMEM plus glutamine and 2% FBS) . <br><br>
Roller bottles were rolled once manually then placed on a roller bank rotating at 0.1 rpm, in an incubator set at 370C, for 48 hours. The roller bottles were checked daily for the presence of CPE. Typical CPE is accompanied by rounding of the cells. The control cell cultures are checked for the absence of CPE.<br><br>
Virus-infected roller bottles were harvested after a single round of virus replication and with the appearance of total CPE (48 hours) . The virus-infected cells were gently resuspended in the culture medium to form a cell suspension which was then pelleted by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 2000 rpm at 200C. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 8.OmL of cell lysis buffer, (1OmM Tris, 135mM NaCl, ImM MgCl, pH 7.9 prepared in CBF purified water) . The cell pellet was then transferred to a 50 mL polypropylene tube. The cell pellet was subjected to three rounds of freeze thawing (frozen in an IPA/dry CO2 bath and then thawed in a 370C water bath) . The cell lysate was clarified by further centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant (cell lysate) was snap frozen at -800C in small aliquots. A sample was taken from the cell lysate for infectious titre (3.34 x 108 pfu/mL) . Samples of infected and uninfected cell supernatant (both 100 mL) were analysed for bioburden (both negative) .<br><br>
Manufacture of Working Vector Stocks (WVS) 1 and 2<br><br>
The pre working vector stock (pre WVS) was used to manufacture the working vector stock 1 (WVSl) and WSVl was used to manufacture WVS2. Both involved a single round of virus replication in HEK 293 cells evenly adherent in <br><br>
Cellbind roller bottles. The size of WVS2 is calculated such that a batch production lot uses =10% of total WVS2. For WVSl, 14 rollers of HEK 293 cells at a cell density of 1.29 x lOVcm2 were used for virus expansion and for WVS2, 29 rollers at a cell density of 1.54 x 105/cm2 were used. The manufacturing specification for both WVSl and WVS2 was the same. The viral inoculum (Pre WVS or WVSl respectively) was diluted with DMEM plus glutamine and 2% FBS to 113 mL /roller for WVSl and to 20 mL/roller for 2 hours then to 113 mL/roller final for WVS2. The final MOIs were 1.01 for WVSl and 8.6 pfu/cell for WVS2 respectively). Bottles were rolled once manually then placed on a roller bank at 0.1 rpm, at 37 0C for 48 and 71 hours respectively. The roller bottles were checked daily for the presence of CPE. A negative control roller containing uninfected HEK 293 cells was included in both procedures for comparison and for counting cells.<br><br>
WVSl was harvested 48 hours post infection whilst WVS2 was harvested at 71 hours post infection. Virus-infected cells were gently resuspended in the cell supernatant to form a cell suspension which was then decanted into centrifuge tubes and pelleted by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 2000 rpm at 200C. The cell supernatants were removed and each cell pellet resuspended in 8.OmL of cell lysis buffer, (1OmM Tris, 135mM NaCl, ImM MgCl, pH 7.9) per roller. The cell pellet suspensions were then pooled into polypropylene tubes. The tubes underwent three rounds of freeze thawing (frozen in an IPA/dry CO2 bath and then thawed in a 37°C water bath) . The resulting cell lysate was clarified by further centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C.<br><br>
The supernatant (cell lysate) containing the virus (WSVl or WSV2) was pooled, sampled, aliquoted and snap frozen at - <br><br>
8O0C. Final volumes of 112 mL and 236 mL for each stock were prepared.<br><br>
Manufacture of the Bulk Harvest Clinical Lot of AdCh63 ME- TRAP<br><br>
WVS 2 was used to manufacture three bulk harvest lots of AdCh63 ME-TRAP. Each lot consists of a single round of virus replication from WVS2. The procedure was similar to the manufacturing of the WVS2 as described above with an initial inoculation of 20 mL/roller for 2 hours followed by top up to a final volume of 113 mL/roller but had the addition of Benzonase after the first freeze/thaw cycle during cell lysis. The viral inoculum (WVS2) was diluted with DMEM containing 2% FBS and glutamine as previously described and was added into the HEK 293 roller bottles in 20 mL at an MOI of 2-3 pfu/cell) . Bottles were rolled once manually then placed on a roller bank rotating at 0.1 rpm, in an incubator at 37°C for 71 hours total. The roller bottles were checked daily for the presence of CPE and the virus-infected roller bottles were harvested after the appearance of total CPE. The virus-infected cells were gently resuspended in the culture medium to form a cell suspension. A 2.5 mL sample of the cell suspension and supernatant was removed from each roller and pooled. It was labelled as 'pre bulk harvest pool lot 1, 2 or 3. These ?bulk harvest' samples were taken for final pooling to generate bulk harvest sample for in process external testing of adventitious virus and for reverse transcriptase. The remaining suspension was then pelleted by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 2000 rpm at 200C. The supernatants were removed and each cell pellet was resuspended in 8. OmL of <br><br>
cell lysis buffer, (1OmM Tris, 135mM NaCl, ImM MgCl, pH 7.9). The cell pellet suspensions were then pooled and dispensed into polypropylene tubes. The tubes underwent one round of freeze thawing (frozen in an IPA/dry CO2 bath and then thawed in a 37°C water bath) . The minimum freeze time was 30 min. Benzonase was then added to degrade residual host cell DNA prior to purification (1500 units per 8mL cell lysate) . The cell lysate was incubated with Benzonase for 25-35 minutes at 20 'C ± 2°C on a gyro rocker set at full speed after which a further two rounds of freeze thawing took place as previously described. The cell lysate was clarified by further centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. The cell lysate supernatant was removed using a sterile pipette to measure the volume pooled, aliquoted and snap frozen at -800C.<br><br>

Adenovirus particles have a distinct density in cesium chloride (CsCl) allowing their purification from the majority of contaminating viral and host cell proteins and DNA by density gradient ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Optima ultra centrifuge. Viral particles lacking packaged DNA (empty capsids) can be separated from complete virions as they have a lower density. Typically, following step gradient ultra-centrifugation a lower band of ^infectious' viral particles is seen with a band above it containing empty capsids. The harvest from the first step gradient is further purified by equilibrium CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation for 2Oh. Purification lot size was constrained by the volume of bulk harvest that the centrifuge tubes and rotor (Beckman SW40) could hold. The size of the bulk harvest lot aliquots had been chosen such that the volume was suitable for transfer to this process and an appropriate volume of bulk harvest was thawed at the start of each purification lot. The virus harvest from between 1 and 2 preliminary step gradient centrifugation runs was used as the starting material for the second equilibrium centrifugation step. Thus the purification of the bulk harvest lots was performed in a series of repetitive sanitary processes. In total an initial small lot (for toxicity and stability studies) and 10 purification lots were prepared from the 3 bulk harvest lots.<br><br>
Discontinuous CsCl ultracentrifugation<br><br>
A step gradient was prepared manually in 14 mL Ultraclear centrifuge tubes (Beckman) using 3 different densities of CsCl. The cesium chloride solutions were prepared in 10 mM Tris pH7.9 in CBF purified water. Initially 2mL of 1.25 g/L CsCl solution was added to each tube and underlayered with 2 <br><br>
mL of 1.35 g/L CsCl. Finally the solution of greatest density of CsCl (0.5mL of 1.50 CsCl) was underlayered. Step gradients were prepared using chilled solutions within 1 hour of use.<br><br>
Individual samples of bulk harvest lot cell lysate were thawed in cold water (4 - 10°C) . Approximately 8.5 mL of cell lysate was manually layered on top of the CsCl gradient. The tubes were promptly (
<br>
Equilibrium CsCl ultracentrifugation Identical centrifuge tubes were used to perform equilibrium ultracentrifugation. These were initially filled with 6 mL of a CsCl density of 1.35 and overlayered with 1.0 - 1.5 mL of the virus pool harvested from the first ultracentrifugation steps. The top up buffer was phosphate buffered saline prepared in water for injection. The virus was centrifuged at 150,000 g for 20 hours at 100C. This resulted in a diffuse faint upper band and a lower sharp band of intact virus particles. Two faint bands either side of the sharp band could also be visualised. The main sharp band of infectious virus particles was harvested using either a 16G horizontal needle and syringe as before. Between 0.5 and 1.OmL of virus was harvested per tube and <br><br>
stored at 4-100C in a cold box for a maximum of 2 hours before final formulation by buffer exchange.<br><br>
Formulation into final buffer The CsCl purified pool of virus was buffer exchanged into final formulation buffer (A438) via chromatographic desalting on Sephadex G25 using disposable polypropylene ready poured PD-IO columns containing 8.3 mL of Sephadex G25 in water containing 0.15% Kathon as a biocide (Amersham Biosciences division of GE Healthcare) . Conditions for a water wash of 6 column volumes prior to sanitisation were established that removed &gt;99.5% of Kathon from the column eluate.<br><br>
After washing, the columns were then sanitised for a minimum 20 minutes with 0.5M sodium hydroxide and five column volumes of phosphate buffered saline were used to neutralise the sodium hydroxide. The columns were finally washed into formulation buffer: (3 column volumes) Formulation buffer (A438) : 1OmM Histidene, 35 mM NaCl, ImM MgCl. 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) ethanol, 7.5% sucrose, 0.1% PS80 pH 6.6 was prepared using water for injection. Conditions were established for the virus sample (61ogs below the weight adjusted equivalent to the rat LD50 for subcutaneous caesium chloride injection. A series of columns (£5) were used to buffer exchange each purification lot such that the specified volumes could be applied and collected. The virus peak was collected as a single fraction from each column and the fractions were pooled to generate a concentrated purification lot. From a QC virus particle <br><br>
determination, the lot was diluted with ice cold A438 to between 2-3 x 1011 vp/mL and filtered through a 0.45 micron filter (Millipore Millex HV 33 mm diameter PVDF disc filter) to remove large virus aggregates. Each purification lot was snap frozen in isopropyl alcohol/dry ice and stored at - 80°C. The maximum hold time was 1 hour post formulation.<br><br>
The final dosage form is presented in glass vials of 0.6 mL. Each vial of AdCh63 ME-TRAP contains 1.3 x 1011 vp / mL formulated in 1OmM Histidine, 7.5%sucrose, 35mM NaCI, ImM MgCl2 , 0.1% PS80, 0. ImM EDTA, 0.5% ethanol, pH 6.6. (This titre was determined by absorbance at 260nm) . The dose of AdCh63 ME-TRAP to be used is typically between 1 x 108 vp and 5 x 1010 vp by intradermal administration. The volume administered may alter, corresponding to any updated concentration.<br><br>

Materials and methods<br><br>
Immunization of mice<br><br>
Female BALB/c mice 6 to 8 week of age were purchased from the Biomedical Services Unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford with all animals undertaken in accordance with the terms of the U.K. Home Office Animals Act Project License. Immunizations were performed intradermally, which has previously been shown to elicit better immunogenicity when compared to other routes e.g. sub-cutaneous, intramuscular [11] . Adenoviruses were administered at a dose of IxIO10 viral particles (v.p.) for experiments involving a single <br><br>
prime and lower doses of 5xlO9 vp for prime-boost protocols. MVA was used at a dose of IxIO7 pfu for boosting the T-cell responses. All vectors were resuspended in endotoxin-free PBS prior to immunization.<br><br>
Immunization and analysis of T-cell responses in macaques Rhesus macaques were immunized by two different routes, intramuscular injection in deltoid muscles (macaque id numbers: 0033, 1029, 2013 and 4073) and intradermal administration (id numbers: 0043, 2009 and 6015) of AdCh63 ME. TRAP at a dose of 5xlO10 v.p. All macaques were given a boost by intradermal immunisation 8 weeks later with MVA ME. TRAP at a dose of 2xlO8 pfu.<br><br>
An ex-vivo IFN? ELISpot was performed by stimulating the T cells with 4 peptide pools spanning the whole region of ME. TRAP. Total responses to TRAP were calculated by adding responses to individual pools and subtracting a background value of non-stimulated samples that only contained DMSO.<br><br>
Viral vectors<br><br>
All viral vectors used in the experiments, AdCh63, AdC9 and MVA, express the transgene ME. TRAP that has been previously described [5, 12] . As described elsewhere herein, insert ME. TRAP is a hybrid transgene of 2398 bp encoding a protein of 789 amino acids. The ME string contains the BALB/c H-2Kd epitope Pb9 amongst a number of other B- and T-cell epitopes [13] . The simian adenoviral vector AdC9 (SAdV) was constructed and propagated as described previously [14].<br><br>
Manufacture and vector production for AdCh63 ME. TRAP was carried out as described in Example 1. AdCh63 has been <br><br>
successfully produced in good titres using this protocol and a similar protocol may be used to product ME. TRAP vectors based on alternative simian adenoviral vector backbones.<br><br>
Ex vivo IFN? ELISPOT<br><br>
ACK-treated splenocytes or PBMCs were cultured for 18-20 hours on IPVH-membrane plates (Millipore) with the immunodominant H-2Kd-restricted epitope Pb9 (SYIPSAEKI) at a final concentration of Iµg/ml. ELISPOT was performed as previously described [15] .<br><br>
ELISA<br><br>
IgG antibodies against the TRAP region were analyzed by ELISA as described previously [16] . For this experiment, serum was obtained from groups of at least 3 BALB/c mice after 4 weeks of immunization with adenovirus-MVA prime- boost regimes.<br><br>
Parasite challenge Plasmodium berghei (ANKA strain clone 234) sporozoites (spz) were isolated from salivary glands of female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Parasites were resuspended in RPMI- 1640 medium with each mouse receiving a total of 1,000 spz via the i.v. route. Blood samples were taken on daily basis from day 5 to 20; smears were stained with Giemsa and screened for the presence of schizonts within the red blood cells. Survival was defined as complete absence of parasites in blood.<br><br>
Statistical analysis<br><br>
Statistical significance of flow cytometry samples were analyzed with either a one or two-way ANOVA and a Bonferroni <br><br>
post-test. All statistic tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego California, USA, www.graphpad.com.<br><br>
RESULTS<br><br>
Immunogenicity upon a single prime of AdCh63ME .TRAP in mice<br><br>
Upon a single immunization, adenoviral vectors were able to induce strong, long-term CD8+ T cell responses. Figure 2 shows a comparison between AdCh63 and AdC9 both coding for the ME. TRAP transgene. The presence of the immunodominant H- 2Kd-restricted epitope Pb9 (SYIPSAEKI) in the ME string of the transgene allowed us to assess the potency of the immune response elicited by the viral vectors. Results in our lab have shown that AdC9 is one of the most immunogenic vectors and is able to induce CD8+ T-cell responses that outperform the human serotype AdH5. Figure 2 shows that AdCh63ME. TRAP induces similar responses to AdC9 over a period of time of 60 days. AdCh63 CD8 responses were significantly higher than AdC9 early after 7 days of vaccination and no significant differences were found afterwards. An important goal of any viral-vectored vaccine is the possibility to induce strong memory CD8+ T-cell responses and in that aspect both vectors, AdC9 and AdCh63 ME. TRAP showed similar immunogenicity even after a long period of time of 60 days.<br><br>
Protection to a challenge with Plasmodium berghei in mice<br><br>
The results of this study have shown for the first time that a single vaccination with adenoviral vectors can elicit high <br><br>
levels of sterile protection to malaria upon a challenge with P. berghei sporozoites. Initial experiments have shown that vectors such as AdH5, AdC7 and AdC9 are able to protect a high percentage of mice after only one vaccination (at doses of IxIO10 v.p) . Figure 3 shows a comparison of protective levels of AdCh63ME. TRAP with AdC9 shortly after immunization on day 14 (a) and after a long period of time of 60 days (b) between the vaccine administration and the challenge. Despite similar immunogenicity by both vectors over the time (Fig 2), protective levels elicited by AdCh63 ME. TRAP outperformed AdC9 at both time points. Of particular importance, we found that upon a challenge at day 14 post- vaccination, AdCh63 protected all mice against infection for 15 days and at the end of the experiment only 1 mouse out of 6 was infected. AdC9 showed lower levels of protection on the short (Fig 3a) and long (Fig 3b) term.<br><br>

It has been reported that priming with AdH5 followed by a boost with MVA (A-M regimes) coding for the same transgene, increases immunogenicity when compared to a single administration of a vector or to prime-boost regimes with other vectors such as DNA or FP9 followed by MVA [11] . We have therefore tested an approach using prime-boost regimes combining a simian adenoviral vector followed 8 weeks later by the poxviral vector MVA. Figure 4 shows a comparison between CD8+ T-cell responses (Fig 4a, b) and antibody responses (Fig 4c) elicited by AdCh63-MVA and AdC9- MVA regimes. Shortly after immunization (Fig 4a), AdCh63 showed high levels of CD8 responses, and although AdC9 <br><br>
responses were more potent, no statistical differences were found. Analysis of the responses on the long term showed the great advantage of a prime-boost regime over a single prime. As shown in figure 4b, the CD8 responses remained high even at day 60 post-boost (&gt;25,000 SFC/million PBMCs) and contrasted with the levels at the same time point upon a single vaccination (
<br>
Although protection efficacy relies on the cellular immune responses in this system, adenoviral vectors offer the additional advantage of inducing strong transgene-specific antibody responses [17]. This feature is potentially important when the adenoviral vectors are used for vaccine purposes in humans due to the extra protection that antibodies provide in addition to the cellular immune responses. Humoral responses were assessed by quantifying the IgG elicited by A-M prime-boost regimes. As shown in figure 4c, antibody responses were high for both regimes tested and the use of an AdCh63-MVA combination resulted in significantly higher IgG levels compared to AdC9.<br><br>
Since the immunogenicity levels were improved by prime-boost regimes, the levels of sterile protection were analyzed using the same strategy of sequential vaccination (Fig 5) . Outstanding levels were found at short and long intervals after the boost in both regimes. However, the AdCh63-MVA regime outperformed the AdC9-MVA at all time points tested. Of interest, the AdCh63-MVA regime elicited sterile <br><br>
protection in 100% of the animals on the short term. Despite the protection decreasing with the time, it remained high and strikingly both regimes induced outstanding levels of protection even six months after the boosting vaccination (fig 5c) .<br><br>
Immunogenicity in Rhesus macaques<br><br>
In many prior art examples, the efficacy of vectored vaccines is observed to decrease when tested in nonhuman primates or humans, as compared to responses in mice. Therefore, a prime-boost regime similar to the one described above in mice was tested in Rhesus macaques.<br><br>
Seven rhesus macaques were immunised with a dose of 5 x 1010 vp of AdCh63 ME. TRAP vaccine prepared according to example 1. The vaccine was administered either intradermally or intramuscularly, but as no difference in immunogenicity was observed between the routes the combined data are shown. At various times after immunisation with AdCh63 ME-TRAP booster immunisations with a heterologous viral vector, MVA encoding ME-TRAP, were administered (see figure 7). The data show (figure 8) that AdCh63 ME-TRAP was highly immunogenic in macaque monkeys, a species widely regarded as usefully predictive of vaccine immunogenicity in humans. After a single immunisation mean T cell responses were observed of about 1000 SFU per million PBMCs in ELISPOT assays, a level previously associated with protection in humans for this vaccine insert (Webster et al. PNAS 2005 102:4836-41). Also strong antibody titres with induced by vaccination.<br><br>
Heterologous booster immunisations with MVA could boost both the T cell and antibody responses to even higher levels. <br><br>
Limited analysis of the phenotype of T cells from selected time points showed that both CD8 and CD4 T cells were induced by the vaccination regimes and that these could be polyfunctional cells that express interferon-gamma, TNF and IL2.<br><br>
As shown in figure ßa, priming with AdCh63ME. TRAP elicited robust T-cell responses that peaked at week 4 after vaccination. Of interest, all macaques but one (4073) were juveniles that weighed between 3-4 kg, whereas the older and heavier animal no. 4073 (more than 10kg) showed exceptionally good immune responses upon priming. Importantly, the T-cell responses could be boosted by a subsequent vaccination with MVA ME. TRAP and up to five-fold differences were found in some cases when comparing the peak of a prime versus the peak after a boost. Additional observations were made after comparing the immune responses to peptide pools that span the complete ME. TRAP region. The T-cell responses were mainly focused to the pool T2 after the AdCh63 prime (figure 6b) . However, the MVA boost gave the additional advantage of an increased breadth in the immune response to ME. TRAP, where the main focus was not only T2 but also towards the complete ME. TRAP sequence (figure 6c) . Importantly, these strong T cell responses induced in macaques are probably the strongest ever induced to a malaria antigen and are much higher than the T cell responses induced to ME. TRAP by any clinical trial undertaken to date. Because the magnitude of the T cell responses induced to TRAP has been correlated with the amount of protection measured in human clinical trials<br><br>
(Webster et al. PNAS; Dunachie et al Infection and Immunity) <br><br>
we anticipate that this vaccine regime should be more effective than any ME. TRAP vaccine tested to date in humans.<br><br>
Use of AdCh63 ME. TRAP in humans<br><br>
The simian adenoviral vector AdCh63 ME. TRAP has been evaluated in a phase I human clinical trial to test safety and immunogenicity in humans by a single immunization of AdCh63 ME. TRAP and a prime-boost regime involving the previous adenovirus followed by an MVA boost 8 weeks later.<br><br>
All volunteers recruited were healthy male adults. As this was the first time a chimpanzee adenovirus vector had been assessed in humans the first group of vaccinees received a very low dose of vaccine, 108 vp. This may be contrasted with the 5xlO10 vp dose administered to macaques and 1-10 x 1010 vp was used a typical dose in previous vaccine trials of human adenovirus vectors. At this low dose of 108 vp both local and systemic safety in the first eight volunteers was excellent. Four of these individuals received a booster immunisation with MVA encoding ME-TRAP at a dose of 2 x 108 pfu. The time course of T cell immunogenicity in these four volunteers is shown, as an average response in figure 9. Immunogenicity was measured by ex vivo gamma-interferon ELISPOT to 15 mer peptide pools overlapping the vaccine insert: T9/96 TRAP 15 mer, and also to the same sequence with overlapping 20mer peptides: T9/96 TRAP 20mer. Also shown is the response to 20mer peptides representing a heterologous strain of P. falciparum: 3D7 TRAP 20mer. Finally, the response to the short string of mainly nonamer malaria peptide epitopes in the ME-polyepitope string <br><br>
(Gilbert et al. Nature Biotechnol. 1997 Nov; 15 : 1280-4 ) is shown: ME.<br><br>
These results show that even at the very low dosage used detectable T cell responses to TRAP are observed at four weeks after a single immunisation with AdCh63 ME-TRAP in humans. Additionally these responses can be strongly- boosted by the MVA vaccine indicating that memory T cells are primed in humans by the adenoviral vector.<br><br>
