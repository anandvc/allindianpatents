				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a medicament for use in the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. avium and M. marinum.<br>
Tuberculosis is still a major public health problem affecting nearly all parts of the world. Based on skin test reactivity it has been estimated that about one-third of the world"s population, i.e., 1.7 billion people, are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite the availability of effective chemotherapies, it is responsible for three million deaths and fiom eight to ten million new cases annually and thus remains the leading cause of death world-wide due to a single infectious agent; 26% of all preventable deaths, J% of all deaths. According to the World Health Organisation, 450,000 deaths per year due to tuberculosis in developing countries occur in children under fifteen years of age, and the disease mostly affects the younger, more productive adults.<br>
There are five fiont-line drugs known to be highly effective against M. tuberculosis and five second-line drugs that can be used when resistance to one or more of the front-line drugs is detected. The preferred mode of treatment for tuberculosis is the short course chemother^y in which there are two phases. The fu^t phase consists of a daily regimen for two months with isoniazid (300 mg), rifampicin (600 mg), pyrazinamide (3 g) and ethambutol {1.5 g). The second ptwse or the continuation ph^e consiate of a daily regimen for the next four months with isoniazid and rifampicin. Although infection with drug-sensitive strains of M. tuberculosis can be effectively cured with the short course chemotherapy, the cure rate is very poor in most countries due to poor compliance, which is reflective of the long duration of therapy.<br>
The situation is further complicated by the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains. For example, in certain populations, the incidence of resistance to isoniazid is as high as 26% and the resistance to rifampicin is about 15%. Prior to 1984, about 10% of tubercle bacilli isolated fiom patients in the United States were<br><br>
resistant to at least one single mycobacterial drug. By 1984, this figure had risen to 52%, of which over half (32%) were resistant to more than one drug (MDR-TB). Ten percent of the recorded MDR-TB cases have occurred in previously healthy people whose mortality rate - 70 to 90% - has been nearly tiie same as that of jmrnunosuppressed individuals with MDR-TB. TTie number of cases of MDR-TB has doubled since 1984 and in many of them the tubercle bacilli are resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. The median interval between diagnosis of MDR-TB and death is only four weeks and therefore MDR-TB demands a shorter response time between dia^osis and appropriate commencement of treatment. However, MDR-TB is difficult to treat as such since most patients do not respond very well to the second-line drugs and the cost of alternate treatment procedures, including hospitalisation and possibly surgery, increases the cost to as much as ten times the cost of traditional treatment.<br>
Thus, there is an urgent medical need to identify new drugs with significant therapeutic activity against single- or multiple-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and with pluirmacokiuetic properties that permit reduced dosing which will in tum encourage better compliance.<br><br><br>

The compounds of fonnula (I) are known compounds or may be preparwi using techniques conventional in the art. The compoimds of formula (0 may, if desired, be converted to a phannaceutically-acceptable salt or solvate thereof, preferably an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fiimarate, maleate, tartrate, citrate, oxalate, methanesulphonate oip-toluenesulphonate, or an alkali metal salt such as a sodium or potassium salt.<br>
Certain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms. It will be understood that the invention encompasses all geometric and optical isomers of the confounds of fonnula (!) and mixtures thereof including racemates. Tautomers and mixtures thereof also form an aspect of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of fonnula (I) are advantageous in that they possess bactericidal activity against mycobacteria, particularly pathogenic mycobacteria such Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis. M. avium and M. marinum.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a patient suffering frran, or at risk of, a mycobacterial disease, which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amoimt of a compound of formula (I), or a phannaceutically-acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and phannaceutically-acceptable salts and solvates thereof may be used on their own but will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the formula (I) compoimd/salt/solvaie (active ingredient) is in association with a phannaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or cairier. Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99 %w (per cent by wei^t), more preferably from 0.10 to 70 %w.<br><br>
of active ingredient, and, fix&gt;m 1 to 99.95 %w, more preferably from 30 to 99.90 %w, of a pharmaceuticaliy-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier, all percentages by weight being based on total composition. The pharmaceutical composition may additionalVy contain another anti-tubercular agent and/or various other ingredients known in the art, for example, a lubricant, stabilising agent, buffering agent, emulsifying agent, viscosity-regulating agent, surfactant, preservative, flavoring or colorant.<br>
The daily dosage of formula (I) compound administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and ttie mycobacteria] disease indicated. However, in general, satisfactory results will be obtained when the compound of formula (!) is administCTed at a daily dosage not exceeding 1 g, e.g. in the range from 10 to 50 mg^g body weight.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be administered systemically, e.g. by oral administration in the form of tablets, c^sules, syrups, powders or granules, or by parenteral administration in the form of solutions or suspensions.<br>

Example 46<br>
Each of the compounds of Examples 1 to 45 was assessed for bactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis by measuring its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the "BACTEC" (trade mark) system developed by Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, U.S.A., which is based on a radiometric principle whereby carbon dioxide released by the catabolism of C-palmitate is spectrophotometrically detected and quantitated in arbitrary units of measurement referred to as growth index (GI) units.<br>
Thus, "BACTEC" vials were inoculated with 0.1 ml of M. tuberculosis (final bacterial concentration, 1 x 10^ colony forming units per ml) and 0.1 ml oftest compound in a range of concentrations. GI values were monitored until a value of ^ 30 was achieved for the 1:100 dilution control.<br>
For the purpose of this test, MIC is defined as the minimum concentration of test compound that effects a &gt;95% inhibition of the culture in comparison to the undiluted control, when the control reaches a GI value of 999.<br>
Endpoint determination (&gt;99% inhibition) is based on a conventional t % resistance cutHDfF, wherein the organism is considered resistant to a particular concentration of test compound if growth of greater than 1 % of the bacterial population is observed. Thus, a comparison is made between growth of the organism in the presence of a pre¬determined concentration oftest compound and growth of the same organism diluted 1:100 in the absence of any test con^round. The change in the GI values (AGI)isused to determine the endpoint susceptibility of the organism to the test compound. If the AGI of the 1:100 control isgreata-thanthe AGI in the presence of the test compound, then the concentration of test con^und used is considered to be bactericidal (&gt;99% inhibition) for the organism.<br><br>
The MIC of the compounds of Examples 1 to 46 were determined for the following strains of M. tuberculosis:<br>
H37RV,<br>
H37Ra,<br>
1 clinical isolate susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin [E: 22/95; Estonia],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isomazid [H: 997/94; Honduras], 1 clinical isolate resistant to isoniazid and ethambutol [E:5/94; Estonia],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isomazid and rifampicin [H: 44/95; Honduras],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isomazid and streptomycin [S: 150/96; Sweden],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin [AA:063; Ethiopia],<br>
3 clinical isolates resistant to isoniazid,    rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol [P:24/95;<br>
Estonia, S: 39/95; Nepal, S:42/95; China, H: 1005/94; Honduras],<br>
and were found in all cases to be less than or equal to 20 fig/ml. Therefore, the compounds of Examples 1 to 46 demonstrate effective bactericidal activity against the above strains of M. tuberculosis which include single- and multiple-drug resistant strains.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a medicament for use in the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. avium and M. murium.<br>
Tuberculosis is still a major public health problem affecting nearly all parts of the world. Based on skin test reactivity it has been estimated that about one-third of the world"s population, i.e., 1.7 billion people, are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite the availability of effective chemotherapies, it is responsible for three million deaths and from eight to ten million new cases annually and thus remains the leading cause of death world-wide due to a single infectious agent; 26% of all preventable deaths, J% of all deaths. According to the World Health Organisation, 450,000 deaths per year due to tuberculosis in developing countries occur in children under fifteen years of age, and the disease mostly affects the younger, more productive adults.<br>
There are five front-line drugs known to be highly effective against M. tuberculosis and five second-line drugs that can be used when resistance to one or more of the front-line drugs is detected. The preferred mode of treatment for tuberculosis is the short course chemotherapy in which there are two phases. The first phase consists of a daily regimen for two months with isoniazid (300 mg), rifampin (600 mg), pyrazinamide (3 g) and ethambutol {1.5 g). The second phase or the continuation phase consists of a daily regimen for the next four months with isoniazid and rifampin. Although infection with drug-sensitive strains of M. tuberculosis can be effectively cured with the short course chemotherapy, the cure rate is very poor in most countries due to poor compliance, which is reflective of the long duration of therapy.<br>
The situation is further complicated by the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains. For example, in certain populations, the incidence of resistance to isoniazid is as high as 26% and the resistance to rifampin is about 15%. Prior to 1984, about 10% of tubercle bacilli isolated from patients in the United States were<br><br>
resistant to at least one single mycobacterial drug. By 1984, this figure had risen to 52%, of which over half (32%) were resistant to more than one drug (MDR-TB). Ten percent of the recorded MDR-TB cases have occurred in previously healthy people whose mortality rate - 70 to 90% - has been nearly the same as that of imrnunosuppressed individuals with MDR-TB. The number of cases of MDR-TB has doubled since 1984 and in many of them the tubercle bacilli are resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. The median interval between diagnosis of MDR-TB and death is only four weeks and therefore MDR-TB demands a shorter response time between diagnosis and appropriate commencement of treatment. However, MDR-TB is difficult to treat as such since most patients do not respond very well to the second-line drugs and the cost of alternate treatment procedures, including hospitalisation and possibly surgery, increases the cost to as much as ten times the cost of traditional treatment.<br>
Thus, there is an urgent medical need to identify new drugs with significant therapeutic activity against single- or multiple-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and with pharmacokinetic properties that permit reduced dosing which will in turn encourage better compliance.<br>

Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99 %w (per cent by wei^t), more preferably from 0.10 to 70 %w.<br><br>
of active ingredient, and, fix&gt;m 1 to 99.95 %w, more preferably from 30 to 99.90 %w, of a pharmaceuticaliy-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier, all percentages by weight being based on total composition. The pharmaceutical composition may additionally contain another anti-tubercular agent and/or various other ingredients known in the art, for example, a lubricant, stabilising agent, buffering agent, emulsifying agent, viscosity-regulating agent, surfactant, preservative, flavoring or colorant.<br>
The daily dosage of formula (I) compound administered will, of course, vary with the compoimd employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and ttie mycobacteria] disease indicated. However, in general, satisfactory results will be obtained when the compoimd of formula (!) is administCTed at a daily dosage not exceeding 1 g, e.g. in the range from 10 to 50 mg^g body weight.<br>
The compounds of fonnula (I) may be administered systemically, e.g. by oral administration in the form of tablets, c^sixles, syrups, powders or grannies, or by parenteral administration in the form of solutions or suspensions.<br>

Example 46<br>
Each of the compounds of Examples 1 to 45 was assessed for bactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis by measuring its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the "BACTEC" (trade mark) system developed by Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, U.S.A., which is based on a radiometric principle whereby carbon dioxide released by the catabolism of C-palmitate is spectrophotometrically detected and quantitated in arbitrary units of measurement referred to as growth index (GI) units.<br>
Thus, "BACTEC" vials were inoculated with 0.1 ml of M. tuberculosis (final bacterial concentration, 1 x 10^ colony forming units per ml) and 0.1 ml oftest compound in a range of concentrations. GI values were monitored until a value of ^ 30 was achieved for the 1:100 dilution control.<br>
For the purpose of this test, MIC is defined as the minimum concentration of test compound that effects a &gt;95% inhibition of the culture in comparison to the undiluted control, when the control reaches a GI value of 999.<br>
Endpoint determination (&gt;99% inhibition) is based on a conventional t % resistance cutHDfF, wherein the organism is considered resistant to a particular concentration of test compound if growth of greater than 1 % of the bacterial population is observed. Thus, a comparison is made between growth of the organism in the presence of a pre¬determined concentration oftest compound and growth of the same organism diluted 1:100 in the absence of any test con^round. The change in the GI values (AGI)isused to determine the endpoint susceptibility of the organism to the test compound. If the AGI of the 1:100 control isgreata-thanthe AGI in the presence of the test compound, then the concentration of test con^und used is considered to be bactericidal (&gt;99% inhibition) for the organism.<br><br>
The MIC of the compounds of Examples 1 to 46 were determined for the following strains of M. tuberculosis:<br>
H37RV,<br>
H37Ra,<br>
1 clinical isolate susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin [E: 22/95; Estonia],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isomazid [H: 997/94; Honduras], 1 clinical isolate resistant to isoniazid and ethambutol [E:5/94; Estonia],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isomazid and rifampicin [H: 44/95; Honduras],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isomazid and streptomycin [S: 150/96; Sweden],<br>
1 clinical isolate resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin and streptomycin [AA:063; Ethiopia],<br>
3 clinical isolates resistant to isoniazid,    rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol [P:24/95;<br>
Estonia, S: 39/95; Nepal, S:42/95; China, H: 1005/94; Honduras],<br>
