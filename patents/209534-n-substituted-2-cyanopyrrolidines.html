Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease which cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from a peptide chain containing, preferably, a proline residue in the penultimate position. Although the biological role of DPP-IV in mammalian systems has not been completely established, it is believed to play an important role in neuropeptide metabolism, T-cell activation, attachment of cancer cells to the endothelium and the entry of HIV into lymphoid cells. DPP-IV is responsible for inactivating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). More particularly, DPP-IV cleaves the amino-terminal His-Ala dipeptide of GLP-1, generating a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, and thereby shortens the physiological response to GLP-1. Since the half-life for DPP-IV cleavage is much shorter than the half-life for removal of GLP-1 from circulation, a significant increase in GLP-1 bioactivity (5- to 10-fold) is anticipated from DPP-IV inhibition. Since GLP-1 is a major stimulator of pancreatic insulin secretion and has direct beneficial effects on glucose disposal, DPP-IV inhibition appears to represent an attractive approach for treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM),<br>
Although a number of DPP-IV inhibitors have been described, all have limitations relating to potency, stability or toxicity. Accordingly, a great need exists for novel DPP-IV inhibitors which are useful in treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV inhibition and which do not suffer from the above-mentioned limitations.<br><br>

The following Examples illustrate the invention. All temperatures are in degrees<br>
Celsius.<br>
■ i	'	;<br>
Example 1; l-f2-r(5-ChloroDvridin-2-vl)amino1ethvlamino1acetvl"2-cvano-(S)-pvrrolidine<br>
To a 500 ml flask is added 16.6 g of 2-[(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)amino]ethylamine and 100 ml of tetrattydrofuran and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath. To the cooled mixture is added 7.0 g of (2-cyanopyrrolidino)carbonylmethylene-(S)-bromide dissolved in 30 mjxrf tetrahydrofuran. The resultant mixture is stirred for 2 hours at 0°, the solvent is removed by rotovaping and the mixture is partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The product is then extracted into the ethyl acetate layer and the aqueous layer is then washed twice with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed successively with water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to obtain the desired free base compound in crude form. The crude form is then purified on silica gel employing a mixture of 5% methanol in methylene chloride as the eluent to yield the title compound in free base form as a light brown oil.<br>
After dissolving the free base in 30 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran, hydrogen chloride g£s is bubbled into the solution for five seconds. The off-white precipitate that forms is filtered, *   washed with dry tetrahydrofuran and the solvent is removed by high vacuum pumping to obtain the title compound in dihydrochloride acid addition salt form (off-white solid; m.p. 265°-267°; NMR: see * at bottom of Table hereunder).<br>
The starting material is obtained as follows: a) 22.37 g of (S)-2-carbamoylpyrrolidine, 30.1 ml of triethylamine and 30.0 mg of dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) are dissolved in 200 ml of methylene chloride and the solution is then added, dropwise, to an ice-cold solution of 18.8 ml of bromoacetylbromide in 192 ml of methylene chloride, over a period of 60 minutes under a calcium sulfate drying tube. The resultant solutioh is stirred for 2 hours at ice-water temperature under a calcium sulfate drying tube, then pjoured into 3.5 liters of ethyl acetate. The resultant precipitate is filtered, washed with ethyl apetate, and the filtrate is concentrated to obtain (2-carbamoylpyrroIidino)-carbonylmkhylene-(S)-bromide (hard yellow taffy).<br><br>
b) 50.Gfcg of the bromide compound prepared in a) above is dissolved in 300 ml of methylene chloride and the solution is cooled in an ice water bath under a calcium sulfate drying tube, The cooled jsolution is then poured into 60.2 ml of trifluoroacetic anhydride over a 2 minute period, the resultant solution is stirred at ice-water temperature under a calcium sulfate drying tube for 4 ^ :&gt;urs, and partitioned between methylene chloride and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonateL The product is extracted into the methylene chloride layer and the aqueous layer is washed twice with methylene chloride. The combined organic<br>
layers are washes! successively with water and brine and then dried over sodium sulfate. The solution is filtered and the solvent is removed by rotovaping and high vacuum pumping to obtain (2-cyanopyrrolidino)carbonylmethylene-(S)-bromide (dark yellow solid).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the invention in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition saltjform, hereinafter briefly named "the agents of the invention", in particular, the compounds of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form, possess pharmacological activity. They are therefore indicated for use as pharmaceuticals.<br>
In particular, they inhibit DPP-IV. This activity may be demonstrated employing the Caco-2 DPP-IV assay, which measures the ability of test compounds to inhibit DPP-IV activity from human colonic carcinoma cell extracts. The human colonic carcinoma cell line Caco-2 can be offjained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HTB 37). Differentiation of the cells to induce DPP-IV expression is accomplished as described by Reisher et al. in Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 90 (1993) 5757-5761. Cell extract is prepared from cells solubilized in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.04 t.i.u. (trypsin inhibitor unit) aprotinin, 0.5% non-ionic detergent P40, pH 8.0, which is centrifuged at 35 000 g for 30 min at 4°C to remove cell debris. The assay is conducted by adding 20 mg solubilized Caco-2 protein, diluted to a final volume of 125 ml in assay buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM KC1, 1% bovine serum albumin) to microtiter plate wells. The reaction is initiated by adding 25ml of 1 mM substrate (H-Alanine-Proline-pNA; pNA is p-nitroaniline). The reaction is run at room temperature for 10 minutes after which time a 19 ml volume of 25% glacial acetic acid is added to stop the reaction. Test compounds are typically added as 30 ml additions and the assay buffer volume is reduced to 95 ml. A standard curve of free p-nitroaniline is gerjerated using 0-500 mM solutions of free pNA in assay buffer. The curve generated is linear and is used for interpolation of substrate consumption (catalytic activity in nmoles substrate cleaved /min). The endpoint is determined by measuring absorbance at 405 nm in a Molecular Devices UV Max microtiter plate reader. The potency of the test compounds as DPP-IV inhibitors, expressed as IC50, is calculated from 8-point, dose-response curves using a 4-parameter logistic function.<br>
In the above test, IC50 values of from about 10 nM to about 900 nM are obtained with the agents of the invention, e.g. 22 nM for the agent of Example 3.<br>
The DPP-IV inhibition may also be demonstrated by measuring the effects of test compounds on DPP-IV activity in human and rat plasma employing a modified version of the assay described by Kubota et al. in Clin.Exp.Immunol. 82 (1992) 192-197. Briefly, five ml<br>
of plasma are added to 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Falcon), followed by the addition<br>
i       •<br>
'.      i<br><br>
of 5 ml of 80 mM MgCl2 in incubation buffer (25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl,<br>
1 % RIA-grade BSA, pH 7.8). After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, the reaction is<br>
initiated by the addition of 10 ml of incubation buffer containing 0.1 mM substrate (H-Glycine-<br>
Proline-AMC; AMC is 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin). The plates are covered with aluminum<br>
foil (or kept in the dark) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After the 20 min<br>
reaction, fluorescence is measured using a CytoFluor 2350 fluorimeter (Excitation 380 nm<br>
Emission 460 nm; sensitivity setting 4). Test compounds are typically added as 2 ml additions<br>
and the assay	volume is reduced to 13 ml. A fluorescence-concentration curve of free<br>
AMC is generated using 0-50 mM solutions of AMC in assay buffer. The curve generated is linear and is ,iised for interpolation of substrate consumption (catalytic activity in nmoles substrate cleaved/min). As with the previous assay, the potency of the test compounds as DPf-rV inhibitors, expressed as IC501 is calculated from 8-point, dose-response curves using a 4 fiprameter logistic function.<br>
In the above assay, IC50 values of from about 7 nM to about 2000 nM are obtained in human plasma, and of from about 3 nM to about 400 nM in rat plasma, e.g., for the agent of v Example 3, of 7 nM in human and 6 nM in rat plasma, respectively.<br>

In view of their ability to inhibit DPP-IV, the agents of the invention are indicated for use in treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV. It is expected that the compounds disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, arthritis, obesity, and osteoporosis such as calcitonin-osteoporosis. The agents of the invention improve early insulin response to an oral glucose challenge and, therefore, are particularly indicated for use in treating non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and further conditions of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).<br>
The ability of the agents of the invention to improve early insulin response to an oral glucose challenge may e.g. be measured in insulin resistant rats according to the following method:<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats that have been fed a high fat diet (saturated fat = 57 % calories) for 2-3 weeks are fasted for approximately 2 hours on the day of testing, divided into groups of 8-10, and dosed orally with 10 mmol/kg of the test compounds in carboxymethylcellulose (C1-4C). An oral glucose bolus of 1 g/kg is administered 30 min after<br><br>
the test compound directly into the stomach of the test animals. Blood samples, obtained at various Jimepoints from chronic jugular vein catheters are analyzed for plasma glucose and inununoreactlve iftsulin (IRI) concentrations, and plasma DPP-IV activity. Plasma insulin levels are assayed by a double antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) method using a specific ^nti-rat insulin antibody from Unco Research (St. Louis, MO, USA). The RIA has a lower limit of detection of 0.5 mU/ml with intra- and inter-assay variations of less than 5%. Data are expressed as % increase of the mean of the control animals.<br>
It was fomd that upon oral administration, each of the compounds tested amplified the ■i early insulin response which led to an improvement in glucose tolerance in the insulin resistant<br>
test animals. The following results were obtained:<br>

The precise dosage of the agents of the invention to be employed for treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV inhibition depends upon several factors, including the host, the nature and the severity of the condition being treated, the mode of administration and the particular compound employed. However, in general, conditions mediated by DPP-IV inhibition ars effectively treated when an agent of the invention is administered enterally, e.g. orally, or parenterally, e.g. intravenously, preferably orally, at a daily dosage of from about 0.002 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, preferably of from about 0.02 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg body weight or, for most larger primates, a daily dosage of from about 0.1 mg to about 250 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg. A typical oral dosage unit is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 0.75 mg/kg, one to three times a day. Usually, a small dose is administered initially and the dosage is gradually increased until the optimal dosage for the host<br><br>
under treatment is determined. The upper limit of dosage is that imposed by side effects and can be determined by trial for the host being treated.<br>
The agents of the invention may be combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and, optionally, one or more other conventional pharmaceutical adjuvants and administered enterally, e.g. orally, in the form of tablets, capsules, caplets, etc., or parenterally, e.g. intravenously, in the form of sterile injectable solutions or suspensions. The enteral and parenteral compositions may be prepared by conventional means.<br>
The agents of the invention may be formulated into enteral and parenteral pharmaceutical compositions containing an amount of the active substance that is effective for treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV, such compositions in unit dosage form and such compositions pomprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
1   i<br>
■i Those! agents of the invention which are e.g. of formula I may be administered in<br>
enantiomeric&amp;lly pure (S) form (e.g. ^ 98 %, preferably £ 99 % pure) or together with the<br>
other enantiomer, e.g. in racemic form. The above dosage ranges are based on the compounds<br>
of formula I (excluding the amount of R enantiomer).<br>
The invention thus also comprises an agent of the invention, in particular, a<br>
| compound of formula I as defined above, in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid ■'        'i addition salt form, for use as a pharmaceutical. It further includes a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an agent of the invention, in particular a compound of formula I as<br>
defined above, in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form, together<br>
with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. It further comprises the use of<br>
an agent of the invention, in particular, a compound of formula I as defined above, in free form<br>
or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form in the preparation of a medicament<br>
for inhibiting DPP-IV or treating conditions mediated by DPP-IV, by a process comprising<br>
mixing an agent of the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. It<br>
further provides a method of inhibiting DPP-IV, or of treating conditions mediated by<br>
DPP-IV, which comprises administering to a patient in need of such treatment a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, in particular, of formula I in<br>
free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form.<br><br>
The agents of Examples 1,3,5,8 and 12 are the preferred agents of the invention, particularly those of Examples 1,3,5 and 12, preferably in hydrochloride acid addition salt form,  especially the agent of Example 3, namely l-[2-[(5-cyanopyridin-2-yl)amino]-ethylamino]acetyl-2-cyano-(S)-pyrrolidine, preferably in dihydrochloride acid addition salt form. It has been determined that in hydrochloride form they have an IC50 value in the Caco-2 DPP-IV assay of, respectively, 36,22,26, 8 and 279 nM, and in the modified Kubota assay above, an IC50 value Br , respectively, human and rat plasma DPP-IV, of 27 and 22 nM (Example 1); 7 and 6 nM (Example 3); 37 and 18 nM (Example 5); 12 and 11 nM (Example 8); and 95 anii 38 nM (Example 12). It is, therefore, indicated that for the above uses the compounds of Examples 1,3, 5, 8 and 12 may be administered to larger mammals, for example humans, by similar modes of administration at similar dosages than conventionally employed with metformin.<br><br><br><br><br>
