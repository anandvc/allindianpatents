				<td>The present invention relates to a hook for a mail bag. The invention also relates to mail bags having said hook(s) for supporting the mail bags in frame fittings.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
Figure 1  of  the  accompanying drawings  illustrates, in plan view,   a frame 1 for supporting mail bags.     The frame 1 is often known as  a  "drop bag  fitting"   (DBF) frame,     and is usually rectangular or  square  in plan â€¢ view.    At each internal  corner o'f frame 1,   a locating wire or projection 2  is provided.     The locating projections 2   are provided for supporting a mail bag within the frame  in such a way that the mail bag is supported in an open position.<br>
Figure 2  illustrates  a mail bag 4 which is suitable for support in the drop bag fitting frame 1 of Figure 1.     The mail bag 4 has a number   (in this case 4) of mail bag hooks 5  arranged around its  open end.     To support the mail bag the hooks 5 are positioned over the locating projections 2 of the frame 1,  thereby holding the mail 'bag in place in the frame.<br>
However,   existing designs  of mail bag hook 5  are less than ideal.     For example,   one disadvantage of present design of hook is  that  they do not retain the. mail bag in place on the locating projections  of the frame  particularly before the mail bag is filled with mail.     One particular existing design uses horizontal wings which extend along the.open edge of the -.nail bag, which -wings engage under the frame 1 to retain the bag in place.     However,   to release these wings can take a considerable effort and operators sometimes- find that the hook section moulded to the wing section breaks under the load.     This then leaves a' sharp end section of plastic which has  caused injury to operators.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a mail bag hook which can overcome the drawbacks of the presently considered hooks, and that provides secure location of a mail bag on the frame, while still allowing relatively straight forward removal of the hook from the projection.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a hook for a mail bag, the hook comprising a retaining portion for attachment to a region of the mail bag adjacent to an open end thereof, the retaining portion extending substantially perpendicular to the open end of the mail bag, and a suspension ring which extends from the retaining portion and defines an aperture through which a locating projection can be-inserted,<br>
wherein the hook is provided with a resilient portion which extends in the aperture of the hook, such that in use, the portion is deflected.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a hook for a mail bag, the hook comprising:<br>
. a planar attachment portion for attachment to a mail bag, the attachment portion defining a longitudinal axis;<br>
a planar supporting portion which extends from the attachment portion in the direction of the longitudinal axis, and which is planar with the attachment portion, the supporting portion defining an aperture therethrough, and<br>
a retaining portion which extends in the plane of the supporting portion, and which partially occludes the aperture of the supporting portion, the retaining portion being resiliently deformable out of the plane of the supporting portion,.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a drop bag fitting (DBF) frame;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a mail bag;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a mail bag hook embodying one aspect of the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the hook of Figure 3 prior to attachment to the frame of Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the hook of Figure 3 attached to the frame of Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a mail bag hook 5 embodying the present invention.  The hook is generally planar (as can be more clearly seen in Figure 4) and extends along a longitudinal axis 8.  In the embodiment of Figure 3, the hook is symmetrical about the longitudinal axis 8.  The hook 5 is attached to the mail bag 4 by stitching the attachment portion 7 to edge of the mail bag at its open end. . In use, the hook is arranged so that the longitudinal extends substantially perpendicular to the edge of the mail bag 4.<br>
The hook 5 also includes a supporting portion 9 which extends in the direction of the longitudinal axis from the attachment portion 7.  This supporting portion 9 extends away from the end of the mail bag 4 when the hook is attached thereto. The supporting portion defines an aperture 10 through which the locating projection 2 of the frame 1 can be inserted.<br><br>
The hook also includes a retaining portion 11 which partially extends across the aperture 10.  The retaining portion is resiliently deformable, such that it can bend out of the plane of the hook about a hinge point 13.  The retaining portion 11 has a curved top profile 15 which engages with the locating projections 2 of the frame 1 when the hook is in use.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a cross sectional view of a hook 5 and a locating projection 2 mounted on the frame 1, prior to attachment of the hook to the projection. It will be more clear for Figure 4 that the hook in this undeformed state is planar, with the retaining portion 11 being within the supporting portion 9.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the hook 5 attached to the projection 2 on the frame 1.  In order to attach the hook to the projection, the hook is placed over the projection such that the projection extends through the aperture 10 of the hook.  The projection 2 bends or deforms the retaining portion of the hook out of the plane of the hook as illustrated in Figure 5.  The resilience of the retraining portion presses its curved top profile 15 against the underside of the projection 2 so as to hold the hook in place against the projection 2.  This prevents the hook from being inadvertently lifted from the projection 2..  However, the resilience of the retaining portion is such that only a relatively small force is required to lift the hook from the locating projection when required.<br>
It will therefore be appreciated that a hook embodying the present invention can overcome the disadvantages of the presently-used mail bag hook.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A hook (5) for a mail bag (4), the hook (5) comprising:<br>
a planar attachment portion (7) for attachment to a mail bag (4), the<br>
attachment portion (7) defining a longitudinal axis (8);<br>
a planar supporting portion (9) which extends from the attachment portion<br>
(7) in the direction of the longitudinal axis (8), and which is planar with the<br>
attachment portion (7), the supporting portion (9) defining an aperture (10)<br>
there through, and<br>
a retaining portion (11) which extends in the plane of the supporting portion<br>
(9), and which partially occludes the aperture (10) of the supporting portion<br>
(9), the retaining portion (11) being resiliently deformable out of the plane of<br>
the supporting portion (9).<br>
2.	A hook (5) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the supporting portion (9) defines<br>
a continuous boundary around the aperture (10).<br>
3.	A hook (5) as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the supporting portion (9) is<br>
elongate and extends from a base portion connected with the attachment<br>
portion (7) to a tip portion, thereby defining an elongate aperture.<br>
4.	A hook as claimed in claim 3, wherein the retaining portion (11) extends<br>
from the base portion towards the tip portion.<br>
5.	A mail bag (4) comprising a bag having an edge region defining an open<br>
end of the bag, and a plurality of hooks, each of which is a hook (5) as<br>
claimed in anyone of the preceding claims, the longitudinal axis (8) of each<br>
hook (5) being substantially perpendicular to the edge region of the bag.<br>
6.	A hook (5) for a mail bag (4) substantially as herein described with<br>
reference to and as illustrated in Figures 3 to 5 of the accompanying<br><br>
drawings.<br>
