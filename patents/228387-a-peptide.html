				<td>A PEPTIDE CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br><br>
Priority is claimed to United States provisional patent application Serial No. 60/470,245 filed<br>
May 12, 2003. The contents of this priority application are hereby incorporated into this disclosure by<br>
reference and in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to peptide compounds that are agonists of the erythropoietin<br>
receptor (EPO-R). The invention also relates to therapeutic methods using such peptide compounds to<br>
treat disorders associated with insufficient or defective red blood cell production. Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, which comprise the peptide compounds of the invention, are also provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone of 165 amino acids, with a molecular weight of<br>
about 34 kilodaltons (kD) and preferred glycosylation sites on amino-acid positions 24, 38, 83, and 126.<br>
It is initially produced as a precursor protein with a signal peptide of 23 amino acids. EPO can occur in<br>
three forms: α, β, and asialo. The a and p forms differ slightly in their carbohydrate components, but<br>
have the same potency, biological activity, and molecular weight. The asialo form is an α or β form with<br>
the terminal carbohydrate (sialic acid) removed. The DNA sequences encoding EPO have been reported<br>
[U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,008 to Lin].<br>
EPO stimulates mitotic division and differentiation of erythrocyte precursor cells, and thus<br>
ensures the production of erythrocytes. It is produced in the kidney when hypoxic conditions prevail.<br>
During EPO-induced differentiation of erythrocyte precursor cells, globin synthesis is induced; heme<br>
complex synthesis is stimulated; and the number of ferritin receptors increases. These changes allow the<br>
cell to take on more iron and synthesize functional hemoglobin, which in mature erythrocytes binds<br>
oxygen. Thus, erythrocytes and their hemoglobin play a key role in supplying the body with oxygen.<br>
These changes are initiated by the interaction of EPO with an appropriate receptor on the cell surface of<br>
the erythrocyte precursor cells [See, e.g., Graber and Krantz (1978) Ann. Rev. Med. 29.51-66].<br><br>
EPO is present in very low concentrations in plasma when the body is in a healthy state wherein<br>
tissues, receive sufficient oxygenation from the existing number of erythrocytes. This normal low<br>
concentration is sufficient to stimulate replacement of red blood cells which are, lost normally through<br>
aging.<br>
The amount of EPO in the circulation is increased under conditions of hypoxia when oxygen<br>
transport by blood cells in the circulation is reduced. Hypoxia may be caused, for example, by substantial<br>
blood loss through hemorrhage, destruction of red blood cells by over-exposure to radiation, reduction in.<br>
oxygen intake due to high altitude or prolonged unconsciousness, or various forms of anemia. In<br>
response to such hypoxic stress, elevated EPO levels increase red blood cell production by stimulating the<br>
proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells. When the number of red blood cells in circulation is greater<br>
than needed for normal tissue oxygen requirements, EPO levels in circulation are decreased.<br>
Because EPO is essential in the process of red blood cell formation, this hormone has potentially<br>
useful applications in both the diagnosis and the treatment of blood disorders characterized by low or<br>
defective red blood cell production. Recent studies have provided a basis for the projection of EPO<br>
therapy efficacy for a variety of disease states, disorders, and states of hematologic irregularity, including:<br>
beta-thalassemia [see, Vedovato, et al. (1984) Acta. Haematol. 71:211-213]; cystic fibrosis [see,<br>
Vichinsky, et al. (1984) J. Pediatric 105:15-21]; pregnancy and menstrual disorders [see, Cotes, et al.<br>
(193) Brit. J. Ostet. Gyneacol. 90:304-311]; early anemia of prematurity [see, Haga, et al. (1983) Acta<br>
Pediatr. Scand. 72; 827-831]; spinal cord injury [see, Claus-Walker, et al. (1984) Arch. Phys. Med.<br>
Rehabil. 65:370-374]; space flight [see, Dunn, et al. (1984) Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 52:178-182]; acute<br>
blood loss [see, Miller, et al. (1982) Brit. J. Haematol. 52:545-590]; aging [see, Udupa, et al. (1984) J.<br>
Lab. Clin. Med. 103:574-580 and 581-58S and Lipschitz, et al. (1983) Blood 63:502-509]; various<br>
neoplastic disease states accompanied by abnormal erythropoiesis [see, Dainiak, et al. (1983) Cancer<br>
5:1101-1106 and Schwartz, et al. (1983) Otolaryngol. 109:269-272]; and renal insufficiency [see,<br>
Eschbach. et al. (1987) N. Eng. J. Med. 316:73-78].<br>
Purified, homogeneous EPO has been characterized [U.S. Pat. No. 4,677,195 to Hewick]. A<br>
DNA sequence encoding EPO was purified, cloned, and expressed to produce recombinant polypeptides<br>
with the same biochemical and immunological properties as natural EPO. A recombinant EPO molecule<br>
with oligosaccharides identical to those on natural EPO has also been produced [See, Sasaki, et al. (1987)<br>
J. Biol. Chem. 262:12059-12076].<br>
The biological effect of EPO appears to be mediated, in part, through interaction with a cell<br>
membrane bound receptor. Initial studies, using immature erythroid cells isolated from mouse spleen,<br>
suggested that the EPO-binding cell surface proteins comprise two polypeptides having approximate<br>
molecular weights of 85,000 Daltons and 100,000 Daltons, respectively [Sawyer, et al. (1987) Proc. Natl.<br><br>
Acad. Sci. USA 84:3690-3694]. The number of EPO-binding sites was calculated to average from 800 to<br>
1000 per cell surface. Of these binding sites, approximately 300 bound EPO with a Kd of approximately<br>
90 pM (picomolar), while the remaining bound EPO with a reduced affinity of approximately 570 pM<br>
[Sawyer, et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chean. 262:5554-5562]. An independent study suggested that EPO-<br>
responsive splenic erythroblasts, prepared from mice injected with the anemic strain (FVA) of the Friend<br>
leukemia virus, possess a total of approximately 400 high and low affinity EPO binding sites with Kd<br>
values of approximately 100 pM and 800 pM, respectively [Landschulz, et al. (1989) Blood 73:1476-<br>
1486].<br>
Subsequent work indicated that the two forms of EPO receptor (EPO-R) were encoded by a<br>
single gene. This gene has been cloned [See, e.g., Jones, et al. (1990) Blood 76, 31-35; Noguchi, et al.<br>
(1991) Blood 78:2548-2556; Maouche, et al. (1991) Blood 78:2557-2563]. For example, the DNA<br>
sequences and encoded peptide sequences for murine and human EPO-R proteins are described in PCT<br>
Pub. No. WO 90/08822 to D'Andrea, et al. Current models suggest that binding of EPO to EPO-R results<br>
in the dimerization and activation of two EPO-R molecules, which results in subsequent steps of signal<br>
transduction [See, e.g., Watowich, et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:2140-2144].<br>
The availability of cloned genes for EPO-R facilitates the search for agonists and antagonists of<br>
this important receptor. The availability of the recombinant receptor protein allows the study of receptor-<br>
ligand interaction in a variety of random and semi-random peptide diversity generation systems. These<br>
systems include the "peptides on plasmids" system [described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,170]; the "peptides<br>
on phage" system [described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018 and Cwirla, et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 87:6378-6382]; the "encoded synthetic library" (ESL) system [described in U.S. patent application<br>
Ser. No. 946,239, filed Sep. 16, 1992]; and the "very large scale immobilized polymer synthesis" system<br>
[described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; PCT Pub. No. 90/15070; Fodor, et al. (1991) Science 251:767-773;<br>
Dower and Fodor (1991) Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 26:271-180; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,186].<br>
Peptides that interact to a least some extent with EPO-R have been identified and are described,<br>
for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,773,569; 5,830,851; and 5,986,047 to Wrighton, et al; PCT Pub. No. WO<br>
96/40749 to Wrighton, et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,078 and PCT Pub. No. 96/40772 to Johnson and Zivin;<br>
PCT Pub. No. WO 01/38342 to Balu; and WO 01/91780 to Smith-Swintosky, et al. In particular, a group<br>
of peptides containing a peptide motif has been identified, members of which bind to EPO-R and<br>
stimulate EPO-dependent cell proliferation. Yet, peptides identified to date that contain the motif<br>
stimulate EPO-dependent cell proliferation in vitro with EC50 values between about 20 nanomolar (nM)<br>
and 250nM. Thus, peptide concentrations of 20nM to 250nM are required to stimulate 50% of the<br>
maximal cell proliferation stimulated by EPO.<br><br>
Given the immense potential of EPO-R agonists, both for studies of the important biological<br>
activities mediated by this receptor and for treatment of disease, there remains a need for the<br>
identification of peptide EPO-R agonists of enhanced potency and activity. The present invention<br>
provides such compounds.<br>
The citation and/or discussion of cited references in this section and throughout the specification<br>
is provided-merely to clarify the description of the present invention and is not an admission that any such<br>
reference is "prior art" to the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides EPO-R agonist peptides of dramatically enhanced potency and<br>
activity. These agonists include monomelic peptide agonists of 17 to about 40 amino acids in length that<br>
comprise the core amino acid sequence LYACHX0GPITX1VCQPLR (SEQ ID NO: 1), where each amino<br>
acid is indicated by standard one letter abbreviation, X0 is methionine (M) or homoserine methylether<br>
(Hsm), and X1 is tryptophan (W), 1-naphthylalanine (1-nal), or 2-naphthylalanine (2-nal); as well as<br>
dimeric peptide agonists that comprise two peptide monomers, wherein each peptide monomer is of 17 to<br>

(M) or homoserine methylether (Hsm), and X1 is tryptophan (W), 1-naphthylalanine (1-nal), or 2-<br>
naphthylalanine (2-nal). The potency of these novel peptide agonists may be further enhanced by one or<br>
more modifications, including: acetylation, intramolecular disulfide bond formation, and covalent<br>
attachment of one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties. The invention further provides<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprised of such peptide agonists, and methods to treat various medical<br>
conditions using such peptide agonists.<br>

As used herein, the term "polypeptide" or "protein" refers to a polymer of amino acid monomers<br>
that are alpha amino acids joined together through amide bonds. Polypeptides are therefore at least two<br>
amino acid residues in length, and are usually longer. Generally, the term "peptide" refers to a<br>
polypeptide that is only a few amino acid residues in length. The novel EPO-R agonist peptides of the<br>
present invention are preferably no more than about 50 amino acid residues in length. They are more<br>
preferably from about 17 to about 40 amino acid residues in length. A polypeptide, in contrast with a<br>
peptide, may comprise any number of amino acid residues. Hence, the term polypeptide included<br>
peptides as well as longer sequences of amino acids.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and<br>
compositions that are "generally regarded as safe", e.g., that are physiologically tolerable and do not<br>
typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such as gastric upset, dizziness and the like,<br>
when administered to a human. Preferably, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means<br>
approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia<br>
or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The<br>
term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the compound is<br>
administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those<br>
of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil<br>
and the like. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are<br>
preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E.W. Martin.<br>
As used herein the term "agonist" refers to a biologically active ligand which binds to its<br>
complementary biologically active receptor and activates the latter either to cause a biological response in<br>
the receptor, or to enhance preexisting biological activity of the receptor.<br>
Novel peptides that are EPO-R agonists<br>
The present invention relates to peptides that are agonists of the EPO-R and show dramatically<br>
enhanced potency and activity. These peptide agonists are preferably of 17 to about 40 amino acids in<br>
length and comprise the core amino acid sequence LYACHX0GPITX1VCQPLR (SEQ ID NO: 1), where<br>
each amino acid is indicated by standard one letter abbreviation, X0 is methionine (M) or homoserine<br>
methylether (Hsm), and X1 is tryptophan (W), 1-naphthylalanine (1-nal), or 2-naphthylalanine (2-nal).<br>
The peptides of this invention may be monomers, dimers, or other multimers. The peptide<br>
multimers of the invention may be trimers, tetramers, pentamers, or other higher order structures.<br><br>
Moreover, such dimers and other multimers may be heterodimers or heteromultimers. The peptide<br>
monomers of the present invention may be degradation products (e.g., oxidation products of methionine<br>
or deamidated glutamine, arganine, and C-terminus amide). Such degradation products may be used in<br>
and are therefore considered part of the present invention. In preferred embodiments, the heteromultimers<br>
of the invention comprise multiple peptides that are all EPO-R agonist peptides. In highly preferred<br>
embodiments, the multimers of the invention are homomultimers: i.e., they comprise multiple EPO-R<br>
agonist peptides of the same amino acid sequence.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to dimeric peptide agonists of EPO-R, which show<br>
dramatically enhanced potency and activity. In preferred embodiments, the dimers of the invention<br>
comprise two peptides that are both EPO-R agonist peptides. These preferred dimeric peptide agonists<br>
comprise two peptide monomers, wherein each peptide monomer is of 17 to about 40 amino acids in<br>
length and comprises the core amino acid sequence LYACHX0GPITX1VCQPLR (SEQ ID NO: 1), where<br>
each amino acid is indicated by standard one letter abbreviation, X0 is methionine (M) or homoserine<br>
methylether (Hsm), and X1 is tryptophan (W), 1-naphthylalanine (1-nal), or 2-naphthylalanine (2-nal). In<br>
particularly preferred embodiments, the dimers of the invention comprise two EPO-R agonist peptides of<br>
the same amino acid sequence.<br>
According to some embodiments of the invention, two or more, and preferably from two to six<br>
amino acid residues, independently selected from any of the 20 genetically encoded L-amino acids or the<br>
stereoisomeric D-amino acids, will be coupled to either or both ends of the core sequence described<br>
above. For example, the sequence GG will often be appended to. either terminus or both termini of the<br>
core sequence.<br>
Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino<br>
acids such as a,a-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional<br>
amino acids may also be suitable components for compounds of the present invention. Examples of<br>
unconventional amino acids include, but are not limited to: p-alanine, 3-pyridylalanine, 4-hydroxyproline,<br>
O-phosphoserine, N-methylglycine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-<br>
hydroxylysine, nor-leucine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids.<br>
Other modifications are also possible, including modification of the amino terminus, modification<br>
of the carboxy terminus, replacement of one or more of the naturally occurring genetically encoded amino<br>
acids with an unconventional amino acid, modification of the side chain of one or more amino acid<br>
residues, peptide phosphorylation, and the like. A preferred amino terminal modification is acetylation<br>
(e.g., with acetic acid or a halogen substituted acetic acid). In preferred embodiments an N-terminal<br>
glycine is acetylated to N-acetylglycine (AcG). In preferred embodiments, a the C-terminal glycine is N-<br>
methylglycine (MeG, also known as sarcosine).<br><br><br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the peptide monomers of the invention contain an intramolecular<br>
'disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues of the core sequence. Such monomers may be<br>
represented schematically as follows:<br><br>
The present invention also provides conjugates of these peptide monomers. Thus, according to a<br>
preferred embodiment, the monomeric peptides of the present invention are dimerized or oligomerized,<br>
thereby enhancing EPO-R agonist activity.<br>
In one embodiment, the peptide monomers of the invention may be oligomerized using the<br>
biotin/streptavidin system. Biotinylated analogs of peptide monomers may be synthesized by standard<br>
techniques. For example, the peptide monomers may be C-terminally biotinylated. These biotinylated<br>
monomers are then oligomerized by incubation with streptavidin [e.g., at a 4:1 molar ratio at room<br>
temperature in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or HEPES-buffered RPMI medium (Invitrogen) for 1<br>
hour]. In a variation of this embodiment, biotinylated peptide monomers may be oligomerized by<br>
incubation with any one of a number of commercially available anti-biotin antibodies [e.g., goat anti-<br>
biotin IgG from Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Washington, DC)].<br>
In preferred embodiments, the peptide monomers of the invention are dimerized by covalent<br>
attachment to at least one linker moiety. The linker (LK) moiety is preferably, although not necessarily, a<br>
C1-12 linking moiety optionally terminated with one or two -NH- linkages and optionally substituted at one<br>
or more available carbon atoms with a lower alkyl substituent. Preferably the linker LK comprises -NH-<br>
R-NH- wherein R is a lower (C1-6) alkylene substituted with a functional group such as a carboxyl group<br>
or an amino group that enables binding to another molecular moiety (e.g., as may be present on the<br>
surface of a solid support). Most preferably the linker is a lysine residue or a lysine amide (a lysine<br>
residue wherein the carboxyl group has been converted to an amide moiety -CONH2). In preferred<br>
embodiments, the linker bridges the C-termini of two peptide monomers, by simultaneous attachment to<br>
the C-terminal amino acid of each monomer.<br>
For example, when the C-terminal linker LK is a lysine amide the dimer may be illustrated<br>
structurally as shown in Formula I, and summarized as shown in Formula II:<br><br><br>
In Formula I and Formula IT, N2 represents the nitrogen atom of lysine's e-amino group and N1 represents<br>
the nitrogen atom of lysine's α-amino group. The dimeric structure can be written as [peptide]2Lys-<br>
amide to denote a peptide bound to both the α and ε amino groups of lysine, or [Ac-peptide]2Lys-amide<br>
to denote an N-terminally acetylated peptide bound to both the a and s amino groups of lysine, or [Ac-<br>
peptide, disulfide]2Lys-amide to denote an N-terminally acetylated peptide bound to both the α and<br>
ε amino groups of lysine with each peptide containing an intramolecular disulfide loop, or [Ac-peptide,<br>
disulfide]2Lys-spacer-PEG to denote an N-terminally acetylated peptide bound to both the α and ε amino<br>
groups of lysine with each peptide containing an intramolecular disulfide loop and a spacer molecule<br>
forming a covalent linkage between the C-terminus of lysine and a PEG moiety, or [Ac-peptide-Lys*-<br>
NH2]2 Iminodiacetic-N-(Boc-Ala) to denote a homodimer of an N-terminally acetylated peptide bearing<br>
a C-terminal Iysineamide residue where the £ amine of lysine is bound to each of the two carboxyl groups<br>
of iminodiacetic acid and where Boc-beta-alanine is covalently bound to the nitrogen atom of<br>
iminodiacetic acid via an amide bond.<br>
In an additional embodiment, polyethylene glycol (PEG) may serve as the linker Lk that<br>
dimerizes two peptide monomers: for example, a single PEG moiety may be simultaneously attached to<br>
the N-termini of both peptide chains of a peptide dimer.<br>
In yet another additional embodiment, the linker (Lk) moiety is preferably, but not necessarily, a<br>
molecule containing two carboxylic acids and optionally substituted at one or more available atoms with<br>
an additional functional group such as an amine capable of being bound to one or more PEG molecules.<br>
Such a molecule can be depicted as:<br>
-CO-(CH2)n-X-(CH2)m-CO-<br>
where n is an integer from 0 to 10, m is an integer from 1 to 10, X is selected from O, S, N(CH2)pNR1,<br>
NCO(CH2)pNR1, and CHNR1; R1 is selected from H, Boc, Cbz, etc., and p is an integer from 1 to 10.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, one amino group of each of the peptides form an amide bond with the<br>
linker LK. In particularly preferred embodiments, the amino group of the peptide bound to the linker LK is<br>
the epsilon amine of a lysine residue or the alpha amine of the N-terminal residue, or ah amino group of<br>
the optional spacer molecule. In particularly preferred embodiments, both n and m are one, X is<br>
NCO(CH2)pNR1, p is two, and R1 is Boc. A dimeric EPO peptide containing such a preferred linker may<br>
be structurally illustrated as shown in Formula III.<br><br>
Optionally, the Boc group can be removed to liberate a reactive amine group capable of forming a<br>
covalent bond with a suitably activated water soluble polymer species, for example, a PEG species such<br>
as mPEG-para-nitrophenylcarbonate (mPEG-NPC), mPEG-succinimidyl propionate (mPEG-SPA), and<br>
N-hydroxysuccinimide-PEG (NHS-PEG) (see, e.g., US Patent No. 5,672,662). A dimeric EPO peptide<br>
containing such a preferred linker may be structurally illustrated as shown in Formula IV.<br><br>
Generally, although not necessarily, peptide dimers will also contain one or more intramolecular<br>
disulfide bonds between cysteine residues of the peptide monomers. Preferably, the two monomers<br>
contain at least one intramolecular disulfide bond. Most preferably, both monomers of a peptide dimer<br>
contain an intramolecular disulfide bond, such that each monomer contains a cyclic group.<br>
A peptide monomer or dimer may further comprise one or more spacer moieties. Such spacer<br>
moieties may be attached to a peptide monomer or to a peptide dimer. Preferably, such spacer moieties<br>
are attached to the linker LK moiety that connects the monomers of a peptide dimer. For example, such<br>
spacer moieties may be attached to a peptide dimer via the carbonyl carbon of a lysine linker, or via the<br>
nitrogen atom of an iminodiacetic acid linker. For example, such a spacer may connect the linker of a<br><br>
peptide dimer to an attached water soluble polymer moiety or a protecting group. In another example,<br>
, such a spacer may connect a peptide monomer to an attached water soluble polymer moiety.<br>
In one embodiment, the spacer moiety is a C1-12 linking moiety optionally terminated with -NH-<br>
linkages or carboxyl (-COOH) groups, and optionally substituted at one or more available carbon atoms<br>
with a lower alkyl substituent. In one embodiment, the spacer is R-COOH wherein R is a lower (C1-6)<br>
alkylene optionally substituted with a functional group such as a carboxyl group or an amino group that<br>
enables binding to another molecular moiety. For example, the spacer may be a glycine (G) residue, or an<br>
amino hexanoic acid. In preferred embodiments the amino hexanoic acid is 6-amino hexanoic acid<br>
(Ahx). For example, where the spacer 6-amino hexanoic acid (Ahx) is bound to the N-terminus of a<br>
peptide, the peptide terminal amine group may be linked to the carboxyl group of Ahx via a standard<br>
amide coupling. In another example, where Ahx is bound to the C-terminus of a peptide, the amine of<br>
Ahx may be linked to the carboxyl group of the terminal amino acid via a standard amide coupling. The<br>
structure of such a peptide may be depicted as shown in Formula V, and summarized as shown in<br>
Formula VI.<br><br>
In other embodiments, the spacer is -NH-R-NH- wherein R is a lower (C1-6) alkylene substituted<br>
with a functional group such as a carboxyl group or an amino group that enables binding to another<br>
molecular moiety. For example, the spacer may be a lysine (K) residue or a lysine amide (K-NH2, a<br>
lysine residue wherein the carboxyl group has been converted to an amide moiety -CONH2).<br>
In preferred embodiments, the spacer moiety has the following structure:<br><br>
where α, β, γ, δ, and ε are each integers whose values are independently selected. In preferred<br>
embodiments, α, β, and e are each integers whose values are independently selected from one to about six,<br>
5 is zero or one, y is an integer selected from zero to about ten, except that when y is greater than one, β is<br>
two, and Y is selected from NH or CO. In particularly preferred embodiments α, β, and ε are each equal<br>
to two, both γ and δ are equal to 1, and Y is NH. For example, a peptide dimer containing such a spacer<br>
is illustrated schematically in Formula VII, where the linker is a lysine and the spacer joins the linker to a<br>
Boc protecting group.<br><br><br>
In another particularly preferred embodiment y and 5 are zero, a and s together equal five, and Y is CO.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, the linker plus spacer moiety has the structure shown in<br>
Formula VIII or Formula IX.<br><br>
The peptide monomers, dimers, or multimers of the invention may further comprise one or more<br>
water soluble polymer moieties. Preferably, these polymers are covalently attached to the peptide<br>
compounds of the invention. Preferably, for therapeutic use of the end-product preparation, the polymer<br>
will be pharmaceutically acceptable. One skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer<br>
based on such considerations as whether the polymer-peptide conjugate will be used therapeutically, and<br>
if so, the desired dosage, circulation time, resistance to proteolysis, and other considerations. The water<br>
soluble polymer may be, for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene<br>
glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
poly-l,3-dioxolane, poly-l,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either<br>
homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrroIidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene<br>
glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, and polyoxyethylated polyols. A<br>
preferred water soluble polymer is PEG.<br>
The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. A preferred<br>
PEG for use in the present invention comprises linear, unbranched PEG having a molecular weight that is<br>
greater than 10 kilodaltons (kD) and is more preferably between about 20 and 60 lcD in molecular weight.<br>
Still more preferably, the linear unbranched PEG moiety should have a molecular weight of between<br>
about 20 and 40 kD, with 20 kD PEG being particularly preferred. It is understood that in a given<br>
preparation of PEG, the molecular weights will typically vary among individual molecules. Some<br><br>
molecules will weight more, and some less, than the stated molecular weight. Such variation is generally<br>
reflect by use of the word "about" to describe molecular weights of the PEG molecules.<br>
The number of polymer molecules attached may vary; for example, one, two, three, or more<br>
water soluble polymers may be attached to an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention. The multiple<br>
attached polymers may be the same or different chemical moieties (e.g., PEGs of different molecular<br>
weight). Thus, in a preferred embodiment the invention contemplates EPO-R agonist peptides having<br>
two or more PEG moieities attached thereto. Preferably, both of the PEG moietieis are linear, unbranched<br>
PEG each preferably having a molecular weight of between about 10 and about 60 kD. More preferably,<br>
each linear unbranched PEG moiety has a molecular weight that is between about 20 and 40 kD, and still<br>
more preferably between about 20 and 30 kD with a molecular weight of about 20 kD for each linear PEG<br>
moiety being particularly preferred. However, other molecular weights for PEG are also contemplated in<br>
such embodiments. For example, the invention contemplates and encompasses EPO-R agonist peptides<br>
having two or more linear unbranched PEG moieties attached thereto, at least one or both of which has a<br>
molecular weight between about 20 and 40 kD or between about 20 and 30 kD. In other embodiments the<br>
invention contemplates and encompasses EPO-R agonist peptides having two or more linear unbranched<br>
PEG moieties attached thereto, at least one of which has a molecular weight between about 40 and 60 kD.<br>
In one embodiment, PEG may serve as a linker that dimerizes two peptide monomers. In one<br>
embodiment, PEG is attached to at least one terminus (N-terminus or C-terminus) of a peptide monomer<br>
or dimer. In another embodiment, PEG is attached to a spacer moiety of a peptide monomer or dimer. In<br>
a preferred embodiment PEG is attached to the linker moiety of a peptide dimer. In a highly preferred<br>
embodiment, PEG is attached to a spacer moiety, where said spacer moiety is attached to the linker LK<br>
moiety that connects the monomers of a peptide dimer. In particularly preferred embodiments, PEG is<br>
attached to a spacer moiety, where said spacer moiety is attached to a peptide dimer via the carbonyl<br>
carbon of a lysine linker, or the amide nitrogen of a lysine amide linker.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The peptide sequences of the present invention can be present alone or in conjunction with N-<br>
terminal and/or C-terminal extensions of the peptide chain. Such extensions may be naturally encoded<br>
peptide sequences optionally with or substantially without non-naturally occurring sequences; the<br>
extensions may include any additions, deletions, point mutations, or other sequence modifications or<br>
combinations as desired by those skilled in the art. For example and not limitation, naturally-occurring<br>
sequences may be full-length or partial length and may include amino acid substitutions to provide a site<br>
for attachment of carbohydrate, PEG, other polymer, or the like via side chain conjugation. In a variation,<br>
the amino acid substitution results in humanization of a sequence to make in compatible with the human<br>
immune system/Fusion proteins of all types are provided, including immunoglobulin sequences adjacent<br>
to or in near proximity to the EPO-R activating sequences of the present invention with or without a non-<br>
immunoglobulin spacer sequence. One type of embodiment is an immunoglobulin chain having the EPO-<br>
R activating sequence in place of the variable (V) region of the heavy and/or light chain.<br>
Preparation of the peptide compounds of the invention:<br>
Peptide synthesis<br>
The peptides of the invention may be prepared by classical methods known in the art. These<br>
standard methods include exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase synthesis methods, fragment<br>
condensation, classical solution synthesis, and recombinant DNA technology [See, e.g., Merrifield J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1963 85:2149].<br>
In one embodiment, the peptide monomers of a peptide dimer are synthesized individually and<br>
dimerized subsequent to synthesis. In preferred embodiments the peptide monomers of a dimer have the<br>
same amino acid sequence.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments, the peptide monomers of a dimer are linked via their C-<br>
termini by a linker LK moiety having two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for<br>
peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables<br>
binding to another molecular moiety (e.g., as may be present on the surface of a solid support). In this<br>
case, the two peptide monomers may be synthesized directly onto two reactive nitrogen groups of the<br>
linker LK moiety in a variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. Such synthesis may be sequential<br>
or simultaneous.<br>
Where sequential synthesis of the peptide chains of a dimer onto a linker is to be performed, two<br>
amine functional groups on the linker molecule are protected with two different orthogonally removable<br>
amine protecting groups. In preferred embodiments, the protected diamine is a protected lysine. The<br>
protected linker is coupled to a solid support via the linker's third functional group. The first amine<br><br>
protecting group is removed, and the first peptide of the dimer is synthesized on the first deprotected<br>
amine moiety. Then the second amine protecting group is removed, and the second peptide of the dimer<br>
is synthesized on the second deprotected amine moiety. For example, the first amino moiety of the linker<br>
may be protected with Alloc, and the second with Fmoc. In this case, the Fmoc group (but not the Alloc<br>
group) may be removed by treatment with a mild base [e.g., 20% piperidine in dimethyl formamide<br>
(DMF)], and the first peptide chain synthesized. Thereafter the Alloc group may be removed with a<br>
suitable reagent [e.g., Pd(PPh3)/4-methyl morpholine and chloroform], and the second peptide chain<br>
synthesized. This technique may be used to generate dimers wherein the sequences of the two peptide<br>
chains are identical or different. Note that where different thiol-protecting groups for cysteine are to be<br>
used to control disulfide bond formation (as discussed below) this technique must be used even where the<br>
final amino acid sequences of the peptide chains of a dimer are identical.<br>
Where simultaneous synthesis of the peptide chains of a dimer onto a linker is to be performed,<br>
two amine functional groups of the linker molecule are protected with the same removable amine<br>
protecting group. In preferred embodiments, the protected diamine is a protected lysine. The protected<br>
linker is coupled to a solid support via the linker's third functional group. In this case the two protected<br>
functional groups of the linker molecule are simultaneously deprotected, and the two peptide chains<br>
simultaneously synthesized on the deprotected amines. Note that using this technique, the sequences of<br>
the peptide chains of the dimer will be identical, and the thiol-protecting groups for the cysteine residues<br>
are all the same.<br>
A preferred method for peptide synthesis is solid phase synthesis. Solid phase peptide synthesis<br>
procedures are well-known in the art [see, e.g., Stewart Solid Phase Peptide Syntheses (Freeman and Co.:<br>
San Francisco) 1969; 2002/2003 General Catalog from Novabiochem Corp, San Diego, USA; Goodman<br>
Synthesis of Peptides and Peptidomimeties (Houben-Weyl, Stuttgart) 2002]. In solid phase synthesis,<br>
synthesis is typically commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide using an α-amino protected<br>
resin. A suitable starting material can be prepared, for instance, by attaching the required α-amino acid to<br>
a chloromethylated resin, a hydroxymethyl resin, a polystyrene resin, a benzhydrylamine resin, or the<br>
like. One such chloromethylated resin is sold under the trade name BIO-BEADS SX-1 by Bio Rad<br>
Laboratories (Richmond, CA). The preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin has been described<br>
[Bodonszky, et al. (1966) Chem, Ind. London 38:1597]. The benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin has been<br>
described [Pietta and Marshall (1970) Chem. Commun. 650], and the hydrochloride form is commercially<br>
available from Beckman Instruments, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). For example, an a-amino protected amino<br>
acid may be coupled to a chloromethylated resin with the aid of a cesium bicarbonate catalyst, according<br>
to the method described by Gisin (1973) Helv. Chim. Acta 56:1467.<br><br>
After initial coupling, the α-amino protecting group is removed, for example, using<br>
'trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions in organic solvents at room temperature.<br>
Thereafter, α-amino protected amino acids are successively coupled to a growing support-bound peptide<br>
chain. The a-amino protecting groups are those known to be useful in the art of stepwise synthesis of<br>
peptides, including: acyl-type protecting groups (e.g., formyl, trifluoroacetyl, acetyl), aromatic urethane-<br>
type protecting groups [e.g., benzyloxycarboyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz], aliphatic urethane protecting<br>
groups [e.g., t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl], and alkyl type<br>
protecting groups (e.g., benzyl, triphenylmethyl), fluorenylmefhyl oxycarbonyl (Fmoc), allyloxycarbonyl<br>
(Alloc), and l-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-l-ylidene)ethyl (Dde).'<br>
The side chain protecting groups (typically ethers, esters, trityl, PMC, and the like) remain intact<br>
during coupling and is not split off during the deprotection of the amino-terrninus protecting group or<br>
during coupling. The side chain protecting group must be removable upon the completion of the<br>
synthesis of the final peptide and under reaction conditions that will not alter the target peptide. The side<br>
chain protecting groups for Tyr include tetrahydropyranyl, tert-butyl, trityl, benzyl, Cbz, Z-Br-Cbz, and<br>
2,5-dichlorobenzyl. The side chain protecting groups for Asp include benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, methyl,<br>
ethyl, and cyclohexyl. The side chain protecting groups for Thr and Ser include acetyl, benzoyl, trityl,<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, and Cbz. The side chain protecting groups for Arg include<br>
nitro, Tosyl (Tos), Cbz, adamanryloxycarbonyl mesitoylsulfonyl (Mts), 2,2,4,6,7-<br>
pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl (Pbf), 4-mthoxy-2,3,6-trimethyl-benzenesulfonyl (Mtr), or<br>
Boc. The side chain protecting groups for Lys include Cbz, 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Cl-Cbz), 2-<br>
bromobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Br-Cbz), Tos, or Boc.<br>
After removal of the a-amino protecting group, the remaining protected amino acids are coupled<br>
stepwise in the desired order. Each protected amino acid is generally reacted in about a 3-fold excess<br>
using an appropriate carboxyl group activator such as 2-(lH-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3<br>
tetramethyluronium hexafiuorophosphate (HBTU) or dicyclohexylcarbodimide (DCC) in solution, for<br>
example, in methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), N-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide (DMF), or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the desired peptide is decoupled from<br>
the resin support by treatment with a reagent, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or hydrogen fluoride<br>
(HF), which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin, but also cleaves all remaining side chain<br>
protecting groups. When a chloromethylated resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment results in the<br>
formation of the free peptide acids. When the benzhydrylamine resin is used, hydrogen fluoride treatment<br>
results directly in the free peptide amide. Alternatively, when the chloromethylated resin is employed, the<br>
side chain protected peptide can be decoupled by treatment of the peptide resin with ammonia to give the<br><br>
desired side chain protected amide or with an alkylamine to give a side chain protected alkylamide or<br>
dialkylamide. Side chain protection is then removed in the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen<br>
fluoride to give the free amides, alkylamides, or diallcylamides. In preparing the-esters of the invention,<br>
the resins used to prepare the peptide acids are employed, and the side chain protected peptide is cleaved<br>
with base and the appropriate alcohol (e.g., methanol). Side chain protecting groups are then removed in<br>
the usual fashion by treatment with hydrogen fluoride to obtain the desired ester.<br>
These procedures can also be used to synthesize peptides in which amino aeids other than the 20<br>
naturally occurring, genetically encoded amino acids are substituted at one, two, or more positions of any<br>
of the compounds of the invention. Synthetic amino acids that can be substituted into the peptides of the<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to, N-methyl, L-hydroxypropyl, L-3, 4-<br>
dihydroxyphenylalanyl, δ amino acids such as L- δ-hydroxylysyl and D- δ-methylalanyl, L-α-<br>
methylalanyl, β amino acids, and isoquinolyl. D-amino acids and non-naturally occurring synthetic<br>
amino acids can also be incorporated into the peptides of the present invention.<br>
Peptide modifications<br>
One can also modify the amino and/or carboxy termini of the peptide compounds of the invention<br>
to produce other compounds of the invention. Amino terminus modifications include methylation (e.g., —<br>
NHCH3 or -N(CH3)2), acetylation (e.g., with acetic acid or a halogenated derivative thereof such as α-<br>
chloroacetic acid, α-bromoacetic acid, or α-iodoacetic acid), adding a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, or<br>
blocking the amino terminus with any blocking group containing a carboxylate functionality defined by<br>
RCOO-- or sulfonyl functionality defined by R--SO2 --, where R is selected from alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl,<br>
alkyl aryl, and the like, and similar groups. One can also incorporate a desamino acid at the N-terminus<br>
(so that there is no N-temiinal amino group) to decrease susceptibility to proteases or to restrict the<br>
conformation of the peptide compound. In preferred embodiments, the N-terminus is acetylated. In<br>
particularly preferred embodiments an N-terminal glycine is acetylated to yield N-acetylglycine (AcG).<br>
Carboxy terminus modifications include replacing the free acid with a carboxamide group or<br>
forming a cyclic lactam at the carboxy terminus to introduce structural constraints. One can also cyclize<br>
the peptides of the invention, or incorporate a desamino or descarboxy residue at the termini of the<br>
peptide, so that there is no terminal amino or carboxyl group, to decrease susceptibility to proteases or to<br>
restrict the conformation of the peptide. C-terminal functional groups of the compounds of the present<br>
invention include amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower alkoxy, hydroxy, and carboxy,<br>
and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
One can replace the naturally occurring side chains of the 20 genetically encoded amino acids (or<br>
the stereoisomeric D amino acids) with other side chains, for instance with groups such as alkyl, lower<br><br>
alkyl, cyclic 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered alkyl, amide, amide lower alkyl, amide di(lower alkyl), lower<br>
alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy and the lower ester derivatives thereof, and with 4-, 5-, 6-, to 7-membered<br>
heterocyclic. In particular, proline analogues in which the ring size of the proline residue is changed from<br>
5 members to 4, 6, or 7 members can be employed. Cyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, and if<br>
unsaturated, can be aromatic or non-aromatic. Heterocyclic groups preferably contain one or more<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur heteroatoms. Examples of such groups include the furazanyl, furyl,<br>
imidazolidinyl, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, morpholinyl (e.g. morpholino),<br>
oxazolyl, piperazinyl (e.g., 1-piperazinyl), piperidyl (e.g., 1-piperidyl, piperidino), pyranyl, pyrazinyl,<br>
pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl (e.g., 1-pyrrolidinyl),<br>
pyrrolinyl, pyrrolyl, thiadiazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, thiornorpholinyl (e.g., thiomorpholino), and triazolyl.<br>
These heterocyclic groups can be substituted or unsubstituted. Where a group is substituted, the<br>
substituent can be allcyl, alkoxy, halogen, oxygen, or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl.<br>
One can also readily modify peptides by phosphorylation, and other methods [e.g., as described in<br>
Hruby, et al. (1990) Biochem J 268:249-262].<br>
The peptide compounds of the invention also serve as structural models for non-peptidic<br>
compounds with similar biological activity. Those of skill in the art recognize that a variety of techniques<br>
are available for constructing compounds with the same or similar desired biological activity as the lead<br>
peptide compound, but with more favorable activity than the lead with respect to solubility, stability, and<br>
susceptibility to hydrolysis and proteolysis [See, Morgan and Gainor (1989) Ann. Rep. Med. Chem.<br>
24:243-252]. These techniques include replacing the peptide backbone with a backbone composed of<br>
phosphonates, amidates, carbamates, sulfonamides, secondary amines, and N-methylamino acids.<br>
Formation of disulfide bonds<br>
The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more intramolecular disulfide bonds.<br>
In one embodiment, embodiment, a peptide monomer or dimer comprises at least one intramolecular<br>
disulfide bond. In preferred embodiments, a peptide dimer comprises two intramolecular disulfide bonds.<br>
Such disulfide bonds may be formed by oxidation of the cysteine residues of the peptide core<br>
sequence. In one embodiment the control of cysteine bond formation is exercised by choosing an<br>
oxidizing agent of the type and concentration effective to optimize formation of the desired isomer. For<br>
example, oxidation of a peptide dimer to form two intramolecular disulfide bonds (one on each peptide<br>
chain) is preferentially achieved (over formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds) when the oxidizing<br>
agent is DMSO.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the formation of cysteine bonds is controlled by the selective use of<br>
thiol-protecting groups during peptide synthesis. For example, where a dimer with two intramolecular<br><br>
disulfide bonds is desired, the first monomer peptide chain is synthesized with the two cysteine residues<br>
of the core sequence protected with a first thiol protecting group [e.g., trityl(Trt), allyloxycarbonyl<br>
(Alloc), and l-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)ethyl (Dde)or the like], then the second<br>
monomer peptide is synthesized the two cysteine residues of the core sequence protected with a second<br>
thiol protecting group different from the first thiol protecting group [e.g., acetamidomethyl (Acm), t-butyl<br>
(tBu), or the like]. Thereafter, the first thiol protecting groups are removed effecting bisulfide cyclization<br>
of the first monomer, and then the second thiol protecting groups are removed effecting bisulfide<br>
cyclization of the second monomer.<br>
Other embodiments of this invention provide for analogues of these disulfide derivatives in which<br>
one of the sulfurs has been replaced by a CH2 group or other isotere for sulfur. These analogues can be<br>
prepared from the compounds of the present invention, wherein each core sequence contains at least one<br>
C or homocysteine residue and an a-amino-y-butyric acid in place of the second C residue, via an<br>
intramolecular or intermolecular displacement, using methods known in the art [See, e.g., Barker, et al.<br>
(1992) J. Med. Chem. 35:2040-2048 and Or, et al (1991) J. Org. Chem. 56:3146-3149]. One of skill in<br>
the art will readily appreciate that this displacement can also occur using other homologs of a-amino-y-<br>
butyric acid and homocysteine.<br>
In addition to the foregoing cyclization strategies, other non-disulfide peptide cyclization<br>
strategies can be employed. Such alternative cyclization strategies include, for example, amide-<br>
cyclization strategies as well as those involving the formation of thio-ether bonds. Thus, the compounds<br>
of the present invention can exist in a cyclized form with either an intramolecular amide bond or an<br>
intramolecular thio-ether bond. For example, a peptide may be synthesized wherein one cysteine of the<br>
core sequence is replaced with lysine and the second cysteine is replaced with glutamic acid. Thereafter a<br>
cyclic monomer may be formed through an amide bond between the side chains of these two residues.<br>
Alternatively, a peptide may be synthesized wherein one cysteine of the core sequence is replaced with<br>
lysine. A cyclic monomer may then be formed through a thio-ether linkage between the side chains of the<br>
lysine residue and the second cysteine residue of the core sequence. As such, in addition to disulfide<br>
cyclization strategies, amide-cyclization strategies and thio-ether cyclization strategies can both be readily<br>
used to cyclize the compounds of the present invention. Alternatively, the amino-terminus of the peptide<br>
can be capped with an α-substituted acetic acid, wherein the a-substituent is a leaving group, such as an<br>
α-haloacetic acid, for example, α-chloroacetic acid, a -bromoacetic acid, or α-iodoacetic acid.<br>
Addition of linkers<br>
In embodiments where a peptide dimer is dimerized by a linker LK moiety, said linker may be<br>
incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a linker LK moiety contains<br><br>
two functional groups capable of serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional<br>
group, (e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to another molecular moiety, the<br>
linker may be conjugated to a solid support. Thereafter, two peptide monomers may be synthesized<br>
directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker LK moiety in a variation of the solid phase<br>
synthesis technique.<br>
In alternate embodiments where a peptide dimer is dimerized by a linker LK moiety, said linker<br>
may be conjugated to the two peptide monomers of a peptide dimer after peptide synthesis. Such<br>
conjugation may be achieved by methods well established in the art. in one embodiment, the linker<br>
contains at least two functional groups suitable for attachment to the target functional groups of the<br>
synthesized peptide monomers. For example, a linker with two free amine groups may be reacted with<br>
the C-terminal carboxyl groups of each of two peptide monomers. In another example, linkers containing<br>
two carboxyl groups, either preactivated or in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent, may be reacted<br>
with the N-terminal or side chain amine groups, or C-terminal lysine amides, of each of two peptide<br>
monomers.<br>
Addition of spacers<br>
In embodiments where the peptide compounds contain a spacer moiety, said spacer may be<br>
incorporated into the peptide during peptide synthesis. For example, where a spacer contains a free amino<br>
group and a second functional group {e.g., a carboxyl group or an amino group) that enables binding to<br>
another molecular moiety, the spacer may be conjugated to the solid support. Thereafter, the peptide may<br>
be synthesized directly onto the spacer's free amino group by standard solid phase techniques.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a spacer containing two functional groups is first coupled to the solid<br>
support via a first functional group. Next a linker LK moiety having two functional groups capable of<br>
serving as initiation sites for peptide synthesis and a third functional group (e.g., a carboxyl group or an<br>
amino group) that enables binding to another molecular moiety is conjugated to the spacer via the<br>
spacer's second functional group and the linker's third functional group. Thereafter, two peptide<br>
monomers may be synthesized directly onto the two reactive nitrogen groups of the linker LK moiety in a<br>
variation of the solid phase synthesis technique. For example, a solid support coupled spacer with a free<br>
amine group may be reacted with a lysine linker via the linker's free carboxyl group.<br>
In alternate embodiments where the peptide compounds contain a spacer moiety, said spacer may<br>
be conjugated to the peptide after peptide synthesis. Such conjugation may be achieved by methods well<br>
established in the art. In one embodiment, the linker contains at least one functional group suitable for<br>
attachment to the target functional group of the synthesized peptide. For example, a spacer with a free<br>
amine group may be reacted with a peptide's C-terminal carboxyl group. In another example, a linker<br><br>
with a free carboxyl group may be reacted with the free amine group of a peptide's N-terminus or of a<br>
lysine residue. In yet another example, a spacer containing a free sulfhydryl group may be conjugated to<br>
a cysteine residue of a peptide by oxidation to form a disulfide bond.<br>
Attachment of water soluble polymers<br>
In recent years, water-soluble polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been used for<br>
the covalent modification of peptides of therapeutic and diagnostic importance. . Attachment of such<br>
polymers is thought to enhance biological activity, prolong blood circulation time, reduce<br>
immunogenicity, increase aqueous solubility, and enhance resistance to protease digestion. For example,<br>
covalent attachment of PEG to therapeutic polypeptides such as interleulcins [Knauf, et al. (1988) J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 263; 15064; Tsutsumi, et al. (1995) J. Controlled Release 33:447), interferons (Kita, et al. (1990)<br>
Drug Des. Delivery 6:157), catalase (Abuchowski, et al. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252:582), superoxide<br>
dismutase (Beauchainp, et al. (1983) Anal. Biochem. 131:25), and adenosine deaminase (Chen, et al.<br>
(1981) Biochim. Biophy. Acta 660:293), has been reported to extend their half life in vivo, and/or reduce<br>
their immunogenicity and antigenicity.<br>
The peptide compounds of the invention may further comprise one or more water soluble<br>
polymer moieties. Preferably, these polymers are covalently attached to the peptide compounds. The<br>
water soluble polymer may be, for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene<br>
glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
poly-l,3-dioxolane, poly-l,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either<br>
homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene<br>
glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, and polyoxyetlrylated polyols. A<br>
preferred water soluble polymer is PEG.<br>
Peptides, peptide dimers and other peptide-based molecules of the invention can be attached to<br>
water-soluble polymers (e.g., PEG) using any of a variety of chemistries to link the water-soluble<br>
polymer(s) to the receptor-binding portion of the molecule (e.g., peptide + spacer). A typical embodiment<br>
employs a single attachment junction for covalent attachment of the water soluble polymer(s) to the<br>
receptor-binding portion, however in alternative embodiments multiple attachment junctions may be used,<br>
including further variations wherein different species of water-soluble polymer are attached to the<br>
receptor-binding portion at distinct attachment junctions, which may include covalent attachment<br>
junction(s) to the spacer and/or to one or both peptide chains, in some embodiments, the dimer or higher<br>
order multimer will comprise distinct species of peptide chain (i.e., a heterodimer or other<br>
heteromultimer). By way of example and not limitation, a dimer may comprise a first peptide chain<br>
having a PEG attachment junction and the second peptide chain may either lack a PEG attachment<br><br>
junction or utilize a different linkage chemistry than the first peptide chain and in some variations the<br>
'spacer may contain or lack a PEG attachment junction and said spacer, if PEGylated, may utilize a<br>
linkage chemistry different than that of the first and/or second peptide chains. An alternative embodiment<br>
employs a PEG attached to the spacer portion of the receptor-binding portion and a different water-<br>
soluble polymer (e.g., a carbohydrate) conjugated to a side chain of one of the amino acids of the peptide<br>
portion of the molecule.<br>
A wide variety of polyethylene glycol (PEG) species may be used for PEGylation of the receptor-<br>
binding portion (peptides + spacer). Substantially any suitable reactive PEG reagent can be used. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the reactive PEG reagent will result in formation of a carbamate or amide bond<br>
upon conjugation to the receptor-binding portion. Suitable reactive PEG species include, but are not<br>
limited to, those which are available for sale in the Drug Delivery Systems catalog (2003) of NOF<br>
Corporation (Yebisu Garden Place Tower, 20-3 Ebisu 4-chome, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-6019) and the<br>
Molecular Engineering catalog (2003) of Nelctar Therapeutics (490 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, Alabama<br>
35806). For example and not limitation, the following PEG reagents are often preferred in various<br>
embodiments: rnPEG2-NHS, mPEG2-ALD, multi-Arm PEG, mPEG(MAL)2, mPEG2(MAL), mPEG-<br>
NH2, mPEG-SPA, mPEG-SBA, mPEG-thioesters, mPEG-Double. Esters, mPEG-BTC, mPEG-<br>
ButyrALD, mPEG-ACET, heterofunctional PEGs (NH2-PEG-COOH, Boc-PEG-NHS, Fmoc-PEG-NHS,<br>
NHS-PEG-VS, NHS-PEG-MAL), PEG acrylates (ACRL-PEG-NHS), PEG-phospholipids (e.g., mPEG-<br>
DSPE), multiarmed PEGs of the SUNBRITE series including the GL series of glycerine-based PEGs<br>
activated by a chemistry chosen by those skilled in the art, any of the SUNBPJTE activated PEGs<br>
(including but not limited to carboxyl-PEGs, p-NP-PEGs, Tresyl-PEGs, aldehyde PEGs, acetal-PEGs,<br>
amino-PEGs, thiol-PEGs, maleimido-PEGs, hydroxyl-PEG-amine, amino-PEG-COOH, hydroxyl-PEG-<br>
aldehyde, carboxylic anhydride type-PEG, functionalized PEG-phospholipid, and other similar and/or<br>
suitable reactive PEGs as selected by those skilled in the art for their particular application and usage.<br>
The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. A preferred<br>
PEG for use in the present invention comprises linear, unbranched PEG having a molecular weight of<br>
from about 20 kilodaltons (kD) to about 40kD (the term "about" indicating that in preparations of PEG,<br>
some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). Most preferably, the PEG<br>
has a molecular weight of from about 30kD to about 40kD. Other sizes may be used, depending on the<br>
desired therapeutic profile (e.g., duration of sustained release desired; effects, if any, on biological<br>
activity; ease in handling; degree or lack of antigenicity; and other known effects of PEG on a therapeutic<br>
peptide).<br><br>
The number of polymer molecules attached may vary; for example, one, two, three, or more<br>
water soluble polymers may be attached to an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention. The multiple<br>
attached polymers may be the same or different chemical moieties (e.g., PEGs of different molecular<br>
weight). In some cases, the degree of polymer attachment (the number of polymer moieties attached to a<br>
peptide and/or the total number of peptides to which a polymer is attached) may be influenced by the<br>
proportion of polymer molecules versus peptide molecules in an attachment reaction, as well as by the<br>
total concentration of each in the reaction mixture. In general, the optimum polymer versus peptide ratio<br>
(in terms of reaction efficiency to provide for no excess unreacted peptides and/or polymer moieties) will<br>
be determined by factors such as the desired degree of polymer attachment (e.g., mono, di-, tri-, etc.), the<br>
molecular weight of the polymer selected, whether the polymer is branched or unbranched, and the<br>
reaction conditions for a particular attachment method.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the covalently attached water soluble polymer is PEG. For illustrative<br>
purposes, examples of methods for covalent attachment of PEG (PEGylation) are described below. These<br>
illustrative descriptions are not intended to be limiting. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
a variety of methods for covalent attachment of a broad range of water soluble polymers is well<br>
established in the art. As such, peptide compounds to which any of a number of water soluble polymers<br>
known in the art have been attached by any of a number of attachment methods known in the art are<br>
encompassed by the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, PEG may serve as a linker that dimerizes two peptide monomers. In one<br>
embodiment, PEG is attached to at least one terminus (N-terminus or C-terminus) of a peptide monomer<br>
or dimer. In another embodiment, PEG is attached to a spacer moiety of a peptide monomer or dimer. In <br>
a preferred embodiment PEG is attached to the linker moiety of a peptide dimer. In a highly preferred<br>
embodiment, PEG is attached to a spacer moiety, where said spacer moiety is attached to the linker LK<br>
moiety that connects the monomers of a peptide dimer. Most preferably, PEG is attached to a spacer<br>
moiety, where said spacer moiety is attached to a peptide dimer via the carbonyl carbon of a lysine linker,<br>
or the amide nitrogen of a lysine amide linker.<br>
There are a number of PEG attachment methods available to those skilled in the art [see, e.g.,<br>
Goodson, et al. (1990) Bio/Technology 8:343 (PEGylation of interleukin-2 at its glycosylation site after<br>
site-directed mutagenesis); EP 0 401 384 (coupling PEG to G-CSF); Malik, et al, (1992) Exp. Hematol.<br>
20:1028-1035 (PEGylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride); PCT Pub. No. WO 90/12874 (PEGylation<br>
of erythropoietin containing a recombinantly introduced cysteine residue using a cysteine-specific mPEG<br>
derivative); U.S. Pat. No. 5,757,078 (PEGylation of EPO peptides); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,939<br>
(PEGylation of an N-terminal α-carbon of a peptide)].<br><br>
For example, PEG may be covalently bound to amino acid residues via a reactive group.<br>
Reactive groups are those to which an activated PEG molecule may be bound (e.g., a free amino or<br>
carboxyl group). For example, N-terminal amino acid residues and lysine (K) residues have a free amino<br>
group; and C-terminal amino acid residues have a free carboxyl group. Sulfhydryl groups (e.g., as found<br>
on cysteine residues) may also be used as a reactive group for attaching PEG. In addition, enzyme-<br>
assisted methods for introducing activated groups [e.g., hydrazide, aldehyde, and aromatic-amino groups)<br>
specifically at the C-terminus of a polypeptide have been described [Schwarz, et al. (1990) Methods<br>
Enzymol. 184:160; Rose, et al. (1991) Bioconjugate Chem. 2:154; Gaertner, et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.<br>
269:7224].<br>
For example, PEG molecules may be attached to peptide amino groups using methoxylated PEG<br>
("mPEG") having different reactive moieties. Such polymers include mPEG-succinimidyl succinate,<br>
mPEG-succinimidyl carbonate, mPEG-imidate, mPEG-4-nitrophenyl carbonate, and mPEG-cyanuric<br>
chloride. Similarly, PEG molecules, may be attached to peptide carboxyl groups using methoxylated PEG<br>
with a free amine group (mPEG-NH2).<br>
Where attachment of the PEG is non-specific and a peptide containing a specific PEG attachment<br>
is desired, the desired PEGylated compound may be purified from the mixture of PEGylated compounds.<br>
For example, if an N-terminally PEGylated peptide is desired, the N-terminally PEGylated form may be<br>
purified from a population of randomly PEGylated peptides (i.e., separating this moiety from other<br>
monoPEGylated moieties).<br>
In preferred embodiments, PEG is attached site-specifically to a peptide. Site-specific<br>
PEGylation at the N-terrninus, side chain, and C-terminus of a potent analog of growth hormone-releasing<br>
factor has been performed through solid-phase synthesis [Felix, et al. (1995) Int. J. Peptide Protein Res.<br>
46:253]. Another site-specific method involves attaching a peptide to extremities of liposomal surface-<br>
grafted PEG chains in a site-specific manner through a reactive aldehyde group at the N-terminus<br>
generated by sodium periodate oxidation of N-terminal threonine [Zalipslcy, et al. (1995) Bioconj. Chem.<br>
6:705]. However, this method is limited to polypeptides with N-terminal serine or threonine residues.<br>
Another site-specific method for N-terminal PEGylation of a peptide via a hydrazone, reduced hydrazone,<br>
oxime, or reduced oxime bond is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,939 to Wei, et al.<br>
In one method, selective N-terminal PEGylation may be accomplished by reductive alkylation<br>
which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the<br>
N-terminal) available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions,<br>
a carbonyl group containing PEG is selective attached to the N-terminus of a peptide. For example, one<br>
may selectively N-terminally PEGylate the protein by performing the reaction at a pH which exploits the<br>
pKa differences between the ε-amino groups of a lysine residue and the α- amino group of the N-terminal<br><br>
residue of the peptide. By such selective attachment, PEGylation takes place predominantly at the<br>
N-terminus of the protein, with no significant modification of other reactive groups (e.g., lysine side chain<br>
amino groups). Using reductive alkylation, the PEG should have a single reactive aldehyde for coupling<br>
to the protein (e.g., PEG proprionaldehyde may be used).<br>
Site-specific mutagenesis is a further approach which may be used to prepare peptides for site-<br>
specific polymer attachment. By this method, the amino acid sequence of a peptide is designed to<br>
incorporate an appropriate reactive group at the desired position within the peptide. For example, WO<br>
90/12874 describes the site-directed PEGylation of proteins modified by the insertion of cysteine residues<br>
or the substitution of other residues for cysteine residues. This publication also describes the preparation<br>
of mPEG-erythropoietin ("mPEG-EPO") by reacting a cysteine-specific mPEG derivative with a<br>
recombinantly introduced cysteine residue on EPO.<br>
Where PEG is attached to a spacer or linker moiety, similar attachment methods may be used. In<br>
this case, the linker or spacer contains a reactive group and an activated PEG molecule containing the<br>
appropriate complementary reactive group is used to effect covalent attachment. In preferred<br>
embodiments the linker or spacer reactive group contains a terminal amino group (i.e., positioned at the<br>
terminus of the linker or spacer) which is reacted with a suitably activated PEG molecule to make a stable<br>
covalent bond such as an amide or a carbamate. Suitable activated PEG species include, but are not<br>
limited to, mPEG-para-nitrophenylcarbonate (mPEG-NPC), mPEG-succinimidyl carbonate (mPEG-SC),<br>
and lnPEG-succinimidyl propionate (mPEG-SPA). In other preferred embodiments, the linker or spacer<br>
reactive group contains a carboxyl group capable of being activated to form a covalent bond with an<br>
amine-containing PEG molecule under suitable reaction conditions. Suitable PEG molecules include<br>
mPEG-NH2 and suitable reaction conditions include carbodiimide-mediated amide formation or the like.<br>
EPO-R agonist activity assays:<br>
In vitro functional assays<br>
In vitro competitive binding assays quantitate the ability of a test peptide to compete with EPO<br>
for binding to EPO-R. For example (see, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 5,773,569), the extracellular<br>
domain of the human EPO-R (EPO binding protein, EBP) may be recombinantly produced in E. coli and<br>
the recombinant protein coupled to a solid support, such as a microtitre dish or a synthetic bead [e.g.,<br>
Sulfolink beads from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, EL)]. Immobilized EBP is then incubated with<br>
labeled recombinant EPO, or with labeled recombinant EPO and a test peptide. Serial dilutions of test<br>
peptide are employed for such experiments. Assay points with no added test peptide define total EPO<br>
binding to EBP. For reactions containing test peptide, the amount of bound EPO is quantitated and<br>
expressed as a percentage of the control (total=100%) binding. These values are plotted versus peptide<br><br>
concentration. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of test peptide which reduces the binding<br>
of EPO to EBP by 50% (i.e., 50% inhibition of EPO binding).<br>
A different in vitro competitive binding assay measures the light signal generated as a function of<br>
the proximity of two beads: an EPO-conjugated bead and an EPO-R-conjugated bead. Bead proximity is<br>
generated by the binding of EPO to EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with EPO for binding to EPO-R<br>
will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a 50% decrease in light emission is defined as the IC50 value.<br>
The peptides of the present invention compete very efficiently with EPO for binding to the EPO-<br>
R. This enhanced function is represented by their ability to inhibit the binding of EPO at substantially<br>
lower concentrations of peptide (i.e., they have very low IC50 values).<br>
The biological activity and potency of monomeric and dimeric peptide EPO-R agonists of the<br>
invention, which bind specifically to the EPO-receptor, may be measured using in vitro cell-based<br>
functional assays.<br>
One assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line expressing human EPO-R and further<br>
transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Upon exposure to EPO or<br>
another EPO-R agonist, such cells respond by synthesizing luciferase. Luciferase causes the emission of<br>
light upon addition of its substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of EPO-R activation in such cells may be<br>
quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity. The activity of a test peptide is measured by adding<br>
serial dilutions of the test peptide to the cells, which are then incubated for 4 hours. After incubation,<br>
luciferin substrate is added to the cells, and light emission is measured. The concentration of test peptide<br>
that results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50.<br>
The peptides of the present invention show dramatically enhanced ability to promote EPO-R<br>
signaling-dependent luciferase expression in this assay. This enhanced function is represented by their<br>
ability to yield half of the maximal luciferase activity at substantially lower concentrations of peptide (i.e.,<br>
they have very low EC50 values). This assay is a preferred method for estimating the potency and<br>
activity of an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention.<br>
Another assay may be performed using FDC-P1/ER cells [Dexter, et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med.<br>
152:1036-1047], a well characterized nontransformed murine bone marrow derived cell line into which<br>
EPO-R has been stably transfected. These cells exhibit EPO-dependent proliferation.<br>
In one such assay, the cells are grown to half stationary density in the presence of the necessary<br>
growth factors (see, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 5,773,569). The cells are then washed in PBS and<br>
starved for 16-24 hours in whole media without the growth factors. After determining the viability of the <br>
cells (e.g., by trypan blue staining), stock solutions (in whole media without the growth factors) are made<br>
to give about 105 cells per 50µL. Serial dilutions of the peptide EPO-R agonist compounds (typically the<br><br>
free, solution phase peptide as opposed to a phage-bound or other bound or immobilized peptide) to be<br>
tested, are made in 96-well tissue culture plates for a final volume of 50µL per well. Cells (50µL) are<br>
added to each well and the cells are incubated 24-48 hours, at which point the negative controls should<br>
die or be quiescent. Cell proliferation is then measured by techniques known in the art, such as an MTT<br>
assay which measures H3-thymidine incorporation as an indication of cell proliferation [see, Mosmann<br>
(1983) J. Immunol. Methods 65:55-63]. Peptides are evaluated on both the EPO-R-expressing cell line<br>
and a parental non-expressing cell line. The concentration of test peptide necessary to yield one half of<br>
the maximal cell proliferation is recorded as the EC50.<br>
The peptides of the present invention show dramatically enhanced ability to promote EPO-<br>
dependent cell growth in this assay. This enhanced function is represented by their ability to yield half of<br>
the maximal cell proliferation stimulation activity at substantially lower concentrations of peptide (i.e.,<br>
they have very low EC50 values). This assay is a preferred method for estimating the potency and<br>
activity of an EPO-R agonist peptide of the invention.<br>
In another assay, the cells are grown to stationary phase in EPO-supplemented medium, collected,<br>
and then cultured for an additional 18 hr in medium without EPO. The cells are divided into three groups<br>
of equal cell density: one group with no added factor (negative control), a group with EPO (positive<br>
control), and an experimental group with the test peptide. The cultured cells are then collected at various<br>
time points, fixed, and stained with a DNA-binding fluorescent dye (e.g., propidium iodide or Hoechst<br>
dye, both available from Sigma). Fluorescence is then measured, for example, using a FACS Scan Flow<br>
cytometer. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle may then be determined, for example,<br>
using the SOBR model of CellFIT software (Becton Dickinson). Cells treated with EPO or an active<br>
peptide will show a greater proportion of cells in S phase (as determined by increased fluorescence as an<br>
indicator of increased DNA content) relative to the negative control group.<br>
Similar assays may be performed using FDCP-1 [see, e.g., Dexter et al. (1980) J. Exp. Med.<br>
152:1036-1047] or TF-1 [Kitamura, et al. (1989) Blood 73:375-380] cell lines. FDCP-1 is a growth<br>
factor dependent murine multi-potential primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell line that can proliferate,<br>
but not differentiate, when supplemented with WEHI-3-conditioned media (a medium that contains IL-3,<br>
ATCC number TIB-68). For such experiments, the FDCP-1 cell line is transfected with the human or<br>
murine EPO-R to produce FDCP-1-hEPO-R or FDCP-1-mEPO-R cell lines, respectively, that can<br>
proliferate, but not differentiate, in the presence of EPO. TF-1, an EPO-dependent cell line, may also be<br>
used to measure the effects of peptide EPO-R agonists on cellular proliferation.<br>
In yet another assay, the procedure set forth in Krystal (1983) Exp. Hematol 11:649-660 for a <br>
microassay based on H3-thymidine incorporation into spleen cells may be employed to ascertain the<br>
ability of the compounds of the present invention to serve as EPO agonists. In brief, B6C3F1 mice are<br><br>
injected daily for two days with phenylhydrazine (60 mg/kg). On the third day, spleen cells are removed<br>
and their ability to proliferate over a 24 hour period ascertained using an MTT assay.<br>
The binding of EPO to EPO-R in an erythropoietin-responsive cell line induces tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation of both the receptor and numerous intracellular proteins, including She, vav and JAK2<br>
kinase. Therefore, another in vitro assay measures the ability of peptides of the invention to induce<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation of EPO-R and downstream intracellular signal transducer proteins. Active<br>
peptides, as identified by binding and proliferation assays described above, elicit a phosphorylation<br>
pattern nearly identical to that of EPO in erythropoietin-responsive cells. For this assay, FDC-P1/ER<br>
cells [Dexter, et al. (1980) J Exp Med 152:1036-47] are maintained in EPO-supplemented medium and<br>
grown to stationary phase. These cells are then cultured in medium without EPO for 24 hr. A defined<br>
number of such cells is then incubated with a test peptide for approximately 10 min at 37°C. A control<br>
sample of cells with EPO is also run with each assay. The treated cells are then collected by<br>
centrifugation, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.<br>
The electrophoresed proteins in the gel are transferred to nitrocellulose, and the phosphotyrosine<br>
containing proteins on the blot visualized by standard immunological techniques. For example, the blot<br>
may be probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody {e.g., mouse anti-phosphotyrosine IgG from<br>
Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), washed, and then probed with a secondary antibody [e.g., peroxidase<br>
labeled goat anti-mouse IgG from Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Washington, DC)]. Thereafter,<br>
phosphotyrosine-containing proteins may be visualized by standard techniques including colorimetric,<br>
chemiluminescent, or fluorescent assays. For example, a chemiluminescent assay may be performed<br>
using the ECL Western Blotting System from Amersham.<br>
Another cell-based in viti-o assay that may be used to assess the activity of the peptides of the<br>
present invention comprises a colony assay, using murine bone marrow or human peripheral blood cells.<br>
Murine bone marrow may be obtained from the femurs of mice, while a sample of human peripheral<br>
blood may obtained from a healthy donor. In the case of peripheral blood, mononuclear cells are first<br>
isolated from the blood, for example, by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient [Stem Cell<br>
Technologies, Inc. (Vancouver, Canada)]. For this assay a nucleated cell count is performed to establish<br>
the number and concentration of nucleated cells in the original sample. A defined number of cells is<br>
plated on methyl cellulose as per manufacturer's instructions [Stem Cell Technologies, Inc. (Vancouver,<br>
Canada)]. An experimental group is treated with a test peptide, a positive control group is treated with<br>
EPO, and a negative control group receives no treatment. The number of growing colonies for each<br>
group is then scored after defined periods of incubation, generally 10 days and 18 days. An active peptide<br>
will promote colony formation.<br><br>

An instrument designed by Molecular Devices Corp., known as a microphysiometer, has been<br>
reported to be successfully used for measurement of the effect of agonists and antagonists on various<br>
receptors. The basis for this apparatus is the measurement of the alterations in the acidification rate of the<br>
extracellular media in response to receptor activation.<br>
In vivo functional assays<br>
One in vivo functional assay that may be used to assess the potency of a test peptide is the<br>
polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay. For this assay, mice are subjected to an alternating<br>
conditioning cycle for several days. In this cycle, the mice alternate between periods of hypobaric<br>
conditions and ambient pressure conditions. Thereafter, the mice are maintained at ambient pressure for<br>
2-3 days prior to administration of test samples. Test peptide samples, or EPO standard in the case<br>
positive control mice, are injected subcutaneously into the conditioned mice. Radiolabeled iron (e.g.,<br>
Fe59) is administered 2 days later, and blood samples taken two days after administration of radiolabeled<br>
iron. Hematocrits and radioactivity measurements are then determined for each blood sample by standard<br>
techniques. Blood samples from mice injected with active test peptides will show greater radioactivity<br>
(due to binding of Fe59 by erythrocyte hemoglobin) than mice that did not receive test peptides or EPO.<br>
Another in vivo functional assay that may be used to assess the potency of a test peptide is the<br>
reticulocyte assay. For this assay, normal untreated mice are subcutaneously injected on three<br>
consecutive days with either EPO or test peptide. On the third day, the mice are also intraperitoneally<br>
injected with iron dextran. At day five, blood samples are collected from the mice. The percent (%) of<br>
reticulocytes in the blood is determined by thiazole orange staining and flow cytometer analysis (reric-<br><br>
count program). In addition, hematocrits are manually determined. The percent of corrected<br>
reticulocytes is determined using the following formula:<br>
% RETICCORRECTED = % RETICOBSERVED X (HematocritINDIVIDUAL / HematocritNORMAL.)<br>
Active test compounds will show an increased % RETICCORRECTED level relative to mice that did not<br>
receive test peptides or EPO.<br>
Use of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention<br>
The peptide compounds of the invention are useful in vitro as tools for understanding the<br>
biological role of EPO, including the evaluation of the many factors thought to influence, and be<br>
influenced by, the production of EPO and the binding of EPO to the EPO-R (e.g., the mechanism of EPO<br>
/ EPO-R signal transduction/receptor activation). The present peptides are also useful in the development<br>
of other compounds that bind to the EPO-R, because the present compounds provide important structure-<br>
activity-relationship information that facilitate that development.<br>
Moreover, based on their ability to bind to EPO-R, the peptides of the present invention can be<br>
used as reagents for detecting EPO-R on living cells; fixed cells; in biological fluids; in tissue<br>
homogenates; in purified, natural biological materials; etc. For example, by labeling such peptides, one<br>
can identify cells having EPO-R on their surfaces. In addition, based on their ability to bind EPO-R, the<br>
peptides of the present invention can be used in in situ staining, FACS (fluorescence-activated cell<br>
sorting) analysis, Western blotting, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), etc. In addition, based<br>
on their ability to bind to EPO-R, the peptides of the present invention can be used in receptor<br>
purification, or in purifying cells expressing EPO-R on the cell surface (or inside permeabilized cells).<br>
The peptides of the invention can also be utilized as commercial reagents for various medical<br>
research and diagnostic purposes. Such uses can include but are not limited to: (1) use as a calibration<br>
standard for quantitating the activities of candidate EPO-R agonists in a variety of functional assays; (2)<br>
use as blocking reagents in random peptide screening, i.e., in looking for new families of EPO-R peptide<br>
ligands, the peptides can be used to block recovery of EPO peptides of the present invention; (3) use in<br>
co-crystallization with EPO-R, i.e., crystals of the peptides of the present invention bound to the EPO-R<br>
may be formed, enabling determination of receptor/peptide structure by X-ray crystallography; (4) use to<br>
measure the capacity of erythrocyte precursor cells induce globin synthesis and heme complex synthesis,<br>
and to increase the number of ferritin receptors, by initiating differentiation; (5) use to maintain the<br>
proliferation and growth of EPO-dependent cell lines, such as the FDCP-1-mEPO-R and the TF-1 cell<br>
lines; and (6) other research and diagnostic applications wherein the EPO-R is preferably activated or<br>
such activation is conveniently calibrated against a known quantity of an EPO-R agonist, and the like.<br><br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, methods of treatment and manufacture of a<br>
medicament are provided. The peptide compounds of the invention may be administered to warm<br>
blooded animals, including humans, to simulate the binding of EPO to the EPO-R in vivo. Thus, the<br>
present invention encompasses methods for therapeutic treatment of disorders associated with a<br>
deficiency of EPO, which methods comprise administering a peptide of the invention in amounts<br>
sufficient to stimulate the EPO-R and thus, alleviate the symptoms associated with a deficiency of EPO in<br>
vivo. For example, the peptides of this invention will find use in the treatment ©f renal insufficiency<br>
and/or end-stage renal failure/dialysis; anemia associated with AIDS; anemia associated with chronic<br>
inflammatory diseases (for example, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic bowel inflammation) and<br>
autoimmune disease; and for boosting the red blood count of a patient prior to surgery. Other disease<br>
states, disorders, and states of hematologic irregularity that may be treated by administration of the<br>
peptides of this invention include: beta-thalassemia; cystic fibrosis; pregnancy and menstrual disorders;<br>
early anemia of prematurity; spinal cord injury; space flight; acute blood loss; aging; and various<br>
neoplastic disease states accompanied by abnormal erythropoiesis.<br>
In other embodiments, the peptide compounds of the invention may be used for the treatment of<br>
disorders winch are not characterized by low or deficient red blood cells, for example as a pretreatment<br>
prior to transfusions. In addition, administration of the compounds of this invention can result in a<br>
decrease in bleeding time and thus, will find use in the administration to patients prior to surgery or for<br>
indications wherein bleeding is expected to occur. In addition, the compounds of this invention will find<br>
use in the activation of megakaryoctes.<br>
Since EPO has been shown to have a mitogenic and chemotactic effect on vascular endothelial<br>
cells as well as an effect on central cholinergic neurons [see, e.g., Amagnostou, et al. (1990) Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 87:5978-5982 and Konishi, et al. (1993) Brain Res. 609:29-35], the compounds of this<br>
invention will also find use for the treatment of a variety of vascular disorders, such as: promoting wound<br>
healing; promoting growth of collateral coronary blood vessels (such as those that may occur after<br>
myocardial infarction); trauma treatment; and post-vascular graft treatment. The compounds of this<br>
invention will also find use for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders, generally<br>
characterized by low absolute levels of acetyl choline or low relative levels of acetyl choline as compared<br>
to other neuroactive substances e.g., neurotransmitters.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions of the above EPO-R<br>
agonist peptide compounds are provided. Conditions alleviated or modulated by the administration of<br>
such compositions include those indicated above. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be for<br><br>
administration by oral, parenteral (intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous<br>
injection), transdermal (either passively or using iontophoresis or electroporation), transmucosal (nasal,<br>
vaginal, rectal, or sublingual) routes of administration or using bioerodible inserts and can be formulated<br>
in dosage forms appropriate for each route of administration. In general, comprehended by the invention<br>
are pharmaceutical compositions comprising effective amounts of an EPO-R agonist peptide, or<br>
derivative products, of the invention together with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives,<br>
solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. Such compositions include diluents of various buffer<br>
content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as detergents and<br>
solubilizing agents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium<br>
metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose,<br>
mannitol); incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as<br>
polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc. or into liposomes. Hylauronic acid may also be used. Such<br>
compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo<br>
clearance of the present proteins and derivatives. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th<br>
Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA 18042) pages 1435-1712 which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder (e.g.,<br>
lyophilized) form.<br>
Oral Delivery<br>
Contemplated for use herein are oral solid dosage forms, which are described generally in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. 1990 (Mack Publishing Co. Easton PA 18042) at<br>
Chapter 89, which is herein incorporated by reference. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills,<br>
troches or lozenges, cachets, pellets, powders, or granules. Also, liposomal or proteinoid encapsulation<br>
may be used to formulate the present compositions (as, for example, proteinoid microspheres reported in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,925,673). Liposomal encapsulation may be used and the liposomes may be derivatized<br>
with various polymers (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556). A description of possible solid dosage forms for<br>
the therapeutic is given by Marshall, K. In: Modem Pharmaceutics Edited by G.S. Banker and C.T.<br>
Rhodes Chapter 10, 1979, herein incorporated by reference. In general, the formulation will include the<br>
EPO-R agonist peptides (or chemically modified forms thereof) and inert ingredients which allow for<br>
protection against the stomach environment, and release of the biologically active material in the<br>
intestine.<br>
Also contemplated for use herein are liquid dosage forms for oral administration, including<br>
pharmaceuticaHy acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, and syrups, which may contain other<br><br>
components including inert diluents; adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents; and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
The peptides may be chemically modified so that oral delivery of the derivative is efficacious.<br>
Generally, the chemical modification contemplated is the attachment of at least one moiety to the<br>
component molecule itself, where said moiety permits (a) inhibition of proteolysis; and (b) uptake into the<br>
blood stream from the stomach or intestine. Also desired is the increase in overall stability of the<br>
component or components and increase in circulation time in the body. As discussed above, PEGylation<br>
is a preferred chemical modification for pharmaceutical usage. Other moieties that may be used include:<br>
propylene glycol, copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyproline, poly-l,3-dioxolane and poly-l,3,6-tioxocane [see,<br>
e.g., Abuchowski and Davis (1981) "Soluble Polymer-Enzyme Adducts," in Enzymes as Drugs.<br>
Hocenberg and Roberts, eds. (Wiley-Interscience: New York, NY) pp. 367-383; and Newmarlc, et al.<br>
(1982) J. Appl. Biochem. 4:185-189].<br>
For oral formulations, the location of release may be the stomach, the small intestine (the<br>
duodenum, the jejunem, or the ileum), or the large intestine. One skilled in the art has available<br>
formulations which will not dissolve in the stomach, yet will release the material in the duodenum or<br>
elsewhere in the intestine. Preferably, the release will avoid the deleterious effects of the stomach<br>
environment, either by protection of the peptide (or derivative) or by release of the peptide (or derivative)<br>
beyond the stomach environment, such as in the intestine.<br>
To ensure full gastric resistance a coating impermeable to at least pH 5.0 is essential. Examples<br>
of the more common inert ingredients that are used as enteric coatings are cellulose acetate trimellitate<br>
(CAT), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), HPMCP 50, HPMCP 55, polyvinyl acetate<br>
phthalate (PVAP), Eudragit L30D, Aquateric, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit L, Eudragit S,<br>
and Shellac. These coatings may be used as mixed films.<br>
A coating or mixture of coatings can also be used on tablets, which are not intended for protection<br>
against the stomach. This can include sugar coatings, or coatings which make the tablet easier to<br>
swallow. Capsules may consist of a hard shell (such as gelatin) for delivery of dry therapeutic (i.e.<br>
powder), for liquid forms a soft gelatin shell may be used. The shell material of cachets could be thick<br>
starch or other edible paper. For pills, lozenges, molded tablets or tablet triturates, moist massing<br>
techniques can be used.<br>
The peptide (or derivative) can be included in the formulation as fine multiparticulates in the<br>
form of granules or pellets of particle size about 1mm. The formulation of the material for capsule<br>
administration could also be as a powder, lightly compressed plugs, or even as tablets. These therapeutics<br>
could be prepared by compression.<br><br>
Colorants and/or flavoring agents may also be included. For example, the peptide (or derivative)<br>
"may be formulated (such as by liposome or microsphere encapsulation) and then further contained within<br>
an edible product, such as a refrigerated beverage containing colorants and flavoring agents.<br>
One may dilute or increase the volume of the peptide (or derivative) with an inert material. These<br>
diluents could include carbohydrates, especially mannitol, α-lactose, anhydrous lactose, cellulose,<br>
sucrose, modified dextrans and starch. Certain inorganic salts may be also be used as fillers including<br>
calcium triphosphate, magnesium carbonate and sodium chloride. Some commercially available diluents<br>
are Fast-Flo, Emdex, STA-Rx 1500, Emcompress and Avicell.<br>
Disintegrants may be included in the formulation of the therapeutic into a solid dosage form.<br>
Materials used as disintegrates include but are not limited to starch, including the commercial disintegrant<br>
based on starch, Explotab. Sodium starch glycolate, Amberlite, sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
ultramylopectin, sodium alginate, gelatin, orange peel, acid carboxymethyl cellulose, natural sponge and<br>
bentonite may all be used. The disintegrants may also be insoluble cationic exchange resins. Powdered<br>
gums may be used as disintegrants and as binders, and can include powdered gums such as agar, Karaya<br>
or tragacanth. Alginic acid and its sodium salt are also useful as disintegrants.<br>
Binders may be used to hold the peptide (or derivative) agent together to form a hard tablet and<br>
include materials from natural products such as acacia, tragacanth, starch and gelatin. Others include<br>
methyl cellulose (MC), ethyl cellulose (EC) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Polyvinyl pyrrolidone<br>
(PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) could both be used in alcoholic solutions to granulate<br>
the peptide (or derivative).<br>
An antifrictional agent may be included in the formulation of the peptide (or derivative) to<br>
prevent sticking during the formulation process. Lubricants may be used as a layer between the peptide<br>
(or derivative) and the die wall, and these can include but are not limited to; stearic acid including its<br>
magnesium and calcium salts, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), liquid paraffin, vegetable oils and waxes.<br>
Soluble lubricants may also be used such as sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene<br>
glycol of various molecular weights, Carbowax 4000 and 6000.<br>
Glidants that might improve the flow properties of the drug during formulation and to aid<br>
rearrangement during compression might be added. The glidants may include starch, talc, pyrogenic<br>
silica and hydrated silicoaluminate.<br>
To aid dissolution of the peptide (or derivative) into the aqueous environment a surfactant might<br>
be added as a wetting agent. Surfactants may include anionic detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,<br>
dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl sodium sulfonate. Cationic detergents might be used and could<br>
include benzalkonium chloride or benzethomium chloride. The list of potential nonionic detergents that<br>
could be included in the formulation as surfactants are lauromacrogol 400, polyoxyl 40 stearate,<br><br>
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10, 50 and 60, glycerol monostearate, polysorbate 20, 40, 60, 65<br>
and 80, sucrose fatty acid ester, methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. These surfactants could be<br>
present in the formulation of the protein or derivative either alone or as a mixture in. different ratios.<br>
Additives which potentially enhance uptake of the peptide (or derivative) are for instance the fatty<br>
acids oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.<br>
Controlled l'elease oral formulations may be desirable. The peptide (or derivative) could be<br>
incorporated into an inert matrix which permits release by either diffusion or leaching mechanisms, e.g.,<br>
gums. Slowly degenerating matrices may also be incorporated into the formulation. Some enteric<br>
coatings also have a delayed release effect. Another form of a controlled release is by a method based on<br>
the Oros therapeutic system (Alza Corp.), i.e. the drug is enclosed in a semipermeable membrane which<br>
allows water to enter and push drug out through a single small opening due to osmotic effects.<br>
Other coatings may be used for the formulation. These include a variety of sugars which could be<br>
applied in a coating pan. The peptide (or derivative) could also be given in a film coated tablet and the<br>
materials used in this instance are divided into 2 groups. The first are the nonenteric materials and<br>
include methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxy-ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose, sodium carboxy-methyl cellulose, providone<br>
and the polyethylene glycols. The second group consists of the enteric materials that are commonly esters<br>
of phthalic acid.<br>
A mix of materials might be used to provide the optimum film coating. Film coating may be<br>
carried out in a pan coater or in a fluidized bed or by compression coating.<br>
Parenteral delivery<br>
Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable<br>
organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving,<br>
wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a<br>
bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the<br>
compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured using sterile water, or some<br>
other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use.<br><br>
Rectal or vaginal delivery<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain,<br>
in addition to the active substance, excipients such as cocoa butter or a suppository wax. Compositions<br>
for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art.<br>
Pulmonary Deliveiy<br>
Also contemplated herein is pulmonary deliveiy of the EPO-R agonist peptides (or derivatives<br>
thereof). The peptide (or derivative) is delivered to the lungs of a mammal while inhaling and traverses<br>
across the lung epithelial lining to the blood stream [see, e.g., Adjei, et al. (1990) Pharmaceutical<br>
Research 7:565-569; Adjei, et al. (1990) Int. J. Pharmaceutics 63:135-144 (leuprolide acetate); Braquet, et<br>
al. (1989) X Cardiovascular Pharmacology 13(sup5): 143-146 (endothelin-1); Hubbard, et al. (1989)<br>
Annals of Internal Medicine, Vol. m, pp. 206-212 (α1-antitrypsin); Smith, et al. (1989) J. Clin. Invest.<br>
84:1145-1146 (α-1-proteinase); Oswein, et al. (1990) "Aerosolization of Proteins", Proceedings of<br>
Symposium on Respiratory Drug Delivery II Keystone, Colorado (recombinant human growth hormone);<br>
Debs, et al. (1988) J. Immunol. 140:3482-3488 (interferon-y and tumor necrosis factor a); and U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,284,656 to Platz, et al. (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). A method and composition for<br>
pulmonary delivery of drugs for S3'stemic effect is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,569 to Wong, et al.<br>
Contemplated for use in the practice of this invention are a wide range of mechanical deAdces<br>
designed for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic products, including but not limited to nebulizers, metered<br>
dose inhalers, and powder inhalers, all of which are familiar to those skilled in the art. Some specific<br>
examples of commercially available devices suitable for the practice of this invention are the Ultravent<br>
nebulizer (Mallinckrodt Inc., St. Louis, MO); the Acorn II nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products,<br>
Englewood, CO); the Ventolin metered dose inhaler (Glaxo Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC); and the<br>
Spinhaler powder inhaler (Fisons Corp., Bedford, MA).<br>
All such devices require the use of formulations suitable for the dispensing of peptide (or<br>
derivative). Typically, each formulation is specific to the type of device employed and may involve the<br>
use of an appropriate propellant material, in addition to the usual diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers useful<br>
in therapy. Also, the use of liposomes, microcapsules or microspheres, inclusion complexes, or other<br>
types of carriers is contemplated. Chemically modified peptides may also be prepared in different<br>
formulations depending on the type of chemical modification or the type of device employed.<br>
Formulations suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, will typically comprise<br>
peptide (or derivative) dissolved in water at a concentration of about 0.1 to 25 mg of biologically active<br>
protein per mL of solution. The formulation may also include a buffer and a simple sugar (e.g., for<br>
protein stabilization and regulation of osmotic pressure). The nebulizer formulation may also contain a<br><br>
surfactant, to reduce or prevent surface induced aggregation of the peptide (or derivative) caused by<br>
atomization of the solution in forming the aerosol.<br>
Formulations for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally cornprise a finely divided<br>
powder containing the peptide (or derivative) suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The<br>
propellant may be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, a<br>
hydrochlorofiuorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafiuoroethane, or combinations<br>
thereof. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate and soya lecithin. Oleic acid may also be useful as<br>
a surfactant.<br>
Formulations for dispensing from a powder inhaler device will comprise a finely divided dry<br>
powder containing peptide (or derivative) and may also include a bulking agent, such as lactose, sorbitol,<br>
sucrose, or mannitol in amounts which facilitate dispersal of the powder from the device, e.g., 50 to 90%<br>
by weight of the formulation. The peptide (or derivative) should most advantageously be prepared in<br>
particulate form with an average particle size of less than 10 mm (or microns), most preferably 0.5 to 5<br>
mm, for most effective delivery to the distal lung.<br>
Nasal Delivery<br>
Nasal delivery of the EPO-R agonist peptides (or derivatives) is also contemplated. Nasal<br>
delivery allows the passage of the peptide to the blood stream directly after administering the therapeutic<br>
product to the nose, without the necessity for deposition of the product in the lung. Formulations for<br>
nasal delivery include those with dextran or cyclodextran.<br>
Dosages<br>
For all of the peptide compounds, as further studies are conducted, information will emerge<br>
regarding appropriate dosage levels for treatment of various conditions in various patients, and the<br>
ordinary skilled worker, considering the therapeutic context, age, and general health of the recipient, will<br>
be able to ascertain proper dosing. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on<br>
the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment desired. Generally dosage levels of 0.001<br>
to 10 mg/kg of body weight daily are administered to mammals. Generally, for intravenous injection or<br>
infusion dosage may be lower. The dosing schedule may vary, depending on the circulation half-life, and<br>
the formulation used.<br>
The peptides of the present invention (or their derivatives) may be administered in conjunction<br>
with one or more additional active ingredients or pharmaceutical compositions.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The present invention is next described by means of the following examples. However, the use of<br>
these and other examples anywhere in the specification is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope<br>
and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified form. Likewise, the invention is not limited to any<br>
particular preferred embodiments described herein. Indeed, many modifications and variations of the<br>
invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading this specification, and can be made<br>
without departing from its spirit and scope. The invention is therefore to be limited only by the terms of<br>
the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which the claims are entitled.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of EPO-R agonist peptides<br>
1. Peptide Monomer Synthesis<br>
Various peptide monomers of the invention were synthesized using the Merrifield solid phase<br>
synthesis technique [see, Stewart and Young. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd edition (Pierce Chemical,<br>
Rockford, IL) 1984] on an Applied Biosystems 433A automated instrument. The resin used was PAL<br>
(Milligen/Biosearch), which is cross-linked polystyrene with 5-(4'-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3,5'-<br>
dimethoxyphenoxy) valeric acid. Use of PAL resin results in a carboxyl terminal amide function upon<br>
cleavage of the peptide from the resin. Primary amine protection on amino acids was achieved with<br>
Fmoc, and side chain protection groups were t-butyl for serine, threonine, and tyrosine hydroxyls; trityl<br>
for glutamine and asparagine amides; Trt or Acm for cysteine; and Pmc (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman<br>
sulfonate) for the arginine guanidino group. Each coupling was performed for either 1 hr or 2 hr with<br>
BOP (benzotriazolyl N-oxtrisdimethylaminophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) and HOBt C<br>
hydroxybenztriazole).<br>
For the synthesis of peptides with an amidated carboxy terminus, the fully assembled peptide was<br>
cleaved with a mixture of 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ethanedithiol, and 5% water, initially at 4°C and<br>
gradually increasing to room temperature over 1.5 hr. The deprotected product was filtered from the resin<br>
and precipitated with diethyl ether. After thorough drying the product was purified by C18 reverse phase<br>
high performance liquid chromatography with a gradient of acetonitrile/water in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
2. Peptide Dimer Synthesis<br>
Various peptide dimers of the invention were synthesized directly onto a lysine linker in a<br>
variation of the solid phase technique.<br>
For simultaneous synthesis of the two peptide chains, Fmoc-Lys-Fmoc was coupled to a PAL<br>
resin (Milligen/Biosearch), thereby providing an initial lysine residue to serve as the linker between the<br>
two chains to be synthesized. The Fmoc protecting groups were removed with mild base (20% piperidine<br><br>
in DMF), and the peptide chains were synthesized using the resulting free amino groups as starting points.<br>
Peptide chain synthesis was performed using the solid phase synthesis technique described above. Trt<br>
was used to protect all cysteine residues. Following dimer deprotection, cleavage from the resin, and<br>
purification, oxidation of the cysteine residues was performed by incubating the deprotected dimer in<br>
100% DMSO for 2-3 days at 5°C to 25°C. This oxidation reaction yielded predominantly (&gt;75%) dimers<br>
with two intramolecular disulfide bonds.<br>
For sequential synthesis of the two peptide chains, Fmoc-Lys-Alloc was coupled to a PAL resin<br>
(Milligen/Biosearch), thereby providing an initial lysine residue to serve as the linker between the two<br>
chains to be synthesized. The Fmoc protecting group was removed with mild base (20% piperidine in<br>
DMF). The first peptide chain was then syntheszed using the resulting free amino group as a starting<br>
point. Peptide synthesis was performed using the solid phase technique described above. The two<br>
cysteine residues of the first chain were protected with Trt. Following synthesis of the first peptide chain,<br>
the Alloc group was removed from the support-bound lysine linker with Pd[P(C2H5)3]4, 4-methyl<br>
morpholine, and chloroform The second peptide chain was then synthesized on this second free amino<br>
group. The two cysteine residues of the second chain were protected with Acm. An intramolecular<br>
disulfide bond was formed in the first peptide chain by removing the Trt protecting groups using<br>
trifiuoroacetic acid, followed by oxidation by stirring in 20% DMSO overnight. An intramolecular<br>
disulfide bond was then formed in the second peptide chain by simultaneously removing the Acm<br>
protecting groups and oxidizing the deprotected cysteine residues using iodine, methanol, and thalium<br>
trifluoroacetate.<br>
3.	Attachment of spacers<br>
Where the spacer was an amino acid (e.g., glycine or lysine as in AF35462 and AF35464,<br>
respectively), the spacer was incorporated into the peptide during solid phase peptide synthesis. In this<br>
case, the spacer amino acid was coupled to the PAL resin, and its free amino group served as the basis for<br>
the attachment of another spacer amino acid, or of the lysine linker. Following the attachment of the<br>
lysine linker, dimeric peptides were synthesized as described above.<br>
4.	Synthesis of exemplary peptide dimers<br>
Exemplary embodiments of these synthesis techniques are outlined below. In one example, the synthesis of<br>
a peptide dimer linked via a C-terminal lysine amide is described. In another example, the synthesis of a peptide<br>
dimer linked via a C-terminal lysine, and containing a spacer molecule attached to the linking lysine, is described.<br>
Synthesis of a peptide dimer linked via a C-terminal lysine amide:<br><br>
Step 1 - Formation of TentaGel-Rink-Lys: TentaGel-Rink resin (0.18 mml/g from Rapp Polymere,<br>
Germany) was treated with a activated solution of Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH (prepared from 5 eq. of amino<br>
acid and 5 eq.of HATU dissolved at 0.5 M in DMF, followed by the addition of 10 eq. of DIEA) and<br>
allowed to gently shake 14h. The resin was washed (DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and dried to yield the<br>
protected resin. Residual amine groups were capped by treating the resin with a solution of 10% acetic<br>
anhydride, 20% pyridine in DCM for 20 minutes, followed by washing as above. The Fmoc groups were<br>
removed by gently shaking the resin in 30% piperideine in DMF for 20 minutes, followed by washing<br>
(DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and drying.<br><br>
Step 2 - Formation of TentaGel-Rink-Lys(Peptide)2: The resin from Step 1 was subjected to<br>
repeated cycles of Fmoc-amino acid couplings with HBTU/HOBt activation and Fmoc removal with<br>
piperidine to build both peptide chains simultaneously. This was convenently carried out on a ABI433<br>
automated peptide synthesizer available from Applied Biosystems, Inc. After the final Fmoc removal, the<br>
terminal amine groups were acylated with acetic anhydride (10 eq.) and DIEA (20 eq.) in DMF for 20<br>
minutes, follwed by washing as above.<br><br>
Step 3 - Cleavage from resin: The resin from above is suspended in to a solution of TFA<br>
(82.5%), phenol (5%), ethanedithiol (2.5%), water (5%), and thioanisole (5%) for 3h at room temperature.<br>
Alternative cleavage cocktails such as TFA (95%), water (2.5%), and triisopropylsilane (2.5%) can also<br>
be used. The TFA solution is cooled to 5 °C and poured into Et2O to percipatate the peptide. Filtration<br>
and drying under reduced pressure gave the desired peptide. Purification via preparative HPLC with a<br>
C18 column affords the pure peptide.<br><br><br>
Synthesis of a peptide dimer linked via a C-terminal lysine amide and containing a spacer molecule:<br>
Step 1 - Synthesis of Cbz-TAP: A solution containing the commercially available diamine<br>
("TAP" from Aldrich Chemical Co.) (10g, 67.47mmol) in anhydrous DCM (100 ml) was cooled to 0°C.<br>
A solution of benzyl chloroformate (4.82ml, 33.7mmol) in anhydrous DCM (50ml) was added slowly<br>
through a dropping funnel over a period of 6-7 h, maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at<br>
0°C throughout, then allowed to warm to room temperature (~25°C). After a further 16h, the DCM was<br>
removed under vacuum and the residue partitioned between 3N HC1 and ether. The aqueous layers were<br>
collected and neutralized with 50% aq. NaOH to pH8-9 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl<br>
acetate layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, then concentrated under vacuum to provide the crude<br>
mono-Cbz-TAP (5g, about 50% yield). This compound was used for the next reaction without any<br>
further purification.<br><br>
Step 2 - Synthesis of Cbz-TAP-Boc: To a vigorously stirred suspension of the Cbz-TAP (5g,<br>
17.7mmol) in hexane (25ml) was added Boc2O (3.86g, 17.7mmol) and stirring continued at RT overnight.<br>
The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (25ml) and washed with 10% aq. citric acid (2X), water (2X)<br>
and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The<br>
crude product (yield 5g) was used directly in the next reaction.<br><br><br>
Step3 - Synthesis of Boc-TAP: The crude product from the previous reaction was dissolved in<br>
methanol (25ml) and hydrogenated in presence of 5% Pd on Carbon (5% w/W) under balloon pressure for<br>
16 hrs. The mixture was filtered, washed with methanol and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to provide<br>
the crude H-TAP-Boc product (yield 3.7g). The overall approximate yield of Boc-TAP after Steps 1-3<br>
was 44% (calculated based on the amount of Cbz-Cl used.)<br><br>
Step 4 - Synthesis of TentaGel-Linker: TentaGel bromide (2.5 g, 0.48 mmol/g, from Rapp<br>
Polymere, Germany), phenolic linker (5 equivalent, and K2CO3 (5 equivalent) were heated in 20 mL of<br>
DMFto 70°C for 14h. After cooling to room temperature, the resin was washed (0.1 N HCl, water, ACN,<br>
DMF, MeOH) and dried to give an amber-colored resin.<br><br>
Step 5 - Synthesis of TentaGel-linker-TAP(Boc): 2.5 gms of the resin from above and H-TAP-<br>
Boc (1.5gms, 5eq.) and glacial AcOH (34 µl, 5 eq.) was taken in a mixture of 1:1 MeOH-THF and shaken<br>
overnight. A 1M solution of sodium cyanoborohydride (5eq) in THF was added to this and shaken for<br>
another 7hrs. The resin was filtered washed (DMF, THF, 0.1 N HCl, water, MeOH) and dried. A small<br>
amount of the resin was benzoylated with Bz-Cl and DIEA in DCM and cleaved with 70% TFA-DCM<br>
and checked by LCMS and HPLC.<br><br>
Step 6 - Synthesis of TentaGel-linker-TAP-Lys: The resin from above was treated with a<br>
activated solution of Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH (prepared from 5 eq. of amino acid and 5 eq.of HATU<br>
dissolved at 0.5 M in DMF, followed by the addition of 10 eq. of DIEA) and allowed to gently shake 14h.<br><br>
The resin was washed (DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and dried to yield the protected resin. Residual amine<br>
'groups were capped by treating the resin with a solution of 10% acetic anhydride, 20% pyridine in DCM<br>
for 20 minutes, followed by washing as above. The Fmoc groups are removed by gently shaking the resin<br>
in 30% piperideine in DMF for 20 minutes, followed by washing (DMF, THF, DCM, MeOH) and drying.<br>
Step 7-Synthesis of TentaGel-Linker-TAP-Lys(Peptide)2: The resin from above was<br>
subjected to repeated cycles of Fmoc-amino acid couplings with HBTU/HOBt activation and Fmoc<br>
removal with piperidine to build both peptide chains simultaneously. This was convenently carried out<br>
on a ABI 433 automated peptide synthesizer available from Applied Biosystems, Inc. After the final<br>
Fmoc removal, the terminal amine groups were acylated with acetic anhydride (10 eq.) and DEEA (20 eq.)<br>
in DMF for 20 minutes, follwed by washing as above.<br><br>
Step 8 - Cleavage from resin: The resin from above was suspended in a solution of TFA<br>
(82.5%), phenol (5%), ethanedithiol (2.5%), water (5%), and thioanisole (5%) for 3h at room temperature.<br>
Alternative cleavage cocktails such as TFA (95%), water (2.5%), and triisopropylsilane (2.5%) can also<br>
be used. The TFA solution was cooled to 5 °C and poured into Et2O to percipatate the peptide. Filtration<br>
and drying under reduced pressure gave the desired peptide. Purification via preparative HPLC with a<br>
C18 column afforded the pure peptide.<br><br><br>
5. Oxidation of peptides to form intramolecular disulfide bonds<br>
The peptide dimer was dissolved in 20% DMSO/water (1 mg dry weight peptide/mL) and<br>
allowed to stand at room temperature for 36h. The peptide was purified by loading the reaction mixture<br>
onto a C18 HPLC column (Waters Delta-Pale C18, 15 micron particle size, 300 angstrom pore size, 40<br>
mm x 200 mm length), followed by a linear ACN/water/0.01% TFA gradiant from 5 to 95% ACN over<br>
40 minutes. Lyopholization of the fractions containing the desired peptide affords the product as a fluffy<br>
white solid. For example, in the case of AF35525, this reaction may be illustrated schematically as<br>
follows:<br><br>
Dimeric peptide (XYZ) containing	Dimeric peptide (XYZ) containing<br>
reduced cysteine residues	oxidized disulfide bonds<br>
6. PEGylation of peptides<br>
PEGylation of the peptides of the invention was carried out using several different techniques.<br>
PEGylation of a terminal -NH2 group: The peptide dimer was mixed with 1.5 eq. (mole basis)<br>
of activated PEG species (mPEG-NPC from NOF Corp. Japan) in dry DMF to afford a clear solution.<br>
After 5 minutes 4eq of DIEA was added to above solution. The mixture was stirred at ambient<br>
temperature 14h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The structure of PEGylated<br>
peptide was confirmed by MALDI mass. The purified peptide was also subjected to purification via<br>
cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. For example, in the case of AF35593, the<br>
monoPEGylation of the terminal -NH2 group of the spacer moiety may be illustrated schematically as<br>
follows:<br><br><br>
DiPEGylation of the N-termini of a peptide dimer: The peptide dimer is mixed with 2.5 eq.<br>
"(mole basis) of activated PEG species (mPEG-NPC from NOF Corp. Japan) in dry DMF to afford a clear<br>
solution. After 5 minutes 4eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient<br>
temperature 14h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The purified peptide is also<br>
subjected to purification via cation.ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. For example, in the<br>
case of AF35083, this reaction may be illustrated schematically as follows:<br>
Peptide dimerization via PEGylation of N-termini: The peptide (2.5 eq.) and PEG-(SPA-NHS)2<br>
(1 eq. from Shearwater Corp, USA.) were dissolved in dry DMF at 0.25M to afford a clear solution.<br>
After 5 minutes 10eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature<br>
2b, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The purified peptide is also subjected to<br>
purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. For example, in the case of<br>
AF33131, this reaction may be illustrated schematically as follows:<br><br><br>
Peptide dimerization via PEGylation of C-termini: The peptide (2.5 eq.) and PEG-(SPA-NHS)2<br>
(1 eq. from Shearwater Corp, USA.) were dissolved in dry DMF at 0.25M to afford a clear solution.<br>
After 5 minutes 10eq of DIEA is added to above solution. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature<br>
2h, followed by purification with C18 reverse phase HPLC. The purified peptide is also subjected to<br>
purification via cation ion exchange chromatography as outlined below. For example, this reaction may<br>
be summarized as follows: •<br><br>
7. Ion exchange purification of peptides.<br>
Several exchange supports were surveyed for their ability to separate the above peptide-PEG<br>
conjugate from unreacted (or hydrolyzed) PEG, in addition to their ability to retain the starting dimeric<br>
peptides. The ion exchange resin (2-3g) was loaded into a 1 cm column, followed by conversion to the<br>
sodium form (0.2 N NaOH loaded onto column until elutant was pH 14, ca. 5 column volumes), and than<br>
to the hydrogen form (eluted with either 0.1 N HCl or 0.1 M HOAc until elutant matched load pH, ca. 5<br>
column volumes), followed by washing with 25% ACN/water until pH 6. Either the peptide prior to<br>
conjugation or the peptide-PEG conjugate was dissolved in 25% ACN/water (10 mg/mL) and the pH<br>
adjusted to 
ACN/water and collecting 5 mL fractions, the peptide was released from the column by elution with 0.1<br>
M NRtOAc in 25% ACN/water, again collecting 5 mL fractions. Analysis via HPLC revealed which<br>
fractions contained the desired peptide. Analysis with an Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector (ELSD)<br>
indicated that when the peptide was retained on the column and was eluted with the NH4OAc solution<br><br>
(generally between fractions 4 and 10), no non-conjugated PEG was observed as a contaminant. When<br>
the peptide eluted in the initial wash buffer (generally the first 2 fractions), no separation of desired PEG-<br>
conjugate and excess PEG was observed.<br>
The following columns successfully retained both the peptide and the peptide-PEG conjugate,<br>
and successfully purified the peptide-PEG conjugate from the unconjugates peptide:<br><br>
This example describes various in vitro assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. The results for these assays demonstrate that the<br>
novel peptides of this invention bind to EPO-R and activate EPO-R signaling. Moreover, the results for<br>
these assays show that the novel peptide compositions exhibit a surprising increase in EPO-R binding<br>
affinity and biological activity compared to EPO mimetic peptides that have been previously described.<br>
EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are prepared1 according to the methods provided in<br>
Example 1. The potency of these peptide monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series of in vitro<br>
activity assays, including: a reporter assay, a proliferation assay, a. competitive binding assay, and a<br>
C/BFU-e assay. These four assays are described in further detail below.<br>
The results of these in vitro activity assays are summarized in Table 2 (for peptide monomers)<br>
and Table 3 (for peptide dimers). These tables provide the compound designation and structure for each<br>
tested peptide, as well as the experimental results for each of these four assays. These results demonstrate<br>
the dramatically enhanced potency of the novel peptides of the invention.<br>
1. Reporter assay<br>
This assay is based upon a on a murine pre-B-cell line derived reporter cell, Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR<br>
fos/lux. This reporter cell line expresses a chimeric receptor comprising the extra-cellular portion of the<br>
human EPO receptor to the intra-cellular portion of the human GCSF receptor. This cell line is further<br>
transfected with a fos promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene construct. Activation of this chimeric<br>
receptor through addition of erythropoietic agent results in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene,<br><br>
and therefore the production of light upon addition of the luciferase substrate luciferin. Thus, the level of<br>
EPO-R activation in such cells may be quantitated via measurement of luciferase activity.<br>
The Baf3/EpoR/GCSFR fos/lux cells are cultured in DMEM/F12 medium^ (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 10% WEHI-3 supernatant (the supernatant from a culture<br>
of WEHI-3 cells, ATCC # TIB-68), and penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 18 h before the assay,<br>
cells are starved by transferring them to DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1%<br>
WEHI-3 supernatant. On the day of assay, cells are washed once with DMEM/F12 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant), then 1 X 106 cells/mL are cultured in the<br>
presence of a known concentration of test peptide, or with EPO (R&amp;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN)<br>
as a positive control, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant).<br>
Serial dilutions of the test peptide are concurrently tested in this assay. Assay plates are incubated for 4h<br>
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which luciferin (Steady-Glo; Promega, Madison, Wi) is added to<br>
each well. Following a 5-minute incubation, light emission is measured on a Packard Topcount<br>
Luminometer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, 111.). Light counts are plotted relative to test<br>
peptide concentration and analysed using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a half-maximal emission of light is recorded as the EC50 [See Tables 2 and 3: Reporter EC50].<br>
2. Proliferation assay<br>
This assay is based upon a murine pre-B-cell line, Baf3, transfected to express human EPO-R.<br>
Proliferation of the resulting cell line, BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR, is dependent on EPO-R activation. The<br>
degree of cell proliferation is quantitated using MTT, where the signal in the MTT assay is proportional to<br>
the number of viable cells.<br>
The BaF3/Gal4/Elk/EPOR cells are cultured in spinner flasks in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco)<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and 2% WEHI-3 supernatant (ATCC # TIB-68). Cultured cells<br>
are starved overnight, in a spinner flask at a cell density of 1x106 cells/ml, in DMEM/F12 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% WEHI-3 supernatant. The starved cells are then washed twice<br>
with Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco), and resuspended to a density of 1x106 cells/ml in DMEM/F12<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant). 50µL aliquots (~50,000 cells) of the cell<br>
suspension are then plated, in triplicate, in 96 well assay plates. 50µL aliquots of dilution series of test<br>
EPO mimetic peptides, or 50µL EPO (R &amp; D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or Aranesp™<br>
(darbepoeitin alpha, an ERO-R agonist commerically available from Amgen) in DMEM7F12 media<br>
supplemented with 10% FBS (no WEHI-3 supernatant D are added to the 96 well assay plates (final well<br>
volume of 100µL). For example, 12 different dilutions may be tested where the final concentration of test<br>
peptide (or control EPO peptide) ranges from 810pM to 0.0045pM. The plated cells are then incubated<br><br>
for 48h at 37°C. Next, 10µL of MTT (Roche Diagnostics) is added to each culture dish well, and then<br>
allowed to incubate for 4h. The reaction is then stopped by adding 10% SDS + 0.01N HCl. The plates<br>
are then incubated overnight at 37°C. Absorbance of each well at a wavelezight of 595nm is then<br>
measured by spectrophotometry. Plots of the absorbance readings versus test peptide concentration are<br>
constructed and the EC50 calculated using Graph Pad software. The concentration of test peptide that<br>
results in a half-maximal absorbance is recorded as the EC50 [See Table 3: Proliferation EC50].<br>
3. Competitive Binding Assay<br>
Competitive binding calculations are made using an assay in which a light signal is generated as a<br>
function of the proximity of two beads: a streptavidin donor bead bearing a biotinylated EPO-R-binding<br>
peptide tracer and an acceptor bead to which is bound EPO-R. Light is generated by non-radiative energy<br>
transfer, during which a singlet oxygen is released from a first bead upon illumination, and contact with<br>
the released singlet oxygen causes the second bead to emit light. These bead sets are commercially<br>
available (Packard). Bead proximity is generated by the binding of the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer to<br>
the EPO-R. A test peptide that competes with the EPO-R-binding peptide tracer for binding to EPO-R<br>
will prevent this binding, causing a decrease in light emission.<br>
In more detail the method is as follows: Add 4µL of serial dilutions of the test EPO-R agonist<br>
peptide, or positive or negative controls, to wells of a 384 well plate. Thereafter, add 2µL / well of<br>
receptor/bead cocktail. Receptor bead cocktail consists of: 15µL of 5mg/ml streptavidin donor beads<br>
(Packard), 15µL of 5mg/ml monoclonal antibody ab179 (this antibody recognizes the portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein contained in the recombinant EPO-R), protein A-coated<br>
acceptor beads (protein A will bind to the abl79 antibody; Packard), 112.5µL of a 1:6.6 dilution of<br>
recombinant EPO-R (produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells as a fusion protein to a portion of the<br>
human placental alkaline phosphatase protein which contains the abl79 target epitope) and 607.5 µL of<br>
Alphaquest buffer (40mM HEPES, pH 7.4; ImM MgCl2; 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). Tap to mix.<br>
Add 2µL/well of the biotinylated EPO-R-binding peptide tracer, AP33068 (30nM final concentration).<br>
AF33068, an EPO-R binding peptide (see Table 3 "Reporter EC50 (pM)"), is made according to the<br>
methods described in Example 1.<br><br><br>
Centrifuge 1 min to mix. Seal plate with Packard Top Seal and wrap in foil. Incubate overnight<br>
at room temperature. After 18 hours read light emission using an AlphaQuest reader (Packard). Plot light<br>
emission vs concentration of peptide and analyse with Graph Pad or Excel.<br>
The concentration of test peptide that results in a 50% decrease in light emission, relative to that<br>
observed without test peptide, is recorded as the IC50 [See Tables 2 and 3: AQ IC50].<br>
4. C/BFU-e Assay<br>
EPO-R signaling stimulates the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into proliferating red<br>
blood cell presursors. This assay measures the ability of test peptides to stimulate the proliferation and<br>
differentiation of red blood cell precursors from primary human bone marrow pluripotent stem cells.<br>
For this assay, serial dilutions of test peptide are made in IMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented<br>
with 10% FBS (Hyclone). These serial dilutions, or positive control EPO peptide, are then added to<br>
methylcellulose to give a final volume of 1.5mL. The methylcellulose and peptide mixture is then<br>
vortexed thoroughly. Aliquots (100,000 cells/mL) of human, bone marrow derived CD34+ cells<br>
(Poietics/Cambrex) are thawed. The thawed cells are gently added to 0.1 mL of 1mg/ml DNAse (Stem<br>
Cells) in a 50mL tube. Next, 40-50 mL IMDM medium is added gently to cells: the medium is added<br>
drop by drop along the side of the 50mL tube for the first 10mL, and then the remaining volume of<br>
medium is slowly dispensed along the side of the tube. The cells are then spun at 900rpm for 20 min, and<br>
the media removed carefully by gentle aspiration. The cells are resuspended in 1ml of IMDM medium<br>
and the cell density per mL is counted on hemacytometer slide (10µL aliquot of cell suspension on slide,<br>
and cell density is the average count X 10,000 cells/ml). The cells are then diluted in IMDM medium to<br>
a cell density of 15,000 cells/mL. A 100µL of diluted cells is then added to each 1.5 mL methyl cellulose<br>
plus peptide sample (final cell concentration in assay media is 1000 cells/ mL), and the mixture is<br>
vortexed. Allow the bubbles in the mixture to disappear, and then aspirate 1mL using blunt-end needle.<br>
Add 0.25 mL aspirated mixture from each sample into each of 4 wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon brand).<br>
Incubate the plated mixtures at 37°C under 5% CO2 in a humid incubator for 14 days. Score for the<br>
presence of erythroid colonies using a phase microscope (5X-10X objective, final magnification of<br>
100X). The concentration of test peptide at which the numer of formed colonies is 90% of maximum,<br>
relative to that observed with the EPO positive control, is recorded as the EC90 [See Table 3: C/BFU-e<br>
EC90].<br>
5. Radioligand Competitive Binding Assay<br><br>
An alternative radioligand competition binding assay can also be used to measure IC50 values for<br>
peptides of the present invention. This assay measures binding of 125I-EPO to EPOr. The assay may be<br>
performed according to the following exemplary protocol:<br>
A. Materials<br><br>
B.	Determination of appropriate receptor concentration.<br>
One 50 µg vial of lyophilized recombinant EPOr extracellular domain fused to the Fc portion of<br>
human IgG1 is reconstituted in 1 mL of assay buffer. To determine the correct amount of receptor to use<br>
in the assay, 100 µL serial dilutions of this receptor preparation are combined with approximately 20,000<br>
cpm in 200 µL of iodinated recombinant human Erythropoietin (125I-EPO) in 12 x 75 mm polypropylene<br>
test tubes. Tubes are capped and mixed gently at 4 °C overnight on a LabQuake rotating shaker.<br>
The next day, 50 µL of a 50 % slurry of Protein-G Sepharose is added to each tube. Tubes are<br>
then incubated for 2 hours at 4 °C, mixing gently. The tubes are then centrifuged for 15 min at 4000<br>
RPM (3297 x G) to pellet the protein-G sepharose. The supernatants are carefully removed and<br>
discarded. After washing 3 times with 1 mL of 4 °C assay buffer, the pellets are counted in a Wallac<br>
Wizard gamma counter. Results were then analyzed and the dilution required to reach 50 % of the<br>
maximum binding value was calculated.<br>
C.	IC50 Determination for peptide<br>
To determine the IC50 of a peptide of the present invention, 100 µL serial dilutions of the peptide<br>
are combined with 100 µL of recombinant erythropoietin receptor (100 pg/tube) in 12 x 75 mm<br><br>
polypropylene test tubes. Then 100 pX of iodinated recombinant human Erythropoietin (125I-EPO) is<br>
added to each tube and the tubes were capped and mixed gently at 4°C overnight.<br>
The next day, bound 125I-EPO is quantitated as described above. The results are analyzed and the<br>
IC50 value calculated using Graphpad Prism version 4.0, from GraphPad Software, Inc. (San Diego, CA)<br>
The assay is preferably repeated 2 or more times for each peptide whose IC50 value is measured by this<br>
procedure, for a total of 3 replicate IC50 determinations.<br>
6. Discussion<br>
The in vitro reporter assay results for peptide monomers of the present invention were directly<br>
compared with those for related peptide sequences previously disclosed (see AF31552 and AF31748 in<br>
Table 2): namely,<br>
GGLYACHMGPMTVCQPLRG	SEQ ID NO: 32 and<br>
GGLYACHMGPMT(1-nal)VCQPLRG	SEQ ID NO: 33.<br>
These results demonstrate the dramatically improved potency of the novel peptide monomers of<br>
the invention, as the novel peptide dimers were 3 to 7.5 times as potent as the previously disclosed<br>
peptide monomers in the reporter assay. These novel peptide monomers were then used to prepare novel<br>
peptide dimers of even greater potency and activity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 3: In vivo activity assays<br>
This example describes various in vivo assays that are useful in evaluating the activity and<br>
potency of EPO-R agonist peptides of the invention. EPO-R agonist peptide monomers and dimers are<br>
prepared according to the methods provided in Example 1. The in vivo activity of these peptide<br>
monomers and dimers is evaluated using a series assays, including a polycythemic exhypoxic mouse<br>
bioassay and a reticulocyte assay. These two assays are described in further detail below.<br>
1. Polycythemic Exhypoxic Mouse Bioassay<br>
Test peptides are assayed for in vivo activity in the polycythemic exhypoxic mouse bioassay<br>
adapted from the method described by Cotes and Bangham (1961), Nature 191: 1065-1067. This assay<br>
examines the ability of a test peptide to function as an EPO mimetic: i.e., to activate EPO-R and induce<br>
new red blood cell synthesis. Red blood cell synthesis is quantitated based upon incorporation of<br>
radiolabeled iron into hemoglobin of the synthesized red blood cells.<br>
BDF1 mice are allowed to acclimate to ambient conditions for 7-10 days. Body weights are<br>
determined for all animals, and low weight animals (
successive conditioning cycles in a hypobaric chamber for a total of 14 days. Each 24 hour cycle consista<br>
of 18 hr at 0.40±0.02% atmospheric pressure and 6 hr at ambient pressure. After conditioning the mice<br>
are maintained at ambient pressure for an additional 72 hr prior to dosing.<br>
Test peptides, or recombinant human EPO standards, are diluted in PBS + 0.1% BSA vehicle<br>
(PBS/BSA). Peptide monomer stock solutions are first solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).<br>
Negative control groups include one group of mice injected with PBS/BSA alone, and one group injected<br>
with 1% DMSO. Each dose group containa 10 mice. Mice are injected subcutaneously (scruff of neck)<br>
with 0.5 mL of the appropriate sample.<br>
Forty eight hours following sample injection, the mice are administered an intraperitoneal<br>
injection of 0.2 ml of Fe59 (Dupont, NEN), for a dose of approximately 0.75 µCuries/mouse. Mouse body<br>
weights are determined 24hr after Fe59 administration, and the mice are sacrificed 48hr after Fe59<br>
administration. Blood is collected from each animal by cardiac puncture and hematocrits are determined<br>
(heparin was used as the anticoagulant). Each blood sample (0.2 ml) is analyzed for Fe59 incorporation<br>
using a Packard gamma counter. Non-responder mice (i.e., those mice with radioactive incorporation less<br>
than the negative control group) are eliminated from the appropriate data set. Mice that have hematocrit<br>
values less than 53% of the negative control group are also eliminated.<br>
Results are derived from sets of 10 animals for each experimental dose. The average amount of<br>
radioactivity incorporated [counts per minute (CPM)] into blood samples, from each group is calculated.<br><br>
2. Reticulocyte Assay<br>
Normal BDF1 mice are dosed (0.5 mL, injected subcutaneously) on three consecutive days with<br>
either EPO control or test peptide. At day three, mice are also dosed (0.1 mL, injected intraperitoneally)<br>
with iron dextran (100 mg/ml). At day five, mice are anesthetized with CO2 and bled by cardiac<br>
puncture. The percent (%) reticulocytes for each blood sample is determined by thiazole orange staining<br>
and flow cytometer analysis (retic-count program). Hematocrits are manually determined. The corrected<br>
percent of reticulocytes is determined using the following formula:<br>
% RETICCORRECTED = % RETICOBSERVED X (HematocritiINDIVIDUAL / HematocritNORMAL)<br>
3. Hematological Assay<br>
Normal CD1 mice are dosed with four weekly bolus intravenous injections of either EPO positive<br>
control, test peptide, or vehicle. A range of positive control and test peptide doses, expressed as mg/kg,<br>
are tested by varying the active compound concentration in the formulation. Volumes injected are<br>
5ml/kg. The vehicle control group is comprised twelve animals, while 8 animals are in each of the<br>
remaining dose groups. Daily viability and weekly body weights are recorded.<br>
The dosed mice are mice are fasted and then anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and terminal<br>
blood samples are collected via cardiac or abdominal aorta puncture on Day 1 (for vehicle control mice)<br>
and on Days 15 and 29 (4 mice/group/day). The blood is transferred to Vacutairier® brand tubes.<br>
Preferred anticoagulant is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).<br>
Blood samples are evaluated for endpoints measuring red blood synthesis and physiology such as<br>
hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hgb) and total erythrocyte count (RBC) using automated clinical analysers<br>
well known in the art (e.g., those made by Coulter, Inc.).<br>
Data for representative EPO-R agonist peptides in this assay are given in Table 4. Results are<br>
given as increase in percent (%) hematocrit (Ht), relative to vehicle injected control mice, at day 15 and at<br>
day 29. The indicated peptide compounds were administered to test mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg.<br><br><br><br>
