				<td>NOVEL PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF (E)-STILBENE DERIVATIVES WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN RESVERATROL AND PICEATANNOL<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is a novel process for the synthesis of (E)-stilbene derivatives targeted in particular at obtaining resveratrol and piceatannol.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a process for the synthesis of (E)-stilbene derivatives of fonnula (VI) as defined in the present patent application, in particular (E)-trimethylresveratrol, (E)-tribenzylresveratrol and (E)-tetramethylpiceatannol, which make it possible to obtain resveratrol and piceatannol.<br>
Polyhydroxystilbenes are compounds which are found in various plants and which have received particular attention as they exhibit a great variety of therapeutic properties.<br>
These derivatives include resveratrol ((E)-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and piceatannol ((E)-3,5,3\4'-tetrahydroxystilbene) of formulae:<br><br>
Resveratrol and piceatannol are compounds belonging to the class of the polyphenols, known for exerting antioxidant effects capable of preventing or delaying the deleterious effects of oxidative stress.<br>
In the therapeutic field, resveratrol is listed as platelet antiaggregant, anti-inflammatory or vasodilator or as cell proliferation inhibitor.<br>
These products have resulted in the development of numerous synthetic routes but the latter are not satisfactory from an industrial viewpoint.<br>
The synthetic routes envisaged require, in the majority of cases, the protection of the phenolic functional groups, either in the form of ether derivatives (generally methyl, isopropyl, benzyl or silyl derivatives) or in the form of ester derivatives (generally acetyl or benzoyl derivatives), and the polyhydroxystilbenes are subsequently obtained by release of the said functional groups by known methods.<br>
The most widely used route for obtaining resveratrol or piceatannol is described in numerous publications and patent applications, including the following: EP 1 466 884; WO 03/086414. It consists in condensing, according to "Wittig" or "Wittig-Horner" conditions, a protected hydroxyaromatic (or polyhydroxyaromatic) aldehyde, such as protected 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, with a phosphonium salt or a phosphonate, such as protected 4-hydroxybenzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide.<br>
However, Wittig or Wittig-Homer reactions generally result in a mixture of (E) and (Z)-stilbene isomers which are difficult to separate, which requires an additional stage in order to convert the undersirable Z isomer to the E isomer, either with catalytic iodine, as disclosed in US 04/0010, or else by reaction with a diaryl disulphide, as described in Chem. Pharm. Bull., (1992), 40(1O), 2842-2844. This additional stage results in such cases in the formation of by-products, which requires a difficult purification stage which is not very desirable industrially. The conversion of the Z isomer to the E isomer can be obtained by reaction of the Z isomer with a palladium(II) complex, as described in J. Org. Chem., (02), 67, 4627-4629. However, the large<br>
V       06FR306	<br>
amount of the said complex to be employed [ mol% of (MeCN)2 PdCl]2 renders the process very expensive.<br>
Another conventional route for obtaining resveratrol or piceatannol consists in obtaining 5      an a-phenylcinnamic acid by the Perkin reaction, as disclosed in WO 00/69430 and Tetrahedron, 59, (03), 33-21, by reacting a hydroxy- (or polyhydroxy)phenylacetic acid (or an ether/ester derivative) with a (protected or unprotected) hydroxy- (or polyhydroxy)aromatic aldehyde. The decarboxylation of the cinnamic derivative (Ou/quinoline at 260Â°C) then results in the stilbene derivative. <br>
However, the latter reaction requires severe conditions (high temperature, polluting metal catalyst) for the decarboxylation and generally results in the predominant (Z) isomer, which requires an additional isomerization stage.<br>
      Another route for the synthesis of resveratrol and piceatannol uses reactions of Heck<br>
type, such as the condensation of 3,5-diacetoxystyrene with 4-acetoxybromobenzene, as is disclosed in WO 05/023740, or else the condensation of 4-acetoxystyrene with 3,5-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride, as indicated in WO 01/60774, or else again the condensation with 3,5-diacetoxybenzoyl chloride disclosed in WO 05/069998.<br><br>
However, these reactions require the use of starting materials which are difficult to obtain, such as 3,5-diacetoxystyrene, and also catalysts based on palladium salts which are expensive and not very stable under the reaction conditions required, which result in low and variable yields.<br><br>
In order to solve the disadvantages of the abovementioned synthetic routes and to reduce the cost for the production of resveratrol and piceatannol, the inventors have developed an alternative route for the synthesis of polyhydroxystilbenes.<br>
30      This novel route consists in obtaining (E)-stilbene derivatives from 1,2-diarylethanone derivatives.<br><br>
The (E)-stilbene derivatives obtained are isomers of E type which are subsequently deprotected to give the products of interest, such as, for example resveratrol or piceatannol.<br>
This novel synthetic route exhibits the advantage, in addition to dispensing with the stage of separation of the E and Z isomers which presented a problem in the prior art, of using, as starting materials, 1,2-diarylethanone derivatives which can be obtained at low cost from reactants such as hydroxyaromatic acids, optionally etherified, and hydroxyaromatic esters.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the novel route for the synthesis of polyhydroxystilbenes disclosed in the present patent application.<br>
A first subject-matter of the present application is thus a process for the synthesis of an (E)-stilbene derivative of formula (VI)<br><br>
in which<br>
A represents hydrogen or an OR2 group, and<br>
R1 R2, R' 1 and R'2 represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched alkyl<br>
group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group including from 7 to 16<br>
carbon atoms which is optionally substituted by one or more alkoxy or halogen groups,<br>
it also being possible for R\ and R2 to form a hydrocarbon chain of structure -(CH2)n-<br>
with n= 1 to 3,<br>
characterized in that a 1,2-diarylethanone compound of formula (IV)<br><br>
in which<br>
A represents hydrogen or an OR2 group, and 5      R1 R2, R1  and R'2 represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched alkyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group including from 7 to 16 carbon atoms which is optionally substituted by one or more alkoxy or halogen groups, R1 it also being possible for and R2 to form a hydrocarbon chain of structure -(CH2)n-withn = 1 to 3;        s reacted as synthetic intermediate.<br>
in the present invention and what follows, where R1R2, R'1 and R'2 represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched alkyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, it is, for example, a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-      butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl group. When R1, R2, R'1 and R'2 represent an aralkyl group including from 7 to 16 carbon atoms, it is, for example, a benzyl, 1-phenylethyl, naphthylmethyl or 1-naphthylethyl group.<br>
In the present invention and in what follows, as regards the substituents, the term       "alkoxy" denotes, for example, a methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy radical.<br>
The halogen radical means CI, Br, F or I.<br>
A preferred aspect of the invention consists in synthesizing the following (E)-stilbene       derivatives of formula (VI):<br>
(E)-trimethylresveratrol, in which A represents a hydrogen atom, R1, R1 and R'2 being methyl groups or<br><br>
(E)-tribenzylresveratrol, in which A represents a hydrogen atom, R1, R1 and R'2 t&gt;eing benzyl groups, for the purpose of obtaining resveratrol, and<br>
(E)-tetramethylpiceatannol, in which A represents -OCH3, R1 R'1 and R'2 being<br>
5	methyl groups,<br>
for the purpose of obtaining piceatannol.<br>
Such products of formula (VI) are described in the literature.<br><br><br>
The intermediates of formula (IV), in which A represents hydrogen and R1, R'i and R'2 each represent a benzyl group or in which A represents an -OCH3 group and R1, R'i and R'2 each represent a methyl group or in which A represents hydrogen, R'i and R'2 represent a methyl group and R1 represents an isopropyl group or in which A represents an -OR2 group, R'i and R2 represent a methyl group and R1 and R2 form a hydrocarbon  structure-(CH2)n- with n = 1 are novel products which represent a further -matter of the invention.<br>
Those  novel compounds of formula (IV) consist in particular of the following:<br>
1 -(3,5-dibenzyloxyphenyl)-2-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethanone (or 3,5,4'-<br>
	tribenzyloxydeoxybenzoin);<br>
l-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanone (or 3,5,3',4'-<br>
tetramethoxydeoxybenzoin);<br>
l-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-isopropyloxyphenyl)ethanone, and<br>
1 -(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)ethanone       which are of use respectively in the manufacture of the following derivatives of formula (VI):<br>
(E)-tiibenzylresveratrol, which makes it possible, during the stage described later,<br>
to obtain resveratrol;<br>
(E)-tetramethylpiceatannol, which makes it possible, during the stage described<br>
30	later, to obtain piceatannol;<br>
(E)-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-isopropyloxy-stilbene, and<br>

The compound of formula (IV) can be used in two different ways to obtain the (E)-stilbene derivative of formula (VI) which is at the heart of the present invention:<br>
either by reducing the compound of formula (IV) to give an alcohol of formula<br>
(V) and by then dehydrating the alcohol formed (route A);       -        or by synthesis of arylsulphonylhydrazone compounds, by reacting the compound<br>
of formula (IV) with an arylsulphonylhydrazide, and by then reacting the<br>
arylsulphonylhydrazones formed with a base (route B).<br>

R is a linear or branched alkyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention and in what follows, when R represents a linear or branched alkyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, it is, for example, a methyl, ethyl, 5      propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl group.<br>
The reaction for the decarboxylation of the (3-ketoesters of formula (III) to give ketones of structure (IV) can be carried out under acidic conditions in the presence, for example, of acid/solvent pairs, such as the following concentrated hydrochloric acid/acetic acid,       concentrated hydrochloric acid/ethanol or sulphuric acid/acetic acid, or else without solvent, in the presence of boric acid or anhydride, as indicated in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 4th edition, page 629.<br>
      Preteribi;.  :hc decarboxylation reaction is carried out without solvent in the presence of 1 to 5 of boric acid or of boric anhydride at a temperature of between 0 and ' '
     The present invention provides, to this end, novel compounds of formula (III) in which R represents a methyl group, and<br>
either A represents hydrogen and the R1, R1 and R'2 groups represent methyl groups or benzyl groups,<br>
or A represents an -OCH3 group and the R1; R1 and R'2 groups each represent a methyl       group,<br>
or A represents hydrogen, R'1 and R'2 represent a methyl group and R1 represents an isopropyl group,<br>
or A represents an -OR2 group, R'1 and R'2 represent a methyl group and R1 and R2 form a hydrocarbon chain of structure-(CH2)n- with n = 1; 30      consisting in particular of the following compounds:<br>

methyl 3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-isopropyloxyphenyl)-3-oxopropionate;<br>
methyl 3-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-3-oxopropionate; which compounds make it possible to respectively obtain the following compounds of formula (IV): 5      -        l-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanone;<br>
1 -(3,5-dibenzyloxyphenyl)-2-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethanone;<br>
1 -(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanone;<br>
l-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-isopropyloxyphenyl)ethanone; and<br>
l-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)ethanone;       of use respectively in producing (E)-trimethylresveratrol, (E)-tribenzylresveratrol, (E)-tetramethylpiceatannol, (E)-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-isopropyloxy-stilbene and (E)-3,5-dimethoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxy-stilbene.<br>
The P-ketoesters of formula (III) can be obtained, preferably, by a condensation reaction       of Claisen type -ether/ester derivatives (I) and ether/ester derivatives (II), such as describe.:. :.~ -sample, in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure MMT  * \ey &amp; Sons, 4th edition, pages 491-493, as indicated^ below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the formulae (I) and (II),<br>
A represents hydrogen or else an OR2 group,<br>
R1, R2, R1 and R'2 represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched alkyl<br>
group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group including from 7 to 16       carbon atoms which is optionally substituted by one or more alkoxy or halogen groups,<br>
it also being possible for R1 and R2 to form a hydrocarbon chain of structure -(CH2)n-<br>
withn= 1 to 3, and<br>
R and R' represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched alkyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention, where R' represents a linear or branched alkyl group 5      comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, it is, for example, a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl group.<br>
This condensation reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a strong base at the reflux temperature of the reaction medium with stoichiometric amounts of       ether/ester derivatives (I) and (II).<br>
Mention may be made, as examples of strong base, of alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium ethoxide, or alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride.<br>
      Under preferred  of implementation of the process described above, 2 to 5 equivalents of  "use are employed, particularly 2 to 2.5 equivalents.<br>
The starting etner/esiers (1) and (II) can be synthesized from the corresponding hydroxyaromatic acids, hydroxyaromatic esters or etherified hydroxyaromatic acids by       known methods, such as described in J. Med. Chem., 30(11), (1987), 2121-26;<br>
Tetrahedron, 59, (03), 33-22; Chem. Lett., 11, (1999), 1193-94; /. Am. Chem. Soc, 126(32), (04), 9882-83. These starting materials are inexpensive reactants which are easy to employ for a person skilled in the art.<br>
      4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, resorcylic acid or 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid can be cited as examples of hydroxyaromatic acids.<br>
ROUTE A for the synthesis of the compounds of formula (VI)<br>
This route consists of the reduction of the ketones of formula (IV) described above in 30      order to obtain 1,2-diarylethanol derivatives of formula (V) as indicated below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A represents hydrogen or else an OR2 group, 5      R1, R2, R'1 and R'2 represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched aikyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group including from 7 to 16 carbon atoms which is optionally substituted by one or more alkoxy or halogen groups, it also being possible for R1 and R2 to form a hydrocarbon chain of structure -(CH2)n-withn= 1 to 3. <br>
The ketones of forrn.ua can be reduced by application or adaptation of the methods described, for exan-.p;.-c.    advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, John Wiiey 6c Sons, 4th edition, pages 9-918.<br>
     Under preferred conditions of the process described above, the ketones of formula (IV) are reduced to give alcohols of formula (V) by the action of a metal hydride, such as LiAlH4 or NaBBU. This reduction is generally carried out using from 0. to 3 equivalents of metal hydride. Particularly, 1 equivalent of NaBH4 can be used.<br>
      Alternatively, for the ketones of formula (IV) in which A represents hydrogen or else an OR2 group and R1, R2, R'1 and R'2 represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched alkyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, it also being possible for R1 and R2 to form a hydrocarbon chain of structure -(CH2)n- with n = 1 to 3, the reduction can be carried out by hydrogenation. Under preferred conditions, the hydrogenation is<br>
      carried out in the presence of catalysts, such as Pd/C, in a solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, under a hydrogen pressure of the order of 3 x 5 Pa (3 bar) to 50 * 5 Pa (50 bar), at a temperature of between ambient temperature and approximately 50Â°C. Particularly, the said hydrogenation reaction is carried out under a hydrogen pressure of<br>
between 5 x 5 Pa and  x 5 Pa, at ambient temperature, in the presence of 5 to % by weight of Pd/C with respect to the ketone of formula (IV).<br>
This reaction makes it possible in particular to obtain the following preferred 5      compounds of formula (V):<br>
l-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol, and<br>
1 -(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanol<br>
and more particularly a novel compound of formula (V) in which A represents hydrogen and R1, R'1 and R'2 represent a benzyl group, consisting in particular of l-(3,5-      dibenzyloxyphenyl)-2-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethanol. This novel compound is obtained by reacting the compound of formula (IV) l-(3,5-dibenzyloxyphenyl)-2-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)ethanone as indicated above.<br>
Once the alcohols of structure (V) are formed, the latter are dehydrated in the presence       of catalytic amounts of scon  and  such as, for example, sulphuric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid or  acid.<br>
Preferably, the dehydration reaction is carried out in an aromatic solvent, such as toluene, at reflux, in the presence of catalytic amounts of p-toluenesulphonic acid of 1 to        mol% with respect to the alcohol of formula (V) and more preferably of 5 to  mol%. The water formed during the reaction is generally removed by azeotropic distillation. The (E)-stilbene derivatives of structure (VI) of the invention are obtained according to this procedure.<br>
      ROUTE B for the synthesis of the compounds of formula (VI)<br>
This other route consists, in a first step, in synthesizing arylsulphonylhydrazone compounds of formula (VII) by reacting the compound of formula (IV) with an arylsulphonylhydrazide, as indicated in the following scheme:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This reaction is generally carried out in an alcoholic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, or in an aromatic solvent, such as toluene, in the presence of catalytic amounts 5      of acid, such as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid, if necessary.<br>
The arylsulphonylhydrazide compounds are known from the literature or are commercially available. Mention may be made, by way of examples, of phenylsulphonylhydrazide and p-toluenesulphonylhydrazide, sold by Aldrich. <br>
Under preferred conditions, this action is carried out at reflux in ethanol or toluene using an excess of arylsulphÂ»&gt;n/'.- --irazide of between 1.1 and 1.5 equivalents, p-Toluenesulphonylhydrazick  prefered.<br>
      The compounds of formula (VII)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
thus synthesized are characterized in that:       Ar presents a phenyl or o-, m- or p-tolyl group, A represents hydrogen or else an OR? group,<br>
R1, R2, R'1 and R'2 represent, independently of one another, a linear or branched alkyl group comprising from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group including from 7 to 16 carbon atoms which is optionally substituted by one or more alkoxy or halogen groups,<br>
it also being possible for R] and R2 to form a hydrocarbon chain of structure -(CH2)n-withn = 1 to 3.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides novel compounds of formula (VII), 5      characterized in that:<br>
Ar represents a p-tolyl group, and<br>
either A represents hydrogen and all three of the R1, R1i and R'2 groups represent methyl groups or benzyl groups,<br>
or A represents an -OCH3 group and the R1, R1 and R'2 groups each represent a methyl       group,<br>
or A represents hydrogen, R'1 andR'2 represent a methyl group and R1 represents an isopropyl group,<br>

in Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 4th edition, pages 19-21.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent in the presence of a base and in the 5      presence of catalytic amounts of phase transfer catalyst or of surfactant, if these are necessary.<br>
Under preferred conditions of implementation of the process described above, use is made of an excess of strong base of between 2 to 3 equivalents, such as lithium       derivatives, for example methyllithium ethyllithium, butyllithium or lithium<br>
diisopropylamide, in nonhydroxylated solvents, such as diethyl ether, isopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, THF or dioxane, at a temperature of between 0Â°C and 5Â°C.<br>
Under other preferred conditions, use is made of at least one equivalent of strong base,       more preferably of an excess of strong  of between 2 to 5 equivalents, such as alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium mesho   ir potassium tert-butoxide or sodium amide, or alkali metal hydrides, such as sodr-tr â¢ -indo or potassium hydride, or alkaline bases, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, or sodium or potassium carbonate, at the reflux temperature of the reaction medium, in hydroxylated or nonhydroxylated       solvents, preferably nonhydroxylated solvents, having a boiling point of at least 90Â°C, preferably of at least 0Â°C, such as aromatic solvents, for example toluene, xylenes, mesitylene, ethylbenzene or chlorobenzene, dioxane or ethylene glycol, or in glycol ethers with a boiling point of at least 0Â°C.<br>
      Use may be made, to promote the dissolution of the bases in the reaction medium, of phase transfer catalysts, such as quaternary ammonium salts, for example triethylbenzylammonium chloride, or polyglycol ethers, for example Triton XI00Â®.<br>
Under yet other preferred conditions, the reaction is carried out in a nonhydroxylated 30      solvent having a boiling point of at least 3 00Â°C at the reflux temperature of the reaction medium, in the presence of 2.1 to 2.2 equivalents of potassium tert-butoxide and in the presence of 1 to  mol% of Triton XI00   with respect to the arylsulphonylhydrazone of formula (VII).<br>

This novel compound consists of the following:       -        (E)-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-isopropyloxy-stilbene.<br>
A particularly preferred aspect of the invention consists of the synthesis of (E)-<br>
trimethylresveratrol, (E)-tribenzylresveratrol and (E)-tetramethylpiceatannol from the<br>
compounds of formula (VII) as described above. <br>

The (E)-stilbene derivatives of formula (\'i) can be deprotected by processes known in<br>
the literature. This deprotection can be carried out by application or adaptation of the       methods described, for example, in WO 03/086414, WO 01/060774, EP 1 466 884<br>
or Tetrahedron, 59 (18), (03), 33-3321.<br>
Under preferred processing conditions, use is made of 3 to  molar equivalents of boron tribromide at a temperature of between -30Â°C and ambient temperature.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br><br>
According to this method, it is possible, according to the process of the invention, to obtain resveratrol and piceatannol from the compounds of formula (IV) and more particularly from the compounds of formula (VII), defined above. 5<br>
The present invention is also targeted at a process for the synthesis of a compound of formula (VII) as described above employing at least one compound chosen from those of formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV), defined in the present patent application.<br>
