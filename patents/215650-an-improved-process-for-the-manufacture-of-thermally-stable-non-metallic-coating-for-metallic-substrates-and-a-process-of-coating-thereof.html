				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the manufacture of<br>
thermally stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates and a process of<br>
coating thereof. The present invention particularly relates to an improved process<br>
for the manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating, for metallic<br>
substrates such as super alloy components, starting from from a novel<br>
synergistic composition as described and claimed in our co-pending patent<br>
application no. NF-31 / 03 and a process of coating metallic substrates with the<br>
novel thermally stable non-metallic coating. The present invention more<br>
particularly relates to an improved process for the manufacture of thermally<br>
stable non-metallic coating comprising a glass-ceramic selected from the barium<br>
magnesium silicate system by a novel processing technique.<br>
The thermally stable non-metallic coating of the present invention over the<br>
surface of the metal or alloy substrate serves as an oxidation resistant coating to<br>
prevent oxygen attack of the metal at elevated temperatures and also as a<br>
thermal barrier to the metal surface to prevent rapid heat up of the metal surface.<br>
There is a well recognized need, in hot zone components of turbine engines and<br>
heat exchangers, for example, for materials capable of withstanding continuous<br>
operating temperatures in excess of 1000째C. While a variety of high temperature<br>
materials are known, it is common practice to use high temperature stable alloys<br>
known as super alloys in the more severe applications. Characteristically, these<br>
alloys are rich in nickel, cobalt, chromium, or iron, with nickel or cobalt being the<br>
principal metal bases. These super alloys have been distinguished from other<br>
high temperature resistant materials on the basis of being sufficiently resistant to<br>
oxidation to permit operation in an oxidizing atmosphere without a protective<br>
coating. Nevertheless, under extreme hostile conditions, such as encountered by<br>
hot zone components in gas turbine engines, even the super alloys tend to<br>
deteriorate unless protected by a oxygen barrier coating.<br>
A very well known method of protecting metal components from oxidation at<br>
elevated temperatures in a hostile environment is to apply a continuous<br>
monolithic glass coating on the exposed surface. This coating completely<br>
encapsulates and isolates the metallic surface from the surrounding oxygen<br>
containing atmosphere. However, viscous flow of the glass coating may occur<br>
when large surface stresses develop during high temperature use, resulting in<br>
thin spots and catastrophic coating failure.<br>
Another method of achieving higher viscosity is by mixing crystalline materials as<br>
second phase with the glass frits prior to application of the coating. However,<br>
these glass-crystalline mixtures sinter rather non-uniformly, the crystal size and<br>
homogeneity of the resultant microstructure being very difficult to control. Certain<br>
portions of the substrate, therefore, tend to be entirely free from crystals,<br>
whereas other portions have too many (or too large) crystals to sinter well. A void<br>
free coating with this heterogeneous glass-crystal mixture is thus difficult to<br>
obtain.<br>
References may be made to the following U. S. Patents:<br>
No. 3,397,076 (Little et al.) describes fused crystallizable ground and cover coats<br>
for high temperature alloys in which the major elements are cobalt, nickel,<br>
chromium, iron or mixtures. The ground coat is lithium free and contains 35-65%<br>
Si02 and12-45% BaO. Examples also contain substantial amounts of R20, B2C3<br>
and /or TiO2. The drawbacks are use of two separate coating systems, one<br>
ground coat and other cover coat. The coating composition contains substantial<br>
amount of alkali oxides which is normally unsuitable for continuous use at high<br>
operating temperature.<br>
No. 3,467,534 (MacDowell) discloses glass-ceramic articles consisting<br>
essentially of 20-70% BaO and 30-80% SiO2 and having a barium silicate<br>
principal crystal phase. A preferred example is described as considered for<br>
coating metals. This article is related to glass-ceramic objects not applicable to<br>
coatings.<br>
No. 3,531,303 (Bahat) discloses glass-ceramic articles in the alkaline earth<br>
aluminosilicate field wherein hexagonal alkaline earth feldspar or a triclinic form<br>
is the principal crystal phase. The materials are highly refractory with service<br>
temperatures up to 1700째C and consist essentially of 12-53% SiO2, 17-55% RO<br>
where RO is 17-50% SrO and 25-50% BaO, 10-58% AI2O3 and a nucleating<br>
agent. The drawback of the process is same as above, that is it relates to glassceramic<br>
objects and is not applicable to coatings.<br>
No. 3,578,470 (Bahat) discloses glass-ceramic materials in the BaO-AI2O3-Si02<br>
composition field nucleated with Ta205 and/or Nb205 that are especially suited to<br>
sealing with tungsten or molybdenum and their alloys. This method describes a<br>
sealing material and is not applicable to coatings.<br>
No. 3,837,978 (Busdiecker) discloses barium aluminosilicate glass-ceramics<br>
nucleated by tin oxide, having a hexacelsian primary crystal phase, and having a<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion in the range of 50-170X10"7/째C.<br>
Nos. 4,256,796; 4,358,541 and 4,385,127 disclose mixed barium magnesium<br>
and calcium magnesium silicate coatings, fluxed with B2Os. The drawback in the<br>
high temperature resistance of these coatings is the use of B2O3. A high B2O3<br>
residual glass (or even a borate crystal) tends to allow the microstructure to<br>
move and flow at temperatures much below the solidus of the primary refractory<br>
silicate phases.<br>
Gas turbine engines and heat exchangers operate in a hostile environment at<br>
operating temperatures in excess of 1000째C. There is a considerable demand for<br>
materials capable of withstanding those severe working conditions. While a<br>
variety of high temperature materials are known, it is a common practice to use<br>
certain" nickel or cobalt based super alloys in the more severe applications.<br>
These super alloys have been distinguished from other high temperature<br>
materials on the basis of being considerably resistant to oxidation to permit<br>
continuous operation in an oxidizing atmosphere without a protective coating.<br>
Nevertheless, under more severe conditions, such as encountered by hot zone<br>
components in gas turbine engines in an advanced aircraft, even the super alloys<br>
tend to deteriorate very fast unless protected by a suitable coating.<br>
A well known technique of protecting the super alloys from oxidation at elevated<br>
temperatures is to apply an impervious stable continuous monolithic glassy<br>
coating. This completely encapsulates and isolates the material from the<br>
.surrounding hostile environment. However, viscous flow of the glassy coating<br>
material may occur when large surface stresses develop during high temperature<br>
use. In some cases generation of hot spots occurs which led to premature<br>
catastrophic failure of the coating as well as the component.<br>
The viscosity being a structural property of the system, can be easily tailored by<br>
mixing certain refractory materials with the glassy coating materials (frits) during<br>
processing (milling), before application of the coating on metal surface..<br>
However, these glass- crystalline mixtures are very difficult to fuse at the required<br>
firing temperature and sinter rather non-uniformly. The microstructure and<br>
homogeneity of the coating is very difficult to control. Certain portion of the<br>
resultant coating generates hot spots which may cause premature failure. A void<br>
free coating with this heterogeneous coating system is thus very difficult to<br>
obtain.<br>
From the above referred hitherto known prior art disclosures it is clear that there<br>
is a definite need for providing an improved process for the manufacture of<br>
thermally stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates such as nickel or<br>
cobalt base super alloy and stainless steel components that are required to<br>
operate at temperatures above 1000째C.<br>

and a process of coating thereof, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed<br>
above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the<br>
manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates such<br>

resistance properties by following a novel composition and novel processing<br>
techniques.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
the manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates<br>
starting from a novel synergistic composition as described and claimed in our copending<br>
patent application no. NF-31 / 03.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process<br>
for obtaining a coating material by using a combination of alkaline earth metal<br>
oxides such as BaO, CaO and MgO instead of BaO alone.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
obtaining a coating material by using a bonding oxide (MoOa) to promote<br>
adherence of the coating to the base metal substrate.<br>

constituent of the coating.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
obtaining a coating material which can be melted in a ceramic crucible at a<br>
temperature in the range of 1400 to 1450 degree C in an ambient atmosphere.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process of<br>
coating metallic substrates such as super alloy components which obviates the<br>
drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process of<br>
coating metallic substrates such as super alloy components that is more<br>
effective, easier to apply, than previously known coatings of the prior art.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process<br>
for the manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating for obtaining a<br>
reliable and reproducible high temperature protective coating for nickel or cobalt<br>
base super alloy and stainless steel substrates that are required to operate at<br>
temperatures above 1000째C.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
obtaining a high temperature protective coating that adheres strongly and resists<br>
spelling during thermal cycling.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
obtaining a high temperature protective coating technique that exhibits the<br>
excellent flow characteristics of a glass coating as it is fired in one temperature<br>
range, and becomes resistant to flow due to subsequent crystallization as it is<br>
heated in the required operating temperature range.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for<br>
obtaining a coating that provides a useful degree of thermal insulation to the<br>
base metal surface.<br>
In the present invention there is provided an improved process for the<br>
manufacture of thermally stable, high temperature resistant, non-metallic, glass<br>
ceramic coating material suitable for metallic substrates and a process of<br>
application of the coating on such substrates as nickel and cobalt based super<br>
alloys and stainless steel. In this improved process the partially crystallized<br>
coating composition comprises of a mixture, based on its oxide content, of<br>
barium oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, silicon di-oxide, boron tri-oxide<br>
and molybdenum oxide. The coating materials are further processed with a<br>
mixture of washed chromium oxide, precipitated silica, cobalt oxide and china<br>
clay in water and applied to pre-cleaned metal surface and fired to provide a<br>
glass-ceramic coating on the metal. The coating is defect free, thermal shock<br>
resistant, highly adherent and suitable for continuous use at temperatures in the<br>
range of 1000째C to 1050째C in oxidizing environment.<br>
The method for preparing and applying the novel inventive coatings of the<br>
present invention involves five fundamental steps:<br>
First, a glass-forming batch of a predetermined formulation is melted;<br>
Second, the melt is cooled to a glass and the glass comminuted to a fine powder<br>
or frit;<br>
Third, a liquid slurry is prepared of the frit;<br>
Fourth, the slurry is applied as a coating onto a surface of a desired substrate;<br>
and<br>
Fifth, the coated substrate is fired to temperatures of at least 1200째C to fuse the<br>
frit particles together into an integral, essentially non-porous, vitreous coating and<br>
subsequently heat treated to cause crystallization in situ to take place therein.<br>
In general, to insure adequate flow of the glass during sintering, thereby<br>
providing an essentially "pinhole-free" coating, and to develop a high volume of<br>
crystallinity, the frit will desirably be powdered to particles passing a 325 United<br>
States Standard Sieve (44 microns). Aqueous slurry can be employed for<br>
coating.<br>
The initial step in the preparation of the porcelains of this invention is to prepare<br>
a glass frit having the desired composition. The raw materials which are used in<br>
the preparation of the glass frit can be of commercial glass-making quality. The<br>
raw materials should be free of any impurities which will adversely affect the<br>
quality of the final porcelain. Particular attention should be directed to the<br>
amount, if any, of alkaline impurities in the raw materials. The raw materials can<br>
be the specific oxide required or a material which upon heating to the melting<br>
temperature employed in the glass making process, which is of the order of 1400<br>
to 1500 degree C, will be converted to the desired oxide. Examples of the latter<br>
material include magnesium carbonate (extra light grade) and barium carbonate<br>
(extra light grade). The raw materials are weighed out based on the oxide<br>
content and the components are blended together. In order to facilitate further<br>
processing steps the mixture of materials should also be heat treated to remove<br>
any moisture.<br>
The mixture is then melted using conventional glass melting techniques. The raw<br>
materials are gradually heated to about 1400 to 1450 degree C. and then the<br>
resultant molten mass are maintained at this temperature with occasional stirring<br>
until a homogeneous melt is obtained. Typically, it has been found that a melt<br>
time of about one hour is sufficient depending upon the equipment and amount of<br>
material employed.<br>
The next step in the process is to convert the molten glass mass into a glass frit.<br>
Various well known methods can be employed for this process. It has been found<br>
that for the purposes of this invention it is preferable to pour the molten stream of<br>
glass over a water chilled stainless steel tray to result in broken pieces of<br>
solidified glass. The solidified glass frit is then crushed and the resulting particles<br>
are placed in a ball mill and dry milled with a grinding media until the particles are<br>
substantially uniform in size.<br>
Then the dried milled glass particles are subjected to a second grinding. This<br>
time along with certain mill additives which include precipitated silica, washed<br>
chromium oxide and cobalt oxide, water is added to the ball mill in an amount<br>
sufficient to form slurry with the glass particles. The slurry is tumbled in the ball<br>
mill with a grinding media for about 10 to 48 hours until the particle size of the<br>
glass is reduced to between 3 and 5 microns. The slurry is removed from the ball<br>
mill and additional water is added to dilute the slurry from between 40 and 60<br>
weight percent of glass frit. This suspension is the stock solution (slip) used in<br>
subsequent coating steps.<br>
The glass frit of this invention can advantageously be used to form glass-ceramic<br>
coatings on various types of metal structures. The glass-ceramic coating of this<br>
invention is especially useful as coatings for high temperature protection of super<br>
alloy components which require a high degree of performance and reliability<br>
under adverse conditions.<br>
In practicing the invention, the surface of a super alloy component to be coated,<br>
must be clean, free from any impurity and oxide, may be coated with the slip in<br>
any conventional manner. The method we prefer is conventional vitreous<br>
enameling technique.<br>
In working with the barium silicate system coatings, it was observed that good<br>
adherence was obtained when the coating was fired in ambient atmosphere at a<br>
temperature of 1200째C.<br>
The glass powder coated metal body is then heated to a temperature of 1000째C<br>
to 1200째C. This softens the glass particles to a lower viscosity which spreads<br>
uniformly over the entire metal surface, reacts with it and produces a dense,<br>
smooth, impervious, well-formed continuous glass coating that is essentially<br>
amorphous. The glass-coated component is then heated to a somewhat lower<br>
temperature in the range of 820 to 840째C. This effects development of a glassceramic<br>
which forms a dense, adherent, strong, refractory, crystalline coating. A<br>
key feature of this process is the ability to control the heat treatment schedule,<br>
and thus the reproducibility of the coating process.<br>
In our co-pending patent application no. NF-31 / 03, we have described and<br>
claimed a synergistic composition for making thermally stable non-metallic<br>
coating on metals like cobalt or nickel base super alloys, which comprises 32.2 to<br>
38.0 % (w/w) SiO2; 43.8 to 48.8 % (w/w) BaCO3l BaNO3 or mixture thereof;<br>
0 to 6.8 % (w/w) CaCO3; 0 to 8.8 % (w/w) MgCO3; 0 to 4.7 % (w/w) ZnO; 0 to 5.1<br>
% (w/w) bonding agent such as (NH4)3MoO4, MoO3and 0 to 10.1 % (w/w) H3B03.<br>
The SiOa used may be taken as quartz powder, quartz sand powder (-100<br>
mesh).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the<br>
manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates which<br>
comprises: weighing, mixing and sieving ingredients in the range of 32.2 to 38.0<br>
% (w/w) Si02; 43.8 to 48.8 % (w/w) BaCO3, BaNO3 or mixture thereof; 0 to<br>
6.8 % (w/w) CaCO3; 0 to 8.8 % (w/w) MgC03; 0 to 4.7 % (w/w) ZnO; 0 to 5.1 %<br>
(w/w) bonding agent such as (NH4)3Mo04, Mo03and 0 to 10.1 % (w/w) H3B03|to<br>
obtain a glass forming batch, melting under stirring the said glass forming batch<br>
at a temperature in the range of 1400째C to 1450째C for a period in the range of 2<br>
to 3 hours to obtain molten glass, quenching the molten glass and comminuting<br>
to obtain glass frit powder, mixing the glass frit with mill additions essentially<br>
consisting of washed chromium oxide in the range of 5.0 to 45.0% w/w,<br>
precipitated silica in the range of 0 to 5.0% w/w, china clay in the range of 0 to<br>
10.0% w/w and cobalt oxide in the range of 0 to 1.0% w/w in an aqueous<br>
medium to obtain a non-metallic coating slurry.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention quenched molten glass is<br>
comminuted by known methods to obtain glass frit powder of the order of 44<br>
microns.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the mixing of the glass frit with<br>
mill additions in an aqueous medium to obtain a slurry is carried out in a ball mill<br>
with grinding media for about 10 to 48 hours to obtain particle size in the range of<br>
3 to 5 microns.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process of<br>
coating metallic substrates with the non-metallic coating slurry herein above<br>
obtained, which comprises: diluting the coating slurry by adding water in the<br>
range of 40 to 60 weight percent of glass frit, applying the liquid coating slurry<br>
onto a pre-cleaned surface of a desired metal substrate to obtain a coated<br>
substrate, firing the said coated substrate at a temperature in the range of<br>
1000째C to 1200째C over a period in the range of 5 to 30 minutes to obtain a<br>
coated fired body, heat treating the coated fired body at a temperature in the<br>
range of 820째C to 840째C for a period in the range of 1.0 to 8.0 hours.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the present invention the pre-cleaning of the metal<br>
substrate is done by known metal cleaning process to remove impurities such as<br>
oxides, oil or grease, dirt, and other contaminants.<br>
In a yet further embodiment of the present invention the application of the liquid<br>
coating slurry onto a pre-cleaned surface of a desired metal substrate is carried<br>
out by any conventional method, preferably conventional vitreous enameling<br>
technique.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the metal substrate is such as<br>
stainless steel, nickel base super alloys, cobalt base super alloys, Inconel, and<br>
Nimonic alloys.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in providing an improved process for<br>
the manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates,<br>
wherein the coating is defect free, thermal shock resistant, highly adherent and<br>
suitable for continuous use at temperatures in the range of 1000째C to 1050째C in<br>
oxidizing environment. The present invention provides a coating for metallic<br>
substrates which is a very effective oxygen barrier over the surface of a nickel or<br>
cobalt base super alloy or stainless steel substrate. The barrier is in the form of a<br>
coating comprising a barium magnesium silicate based glass-ceramic material.<br>
The present coating is continuous, impervious, and free from all types of<br>
enameling defects such as holes, fish scales, hairlines, blisters, cracks or thin<br>
spots and resists spelling or chipping during thermal cycling.<br>
The novelty has been achieved in the present invention by the non-obvious<br>
inventive steps of providing high temperature viscosity to the glass-ceramic<br>
coating by mixing refractory material, a novel blend of alkaline earth metal oxides<br>
such as herein described, in the amorphous form which increases high<br>
temperature viscosity of the resultant glass-ceramic coating. In this improved<br>
process the partially crystallized coating composition comprises of a mixture,<br>
based on its oxide content, of barium oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide,<br>
silicon di-oxide, boron tri-oxide and molybdenum oxide. In another inventive step<br>
the coating materials are further processed with mill additions which are<br>
essentially a mixture of washed chromium oxide, precipitated silica, cobalt oxide<br>
and china clay in water and applied to pre-cleaned metal surface. Yet another<br>
inventive step resides in the key feature of this process which is the ability to<br>
control the heat treatment schedule, and thus the reproducibility of the coating<br>
process. In this inventive step the glass powder coated metal body is fired at a<br>
temperature of 1000째C to 1200째C to provide a glass-ceramic coating on the<br>
metal. This softens the glass particles to a lower viscosity which spreads<br>
uniformly over the entire metal surface, reacts with it and produces a dense,<br>
smooth, impervious, well-formed continuous glass coating that is essentially<br>
amorphous. The glass-coated component is then heated to a somewhat lower<br>
temperature in the range of 820 to 840째C. This effects development of a glassceramic<br>
which forms a dense, adherent, strong, refractory, crystalline coating.<br>
The resultant coating fuses smoothly in the required firing temperature and<br>
produces a uniform microstructure and eliminates possibility of generating hot<br>
spots during application. In particular, these amorphous additives permit the<br>
glass to soften and flow smoothly over the metal surface into a continuous,<br>
glassy coating before viscosity of the system increases considerably due to<br>
refractory material addition. This inventive finding is a key point to producing a<br>
high temperature protective coating on super alloy substrates.<br>
Thus in the present invention the novel blend of alkaline earth metal oxides<br>
produces more thermally stable glassy coating on the super alloy surface and at<br>
the same time provides a novel glass ceramic coating having different set of<br>
crystalline phases in the resultant coating microstructure. The present glassceramic<br>
contains barium magnesium silicate as the principal phase along with<br>
barium silicate as a minor phase. The resultant coating is defect free, thermal<br>
shock resistant, highly adherent and suitable for continuous use at temperatures<br>
in the range of 1000째C to 1050째C in oxidizing environment.<br>
Stepwise details of the improved process of the present invention for the<br>
manufacture of thermally stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates are<br>
given as below:<br>
1. A glass forming batch of pre-determined composition which comprises of 32.2<br>
to 38.0 % (w/w) SiO2, 43.8 to 48.8 % (w/w) BaCO3, 0 to 6.8 % (w/w) CaCO3, 0 to<br>
8.8 % (w/w) MgCO3, 0 to 4.7 % (w/w) ZnO, 0 to 5.1 % (w/w) (NH4)3Mo04 and 0 to<br>
10.1 % (w/w) H3BO3is weighed, mixed and sieved.<br>
2. The above said glass-forming batch is melted under stirring at a temperature<br>
in the range of 1400째C to 1450째C for a period in the range of 2 to 3 hours to<br>
obtain molten glass.<br>
3. The melt is cooled rapidly in air and the solid formed is comminuted to a fine<br>
powder or frit;<br>
4. A liquid slurry is prepared by milling the frit with mill additions which comprises<br>
washed chromium oxide in the range of 5.0 to 45.0% w/w, precipitated silica in<br>
the range of 0 to 5.0% w/w, china clay in the range of 0 to 10.0% w/w and cobalt<br>
oxide in the range of 0 to 1.0% w/w. in water. The slurry is tumbled in the ball mill<br>
with a grinding media for about 10 to 48 hours until the particle size of the glass<br>
is reduced to between 3 and 5 microns.<br>
5. Diluting the coating slurry by adding water in the range of 40 to 60 weight<br>
percent of glass frit. The slurry is applied as a coating onto a surface of a precleaned<br>
metal substrate.<br>
6. The coated substrate is fired for 5 to 30 minutes at temperatures in the range<br>
of 1000째C to 1200째C to fuse the frit particles together into an integral, essentially<br>
non-porous, vitreous coating and subsequently heat treated in the temperature<br>
range of 820째C to 840째C for a period in the range of 1.0 to 8.0 hours to cause<br>
crystallization in situ to take place therein.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the actual practice of<br>
the improved process of the present invention for the manufacture of thermally<br>
stable non-metallic coating for metallic substrates. Therefore, these illustrative<br>
examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
