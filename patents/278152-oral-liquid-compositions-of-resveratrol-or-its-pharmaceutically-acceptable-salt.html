				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to low-calorie liquid antioxidant compositions of stilbenoid, in particular resveratrol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, enantiomers or derivatives thereof, the processes for preparing the same and methods of use and treatment of such compositions.<br>
<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
<br>
Resveratrol (Formula I) is a polyphenolic stilbenoid, chemically known as 5-[(1E)-2-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]-1,3,benzenediol. Stilbenoids such as resveratrol are considered to possess antitumor, antioxidant as well as a number of other positive health effects. Resveratrol has been shown to promote bone health, elicit a vasoprotective effect, counteract high fat diet and aid in weight loss. The activation of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) enzyme by resveratrol has been thought to be the key factor leading to the reported increase in life expectancy by resveratrol.<br>
 <br>
(Formula I)<br>
<br>
Liquid formulations of resveratrol are commercially available. Vivix® Cellular Anti- aging tonic is a commercially available liquid dosage form of resveratrol. The tonic contains resveratrol in combination with a number of antioxidants. Resveratrol Life Tonic™, another liquid dosage form of resveratrol, from Life Time vitamins is available. Being tonics, these formulations deliver resveratrol in a highly concentrated form for elucidation of optimal effect.<br>
<br>
Liquid nutritional supplements such as tonics, owing to the high concentration of active present in the composition, suffer from potential patient non-compliance. These liquids are difficult to measure out precisely for the correct dose and also attract possibility of spillage which causes loss of active ingredients resulting in a deficient administered dose. Moreover, since the liquid supplements are usually loaded with ingredients (to deliver enough nutrients in one or two tablespoon dose), the taste of the such supplements usually, is unacceptable and is another major factor contributing to the unacceptability of such fortified liquid dosage forms by consumers.<br>
 <br>
Functional liquids containing nutritional supplements are becoming mainstream due to ease of consumption and patient compliance. The functional beverages help individuals consume nutritional supplements in an easy and regular fashion. Moreover, being clear products just like water, consumers link them more closely with water's heritage, instead of a linkage to medicine and hence such products are more appealing to health conscious consumers.<br>
<br>
Resveratrol based dilute liquid drinks have been reported. EP1762234A1 exemplifies resveratrol formulations comprising fruit juice. The exemplified formulations are both non-carbonated as well as carbonated formulations. PCT publication WO 2009/003798A1 discloses a liquid composition of trans-resveratrol based on fruit juice comprising a liquid protein base. US 2008/0213433A1 reports a non-alcoholic and non-fermented beverage of resveratrol. The beverage comprises resveratrol solution buffered with a buffering agent such as sodium phosphate. The prior art dilute liquid formulations of resveratrol are either buffered solutions of resveratrol or have the drawback of being high on calorie content, due to the presence of fruit juice and artificial sugar in the formulations, which makes them unacceptable to health conscious consumers.<br>
<br>
None of the documents disclose buffer-free and low-calorie aqueous formulations of resveratrol, which are based majorly on natural ingredients. Thus, there are no known available liquid dosage forms of resveratrol as disclosed in the context of the present invention. Hence, the present invention fills a highly desirable gap in the technological field comprising economical and low-calorie functional beverages of resveratrol which do not comprise a buffer system.<br>
<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide stable, aqueous compositions of resveratrol, wherein the resveratrol formulations do not contain a buffer system.<br>
<br>
Further it is an objective of the present invention to provide antioxidant compositions of resveratrol, which are formulated majorly with natural ingredients and are extremely low on calorie content.<br>
<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to stable compositions which comprise a liquid antioxidant composition of a stilbenoid, particularly resveratrol. The resveratrol compositions as per the present invention are fonnulated with a calorie content of less than 1 calorie and do not contain a buffer system.<br>
<br>
As used herein, the term "resveratrol" refers collectively to trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol, mixtures thereof or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, enantiomers or derivatives. In an embodiment, resveratrol salts such as resveratrol phosphate, resveratrol glycinate, resveratrol serinate, resveratrol alaninate etc were used as the source of the active ingredient resveratrol in the context of the present invention.<br>
<br>
The preferred concentration of resveratrol in the preparation according to the invention is from about 5 mg to about 300 mg per 100 ml of the formulation, in particular from about 50 mg to about 150 mg per 100 ml of the formulation, especially from about 75 mg to about 125 mg per 100 ml of the formulation.<br>
<br>
In an embodiment, stable antioxidant compositions as disclosed in the present invention are formulated as liquid formulations, in particular liquid oral formulations in a solvent. In another embodiment of the present invention, the preferable solvent is water.<br>
<br>

Addition of synergists, such as citric acid, citraconic acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid and the like to potentiate the antioxidant effect is covered within the scope of the invention without limitation. In an embodiment, ascorbic acid was found to be useful as an antioxidant in the context of the present invention. An antioxidant such as ascorbic acid may be present in an amount of from about 0.01% to about 0.1% w/v, preferably in an amount of from about 0.03% to about 0.08% w/v.<br>
<br>
Flavors can be added in the formulation. Flavoring agents that may be used include, but are not limited to natural flavors, natural fruit flavors, artificial flavors, artificial fruit flavors, flavor enhancers or mixtures thereof. Natural flavors, artificial flavors or mixtures thereof include, but are not limited to mint (such as peppermint or spearmint), menthol, cinnamon, vanilla, artificial vanilla, chocolate, artificial chocolate, bubblegum and the like. Natural fruit flavors, artificial fruit flavors or mixtures thereof include, but are not limited to cherry, grape, orange, strawberry, lemon and the like.
