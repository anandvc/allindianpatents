TECHNICAL FIELD <br>
The present invention relates to information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatuses and, more particularly,to an information recording and reproducing apparatus which performs recording and<br>
reproduction of information on a recordable or<br>
rewritable recording medium hiving a plurality of<br>
recording layers.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There is an information recording and.<br>
reproducing apparatus that performs a so-called<br>
background formatting, when, for example, formatting a<br>
DVD+RW disc which is a rewritable disc. In the<br>
background formatting, a notification of completion of<br>
formatting is sent to a host computer at a time when<br>
recording is performed on only a part of a lead-in area<br>
of the DVD+RW disc, and a remaining area is recorded by<br>
dummy data when there is no access request from the host<br><br>
computer. According to the background formatting, a<br>
formatting process time is greatly reduced.<br>
Additionally, as another feature of the<br>
background formatting, there is an advantage that a disk<br>
can be ejected in the middle of a formatting process.<br>
At that time, in order to enable reproduction by a<br>
conventional reproduction only apparatus, when ejecting<br>
a disc in a middle of a formatting process, the disc is<br>
ejected after filling an unrecorded area of a data area<br>
with dummy data and recording a lead-in area and a lead-<br>
out area. Thus, logical compatibility of the disc,<br>
which is ejected in the middle of the formatting process,<br>
with a DVD-ROM can be maintained.<br>
In recent years, a dual-layer DVD+RW disc<br>
(DVD+RW DL (Dual Layer) Disc), which has two recording<br>
layers, has been developed as a disc on which a large<br>
amount of data can be recorded. Accordingly, there has<br>
been developed an information recording and reproducing<br>
apparatus, which performs recording and reproduction<br>
with respect to the dual-layer DVD+RW disc (for example,<br>
refer to Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-<br>
303421).<br>
The background formatting is also used for the<br>
dual-layer DVD+RW disc, similar to the DVD+RW disc<br>
having a single recording layer. That is, a part of a<br><br>
lead-in area is recorded for a request for formatting<br>
from a host computer, and a notification of completion<br>
of the formatting is sent to the host computer so as to<br>
enable an access by the host computer and user data is<br>
recorded from a data area of the first layer. Then,<br>
while there is no access request from the host computer,<br>
remaining areas from the first layer to the second layer<br>
are recorded with dummy data. Additionally, eject of<br>
the disc in the middle of formatting process is enabled.<br>
However, when ejecting the dual-layer DVD+RW<br>
disc in the middle of a formatting process, data is<br>
recorded in a temporary middle zone (TMZ) immediately<br>
after recording end position of user data of the first<br>
layer and the data of the temporary middle zone is<br>
recorded immediately after a position corresponding to<br>
the user data recording end position in a data area of<br>
the second layer, and the disc is ejected after filling<br>
an unrecorded part of the data area of the second layer<br>
with dummy data so as to maintain compatibility with a<br>
DVD-ROM.<br>
FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are illustrations for<br>
explaining a process performed when ejecting a dual-<br>
layer DVD+RW disc in the middle of a conventional<br>
formatting process.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, after recording an initial<br><br>
zone 50 of a lead-in area, recording instructed by a<br>
host computer is permitted. Then, if a request of<br>
ejecting the optical disc is made when the user data 51<br>
is recorded, data 52 of a temporary middle zone if<br>
recorded from the end of the recorded position of the<br>
user data 51 as shown in FIG. 2, and data 53 of the<br>
temporary middle zone is recorded immediately after a<br>
position corresponding to the above-mentioned user data<br>
recording end position in the second layer. Then, an<br>
unrecorded area 54 in the second layer is recorded with<br>
dummy data, and, thereafter, the lead-in area 55 and the<br>
lead-out area 5 6 are recorded and, then, the optical<br>
disc is ejected.<br>
However, in the conventional information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatus, if a last recording<br>
position of user data or a format end position of a<br>
recording medium having a two recording layers, an area<br>
in the second layer corresponding to the first recording<br>
layer must be recorded with dummy data when a request of<br>
ejecting the recording medium is made. Thus, there is a<br>
problem that it takes a considerably long time until the<br>
recording medium is ejected.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a general object of the present<br><br>
invention to provide improved and useful information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatus and method in which<br>
the above-mentioned problems are eliminate.<br>
A more specific object of the present<br>
invention is to provide information recording apparatus<br>
and method which can reduce a time to eject a recording<br>
medium having a plurality of recording layers in the<br>
middle of a formatting process.<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned<br>
objects, there is provided according to one aspect of<br>
the present invention a method for recording<br>
information to a recording medium having at least a<br>
first recording layer and a second recording layer, the<br>
first recording layer having a data area comprising an<br>
inner side located at a radially inner region of the<br>
recording medium and an outer side located at a radially<br>
outer region of the recording medium and the second<br>
recording layer comprising a data area including an<br>
inner side located at the radially inner region of the<br>
recording medium and an outer side located at the<br>
radially outer region of the recording medium, the<br>
method comprising: performing a first formatting process<br>
on the data area of the second recording layer, said<br>
first formatting process comprising formatting said data<br>
area of the second recording layer in a series of<br><br>
recording increments, the series of recording increments<br>
progressing from the inner side of the data area of the<br>
second recording layer to the outer side of the data<br>
area of the second recording layer, wherein within each<br>
recording increment the formatting is performed along a<br>
path extending from the outer side of the data area of<br>
the second recording layer to the inner side of the data<br>
area of the second recording layer; performing a second<br>
formatting process on the data area of the first<br>
recording layer once the first formatting process has<br>
been completed, the second formatting process being<br>
performed along a path extending from the inner side of<br>
the data area of the first recording layer to the outer<br>
side of the data area of the first recording layer.<br>
The recording medium can be a disc-shaped<br>
optical recording medium, in which case the radially<br>
inner region of the recording medium would be located in<br>
the region of the inner periphery of the recording<br>
medium, and the radially outer region of the recording<br>
medium would be located in the region of the outer<br>
periphery of the recording medium. This would also<br>
apply to other shapes of recording media.<br>
The first formatting process could occur when<br>
there is no request for user data to be read or<br>
recording, and when there is no request for the disk to<br><br>
be ejected.<br>
In the above aspect, the formatting within<br>
each recording increment the formatting is performed<br>
along a path extending from the outer side of the data<br>
area of the second recording layer to the inner side of<br>
the data area of the second recording layer. In other<br>
words, the direction of formatting within each recording<br>
increment could be from the outer side of to the inner,<br>
side of the data area of the second recording layer.<br>
As a result of the features of the above<br>
aspect of the invention, the time needed to eject the<br>
recording medium having a plurality of recording layers<br>
can be reduced when ejecting the recording medium in the<br>
middle of a formatting process.<br>
The recording medium may adapted to be<br>
recorded by a laser, and the first recording layer may<br>
be the recording layer closest the laser during use. The<br>
second layer could be the layer the next closest to the<br>
laser in use.<br>
The recording medium may be associated with an<br>
order of recording user data for each recording layer,<br>
and the first recording layer may be arranged to be<br>
earlier in the recording order than the second recording<br>
layer.<br>
In some embodiments, the method further<br><br>
comprises recording user data on a- data area of the<br>
first, recording layer along a path extending from the<br>
inner side of the data area of the first recording layer<br>
to the outer side of the data area of the first<br>
recording layer on receipt of a request to record user<br>
data.<br>
On receiving a request to record user data,<br>
the method may comprise recording the user data in<br>
priority to the performing the first formatting process<br>
or the second formatting process.<br>
The method may further comprise resuming the<br>
first formatting process after recording the user data<br>
if the first formatting process is not complete. The<br>
method may further comprise resuming the second<br>
formatting process after recording the user data if the<br>
first formatting process is complete.<br>
In some embodiments, the method further<br>
comprises: recording predetermined data on the first<br>
recording layer at a position immediately after recorded<br>
user data on receipt of a request to eject the recording<br>
medium.<br>

In some embodiments, the method further<br>
comprises: recording predetermined data on the second<br>
recording layer at the bit inverted addresses to the<br>
addresses of the predetermined data on the first<br>
recording layer.<br>
On receipt of a request to eject the recording<br>
medium, if an end position of the user data on the first<br>
recording layer is further in the radially outer<br>
direction of the recording medium than an end position<br>
of formatted data on the second recording layer, then<br>
the method may further comprise: performing a formatting<br>
process on the data area of the second recording layer<br>
so as to make the radial position of the end position of<br>
formatted data on the second recording layer correspond<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A description will now be given, with<br>
reference to the drawings, of embodiments according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatus according to first<br><br>
through fourth embodiments of the present invention. In<br>
FIG. 3, an optical disc 1 is a recording medium having a<br>
plurality of recording layers. In the embodiments, the<br>
disc 1 is a recordable recording medium having two<br>
recording layers that includes a dual-layer DVD+RW disc.<br>
The information recording and reproducing apparatus is<br>
an optical disc apparatus that performs recording and<br>
reproduction with respect to the optical disc 1 having<br>
the two recording layers.<br>
A spindle motor 2 is a motor for rotating the<br>
optical disc 1 at predetermined rotation speeds when<br>
recording and reproducing data, respectively. A<br>
rotation control part 3 controls rotation of the motor 2.<br>
An optical pickup 4 is a device that emits and<br>
irradiates a laser light L at a predetermined recording<br>
power when recording data on the optical disc 1 or<br>
reproducing data from the optical disc 1. An actuator<br>
control part 5 controls to move the optical pickup 4<br>
when performing focusing and tracking on the optical<br>
disc 1. A signal control part 6 controls a reproduction<br>
signal output from the optical pickup 4 and a recording<br>
signal output to the optical pickup 4.<br>
A drive controller 7 is achieved by a<br>
microcomputer comprising a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, etc. The<br>
drive controller 7 controls the entire information<br><br>
recording and reproducing apparatus, and also performs a<br>
function of means including formatting means according<br>
to the present invention. A buffer memory 8 is a memory<br>
used as a temporarily storage area that is used by the<br>
drive controller 7 to store data. A laser drive circuit<br>
9 drives a laser of the optical pickup 4 to emit the<br>
Taser light L. An external interface 10 is used for<br>
transmitting/receiving commands and data to/from a host<br>
computer 11. The host computer 11 incorporates therein<br>
a control part that is realized by a microcomputer<br>
comprising a CPU, a ROM, a RAM, etc. The host computer<br>
11 is an information processing apparatus such as a<br>
personal computer that controls the information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatus.<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the drive controller 7 controls a formatting process<br>
performed on the optical disc 1 so that the formatting<br>
process is started from a second layer of which turn of<br>
recording is last and the formatting is progressed to a<br>
first recording layer of which turn of recording is<br>
earlier than the first recording layer.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart of a disc eject process<br>
according to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention performed in the information recording and<br><br>
reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Upon receipt of a format command from the host<br>
computer 11 in step Si, the drive controller 7 records,<br>
in step S2, a zone of a lead-in area of the first<br>
recording layer of the optical disc 1, and sends a<br>
notification of completion of formatting process to the<br>
host computer 1 and receives a disc access request from<br>
the host computer 1.<br>
The drive controller 7 determines whether<br>
there is a user data recording request from the host<br>
computer 1. If it is determined in step S3 that there<br>
is a user data recording request from the host computer<br>
1, the routine proceeds to step S10 so as to records<br>
user data received from the host computer 1 from a data<br>
area of the first' recording layer. When the entire data<br>
area of the first recording layer has been recorded,<br>
recording is performed on a data area of the second<br>
recording layer. The data recording in the data area of<br>
the first recording layer is performed in a direction<br>
from an inner side to an outer side of the optical disc<br>
1, and the data recording in the data area of the second<br>
recording layer is performed in a direction from the<br>
outer side to the inner side of the optical disc 1. If<br>
it is determined, in step S3, that there is no user data<br>
recording request, it is determined, in step S4, whether<br><br>
or not there is a disc eject request from the host<br>
computer 1.<br>
If it is determined, in step S4, that there is<br>
no disc eject request from the host computer 1, the<br>
routine proceeds to step Sll where it is determined<br>
whether or not the formatting process of the data area<br>
of the second recording layer has been completed. If it<br>
is determined, in step Sll, that the formatting process<br>
of the data area of the second recording layer has been<br>
completed, the routine proceeds to step S12. In step<br>
S12, a formatting process of the recording area of the<br>
first recording layer is started so as to record data in<br>
a direction from the inner side to the outer side of the<br>
optical disc 1, and the routine returns to step S3. If<br>
it is determined in step Sll that the formatting process<br>
of the data area of the second recording layer has not<br>
been completed, the routine proceeds to step S13. In<br>
step S13, a formatting process of the recording area of<br>
the second recording layer is started so as to record<br>
data in a direction from the outer side to the inner<br>
side of the optical disc 1, and the routine returns to<br>
step S3. On the other hand, if it is determined in step<br>
S4 that there is a disc eject request from the host<br>
computer 1, the routine proceeds to step S5 so as to<br>
determine whether or not it is in the middle of<br><br>
formatting (in background). The middle of formatting<br>
mentioned here does not mean a state where a formatting<br>
process is performed when a determination is made but<br>
means a state where a formatting process has not been<br>
completed over an entire data area.<br>
If it is determined, in step S5, that it is<br>
not in the middle of formatting, the routine proceeds to<br>
step S8. In step S8, dummy data is recorded in an<br>
unrecorded recording area of the data area and the lead-<br>
in area and the lead-out area are recorded. Then, in<br>
step S9, the optical disc 1 is ejected, and the process<br>
at this time is ended. If it is determined, in step S5,<br>
that it is in the middle of formatting, it is determined,<br>
in step S6, whether or not it is in the middle of<br>
recording of user data. The middle of recording of user<br>
data mentioned here does not mean a state where a user<br>
data recording is performed when a determination is made<br>
but means a state where a user data recording process<br>
has not been completed over an entire area which has not<br>
been subjected to a formatting process among the data<br>
areas.<br>
If it is determined, in step S6, that it is in<br>
the middle of the user data recording, the•routine<br>
proceeds to step S7. In step S7, data of the temporary<br>
middle zone (TMZ) is recorded from the last recorded<br><br>
position of the user data. Then, in step S8, dummy data<br>
is recorded in an unrecorded area of the data area and<br>
the lead-in area and the lead-out area are recorded.<br>
Then, in step S9, the optical disc 1 is ejected, and the<br>
process at this time is ended.<br>
FIGS. 5 through 7 are illustrations for<br>
explaining a disc eject process according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention performed in the<br>
information recording and reproducing apparatus shown in<br>
FIG. 3.<br>
The optical disc 1 comprises a first recording<br>
layer 20 and a second recording layer 21 as shown in FIG.<br>
5. The first recording layer 20 includes a lead-in area<br>
22, a data area 23 and a middle zone 24 arranged in that<br>
order from an inner side toward an outer side of the<br>
optical disc 1. The second recording layer 21 includes<br>
a middle zone 25, a data area 26 and a lead-out area 27<br>
arranged in that order from the outer side toward the<br>
inner side of the optical disc 1. In FIG. 5, the lead-<br>
in area 22 and the lead-out area 27, the data areas 26<br>
and 23, and the middle zones 25 and 24 are located in<br>
the same radial positions of the optical disc 1,<br>
respectively.<br>
That is, the start address of the lead-in area<br>
22 and the end address of the lead-out area 27, and the<br><br>
end address of the lead-in area 22 and the start address<br>
of the lead-out area 27 are in the same radial position<br>
of the optical disc 1, respectively. Similarly, the<br>
start address of the data area 23 and the end address of<br>
the data area 2 6, and the end address of the data area<br>
23 and the start address of the data area 26 are in the<br>
same radial positions, respectively. The start address<br>
of the middle zone 24 and the end address of the middle<br>
zone 25, and the end address of the middle zone 24 and<br>
the end address of the middle zone 25 are in the same<br>
radial positions, respectively. The above-mentioned<br>
corresponding start addresses and end addresses are at<br>
bit inversion values, respectively. It will be<br>
appreciated that in an optical disc such as that shown<br>
in the figures, two addresses at corresponding radial<br>
positions on different recording layers of the disc will<br>
be bit inverted with respect to each other. Therefore,<br>
it will be appreciated that all references to areas on<br>
recording areas on different layers having corresponding<br>
radial positions also refer to the areas having bit-<br>
inverted addresses.<br>
Upon receipt of a format command from the host<br>
computer 11 after the optical disc 1 is loaded, the<br>
drive controller 7 records an initial zone 30 of the<br>
lead-in area 22. After completion of the recording, the<br><br>
drive controller 7 sends a notification of completion of<br>
the formatting to the host computer 11, and, then,<br>
receives a disc access for recording or reproduction<br>
from the host computer while performing a formatting<br>
process of the data areas 23 and 26 at a time when there<br>
is no access from the host computer 11. Upon reception<br>
of the disc access, the drive controller 7 determines<br>
whether or not there is a request of recording user data<br>
from the host computer 11. If there is a request of<br>
recording user data, recording of user data is performed<br>
from the inner side toward the outer side of the data<br>
area 23 of the first recording layer.<br>
On the other hand, if there is no request for<br>
recording user data, the drive controller determines<br>
whether or not there is a request for ejecting the disc.<br>
If there is no request for ejecting the disc, the drive<br>
controller 7 determines whether or not a formatting<br>
process of the second recording layer 21 of the optical<br>
disc 1 has been completed with reference to a bitmap<br>
recorded in the lead-in area 22. If the formatting<br>
process of the second recording layer 21 has not been<br>
completed yet, the drive controller 7 starts the<br>
formatting process of the data area 26 of the second<br>
recording layer 21 from the outer side and continues the<br>
formatting process toward the inner side of the optical<br><br>
disc 1.<br>
On the other hand if the formatting process of<br>
the second recording layer 21 has been completed, a<br>
formatting process,of the first recording layer 20 is<br>
performed. Here, if user data is not recorded in the<br>
data area 23 of the first recording layer 20, the<br>
formatting process is started from the start address on<br>
the inner side of the data area 23 and continues the<br>
formatting process toward the end address on the outer<br>
side of the data area 23. If the user data is recorded<br>
in a part of the data area 23, the formatting process is<br>
started at the last recording position of the user data<br>
and continues the formatting process toward the end<br>
address.<br>
Then, when a request for ejecting the optical<br>
disc 1 out of the host computer 11 is made, and if only<br>
the area 31 of the second recording layer 21 is<br>
formatted and the formatting is still continuing and<br>
user data has been recorded in an area 32 of the first<br>
recording layer 20 as shown in FIG. 6, the last recorded<br>
position of the user data in the data area 23 and the<br>
end position of the formatting in the data area 26 are<br>
obtained so as to record data of TMZ in an area 33<br>
immediately after the area 32 of the first recording<br>
layer 20 and record data of TMZ in an area 34 in the<br><br>
second recording layer 21. Further, dummy data is<br>
recorded in an unrecorded area 35 in the second<br>
recording layer 21, and the read-in area 22 and the<br>
lead-out area 27 are recorded, and, thereafter, the<br>
optical disc 1 is ejected. In other embodiments, only<br>
data of TMZ in an area 33 immediately after the area 32<br>
of the first recording layer 20 is recorded, and no data<br>
of TMZ is recorded in the second recording layer 21.<br>
As mentioned above, by performing the<br>
formatting process of the optical disc from the second<br>
recording layer of which recording order of user data is<br>
later, a time spent on ejecting the optical disc, when a<br>
request for ejecting the optical disc is made in the<br>
middle of formatting of in the middle of recording user<br>
data, can be shortened, thereby reducing a time for<br>
ejecting the optical- disc.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
A description will be given of a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the second embodiment, the drive controller<br>
7 controls the formatting process of each of the<br>
recording layers 20 and 21 of the optical disc 1 to be<br>
started from the inner side. FIG. 8 is a flowchart of a<br>
disc eject process according to the second embodiment of<br>
the present invention performed in the information<br><br>
recording and reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Upon receipt of a format command from the host<br>
computer 11 after the optical disc 1 is loaded in step<br>
S21, the drive controller 7 records, in step S22, an<br>
initial zone of the lead-in area of the first recording<br>
layer of the optical disc 1. After completion of the<br>
recording, the drive controller 7 sends a notification<br>
of completion of the formatting to the host computer 11,<br>
and, then, receives a request of accessing a disc for<br>
recording or reproduction from the host computer 11.<br>
Then, the drive controller 7 determines, in<br>
step S23, whether or not there is a request of recording<br>
user data from the host computer 11. If there is a<br>
request of recording user data, recording of user data<br>
received from the host computer 11 is performed, in step<br>
S30, from the data area of the first recording layer 20.<br>
After the data area of the first recording layer 20 is<br>
recorded, the user data is recorded in the data area of<br>
the second recording layer 21.<br>
On the other hand, if it is determined, in<br>
step S23, that there is no request for recording user<br>
data, the drive controller 7 determines, in step S24,<br>
whether or not there is a request for ejecting the disc.<br>
If it is determined, in step S24, that there is no<br>
request for ejecting the disc, the drive controller 7<br><br>
determines, in step S31, whether or not a formatting<br>
process of the second recording layer 21 of the optical<br>
disc 1 has been completed.<br>
If it is determined, in step S31, that the<br>
formatting process of the data area of the second<br>
recording layer has been completed, the routine proceeds<br>
to step S32. In step S32, a formatting process of the<br>
recording area of the first recording layer is started<br>
so as to record data in a direction from the inner side<br>
to the outer side of the optical disc 1, and the routine<br>
returns to step S23.<br>
If it is determined in step S31 that the<br>
formatting process of the data area of the second<br>
recording layer has not been completed, the routine<br>
proceeds to step S33. In step S33, a formatting process<br>
of the recording area of the second recording layer is<br>
started so as to record data in a direction from the<br>
outer side to the inner side of the optical disc 1 by a<br>
predetermined amount of data, and the routine returns to<br>
step S33. The predetermined amount of data is a<br>
previously set recording unit, and the data is recorded<br>
from the outer side to the inner side by the recording<br>
unit. That is to say that in step S33, the formatting<br>
process on the recording area of the second recording<br>
layer is performed in recording increments. Within each<br><br>
recording increment, the formatting is performed along a<br>
path from the outer side to the inner side of the<br>
recording area of the second recording layer, and the<br>
recording increments are along a path from the inner<br>
side to the outer side of the recording area.<br>
On the other hand, if it is determined in step<br>
S24 that there is a disc eject request from the host<br>
computer 11, the routine proceeds to step S25 so as to<br>
determine whether or not it is in the middle of<br>
formatting (in background). The middle of. formatting<br>
mentioned here does not mean a state where a formatting<br>
process is performed when a determination is made but<br>
means a state where a formatting process has not been<br>
completed over an entire data area. If it is determined,<br>
in step S25, that it is not in the middle of formatting,<br>
the routine proceeds to step S28. In step S28, the<br>
lead-in area and the lead-out area are recorded. Then,<br>
in step S29, the optical disc 1 is ejected, and the<br>
process at this time is ended.<br>
If it is determined, in step S25, that it is<br>
in the middle of formatting, it is determined, in step<br>
S26, whether or not it is in the middle of recording of<br>
user data. The middle of recording of user data<br>
mentioned here does not mean a state where a user data<br>
recording is performed when a determination is made but<br><br>
means a state where a user data recording process has<br>
not been completed over an entire area which has not<br>
been subjected to a formatting process among the data<br>
areas. If it is determined, in step S26, that it is not<br>
in the middle of the user data recording, the routine<br>
proceeds to step S28. In step S28, the lead-in area and<br>
the lead-out area are recorded. Then, in step S29, the<br>
optical disc 1 is ejected, and the process at this time<br>
is ended.<br>
If it is determined, in step S26, that it is<br>
in the middle of the user data recording, the routine<br>
proceeds to step S27. In step S27, data of the<br>
temporary middle zone (TMZ) is recorded from the last<br>
recorded position of the user data. Then, in step S28,<br>
the lead-in area and the lead-out area are recorded.<br>
Then, in step S29, the optical disc 1 is ejected, and<br>
the process at this time is ended.<br>
FIG. 9 and FIG. 10 are illustrations for<br>
explaining a disc eject process according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention in the information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 3. In<br>
FIGS. 9 and 10, parts that are the same as the parts<br>
shown in FIGS. 6 through 8 are given the same reference<br>
numerals, and description thereof will be omitted.<br>
Upon receipt of a format command from the host<br><br>
computer 11 after the optical disc 1 is loaded, the<br>
drive controller 7 records an initial zone 30 of the<br>
lead-in area 22 as shown in FIG. 9. After completion of<br>
the recording, the drive controller 7 sends a<br>
notification of completion of the formatting to the host<br>
computer 11, and, then, receives a disc access for<br>
recording or reproduction from the host computer 11<br>
while performing a formatting process of the data areas<br>
23 and 26 at a time when there is no access from the<br>
host computer 11. Upon reception of the disc access,<br>
the drive controller 7 determines whether or not there<br>
is a request of recording user data from the host<br>
computer 11. If there is a request of recording user<br>
data, recording of user data is performed from the inner<br>
side toward the outer side of the data area 23 of the<br>
first recording layer.<br>
On the other hand, if there is no request for<br>
recording user data, the drive controller 7 determines<br>
whether or not there is a request for ejecting the disc.<br>
If there is no request for ejecting the disc, the drive<br>
controller 7 determines whether or not a formatting<br>
process of the second recording layer 21 of the optical<br>
disc 1 has been completed with reference to a bitmap<br>
recorded in the lead-in area 22. If the formatting<br>
process of the second recording layer 21 has not been<br><br>
completed yet, the drive controller 7 starts the<br>
formatting process of the data area 26 of the second<br>
recording layer 21 sequentially in an order of an area<br>
36 and an area of 37, which have the same amount of data,<br>
from the outer side and continues the formatting process<br>
toward the inner side of the optical disc 1. It should<br>
be noted that the formatting process is progressed in<br>
each of the area 36 and the area 37 in a direction from<br>
the outer side toward the inner side.<br>
On the other hand, if the formatting process<br>
of the second recording layer 21 has been completed, a<br>
formatting process of the first recording layer 20 is<br>
performed in the same manner as mentioned above. Here,<br>
if user data is not recorded in the data area 23 of the<br>
first recording layer 20, the formatting process is<br>
started from the start address on the inner side of the<br>
data area 23 and the formatting process is progressed<br>
toward the end address on the outer side of the data<br>
area 23. If the user data is recorded in a part of the<br>
data area 23, the formatting process is started at the<br>
last recording position of the user data and the<br>
formatting process is progressed toward the end address.<br>
Then, when a request for ejecting the optical<br>
disc 1 out of the host computer 11 is made, and if only<br>
the areas 36 and 37 of the second recording layer 21 are<br><br>
formatted and the formatting is still continuing and<br>
user data has been recorded in an area 38 of the first<br>
recording layer 20 and if the last recorded position of<br>
the user data and the format end position are at the<br>
same radial position of the optical disc as shown in FIG.<br>
10, the last recorded position of the user data in the<br>
data area 23 and the end position of the formatting in<br>
the data area 26 are obtained. Then, if it is<br>
determined that both are at the same radial position,<br>
data of TMZ is recorded in an area 39 immediately after<br>
the area 38 of the first recording layer 20 and data of<br>
TMZ is recorded in an area 40 in the second recording<br>
layer 21. It should be noted that the area 39 and the<br>
area 40 are at the same radial position. It also should<br>
be noted that the addresses of area 39 and the area 40<br>
are bit-inverted with respect to each other. Then, the<br>
read-in area 22 and the lead-out area 27 are recorded,<br>
and, thereafter, the optical disc 1 is ejected. In<br>
other embodiments, data of TMZ is recorded in an area 39<br>
immediately after the area 38 of the first recording<br>
layer 20, but no data of TMZ is recorded in the second<br>
recording layer 21.<br>
As mentioned above, since the user data is<br>
recorded from the inner side of the first recording<br>
layer, there is no need to format the entire area of the<br><br>
first and second recording layers if an amount of user<br>
data to be recorded is small, and, thereby a time until<br>
the optical disc is ejected can be reduced.<br>
(Third Embodiment)<br>
A description will now be given of a third<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the third embodiment, the drive controller<br>
7 obtains the last recorded position of the first<br>
recording layer of the optical disc 1 in which data has<br>
been recorded when an instruction to eject the optical<br>
disc 1 is made by the host computer 11. Then, if the<br>
drive controller 7 determines that the formatting in the<br>
second recording layer has been completed to a position<br>
corresponding to the above-mentioned last recorded<br>
position, the drive controller 7 controls to eject the<br>
optical disc 1 after recording TMZ (corresponding to<br>
predetermined data) at a position immediately after the<br>
last recorded position in the first recording layer<br>
which has the above-mentioned last recorded position,<br>
and at a position immediately after the position<br>
corresponding to the last recorded position in the<br>
second recording layer in which the data has not been<br>
recorded.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart of a disc eject process<br>
according to the third embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention performed in the information recording and<br>
reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The drive controller 7 determines, in step S41,<br>
whether or not there is a disc eject request issued from<br>
the host computer 11. If there is no disc eject request,<br>
the process is ended. If there is a disc eject request,<br>
the drive controller 7 controls, in step S42, to record<br>
TMZ in the data area of the first recording layer from<br>
the last recorded position, and also record TMZ in the<br>
second recording layer at a position corresponding to<br>
the position where the TMZ is recorded in the first<br>
recording layer, and record the lead-in area and the<br>
lead-out area. In other embodiments, a TMZ only needs<br>
to be recorded on the first recording layer, and no TMZ<br>
is recorded in the second recording layer. Then, the<br>
drive controller 7 controls, in step S43, to eject the<br>
optical disc 1, and ends the process at this time.<br>
FIGS. 12 through 14 are illustrations for<br>
explaining the disc eject process according to the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention performed in the<br>
information recording and reproducing apparatus shown in<br>
FIG. 3. In FIGS. 12 through 14, parts that are the same<br>
as the parts shown in FIGS. 5 through 7 are given the<br>
same reference numerals, and descriptions thereof will<br>
be omitted.<br><br>
If a formatting process of the second<br>
recording layer 21 has not been completed yet, the drive<br>
controller 7 controls to perform the formatting process<br>
on an area 41, an area 42 and an area 43, each of which<br>
has the same predetermined capacity and arranged in that<br>
order in the data area 2 6 of the second recording layer<br>
21, sequentially from the inner side toward the outer<br>
side as shown in FIG. 12. The areas 41, 42 and 43 are<br>
recording increments. The direction of progressing the<br>
formatting process in each of the areas 41 to 43 is from<br>
the outer side toward the inner side.<br>
Then, when a request of ejecting the optical<br>
disc 1 is issued by the host computer 11, the user data<br>
last recorded position in the data area 23 and the<br>
format end position in the data area 26 are obtained if<br>
only the areas 41 through 43 have been formatted and the<br>
formatting of the second recording layer 21 has not been<br>
completed yet as shown in FIG. 13, the user data is<br>
recorded in an area 44 of the first recording layer 20,<br>
the user data last recorded position and the format end<br>
position are at different positions along a radial<br>
direction and an area at the position corresponding to<br>
the area 44 in the first recording layer 20 in a radial<br>
direction has been formatted. It will be appreciated<br>
that if the user data last recorded position and the<br><br>
format end position are at different positions along a<br>
radial direction, then they will not be at bit-inverted<br>
addresses. Then, if the drive controller 7 determines<br>
that the formatting process has been progressed to the<br>
position corresponding to the area 44 in the data area<br>
26 in accordance with the both positions, the drive<br>
controller 7 controls to record data of TMZ in an area<br>
45	immediately after the area 44 of the first recording<br>
layer 20 and also record data of TMZ in an area 46 of<br>
the second recording layer 21. The area 45 and the area<br>
46	are at the same position along a radial direction of<br>
the optical disc 1 (i.e. at bit-inverted addressed), and,<br>
thus, the area 4 6 is overwritten on the formatted area.<br>
In other embodiments, a TMZ need not be recorded in an<br>
area 4 6 of the second recording layer 21. Then, the<br>
lead-in area 22 and the lead-out area 27 are recorded,<br>
and the optical disc 1 is ejected.<br>
As mentioned above, when a request of ejecting<br>
an optical disc is issued to the information recording<br>
and reproducing apparatus, and if the format end<br>
position of the second recording layer is on the outer<br>
side than the user data last recorded position of the<br>
first recording layer 1, there is no need to perform<br>
dummy data recording from the user data last recorded<br>
position of the first recording layer to the formatting<br><br>
start position of the second recording layer, thereby<br>
reducing a time to eject the optical disc.<br>
(Fourth Embodiment)<br>
A description will now be given of a fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the fourth embodiment, when an instruction<br>
of ejecting the optical disc 1 is issued by the host<br>
computer 11, the drive controller 7 obtains the last<br>
recorded position in the first recording layer 20 of the<br>
optical disc 1 in which data is recorded, and also<br>
obtains the format end position in the second recording<br>
layer in which data is not recorded. Then, if the drive<br>
controller 7 determines that an area of the first<br>
recording layer from the above-mentioned last recorded<br>
position to the above-mentioned format end position is<br>
an unrecorded area with respect to the first recording<br>
layer having the above-mentioned last recorded position,<br>
the drive controller 7 controls to record dummy data in<br>
the area from the above-mentioned last recorded position<br>
to the above-mentioned format end position with respect<br>
to the first recording layer having the last recorded<br>
position, and, record TMZ (corresponding to<br>
predetermined data) immediately after the recorded dummy<br>
data in the first recording layer and immediately after<br>
the format end position in the second recording layer,<br><br>
and, thereafter eject the optical disc 1.<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart of a disc eject process<br>
according to the fourth embodiment of the present<br>
invention performed in the information recording and<br>
reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The drive controller 7 determines, in step S51,<br>
whether or not there is a disc eject request issued from<br>
the host computer 11. If there is no disc eject request,<br>
then, the process at this time is ended. If there is a<br>
disc eject request, the drive controller 7 determines,<br>
in step S52, whether or not a difference between the<br>
user data last recorded position in the first recording<br>
area and the format end position in the second recording<br>
layer is equal to or greater than a predetermined value.<br>
The predetermined value is preferably set to, for<br>
example, 4,400 sectors which correspond to the length of<br>
the middle zone.<br>
If it is determined, in step S52, that the<br>
difference between the user data end recorded position<br>
and the format end position is equal to or greater than<br>
the predetermined value, TMZ is recorded, in step S53,<br>
from the user data last recorded position in the data<br>
area of the first recording layer, and the lead-in area<br>
and the lead-out area are recorded. Then, the optical<br>
disc 1 is ejected in step S56, and, then, the process at<br><br>
this time is ended.<br>
If it is determined, in step S52, that the<br>
difference between the user data end recorded position<br>
and the format end position is not equal to or greater<br>
than the predetermined value (less than the<br>
predetermined value), the routine proceeds to step S54.<br>
In step S54, dummy data is recorded in a recording area<br>
of a range from the user data last recorded position in<br>
the data area of the first recording layer to a position<br>
corresponding to the format end position of the data<br>
area of the second recording layer (a position in the<br>
first recording layer at the same position in a radial<br>
direction as the format end position of the second<br>
recording layer, i.e. at the bit-inverted address).<br>
Then, in step S55, TMZ is recorded and the lead-in area<br>
and the lead-out area are recorded. Thereafter, the<br>
optical disc 1 is ejected in step S56, and the process<br>
at this time is ended. In S55, the TMZ could be recorded<br>
only the data area of the first recording or on the data<br>
areas of both the first and second recording layers.<br>
FIG. 16 is an illustration for explaining the<br>
disc eject process according to the fourth embodiment of<br>
the present invention performed in the information<br>
recording and reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 3. In<br>
FIG. 16, parts that are the same as the parts shown in<br><br>
FIGS. 12 through 14 are given the same reference<br>
numerals, and descriptions thereof will be omitted.<br>
The user data last recorded position in the<br>
data area 23 and the format end position in the data<br>
area 26 are obtained if only the areas 41 through 43 of<br>
the second recording layer 21 have been formatted and<br>
the user data is recorded in the area 44 of the first<br>
recording layer 20 and the user data last recorded<br>
position and the format end position are at different<br>
positions along a radial direction and an area at the<br>
position corresponding to the area 44 in the first<br>
recording layer 20 in a radial direction has been<br>
formatted. Then, the drive controller 7 compares the<br>
both positions and if it is determined that an<br>
unrecorded area 47 corresponding to a difference<br>
therebetween is less than the length of the middle zone<br>
(for example, 4,400 sectors), the drive controller 7<br>
controls to record dummy data in the unrecorded area 47<br>
and also records the data of TMZ in an area 48<br>
immediately after the unrecorded area 47 and an are 4 9<br>
immediately before the recording area 4 3 of the second<br>
recording layer 21. Then, after the lead-in area 22 and<br>
the lead-out area 27 are recorded, the optical disc 1 is<br>
ejected.<br>
On the other hand, if the derive controller 7<br><br>
FIGS. 12 through 14 are given the same reference<br>
numerals, and descriptions thereof will be omitted.<br>
The user data last recorded position in the<br>
data area 23 and the format end position in the data<br>
area 26 are obtained if only the areas 41 through 43 of<br>
the second recording layer 21 have been formatted and<br>
the user data is recorded in the area 44 of the first<br>
recording layer 20 and the user data last recorded<br>
position and the format end position are at different<br>
positions along a radial direction and an area at the<br>
position corresponding to the area 44 in the first<br>
recording layer 20 in a radial direction has been<br>
formatted. Then, the drive controller 7 compares the<br>
both positions and if it is determined that an<br>
unrecorded area 47 corresponding to a difference<br>
therebetween is less than the length of the middle zone<br>
(for example, 4,400 sectors), the drive controller 7<br>
controls to record dummy data in the unrecorded area 47<br>
and also records the data of TMZ in an area 48<br>
immediately after the unrecorded area 47 and an are 49<br>
immediately before the recording area 43 of the second<br>
recording layer 21. Then, after the lead-in area 22 and<br>
the lead-out area 27 are recorded, the optical disc 1 is<br>
ejected.<br>
On the other hand, if the derive controller 7<br><br>
determines that the unrecorded area 47 is equal to or<br>
longer tan the length of the middle zone, the data of<br>
TMZ is recorded in the area immediately after the area<br>
44 of the first recording layer 21 and the area of the<br>
same position in a radial direction in the second<br>
recording layer 21, and the lead-in area 22 and the<br>
lead-out area 27 are recorded, and the optical disc 1 is<br>
ejected.<br>
It should be noted that, in the above-<br>
mentioned process, if it is determined that the length<br>
of the formatted area (areas 41 to 43) is shorter than<br>
the length of the area 44 already recorded in the data<br>
area 23 based on the user data last recorded position in<br>
the data area 23 and the format end position of the data<br>
area 26, dummy data may be recorded in the unrecorded<br>
area 47 corresponding to the difference between the user<br>
data last recorded position in the data area 23 and the<br>
position in the first recording layer 20 corresponding<br>
to the format end position, and the data of TMZ is<br>
recorded in the area 4 9 immediately before the recording<br>
area 43 of the second recording layer 21, and the lead-<br>
in area 22 and the lead-out area 27 are recorded and,<br>
thereafter, the optical disc 1 is ejected.<br>
As mentioned above, if the format end position<br>
of the second recording layer and the user data last<br><br>
recorded position of the first recording layer are not<br>
at the same position along a radial direction of the<br>
optical disc 1, the unrecorded area of the first<br>
recording area is caused to be already recorded in<br>
response to the formatted area of the second recording<br>
layer. Thus, the formatted area of the second recording<br>
layer can be recognized as an already formatted area<br>
even after the optical disc is ejected, and, thereby,<br>
the formatting process of the second recording layer is<br>
not be wasted.<br>
It should be noted that the data of the<br>
temporary middle zone (TMZ) recorded when ejecting the<br>
dual-layer DVD+RW disc in the above-mentioned<br>
embodiments may be dummy data.<br>
Additionally, although the case of the optical<br>
disc having two recording layers was explained in the<br>
above embodiments, the present invention is applicable<br>
to an optical disc having more than two recording layers<br>
in the same manner.<br>
The information recording and reproducing<br>
apparatus according to the present invention is used<br>
with a recording medium having a plurality of recording<br>
layers that is detachably attached thereto, and the<br>
present invention is applicable to an apparatus that<br>
performs recording and reproduction on such as recording<br><br>
medium.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically disclosed embodiments, and variations and<br>
modifications may be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The present application is based on Japanese<br>
priority application No. 2005-071456 filed March 14,<br>
2005, the entire contents of which are hereby<br>
