SPECIFICATION PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF BENZYLOXYPYRROLIDINE, AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF HYDROCHLORIDE SALT POWDER OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE<br>
BENZYLOXYPYRROLIDINE DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, and a process for production of a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Benzyloxypyrrolidine derivatives, above all, optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivatives are useful compounds as various medicine intermediates, and many processes for production thereof have been known. In particular, when used as a starting material for a medical product, it is essential to procure a high-purity substance, [0003]<br>
First, a process for production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative will be described. It is a general method that a nitrogen-containing cyclic alcohol derivative is reacted with benzyl halide in a basic condition. As specific examples, a<br>
 <br>
reaction of l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3-hydroxypyrrolidine with benzyl halide is mentioned.  In this reaction, halogenation is carried out with benzyl bromide in the presence of sodium hydride (Patent document 1, Non-patent document 1), but it can be said that implementation in an industrial scale is difficult because of using combustible substances such as sodium hydride. Further, as a method for production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative by benzylation of a piperinol derivative, a reaction example in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide catalyst is reported (Patent document 2) , there is used a benzyl chloride of 11.5 times by mole under solvent-free condition and implementation' in an industrial scale is economically difficult. [0004]<br>
Further, as a process for production of a hydrochloride of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, there is a report that 3 times by mole of 4 M hydrogen chloride-dioxane solution was added to an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, and after 2 hours, toluene was added to a concentrated residue to try crystallization (Patent document 3) . However, the hydrochloride of an optically active 3-benzyloxypyrroline derivative obtained by this method is described as syrup. As disclosed above, it is difficult to isolate hydrochloride of an optically active 3-benzyloxypyrroline derivative as powder due to very high<br>
 <br>
hygroscopic property. [0005]<br>
As described above, there has been found no example of reports on industrial processes of production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative and hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, and further, there has been found no example of reports on a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
Benzyloxypyrrolidine derivatives are useful intermediates; in particular, importance of optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivatives as medicine intermediates has been widely recognized.  Further, it has been desired that an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative is highly<br>
 <br>
purified by converting it into hydrochloride. However, in the conventional techniques, there has been no example of reports on production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative in an industrial scale, and further, there has been known that it is difficult to produce hydrochloride of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative industrially, in particular, hydrochloride of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative. Hence, it has been strongly desired to create an industrial process for production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative in safety and high efficiency, and an industrial process for production of a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, [0007]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative in high yield and safety.  Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a process for production of a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, and the process for production in high yield and safety.<br>

 <br>
wherein R1 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group and iii) aryl group; R2 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkenyloxy group having carbon numbers of from 2 to 4, iv) aralkyloxy group having one benzene ring, v) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and vi) aryl group having one benzene ring; and a hydroxyl group may be either 2 or 3 position of pyrrolidine ring; In reacting a pyrrolidinol derivative represented by the general formula (1) with a benzyl halide derivative in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide, the present invention is a process for production of a benzyloxypyrrolidine<br>
 <br>
derivative expressed by the general formula (2), wherein the<br>
reaction is carried out in either of the following conditions<br>
A or B;<br>

 <br>
wherein R1 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group and iii) aryl group; and R2 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkenyloxy group having carbon numbers of from 2 to 4, iv) aralkyloxy group having one benzene ring, v) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and vi) aryl group having one benzene ring; R3 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and iv) halogen group. [0032]<br>
In the present invention, a pyrrolidinol derivative represented by the general formula (1) is used:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein R1 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group and iii) aryl group; R2 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkenyloxy group having carbon numbers of from 2 to 4, iv) aralkyloxy group having one benzene ring, v) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and vi) aryl group having one benzene ring; and a hydroxyl group may be either 2 or 3 position of pyrrolidine ring; and it may be racemic body or optically active substance.  Specific examples can include l-formyl-2-pyrrolidinol, 1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-pyrrolidinol,<br>
l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3-pyrrolinol, optically active l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3(S)-pyrrolidinol, optically active l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3(R)-pyrrolidinol-1-allyloxycarbonyl-3-pyrrolidinol, 1-benzyloxycarbony1-3-pyrrolidinol, 1-acetyl-3-pyrrolidinol, 1-benzyl-3-pyrrrolidinol, 1-formyl-3-methy1-2-pyrrolidinol, l-ethoxycarbonyl-2-n-propyl-3-pyrrolidinol, 1-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-phenyl-3-pyrrolidinol,<br>
 <br>
1-allyloxycarbonyl-2-methyl-3-pyrrolidinol, and l-benzyloxycarbonyl-2-n-butyl-3-pyrrolidinol, Above all, preferable are 1-tert-butoxycarbony1-3-pyrrolidinol, 1-tert-butoxycarbony1-2-pyrrolidinol, optically active l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3(S)-pyrrolidinol and optically active l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3(R)-pyrrolidinol. [0035]<br>
As an alkali metal hydroxide used in the present invention, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide is preferably mentioned. As the alkali metal hydroxide, it may be used as a solid of pellet or flake as it is, or an aqueous solution that is easily handled industrially may be used.  In the case of using it as an aqueous solution, the concentration is not particularly limited, but generally, the concentration of alkali metal hydroxide in the aqueous solution is preferably from 10 to 60% by weight, and more preferably from 20 to 50% by weight. The more the used amount of alkali metal hydroxide is, more advantageously the reaction proceeds, but when too much, a problem of operation such as increase in viscosity of reaction liquid is thought. It is preferably from 1 to 10 times by mole based on the pyrrolidinol derivative, more preferably from 2 to 8 times by mole, and further preferably from 2 to 5 times by mole. [0036]<br>
The benzyl halide derivative used in the present invention has one benzene ring, and as specific examples, there<br>
 <br>
are listed benzyl chloride, benzyl bromide, 3-chloromethyltoluene, 3-bromomethyltoluene, 4-chloromethyl-3-ethylbenzene, 3-chloromethylanisole, 4-bromomethylanisole, p-chlorobenzyl chloride and the like. Benzyl chloride and benzyl bromide are preferable.  The used amount of benzyl halide derivative is from 1 to 2 times by mole based on the pyrrolidinol derivative, preferably from 1 to 1.7 times by mole, and further preferably from 1.1 to 1.5 times by mole. When the used amount is small, it is not good because the conversion rate of pyrrolidinol derivative becomes lowered, whereas when too large, because the amount of by-product of dibenzylated pyrrolidine derivative and dibenzyl ether is increased, thus the above-described suitable range is preferable. [0037]<br>
Solvents used in the present invention are an aprotic polar solvent or an aliphatic ether solvent. [0038]<br>
As specific examples of the aprotic polar solvent, there are listed dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, formamide, acetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and the like, dimethylsulfoxide and N,N-dimethylformamide are preferable.  The used amount of the aprotic polar solvent is preferably 1. 0 times by weight or more based on the pyrrolidinol derivative, and more preferably 1.3<br>
 <br>
times by weight or more. A reaction system in the present invention may be a uniform system or slurry, but when less than 1. 0 times by mass, it becomes more concentrated reaction liquid, so that operability of stirring tends to be deteriorated. Further, the larger the used amount of the aprotic polar solvent is, the better the stirring condition is, but being too much invites an increase in the used amount of solvent and the lowering of productivity, thus 10 times by weight or less is preferable, and 3,0 times by weight or less is more preferable from the point of suppressing the used amount of solvent as much as possible. [0039]<br>
On the other hand, in the case of an aliphatic ether solvent, it is essential to use a phase transfer catalyst. As specific examples of the aliphatic ether solvent, there can be listed tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropirane, isopropyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether, diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane and the like, tetrahydrofuran is preferable.  The used amount of the aliphatic ether solvent is preferably 1.0 times by weight or more based on the pyrrolidinol derivative, but being too much invites an increase in the used amount of solvent and the lowering of productivity, thus 10 times by weight or less is preferable, and 3.0 times by weight or less is more preferable from the point of suppressing the used amount of solvent as much as possible.<br>
 <br>
Further, the coexistent phase transfer catalyst is not particularly limited, quaternary ammonium salt or quaternary phosphonium salt is mentioned.  Preferably, it is a quaternary ammonium salt expressed by the general formula (8): [0041] [Chemical formula 10]<br>
 <br>
wherein R4 to R7 represent the same or different alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 18, or a benzyl group, Y represents a halogen atom, a sulfuric acid ion, or a hydroxide ion. As the specific examples, there are preferably listed tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, tetra-n-butylammonium chloride, n-dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, n-dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, tetraethylammonium bromide, benzyltri-n-butylammonium chloride, benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, tetra-n-butylammonim sulfate, di-n-dodecyldimethylammonium chloride and the like; further preferable are tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, n-dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and tetra-n-butylammonim sulfate.  The used amount of the phase transfer catalyst is from 0 . 001 to 0 . 5 times by mole based on the pyrrolidinol derivative,<br>
 <br>
preferably from 0.005 to 0.3 times by mole, and further preferably from 0.01 to 0.10 times by mole.  In this range, it is possible to convert a pyrrolidinol derivative efficiently into a corresponding benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative. [0043]<br>
Further, in either an aprotic polar solvent or an aliphatic ether solvent, it may be a mixed solvent of water and thereof. The ratio of water in the solvent is not particularly limited, it is preferably from 1 to 80% by weight, and further preferably from 10 to 50% by weight. [0044]<br>
Regarding the reaction method, it is suitable to add a benzyl halide derivative after mixing of a pyrrolidinol derivative, a solvent and an alkali metal hydroxide, and in the case of an aliphatic ether solvent, further adding a phase-transfer solvent, in order to exhibit a maximum effect of the present invention. When an alkali metal hydroxide and water first contact a benzyl halide derivative, there is a tendency that benzyl alcohol or dibenzyl ether corresponding to a benzyl halide derivative generates in a large amount as by-product. The temperature that a benzyl halide derivative<br>
is added dropwise and the aging temperature are from 0 to 100°C, preferably from 0 to 70°C, and further preferably from 0 to 50°C. [0045]<br>
The thus obtained benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative is<br>
 <br>
expressed by the general formula (2): [0046] [Chemical formula 11]<br>
 <br>
wherein R1 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group and iii) aryl group; and R2 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkenyloxy group having carbon numbers of from 2 to 4, iv) aralkyloxy group having one benzene ring, v) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and vi) aryl group having one benzene ring; R3 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and iv) halogen group* As the specific example, there are listed l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine, l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine, l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4~methyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine, 1-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-phenyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine, l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-phenyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine, l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-n-butyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine, l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-n-butyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine, l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-n-butyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine,<br>
 <br>
l-ethoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidene,<br>
l-ethoxycarbonyl-4-methyl~3-benzyloxypyrrolidene,<br>
l-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidene,<br>
l-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidene,<br>
l-ethoxycarbonyl-4-ethyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidene,<br>
l-ethoxycarbonyl-5-ethyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidene,<br>
1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine and the like,<br>
l-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3-benzyloxypyrrolidine is preferable,<br>
and it may be a racemic body or an optically active substance.<br>
[0048]<br>
Next, by treating the benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative obtained by the above methods with an acid substance, it is possible to produce a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative expressed by the general formula (3): [0049] [Chemical formula 12]<br>
 <br>
wherein R1 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group and iii) aryl group; and R3 represents a group<br>
selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and iv) halogen group.<br>
 <br>
As an acid substance used here, there can be listed mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, and carboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid. Above all, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid are preferably listed. The used amount of the acid substance is, from consideration of the amount of base present in benzylation reaction, from 0.1 to 10 times by mole based on the benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, preferably from 0.5 to 5 times by mole, and further preferably from 1 to 5 times by mole. The treatment temperature using an acid substance is ordinarily from 0 to 100°C, preferably from 10 to 70°C, and further preferably from 20 to 60°C.  Further, without isolating a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative from the reaction liquid containing the benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative obtained by the above-described methods, even by adding the above-described acid substance, the reaction proceeds efficiently, which leads to a process with easy operation and good efficiency. After the resulting benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative is subjected to an acid treatment, it becomes acid salt, and can be purified by being washed with an organic solvent such as toluene, and further, alkalified and extracted with an organic solvent such as- toluene, thereby to isolate a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative.  It is possible to obtain a benzyloxypyrrolidine<br>
 <br>
derivative with high purity by distillation or crystallization<br>

These benzyloxypyrrolidine derivatives can be converted into a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative expressed by the following formula (6) by the following steps: (first step); a hydrochlorination step contacting hydrogen chloride with an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative expressed by general formula (5): [0058] [Chemical formula 15]<br>
 <br>
wherein R3 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen,<br>
ii) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and iv) halogen group; and * in the formula represents an asymmetric carbon:<br>
 <br>
(a second step) an isolation step where a solution obtained by the first step is crystallized, wherein a molar ratio of hydrogen chloride present in a system is adjusted to from 0.9 to 1.2 based on the optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative by conducting a concentration treatment of said solution or not, then, said solution is fed to crystallization. [0060] [Chemical formula 16]<br>
 <br>
wherein R3 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and iv) halogen group; and * in the formula represents an asymmetric carbon. [0062]<br>
Hydrogen chloride used in the first step is preferably hydrogen chloride previously dissolved in an organic solvent (for example, hydrogen chloride dissolved in an organic solvent by contacting hydrogen chloride gas with an organic solvent), and specifically, it can be obtained by blowing hydrogen chloride gas into an organic solvent (in this case, an organic solvent that hydrogen chloride is dissolved is prepared by contacting hydrogen chloride gas with an organic solvent<br>
 <br>
beforehand, which is contacted with an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, leading to contact of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative and hydrogen chloride).  In addition, hydrogen chloride that an aqueous hydrogen chloride solution typified by concentrated hydrochloric acid is contacted with an organic solvent may be used.  In this case, generally, it is necessary to undergo a concentration step, and as a result, there is a tendency that colored powders are obtained.  Therefore, the former method excels in the case where color becomes problems. The concentration of hydrogen chloride in the organic solvent thus obtained can be determined by neutralization titration.  The concentration of hydrogen chloride in an organic solvent is not particularly limited, but generally, it is preferably in a range of from 1 to 20% by weight, more preferably from 1 to 15% by weight, and preferably saturated solubility or lower. [0063]<br>
The organic solvent used in the first step (hereinafter, referred to as hydrochlorination solvent) is not particularly limited, and when it is the same as the organic solvent used in the second step (hereinafter, referred to as crystallization solvent), it is efficient because operations such as solvent substitution can be skipped. On the other hand, when a hydrochlorination solvent is different from a crystallization solvent, generally, solvent substitution can be done by a method<br>
 <br>
such as concentration. [0064]<br>
Further, when the used amount of hydrogen chloride is from 0.9 to 1.2 times by mole based on the benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, no concentration treatment is required in the second step, operation becomes simple and efficient. When less than 0.9, it becomes disadvantageous because the production amount of hydrochloride of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative is lowered, and when more than 1.2, a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative can be obtained if excess hydrogen chloride in hydrochloride formation of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative in the second step is concentrated and removed, [0065]<br>
As specific examples of the hydrochlorination solvent of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, there can be listed ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dioxane, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether and anisole; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol and isobutyl alcohol; and nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile and butyronitrile, ether is preferable, more preferable are tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, diisopropyl ether and cyclopentyl methyl ether, further preferable are<br>
 <br>
aliphatic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and diisopropyl ether.<br>
[0066]<br>
Although the operation method in the first step is not<br>
particularly limited, a specific method will be exemplified.<br>
A most preferable method is a method that an optically active<br>
benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative or an organic solvent solution<br>
thereof is added dropwise to an organic solvent that<br>
hydrochloride is dissolved under from ice cooling to room<br>
temperature* According to this method, speed control of<br>
hydrochlorination is easy and it is advantageous from the point<br>
of temperature control-  Reversely, it is also possible that<br>
an organic solvent that hydrogen chloride is dissolved is added<br>
dropwise to a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative or an organic<br>
solvent solution thereof.  Temperature increases due to heat<br>
of neutralization is observed in either of them, and in the case<br>
of extreme local heat generation or insufficient cooling in<br>
dropping, hydrochlorination solution colors sometimes; thus,<br>
when suppression of coloring is wanted, the temperature control<br>
is important, the temperature is preferably from 0 to 20°C and<br>
more preferably from 0 to 10°C. [0067]<br>
Further, hydrochlorination can be done in such manner<br>
that a concentrated hydrochloric aqueous solution (about 35% by weight) is added dropwise to an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative or an organic solvent solution<br>
 <br>
thereof. After mixing both, hydrochlorination is accelerated by stirring, but generally, it is thought that hydrochlorination is completed just by mixing. After mixing, it is aged till the reaction of hydrochlorination is completed, and the aging temperature is preferably from ice cooling to room<br>
temperature; above all, from 0 to 30°C is more preferable.  The aging time is generally from 10 minutes to 12 hours, and preferably from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  The thus obtained hydrochloride solution is used in the second step without modification. [0068]<br>
The second step aims to isolate the hydrochloride obtained in the first step.  In the present step, the used amount of hydrogen chloride in the hydrochloride solution obtained in the first step needs to be adjusted to from 0.9 to 1.2 times by mole based on the optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative.  For example, when the used amount of hydrogen chloride in the first step is from 0.9 to 1.2 times by mole based on the optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, in the present step, it is possible to carry out crystallization without conducting a concentration treatment, thereby to obtain a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative in good yield.  Additionally, as long as the amount of hydrogen chloride in the hydrochloride solution to be fed to crystallization is in the above-described<br>
 <br>
range, treatments such as concentration and dilution may be conducted, which only increases steps and provides little merit. Further, powders obtained by concentration tend to color. [0069]<br>
On the other hand, when the used amount of hydrogen chloride in the first step is more than 1.2 times by mole based on the optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, after excess hydrogen chloride in hydrochloride formation is removed by the concentration treatment, and the molar ratio is adjusted to from 1.0 to 1,2 (because equimolar hydrogen chloride is used for forming hydrochloride, generally, it does not become less than 1.0 in concentration), crystallization is carried out, thereby a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative can be obtained in good yield. [0070]<br>
However, colored powders are easily obtained; hence, it is preferable to control a molar ratio of hydrogen chloride to an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative in the above-described range without undergoing a concentration step. Further, by controlling the molar ratio in from 0.9 to 1.2 times by mole, a powder having further smaller water absorption can be obtained in high yield.  It is preferable that the concentration treatment is done under reduced pressure just capable of distilling a solvent away and in a condition of as low temperature as possible from the points of prevention of<br>
 <br>
color due to thermal history and prevention of impurities, [0071]<br>
The content of hydrogen chloride can be determined by carrying out a silver nitrate-titration analysis of the liquid subjected to a concentration treatment, and separately, the molar ratio can be calculated by carrying out a quantitative analysis of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative. This quantitative analysis can also be applied to a solution not subjected to the concentration treatment.  In any way, adjustment of the molar ratio is very important, and when the molar ratio of the used amount of hydrogen chloride in a system of a solution to be fed to crystallization is more than 1.2, it is thought that hydrochloride tends to be a supersaturated state due to excess hydrogen chloride, and precipitation of powder is extremely disturbed. [0072]<br>
The crystallization solvent used in the second step may use various ones, and as the specific examples, there can be listed hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, n-hexane and n-heptane; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,3-dioxane, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether and anisole; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutyl alcohol; and nitriles such as acetonitrile,<br>
 <br>
propionitrile and butyronitrile.  Preferable is at least one kind of solvent selected from hydrocarbons and ethers, and more preferable is at least one kind of solvent selected from hydrocarbons such as an aromatic hydrocarbon and aliphatic ethers, and a mixed solvent thereof is preferably used.  For example, a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran and toluene is particularly preferably mentioned from the point of remarkable effects of the present invention, the composition ratio depends on the kind of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, and generally, the content of tetrahydrofuran is preferably in a range of from 1 to 99% by weight, more preferably in a range of from 5 to 95% by weight, and further preferably in a range of from 10 to 90% by weight. The larger the content of tetrahydrofuran is, the better quality the product has. Namely, an aromatic hydrocarbon is a poor solvent for an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative and an aliphatic ether is a good solvent for an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, and thus, a mixed solvent of both is effective to obtain a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative in good quality. [0073]<br>
As described above, as the specific example of a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative expressed by the general<br>
 <br>
formula (6) obtained by contacting an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative with hydrogen chloride in an organic solvent: [0074]<br>
 <br>
(wherein R3 represents a group selected from i) hydrogen, ii) alkyl group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4, iii) alkoxy group having carbon numbers of from 1 to 4 and iv) halogen group; and * in the formula represents an asymmetric carbon.), there can be listed 3(S)-benzyloxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3(R)-benzyloxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3(S)-o-methylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3(R)-o-methylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3(S)-m-methylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3(R)-m-methylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3 (S)-p-methylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3(R)-p-methylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3 (S)-p-ethylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3 (S)-p-isopropylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3 (R)-p-n-butylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride, 3(R)-p-tert-butylphenylmethoxypyrrolidine hydrochloride,<br>

like, and preferably, an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine<br>
hydrochloride expressed by the general formula (7):<br>
[0076]<br>
[Chemical formula 18]<br>
 <br>
Specifically, 3(S)-benzyloxypyrrolidine hydrochloride and 3(R)-benzyloxypyrrolidine hydrochloride [0078]<br>
Regarding the method of crystallization, when to a solution that a molar ratio of hydrogen chloride and an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative is adjusted to from 0.9 to 1.2, a seed crystal is added and aged, it is possible to crystallize nicely without scaling.  In this case,<br>
 <br>
a solution before crystallization may be a homogeneous solution, or may be separated into two liquid-liquid phases. However, in the case where crystals have already precipitated before adding a seed crystal, addition of seed crystal is not required. The temperature of crystallization which is carried out is generally from -20 to room temperature, preferably from -5 to 20°C, and more preferably from ice cooling to 10°C.  Further, to isolate the precipitated hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, it can be done by ordinary methods such as filtration and centrifugal separation. The powder shows deliquescence or high hygroscopic property, so that the operations are all conducted generally under an inert gas atmosphere. [0079]<br>
Further, regarding hydrochloride of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, water is generally used in its synthesis process, and water is generally contained in a solution to be fed for crystallization.  In precipitating hydrochloride in the second step, it has been found that moisture content in the system influences a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative on yield, operability and quality (appearance, moisture absorption property, purity). Namely, it is preferable that moisture content in a system is 0.1 times by mole or less based on the optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative.<br>
 <br>
Quality and appearance of the resulting hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative are greatly influenced by water in a system in the crystallization step, and thus, it is particularly preferable that moisture content is 0.05 times by mole or less based on the optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative*  In the present invention, containing no water is most preferable.  Therefore, the lower limit of the preferable moisture content is 0 times by mole.  In the present invention, by setting moisture content in the above-described range, it is possible to obtain a powder with high purity and good yield. [0080]<br>
In the present invention, when water is excessively present in a system, it is difficult for hydrochloride of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative to become powder, and, even when ground into powder, it has viscosity and tends to form a block; therefore, it becomes difficult to take out crystal due to blocking after filtration and drying, and product purity is lowered due to lots of impurities because the crystal contains much of mother liquid. [0081]<br>
The precipitated hydrochloride of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative can be recovered by a method such as filtration, washed with a suitable solvent and dried to separate it as powder.  As a method for drying the obtained<br>
 <br>
hydrochloride powder of an optically active<br>
benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative, drying in vacuum may be done, but drying under reduced pressure in a stream of inert gas such as nitrogen is common. The hydrochloride of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative obtained as described above is generally of a powder form, and the optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative produced in a preferable mode can be obtained as a powder with low water absorption in such manner that its water absorption is 0.5% by weight or less when standing still at a relative humidity of 25% and a temperature<br>
of 25°C for 20 hours; when it is produced in more preferable mode, there can be obtained one with 0.3% by weight or less; when it is produced in further preferable mode, there can be obtained one with 0.2% by weight or less. The measurement of water absorption is carried out in the following method. [0082]<br>
Since a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative is generally deliquescent, it is dewatered once in vacuum drying before a water absorption experiment.  Generally, pretreatment of a sample for a water absorption experiment is carried out in such manner that a<br>
sample of about 1 g is dried at 20±10 Torr, 45±5°C for 5 hours, and the sample weight is precisely weighed before and after water absorption treatment. The water absorption of hydrochloride powder of an optically active<br>
 <br>
benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative can be calculated by the following formula,<br>
Water absorption (%) = {(sample weight after water<br>
absorption treatment - sample weight before water absorption treatment) / (sample weight before water absorption treatment) }<br>
x 100 (wt%) [0083]<br>
The water absorption experiment can be carried out by using a commercially available constant temperature constant humidity apparatus.  Inside of a container used in the water absorption experiment may be monitored full-time by a thermohygrometer.  Relative humidity 25% and temperature 25°C in the present invention represent 25± 1% and 25±1°C, respectively. [0084]<br>
By the methods described above, a hydrochloride powder of an optically active benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative with high purity can be obtained in high yield and good repeatability. [0085]<br>
The hydrochloride of a benzyloxypyrrolidine derivative thus obtained can be handled even in the case of production in an industrial scale.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>

Hereinafter, the present invention will be described further in detail with reference to Examples, but the present invention is not limited thereto. [0087]<br>

To this solution, 171.4 g (0.79 moles) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate was added dropwise while<br>
maintaining the liquid temperature at 20°C or less. After completion of dropping, the resulting mixture was aged for 1 hour, concentrated, and about 200 g was distilled away.  To this concentrated liquid, 250 g of n-heptane was added and stirred,<br>

Next, 48% sodium hydroxide of 162.0 g (1.94 moles) (3.0 equivalent amount to R-BocHP) was added, and while stirring, benzyl chloride of 106.6 g (0.84 moles) (1.3 equivalent amount to R-BocHP) was added dropwise for the inner<br>
temperature to be from 30 to 40°C in a water bath. After aging of 7 hours, the reaction liquid was quantitatively analyzed using the above-described HPLC analysis method, as a result, the production amount of R-BocBHP was 171 g (reaction yield: 95%) . [0095]<br>
Next, while maintaining the inner temperature at a<br>
temperature in the range from 45 to 55°C, 283.4 g (2.72 moles)<br>

 <br>
as a result, the production amount of R-3BHP was 106.2 g (de-Boc yield: 97%) . After this reaction liquid was washed with toluene, it was alkalized with 48% sodium hydroxide, and extracted with toluene. The mixture was concentrated, then distilled under<br>
reduced pressure to obtain 95.9 g of a fraction of 120°C (0.93<br>
kPa) (recovery rate: 90%).<br>
