Ink-Jet Ink and Recording Material<br>
The present invention relates to an ink jet ink, an Inkjet recording material or an ink jet system with improved properties.<br>
In the ink jet process, an image is produced by ejecting ink droplets onto a recording material through a nozzle. The ink is in most cases an aqueous solution of a dye. The recording material should rapidly and permanently fix the said dye. Specially prepared papers or plastic films provided with a dye-binding layer are mostly used for this purpose. Owing to the fineness of the nozzles, dyes which are completely dissolved in the ink vehicle are preferred to pigments. Besides, dyes offer a higher chroma and a better color gamut when compared to pigments. However, ink jet dyes usually have a poorer fastness to light than, for example, the colored pigments customary in conventional printing inks. As a result, images produced by ink jet printing usually have a limited lifetime when subjected to light and thus rapidly begin to fade or discolor.<br>
The use of water insoluble hindered amine compounds in ink jet ink or media has been reported in e.g. JP2000062310, JP05239389 and JP11348418.<br>
JP2000044851 teaches an ink composition that contains certain hindered amine compounds.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,997 describes an ink jet system that comprises certain amine compounds.<br>
JP99170686 teaches hindered amine type additives generically in the ink receiving layer of ink jet recording media.<br>
U.S. app. No. 20020050226 discloses aqueous ink compositions comprising hindered amine derivatives.<br>
WO02/055618 teaches ink jet inks or ink jet recording materials that comprise hydroxylamine salt compounds.<br>
Sterically hindered N-hydroxylamine salts are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,254,724.<br>
Dialkyl N-hydroxylamine salts are disclosed in U.S. app. No. 09/177,016, filed Oct. 22,1998.<br>
It has now been found that certain sterically hindered N-hydroxylamine salts and certain dialkyl N-hydroxylamine salts provide ink jet prints with outstanding permanence.<br><br>
The N-hydroxylamine salts provide outstanding light stability, gas fade stability and dark storage stability.<br>
Gas fade stability refers to stability against exposure to ozone, singlet oxygen and other airborne pollutants such as NOX, SOX, etc.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to an ink jet ink or ink jet recording material comprising at least one sterically hindered N-hydroxylamine strong acid salt of the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
d and G2   are independently alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or are together pentamethylene;<br>
Z1 and Z2   are each methyl, or<br>
Z1 and Z2 together form an unsubstituted linking moiety or a linking moiety substituted by one or more groups selected from an ester, ether, hydroxy, oxo, cyanohydrin, amide, amino, carboxy or an urethane group,<br>
X	is an anion of a strong acid, wherein the total charge of cations h is equal to the<br>
total charge of anions j, and wherein the strong acid has a pKa 
or comprising at least one dialkyl N-hydroxylamine salt of the formula<br>
(R51R52N-OH) â€¢ (HY), where<br>
R51	is alkyl of 1 to 36 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 5 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl of<br>
7 to 9 carbon atoms; or<br><br>
R52	is hydrogen or independently has the same meaning as R51, where at least one<br>
of R51 and R52 contains a hydrogen alpha to the -NOH moiety; or R51 and R52 together form a C2-12heterocyclic ring which contains at least one carbon<br>
substituted hydrogen alpha to the -NOH moiety, where said C2.12heterocyclic<br>
	ring is unsubstituted or is substituted by one to three three alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon<br><br><br>
E41 and E42 independently are hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms substituted by one to three hydroxy! groups; or E41 and E42 independently are an oligomer of poly(ethylene glycol) or polypropylene glycol) terminated by hydroxyl, methoxy, acetate or propionate, where the oligomer has a molecular weight up to about 500; and<br>
HY	is an inorganic or organic acid.<br>
Strong acids according to this invention are those with a pKa 
Preferably, Y is phosphate, phosphonate, carbonate, bicarbonate, nitrate, chloride, bromide, bisulfite, sulfite, bisulfate, sulfate, borate, formate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, oxalate, tartrate, acrylate, polyacrylate, fumarate, maleate, itaconate, glycolate, gluconate, malate, mandelate, tiglate, ascorbate, polymethacrylate, a carboxylate of nitrilotriacetic acid, hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or of diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid, a diethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or of diethyienetriaminepenta-acetic acid, an alkylsulfonate or an arylsulfonate.<br>
	For example, Y is chloride, bisulfate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, ascorbate, formate,<br>
acetate, benzoate, oxalate, citrate, a carboxylate of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid or polyacrylate, for instance Y is chloride, bisulfate or<br>
citrate.<br>
The values h and j are for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.<br>
For example, Z1 and Z2 together are a hydrocarbon linking moiety containing 1-200, especially 1-60 carbon atoms and 0-60, especially 0-30 heteroatoms selected from oxygen atoms and nitrogen atoms.<br><br>
For instance, Z1 and Z2 as a linking moiety are a chain of 2 or 3 carbon atoms or 1 or 2 carbon atoms and a nitrogen or oxygen atom forming together with the remaining structure a saturated unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring or a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring substituted by one or more groups selected from an ester, ether, hydroxy, oxo, cyanohydrin, amide, amino, carboxy or an urethane group. The substituents in Z1 and Z2 themselves may contain hindered amine moieties.<br>
For the purposes of this invention, the terms "Inkjet recording material" is synonymous with "ink jet recording media" and refers to the entire composition which receives the ink jet ink, or likewise also refers to any individual layers or combinations of individual layers of the entire recording material composition.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to an ink jet system, comprising a recording material and at least one colored ink to be applied to the recording material by means of an ink jet nozzle, characterized in that at least either the recording material or at least one colored ink comprises at least one hydroxylamine salt compound as defined above.<br>

Solvent based inks contain dyes soluble therein, for example Solvent Red, Solvent Yellow, Solvent Orange, Solvent Blue, Solvent Green, Solvent Violet, Solvent Brown or Solvent Black.<br>
The ink compositions according to the novel ink jet system may also contain minor amounts of conventional modifiers such as binders, surfactants, biocides, corrosion inhibitors, sequestrants, pH buffers or conductivity additives. They may also contain further<br><br>
light stabilizers or UV absorbers, including the compounds disclosed in US 5,073,448, US 5,089,050, US 5,096,489, US 5,124,723, US 5,098,477 and US 5,509,957.<br>

Ink compositions that consist of an aqueous phase in which the dye is dissolved and a dispersed oil phase that contains an UV absorber and/or an antioxidant are for example disclosed in JP-A-0 1170 675, JP-A-0 1182 379, JP-A-0 1182 380, JP-A-01182 381, JP-A-0 1193 376. Oil soluble dyes can be dissolved in an oil together with UV absorbers and/or antioxidants. The oil is either emulsified or dispersed in an aqueous phase as described, inter alia, in JP-A-0 1170 674 and JP-A-0 1170 672.<br>

The recording materials according to the novel Inkjet system consist of a substrate having a surface which is printable by means of an ink jet. The substrate is usually plain paper or polyolefine-laminated paper or a plastic sheet and is usually coated with at least one layer which is able to absorb ink. The substrate preferably has a thickness of 80-250jxm.<br>
Uncoated paper might also be used. In this case, the paper acts simultaneously as substrate and ink absorbing layer. Materials made of cellulosic fibres and textile fibres materials such as cotton fabrics or blends of cotton and polyacrylamide or polyester, which might contain the present sterically hindered N-hydroxylamine salts or the dialkyl N-hydroxyl-amine salts, can also be used as printing materials.<br>
The recording materials may also be transparent, as in the case of overhead projection transparencies.<br>
The present sterically hindered N-hydroxylamine salts and the dialkyl N-hydroxylamine salts can be incorporated in the substrate during production thereof, conveniently by addition to the pulp during paper manufacture.

The binders in the individual layers, and in particular gelatines, can also be cross-linked by suitable compounds, so-called hardening agents, in order to improve the water and scratch resistance of the layers. Suitable hardening agents are described in Research Disclosure No, 37254 part IX (1995) page 294, 37038 part XII (1995) page 86 and 38957 part KB (1996) page 599 et seq. The hardening agents are normally used in quantities of<br><br>
0.005 to 10% by weight, and preferably 0.01 to 1% by weight, based on the binder to be hardened.<br>
The ink jet recording material can be produced in one pass from the support material and a casting solution for each layer to be applied, by means of a cascade or curtain casting device of the kind known from the production of photographic silver halide materials. After the casting solution(s) has/have been cast on the support, the material is dried and is then ready for use. The individual layers have a dry layer thickness of 0.1 to 20 Âµm, and preferably 0.5 to 5 Âµm.<br>
Present sterically hindered N-hydroxylamine salts and the dialkyl N-hydroxylamine salts can be dissolved either directly in the ink or coating composition or added thereto in the form of an emulsion or suspension.

Application can be made by spraying, by sizing in a sizing press, by a separate coating operation or by immersion in a vat. After subjecting the recording material to such an after treatment, an additional drying step is necessary.<br>
