Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in- detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
A Blu-ray disc is taken as an example of an optical disc according to the present invention. Yet, the concept of the present invention, characterized in an optical disc having its disc control information recorded thereon, is applicable to DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, and similar such discs. Although the terminology used herein is well known for the most part, some terms have been chosen by the applicant, such that the present invention should be understood with the intended meanings of the terminology as used by the applicant. For example, the "disc control information" of a disc is recorded in a specified area, i.e., a recordable area of the disc  or a prerecorded area (sometimes known as an embossed area, in which manufacturer data is recorded and where no further recording is possible), and includes information necessary for the playback of a recorded disc.  Disc control<br>
information is called "disc information" or "DI" in relation to B]u-ray disc technology but id typically referred to as "physical format information" for DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+Rv-.:, DVD-R, and DVD+R discs. Hence, it should be apparent that the' technical background of the present invention is equally applicable to physical format information.<br>
Moreover,  the  disc  information  according  to  the  present invention is recorded as an unspecified unit of information, which may be counted,  for example,  as a first or second information.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate the structure of optical discs according to the present invention, in which any recordable optical disc may be applicable to the present invention. The recordable disc may be, for example, a rewritable optical disc or a write-once optical disc.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, illustrating an optical disc having one recording layer, a lead-in area is provided as a management area on an inner circumference area of an optical disc, whereas a lead-out area is provided as a management area on an outer circumference area of the optical disc. In the inner circumference area, a pre-recorded area and a rewritable (or<br>
write-once area are provided separately. In 3D-RE and BD-V.O technology, the pre - recorded are- is called the PIC area, where permanent information and control data is recorded, and disc information is recorded in the PIC area. A data area is made up of a user data area where user data is recorded and inner and outer spare areas ISA and OSA, which are used in the replacement of the data of a defective area. In the case of a BD-WO disc, a temporary defect management area (TDMA) is provided for recording information of a defect and for general management. The TDMA is unnecessary in the case of BD-RE discs, which have a corresponding area designated as reserved. The present invention intends to provide a method of recording disc information (DI) as disc control information required for record playback of a disc in a pre-recorded or recordable are. It is apparent that a recording method in the pre-record area is differently applied to each kind of disc. In the case of BD-RE and hD-WO discs, the pre-recorded area is the PIC area recorded using a biphased high-frequency modulated signal reproduced according to a specific playback method, to acquire the disc information.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates an optical disc having dual recording layers, in which an inner circumferance toe of the disc thath lead-in of a first recording layer layer of the midelay a lead-out of a second recording layer (Layer 1) . In this case, one PIC area is provided in. each of the lead-in and lead-out areas, and the same disc information is recorded in each PIC area.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a PIC area formatted according to the present invention. In configuring the disc information of the PIC area of a BD-RE or BD-WO disc, the minimum recording unit is one cluster, 544 clusters constitute one fragment , and five fragments make up the PIC area. Disc information is recorded in a front head cluster of a first fragment IFO. The disc information is plurally recorded per recording layer and recording velocity permitted by the corresponding optical disc. One disc information includes 112 bytes, sometimes referred to as a DI frame. To cope with a loss of disc information, the same contents of the disc information are repeatedly recorded in each front head cluster of the remainder of the fragments. Information representing the corresponding recording layer, information  representing  recording  velocity,   and  write<br>
strategy information corresponding to the recording velocity are included in each disc information. Such information is utilized in records ng and reproducing the opcical disc, to provide an optimal condition per recording layer and per recording velocity.<br>
The disc information of the present invention is characterized in providing specific recording velocity information supported by the disc and associated write strategy information, and more specifically, in providing specific recording velocity supported for each recording layer and associated write strategy information via a specified method for discs having a plurality of recording layers.<br>
The specific configuration of the disc information is for a Blu-ray disc, which may differ from the configuration of a DVD-based disc. Specifically, the recording DI volume for a Blu-ray disc is 112 bytes or equivalent. By formulating the disc information of the same recording layer as one information, i.e., without repeating any common information, the write strategy configuration may differ per recording velocity.<br>
FIGS.  4A-4C  illustrate  the  recording  of -disc  information according  to a  first  of  four eitibodiments  of  the present invention,  in which disc  information  is  configured  in a specific sequence per recording layer and recording velocity. Referring  to  FIG.  4A,  each disc  information  sequence  is determined by a sequence number and is recorded using one byte. For instance,  the information is recorded in a fifth byte (i.e., the "DI frame sequence number in DI block," which can be represented as 00h, Olh, 02h, 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h, or 07h) of the disc information, where a fifth byte of OOh or 07h indicates a first or eighth disc information, respectively. Moreover, recording layer information and recording velocity information,  which will be -used by the corresponding disc<br>
information, are represented by specific bits and recorded in<br>
a specific area (Nth byte) within the disc information.  For<br>
instance, the recording layer information and the recording<br>
velocity information are respectively recorded in the upper<br>
and lower four bits of the Nth byte, where a recording layer<br>
information of 0000b, 1000b, or 1001b ac the upper four bits<br>
indicates a single layer, a dual layer LO (first layer), or a<br>
dual layer LI  (second layer), respectively, and a recording<br>
velocity information cf OCOOb, 0010b, 0100b, 1000b, or 1111b as the lower four bits indicates a ix-speed, 2x-speed, 4x-speed, 8x-speed, or lox-speed recording velocity, respectively. By allocating one byte thusly, the recording layer information and the recording velocity information can be defined according tc a system or specification enactment. The recording layer information and the recording velocity information are recorded in a reserved specific location corresponding to their sequence number, as shown in FIG. 4A, thereby facilitating to confirm the recording layer information and the recording velocity information included in the corresponding disc information. By recording write power or write parameters as write strategy information fitting the corresponding recording layer and recording velocity in detail using the remainder of the bytes within the disc information, namely, the 44th-lllth bytes, the recorded information enables efficient recording and. reproducing of an optical disc. The information recorded in the 44th~lllth bytes is referred to as i-Ho write strategy parameters.<br>
FIG.  4B exemplarily shows disc information recorded in a single layer when representing the disc information shown in<br>
FIG. 4A When an optical disc requires four different recording velocity information, four disc information corresponding to the four recording velocities are needed within a PIC area. In each disc information, its sequence number is recorded in a fifth byte and corresponding recording layer information and recording velocity information are recorded in an Nth byte by allocating four bits, to each of the corresponding recording layer information and the corresponding recording velocity information. For instance, a representation of recording velocities as lx-speed, 2x-speed, 4x-speed, and 8x-speed corresponds to the case of the single layer in FIG. 4B. Hence, the upper four bits of the Nch byte is 0000b to designate the single layer and the lower four bits indicate each recording velocity information.   Specifically,<br>
0000b indicating lx-speed is written in the first disc information, 0010b indicating 2x-speed is written in the second disc information, 0100b indicating 4x-speed is written in the third disc information, and 1000b indicating 8x-speed is written in the fourth disc information<br>
FIG. 4C exemplarily shows disc information recorded in a dual layer when representing the disc information shown in FIG. 4A,<br>
in which each disc information corresponding to recording velocity information per recording layer is cor figured in configuring disc information in case that at lease two recording layers exist. Namely, disc information is mainly configured per recording layer and another disc information according to recording velocity of a corresponding recording layer is then configured. In the aspect of a sequence of configuring disc information, disc information is preferentially configured on a recording layer; another disc information, according to a corresponding recording velocity in the corresponding recording layer, is then configured. Hence, if an optical disc includes two recording layers and each recording layer requires four different recording velocity information, eight disc information are needed to cope with each recording velocity per recording layer within a PIC area. In each of the disc information, a sequence number is written in a fifth byte and recording layer information and recording velocity information are respectively written in four allocated bits of an Nth byte.<br>
For instance, if the recording velocities to be represented per recording layer are lx-speed, 2x-speed, 4x-speed, and 8x-<br>
speed, first through fourth disc information ar° configured with disc information of a first recording layer (layer 0), the upper four bit.3 of th? N1th byte are 1000b to designate the first recording layer, and the lower four bits of the NCr' by^e indicate the respective recording velocity information. Specifically, 0000b indicating lx-speed is written in the first disc information, 0010b indicating 2x-speed is written in the second disc information, 0100b indicating 4x-speed is written in third disc information, and 1000b indicating 8x-speed is written in the fourth disc information.<br>
Moreover, fifth through eighth disc information are configured with disc information of a second recording layer (layer 1) of the dual layer. The upper four bits of the Nch byte are 1001b to designate the second recording layer, and the lower four bits of the N byte indicate the respective recording velocity information. Specifically, 0000b indicating lx-speed is written in the fifth disc information, 0010b indicating 2x-speed is written in the sixth disc information, 0100b indicating 4x-speed is written in the seventh disc information, and 1000b indicating 8x-speed is written in the eighth disc information.<br>
In the first embodiment, disc information is separated for each recording velocity in each layer. • In accordance v;ith another embodiment, disc information is separated for ec-ch recording layer, and each recording velocity per recording layer can be included in one DI. In this case, there is one DI per recording layer and the recorded DI volume varies according to the number of supported recording velocities. FIGS. 5A to 5C illustrate the recording of disc information according to a second of four embodiments of the present invention. In contrast to the first embodiment, the recording layer information and recording velocity information of the second embodiment are recorded in a fifth byte representing a sequence number of disc information.<br>
Instead of simply indicating a sequence of. continuous disc information, a sequence number within disc information indicates that the disc information is recorded in a specific sequence by writing recording layer information and recording velocity information of the present invention in the above area.<br>
FIG. 5B illustrates the second embodiment applied to a single layer,  in which  recording  layer  information and recording<br>
velocity information are recorded in the same manner as the first embodiment (FIG. 4B) but are written in the fifth byte instead of Nth.<br>
For instance, a representation of recording velocities as lx-speed, 2x-speed, 4x-speed, and 8x-speed corresponds to the case of the single layer in FIG. 5B. Hence, the upper four bits of the fifth byte are 0000b designating the single layer, and the lower four bits of the fifth byte indicate each recording velocity information. Specifically, 0000b indicating lx-speed is written in the first disc information, 0010b indicating 2x-speed is written in the second disc information, 0100b indicating 4x-speed is written in the third disc information, and 1000b indicating 8x-speed is written in the fourth disc information.<br>
FIG. 5C illustrates the second embodiment applied to a dual layer, in which recording layer information and recording velocity information are recorded in the same manner as the first embodiment (FIG. 4B) but are written in a fifth byte instead of the Nch. For instance, if the recording velocities to be represented per recording layer are lx-speed, 2x-speed, 4x-speed,  and  8x-speed,  the  first  through  fourth  disc<br>
information are configured with disc information of a first recording layer (layer 0) of the dual layer. Hence, the upper tour bits of the fifth byte are 1000b to designate the first recording layer, and the lower four bits of the fifth byte means indicate each recording velocity information. Specifically, 0000b indicating lx-speed is written in the first disc information, 0010b indicating 2x-speed is written in the second disc information, 0100b indicating 4x-speed is written in the third disc information, and 1000b indicating 8x-speed is written in the fourth disc information. Meanwhile, the fifth through eighth disc information are configured with disc information of a second recording layer (layer 1) of the dual layer. The upper four bits of the fifth byte are 1001b to designate the second recording layer, and the lower four bits of the fifth byte indicate each recording velocity information. Specifically, 0000b indicating lx-speed is written in the fifth disc information, 0010b indicating 2x-speed is written in the sixth disc information, 0100b indicating 4x-speed is written in the seventh disc information, and 1000b indicating 8x-speed is written in the eighth disc information.<br>
FIGS. 6A to 6S illustrate the recording uf disc information according to a third of four embodiments of the present invention.<br>
In the third embodiment, a plurality of disc information are recorded in a disc, a record sequence of each disc information is determined by a sequence number, and the record sequence is recorded in one byte. For instance, the corresponding information is recorded in a fifth byte (i.e., the "DI frame sequence number in DI block," which can be represented as OOh, Olh, 02h, 03h, 04h, 05h, 06h, or 07h) of the disc information. Here, for example, a fifth byte of OOh indicates the first disc information as well as disc information of lx-speed of a first recording layer (Layer 0), a fifth byte of Olh indicates the second disc information as well as disc information of 2x-<br>
speed of the first recording layer, and a fifth byte of 07h indicates the eighth disc information as well as disc information of 8x-speed of a second recording layer (Layer 1). Hence, the disc information is preferentially arranged in a recording layer sequence and is configured to follow a per recording velocity information sequence.<br>
Write strategy, ,interoperating wich recording velocity meant by the corresponding disc information, is recorded ir. a specific area, e.g., a v/rite strategy parameters field (the Lth~lllch bytes), within the disc information. Identification information for identifying the recorded write strategy type is recorded in another specific area, e.g., a write strategy code field (the Nth byte) , within the disc information. If there are N kinds of write strategy (WS), the identification information allocates a specific recognition value to each write strategy, setting, for instance, 0000 0001b to indicate a first write strategy (WS-1), 0000 0010b to indicate a second write strategy (WS-2), and XXXX XXXXb to indicate an Nth write strategy (WS-N) . A WS type of 0000 0000b can be set to indicate that no specific WS type exists as well as WS parameters. Namely, the 'WS code' information of the N byce can be utilized to indicate that there is no WS as well as information designating the WS type.<br>
FIG. 6B shows an example of recording disc information for a specific write strategy, in which a disc manufacturer selects to record WS-1 from various specifications in recording a write strategy for lx-speed within lx-speed disc information<br>
of a firy. recording layer. Namely, a write strategy code field (Nth byce) of 0000 0001b indicates a first write strategy, and parameter values corresponding to WS-1 are written in the write strategy parameters field (the Lth-lllth bytes).<br>
If a disc manufacturer selects to record in WS-2, 0000 0010b is written in the write strategy code field and WS-2 parameters will be written in the Lth-lllth bytes. These write strategy parameters have different values according to the kind of write strategy. The corresponding write strategy parameters are predetermined, as specified information fitting the characteristics of the disc, and made available to a disc manufacturer or a system designer. As such, the write strategy parameters have arbitrary values with no relevance to the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 6C to 6E show specific embodiments for including the write strategy in the disc information of the present invention, assuming a dual-layer disc in which lx-speed and 2x-speed are applied to the two recording layers, respectively. Here, FIGS. 6C and 6D show a write strategy optionally selected to be recorded for all recording layers and recording<br>
vejocitier. on manufacturing a disc, and FIG. 6E shows a recorded write strategy predetermined based on a mandatory recording at a specific recording velocity.<br>
FIG. 6C shows a case of optionally recording the write strategy for all recording layers and recording velocities. For instance, OOh is recorded to indicate disc information of lx-speed for a first recording layer, and WS-1 is selected as the write strategy; Olh is recorded to indicate disc information of 2x-speed for the first recording layer, and WS-2 is selected as the write strategy; 02h is recorded to indicate" disc information of lx-speed for a second recording layer, and WS-1 is selected as the write strategy; and 03h is recorded to indicate disc information of 2x1speed for the second recording layer, and WS-N is selected as the write strategy.<br>
FIG. 6D shows another example of optionally recording the write strategy, in which the same write strategy is applied to the disc information of every recording layer and recording, velocity. Since write stracegy can t&gt;e optionally recorded, a disc manufacturer may apply the entire disc information identically for one most reliable write strategy.   FIG.  6D<br>
illustrates  a  case  that  WS-1  is  written  for  every  disc information. '<br>
FIG. 6E shows a method of recording a write strategy previously determined in a mandatory manner in case of a specific recording velocity and write strategies optionally for all other recording velocities. The write strategy for lx-speed is considered primary, where a specific method is predetermined, and a disc manufacturer can optionally record all other recording velocities. For instance, if the write strategy mandatory for the lx-speed is WS-1, OOh is recorded to indicate disc information of lx-speed for a first recording layer, and WS-1 is set as the mandatory write strategy. Then, Olh is recorded to indicate disc information of 2x-speed for the first recording layer, and WS-2 is selected as the write strategy that can be optionally recorded; 02h is recorded to indicate dire information of lx-speed for a second recording layer, and WS-1 is selected as the mandatory write strategy; and 03h is recorded to indicate disc information of 2x-speed ror the second recording layer, WS-2 is selected as the write strategy that can be optionally recorded.<br>
In applying the case of FIG. 6E, one of a plurality of specified write strategies is uniformly written as the lx-speed write strategy in a mandatory manner, thereby enabling to secure recording characteristics of the disc more A disc manufacturer can optionally record one of a plurality of the specified write strategies uniformly for all recording velocities besides the lx-speed, whereby a disc manufacturing process time can be shortened. Here, the mandatory write strategy for lx-speed can be recorded and a disc manufacturer can optionally record another write strategy for lx-speed separately, in which case the disc information for lx-speed is made up of one disc information including the . specified mandatory  write  strategy  and  another  disc  information<br>
including the optional write strategy.<br>
I FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate the recording of disc information<br>
according to a fourth of  four embodiments of the present<br>
invention.  First of all, a plurality.of disc information are<br>
recorded in a disc, a record sequence of each disc information<br>
is determined by a sequence number, and the record sequence is<br>
written  in  one  byte.    For  instance,  the  corresponding<br>
information is recorded in a fifth byte (i.e., the "DI frame<br>
sequence number in DI block, " v.'hich can be represented as OOh, Olh, 02h, 03h, 04h, 05h; 06h, or 07h} of the disc information, where a fifth byte of OOh, Olh, or 07h indicates a first disc information of 2x-speed for * first, recording layer, a second disc information of 2x-speed for the first recording layer, or an eighth disc information of 8x-speed for a second recording layer, respectively. Hence, the disc information is preferentially arranged in a recording layer sequence and is configured to follow a per recording velocity information sequence.<br>
In a specific area within the disc information, recording velocity information designated by the corresponding disc information and write strategy coping with the corresponding recording velocity are written in a reserved specific location. For instance, the recording velocity information of the corresponding disc information is written in the Nth-(N+4)th bytes, and the write strategy coping with the corresponding recording velocity is written in the Mth~lllth bytes. For the fourth embodiment of the present invention to provide disc information coping with high recording velocity, the recording velocity information and write strategy are written<br>
for each of a plurality of recording velocity information, i.e., a nominal recording velocity (Vnora), a maximum recordina velocity (Vmax) , a minimum recording velocity (Vmir&gt;) , and an intermediate recording velocity (Vint). Here-, the nominal recording velocity is a basic recording velocity of a corresponding disc and is generally written as information associated with lx-speed; the maximum recording velocity is an applicable maximum recording velocity (e.g., 3x-speed) associated with the optimal recording velocity; the minimum recording velocity ins an applicable minimum recording velocity (e.g., Vmax/2.4) associated with the optimal recording velocity; and the intermediate recording velocity is an applicable intermediate recording velocity (e.g., 1.7xVmin) associated with the optimal recording velocity. The above relation of recording velocity values has been determined by considering a radius ratio between inner and outer circumferences of a Blu-ray disc applicable to the present invention. It is apparent that such a relation can be variably applied to other kinds of discs and that the recording velocity values can be set to different values according to disc characteristics.<br>
Relating to the optimal recording velocity (lx-speed], the same information is preferably recorded in each disc information. Preferably, the maxir.um, minimum, and intermediate recording velocities are differently determined according to the maximum recording velocity value as far as the corresponding information is applicable.<br>
Though any number of intermediate recording velocities can be established, the present invention is characterized in having at least one intermediate recording velocity. At least four recording velocity information are included in one disc information, with system operation benefiting from larger numbers of recording velocity information. By utilizing a recordable area within disc information to the maximum, many intermediate recording velocity information can be provided. FIG. 7B schematically shows disc information recorded in the case of FIG. 7A, and more particularly, in the case of a dual layer. For instance, when an optical disc requires three different recording velocity information per recording layer, six disc information corresponding to the respective recording velocities are needed within a PIC area. Each disc information  is  allocated  to  write  a  sequence  number,<br>
corresconding recording velocity information, and corresponding write strategy to a predetermined area. For instance, if r.be recording velocities tc be represented are lx-speed, 2x-speed, and 6x-speed. the disc information for a first recording Xayer includes first, second, and third disc information. Here, the first disc information is lx-speed disc information of the first recording layer, its sequence number corresponding to OOh, and the corresponding recording velocity and write strategy are written in a reserved location, i.e., the Nch-(N+4)th bytes and the Mth-lllch bytes, respectively; the second disc information is 2x-speed disc information of the first recording layer, its sequence number corresponding to Olh, and the corresponding recording velocity and write strategy are written in similarly reserved locations; and the third disc information is 6x-speed disc information of the first recording layer, its sequence number corresponding to 02h, and the corresponding recording velocity and write strategy are written in similarly reserved locations. Likewise, fourth, fifth, and sixth disc information are for a second recording layer, where the fourth disc information is lx-speed disc information of the second recording layer and<br>
its sequence number corresponds to 03h, where the fifth disc information is 2x-speed disc information of the second recording layer and its sequence number corresponds to 04h, and where the sixth disc information is 6x-speed disc information of the second recording layer and its sequence number corresponds to 05h. In this case, corresponding recording velocity and write strategy are written in the same location as in the case of the first recording layer. In the fourth embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of recording velocity information are all included in one disc, information, but one write strategy associated with specific recording velocity information can be written in one disc information with the remainder written in another disc information.  For instance, regarding four kinds of recording<br>
velocity information, the number of required disc information will be four times more than that of the above-explained embodimenL. Yet, the PIC area, in which the disc information of 112 bytes is written, is an area providing for a sufficiently large number of disc information to be written information.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates an optical disc recording and reproducing apparatus using disc control information according to the present invention. The recording and reproducing apparatus comprises a recorder/reproducer 10 for recording data on and reproducing data from an optical disc and a controller 20 for controlling the recorder/reproducer 10. The controller 20 generates a record or playback command for a specific area, and the recorder/reproducer 10 caries out the record/playback function for the specific area accordingly. The recorder/reproducer 10 includes an interface 12 for communicating with an external device, i.e., the controller (or host) ,• a pickup 11 for performing read and write operations with respect to the optical disc; a data processor 13 for modulating the pickup's input signal for performing a reproduction operation and for demodulating the pickup's output signal for performing a record operation; a servo 14 for controlling the read and write operations of the pickup; a memory 15 for temporarily storing disc control information; and a microcomputer 16 for respectively controlling each element of the recorder/reproducer.<br>
In e. recording data on an optical disc according to the present invention, the optical disc recording and reproducing apparatus rirst reads the entire disc management area of an inserted optical disc, the read information being disc information of the present invention, which is temporarily stored in the memory 15. Thus, the recording layer information, recording velocity information, and write strategy fitting the corresponding recording velocity are read out and temporarily stored.<br>
If intending to perform a writing on a specific area within the optical disc, the controller 20 renders such an intent into a writing command and then delivers it to the recorder/reproducer 10 together with data for writing location information to be recorded. After receiving the writing command, the microcomputer 16 decides the corresponding recording velocity applied to an intended recording layer within the optical disc from the management information stored in the memory 15 and then performs the writing command using the most optimal write strategy by referring to the decided recording velocity.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides methods of formatting disc control information for coping wich higher recording velocities in a high-density optical disc, enabling standardized disc control information to be used when recording and reproducing.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
