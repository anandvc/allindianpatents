DESCRIPTION POLYLACTIC ACID COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition containing polylactic acid. More specifically, it relates to a composition which contains polylactic acid, has excellent heat stability, mechanical strength and color, and can be stored for a long time.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Since most plastics are light in weight, tough and durable and can be molded easily and arbitrarily, they are mass-produced to support our lives in many ways. However, when plastics are thrown away into the environment, they are not easily decomposed and are accumulated. Vlihen they are burnt, they emit a large amount of carbon dioxide, thereby accelerating global warming.<br>
In view of this situation, researches into resins made from non-oil raw materials or biodegradable plastics which are degraded by microorganisms are now actively under way. The biodegradable plastics have an aliphatic carboxylate unit and are easily degraded by microorganisms. However, they have low heat stability and a serious problem such as a reduction in their molecular weights or the deterioration of their colors in the step where they are exposed to a high temperature, such as melt spinning, injection molding or melt film formation.<br>
Although polylactic acid, out of the degradable plastics, is a plastic which has excellent heat resistance and good balance between color and mechanical strength, when it is compared with petroleum-based resins typified by polyethylene terephthalate and polyamide, there is still a world of difference in heat stability between it and the<br><br>
petroleum-based resins. To overcome this situation, various studies have been made on the improvement of the heat stability of polylactic acid.  For example, Patent Document 1 proposes that a phosphoric acid-based compound or phosphorous acid-based compound is added to polylactic acid as a catalyst deactivator when the molecular weight reaches 50, 000 or more.  Patent Documents 2 and 3 teach that an acidic phosphate or chelating agent is added as a catalyst deactivator to improve the heat stability of polylactic acid. However, the addition of the catalyst deactivator to the low-molecular weight polylactic acid as in Patent Document 1 impedes a subsequent polymerization reaction, thereby making it impossible to obtain a high-molecular weight polymer. Meanwhile, the acidic phosphate disclosed by Patent Documents 2 and 3 causes the corrosion of production equipment or the deterioration of the hydrolytic resistance of the resin due to its acidity.  The chelating agent enumerated above generally has low heat resistance and burns before a metal catalyst is supplied, thereby causing serious coloration and bad smell.<br>
As described above, a polylactic acid composition which suppresses both opening polymerization caused by the residual polymerization catalyst and a reduction in molecular weight by the disconnection of the main chain and has excellent heat stability is not proposed yet. (Patent Document 1) Japanese Patent No. 2862071 (Patent Document 2) Japanese Patent No. 3487388 (Patent Document 3) JP-A 10-36651<br>
DISCLOStFRE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition which contains polylactic acid and has excellent heat stability and color.  It is another object of the present invention to provide a composition which has<br><br>
a high content of a stereocomplex crystal and excellent heat resistance.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that, when a phosphono-fatty acid ester is contained in polylactic acid, the residual catalyst contained in the polylactic acid can be deactivated effectively, thereby making it possible to improve the heat stability and color of the polylactic acid. The present invention has been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
That is, according to the present invention, there is provided a composition which contains 0.001 to 0.1 part by weight of a metal catalyst and 0.001 to 0.5 part by weight of a phosphono-fatty acid ester based on 10 0 parts by weight of polylactic acid. According to the present invention, there is provided a molded product of the composition. Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a process of manufacturing a composition which contains a stereocomplex crystal by mixing together poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid, wherein at least one of poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid contains a metal catalyst and the mixing is carried out in the presence of 0 . 001 to 0 .5 part by weight of a phosphono-fatty acid ester based on 100 parts by weight of the total of poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OTTT THE IHVENTI01&gt;!<br><composition><br>
(polylactic acid)<br>
Polylactic acid is a polymer essentially composed of a lactic acid unit represented by the following formula. The polylactic acid is preferably poly-L-lactic acid, poly-D-lactic acid or a mixture thereof. The poly-L-lactic acid is a polymer which contains an L-lactic acid unit as the main component and the poly-D-lactic acid is a polymer<br><br>
which contains a D-lactic acid, unit as the main component<br><br>
The poly-L~Iactic acid contains preferably 90 to 100 mol%, more preferably 95 to 100 mol%, much more preferably 98 to 100 mol% of an L-lactic acid unit. Other units include a D-lactic acid unit and units other than lactic acid. The total amount of the D-lactic acid unit and units other than lactic acid is preferably 0 to 10 mol%, more preferably 0 to 5 mDl%, much more preferably 0 to 2 mol%.<br>
The poly-D-lactic acid contains preferably 90 to 100 mol%, more preferably 95 to 100 mol%, much more preferably 98 to 100 mol% of a D-lactic acid unit. Other units include an L-lactic acid unit and units other than lactic acid. The total amount of the L-lactic acid unit and units other than lactic acid is preferably 0 to 10 mol%, more preferably 0 to 5 mol%, much more preferably 0 to 2 mol%.<br>
The units other than lactic acid include units derived from dicarboxylic acids, polyhydric alcohols, hydroxycarboxyiic acids and lactones having a functional group capable of forming at least two ester bonds and units derived from polyesters, polyethers and polycarbonates comprising these as constituent components.<br>
The dicarboxylic acids include succinic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid. The polyhydric alcohols include aliphatic polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, octanediol, glycerin, sorbitan, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol, and aromatic polyhydric alcohols<br><br>
such as an adduct of bisphenol with ethylene oxide. The hydroxycarboxylic acids include glycolic acid and hydroxybutyric acid. The lactones include glycollide,     i E-caprolactone glycollide, s-caprolactone, p-propiolactone, 6-butyrolactone, p- or y-butyrolactone, pivalolactone and 6-valerolactone.<br>
The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the poly-L-lactic acid or poly-D-lactic acid is preferably 50,000 to 500,000, more preferably 150,000 to 350,000.  The weight average molecular weight is a value in terms of standard polystyrene measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using chloroform as an eluent-<br>
The poly-L-lactic acid and the poly-D-lactic acid can be manufactured by known methods.  For example, they can be manufactured by heating L-lactide and D-lactide in the presence of a metal catalyst for ring opening polymerization, respectively. Alternatively, they can be manufactured by heating low-molecular weight polylactic acid which contains a metal catalyst under a reduced pressure or in an inert gas stream for solid-phase polymerization after they are crystallized.  Further, they can be manufactured by direct polymerization in which lactic acid is dehydrated and condensed in the presence or absence of an organic solvent.<br>
The polymerization reaction can be carried out in a conventionally known reactor, for example, vertical reactors equipped with a high viscosity stirring blade such as helical ribbon blade, which may be used alone or in combination. An alcohol may be used as a polymerization initiator. The alcohol preferably does not impede the polymerization of polylactic acid and is nonvolatile, as exemplified by decanol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, hexadecanol, octadecanol, ethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and benzyl alcohol.<br>
In the solid-phase polymerization method, a relatively low-molecular weight lactic acid polyester obtained by the<br><br>
above ring-opening polymerization or the direct polymerization of lactic acid is used as a prepolymer.  It is preferred from the viewpoint of preventing fusion that the prepolymer should be crystallized at a temperature of its glass transition temperature (Tg) or higher and lower than its melting point (Tm) in advance. The crystallized prepolymer is charged into a fixed vertical reactor or a rotary reactor such as tumbler or kiln and heated at the glass transition temperature (Tg) or higher and lower than the melting point (Tm) . There will be no problem if the polymerization temperature is raised stepwise along with the proceeding of polymerization.  It is also preferred that the inside of the reactor should be reduced or the heated inert gas stream should be circulated in order to remove water generated during solid-phase polymerization effectively.<br>
The polylactic acid preferably contains a stereocomplex crystal. This polylactic acid containing a stereocomplex crystal is called "stereocomplex polylactic acid". This stereocomplex polylactic acid has a high melting point and excellent heat resistance. The stereocomplex crystal is formed by mixing together poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid. In this case, the weight ratio of the poly-L-lactic acid to the poly-D-lactic acid is preferably 90/10 to 10/90, more preferably 75/25 to 25/75, much more preferably 60/40 to 40/60.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the stereocomplex polylactic acid is preferably 100,000 to 500,000, more preferably 100,000 to 300,000. The weight average molecular weight is a value in terms of standard polystyrene measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using chloroform as an eluent.<br>
The content of the stereocomplex crystal is preferably 80 to 100 %, more preferably 95 to 100 %. In the stereocomplex polylactic acid in the present invention, the proportion of<br><br>
melting peaks at IBB'^C or higher to melting peaks in the temperature elevation process measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) is preferably 80 % or more, more preferably 90 % or more, much more preferably 95 % or more. The melting point is preferably 195 to 250°C, more preferably 200 to 220°C. The enthalpy of melting is preferably 20 J/g or more, more preferably 30 J/g or more. More specifically, it is preferred that the proportion of melting peaks at 195°C or higher to melting peaks in the temperature elevation process measured by the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) be 90 % or more, the melting point be 195 to 250°C, and the enthalpy of melting be 2 0 J/g or more.<br>
The stereocomplex polylactic acid can be manufactured by mixing together poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid in a predetermined weight ratio. The mixing can be carried out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent is not particularly limited if it can dissolve poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid. Preferred examples of the solvent include chloroform, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, phenol, tetrahydrofuran, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylformamide, butyrolactone, trioxane and hexafluoroisopropanol which are used alone or in combination of two or more. The mixing' may be carried out in the absence of a solvent. That is, poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid are melt kneaded together. Stated more specifically, a method in which predetermined amounts of poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid are mixed together and then melt kneaded together, or a method in which any one of them is molten and then the other is added to and kneaded with the molten one may be employed.<br>
(metal catalyst)<br>
The metal catalyst is preferably a compound which contains at least one metal selected from the group<br><br>
consisting of alkali earth metals, rare earth, nietals, third row transition metals, alumiuura, germanium, tin and antimony. The alkali earth metals include magnesium, calcium and strontium. The rare earth metals include scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and cerium. The third row transition metals include iron, cobalt, nickel and zinc.<br>
The metal catalyst can be added to the polylactic acid as a carboxylate, alkoxide or aryloxide of one of these metals,<br>
or enolate of p-diketone. When polymerization activity and color are taken into consideration, tin octylate, titanium tetraisoprepoxide and aluminum triisopropoxide are particularly preferred.<br>
The content of the metal catalyst is 0.001 to 0 .1 part by weight, preferably 0 .005 to o. 05 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polylactic acid. When the content of the metal catalyst is too low, the polymerization rate greatly drops disadvantageously. When the content is too high, coloring occurs by reaction heat, or opening polymerization or ester interchange reaction is accelerated, whereby the color and heat stability of the obtained composition become worse.<br>
The content of the metal catalyst is 2 x 10'* to 0.05 part by weight, preferably 1 x 10'^ to 0.03 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polylactic acid as a metal element. The amount of the metal element can be determined by TCP emission analysis.<br>
(phosphono-fatty acid ester)<br>
The phosphono-fatty acid ester used in the present invention is a compound in which a diester phosphonate moiety and a carboxylate moiety are bonded together by an aliphatic hydrocarbon group. Since this phosphono-fatty acid ester is achromatic and transparent and has excellent heat resistance, the obtained composition has a good color.<br><br>
Particularly, a phosphono- fatty acid ester having a chemical<br>
structure of the following formula (1) provides a good result<br>
to the object of the present invention.<br>
t<br><br>
In the above formula, Ri, R2 and R3 are each independently an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or aryl group having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, Examples of the alkyl group include ethyl group, propyl group, butyl group, pentyl group, hexyl group, decyl group and octadecyl group. Examples of the aryl group include phenyl group and naphthalene-yl group. The aryl group may be substituted by a halogen atom or alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of the substituent halogen atom include fluorine atom, chlorine atom and bromine atom. Examples of the substituent alkyl group include ethyl group, propyl group, butyl group, pentyl group and hexyl group. Ri to R3 may be the same or different, n is an integer of 1 to 3.<br>
Examples of the compound represented by the formula (1) include ethyl diethylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-propylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-butylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-hexylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-octylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-decylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-dodecylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-octadecylphosphonoacetate, ethyl<br>
diphenylphosphonoacetate, decyl diethylphosphonoacetate, dodecyl diethylphosphonoacetate, octadecyl diethylphosphonoacetate, ethyl diethylphosphonopropionate, ethyl di-n-propylphosphonopropionate, ethyl<br><br>
di-n-t)utylphosphonopropionate, ethyl di-n-tiexylphosphonopropionate, ethyl di-n-octylphosphonopropionate, ethyl di-n-decylpliosphonopropionate, ethyl di-n-dodecylphosphonopropionate, etiiyl di-n-octadecylphosphonopropionate, ethyl diphenylphosphonopropionate, decyl diethylphosphonopropionate, dodecyl diethylphosphonopropionate, octadecyl diethylphosphonopropionate, ethyl diethylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl di-n-propylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl di-n-butylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl di-n-hexylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl di-n-octylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl di-n-decylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl di-n-dodecylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl di-n-octadecylphosphonobutyrate, ethyl<br>
diphenylphosphonobutyrate, decyl diethylphosphonob-utyrate, dodecyl diethylphosphonobutyrate and octadecyl diethylphosphonobutyrate.<br>
Ethyl diethylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-propylphosphonoacetate, ethyl di-n-butylphosphonoacetate, ethyl<br>
di-n-hexylphosphonoacetate, decyl diethylphosphonoacetate and octadecyl diethylphosphonoacetate are preferred from the viewpoint of efficacy and handling ease.<br>
In the formula (1), when the number of carbon atoms of Ri to R3 is 20 or less, the melting point of the phosphono-fatty acid ester becomes lower than the production temperature of the polylactic acid or the composition, whereby it can be fully molten and mixed and capture the metal catalyst efficiently. The phosphono-fatty acid ester has an aliphatic hydrocarbon group between the diester<br><br>
ph-osphonate moiety and the carboxyiate moiety. To capture the metal catalyst contained in the polylactic acid efficiently, in the formula (1) , n is preferably an integei of 1 to 3.<br>
The content of the phosphono-fatty acid ester is o. 001 to 0.5 part by weight, preferably 0.02 to 0.2 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polylactic acid. When the content of the phogphono-fatty acid ester is too low, the deactivation efficiency of the residual metal catalyst becomes extremely low, thereby making it impossible to obtain a satisfactory effect. When the content is too high, the contamination of a mold or a nozzle used at the time of molding or spinning becomes marked.<br>
To mix the phosphono-fatty acid ester with the polylactic acid in the present invention, they may be added without being diluted or after they are diluted. For example, when a liquid phosphono-fatty acid ester or a solid phosphono-fatty acid ester having a melting point of lower than 150°C is used, it may be added to a reactor directly to be kneaded in the latter stage of polymerization in the ring-opening polymerization method. It may be kneaded in an extruder or kneader as a master batch which is a molded chip. The use of an extruder or kneader is preferred from the viewpoint of a uniform distribution in the polylactic acid. It is also preferred that the phosphono-fatty acid ester should be added from a side feeder by connecting the discharge part of a reactor to an extruder directly. Meanwhile, in the solid-phase polymerization method, it is possible to knead solid polylactic acid obtained at the end of polymerization with the phosphono-fatty acid ester in an extruder or kneader, to knead the solid polylactic acid with a master batch containing the phosphono-fatty acid ester by an extruder or kneader, to contact the chip directly to steam of the phosphono-fatty acid ester, or to immerse or spray<br><br>
the chip with a solution of the phosphono-fatty acid ester.<br><process of manufacturing composition><br>

Reference Example 1<br>
synthesis of ethyl diethylphosphonoacetate<br>
100 parts by weight of triethyl phosphite and 100 parts by weight of ethyl bromoacetate were put into a reactor equipped with a distillation tube, and the inside of the reactor was substituted by nitrogen.  Subsequently, the<br><br>
reactor was heated at lOO^C to start a reaction.  Since bronvoethane as a by-product began to distill out iinmediately, the reaction was maintained until the distillation-out of bromoethane slowed down.  When the distillation-out of bromoethane became moderate, the reactor was further heated at 150°C to continue the reaction for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was distilled at 180°C under a normal pressure to obtain an achromatic transparent liquid (yield of 95 %, boiling point of 177°C/7eo mmHg).<br>
Reference Example 2<br>
Synthesis of ethyl dibutylphosphonoacetate<br>
100 parts by weight of tributyl phosphite and 66 parts by weight of ethyl bromoacetate were put into a reactor equipped with a distillation tube, and the inside of the reactor was substituted by nitrogen.  Subsequently, the reactor was heated at 120'^C to start a reaction.  Since bromobutane as a by-product began to distill out immediately, the reaction was maintained until the distillation-out of bromoethane slowed down. When the distillation-out of bromoethane became moderate, the reactor was further heated at 170°C to continue the reaction for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was distilled at 180°C under a reduced pressure to obtain an achromatic transparent liquid [yield of 88 %, boiling point of 249°C/760 mmHg).<br>
Reference Example 3<br>
Synthesis of ethyl d-n-hexylphosphonoacetate<br>
100 parts by weight of trihexyl phosphite and 100 parts by weight of ethyl bromoacetate were put into a reactor, and the inside of the reactor was substituted by nitrogen. Subsequently, the reactor was heated at 170°C to carry out a reaction for 3 hours while these substances were heated and refluxed. After excess of ethyl bromoacetate was<br><br>
distilled off at 80°C under a reduced pressure, the reactions-mixture was distilled at 19C°C under a reduced pressure to obtain an achromatic transparent liquid (yield of 84 %, boiling point of l46°C/0.5 mmHg).<br>
reference Example 4<br>
synthesis of octadecyl diethylphposphonoacetate<br>
100 parts by weight of triethyl phosphite and 235 parts by weight of octadecyl bromoacetate were put into a reactor equipped with a distillation tube, and the inside of the reactor was substituted by nitrogen. Subsequently, the reactor was heated at 100°C to start a reaction. Since bromoethane as a by-product began to distill out immediately, the reaction was maintained until the distillation-out of bromoethane slowed down. When the distillation-out of bromoethane became moderate, the reactor was further heated at 150°C to continue the reaction for 3 hours.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was collected by filtration and recrystallized with acetone to obtain a white plate-liXe crystal (yield of 98 %, melting point of 28 to 31°C) .<br>
