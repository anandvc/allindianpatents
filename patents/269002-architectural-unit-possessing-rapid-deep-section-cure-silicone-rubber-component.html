3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to architectural elements possessing at least two components bonded together employing a silicone rubber composition possessing rapid development of strength and deep-section cure.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The skyscraper and "high-rise" building section of the construction industry is growing rapidly, especially in the developing economies. This industry uses sealants to hold various construction materials, e.g., glass windows and metal, together. By its nature this construction takes place at high elevations, as such, specific sealant properties are necessary for this market. These properties include ease of application and very fast development of strength with deep-section cure. Conventional sealants offer ease of application, e.g., one-part sealants. However, conventional silicone polymers systems typically develop strength and deep-section cure rather slowly, i.e., after a few days to a few weeks of exposure to a moist atmosphere.<br>
Moreover, rapid development of strength and deep-section cure is often desired in certain sealant and/or adhesive applications, e.g., "high rise" construction, automotive, and insulating glass applications.<br>
There remains a need within the art for silicone sealants possessing rapid development of strength and deep section cure, i.e., a few hours to a few days.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an architectural element possessing at least two components bonded together or otherwise maintained in sealing relationship to each other employing a silicone rubber composition obtained by the curing of a mixture which comprises:<br>
a)	at least one silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane;<br>
b)	at least one crosslinker for the silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane(s);<br>
c)	at least one catalyst for the crosslinking reaction;<br>
d)	a rapid deep-section curing amount zinc oxide; and optionally,<br>
e)	at least one additional component selected from the group consisting of alkyl-terminated diorganopolysiloxane, filler, UV stabilizer, antioxidant, adhesion promoter, cure accelerator, thixotropic agent, plasticizer, moisture scavenger, pigment, dye, surfactant, solvent and biocide.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein the expression "architectural element" denotes a prefabricated or manufactured unit used in building construction, e.g., a window, in particular, an insulated glass unit ("IGU"), a glass-paneled door, doors containing one or more windows, prefabricated windows, sliding doors with one or more windows, folding doors with one or more windows, curtainwall, shop glazing, structural glazing, skylight, light fixtures, and the like, in which a bonding, bedding glaze, sealant, caulking or adhesive composition is used to bond the glazing to structural elements comprising the architectural element.<br>
As used herein the term "glazing" has its ordinary meaning, a meaning that is inclusive of glass and glass substitutes such as polyacrylates, specifically polymethylmethacrylate and polycarbonates and the like including but not limited to the transparent, translucent and opaque varieties of glazing.<br>
As used herein the expression "bedding glaze," and terms "adhesive," "bonding," "sealant," or "caulking" composition encompasses or comprises the silicone rubber-forming composition of the present invention.<br>
As used herein structural elements are materials used for construction of, e.g., buildings, window frames and window frame assembly, etc., which are made of those materials known in the art, e.g. wood, stone, brick, steel, aluminum, brass, iron, copper, concrete, plastic, plastic covered wood or metal and the like.<br>
The term "compatible" as used herein means the optional component does not negatively or adversely affect in a material way the storage stability of the part in which it is contained and when contained in such part, the intended functions of the optional component is not negatively of adversely affected in a material way.<br><br>
As understood herein the curing of sealant compositions can be expressed as the "tack-free time" or surface curing and "deep-section cure" or curing along the sealant's thickness. Tack-free time is tested by spreading a sealant to the desired thickness (e.g., 6.35 mm) on a Teflon mold and placing a lOg stainless steel (SS) weight on the sealant at different intervals of time. The tack free time is the time when no material sticks to the surface of the weight. Alternatively, "deep-section cure" or curing along the thickness is tested based on the spread material being cut along the thickness periodically to detect the complete curing. The time taken for the material to cure completely along the thickness is called deep section cure, also known as "thick-section cure." Apart from visual observation the inventors have devised a method to measure the deep-section cure, more fully described herein below, by extracting the uncured material of the sealant by solvent.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, insulated glass unit 10 includes glass sheets 1 and 2 maintained in spaced-apart relationship by a gas sealant assembly possessing a primary gas sealant member 4, continuous spacer member 5 and secondary sealant 7. Space 6 between sheets 1 and 2 is filled with an insulating gas or gases such as argon. A rapid deep-section cure bedding glaze composition 8 prepared as hereinafter described is placed between glass sheet 1 and window frame assembly 9. Panes 1 and 2 can be fabricated from any of a variety of materials such as glass, e.g., clear float glass, annealed glass, tempered glass, solar glass, tinted glass, e.g., low energy glass, etc., acrylic resin and polycarbonate resin, and the like.<br>
The utilization of rapid deep-section cure bedding glaze composition 8 (i.e., the silicone rubber-forming composition of the present invention) in the foregoing insulated glass units provides for productivity gains in the manufacture of these units including improved adhesion build and rapid development of strength with deep section cure. Other benefits include long storage life as well as improved application rates of the sealant in addition to providing the required performance attributes of typical bedding glaze sealants including adhesion, adhesive strength and elongation. As a result, the deep-section cure bedding glaze composition 8 can<br><br>
be used as a sealant and/or adhesive because it exhibits high bond strength including a good balance between shearing bond strength and peeling bond strength, and therefore, in particular, holds promise for application as a bedding glaze sealant in the production of various glass units, e.g., glass installation in high-rise buildings.<br>
Primary sealant member 4 of the insulated glass unit 10 can be comprised of polymeric materials known in the art, for example, rubber base materials such as polyisobutylene, butyl rubber, polysulfide, EPDM rubber, nitrile rubber, and the like. Other useful materials include, polyisobutylene/polyisoprene copolymers, polyisobutylene polymers, brominated olefin polymers, copolymers of polisobutylene and para-methylstyrene, copolymers of polyisobutylene and brominated para- methylstyrene, butyl rubber-copolymer of isobutylene and isoprene, ethylene-propylene polymers, polysulfide polymers, polyurethane polymers, styrene butadiene polymers, and the like.<br>
As indicated above, primary gas sealant member 4 can be fabricated from a material such as polyisobutylene which has very good sealing properties. A desiccant can be included in continuous spacer 5 in order to remove moisture from the insulating gas occupied space between glass panes 1 and 2. Useful desiccants are those that do not adsorb the insulating gas/gases filling the interior of the insulated glass unit.<br>
The deep-section cure bedding glaze composition 8 of the present invention is a stable room-temperature curable silicone sealant composition that provides rapid primerless bond strength and deep-section cure as hereinafter more fully described.<br>

Tack Free Time and Deep Section Cure measurements: After applying Examples 1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-2 in Teflon molds with Vi " thickness, the surface was made even with an aluminum spacer. Beginning at the time the material was first applied, the surface was checked with a lOg weight to determine if the material is tack free at 15 minute intervals (minimum) until it is found to be tack-free. Tack free time data of Examples 1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-2 are presented in Figure 3.<br>
Deep-section cure was determined by solvent swelling experiments as follows: A weighed portion of the resin in accordance with Examples 1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-2 was obtained from a cut along the thickness of the mold (a sample of about 5 grams from each of Examples 1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-2 was obtained) and allowed to swell in 100ml of toluene for 3 days. The samples from Example 1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-2 were removed from the toluene and kept for drying under ambient conditions for 3 days. Each sample was weighed again after drying. The difference in weight provides the amount of uncured sample from Example 1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-2 dissolved in toluene. This measurement was obtained at the 6th, 24th and 48* hour after applying the sealant<br><br>
examples in the Teflon mold. The percentage of uncured example was plotted against time.<br>
Deep-section cure data for Comparative Example 1 and Example 1 are presented in Figure 4, and deep-section cure data for Comparative Example 2 and Example 2 are presented in Figure 5.<br>
