Sock<br>
The invention relates to a sock, in particular for application in athletic activities.<br>
Human feet are often accommodated in tight shoes. This is the case in particular when the person moves rapidly and a great deal, e.g., in athletic activities. However, the tight shoes per se cause increased perspiration by the feet. In human athletic activity, this perspiration output is above average. Due to the accumulation of perspiration in the shoes and/or socks, there is an increased risk of blisters developing on the foot, so there have been efforts to facilitate the transport of perspiration out of the shoe and/or sock.<br>
DE 297 15 762 U1 discloses a climate regulating stocking, in particular for use in leisure athletic activities such as jogging, inline skating, skiing or the like, said stocking having at least one integrated air channel made of a climate regulating knit mesh fabric extending from the sole of the foot to the cuff. The climate channel allows most of the resulting moisture to evaporate by conveying the moisture of perspiration out of the sole area of the shoe into an area of the stocking where free evaporation is possible. The known climate regulating stocking fulfills all the tasks required of it. However, this requires that an air channel be provided.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to simplify the conveyance of moisture out of the shoe. According to this invention, this object is achieved by providing at least one pad designed essentially in a rod shape in the area of the ankle.<br>
A sock is created with the present invention, in particular for athletic activities, allowing conveyance of perspiration out of the shoe and/or sock without requiring an air channel to do so. Because a rod-shaped pad is provided in the area of the ankle, it is possible to transport the high levels of moisture that occur in the shoe out of the area. This is ensured by the fact that a gap is created between the sock and the shoe on both sides of the pad, through which aeration and ventilation are possible.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, at least two pads arranged in proximity to one another are provided in the area of the ankle. Due to the neighboring arrangement of multiple pads, the gap between the sock and the shoe is increased, thereby additionally improving ventilation and aeration.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the pads are aligned essentially in parallel to one another. Due to the parallel alignment, one or more channels are formed between the pads. By<br><br>
WO 2006/024260	PCT/DE2005/001446<br>
2<br>
providing multiple pads, the gap formed between the sock and the shoe is increased, thereby further improving the air exchange.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, an air channel is provided optionally on the inside and/or outside of the sock in relation to the leg. This further increase the efficiency in conveying perspiration out of the area of the shoe.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the tread area of the sock has at least one climate channel extending to the outer area of the sock. This yields a uniform climate in the tread area because moisture generated even in the tread area is conveyed away. This results in a pleasant feeling in the tread area.<br>
The sock is advantageously equipped with an X-cross band. The X-cross band supports the ankle in the transitional area between the leg and the foot.<br>
Other embodiments and refined embodiments of the present invention are characterized in the other subclaims. An exemplary embodiment of the invention is depicted in the drawing and described in detail below, showing:<br>
Figure 1	a diagram of a sock with a pad in a side view;<br>
Figure 2	a side view of the sock shown in Figure 1 with a shoe;<br>
Figure 3	a section along line II-III in Figure 2;<br>
Figure 4	a diagram of a sock having two pads in a side view;<br>
Figure 5	a diagram of a sock having a lateral air channel, X-cross band, three pads and<br>
padding in a side view.<br>
The sock A selected as an exemplary embodiment (Figure 1) consists of a foot part 1 and a leg part 2. The foot part 1 has a toe area 11, a heel area 12 and a tread area 13 situated between the toe area and the heel area, The areas 11, 12 and 13 may be made of a reinforced material, as shown in the exemplary embodiment. Use of combinations of materials such as sheared wool with elastic fiber materials, e.g., Elasthane is also possible. The arrangement of additional pads or padding in the aforementioned areas is also possible. The leg part 2 is provided with a cuff 21 on its end facing away from the foot part 1.<br>
The pad 3 designed essentially in the form of a rod is provided on the sock A in the area of the ankle. It has essentially a vertical alignment. The pad 3 has a length partially protruding into the shoe in the condition in which it is worn in a shoe B, while partially protruding out of the shoe. The pad 3 is<br><br>
WO 2006/024260	PCT/DE2005/001446<br>
3<br>
consequently arranged in the transition of the shoe leg part and leads partially out of the shoe leg part (Figure 2).<br>
A gap X is formed by the pad 3 between the sock A and the shoe B in the area of the shoe leg part on both sides of the pad (Figure 3), allowing for aeration and ventilation. By placing the shoe on the floor, the air in the shoe is forced out of it. In the normal case the air can escape only through the ventilation openings in the shoe, but their capacity is very limited. With the help of the pad 3 and the gap X formed by it, an additional possibility for allowing air to escape is created, so that ventilation of the shoe is greatly improved. The same thing is also true conversely in aeration: if the shoe is raised from the floor, air is drawn into the shoe, which is greatly facilitated by the gap X between the sock and the shoe.<br>
To further improve the aeration and ventilation of the shoe, it is possible to provide additional pads 3. In the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 4, two pads 3 are provided. The pads 3 here are aligned almost in parallel so that one or more channels are formed between them. By providing multiple pads 3, the gap formed between the sock A and the shoe B is increased, so that the air exchange is further improved.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 5, the leg part 2 of the sock A is provided with pads 22 in the area of the calf, with rod-shaped padding being provided in the example shown here. Other shapes of pads are also possible. Pads 23 are also arranged in the lower area of the shin developing into the arch of the foot part. The pads may also be arranged in the area of the Achilles tendon.<br>
The pads are generally made of synthetic yarns or compound fabrics or yarn or similar materials. In the exemplary embodiment, the padding of the socks is made of hollow chamber fibers sheathed with spun wool or cotton. The hollow chamber of synthetic yarns are also especially effective in impact and compression damping. The tread area; 13 may be made of microfiber knit, which helps to reduce abrasion. The foot bed is also made of microfibers in the toe and/or heel area, depending on requirements.<br>
The sock A is also equipped with an X-cross band 24 made of an elastic, climate regulating fabric. The X-cross band 24 supports the ankle in the transitional area between the leg and the foot.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown here, an air channel 25 that is made of a climate regulating knit mesh fabric extends from the cuff 21 into the tread area 13. The air channel 25 contributes toward<br><br>
WO 2006/024260	PCT/DE2005/001446<br>
4<br>
diverting moisture upward and out of the tread area. Such an air channel 25 may also be provided on the sock on the inside of the leg or on both sides of the leg.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 5, three pads 3 are provided in the area of the ankle. The two outer pads 3 form the edge of the air channel 25 in some sections in the area of the ankle. The middle pad 3 is arranged in the air channel 25. Pads 3 that are parallel to one another are arranged obliquely. The pads 3 thereby complete the transition from the essentially horizontally aligned foot part 1 to the essentially vertically aligned leg part 2. This transition can be additionally improved by providing a small curve on the end of the pad 3 facing the foot part 1 such that the free end of the curve is aligned approximately horizontally. Similarly, the end of the pad 3 facing away from the foot part 1 may have a small curve, the free end of which is aligned approximately vertically.<br>
The three pads 3 are aligned essentially in parallel. They have different lengths, with the two outer pads 3 being approximately the same length in the exemplary embodiment shown here and with the middle pad 3 having a greater length. They function as described above so that they support the effects of the air channel 25. If air channels 25 are provided on the sock A there is the possibility of widening the pads 3 over the area of the ankle. This is true in particular for the pads 3 forming the edge of the air channel 25. If the pads 3 are designed to be curved in this way and are lengthened in the direction of the leg part 21, then the pads 3 assume the function of air guidance to ensure that the human air escaping from the shoe B will be evaporated and/or guided in the channel 25 provided for this purpose.<br>
Three climate channels 26 are provided in the tread area 13 of the sock. The tread area 13 is interrupted by the climate channels 26. The climate channels 26 begin and end on the outside of the tread area. The climate channels 26 are made of climate regulating knit mesh fabric. They may be designed so that the thickness of the knit mesh fabric corresponds to the thickness of the tread area, thus resulting in a continuous surface. Therefore this has a positive effect on wearing comfort.<br>
If air channels 25 are provided on the inside and outside of the leg of sock A, then the climate channels 26 extend between the air channels 25 on the inside and outside of the leg. The number and dimensions of the climate channels 26 are essentially freely selectable. In the connection of the air channels 26 to the inside and outside of the legs, optimum air circulation in the shoe is induced, making it possible for a maximum amount of atmospheric humidity to be conveyed out of the shoe and/or sock.<br><br>
