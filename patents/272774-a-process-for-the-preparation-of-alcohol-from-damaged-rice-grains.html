				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
<br>
The present application claims priority to Indian Provisional Patent Application No. 1897/CHE/2008, filed Aug. 6, 2008, which is incorporated by reference herein.	<br>
<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION <br>
<br>
The invention relates ethanol production, more particularly process for the production of ethanol from damaged rice which is unfit for human and cattle consumption using yeast under anaerobic condition.<br>
<br>
BACKROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Petroleum provides the single largest fraction of the world's energy, accounting for about 37 % of the total world energy used. However, for most countries, much of this petroleum has to be imported, and a large fraction (about 30 %) comes from politically volatile locations in the Persian Gulf. Furthermore, petroleum imports are the largest single contributor to trade deficits for many countries. Burning petroleum for power also contributes to a major portion of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, raising concerns about global climate change. Ultimately, petroleum use is not sustainable, and new sources of energy are needed to address a range of important economic, environmental, and strategic issues and insure a perpetual energy supply. A large portion of petroleum is used for transportation, and the transportation sector is almost totally dependent on petroleum, particularly for powering personal vehicles and trucks. Furthermore, X the transportation sector is rapidly expanding in developing countries such as India, straining the supply of petroleum even more. Thus, new sources of sustainable transportation fuels would not only address the problems associated with such a high dependence on petroleum in developed countries but also keep developing countries from facing similar problems.<br>
Most of the immediate expansion in ethanol production in these and other countries is expected to rely on traditional technologies for use of grains (e.g., from corn and wheat) and some sugar (e.g., cane and beet sugar). However, ethanol can be made from very inexpensive and abundant sources of cellulosic biomass including agricultural residues (e.g., corn stover and sugarcane bagasse), forestry wastes (e.g., sawdust and paper sludge), and herbaceous and woody energy crops (e.g., switchgrass and poplar), and these materials insure a supply of inexpensive feedstock that can extend ethanol production, particularly if large scale use of grains puts upward pressure on grain prices and reduces co- product selling prices. Cellulosic ethanol technology can also be the low cash cost producer of ethanol. However, although substantial improvements have been made in reducing the cost of converting cellulosic biomass to ethanol, the technology has not been proven commercially. In this context, it is important to note that first-of-a kind facilities have high capital costs and are considered more risky than application of existing technologies, and implementing unproven technology presents seriou$ challenges.<br>
<br>
At this juncture, rice has the potential of becoming a useful energy crop. Rice production in the World has been increasing steadily from 200 million tons in 1960 to 600 million in 2004. In this, milled rice constitutes 68 % of total weight of paddy rice. In the year 2004, top three rice producers are China (31 % of world production), India (20 %), and Indonesia (9 %). The milled rice always produced byproducts some of which could not be used for human consumption. Like other traditional fermented alcoholic beverages rice wines are already popular in most of the Asian countries, indicating the possibility of using them as the substrate for alcohol production. Though fresh starchy materials are required for human consumption, a large quantity of different grains is spoiled every year in India if because of unfavorable climatic conditions and inadequate transport and storage facilities.<br>
<br>
Damaged grains are generally rendered unfit for human consumption. The damage includes discolored, broken, cracked, attacked by fungi, insect damaged, chalky, partially softened by being damp, dirty and bad smell, etc. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) classes the damaged grains in five categories based on percentage of sound grains, 70 % and over used as cattle feed, 55 - 70 % as poultry feed, 30 - 55 % as industrial use, 10-30 % as manure and less than 10 % dumping.<br>
<br>
In the case of lignocellulose / starch their conversion to ethanol involves four . steps: (1) pretreatment (2) enzymatic saccharification, (3) fermentation of mixed sugars to ethanol, and (4) product recovery. However, the native biomass is generally resistant to enzymatic attack. Pretreatment of lignocellulose / starch becomes essential before enzymatic saccharification can ensue. Pretreatment with dilute acid at a moderate temperature has become a state of the art technology for any biomass substrate with ethanol recoveries under these conditions reported as 50 j- 60 % from available sugars. However, Starch found locked in rice mill waste is simple to hydrolysis than cellulose hydrolysis. The manufacture of rice based alcohol can be characterized as the conversion of rice by physical, microbiological and biochemical operations including steaming, inoculation with starter, mashing and fermentation. Broadly it has three steps viz., liquefaction of starch, saccharification and fermentation of sugars to ethanol. A lot of microorganism (e.g. Zymomonas mobiiis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) producing alcohol have been reported / used worldwide.<br>
<br>
Anhydrous ethanol, that is, ethanol with at most 1 % water, can be blended with gasoline in varying quantities to reduce consumption of petroleum fuels and in attempts to reduce air pollution.<br>
<br>
Sree et al., Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering, 20, (6), (1999) disclosed a Solid Substrate Fermentation system (SSF) method to produce ethanol from various starchy substrates like sweet sorghum, wheat flour, rice starch, soluble starch and potato starch using thermotolerant yeast isolate by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. Alcohol produced was superior in rice starch than sweet sorghum. The maximum amount of ethanol produced from these substrates was 10 g/100 g and 3.5 g/100 g substrate (rice starch) and 8.2 g and 7.5 g/100 g substrate (sweet sorghum) respectively. Suresh, K et al., Bioresource Technology, 68, (1999), disclosed a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation method to produce ethanol from raw starch of damaged quality wheat and sorghum grains by utilizing crude amylase preparation from Bacilus subtilis and amylolytic yeast strain S. cerevisiae. 25 % raw starch of fine quality wheat and sorghum grains gave a yield of 5.6 % v/v and 5.0 % v/v ethanol respectively. The process was carried out at 35 degree C, pH -5.8 and 200 rpm for 4 days.<br>
<br>
Saha, B.C, et a!., Biotechnology Progress, 21, (2005), 816-822 disclosed yet another method for producing alcohol using dilute acid process which is limited to a sugar recovery efficiency of around 50 %, the reason for this at least two reactions are part of this process. The first reaction converts the cellulosic material to sugars and the second reaction converts the sugars to other chemicals.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it is important to identify an organic feedstock which is not involved in the food chain for ethanol production using current efficient technology. Therefore it is an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a process for producing alcohol from different quality rice from various source, particularly damaged rice.<br>
<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a process for producing alcohol from different quality rice from various sources using dilute sulphuric acid to convert starch into simple sugars, which is then fermented with yeast to produce alcohol.<br>
<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention to provide an industrially viable and economical method for, producing alcohol from damaged rice. <br>
Still another object of the present invention to provide a method for producing alcohol from damaged rice wherein the said method consumes very less energy during pretreatment.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the first embodiment of the present invention is to provide a process for producing alcohol from different quality rice from various sources. It is further embodiment of the invention to provide a process wherein the organic feedstock is a waste product from a rice mill.<br>
<br>
It is further embodiment of the invention to provide a process wherein the organic if feedstock undergone different form dry, wet and control.<br>
<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention, the damaged rice containing about 70 % starch is converted into monosaccharides when treated with dilute sulphuric acid at 60 degree C to 120 degree C for 20 - 50 minutes wherein the dilute sulphuric acid used between 3 % and 25 %.<br>
<br>
It is further embodiment of the invention to provide a process wherein the hydrolyzed product is a sugar containing aqueous material. Another embodiment of the present invention, the hydrolyzed product was fermented by using yeast under anaerobic condition to obtain alcohol.<br>
<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
<br>
Acid hydrolysis of damaged rice<br>
<br>
Incubation at varying conditions<br>
The organic feedstock optionally milled was used for further studies. One part of organic feedstock treated with 5-10 parts of mineral acid at different concentration (1 - 25) at room temperature (25 - 32 degree C) for 6 - 8 h. The hydrolysate optionally separated by used centrifugation force at 10,000 rpm for 5 - 20 min. The hydrolysate was neutralized with alkali and determined for sugars.<br>
<br>
Rice milled or in original size, was hydrolyzed in the first-stage hydrolysis using various methods that include physical, thermal and chemical treatments. The hydrolysis was carried out at the presence of 1 - 20 concentrations mineral acid.<br>
<br>
The most important results of the hydrolysis were summarized in Figures 1-5.<br>
Further studies, 1-20 concentrations mineral acid used to hydrolyze rice. The results indicate that the initiation of maximum sugar release occurred in 10 concentration mineral acid and it increased dramatically in the presence of 20 concentrations H2SO4. Since maximum initiation of sugar release has occurred in even diluted concentrations H2SO4, and it was also recommended that use of dilute acid for pretreatment would not have any post production problems in the form of acid disposal. <br>
<br>
Acid hydrolysis at varying temperatures<br>
<br>
One part of rice milled was treated with 10 concentrations sulphuric acid and hydrolyzed overnight at 25 - 32 degree C. The hydrolysate product was collected by centrifugation force, neutralized with alkali and estimated for reducing sugars. One part of rice milled was treated with 10 concentrations sulphuric acid at 37 degree C optionally 10 -12 h. The partial treated product was hydrolyzed at pressurized (10 lb) temperature for 20 min. The hydrolyzed product was collected by centrifugation force, neutralized with alkali and estimated for reducing sugars.<br>
<br>
One part of rice milled powder was treated with 10 concentrations of sulphuric acid; the hydrolyzed product was neutralized with alkali and estimated for reducing sugars.<br>
<br>
Studies conducted on acid hydrolysis of rice milled and incubating in different conditions indicated that no incubation is required. Processing the samples immediately after autoclaving released maximum sugar around 52.7 percentages than allowing the hydrolysis process at 37 degree C and at room temperature.<br>
<br>
Acid hydrolysis at varying physical treatment<br>
<br>
One part of rice milled or wet rice paste or grain original was treated with 10 concentrations sulphuric acid and hydrolyzed under pressurized (10 lb)<br>
temperature for 20 min. The hydrolyzed product was collected by centrifugation force, neutralized with alkali then estimated for reducing sugars.<br>
<br>
The resulting hydrolyzed fractions from grain original are then subjected to<br>
fermentation as described; below. The hydrolyzed product was found to be<br>
maximum 59 percentages.<br>
<br>
Thermo chemical process in hydrolysis<br>
<br>
One part of rice original was treated with 10 concentrations of sulphuric acid at 100 degree C for 15 or 30 or 45 min. The hydrolyzed fraction was collected by centrifugation force, neutralized with alkali and then estimated for reducing sugars.<br>
<br>
When the acid hydrolysis with 10 concentrations H2S04 was performed at 100 degree C, maximum sugar production of 59 percentages was obtained in 30 min. This was found to be same as the rice sample incubated under the influence of pressure different in time interval, which was 45 min. <br>

<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
<br>
Saccharification of organic feedstocks of rice mill<br>
<br>
Ten different organic feedstocks of rice mill was taken for hydrolysis studies and tested for reducing sugars.<br>
<br>
In this process, maximum sugar release (&gt;70 %) was obtained in samples 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10. This trend was observed even in poor quality, cheaper rice variety (5 to 8) where the sugar release reached the maximum. The sugar release in rice husk (sample 9) was very low compared to others since it is a cellulosic waste that needs a different approach in terms of pretreatment for complete hydrolysis. Since all the substrates (Rice No. 1-9) were found to release a considerable amount of sugars (Figure-6) and are available in abundance, inexpensive, and fairly high in potential energy, they were used for fermentation by Yeast under anaerobic conditions. <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
<br>
Ethanol Production from hydrolyzed organic feedstocks of rice mill The resulted hydrolysate was taken in a pre-sterilized container. 10% of the mother culture was inoculated and fermented, at 25 - 32 degree C 72 hrs. The sample was taken to analyze the production of ethanol.<br>
<br>
In the process, the alcohol production was preceded by treating the samples with optimized concentrations of sulphuric acid. Two different baker's and brewer's yeast strains were used as fermenting microorganisms for conversion of rice hydrolyzed product to alcohol. The final alcohol yield from separate hydrolysis and fermentation is 31g/100g (w/w).<br>
<br>
Normally alcohol production from different substrates banks on the quality of substrate, the method engaged to release hydrolyzed product from the organic feedstock and conversion of hydrolyzed product to fermentative product. In the present study, the rice mill products and wastes were studied for conversion to alcohol.<br>
<br>
In this invention, rice based alcohol production was studied to determine the various parameters required for maximum alcohol recovery. In the present study the intact and broken rice samples were used for alcohol production. The first step was the hydrolysis of the rice to release maximum amount of sugars. This was done using physical, chemical and thermal treatments in the presencetof dilute sulphuric acid.<br>
