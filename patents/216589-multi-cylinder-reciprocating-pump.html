COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SECTION 10)<br>
Multi-cylinder Reciprocating pump<br>
Shakun Das, Near Gayatri Mandir, Vikas Khand, Baram Kela, Taluk: Sarangarh, Raigarh,<br>
Chattisgarh, MP, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed<br>
68-MUM-2003<br>
              24-05-04<br>
1 9 MAY 2004<br><br>
The invention relates a multi-cylinder reciprocating pump to discharge liquids such as water. The device is useful for pumping water from rivers, ponds, wells and the like water sources, thus enabling the farmers for pumping water for example for irrigation purposes.<br>
Reciprocating pumps are commonly employed to remove or pump, collected liquid, such as water, from a given source such as a deep well. For example, a user may easily pump out water from the bottom of a well. For landscaping, irrigation installation, and construction applications, a portable multi-cylinder reciprocating water pump may be conveniently used to suck water efficiently from the source. These and a wide variety of other applications may be easily accomplished with the use of a portable reciprocating pump to avoid employing other less convenient approaches.<br>
One of the conventional reciprocating pumps known in the art comprises a piston cylinder assembly adapted to be operated manually or by motive means. These pumps are commonly used to lift water from the bore wells, wells, ponds, rivers etc.<br>
Another known pump comprises a plurality of piston and cylinder assemblies such that the piston of each assembly is adapted to be operated by means of a cam so as to provide to and fro motion to the piston. In this pump when one pump assembly sucks the water the other assembly supply the water towards the outlet. This process continues due to the to and fro motion of the pistons and continues water/liquid supply is received at the outlet end.<br>
Further other reciprocating water pumps have been developed and are commercially available. While prior art of reciprocating pumps of the type are widely used, many of the existing reciprocating pumps are designed, manufactured and sold as disposable units with pumping components, which are permanently sealed together. Since, reciprocating pumps are generally known to be susceptible to mechanical failures, especially when pumping liquids containing mud, sand and other particulate. Because the prior art pump units arer4made up of components that are not easily accessible or replaceable, it is very difficult or impossible for a user to repair a component when repairs become necessary. Accordingly, the user is generally expected to replace the entire pump when failure<br>
-2-<br><br>
occurs. This can be particularly bothersome to a user who would rather replace or repair an inexpensive component and be back in business within a few minutes with a serviceable pump, instead of having to leave the job site and make a trip to a store to purchase an entirely new pump at an added cost.<br>
In addition, many of the prior art reciprocating pumps are designed to pump liquids out during the exhaust or outlet port primarily during the upstroke of the plunger mechanism, and very little on the down-stroke. Accordingly, the prior art reciprocating pumps are not believed to provide for optimum pumping capacity in each direction. Such prior pumping approaches tend to ignore the ergonomics of reciprocal movement, and the amount of physical strength required by the user in each direction, especially for larger pumps where greater manual force is necessary to pump larger volumes of liquids.<br>
A disadvantage associated with the prior art is that a lot of energy is required to lift small amount of water and in a discontinuous manner.<br>
It is therefore one object of the present invention to provide for a multi-cylinder reciprocating water pump that is manufactured and assembled with inexpensive components that are easily connected together in a manner that enables a user to easily disassemble and repair the pump with a few simple hand tools when necessary.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a versatile pump kit that has a preÂ¬selected group of interchangeable spares and accessories to choose from, which group easily enables a user to employ the pump under a variety of conditions, and for a variety of purposes or uses.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a pump that is capable of efficiently and ergonomically pumping liquid during both the upstroke movement and down-stroke movement of the plunger mechanism each cylinder.<br>
-3-<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide for a sturdy liquid reciprocating pump that addresses the above-specified needs and yet is inexpensive, easy to use, to understand, and to repair to render the pump virtually good as new. The main advantage of this multi-cylinder pump is that it can deliver liquid more uniformly than that of a single cylinder pump. By using a suitable disposition of the discharge from the individual cylinder the total discharge of the multi-cylinder pump can be made to nearly equal to the mean discharge with negligible fluctuation without the use of an air vessel. One advantage of the present invention is that no chemical glue or solvent is required as part of constructing this pump, even though it is made primarily from automobile accessories, spares of agricultural and automobile implements. This pump can be operated manually as well as with an electrical motor.<br>
A further object of present invention is to provide a multi-cylinder reciprocating pump which can be used to lifting water from all kind of water sources like river, wells, bore wells, and ponds etc.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-cylinder reciprocating pump which can be transported easily from one place to another place.<br>
The following description contains many specifics; these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible accordingly the scope of the invention should not be limited to the embodiment illustrated, and the alterations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
Another advantage of the pumps of the present invention is that each component is replaceable if it should break, typically with low- cost replacement parts that are readily available in most hardware or plumbing supply stores. There are specific parts, which are expected to wear out with long, extensive use or rough use. Still another advantage of multi-cylinder reciprocating pump of the present invention is that they provide an ergonomic pumping action, characterized by equal pumping action or volume in both the<br>
_4_<br><br>
upstroke direction and the down-stroke direction.<br>
