BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a reproduction apparatus for reproducing the<br>
data stored in a recording medium. This application is divided out of Indian Patent<br>
Application No. 1850/CAL/96 (hereinafter referred to as "parent application").<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART:<br>
Recently, laser disks and video CDs (compact disks) have been input into practical use as optical<br>
recording media for storing multi-media data including<br>
moving picture data, audio data and sub-picture data.<br>
Among these media, video CDs are used for storing<br>
moving picture data on a CD, having a memory capacity of<br>
about 600 megabytes and originally used for storing<br>
digital audio data, using MPEG. MPEG is a technology for<br>
compressing moving picture data at a high ratio. Many<br>
laser disks used in a variety of fields, for example,<br>
laser disks used in "karaoke" bars to show the singer the<br>
lyrics of the song are being replaced with video CDs.<br>
Today, active studies are being conducted to<br>
improve the memory capacity of optical disks. In order<br>
to raise the memory capacity of optical disks, the diame-<br>
ter D of a light spot on the optical disk needs to be<br>
reduced. Where the wavelength of the laser light is k<br>
and the numerical aperture of the objective lens is NA,<br>
the diameter D of the light, spot is in proportion to<br>
Î»/NA. That is, the memory capacity can be higher as the<br>
wavelength k is smaller and the numerical aperture NA is<br>
greater.<br><br>
When a lens having a greater numerical aperture<br>
is used, frame aberration caused by tilt, which is the<br>
relative angle of the optical axis of the optical beam<br>
with respect to the surface of the optical disk, increas-<br>
es as described in, for example, the United States Patent<br>
No. 5,235,581. In order to prevent the frame aberration,<br>
the thickness of the transparent substrate needs to be<br>
reduced. A thinner substrate has a lower mechanical<br>
strength, which can be effectively compensated for by<br>
reinforcing the substrate with another substrate. The<br>
reinforcement is more effective when the two substrates<br>
have an identical thickness and are formed of an identi-<br>
cal material.<br>
Digital video disks (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
"DVDs") are also being developed today. For reading data<br>
from the DVD, a semiconductor laser for generating red<br>
light having a wavelength of as short as 650 nm and an<br>
optical system including an objective lens having a<br>
numerical aperture of as great as 0.6 mm are used. A DVD<br>
having a 120 mm diameter for storing 5 gigabyte data on<br>
one side has been proposed by using the above-mentioned<br>
semiconductor laser and optical system in combination<br>
with a substrate having a thickness of as small as<br>
0.6 mm.<br>
Memory disks having such a large memory capacity<br>
show their specific value in the field of multimedia, in<br>
which a plurality of moving picture data, a plurality of<br>
audio data, a plurality of graphic data and the like are<br>
reproduced through dialogue with the user.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
described by way of illustrative examples with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings.<br><recording medium><br>
Various types of data can be recorded in a<br>
recording medium as one data file. For example, audio<br>
data and display data for one title can be recorded as<br>
one data file. Each data file includes a plurality of<br>
types of audio data and a plurality of types of display<br>
data. The plurality of types of audio data include, for<br>
example, audio data in a plurality of languages such as<br>
Japanese audio data and English audio data. The plurali-<br>
ty of types of display data include, for example, charac-<br>
ter data in a plurality of languages such as Japanese<br>
character data and English character data, and also<br>
include graphic data.<br>
A unit of data obtained by dividing the audio<br><br>
data or the display data stored in each data file by a<br>
unit of a prescribed time period t is referred to as a<br>
"pack". A plurality of types of audio data are packed<br>
type by type, whereas a plurality of types of display<br>
data are packed as one pack regardless of the type.<br>
The audio data can be coded with one of several<br>
different systems such as the linear PCM system used for<br>
CDs or the like, the MPEG audio system which is an<br>
international standard, and the AC3 system used for DVDs<br>
or the like. The audio data is recorded in the recording<br>
medium in the state of being coded.<br>
(Recording medium: example 1)<br>
Hereinafter, a first example of a recording<br>
medium according to the present invention will be de-<br>
scribed .<br>
Figure 1 shows a structure of data to be recorded<br>
in a recording medium in the first example. In this<br>
example, the structure of the data corresponding to<br>
three tunes (i.e., three data files) to be recorded in<br>
the recording medium will be described.<br>
Recording data 101 to be recorded into the<br>
recording medium includes volume information 102 and a<br>
plurality of files.<br>
In the volume information 102, physical manage-<br>
ment information of each file regarding the recording<br>
medium, such as the recording start address and data size<br>
of each file is stored.<br><br>
Each of the plurality of files includes a manage-<br>
ment information file 104 and a data file group 105.<br>
The management information file 104 includes a<br>
plurality of units of file attribute information 110. In<br>
each unit of file attribute information 110, information<br>
on the attributes of the corresponding data file among<br>
the three data files is described. In the example shown<br>
in Figure 1, the units of file attribute information<br>
110(1) through 110(3) regarding the three data files are<br>
described in the management information file 104.<br>
Each unit of file attribute information 110 in-<br>
cludes title attributes, audio data management informa-<br>
tion 111, and display data management information 112.<br>
In the title attributes, attributes of the data<br>
file such as the name of the title, the order of repro-<br>
duction, and reproduction time are described.<br>
In the audio data management information 111,<br>
management information on the audio data such as the<br>
number of types of audio data, information on the types<br>
of audio data, and reproduction time is recorded.<br>
Recorded in, for example, the audio data management<br>
information 111 regarding title 1 shown in Figure 1 are<br>
(1) information that the number of the types of audio<br>
data is 4 and (2) information on the types of audio data,<br>
i.e., the information that represents that Japanese audio<br>
information, English audio information, French audio<br>
information, and German audio information are stored.<br>
Also recorded in audio data management information 111 is<br>
information representing the data format of the audio<br><br>
data. The information representing the data format is<br>
used to, for example, identify one of the coding systems<br>
among the linear PCM, MPEG audio, and AC3 systems, which<br>
was used for coding the audio data.<br>
In the display data management information 112,<br>
management information on the display data such as the<br>
number of types of display data, information on the types<br>
of display data, and reproduction time is recorded.<br>
Recorded in, for example, the display data management<br>
information 112 regarding title 1 shown in Figure 1 are<br>
(1) information that the number of the types of display<br>
data is 7 and (2) information on the types of display<br>
data, i.e., the information that represents that Japanese<br>
character information 1, English character information 2,<br>
French character information 3, and German character<br>
information 4, musical note information, logo information<br>
and graphic information are stored. Also recorded in the<br>
display data management information 112 is information<br>
representing the data format of the display data. The<br>
information representing the data format is used to, for<br>
example, determine whether the display data (bit map<br>
data) has been compression-coded using run length coding<br>
or the like or non-compression-coded.<br>
By referring to the management information file<br>
104, a reproduction apparatus can identify the number of<br>
titles stored in the recording medium, names of the<br>
titles, the reproduction time, the types of the audio<br>
data, whether display data is stored or not, the types of<br>
the display, and the like.<br>
When a plurality of types of display data are<br><br>
stored in the recording medium, the reproduction appara-<br>
tus can selectively output one of the plurality of types<br>
of display data. The plurality of types of display data<br>
can include character information in a plurality of lan-<br>
guages. When such a recording medium is combined with a<br>
reproduction apparatus having a function of selectively<br>
outputting the character information in any one of a<br>
plurality of languages, a multi-lingual system is real-<br>
ized.<br>
The data file group 105 includes a plurality of<br>
data files 120 which respectively correspond to the<br>
titles. In the example shown in Figure 1, the data files<br>
120(1) through 120(3) correspond to the three titles.<br>
Each data file 120 includes a plurality of<br>
recording units 121. Each of the plurality of recording<br>
units 121 includes packs each obtained by dividing the<br>
audio data or the display data by a unit of prescribed<br>
time period t. A plurality of types of audio data are<br>
packed type by type, but a plurality of types of display<br>
data are packed as one pack regardless of the type.<br>
Accordingly, each recording unit 121 includes one display<br>
data pack 123 and a plurality of audio data packs 125.<br>
The plurality of audio data packs 125 will be collective-<br>
ly referred to as an audio data pack group 124.<br>
As described later in detail, the display data<br>
pack 123 includes a display data group 135, which in-<br>
cludes a plurality of types of display data 152.<br>
In the case where character information and<br>
simple graphic data are displayed as display data in a<br><br>
liquid crystal display provided in a reproduction appara-<br>
tus, the amount of the display data is smaller than the<br>
amount of the audio data. The reason is that the amount<br>
of the plurality of types of display data becomes<br>
substantially equal to the amount of one audio data pack<br>
by being packed into one pack. This facilitates manage-<br>
ment of the data amount performed pack by pack.<br>
The display data pack 123 includes a header 134.<br>
In the header 134, management information for the display<br>
data pack 123 is described. Each audio data pack 125 in-<br>
cludes a header 132. In the header 132, management<br>
information for the audio data pack 125 is described.<br>
The reproduction apparatus analyzes the header of<br>
each pack to identify an attribute of the pack. For<br>
example, the reproduction apparatus analyzes the headers<br>
132 of the plurality of audio data packs 125 to select<br>
one audio data pack 125 of a prescribed type, and repro-<br>
duces the selected audio data pack 125. Regarding the<br>
display data, the reproduction apparatus separates the<br>
display data pack 123 from the rest of the recording unit<br>
121 and then analyzes the header 134 of the display data<br>
pack 123. Thus, the reproduction apparatus selects<br>
display data 152 of a prescribed type among the plurality<br>
of types of display data 152 and reproduces the selected<br>
display data 152. By performing selection of audio data<br>
and display data in the separate processes as described<br>
above, the audio data and display data can be selected<br>
independently.<br>
The recording unit 121 further includes a repro-<br>
duction control pack 122, in which control information on<br><br>
reproduction of data packs is stored. The reproduction<br>
control pack 122 includes a header 130 and control<br>
information 131. Described in the header 130 are, for<br>
example, a start code for identifying the start of the<br>
reproduction control pack 122, an identification code for<br>
identifying that the pack is the reproduction control<br>
pack 122, the number of packs included in the recording<br>
unit 121, system information such as a data transfer rate<br>
and a buffer memory size required for data reproduction,<br>
and a data length of the control information 131.<br>
Described in the control information 131 are, for exam-<br>
ple, reproduction control information used for normal<br>
reproduction, such as reproduction time, and data re-<br>
trieval control information used for special reproduc-<br>
tion, such as the address to be read next during the fast<br>
reproduction.<br>
The audio data pack 125 will now be described in<br>
detail. Each audio data pack 125 includes the header 132<br>
and an audio data stream 133. Described in the header<br>
132 are, for example, a start code for identifying the<br>
start of the audio data pack 125, an identification code<br>
for identifying that the pack is the audio data pack 125,<br>
an audio data identification code for identifying the<br>
type of the audio data included in the audio data pack<br>
125, reproduction time information 150, data format<br>
identification information for identifying the data<br>
format of the audio data stream 133, and a data length of<br>
the audio data stream 133.<br>
The reproduction apparatus identifies an audio<br>
data pack 125 of a prescribed type by referring to the<br>
audio data identification code stored in the header 132.<br><br>
Thus, the audio data pack 125 storing, for example, the<br>
Japanese audio data can be selectively reproduced. The<br>
audio data stream 133 has been coded with the linear PCM,<br>
MPEG audio, AC3 system or the like. The reproduction<br>
apparatus identifies the data format of the audio data<br>
stream 133 by referring to the data format identification<br>
information stored in the header 132. In accordance with<br>
the data format thereof, an appropriate reproduction<br>
system of the audio data stream 133 can be selected. As<br>
a result, audio data of a plurality of data formats can<br>
be reproduced by one reproduction apparatus.<br>
The display data pack 123 will now be described<br>
in detail. The display data pack 123 includes the header<br>
134	and a display data group 135. The display data group<br>
135	includes the plurality of types of display data 152.<br>
Described in the header 134 are, for example, a start<br>
code for identifying the start of the display data pack<br>
123, an identification code for identifying that the pack<br>
is the display data pack 123, reproduction time informa-<br>
tion 151, and a data length of the display data group<br>
135.<br>
The reproduction time information 151 stored in<br>
the display data pack 123 and the reproduction time<br>
information 150 stored in the audio data pack 125 are<br>
used to reproduce and output the display data and the<br>
audio data synchronously with each other. The reproduc-<br>
tion time information 151 represents the time to repro-<br>
duce the display data pack 123, and the reproduction time<br>
information 150 represents the time to reproduce the<br>
audio data pack 125. The reproduction apparatus controls<br>
the display data and the audio data to be output<br><br>
synchronously with each other by comparing the reproduc-<br>
tion time information 151 stored in the display data pack<br>
123 and the reproduction time information 150 stored in<br>
the audio data pack 125.<br>
As described above, the display data group 135<br>
includes the plurality of types of display data 152, for<br>
example, character information in a plurality of languag-<br>
es such as Japanese character information, English<br>
character information, French character information, and<br>
German character information, as well as musical note<br>
information, logo information and graphic information.<br>
Each of the plurality of types of display data<br>
152 includes an identification code 137, data format<br>
identification information 138, a data length 139, and<br>
bit map data 140. The identification code 137 is used<br>
for identifying the type of the display data 152. The<br>
data length 139 represents the length of the bit map data<br>
140 described thereafter. By using the identification<br>
code 137 and the data length 139, a desired type of<br>
display data 152, for example, display data representing<br>
a Japanese character string or display data representing<br>
a musical note may be reproduced. The data format<br>
identification information 138 is used for determining<br>
whether the bit map data 140 has been compression-coded<br>
using run length coding or non-compression-coded. The<br>
reproduction apparatus selects an appropriate reproduc-<br>
tion system in accordance with the data format identified<br>
by referring to the data format identification informa-<br>
tion 138. Thus, the bit map data 140 can be reproduced<br>
and output regardless of the data format.<br><br>
The audio data can represent a plurality of<br>
languages such as Japanese, English and French. The<br>
present invention is not limited to the types or number<br>
of types of audio data.<br>
The display data can represent a plurality of<br>
character strings in a plurality of languages such as<br>
Japanese and English. The display data can represent a<br>
musical note corresponding to the audio data reproduced<br>
simultaneously therewith. The display data can represent<br>
a graphic such as a logo. The present invention is not<br>
limited to the types or number of types of display data.<br>
The recording medium according to the present<br>
invention can store a plurality of types of audio data<br>
and a plurality of types of display data in a recording<br>
unit within a unit of prescribed time period t. For<br>
example, when character strings in a plurality of lan-<br>
guages of a plurality of countries are recorded in the<br>
recording medium as display data, such a recording medium<br>
can be commonly supplied in the plurality of countries.<br>
From the viewpoint of software producers, such a<br>
common recording medium has a significant effect of<br>
eliminating a complicated procedure of producing, supply-<br>
ing and managing software in correspondence with each of<br>
a plurality of languages and of allowing them to produce,<br>
supply and manage software common for the plurality of<br>
languages.<br>
From the viewpoint of users, such a common<br>
recording medium, which allows them to select any of the<br>
plurality of languages, provides a high quality user<br><br>
interface.<br>
The display data is usable for displaying graph-<br>
ics, such as a logo, as well as characters. For example,<br>
by reproducing the display data representing the sheet<br>
music or musical notes of a tune stored as the audio data<br>
synchronously with the audio data, the sheet music or<br>
musical notes can be displayed while the tune is played.<br>
Thus, a higher quality user interface can be provided.<br>
The time period t used as a unit for packing is<br>
arbitrary. For example, the time period t can be 0.5 /<br>
second.	/&gt;<br>
The start of each pack can be matched with the<br>
start of a recording sector having a capacity of, for<br>
example, 2048 bytes. Thus, the recording position on the<br>
recording medium can be managed more easily.<br>
The size of the display data pack 123 is arbi-<br>
trary. For example, the data size can be about 2048<br>
bytes.<br>
The size of the display data group 135 is arbi-<br>
trary. It is preferable that the size of the display<br>
data pack 123 and the size of the display data group 135<br>
have a specific relationship. For example, when the size<br>
of the display data pack 123 is about 2048 bytes, the<br>
size of the display data group 135 is preferably about<br>
2019 bytes. When the size of the display data group 135<br>
is less than 2019 bytes, the size of the display data<br>
group 135 is preferably adjusted by inserting stuffing<br>
data or the like.<br><br>
In the first example of a recording medium<br>
according to the present invention, data for one title is<br>
recorded as one data file. The present invention is not<br>
limited to such a system. Data for one title can be<br>
divided and recorded into a plurality of data files. In<br>
such a case, information regarding the division (for<br>
example, relationship between the plurality of data<br>
files) is described in the management information file<br>
104.<br>
The header 134 of the display data pack 123, the<br>
header 130 of the reproduction control pack 122, and the<br>
header 132 of the audio data pack 125 which are described<br>
in detail above are only exemplary, and the present<br>
invention is not limited to such structures for the<br>
headers. In these headers, information regarding other<br>
data packs can be described.<br>
(Recording medium: example 2)<br>
A second example of a recording medium according<br>
to the present invention will now be described.<br>
A recording medium in the second example accord-<br>
ing to the present invention has a structure similar to<br>
that of the recording medium in the first example. In<br>
the second example also, the display data pack 123 and<br>
the audio data packs 125 are recorded in the recording<br>
medium as shown in Figure 1. The recording medium in the<br>
second example is different from the recording medium in<br>
the first example in that at least one of the plurality<br>
of types of display data 152 included in the display data<br>
group 135 is character information corresponding to the<br>
audio data. For example, when Japanese audio data is<br><br>
recorded, a Japanese character string can be recorded as<br>
at least one of the plurality of types of display data<br>
152 in the display data group 135. For example, lyrics<br><br>
or liner notes in the same language as that of the music<br>
software can be recorded as display data 152. According-<br>
ly, data in a plurality of languages can be stored in one<br>
recording medium as display data.<br>
From the viewpoint of software producers, such a<br>
common recording medium has a significant effect, for<br>
example, as described in the first example. From the<br>
viewpoint of users, such a common recording medium, which<br>
allows them to selectively display lyrics of a song in<br>
any of the plurality of languages, provides a high<br>
quality user interface.<br>
(Recording medium: example 3)<br>
A third example of a recording medium according<br>
to the present invention will now be described.<br>
A recording medium in the third example according<br>
to the present invention has a structure similar to that<br>
of the recording medium in the first example. In the<br>
third example also, the display data pack 123 and the<br>
audio data packs 125 are recorded in the recording medium<br>
as shown in Figure 1. The recording medium in the third<br>
example is different from that of the first example in<br>
that the display data is level-sliced bit map data which<br>
is generated by run length coding. The bit map data has<br>
been coded using an MR or MMR coding, both of which are<br>
standard coding systems for level sliced image data By<br>
using such coded display data, redundancy of information<br>
can be efficiently reduced. Thus, a limited recording<br><br>
capacity in the recording medium can be effectively used.<br>
Such effective use of the recording capacity increases,<br>
for example, available recording time, data amount allo-<br>
cated for audio data, and types of recordable display<br>
data. The bit map data can be coded using any run length<br>
coding system in lieu of the MR or MMR coding. In the<br>
recording medium in the third example, data format<br>
identification information 138 is not required.<br>
The recording medium in the third example can<br>
additionally have a start code for identifying the start<br>
of each type of display data 152 in the display data<br>
group 135. In this case, one type of the display data<br>
152 can be selected without the data length 139 repre-<br>
senting the length of the following bit map data 140.<br>
In the first through third examples, the audio<br>
data can be compression-coded or non-compression-coded.<br>
There is no specific limitation regarding the coding<br>
system.<br>
An optical disk can be used as the recording<br>
medium, but the recording medium according to the present<br>
invention is not limited to an optical disk.<br>
When an optical disk is used as the recording<br>
medium, the optical disk can have a thickness of 0.6 mm,<br>
but a recording medium according to the present invention<br>
can have an arbitrary thickness.<br>
An optical disk used as the recording medium can<br>
be a one-sided optical disk which allows data to be<br>
recorded on one side or a two-sided optical disk which<br><br>
allows data to be recorded on two sides. Alternatively,<br>
an optical disk allowing data to be recorded in a plural-<br>
ity of layers can be used.<br>
Data to be recorded to the recording medium can<br>
include video data or any other type of data.<br>
Reproduction apparatus&gt;<br>
Hereinafter, a reproduction apparatus according<br>
to the present invention will now be described with<br>
reference to Figures 2 through 8.<br>
(Reproduction apparatus: example 1)<br>
Figure 2 shows a structure of a first example of<br>
a reproduction apparatus according to the present inven-<br>
tion. The reproduction apparatus in the first example<br>
(Figure 2) reproduces audio data and display data stored<br>
in an optical disk 201. The optical disk 201 is a<br>
recording medium according to the present invention,<br>
which has the structure shown in Figure 1.<br>
The operation of the reproduction apparatus in<br>
the first example (Figure 2) will now be described.<br>
Data recorded to the optical disk 201 is read by<br>
a reading head 202. A reproduction signal processor 203<br>
demodulates the read data and performs error correction.<br>
The data processed by the reproduction signal processor<br>
203 is first accumulated in a memory 204. The memory 204<br>
is used for stabilizing the effective speed of data<br>
transfer to improve the data transfer efficiency. The<br>
data accumulated in the memory 204 are sequentially input<br>
to a demultiplexer 205.<br><br>
The demultiplexer 205 identifies audio data and<br>
display data included in the recorded data and outputs<br>
the audio data and the display data separately. As<br>
described above, the optical disk 201 stores data as<br>
shown in Figure 1. The demultiplexer 205 identifies the<br>
identification code described in the header 132 of each<br>
of the plurality of audio data packs 125 and the identi-<br>
fication code described in the header 134 of the display<br>
data pack 123 to separate the audio data and the display<br>
data from each other. The audio data packs 125 separated<br>
from the display data packs 123 by the demultiplexer 205<br>
are input to an audio data selector 207. The display<br>
data pack 123 separated from the audio data pack 125 by<br>
the demultiplexer 205 is input to an display data selec-<br>
tor 206.<br>
The audio data selector 207 selectively outputs<br>
one audio data pack 125 out of the plurality of types of<br>
audio data packs 125 in accordance with a control signal<br>
generated by a first external control signal generator<br>
212. For example, when the audio data packs 125 corre-<br>
sponding to a plurality of languages such as Japanese,<br>
English, French and German are stored as shown in Figure<br>
1, the audio data selector 207 selectively outputs the<br>
audio data pack 125 corresponding to one specific lan-<br>
guage (for example, English) out of the plurality of<br>
languages.<br>
The audio data selector 207 identifies the types<br>
of the audio data packs 125 by referring to the identifi-<br>
cation code stored in the header 132 of each audio data<br>
pack 125 to selectively output the audio data pack 125 of<br>
a specific type.<br><br>
The selection of the audio data pack 125 can be<br>
performed by any appropriate method. For example, the<br>
user can input a command representing the type of the<br>
desired audio data pack 125 from outside the reproduction<br>
apparatus so that the audio data pack 125 of the type<br>
corresponding to the command can be selected. Alterna-<br>
tively, the type of the audio data pack 125 to be select-<br>
ed can be fixed in advance.<br>
The audio data pack 125 selected by the audio<br>
data selector 207 is reproduced by an audio reproducer<br>
208 and output by a speaker 210.<br>
The display data selector 206 selectively outputs<br>
one type of display data 152 out of the plurality of<br>
types of display data 152 included in the display data<br>
group 135 in accordance with a control signal generated<br>
by a second external control signal generator 213. For<br>
example, when the plurality of types of display data 152<br>
corresponding to a plurality of languages such as Japa-<br>
nese, English, French and German are stored as shown in<br>
Figure 1, the display data selector 206 selectively<br>
outputs one type of display data 152 corresponding to one<br>
specific language (for example, English) out of the<br>
plurality of types of display data 152.<br>
The display data selector 206 identifies the<br>
types of display data 152 by referring to the identifica-<br>
tion code 137 stored in each type of the display data 152<br>
and selectively outputs the bit map data 140 correspond-<br>
ing to the selected display data 152.<br>
The selection of the display data 152 can be per-<br><br>
formed by any appropriate method. For example, the user<br>
can input a command representing the desired type of<br>
display data 152 from outside the reproduction apparatus<br>
so that the display data 152 of the type corresponding to<br>
the command can be selected. Alternatively, the type of<br>
the display data 152 to be selected can be fixed in<br>
advance.<br>
The bit map data 140 corresponding to the desired<br>
type of display data 152 selected by the display data<br>
selector 206 is processed by a bit map display processor<br>
209 and displayed by a liquid crystal display 211.<br>
In the reproduction apparatus in the first<br>
example (Figure 2), a specific type of display data 152<br>
can be selectively displayed from a recording medium<br>
storing a plurality of types of display data 152. For<br>
example, when a plurality of types of display data 152<br>
corresponding to a plurality of languages are stored in<br>
the optical disk, the type of display data 152 specified<br>
by a control signal generated by a second external<br>
control signal generator 213 is selectively displayed.<br>
Thus, software corresponding to a plurality of languages<br>
can be processed by one reproduction apparatus.<br>
In the case where character data is recorded into<br>
a recording medium using a prescribed character code, the<br>
character data can be recorded at a high compression<br>
ratio. However, in order to process software correspond-<br>
ing to a plurality of languages, a reproduction apparatus<br>
needs to have a ROM for storing a plurality of look-up<br>
tables respectively corresponding to the plurality of<br>
languages. Storing a plurality of look-up tables enlarg-<br><br>
es the hardware and thus increases the production cost.<br>
If a reproduction apparatus is provided for each of the<br>
plurality of languages, reproduction apparatuses of<br>
different types need to be produced separately. This<br>
raises the production cost and requires complicated and<br>
troublesome supply and management procedures.<br>
By contrast, a recording medium according to the<br><br>
present invention can store bit map data in lieu of<br>
character data as display data. A reproduction apparatus<br>
according to the present invention selectively reproduces<br>
bit map data corresponding to a specific language out of<br>
bit map data stored in the recording medium corresponding<br>
to a plurality of languages. According to the present<br>
invention, a significant benefit can be obtained in that<br>
one reproduction apparatus which can support a plurality<br>
of languages without enlarging the hardware is produced<br>
and supplied.<br>
Since the bit map data is used as display data,<br>
graphic patterns such as sheet music of music software<br>
can be displayed relatively easily as well as character<br>
data. Thus, the reproduction apparatus according to the.<br>
present invention can provide a high quality user inter- face.	<br>
(Reproduction apparatus: example 2)<br>
Figure 3 shows a structure of a second example of<br>
a reproduction apparatus according to the present inven-<br>
tion. In the reproduction apparatus in the second<br>
example (Figure 3), a prescribed type of audio data pack<br>
125 is selected by the audio data selector 207, and a<br>
prescribed type of display data 152 is selected by the<br><br>
display data selector 206 as in the reproduction appara-<br>
tus in the first example (Figure 2). The reproduction<br>
apparatus in the second example (Figure 3) is different<br>
from the reproduction apparatus in the first example<br>
(Figure 2) in including a reference clock generator 302<br>
and a phase controller 301.<br>
The phase controller 301 controls an audio repro-<br>
ducer 308 for reproducing the selected audio data pack<br>
125 and a bit map display processor 309 for displaying<br>
the selected display data 152. Thus, the phase control-<br>
ler 301 controls the reproduction time of the audio data<br>
and the reproduction time of the display data in accor-<br>
dance with a reference clock generated by the reference<br>
clock generator 302.<br>
In other words, the phase controller 301 controls<br>
the audio reproducer 308 and the bit map display proces-<br>
sor 309 so that the display data is displayed in the same<br>
time period in which the audio data is reproduced. For<br>
example, when the audio data pack 125 is 0.5 second long,<br>
the phase controller 301 controls the bit map display<br>
processor 309 so that the display data 152 corresponding<br>
to the selected audio data pack 125 is displayed for 0.5<br>
second. Furthermore, the phase controller 301 controls<br>
the audio reproducer 308 and the bit map display proces-<br>
sor 309 so that when the audio reproducer 308 starts<br>
reproducing the subseguent audio data pack 125, the bit<br>
map display processor 309 simultaneously starts display-<br>
ing the subseguent display data 152 corresponding to the<br>
above-mentioned subsequent audio data pack 125.<br>
By reproducing the audio data and the display<br><br>
data synchronously with each other, the display data can<br>
be displayed as a moving picture. For example, data<br>
representing lyrics or sheet music of a tune can be<br>
displayed along with the tune represented by the audio<br>
data. Thus, the reproduction apparatus in the second<br>
example (Figure 3) provides a high quality user inter-<br>
face.<br>
(Reproduction apparatus: example 3)<br>
Figure 4 shows a structure of a third example of<br>
a reproduction apparatus according to the present inven-<br>
tion. In the reproduction apparatus in the third example<br>
(Figure 4), a prescribed type of audio data pack 125 is<br>
selected by the audio data selector 207, and a prescribed<br>
type of display data 152 is selected by the display data<br>
selector 206 as in the reproduction apparatus in the<br>
first example (Figure 2). The reproduction apparatus in<br>
the third example (Figure 4) is different from the repro-<br>
duction apparatus in the first example (Figure 2) in that<br>
the bit map data 140 included in the selected display<br>
data 152 is decoded using run length decoding.<br>
A run length decoder 401 decodes the bit map data<br>
140 included in the display data 152 coded by run length<br>
coding. A memory 402 accumulates the decoded bit map<br>
data 140 therein. A driver 403 drives the liquid crystal<br>
display 211 based on the information accumulated in the<br>
memory 402 to display the display data 152.<br>
In the reproduction apparatus in the third<br>
example (Figure 4), display data efficiently coded by run<br>
length coding can be decoded to be displayed. Such a<br>
reproduction apparatus can reproduce data efficiently<br><br>
stored in a recording medium having a limited memory<br>
capacity.<br>
Any appropriate system can be used for run length<br>
coding. For example, MR or MMR system can be used, both<br>
of which are standard systems for level-sliced image<br>
data.<br>
(Reproduction apparatus: example 4)<br>
Figure 5 shows a structure of a fourth example of<br>
a reproduction apparatus according to the present inven-<br>
tion. In the reproduction apparatus in the fourth<br>
example (Figure 5), the bit map data 140 of the desired<br>
display data 152 is decoded by the run length decoder 401<br>
as in the reproduction apparatus in the third example<br>
(Figure 4). The reproduction apparatus in the fourth<br>
example (Figure 5). is different from the reproduction<br>
apparatus in the third example (Figure 4) in including a<br>
reference clock generator 502 and a phase controller 501.<br>
The phase controller 501 controls an audio<br>
reproducer 508 for reproducing the selected audio data<br>
pack 125 and a driver 503 for displaying the selected<br>
display data 152. Thus, the phase controller 501 con-<br>
trols the reproduction time of the audio data and the<br>
reproduction time of the display data in accordance with<br>
a reference clock generated by the reference clock<br>
generator 502.<br>
In other words, the phase controller 501 controls<br>
the audio reproducer 508 and the driver 503 so that the<br>
display data is displayed in the same time period in<br>
which the audio data is reproduced. For example, when<br><br>
the audio data pack 125 is 0.5 second long, the phase<br>
controller 501 controls the driver 503 so that the<br>
display data 152 corresponding to the selected audio data<br>
pack 125 is displayed for 0.5 second. Furthermore, the<br>
phase controller 501 controls the audio reproducer 508<br>
and the driver 503 so that when the audio reproducer 508<br>
starts reproducing the subsequent audio data pack 125,<br>
the driver 503 simultaneously starts displaying the<br>
following display data 152 corresponding to the above-<br>
mentioned subsequent audio data pack 125.<br>
By reproducing the audio data and the display<br>
data synchronously with each other, the display data can<br>
be displayed as a moving picture. For example, data<br>
representing lyrics or sheet music of a tune can be<br>
displayed along with the tune represented by the audio<br>
data. Thus, the reproduction apparatus in the fourth<br>
example (Figure 5) provides a high quality user inter-<br>
face.<br>
(Reproduction apparatus: example 5)<br>
Figure 6 shows a structure of a fifth example of<br>
a reproduction apparatus according to the present inven-<br>
tion. In the reproduction apparatus in the fifth example<br>
(Figure 6), the bit map data 140 of a prescribed type of<br>
display data 152 is decoded by the run length decoder 401<br>
as in the reproduction apparatus in the third example<br>
(Figure 4). The reproduction apparatus in the fifth<br>
example (Figure 6) is different from the reproduction<br>
apparatus in the third example (Figure 4) in that a<br>
second external control signal generator 601 operates in<br>
a different manner from the second external signal<br>
generator 213.<br><br>
The second external control signal generator 601<br>
outputs a second external control signal, which depends<br>
on a first external control signal output by the first<br>
external control signal generator 212 for selecting the<br>
audio data.<br>
For example, when the first external control<br>
signal generator 212 outputs a first external control<br>
signal which instructs the audio data selector 207 to<br>
select English audio data, the second external control<br>
signal generator 601 outputs a second external control<br>
signal which instructs the display data selector 206 to<br>
select display data representing an English character<br>
string.<br>
In the reproduction apparatus in the fifth<br>
example (Figure 6), the display data depending on the<br>
selected audio data can be selectively displayed. For<br>
example, when audio data representing an English song is<br>
selected, display data representing an English character<br>
string can be displayed. Thus, software corresponding to<br>
a plurality of languages can be processed by one<br>
reproduction apparatus.<br>
The second external control signal generator 601<br>
can output a second external control signal in accordance<br>
with a command which is input from outside the reproduc-<br>
tion apparatus in the fifth example (Figure 6). For<br>
example, the second external control signal generator 601<br>
can be set so that display data corresponding to the<br>
audio data is automatically selected to be displayed<br>
unless the user inputs a command, and so that when the<br>
user inputs a command, a specific type of display data<br><br>
corresponding to the command is selectively displayed.<br>
Thus, the reproduction apparatus in the fifth example<br>
(Figure 6) provides a high quality user interface.<br>
(Reproduction apparatus: example 6)<br>
Figure 7 shows a structure of a sixth example of<br>
a reproduction apparatus according to the present inven-<br>
tion. In the reproduction apparatus in the sixth example<br>
(Figure 7), the bit map data 140 of a prescribed type of<br>
desired display data 152 is decoded by the run length<br>
decoder 401, and the reproduction time for the audio data<br>
and the reproduction time for the display data are<br>
controlled by the phase controller 501 as in the<br>
reproduction apparatus in the fourth example (Figure 5).<br>
The reproduction apparatus in the sixth example (Figure<br>
7) is different from the reproduction apparatus in the<br>
fourth example (Figure 5) in that a second external<br>
control signal generator 601 operates in a different<br>
manner from the second external signal generator 213.<br>
The second external control signal generator 601<br>
outputs a second external control signal, which depends<br>
on a first external control signal output by the first<br>
external control signal generator 212 for selecting the<br>
audio data.<br>
For example, when the first external control<br>
signal generator 212 outputs a first external control<br>
signal which instructs the audio data selector 207 to<br>
select English audio data, the second external control<br>
signal generator 601 outputs a second external control<br>
signal which instructs the display data selector 206 to<br>
select display data representing an English character<br><br>
string.<br>
In the reproduction apparatus in the sixth<br>
example (Figure 7), the display data depending on the<br>
selected audio data can be selectively displayed. For<br>
example, when audio data representing an English song is<br>
selected, display data representing an English character<br>
string can be displayed. Thus, software corresponding to<br>
a plurality of languages can be processed by one<br>
reproduction apparatus.<br>
By reproducing the audio data and the display<br>
data synchronously with each other, the display data can<br>
be displayed as a moving picture. For example, data<br>
representing lyrics or sheet music of a tune can be<br>
displayed along with the tune represented by the audio<br>
data. Thus, the reproduction apparatus in the sixth<br>
example (Figure 7) provides a high quality user inter-<br>
face.<br>
The second external control signal generator 601<br>
can output a second external control signal in accordance<br>
with a command which is input from outside the reproduc-<br>
tion apparatus in the sixth example (Figure 7). For<br>
example, the second external control signal generator 601<br>
can be set so that display data corresponding to the<br>
audio data is automatically selected to be displayed<br>
unless the user inputs a command, and so that when the<br>
user inputs a command, a specific type of display data<br>
corresponding to the command is selectively displayed.<br>
Thus, the reproduction apparatus in the sixth example<br>
(Figure 7) provides a higher quality user interface.<br><br>
(Reproduction apparatus: example 7)<br>
Figure 8 shows a structure of a seventh example<br>
of a reproduction apparatus according to the present<br>
invention. The reproduction apparatus in the seventh<br>
example (Figure 8) reproduces audio data and display data<br>
stored in an optical disk 801. The optical disk 801 is<br>
a recording medium according to the present invention,<br>
which has the structure shown in Figure 1.<br>
The operation of the reproduction apparatus in<br>
the seventh example (Figure 8) will be described with<br>
reference to Figures 1 and 8.<br>
A system controller 825 is provided for control-<br>
ling each of a plurality of sections in the reproduction<br>
apparatus shown in Figure 8. The system controller 825<br>
outputs a control signal for controlling each section of<br>
the reproduction apparatus in accordance with an external<br>
control signal input by the user and control information<br>
stored in the optical disk 801.<br>
Data recorded to the optical disk 801 is read by<br>
a reading head 802. The reading head 802 reads data in<br>
accordance with an actuator 803 which is controlled by<br>
the system controller 825. The read data is demodulated<br>
and treated with error correction by a reproduction<br>
signal processor 804. A data divider 805 divides the<br>
data output from the reproduction signal processor 804<br>
into the volume information 102, the management informa-<br>
tion file 104, and data files 120 in accordance with an<br>
instruction from the system controller 825. The volume<br>
information 102 is input to a volume information proces-<br>
sor 808. The management information file 104 is input to<br><br>
a management information file processor 807. Each data<br>
file 120 is input to a buffer memory 806.<br>
When reproduction of the optical disk 801 starts,<br>
the volume information 102 is first identified by the<br>
volume information processor 808. Then, based on the<br>
volume information 102 identified, an address in the<br>
optical disk 801 at which the management information file<br>
104 is recorded is specified.<br>
The system controller 825 controls the actuator<br>
803 to read the management information file 104 recorded<br>
in the specified address. The management information<br>
file 104 read by the actuator 803 is analyzed by the<br>
management information file processor 807. By this<br>
analysis, the titles stored in the optical disk 801,<br>
reproduction time, the number of types of audio data,<br>
whether display data is stored or not, the types of<br>
display data, and the like are identified. Such<br>
information is provided to the user. For example, such<br>
information is displayed on a liquid crystal display 820.<br>
The liquid crystal display 820 is controlled by the<br>
overall control signal output from the system controller<br>
825.<br>
Referring to such information, a request for<br>
selecting a desired type of audio data and display data<br>
is input to the reproduction apparatus by, for example,<br>
the user. Then, the request is supplied to the system<br>
controller 825 as an external control signal.<br>
The system controller 825 drives an audio data<br>
selection control signal generator 814 for generating a<br><br>
control signal for selecting audio data and also drives<br>
a display data selection control signal generator 815 for<br>
generating a control signal for selecting display data.<br>
Selection of audio data and display data will be de-<br>
scribed later.<br>
When an external control signal is not generated<br>
by the user or the like, audio data and display data can<br>
be selected based on a prescribed initial condition.<br>
The external control signal includes information<br>
which specifies the title to be reproduced. Such infor-<br>
mation is identified by the system controller 825. Then,<br>
the system controller 825 controls the actuator 803 to<br>
read the data file 120 storing the title specified by the<br>
external control signal from the optical disk 801. The<br>
read data file 120 is accumulated in the buffer memory<br>
806.<br>
The system controller 825 monitors the amount of<br>
data occupying the buffer memory 806 and controls data<br>
reading so as to avoid underflow or overflow of the<br>
buffer memory 806. By using the buffer memory 806 in<br>
this manner, the effective speed of data transfer can be<br>
stabilized and the data transfer efficiency can be<br>
improved.<br>
The data file 120 accumulated by the buffer<br>
memory 806 is input to a pack analyzer 809. The pack<br>
analyzer 809 analyzes the recording unit 121 included in<br>
the data file 120 to divide the recording unit 121 into<br>
the reproduction control pack 122, the display data pack<br>
123, and the audio data pack group 124. Each pack or the<br><br>
pack group is analyzed by identifying the start of the<br>
pack with the start code included in the header of the<br>
pack and analyzing the rest of the information stored in<br>
the header. The recording unit 121 is divided into the<br>
packs 122, 123 and 124 by identifying the identification<br>
code stored in the header of each pack or the pack group.<br>
The reproduction time information 150 stored in the<br>
header 132 of each audio data pack 125 and reproduction<br>
time information 151 stored in the header 134 of the<br>
display data pack 123 are input to a phase controller<br>
823.<br>
The reproduction control pack 122 separated from<br>
the rest of the recording unit 121 is input to a<br>
reproduction control analyzer 810. The reproduction<br>
control analyzer 810 reads the system information,<br>
reproduction control information, and data retrieval<br>
information described in the reproduction control pack<br>
122. Such information is input to the system controller<br>
825. The system controller 825 controls reproduction, by<br>
referring to such information.<br>
The audio data pack group 124 is input to an<br>
audio data selector 811. The audio data selector 811<br>
selectively outputs a prescribed audio data pack 125 out<br>
of the plurality of audio data packs 125 included in the<br>
audio data pack group 124 in accordance with a control<br>
signal output from an audio data selection control signal<br>
generator 814. The prescribed audio data pack 125 is<br>
identified by referring to an audio data identification<br>
code described in the header 130. For example, when<br>
reproduction of Japanese audio data is requested, the<br>
audio data pack 125 storing the Japanese audio data is<br><br>
identified by referring to the audio data identification<br>
code, and the identified audio data pack 125 is selec-<br>
tively output.<br>
The audio data pack 125 selectively output is<br>
reproduced by an audio reproducer 821 and is output to a<br>
speaker 822 as an audio signal. The audio reproducer 821<br>
identifies the data format of the audio data stream 133<br>
by referring to data format identification information<br>
stored in the header 130 of the audio data pack 125, and<br>
reproduces the audio data in accordance with the data<br>
format. Thus, data coded with one of a plurality of<br>
coding systems such as the linear PCM, MPEG audio, or AC3<br>
systems can be reproduced by one audio reproducer 821.<br>
The display data pack 123 separated from the rest<br>
of the recording unit 121 is input to a display data<br>
analyzer 813 and also to a display data selector 812.<br>
The display data analyzer 813 analyzes the identification<br>
code 137, the data format identification information 138<br>
and the data length 139 of each of a plurality of types<br>
of display data 152 of the display data group 135 includ-<br>
ed in the display data pack 123. Thus, the types of the<br>
display data such as Japanese character data, English<br>
character data, and musical note data are identified.<br>
Also, the data format which indicates whether the bit map<br>
data of each type of display data has been compression-<br>
coded by using run length coding or non-compression-coded<br>
is identified.<br>
The display data selector 812 selectively outputs<br>
a desired type of display data 152 based on an analysis<br>
result of the , display data analyzer 813 and a control<br><br>
signal generated by the display data selection control<br>
signal generator 815. The display data analyzer 813<br>
controls a switch 816 in accordance with the analysis<br>
result. When the display data 152 has been run-length-<br>
coded, the switch 816 is controlled to cause the display<br>
data 152 to be input to a run length decoder 817. The<br>
display data 152 which has been run-length-coded is<br>
decoded by the run length decoder 817. The bit map data<br>
140 of the decoded display data 152 is accumulated in a<br>
memory 818. When the bit map data 140 of the display<br>
data 152 has been non-compression-coded, the switch 816<br>
is controlled to cause the display data 152 to be input<br>
to the memory 818 and bypass the run length decoder 817.<br>
The bit map data 140 of the display data 152<br>
accumulated in the memory 818 is input to a driver 819.<br>
The driver 819 drives the liquid crystal display 820 so<br>
that the bit map data 140 is displayed by the liquid<br>
crystal display 820.<br>
The audio reproducer 821 and the driver 819 are<br>
controlled by the phase controller 823. The phase<br>
controller 823 controls the reproduction time for the<br>
audio data and the reproduction time for the display data<br>
in accordance with the reproduction time information 150<br>
in the audio data pack 125, the reproduction time infor-<br>
mation 151 of the display data pack 123, and a reference<br>
clock generated by a reference clock generator 824. In<br>
other words, the phase controller 823 controls the audio<br>
reproducer 821 and the driver 819 so that the reproduc-<br>
tion time for the audio data and the reproduction time<br>
for the display data, corresponding to the audio data,<br>
match.<br><br>
The audio data and the display data are synchro-<br>
nized by adjusting the reproduction time for the display<br>
data so as to be synchronized with the reproduction time<br>
for the audio data. The reproduction time for the<br>
display data is adjusted by using the memory 818.<br>
The display data can be characters or simple<br>
graphic information such as musical notes. The charac-<br>
ters and the graphic information are displayed in a<br>
liquid crystal display. Accordingly, the amount of the<br>
display data is smaller than that of the audio data. The<br>
display data can be displayed by a simpler process than<br>
reproduction of the audio data. The display data can be<br>
transferred and also processed in a shorter period of<br>
time than the display data, thereby allowing the repro- duction time for the display data to be adjusted in rela-<br>
tion to the reproduction time for the audio data. As a<br>
result, the audio data and the display data can be<br>
synchronized with each other.<br>
Since the amount of the display data is smaller<br>
than that of the audio data as described above, the size<br>
of the buffer memory 818 which is required for adjusting<br>
the reproduction time for the display data can be smaller<br>
than the size of the buffer memory which is required for<br>
adjusting the reproduction time for the audio data.<br>
Accordingly, the production cost of the reproduction<br>
apparatus in the seventh example (Figure 8) can be re-<br>
duced.<br>
By reproducing the audio data and the display<br>
data synchronously with each other, the display data can<br>
be displayed as a moving picture. For example, data<br><br>
representing lyrics or sheet music of a tune can be<br>
displayed along with the tune represented by the audio<br>
data. Thus, the reproduction apparatus in the seventh<br>
example (Figure 8) provides a high quality user inter-<br>
face.<br>
In the above-described reproduction apparatuses<br>
according to the present invention, the optical disks 201<br>
and 801 can be replaced with an arbitrary recording<br>
medium. The present invention is not limited to any<br>
specific type of recording medium.<br>
The optical disks 201 and 801 can each have a<br>
thickness of 0.6 mm, but a recording medium according to<br>
the present invention can have an arbitrary thickness.<br>
An optical disk used as the recording medium can<br>
be a one-sided optical disk which allows data to be<br>
recorded on one side or a two-sided optical disk which<br>
allows data to be recorded on two sides. Alternatively,<br>
an optical disk allowing data to be recorded in a plural-<br>
ity of layers can be used.<br>
The reproduction apparatus can include a single<br>
reading head 202 or a plurality of reading heads 202.<br>
When a plurality of reading heads 202 are provided, the<br>
data can be read in parallel. <br>
The reproduction apparatus can be a recording and<br>
reproduction apparatus additionally having a function of<br>
recording data onto the recording medium.<br>
The audio data can be compression-coded or non-<br><br>
compression-coded. Regarding the compression coding<br>
system, there is no specific limitation.<br>
The liquid crystal displays 211 and 820 can be<br>
replaced with an arbitrary display which can display bit<br>
map data. The present invention is not limited to any<br>
specific type of display.<br>
The data to be recorded in the recording medium<br>
can include video data or any other type of data.<br>
By a recording medium and a reproduction appara-<br>
tus according to the present invention, display data can<br>
be displayed synchronously with the audio data<br>
corresponding to the display data, based on information<br>
on reproduction time for the audio data and information<br>
on reproduction time for the display data. For example,<br>
lyrics or sheet music of a tune can be displayed along<br>
the tune represented by the audio data. As appreciated<br>
from this, a reproduction apparatus according to the<br>
present invention provides a high quality user interface.<br>
Furthermore, when a recording medium and a<br>
reproduction apparatus according to the present invention<br>
are used, one of a plurality of types of audio data can<br>
be selectively reproduced, and one of a plurality of<br>
types of display data can be selectively displayed. By<br>
this function, for example, an English character string<br>
can be displayed while music software in English is<br>
reproduced, and a Japanese character string can be<br>
displayed while music software in Japanese is reproduced.<br>
Thus, software corresponding to a plurality of languages<br>
can be processed by one reproduction apparatus.<br><br>
From the viewpoint of software producers, such a<br>
common recording medium has a significant effect of<br>
eliminating a complicated procedure of producing, supply-<br>
ing and managing software in correspondence with each of<br>
a plurality of languages and of allowing them to produce,<br>
supply and manage software common for the plurality of<br>
languages more efficiently. From the viewpoint of users,<br>
such a common recording medium, which allows them to<br>
select any of the plurality of languages, is easier to<br>
use.<br>
Moreover, a recording medium and a reproduction<br>
apparatus according to the present invention use bit map<br>
data as display data. Since a ROM for storing a look-up<br>
table, which is required when a character code is used,<br>
can be eliminated, the scale of the circuitry of the<br>
reproduction apparatus can be smaller. A smaller size of<br>
the circuitry becomes more advantageous as the reproduc-<br>
tion apparatus supports more languages. The use of bit<br>
map data provides another advantage that data represent-<br>
ing logos or musical notes, which cannot be represented<br>
by a character code, can be displayed.<br>
Various other modifications will be apparent to<br>
and can be readily made by those skilled in the art<br>
without departing from the scope and spirit of this<br>
invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the<br>
scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the<br>
