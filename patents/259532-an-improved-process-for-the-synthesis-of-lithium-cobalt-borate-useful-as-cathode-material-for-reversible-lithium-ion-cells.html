				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for preparation of lithium cobalt borate by thermal method which is a useful cathode material for secondary nonaqueous solid-state &amp; polymer electrolyte cells<br>
This invention particularly relates to the preparation of lithium cobalt borate (L1CO0. 5 Bo0 5 O2) a composite, which is very useful for high voltage lithium reversible cells and can be prepared by mixing oxides of cobalt, boron with lithium carbonate / LiOH by heating together all in solid state condition, (L1CO0. 5 N1o0 5 O2) is a reversible cathode material useful for high voltage cells of lithium in non-aqueous media<br>
L1C01 y ByO2 compound is hexagonal material is well known from 2000 as a good battery cathode for reversibility in non-aqueous solutions This compound can be prepared by heating LiOH with CoO / C03O4 &amp; B for long duration (&gt;24 hrs) and high temperature calcinations (&gt;750°C) under flow of oxygen [Solid State Ionics Devices, Edited by S Selladurai et al p 159-168,2000] This product can be used as a cathode material for secondary nonaqueous, solid state &amp; polymer electrolyte cells<br>
In the above procedure available in the literature some disadvantages were observed They are as follows -<br>
1	Phase purity and particle size<br>
2	Longer duration of thermal preparation<br>
3	High temperature of operation<br>
The main object of this invention is to synthesize (L1CO0. 5 Bo0 5 O2) under suitable<br>
solid state reaction method which obviates the defects and draw backs hither to<br>
known in other methods of preparation of this compound from already known<br>
procedures in literatures<br>
Another object of this present invention is to formulate a new procedure for the<br>
synthesis of an improved process for the synthesis of lithium cobalt borate useful as<br>
cathode material for reversible lithium ion cells which obviates the draw backs of the<br>
known methods<br>
Further object of this invention is the cyclabihty of the system by retaining cobalt<br>
with the cathode material and replacing partially by boron<br>
Still another object is to use glycerol as a binding agent to make as uniform<br>
homogeneous mixture which permits uniform reaction to occur without any side<br>
reaction<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to prepare L1C01/2 B1/2 B1/2 02 with oxides and<br>
carbonate of the components present in the product<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the synthesis of lithium<br>
cobalt borate useful as cathode material for reversible lithium ion cells which<br>
comprises preparing a paste by mixing lithium source with oxides of boron &amp; cobalt<br>
in a ratio 10 5 0 5 respectively, heating the paste prepared above at a temperature<br>
upto 800°C for a period upto 12 hours, followed by cooling to give lithium cobalt<br>
borate (LiCo0 5B0 5O2)<br>
In the embodiment of the invention glycerol is used as a binding agent for making<br>
paste<br>
In another embodiment of the invention heating may be affected at a temperature in the range of 200-750°C<br>
Lithium source may be selected from LiOHLiCO3<br>
A novel method of preparing this compound viz , L1C00.5 Bo 5 O4 was carried out by uniform mixing of oxides of Co and B with LiOH and this mixture was made into a paste by adding necessary quantity of glycerol and the paste was calcined at 750°C continuously for 12 hrs in a furnace The prepared   product  was   subjected to  x-ray    analysis    The product   was found to be in single phase<br>
The present invention, describes the method of synthesis of cathode material for a secondary battery, but heating a paste prepared by mixing fine particles of LiOH / L12CO3, C03O4 and B2O3 in glycerol This paste was initially heated slowly in a furnace to evaporate off glycerol in order to get a dried mass at 250°C This dried mass was then continuously heated to 750°C for 12 hrs The compound formed was slowly cooled to room temperature and was ground well and then examined for its particles size, colour and XRD exposure It was found that the prepared sample was black in colour and was homogenous X-ray analysis confirmed for formation of L1C00 5 Bo 5 O2 according to Fig 1<br>
1	L1B02 is being synthesized by a solid state reaction which as a new technique<br>
2	The product obtained is pure which is evidenced from the x-ray details<br>
3	The product does not undergo any side reactions or partial reaction is again evidenced from x-ray analysis<br>
4	This is a simple step process which does not need any purification as pure components of the reactants ensure product of high purity<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and should not be construed the scope of this invention<br>
Example - 1<br>
Oxides of boron, cobalt and carbonate of lithium were ground well in to a paste form with pestle &amp; mortar arrangement in glycerol The paste was carefully removed to a ceramic / silica crucible &amp; was slowly heated initially to 300°C till the paste becomes dry &amp; was findally heated to 800°C for 12 hours The reactant was slowly cooled to ambient temperature and was examined for confirmation of the product by x-ray analysis<br>
