DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided an emsulsifiable myco-chemical herbicide concentrate comprising 107 to 1014 spores/g or ml of Altemaria alternata, 10 to 50 % by weight of a phenyl-thio-pyrimidine of the Formula I<br><br><br>
Formula I wherein X is a halogen atom such as flouro, chloro, bromo or iodo and M is an  alkalimetal ion such as sodium or potassium, 15 to 50 % by weight  of surfactant(s) and 50 to 75 % by weight of water.<br>
The surfactants / dispersing agents used in the invention may be any known surfactant / dispersing agent including those reported in US Patent No 4932999. Ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated octyl phenol are preferred surfactants as they have low persistence in the environment and are environment friendly. Also they occur in nature and are easily available  and cheap.<br>
Preferably, the emulsifiable myco-chemical herbicide concentrate comprises 10 to 10 spores/g or ml of Alternaria alternata, 10 to 15 % by weight of a phenyl-thio-pyrimidine of the Formula I, 15 to 50 % by weight of the    surfactants  ethoxylated  lauryl  alcohol and  ethoxylated  octyl<br><br>
Still preferably, the emulsifiable myco-chemical herbicide concentrate comprises 25 % by weight of the surfactants ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated octyl  phenol in the weight ratio of 25 : 75 to 75 : 25.<br>
Preferably, the emulsifiable myco- chemical herbicide concentrate comprises sodium 2-chloro-6-[4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)thio] benzoate.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided a process for the preparation of an emsulsifiable myco-chemical herbicide concentrate comprising mixing under stirring at 26°C ± 2°C 107 to 1014 spores/g or ml of Alternaria alternate, 10 to 50 % by weight of a phenyl-thio-pyrimidine of the Formula I<br><br><br>
wherein X is a halogen atom such as flouro, chloro, bromo or iodo and M is an alkalimetal ion such as sodium or potassium, 15 to 50 % by weight of surfactant(s) and 50 to 75 % by weight of water.<br>
Preferably, the process comprises mixing 107 to 1011 spores/g or ml of Altemaria alternata, 10 to 15 % by weight of a phenyl-thio-pyrimidine of the Formula I, 15 to 50 % by weight of the surfactants ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated octyl phenol in the weight ratio of 10 : 90 - 90 : 10 and 50 to 75 % by weight   of water.<br>

According to the invention there is also provided a method of effectively controlling Trianthema portulacastrum weeds in crops especially   cotton<br><br>
crops by applying or spraying the emulsifiable myco-chemical herbicide concentrate described above.<br>
The herbicide concentrate of the invention is diluted with water in the volume ratio 1 : 400 to 1 : 1600 prior to applying or spraying on the Trianthema portulacastrum weeds.<br>
The following experimental examples are illustrative of the invention but are not limitative of the scope thereof:<br>
Example 1<br>
Five hundred ml spore suspension of Alternaria altemata (1011 spores / ml) was mixed with 31.25g sodium 2-chloro-6-[4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)thio] benzoate, 78.12g ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated octyl phenol (25% w/w) in the weight ratio 25 : 75 and 500 litres of water under stirring at 26+2°C to obtain a spray solution for one hectare area containing 108 spores/ ml of fungus Alternaria altemata, 0.00625% by weight of the sodium 2-chloro-6-[4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)thio]benzoate and 0.0156 % by weight of ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated octyl phenol.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Five hundred ml spore suspension of Alternaria alternata (1010 spores / ml) was mixed with 46.875g sodium 2-chloro-6-[4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)thio] benzoate, 117.18g ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated octyl phenol ( 25% w/w) in the weight ratio 75 : 25 and 500 litres of water under stirring at 26+2°C to obtain a spray solution for one hectare containing 107 spores/ ml of fungus Alternaria alternata, 0.0093% by weight of the sodium 2-chloro-6-[4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl )thio]benzoate and 0.0156 % by weight of ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and  ethoxylated  octyl phenol.<br>
Using the myco-chemical herbicide concentrates of Examples 1 and 2 comparative studies were carried out on 28 days old Trianthema portulacastrum weeds by spraying only once on one hectare of cotton crops divided into 8 equal zones. The results recorded after 20 days of      spraying      were      as      given   in   the      following      Table:<br><br>
TABLE<br><br>
SN	Treatments in 500 litres of spray solution / ha	Percentage of Mortality of Trianthema Plants	Percentage of loss in bio mass over control<br>
1	Spray    of aqueous suspension of Alternaria   alternata (108 spores/ml.) in zone 1	63.3	87.7<br>
2	Spray of aqueous suspension of Altemaria alternata (108 spores/ ml) followed by Pyrithiobac sodium (31.25 g/ha) after 4 days in zone 2	58.3	87.5<br>
3	Spray of Pyrithiobac sodium (31.25 g/ha) followed  by aqueous suspension of Altemaria alternata (10 spores/ml) after 4 days in zone<br>
3	17.8	86.2<br>
4	Spray of pyrithiobac   sodium (31.25 g/ha) in zone 4	20.7	77.2<br>
5	Spray of pyrithiobac sodium (62.5 g/ha) in zone 5	92.0	89.3<br>
6	Herbicide concentrate of Example 1 in zone 6	89.5	89.0<br>
7	Herbicide  concentrate of Example 2 injzone 7	88.7	88.9<br>
8	-Control (water spray)	0.0	0.0<br>
Pyrithiobac sodium is a commonly used cotton herbicide comprising sodium 2-chloro-6-[4-6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl} thio]benzoate.<br><br>
The data in the above Table clearly show that the herbicide concentrates of Examples 1 and 2 were very effective and their efficacy was comparable to that of Pyrithiobac sodium applied at the recommended dose of 62.5 g/ha (SN 6 and 7 and SN 5). When Alternaria altemata and Pyrithiobac sodium were alternated with the dosage of Pyrithiobac sodium reduced by half (31.25g/ha), the efficacy was considerably low (SN 2 and 3). Further the efficacy of Altemaria altemata and that of Pyrithiobac sodium at half the dosage when sprayed individually was also reduced  considerably (SN 1 and 4).<br>
The herbicide concentrate of the invention is economical in that it comprises Alternaria alternata which is naturally occurring and is inexpensive and in that at the application stage it requires reduced quantity of the expensive phenyl-thio pyrimidines and surfactants per hectare. Due to the reduced quantity of the surfactants, persistence of the surfactants in the environment is reduced thereby reducing environmental problems. The surfactants ethoxylated lauryl alchol and ethoxylated octyl phenol have low persistence in the environment as compared to the other surfactants and dispersing agents reported . Therefore, herbicide concentrate of the invention comprising ethoxylated    lauryl    alcohol and<br><br>
ethoxylated octyl phenyl has still low persistence in the environment and is further environment friendly. Ethoxylated lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated octyl phenol are also naturally occurring and easily available and cheap. Using the above surfactants in the herbicide concentrate of the invention, it can be made further economical. The process of the invention involves simple mixing of the ingredients and is therefore, simple,   easy and convenient to carry out.<br>
The  herbicide concentrates of Examples 1 and 2 was  stored  for  6 months and was found to be  quite stable  at the end of 6 months.<br><br>
