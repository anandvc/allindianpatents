A GPRS service control node (GSN) controls the operation of the packet data service on the network side.An outside intruder can interfere with GPRS communication over the air interface (Um). The intruder may interfere with communication by transmitting unauthorized copies of transmitted messages, or send false messages and interfere with communication integrity.In accordance with the invention, the reliability of GPRS communication is improved by modifying the frame (F) used on a GPRS connection so that possible extra copies of the frames can be revealed. This can be achieved e.g. by adding an extra information field (3) to the data portion (2) of a GPRS frame (F), the contents of the field being modified between two frames (F) transmitted over the air interface (Um). The contents of the extra information field (3) can be wholly or partially the identity of the frame (F) concerned, the TLLI used on the connection, the IMSI or MSISDN identity of the mobile station, or an identity formed by an algorithm generating pseudo-random numbers. According to a preferable embodiment of the invention, at least one second extra information field (4) is added to the data portion (2) of the frame (F), 5 the field being preferably formed by a different algorithm than the first extra information field (3).</td>

				<td>The invention relates to a method for data transmission between a transmitter<br>
and a receiver (MS  GSN) in a digital mobile communication system.<br>
Figure 1 shows the parts of a cellular mobile communication system essential to the invention. Mobile Stations MS communicate with Base Trans¬ceiver Stations BTS over the air interface Urn. The base stations are controlled by Base Station Controllers BSC associated with Mobile Switching Centres MSC. A subsystem administered by a base station controller BSC - including the base stations BTS controlled by it - is commonly called a Base Station Subsystem BSS. The interface between a centre MSC and a base station subsystem BSS is called the A-interface. The section of the A-interface on the side of the mobile services switching centre MSC is called a Network Subsys¬tem NSS. Correspondingly, the interface between a base station controller BSC and a base station BTS is called the Abis-interface. A mobile services switching centre MSC switches incoming and outgoing calls. It performs simi¬lar tasks as the centre of a public telephone network PSTN. Additionally, it performs tasks characteristic of mobile telecommunication only, such as sub¬scriber location administration, in co-operation with network subscriber regis¬ters (not separately shown in Figure 1).<br>
A typical radio connection used in digital mobile communication systems is circuit switched, i.e. the radio resources reserved for a subscriber are kept reserved for that connection duhng the whole call. General Packet Radio Service GPRS is a new service designed for digital mobile communica¬tion systems, such as the GSM system. The packet radio service has been described in the ETSl recommendation TC-TR-GSM 01.60. A packet-mode radio connection with effective utilization of radio resources can be offered to a user of a mobile station MS by means of the packet radio service. In a packet switched connection resources are reserved only when there is speech or data :o be transmitted. The speech or data is assembled into packets with a given ength. Such a packet having been transmitted over the air interface Um, and :he transmitting party having no immediately succeeding packets to be trans-nitted, the radio resource can be released to the use of other subscribers.<br>
In order to illustrate the description, but not to limit the invention, it s assumed that the system comprises a separate GPRS service control node, )r a GPRS Support Node GSN, which controls the operation of the packet<br><br>
data service on the network side. This control comprises e.g. mobile station Logon and Logoff, mobile station location updates, and routing of data packets to the right destination. As regards the present application, the term "data", widely interpreted, refers to any information exchanged in a digital mobile communication system, such as speech coded in digital form, data transmis¬sion between computers, or telefax data. A GSN node can be situated in con¬nection with a base station BTS, a base station controller BSC or a mobile services switching centre MSC, or apart from these. The interface between a GSN node and a base station controller BSC is called the Gb-interface.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 and 2, information, such as control signalling and user data, is exchanged between a mobile station and a GSN node by means of GPRS frames. Each Frame F comprises at least a header 1 and a data portion 2. In order for the system to know which mobile station has transmitted the frame, the header 1 comprises an identifier for the mobile sta¬tion, e.g. a Temporary Logical Link Identity TLLI. At the beginning of a con¬nection, the GSN node assigns to a mobile station a TLLI to be used during a GPRS connection. After the GPRS connection, the same TLLI can be reas¬signed to another mobile station.<br>
In addition to a TLLI, a Network Layer Service access point Identity NLSI can also be used in the header 1 to indicate the application protocol used by the mobile station.<br>
The data portion 2 comprises confidential information, e.g. user data or control messages. This kind of information has to be protected in order to prevent data transfer to third parties in a comprehensible form. The data portion 2 can be coded, i.e. encrypted by an encryption key, known only to the transmitter and the receiver of the message. Since mobile stations use divided resources instead of connection-specific radio resources, the header 1 cannot be similarly protected. If the headers were protected by encryption, each re¬ceiver would have to open the headers of all messages transmitted over the air interface Um. Only then could a mobile station MS know to which mobile station the message was intended, or a GSN node could know which mobile station MS transmitted the message. The GSN node does not necessarily know which encryption key to use.<br>
As the header of a frame cannot be protected, the above prior art packet-mode data transmission involves certain security problems. Hence a third party, such as an intruder or an eavesdropper can interfere with GPRS<br><br>
communication over the air interface Um. In the present application such a person or device is referred to as an intruder. This term covers all kinds of un¬authorized interference with communication over the air interface irrespective of whether the purpose of the interference is eavesdropping, disturbing com¬munications, or any other unexceptional operation, e.g. an attempt to garble charging data. Even if the intruder is unable to unravel the contents of the message, (s)he may cause disturbance by using a TLLI intercepted from the air interface. The intruder may e.g. interfere with GPRS communication by transmitting unauthorized copies of messages transmitted via a GPRS con¬nection, or send false messages and interfere with communication integrity. A typical control message is quite short and even if the intruder does not know the encryption key, (s)he may try to find it out by a large-scale attack.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method for preventing the above possibility to interfere with GPRS communication and for improving communication reliability. The objects of the invention are achieved with a method which is characterized by what is disclosed in the characterizing part of claim 1. The preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention is based on improving the reliability of GPRS com¬munication by modifying a frame used on a GPRS connection so that frames sent by an intruder can be identified. This can be achieved e.g. by adding an extra information field to the data portion of a GPRS frame, the contents of the field being known only to the transmitter and the receiver of the message. In the present application the term "an extra information field" refers to a field added to the data portion of a frame not in order to transmit data but to im¬prove communication reliability. The simplest way to implement this is to have the mobile communication system and a mobile station negotiate an encryp¬tion algorithm and/or the parameters used by such an algorithm when the mo¬bile station registers for use of a data transmission service. Negotiation can take place even at the beginning of a data connection and possibly even dur¬ing a new connection. This kind of protection prevents an intruder from trans¬mitting false messages at least for a while as (s)he does not know which en¬cryption algorithm and/or parameter is being used. If the contents of the extra field do not comply with the protocol negotiated between the transmitter and the receiver, the frame may be rejected.<br>
An intruder can, however, send copies of frames (s)he has inter-<br><br>
cepted and interfere with communication integrity. Such interference can be prevented by modifying the contents of the extra information field between two successive frames sent over the air interface. In a simple and computationally preferable manner the extra information field is formed different in each suc¬cessive frame, e.g. so that the contents of each extra field comprise the GPRS frame number. The receiver can compare the frame number in the extra field with the frame number normally used on the connection, the number being sent either in the frame header, or alternatively the transmitter and the receiver can generate it themselves by assigning running numbers to the frames. If the frame number in the extra field does not comply with the frame number nor¬mally used on the connection, the frame may be rejected.<br>
in accordance with a preferable embodiment of the invention the protection is further improved. Although an intruder does not know the encryp¬tion key, (s)he may try to guess its contents and send random messages. At worst a receiver can interpret such a message as a command, e.g. a Logoff message causing connection setdown. By sending numerous random mes¬sages an intruder may interfere with communication on a GPRS connection, and hence is it preferable to further improve the protection. This can be done e.g. by adding another extra information field to the data portion of a GPRS frame, the contents of the field being formed by a different algorithm and/or parameters than the contents of the first extra information field.<br>
An advantage of the protection conforming with the invention is that an intruder cannot send unauthorized copies of messages transmitted on a GPRS connection. This is because the intruder does not know the algorithm and/or the parameters used in forming the extra information field. By placing an extra information field in the data portion of a frame, instead of the header, the mechanism for protecting the data portion by encryption, implemented in several systems, can be utilized. The protection of the invention is simple to implement. The data transmission layer and the layer handling encryption are independent of the method of the invention. Modifications may be needed in the message handling operations above or parallel to the encryption layer only. The operation of network elements between the transmitter and the re¬ceiver does not have to be modified. For these network elements the extra field of the invention is completely transparent. It has the same appearance as the rest of the contents of the data portion of a GPRS frame.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for data transmission between a transmitter and a receiver in a digital mobile communication system comprising at least one mobile station and at least one air interface, in which method: the data to be transmitted is assembled into frames comprising at least a header and a data portion; and frames are transmitted only when there is need for data transmission; characterized in that: an extra information field is added to the data portion of a frame, and the transmitter and the receiver negotiate between themselves an algorithm and/or a parameter on the basis of which the contents of the extra information field are formed.<br>
The invention is described further hereinafter, in connection with	<br><br>
preferable embodiments, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the parts of a mobile telephone network essential to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows the structure of a conventional GPRS frame used in communication between a mobile station and a GSN node;<br>
Figure 3 shows the structure of a secured GPRS frame of the in¬vention; and<br>
Figure 4 shows the structure of a double-secured GPRS frame of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows the structure of a secured GPRS frame F of the in¬vention. Let us assume first that the invention is applied to a system where the data portion of frame F is transmitted encrypted so that the encryption key is modified between two successive frames. Compared with a conventional frame shown in Figure 2, an extra information field 3 is added to the data por¬tion 2 of frame F of the invention, the contents of the field being different in each successive frame. The contents of the extra information field 3 can be simply the number of frame F. The receiver, i.e. a GSN node or a mobile sta¬tion MS, can compare the frame number in the extra field 3 with the frame number normally used on the connection and sent in the frame header 1. Al¬ternatively the transmitter and the receiver can develop the frame number themselves by assigning running numbers to frames F. If the frame number in the extra field 3 does not comply with the frame number normally used on the connection, the receiver may reject the frame.<br>
It is essential to the protection of the invention that the contents of the extra information field 3 are different in two successive frames sent over the air interface. In this case the contents of the extra information field 3 can also be the same in two successive frames before encryption as the extra in¬formation fields 3 in successive frames are made different by encryption. The contents of the extra information field 3 before encryption can be e.g. one of the following either wholly or partially:<br>
-	a constant<br>
-	the IMSI or MSISDN identity of a mobile station;<br>
-	a connection-specific identity; or<br>
-	a pseudo-random number.<br>
The identity of a mobile station can be its IMSI or MSISDN identity.<br><br>
In some systems, a difference may be made between the identity of a terminal and the identity of a mobile subscriber. As regards the invention, it is irrelevant whether the used identity identifies a terminal or a subscriber. As regards the invention, the identity of a mobile station may also be temporary, e.g. an iden¬tity negotiated between the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
A connection-specific identity is an identity Independent of the iden¬tity of a mobile station or a subscriber. It may be the identity TLLI of a tempo¬rary logical connection used on the connection. It may also be an identity a mobile station and a GSN node negotiate when the mobile station registers for use of a data transmission service. A mobile station and a GSN node may also negotiate a new temporary identity at the beginning of each connection or during the connection.<br>
A pseudo-random number is a number developed by a suitable pseudo-random algorithm so that only the transmitter and the receiver are aware of the used algorithm and/or the used parameters. Even if the algorithm generating the random number is in general knowledge, it may be thought that several alternative algorithms are in use, and the transmitter and the receiver negotiate the algorithm to be used one at a time. A random number has to be interpreted widely so that the term covers any form of a bit sequence. It is hence not necessary to confine oneself to bit groups corresponding to e.g. BCD coded numbers.<br>
If the invention is applied to a system where the data portion 2 of frame F is not sent encrypted, the contents of the extra information field 3 can be formed by an algorithm generating pseudo-random numbers so that the contents of field 3 are modified as soon as possible between two frames F sent over the air interface Urn. For security, it is preferable to use an algorithm that modifies the contents of field 3 between each two frames F.<br>
Figure 4 shows the structure of a GPRS frame conforming with a preferred embodiment of the invention. To further improve security, the data portion 2 of frame F also contains another information field 4. The contents of the other extra information field 4 can be formed by one of the above algo¬rithms, the algorithm being preferably different from the one used to form the first extra information field 3. Alternatively the same algorithm can be used to form the extra information fields 3 and 4, but with different parameters. If the data portion 2 of frame F is not sent encrypted, e.g. frame F number and an algorithm generating pseudo-random numbers can be used to form the infor-<br><br>
mation fields 3 and 4.<br>
It is not absolutely necessary for the contents of the extra informa¬tion fields 3 and/or 4 to be different in all frames used during the connection. The algorithm generating pseudo-random numbers, or at least one of them, may also be cyclic.<br>
It is obvious to those skilled in the art that the basic inventive idea can be implemented in a variety of ways. In the description of the invention it has been assumed, for the sake of clarity, that the functions controlling the packet radio operation have been concentrated to a GSN node. These func¬tions can, however, be integrated with other network elements, such as a base station, a base station controller, or a mobile services switching centre. In this case the sections of the network elements concerned controlling packet radio operation have to be understood to replace the GSN node. The other extra information field used in a preferred embodiment of the invention is an illustra¬tive concept, too. One may also think that one extra information field consists of two or more portions generated by two or more different algorithms, respec¬tively. Thus, the invention and its embodiments are not restricted to the above examples, but may vary within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br>
