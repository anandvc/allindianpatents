CROSS-REFFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/912,757 filed on April 19, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br>
1<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0028] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the embodiments of<br>
the transmission of the present invention have an arrangement of permanent<br>
mechanical connections between the elements of the four planetary gear sets in<br>
common. These mechanical connections generically link or relate the<br>
transmission embodiments. More specifically, a first component or element of a<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of<br>
8<br><br>
a second planetary gear set. A second component or element of the first<br>
planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a first component or element of a<br>
third planetary gear set. A third component or element of the first planetary gear<br>
set is permanently coupled to a ground or a transmission housing. A second<br>
component or element of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled<br>
to a second component or element of a third planetary gear set. A third<br>
component or element of the third planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a<br>
first component or element of a fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0029] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear are each<br>
represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. The<br>
relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate<br>
ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between<br>
the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal<br>
lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented<br>
as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
9<br><br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0030] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0031] The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to<br>
ground or the transmission housing 50. The second node 14B of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 18A of the third planetary gear<br>
set 18. The third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to second<br>
node 16B of the second planetary gear set 16. The third node 16C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to third node 18C of the third planetary<br>
gear set 18. The second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 is coupled<br>
to the first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The third node 20C of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20 is coupled to the input shaft or member 12. The<br>
output shaft or member 22 is coupled to the second node 20B of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20.<br>
[0032] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the input shaft or member<br>
12 to the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16. A second clutch 28<br>
10<br><br>
selectively connects the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 to the<br>
second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively<br>
connects the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 to the second<br>
node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14. Fourth clutch 32 selectively connects<br>
third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18 to second node 20B of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20. A brake 34 selectively connects the first node 18A<br>
of the third planetary gear set 18 to the ground or transmission housing 50.<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0034] For example, planetary gear set 14 is a planetary gear set that<br>
includes a sun gear member 14A, a planet gear carrier member 14B and a ring<br>
gear member 14C. Sun gear member 14A is connected to the ground or<br>
transmission housing 50 through a first interconnecting shaft or member 46. The<br>
planet gear carrier member 14B rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D<br>
(only one shown) and is connected for common rotation with first and second<br>
intermediate shafts or members 48 and 52. Planet gears 14D are each<br>
configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 14A and ring gear member<br>
11<br><br>
14C. Ring gear member 14C is connected for common rotation with a third<br>
intermediate shaft or member 54.<br>
[0035] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 22 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0036] Planetary gear set 16 is a planetary gear set that includes a sun<br>
gear member 16C, a planet carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet gears 16D and a ring gear member 16A. Sun gear member 16C is<br>
connected for common rotation with fourth and fifth intermediate shafts or<br>
members 56 and 58. Planet carrier member 16B is connected for common<br>
rotation with third intermediate shaft or member 54. Ring gear member 16A is<br>
connected for common rotation with a sixth intermediate shaft or member 60.<br>
Planet gears 16D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear member<br>
16C and ring gear member 16A.<br>
[0037] Planetary gear set 18 is a planetary gear set that includes a sun<br>
gear member 18C, a ring gear member 18A and a planet carrier member 18B<br>
that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 18D. Sun gear member 18C is<br>
connected for common rotation with fifth intermediate shaft or member 58. Ring<br>
gear member 18A is connected for common rotation with a seventh intermediate<br>
shaft or member 62. Planet carrier member 18B is connected for common<br>
rotation with an eighth intermediate shaft or member 64. Planet gears 18D are<br>
12<br><br>
each configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 18C and ring gear<br>
member 18A.<br>
[0038] Planetary gear set 20 is a planetary gear set that includes a sun<br>
gear member 20C, a ring gear member 20A and a planet carrier member 20B<br>
that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 20D. Sun gear member 20C is<br>
connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12. Ring gear<br>
member 20A is connected for common rotation with eighth intermediate shaft or<br>
member 64. Planet carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with<br>
output shaft or member 22 and ninth intermediate shaft or member 66. Planet<br>
gears 20D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 20C and<br>
ring gear member 20A.<br>
[0039] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32<br>
and brake 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect input shaft or member 12 to<br>
sixth intermediate shaft or member 60. Second clutch 28 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect sixth intermediate shaft or member 60 to ninth<br>
intermediate shaft or member 66. Third clutch 30 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect second intermediate shaft or member 52 to sixth intermediate shaft or<br>
member 60. Fourth clutch 32 is selectively engageable to connect fourth<br>
intermediate shaft or member 56 to sixth intermediate shaft or member 60.<br>
Brake 34 is selectively engageable to connect first and seventh intermediate<br>
13<br><br>
shafts or member 48 and 62 to transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation of<br>
shafts or members 48 and 62 relative to housing 50.<br>
[0040] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward<br>
speed or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each<br>
forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or<br>
more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 26, second clutch<br>
28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32 and brake 34), as will be explained below.<br>
FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states.<br>
Actual numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented<br>
although it should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only<br>
and that they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the<br>
gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending<br>
on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0041] To establish reverse gear, first clutch 26 and brake 34, are<br>
engaged or activated. First clutch 26 connects input shaft or member 12 to sixth<br>
intermediate shaft or member 60. Brake 34 connects first and seventh<br>
intermediate shafts or member 48 and 62 to transmission housing 50 to restrict<br>
14<br><br>
rotation of shafts or members 48 and 62 relative to housing 50. Likewise, the<br>
eight forward ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch<br>
engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0042] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches and the brake not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
